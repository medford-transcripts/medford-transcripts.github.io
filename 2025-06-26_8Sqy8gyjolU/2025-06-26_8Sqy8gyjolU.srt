[SPEAKER_19]: Christy Dowd, board member.

42
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:45,089
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm pretty sure everybody is here tonight in attendance.

43
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

44
00:03:48,332 --> 00:03:53,837
[SPEAKER_19]: Andre, just before you read the announcement for BJ's, I just wanted to announce, just to remind

45
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:09,731
[SPEAKER_19]: the board and the public that I recused myself from review of this project last time due to a potential conflict of interest with Stantec, the firm that I work with providing environmental consulting and engineering for the project.

46
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:13,774
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, I will recuse myself from this item on the agenda tonight.

47
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:18,338
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will mute and stop my video for that portion of the agenda.

48
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

49
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:29,016
[SPEAKER_14]: And Katie, you were not in attendance last time.

50
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:35,621
[SPEAKER_14]: So could you also just state for the record that you have watched and listened to the recording from August 20th?

51
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:44,648
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I was not in attendance on August 20th, but I have watched and listened to and reviewed the recording from the August 20th meeting.

52
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:46,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you.

53
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:50,512
[SPEAKER_14]: You've also submitted written confirmation of such to the Office of Community Development.

54
00:04:55,117 --> 00:05:01,814
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a continuation of the hearing that opened on June 18, 2020 and was continued last month to tonight.

55
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:25,776
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, June 18, 2020 at 6.45 PM via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a special permit slash site plan review application submitted by BJ's Wholesale Club to construct a self-service fueling station within a portion of the existing parking area at 278 and 0 Middlesex Avenue and allowed use in an industrial zoning district.

56
00:05:26,316 --> 00:05:32,461
[SPEAKER_14]: The site is currently occupied by an existing BJ's Wholesale Club with associated surface parking and site improvements.

57
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:46,556
[SPEAKER_14]: The proposed facility will be comprised of a more or less 200 square foot kiosk slash gasoline attendant facility with canopy more or less 4,525 square feet and a six dispenser service pump island.

58
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:53,083
[SPEAKER_14]: A copy of the application may be viewed in the office of community development room 308 from the city's website at

59
00:05:53,743 --> 00:06:02,910
[SPEAKER_14]: www.medfordma.org slash departments slash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings.

60
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:15,080
[SPEAKER_14]: At this time, I would like to ask the applicant represented by Mark Vaughan to present any revisions and updates to the plans.

61
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

62
00:06:20,102 --> 00:06:24,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Pleasure to be before you again this evening in this virtual setting.

63
00:06:24,105 --> 00:06:25,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope you're all doing well.

64
00:06:26,006 --> 00:06:29,708
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do not have a lot to say this evening.

65
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:31,729
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure you'll be pleased to hear that.

66
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:42,176
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that we've had, I think this is our fourth hearing with you and certainly appreciate all the input, time, and attention that the board has put on this.

67
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:45,598
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's resulted in a much better plan.

68
00:06:47,537 --> 00:07:10,302
[SPEAKER_11]: What I thought might be helpful, just given that it's been a month since we appeared before you, and also with the board member who I know, board member McHugh, having listened to the tape, I thought it might be helpful if I just had Austin Turner, our engineer, engineering, and Sean Kelly very briefly just summarize again the modifications that have been made to the plan.

69
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:14,443
[SPEAKER_11]: that we're seeking approval of and have before you.

70
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,584
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not gonna give a summary of what the project is.

71
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:19,965
[SPEAKER_11]: I think everyone on the board understands it at this point.

72
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:36,033
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing I will add is just to remind the board, we did submit back in June how, in our opinion, the project does comply and satisfy the various site plan special permit standards that are set forth in your zoning bylaw.

73
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:52,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I think in as much as we felt that the project, as it was comprised then, met all the criteria, I think even more so now, just given the additional modifications, additional landscaping, traffic improvements and the like that we have made.

74
00:07:52,747 --> 00:07:54,728
[SPEAKER_11]: So appreciate your time.

75
00:07:54,808 --> 00:08:02,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the board is so willing, I'd like to turn it over to Austin to just briefly walk through and summarize the changes that we've made.

76
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:18,039
[SPEAKER_11]: and a couple of other tweaks to the plan since the last meeting in August, including the elimination of the dumpster, which we can explain, as well as some EV parking, car charging stations spaces, too.

77
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:18,820
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

78
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:22,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mark, and good evening.

79
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Austin Turner with Bowler.

80
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:29,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'll do is just as Mark mentioned, I'll give you just a quick recap.

81
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,480
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a month and talk about how the project has evolved just quickly.

82
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the recent updates that we had introduced subsequent to our prior discussion.

83
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:49,285
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, I was gonna share my screen if somebody could authorize me to do such things that would be standing.

84
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:06,272
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, Annie's the only one who has the ability to do that.

85
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:10,174
[SPEAKER_18]: And she seems to be having a network problem.

86
00:09:14,017 --> 00:09:14,697
[SPEAKER_24]: It might have worked.

87
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:17,759
[SPEAKER_24]: It just popped up on my screen and said he was co-host, I think.

88
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,581
[SPEAKER_06]: It just worked.

89
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it just came up.

90
00:09:21,022 --> 00:09:22,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

91
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,667
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, everybody see that all right?

92
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:32,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

93
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:46,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're probably familiar with this, this exhibit, we had used this to kind of summarize the global changes that have been made to the project, which I'll quickly summarize again, I'll go on kind of an encounter clockwise fashion.

94
00:09:47,426 --> 00:10:05,702
[SPEAKER_06]: starting big picture, and Sean will summarize this again as well, through our conversations with the board and the feedback we've received, the product is agreeing to introduce the bike lanes and the re-striping on Middlesex Avenue that we had discussed.

95
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:13,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we have to make sure that DOT is in agreement with that as well, but to the extent that they are, the applicant is agreeing to

96
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:28,637
[SPEAKER_06]: construct nearly 1300 feet of bike lane improvements and off-site improvements in Middlesex Avenue, which we thought was a fairly big benefit, both the community and a nice add that the project was willing to do.

97
00:10:29,577 --> 00:10:40,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Related to that, as you kind of get more into the project frontage, we have been able to provide some reduction in width of the driveway out onto Middlesex Avenue.

98
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,674
[SPEAKER_06]: With that is going to come sidewalk improvements along the frontage of the project.

99
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:54,562
[SPEAKER_06]: The sidewalk that's located here will be reconstructed and brought into current accessibility compliance.

100
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:16,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, in the vein of pedestrian connectivity, we have incorporated into the site plans a pedestrian connection from the pedestrian sidewalk on Middlesex Avenue to the front door of the existing BJ's Club, which is going to be located along, I'm going to call it the top of the property, but as you can see my cursor tracing here,

101
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:28,214
[SPEAKER_06]: that sidewalk will be located on what is currently parking lot, but will be along that frontage and provides a direct connection from the sidewalk on Middlesex Avenue to the club.

102
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:31,459
[SPEAKER_06]: As we're continuing.

103
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:34,507
[SPEAKER_06]: to advance into the site plan.

104
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:44,693
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the changes that we have introduced from the initial application was the inclusion of a very large landscape island immediately adjacent to the canopy and the fueling position.

105
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That was done as a direct result of some feedback by members of the board.

106
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,198
[SPEAKER_06]: We originally, if you recall, had a driveway in that location.

107
00:11:54,183 --> 00:12:01,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And that driveway, there was some discussion about that driveway or the fear that that driveway may present some potential conflict for turning movements.

108
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:07,152
[SPEAKER_06]: In consideration of that, we just removed it and made it a large landscaped island.

109
00:12:08,255 --> 00:12:22,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And similarly, we're adding a number of different landscape islands interior to the property, including some enhancement of the screening between the project and Woodruff Avenue.

110
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:30,746
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like historically some of that vegetation hasn't survived, and it looks like it may have been compromised at some point in the past as a result of some utility work.

111
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:34,508
[SPEAKER_06]: With that in mind, this project is proposing to kind of reestablish

112
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:40,612
[SPEAKER_06]: reestablish the vegetative buffer along Woodruff Avenue.

113
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:50,160
[SPEAKER_06]: As Mark had mentioned, we're also proposing the inclusion of electrical vehicle charging spaces.

114
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:59,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And those spaces, as you can see, this is kind of the overall site plan view, but those spaces are going to be located in this general hatched area over here.

115
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:03,555
[SPEAKER_06]: So BJ's has been able to provide those.

116
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:07,898
[SPEAKER_06]: They've reached an agreement with a provider for that service.

117
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is part of this program that we're proposing.

118
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Last month, we had told you that we were pretty close to being able to commit to that.

119
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:19,387
[SPEAKER_06]: And as of this evening, we are able to fully commit to the installation of those.

120
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:22,189
[SPEAKER_06]: for EV charging stations.

121
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:31,519
[SPEAKER_06]: One other item too that was discussed at our last meeting was the removal and or relocation

122
00:13:32,593 --> 00:13:34,894
[SPEAKER_06]: of the trash enclosure.

123
00:13:35,374 --> 00:13:41,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you recall, originally the trash enclosure was generally located in this corner in proximate to Middlesex Avenue.

124
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:45,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We had worked with the BJ's operations team on this.

125
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:53,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we were originally considering was relocating it further interior to the property and into that large new landscaped island that we had added.

126
00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:03,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we found actually is operationally and with the fact that this station is located within the parking lot of an existing club, we're actually eliminating it altogether.

127
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:10,542
[SPEAKER_06]: So what will happen is the existing enclosures and existing trash facilities associated with the club will be used

128
00:14:11,363 --> 00:14:26,874
[SPEAKER_06]: to collect the trash for the receptacles that are out here and how that works essentially is the attendant will be responsible for maintaining those trash enclosures on a daily basis or is not as needed basis will remove that trash and then bring it to the facilities that are inside the club.

129
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:32,979
[SPEAKER_06]: So what that does is affords us the opportunity just to remove the enclosure altogether with it being proximate to Middlesex Avenue

130
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,900
[SPEAKER_06]: we understood that there was some concern about the aesthetic of that.

131
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:44,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with that in mind, we've just removed it altogether and operationally from BJ's perspective, that is fine and consistent with some of their other locations as well.

132
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:49,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of the high altitude recap.

133
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:54,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean to run through the product in its entirety again, and Sean will touch on some of the traffic related components.

134
00:14:55,705 --> 00:15:01,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions before we transition over to Sean on some of the site related features that I just quickly summarized?

135
00:15:09,627 --> 00:15:12,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing none, should I flip it over to Mr. Kelly?

136
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,432
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, please.

137
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:17,492
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

138
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:19,614
[SPEAKER_26]: Good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

139
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:22,156
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, for the record, Sean Kelly with Van Asken Associates.

140
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:24,337
[SPEAKER_26]: On behalf of the team, thank you again for having us tonight.

141
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:33,464
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of this might be duplicating Austin's presentation, but I think what I'd like to do is just walk through some of the improvements that we're proposing as they relate to traffic.

142
00:15:34,384 --> 00:15:37,865
[SPEAKER_26]: We have had meetings with Tim McGivern and Todd Blake in the engineering department.

143
00:15:38,426 --> 00:15:50,970
[SPEAKER_26]: And while this is an auto-oriented development given the gas station nature, the feedback we received from the city was that really the thrust of the improvements relative to traffic they were looking for was pedestrian and bicycle accommodations.

144
00:15:51,471 --> 00:15:57,433
[SPEAKER_26]: Today the site, quite frankly, doesn't have a lot of ADA compliance, doesn't have direct pedestrian connections to the store.

145
00:15:58,553 --> 00:16:02,854
[SPEAKER_26]: So we've made a number of commitments to upgrade the existing infrastructure that exists today.

146
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:10,976
[SPEAKER_26]: On the Fellsway side, that corridor was recently upgraded with new bicycle lanes, but our driveway doesn't meet ADA compliance.

147
00:16:11,657 --> 00:16:14,197
[SPEAKER_26]: The wheelchair ramps don't meet current standards.

148
00:16:14,237 --> 00:16:23,400
[SPEAKER_26]: The Delta Island doesn't provide the appropriate pedestrian path through, and we've committed to working with MDC to upgrade that to meet current design criteria.

149
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Similarly, on the Middlesex Avenue side, again, it's a wide driveway.

150
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:30,467
[SPEAKER_26]: We've looked at the geometry.

151
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:32,649
[SPEAKER_26]: We've looked at what we need to accommodate truck movements.

152
00:16:33,289 --> 00:16:42,919
[SPEAKER_26]: And we've proposed to narrow that to the extent feasible to shorten that pedestrian crossing while still ensuring that truck movements can occur safely in and out of the site.

153
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:57,986
[SPEAKER_26]: In conjunction with that, similar to what we're proposing at Fellsway, we would put a painted crosswalk across the driveway, bring the ramps up to ADA compliance, reconstruct the sidewalk along our frontage, which, you know, will be in better shape post-development.

154
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:06,410
[SPEAKER_26]: And then really, I think, probably the most significant pedestrian improvement in terms of, you know, for Middlesex Avenue, as Austin noted on, is really providing a dedicated sidewalk that runs

155
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:10,475
[SPEAKER_26]: from the corridor directly to the store in the northern edge of the site.

156
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:17,006
[SPEAKER_26]: Today, pedestrians that want to walk the store, you know, walk down the driveway and they share that space with vehicles, which isn't ideal.

157
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:21,192
[SPEAKER_26]: This certainly represents an improvement in terms of pedestrian accessibility.

158
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:29,119
[SPEAKER_26]: With regard to bicycle accommodations, again, we did speak with Todd Blake, city traffic engineer.

159
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:39,064
[SPEAKER_26]: We understand that the desire to implement a complete streets design along Middlesex Avenue and the areas that are controlled in the vicinity of our site.

160
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:46,808
[SPEAKER_26]: This is mass DOT jurisdiction, so we will ultimately need to get them to sign off, but we have run this by them and they seem in agreement with it.

161
00:17:47,708 --> 00:18:03,044
[SPEAKER_26]: As you can see in the plan that's up here now, the elements of the plan would be to have an actual dedicated bicycle lane that would run from the city line, which is up in the vicinity of Wendy's, runs south all the way down to First Street.

162
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:10,332
[SPEAKER_26]: And in that area, you again would have a bike lane that's dedicated with a buffered cross-hatched area to delineate the separation from vehicular and

163
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:12,563
[SPEAKER_26]: and bicycle flows.

164
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:21,207
[SPEAKER_26]: And then from 1st Street down to 5th, it would be a shared configuration with share roads installed along the corridor, as well as signage to share the road.

165
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:25,609
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, we've presented this to your engineering department for consideration.

166
00:18:25,649 --> 00:18:30,632
[SPEAKER_26]: And if we agree to amass DOTs on board, we're committed to putting these measures in place.

167
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,853
[SPEAKER_26]: We feel these are what the city had indicated they were looking for.

168
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:50,815
[SPEAKER_26]: And while, again, while this is a project that will generate automobile traffic, we think these measures will certainly enhance the pedestrian and bicycle realm and will ultimately be an improvement to not only pedestrians and bicyclists destined to BJs, but also all users along the corridors.

169
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:53,656
[SPEAKER_26]: That's, I think, all I have for tonight.

170
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:56,336
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd be happy to, again, answer any questions that members of the boards might have.

171
00:18:57,597 --> 00:18:57,877
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

172
00:18:59,357 --> 00:18:59,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

173
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:00,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

174
00:19:00,908 --> 00:19:16,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Kelly, at this point, I'd like to ask the city's traffic engineer, Todd Blake, to give his comments about the proposal and whether there's any outstanding issues from his perspective.

175
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:19,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

176
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:28,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, as was mentioned, a lot of things have changed since the original proposal, and it's changed for the better.

177
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:33,707
[SPEAKER_04]: are for the following for additional consideration for the board.

178
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:35,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have any new written comments.

179
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going back to my old written comments to see if point by point if they're addressed.

180
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:47,896
[SPEAKER_04]: It does appear like most of them have been, but there may be a couple of areas for your consideration.

181
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:52,519
[SPEAKER_04]: So circulation wise, they have improved things a lot.

182
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:58,262
[SPEAKER_04]: They have added the cross, the sidewalk from Middlesex Ave to the BJ's entrance.

183
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:02,323
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I'll say about that, it is a very good feature to add.

184
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:03,783
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

185
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just suggest adding some guide signage.

186
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: For Medford residents coming from the south on Middlesex Ave, their tendency might be to hang a left in the main drive, thinking that the walkway is there to the center building.

187
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:24,827
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have to cross the drive, hit the corner probably and take a left to use that sidewalk.

188
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,388
[SPEAKER_04]: So it might be good to add a sign at the site drive and also

189
00:20:28,902 --> 00:20:38,906
[SPEAKER_04]: where they make the turn onto the sidewalk, because it may not be as apparent that that sidewalk exists up there on the north side of the site, or on the Malden side.

190
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:48,189
[SPEAKER_04]: The bike lanes, we did ask for a bicycle infrastructure on the Middlesex Avenue corridor, and they did do that, and it looks great.

191
00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:56,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in my comments, we had said to consider from 5th to 9th as well with Sheroes, so that's up to the board's discretion.

192
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:04,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, the share is in that fifth, which would leave a gap between fifth and ninth that the state would have to kind of come back and do at some point.

193
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:18,615
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as pedestrian connections, it looks like looking at my original memo, we had talked about improving pedestrian access from the Fellsway side as well.

194
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:24,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure that piece was fully addressed necessarily.

195
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:34,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're upgrading the ramps at the drive on the Fellsway West side, but I don't necessarily think they're adding a pedestrian connection from Fellsway to the front door.

196
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:37,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something to consider when you deliberate.

197
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:41,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Just gonna check to see if there's a few more.

198
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:48,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that's it.

199
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,132
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously they have narrowed the,

200
00:21:51,765 --> 00:22:02,431
[SPEAKER_04]: the drive at Middlesex Ave, but I didn't know if it met the needs fully of what was described several meetings back about potentially narrowing even more, so.

201
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:10,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you, Engineer Blake.

202
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:19,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I would let the proponent like to respond to those issues and whether they might be willing to consider them if they haven't already addressed them.

203
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:26,926
[SPEAKER_11]: I can start.

204
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:27,906
[SPEAKER_11]: This is Mark Vaughn.

205
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:34,529
[SPEAKER_11]: I think with respect to the, I try to take some notes here, the signage for the pedestrian walkway.

206
00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:45,694
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we're certainly amenable to that and whatever signage the city thinks might be appropriate to help better guide pedestrians to where the sidewalk is.

207
00:22:47,174 --> 00:22:52,577
[SPEAKER_11]: I think with respect to the other comment about the Shiros, I'll defer to,

208
00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:05,088
[SPEAKER_11]: Either Sean, or we also have, that you have not heard from yet, but if you recall from prior meetings, Patrick Netriba, who's with BJ's, I know he's here tonight as well.

209
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:10,893
[SPEAKER_11]: But Sean, do you want to comment on?

210
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:15,683
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, I think we could certainly look at the share rows from 5th to 9th.

211
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:22,205
[SPEAKER_26]: The comment letter did recommend considering it, but obviously 1st to 5th was the area where it was designated it was wanted.

212
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:25,585
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's something we can take a look at.

213
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:31,107
[SPEAKER_26]: And then with respect to the pedestrian access from Fellsway,

214
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,149
[SPEAKER_26]: The backdoor of the from Felsbury is really the loading area, there isn't a very convenient way to bring pedestrian traffic into that area.

215
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:49,658
[SPEAKER_26]: drive aisle that runs between the building and Woodroof Avenue, but that, you know, accommodates two-way traffic flow today.

216
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:55,781
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, there's a number of stop signs along there and we did understand there's some concerns about vehicle speeds and what have you.

217
00:23:56,741 --> 00:24:05,365
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure it's technically feasible to get a pedestrian walkway in there in a safe manner that can also accommodate two-way traffic flow, you know, in both directions to the side of the store.

218
00:24:05,425 --> 00:24:10,447
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know, we haven't proposed a dedicated route there because I'm not sure we actually could fit it in a safe manner.

219
00:24:16,532 --> 00:24:16,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

220
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:25,364
[SPEAKER_14]: Does Mr. Netriba want to say a few words at this time?

221
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:27,998
[SPEAKER_10]: No, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

222
00:24:28,018 --> 00:24:28,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

223
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:35,641
[SPEAKER_10]: None other than to say thank you to the board and to you for your help in making this better.

224
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:38,302
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a process, and we appreciate it.

225
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:44,504
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're a member of your community, and we want to continue to be so, and we want to be better every day.

226
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,305
[SPEAKER_10]: That's our goal.

227
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:47,005
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you very much.

228
00:24:47,045 --> 00:24:47,646
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all I have.

229
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:49,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

230
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:52,688
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we appreciate the willingness

231
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:58,473
[SPEAKER_14]: to listen to our feedback and to try to accommodate what's been suggested.

232
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:01,820
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that there's been a lot of improvements here to the project.

233
00:25:02,573 --> 00:25:13,920
[SPEAKER_14]: So for the reopened public hearing, let me first take any questions from the board and then I'll reopen the floor for public comments.

234
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,943
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we will move on to, I'll close that and we'll move on to deliberation.

235
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:21,265
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me open to board members.

236
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:24,987
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have any questions or comments at this time?

237
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:28,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Andre, this is Jackie Patato.

238
00:25:28,248 --> 00:25:29,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I have one quick question.

239
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:39,537
[SPEAKER_12]: It was iterated that there's a portion of the street that is owned by state and that the proponent would be coordinating with MassDOT.

240
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:46,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just wondering, out of curiosity, because I have not looked further into this, if there will be any kind of access permit that is needed.

241
00:25:46,603 --> 00:25:53,368
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why I ask, I'm just wondering if that would change the design of what MassDOT is considering versus what the proponent is considering.

242
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:55,250
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my only question.

243
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:05,920
[SPEAKER_26]: but the project will require an access permit from MassDOT because of the, we're doing some geometric changes to the driveway to narrow it up, including the ramps and the crosswalks.

244
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,800
[SPEAKER_26]: So we will need a permit.

245
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,583
[SPEAKER_26]: I suspect as part of that permit filing, we'll probably try to get the bicycle accommodations done as well.

246
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,365
[SPEAKER_26]: And again, this is a conceptual plan.

247
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:18,506
[SPEAKER_26]: We're certainly gonna get feedback from DOT in terms of the engineering design.

248
00:26:18,526 --> 00:26:23,769
[SPEAKER_26]: I expect there will be some changes, but I think the general thrust is that we will have that exclusive bicycle lane

249
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,090
[SPEAKER_26]: along our frontage, and again, leading up to the city line in Malden.

250
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

251
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:35,352
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just thinking holistically and as a whole, I know that we're interested in getting 5th to the 9th.

252
00:26:35,592 --> 00:26:43,694
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not speaking on behalf of the state, but I'm just wondering if this was kind of an area or an opportunity to have that full conversation.

253
00:26:45,795 --> 00:26:46,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

254
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, if I may.

255
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. Blake.

256
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:53,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the board members,

257
00:26:54,297 --> 00:27:07,246
[SPEAKER_04]: background or point of information for the locus street project was completely separate project just as an example that had conditions that were subject to the state at the locus street and mystic Valley Parkway traffic signal.

258
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:21,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And the state did end up agreeing in that case, and there were some design changes back and forth but very minor and the intent was kept so if, if the applicant says they already reached out to master master to minimal.

259
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:32,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine it would be a similar case where that maybe some tweaks here and there, but as long as the intent is satisfied, hopefully they'll go along with it.

260
00:27:32,888 --> 00:27:44,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had a conversation with MassDOT yet about it, but they do have state directives that indicate improving bicycle infrastructure, so I don't see why they wouldn't.

261
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:50,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for mentioning that, for point of information.

262
00:27:50,548 --> 00:27:57,210
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, full disclosure, I do work for the state, but I cannot speak on behalf of the state.

263
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:01,852
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's where I was going when I was asking the proponent about that information.

264
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:02,552
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

265
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:09,014
[SPEAKER_14]: And just for the record, Jackie works for a different agency, not for MassDOT.

266
00:28:09,574 --> 00:28:10,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Not for MassDOT.

267
00:28:14,432 --> 00:28:16,553
[SPEAKER_14]: So here we would do the same thing.

268
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:28,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we would include conditions that had the sharrows and obviously we'd have to be subject to approval by MassDOT.

269
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:36,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Other board members, comments or questions?

270
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:47,294
[SPEAKER_21]: Gray, I have questions.

271
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:49,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, go ahead.

272
00:28:49,755 --> 00:29:10,903
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so I was thinking about the request by the engineering department to create some sort of pedestrian connections on the west side of the site.

273
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:21,078
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, it seems that the response from the proponent was very reasonable.

274
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:33,643
[SPEAKER_21]: I've driven through there, and I know that, you know, it's a very sort of working, loading type parking lot in the back.

275
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:41,946
[SPEAKER_21]: I got on Google Street View when I was looking at the area, and again, I think what he was saying made a lot of sense.

276
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:56,544
[SPEAKER_21]: I did make the unfortunate turn onto Woodruff Ave and have a look at the condition, assuming that the Google Street View is the current condition.

277
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:06,229
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was looking at the condition of the edge between the store and Woodruff Ave.

278
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:11,731
[SPEAKER_21]: And there's just two things that just jumped right out at me, and I think either

279
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:23,511
[SPEAKER_21]: two or three meetings ago, we heard from a number of people in the neighborhood, including one of the city councilors who lives in the neighborhood on this issue.

280
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:28,093
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can't really remember where things were left.

281
00:30:28,173 --> 00:30:41,096
[SPEAKER_21]: But anyway, my comment is that when I look on Google Street View, I see this chain link fence with a pretty beat down

282
00:30:44,757 --> 00:30:58,966
[SPEAKER_21]: series of green slats and what seems to me zero pedestrian connections between Woodruff Ave and the store.

283
00:30:59,886 --> 00:31:13,094
[SPEAKER_21]: And what's interesting about that is that while I agree that connections to the Fellsway may not be feasible, it seems to me a good

284
00:31:14,462 --> 00:31:31,072
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, a good sort of middle ground might be to sort of dress up the edge of Woodruff Ave, which we really haven't talked about too much and actually create some pedestrian connections there where people could get out, um, you know, through the adjacent streets.

285
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:42,659
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, this is again, just something that jumped into my head as, as I started looking around, um, on Google, but, um, cause I, cause I do think, you know,

286
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,490
[SPEAKER_21]: those pedestrian connections are important.

287
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:53,053
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've certainly heard from the neighborhood.

288
00:31:53,113 --> 00:32:06,180
[SPEAKER_21]: And then just aesthetically, that edge is just a series of either dead or dying trees and old mulch and a really beat up fence.

289
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,122
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think they're, you know,

290
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:16,905
[SPEAKER_21]: the issue of connectivity through the site could be addressed along that edge rather than on the Fellsway edge.

291
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:19,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Klaus.

292
00:32:20,168 --> 00:32:24,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Attorney Vaughn, would you or one of your team members speak to that?

293
00:32:26,575 --> 00:32:27,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, why don't I start?

294
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:34,358
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that I understand Klaus's point there with respect to the edge.

295
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:43,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And one thing I do want to mention that Austin touched upon in the presentation is that we did, although it's not really, I'm going to say,

296
00:32:44,898 --> 00:33:07,507
[SPEAKER_11]: relevant or there's a nexus with the gasoline station itself, but because, you know, the gas station is up at that corner, you know, right along Middle 6 Ave, but you'll see on this rendering that we have provided for additional vegetation along the perimeter of our property along Woodruff Avenue to restore vegetation there and make for a

297
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:15,330
[SPEAKER_11]: a nicer buffer between our site and Woodruff Avenue and the residential neighborhood that's there.

298
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:27,295
[SPEAKER_11]: With respect to, if I understood the comment about providing a residential connection through there, I'm not sure we're against that or adverse to it.

299
00:33:27,635 --> 00:33:32,177
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what the neighborhood feeling would be about it in terms of, you know,

300
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:39,137
[SPEAKER_11]: providing for additional folks walking back and forth into the neighborhood from there.

301
00:33:40,078 --> 00:33:55,454
[SPEAKER_11]: But certainly something that we could look at in the future if that's something that folks felt made sense, but I don't know what the overall feeling with that would be from the neighborhood.

302
00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:08,862
[SPEAKER_14]: And Attorney Vaughn, is there any plans to, we've discussed the enhanced landscaping and vegetative screening for that piece between Woodruff and the front of the store.

303
00:34:09,342 --> 00:34:22,071
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any plans to just improve the condition of the chain link fence along that edge or to replace that screening which might be deteriorated?

304
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:28,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark, I can speak to that one if you don't mind.

305
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, please.

306
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:30,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, certainly.

307
00:34:30,542 --> 00:34:39,912
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, we actually are going to be upgrading or replacing the slats in the fence, in particular, on both sides of the property.

308
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:47,579
[SPEAKER_06]: A similar fence does exist on the opposite side, but we are, as part of this project, replacing those slats and kind of

309
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,623
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing them into a state of repair, if you will, and putting new slats in.

310
00:34:52,643 --> 00:34:58,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's been contemplated and is actually being currently orchestrated with the folks from the BJS operation team.

311
00:34:58,747 --> 00:35:03,330
[SPEAKER_06]: So that fence is, you know, if there are slats that are broken or not serving their intended purpose, they're going to be replaced.

312
00:35:04,931 --> 00:35:17,600
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mr. Turner, was there ever any conversation with the neighborhood residents about the question of access from Woodruff Avenue, either pro or against?

313
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't spoken to them directly.

314
00:35:20,799 --> 00:35:29,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't recall there being much discussion as part of these proceedings, you know, from our initial discussion with the board to this evening.

315
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:40,798
[SPEAKER_06]: As Mr. Vaughn mentioned, if there was a desire from the folks who live on Woodruff Avenue or the streets surrounding there for some kind of connection, we could talk to Patrick and the folks over at BJ's about

316
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:42,159
[SPEAKER_06]: accommodating that.

317
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:43,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we said, we're not adverse to it.

318
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,683
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want to do something somebody doesn't want, though.

319
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:50,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they do, we'll talk to them about what makes sense and how to accomplish that.

320
00:35:50,647 --> 00:35:53,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

321
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:56,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Chairman, if I may.

322
00:35:57,214 --> 00:35:58,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. Blake.

323
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:04,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I did mention that the original engineering comment letter, we had a big asterisk next to it.

324
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:12,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So we said, increase pedestrian access from Millsex, Fellsway, and then the third was from the neighborhood, but only if the neighborhood wanted it.

325
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:16,816
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually very neighborhood dependent, case by case.

326
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:26,381
[SPEAKER_04]: But the pedestrian access from Fellsway, yeah, I do get how it's currently more of a delivery entrance, but,

327
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:40,147
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone that's a resident in Medford that lives in East Medford Glenwood area that might be using the second street or Myrtle Street crosswalks across the fells, that's the way they would come in, regardless of where the front door is.

328
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:43,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's why we had it in there.

329
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:52,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't explore a lot of design options myself, but there is a one-way drive aisle on the north of the building, and there's a two-way on the south.

330
00:36:53,271 --> 00:36:56,732
[SPEAKER_04]: There may, again, I didn't look into designing this, but there may be an opportunity

331
00:36:57,412 --> 00:37:07,719
[SPEAKER_04]: have one way west on the north side as it is, and one way east on the south side, which would gain a lane for walkway and potentially more landscaping on the south side of the building?

332
00:37:12,622 --> 00:37:25,251
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I sort of see where you're going with that, Tim, and I sort of contemplated the same thing, but when I made my comment, it just seemed to me that the connection threw into a neighborhood

333
00:37:25,928 --> 00:37:36,475
[SPEAKER_21]: might be a lot more viable and meaningful than just getting out to the Fellsway, which there's not a lot going on there.

334
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:39,077
[SPEAKER_21]: It's sort of a bridge.

335
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:49,683
[SPEAKER_21]: And I guess my only follow-up question to Austin would be, you said you're going to replace the slats.

336
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:53,466
[SPEAKER_21]: In my opinion, that's a system that

337
00:37:56,778 --> 00:38:00,180
[SPEAKER_21]: doesn't present well after six months.

338
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:06,343
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm wondering if there's something that we can do.

339
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:12,826
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate that you're enhancing the landscaping, but you're really only doing it up against the parking lot.

340
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:23,311
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's about 40% of the whole length of Woodruff Street, or less even, if you go past Bradbury.

341
00:38:27,062 --> 00:38:32,726
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to have this nice landscaping for the first however many, a couple hundred feet.

342
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:40,272
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the rest, it's going to be back to looking at a street and the side of a building, I suppose.

343
00:38:42,693 --> 00:38:45,555
[SPEAKER_21]: I just sort of wonder why that landscaping just doesn't keep going.

344
00:38:45,595 --> 00:38:53,041
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think I know the answer is that the street sort of comes up right up against the fence.

345
00:38:55,535 --> 00:39:03,917
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm seeing a vegetated landscape between the fence and Woodruff Ave.

346
00:39:04,797 --> 00:39:09,278
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that on your property, or is that city property?

347
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:20,080
[SPEAKER_21]: Because there seems to be plenty of room to landscape the whole length of Woodruff rather than just this one little piece.

348
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Through the chair, if you don't mind, is it OK if I answer directly?

349
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:24,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

350
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:36,059
[SPEAKER_06]: So to answer that question, that part of the site, if you will, as you've mentioned, it's very narrow there.

351
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,121
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have room.

352
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:57,242
[SPEAKER_06]: even if it's a little bit limited to do the landscaping where we're currently proposing to do it, that the ability to do that gets substantially reduced as you get further along the building side, just given the narrow limits of the driveway against Woodruff Avenue and how those things kind of are separated just by the fence.

353
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:02,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's limited opportunity, if any, to do some landscaping there.

354
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:07,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe that landscaping bed is on the city's right-of-way, even if that fence splits it.

355
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:10,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the landscaping bed is actually on the city's right-of-way there.

356
00:40:13,395 --> 00:40:16,576
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know that we can upgrade defense necessarily.

357
00:40:16,636 --> 00:40:23,578
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are parts of defense that just clearly need to be upgraded because it hasn't done well over the years, we can entertain that with the folks at BJS.

358
00:40:23,698 --> 00:40:31,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that we're going to be able to replace it in its entirety and especially given some of the commitments that we've made here to do those things.

359
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,220
[SPEAKER_06]: So

360
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:38,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's limited opportunity to do some additional landscaping there.

361
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:43,189
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can accommodate it, we will, but I don't want to promise you that we can actually do that given the spatial limitations that we have.

362
00:40:43,209 --> 00:40:44,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

363
00:40:44,790 --> 00:41:02,565
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, I would be inclined to leave it up to the city whether to convene a follow-up meeting with neighborhood residents in that area with BJs for any further possible improvements or issues that need to be addressed.

364
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:07,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and then I know that there was some brief discussion about the sidewalk connectivity.

365
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:21,590
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can understand on the surface, how it might look like, yeah, we have a lane to reduce, but really what that upper driveway, this upper driveway here, that's really intended to get delivery trucks out of the circulation patterns of the primary part of the site.

366
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,651
[SPEAKER_06]: And that that driveway is really utilitarian.

367
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:25,893
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not intended for customer vehicle traffic.

368
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:31,899
[SPEAKER_06]: One, because we don't want customer vehicle traffic interacting with kind of the nerve center of the property and the loading.

369
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:38,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Eliminating this and making it one-way drive means anybody who wants to go out to the Fells is going to go along and introduce there.

370
00:41:38,882 --> 00:41:44,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not something we want to introduce or consider at this point.

371
00:41:49,847 --> 00:41:51,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Other comments by board members or questions?

372
00:41:56,957 --> 00:42:01,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Hearing none, I'd like to reopen the public comment portion of the meeting.

373
00:42:01,898 --> 00:42:07,880
[SPEAKER_14]: And Annie and Alicia, if you could help me call on members of the public, that'd be great.

374
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:19,644
[SPEAKER_14]: I see Jessica Wall.

375
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:19,704
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi.

376
00:42:19,864 --> 00:42:20,804
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening, everybody.

377
00:42:20,824 --> 00:42:23,325
[SPEAKER_24]: And good evening, members of the board.

378
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:24,485
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Jessica Wall.

379
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,646
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm an attorney at Anderson and Krieger in Boston.

380
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:32,672
[SPEAKER_24]: I represent SF Medford Investments and also a group of Wellington residents opposed to the project.

381
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:40,077
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to thank you for the opportunity to comment this evening and for your continued consideration of our comments on the project.

382
00:42:40,917 --> 00:42:48,182
[SPEAKER_24]: My clients continue to be concerned about some of the traffic issues posed or traffic numbers posed by BJs.

383
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,924
[SPEAKER_24]: As you know, there's been some back and forth.

384
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:54,027
[SPEAKER_24]: dialogue about that in previous hearings.

385
00:42:54,787 --> 00:42:58,669
[SPEAKER_24]: We continue to have concerns about the data that BJ's is relying on.

386
00:42:59,129 --> 00:43:11,474
[SPEAKER_24]: They've gone out to one particular site to collect some data, which we think is under-representative and not counting enough sites within professional traffic analysis standards.

387
00:43:12,075 --> 00:43:20,298
[SPEAKER_24]: So if the board would be receptive, our traffic consultant, Stephen Elman from Benesch, would be happy to explain very briefly

388
00:43:21,137 --> 00:43:24,318
[SPEAKER_24]: his concerns with those pieces of traffic information.

389
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:31,460
[SPEAKER_24]: So our request is that there be further study from BJ's about data from other locations about traffic impacts.

390
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,661
[SPEAKER_24]: But if Mr. Chair, if you would allow, Steven can offer further information.

391
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:38,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

392
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:39,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Happy to recognize Mr. Ullman.

393
00:43:41,697 --> 00:43:42,858
[SPEAKER_14]: We just got to get you unmuted.

394
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:43,318
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

395
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:44,258
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

396
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:45,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

397
00:43:45,799 --> 00:43:46,899
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Steve Allman.

398
00:43:46,919 --> 00:43:51,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professional traffic engineer with Alfred Burnition Company.

399
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:56,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Our office is in Glastonbury, Connecticut and Boston, Connecticut, the two local offices.

400
00:43:58,885 --> 00:44:01,346
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a registered professional engineer in Massachusetts.

401
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:11,148
[SPEAKER_00]: As Jessica noted that when they redid their analysis and adjusted their trip generation, they used a single site for their analysis.

402
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:22,512
[SPEAKER_00]: The ITE trip generation manual discusses what you should do if you do not match existing land use codes.

403
00:44:23,012 --> 00:44:27,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is no land use code for a wholesale club with gas station,

404
00:44:28,253 --> 00:44:31,337
[SPEAKER_00]: or a wholesale club gas station all by itself.

405
00:44:32,598 --> 00:44:39,305
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I have concerns with this is that BJ sells gasoline off market rate at discounted prices.

406
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:43,109
[SPEAKER_00]: On August 20th, the oil express gasoline

407
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:53,198
[SPEAKER_00]: publication noted that BJ's gasoline sales increased by 4% in the previous quarter, where most gasoline stations lost 10, 15, 20%.

408
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,324
[SPEAKER_00]: The average price for the week of August 17 for the Commonwealth was $2.13 a gallon.

409
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:08,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my understanding someone went to the Norwood site on Saturday the 15th and saw that BJ's was selling approximately $0.30 cheaper.

410
00:45:10,454 --> 00:45:21,716
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the ITE generation manual, if there is no good fit for land use, data should be collected at a minimum of three sites, preferably five.

411
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:32,730
[SPEAKER_00]: BJ's has collected data from one site, and we don't see any reason why they couldn't do at least two more sites count in the area, not four.

412
00:45:33,591 --> 00:45:38,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoneham is not really the same context as the Medford BJ's.

413
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:49,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Stoneham site is located on an isolated roadway far from the main thoroughfare at the end of a dead-end street, while Medford site, as you know, has driveways to two arterial roadways.

414
00:45:50,782 --> 00:46:09,309
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if they didn't want to do counts at actual BJ's, I got to imagine that since BJ's is a member club and they sell their own gas, they should be able to provide the board with, um, sales data for, for several gas stations to get a good feel for the trip generation rates.

415
00:46:10,169 --> 00:46:14,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's really my concern is that they only studied one site.

416
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:16,652
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really representative.

417
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:19,953
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that it justified their data, but.

418
00:46:20,797 --> 00:46:21,958
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hard time with that.

419
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:26,881
[SPEAKER_00]: So just for the board's consideration, and that's all I have.

420
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:28,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Ullman.

421
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:31,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there other members of the public who wish to speak?

422
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:48,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, I will now close the public participation portion of the hearing, and we'll move to deliberation by the board.

423
00:46:52,515 --> 00:47:13,152
[SPEAKER_14]: One question that I have for the proponent is, the comments from the members, the folks who just spoke reminded me, I don't believe that there's going to be signage on Middlesex Avenue that has the gasoline pricing, is that correct?

424
00:47:13,172 --> 00:47:17,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't recall seeing that in,

425
00:47:20,123 --> 00:47:20,963
[SPEAKER_14]: in the design.

426
00:47:20,983 --> 00:47:26,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's like a big BJ sign, but I don't think there's going to be like large gasoline pricing signs.

427
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:29,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I right about that or incorrect?

428
00:47:30,286 --> 00:47:37,607
[SPEAKER_11]: We actually haven't finalized a final sign package, Mr. Chairman, in terms of the signage.

429
00:47:37,687 --> 00:47:43,749
[SPEAKER_11]: But my understanding is that whatever signage would be put on the pylon would be within the

430
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:47,630
[SPEAKER_11]: square footage of that pylon as it exists today.

431
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:53,892
[SPEAKER_11]: I think they may seek to incorporate a reference to the gas, but we're not quite there yet.

432
00:47:53,932 --> 00:48:02,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand that that's a separate permitting process that we would need to go through as part of, you know, any signage that would be out there.

433
00:48:02,855 --> 00:48:03,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

434
00:48:05,936 --> 00:48:06,276
[SPEAKER_14]: I think my

435
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:12,025
[SPEAKER_14]: My recommendation would be to not have the pricing signage out on the street.

436
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:21,809
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that looking at places like Stop and Shop that have an internal gas station, you don't see the pricing signage out on the street.

437
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:36,235
[SPEAKER_14]: So keeping it internal to the site I think makes sense, especially in terms of not having traffic folks going in who aren't members and then can't be serviced and then cycling back unnecessarily out into the street.

438
00:48:36,415 --> 00:48:43,844
[SPEAKER_14]: into Middlesex Ave.

439
00:48:45,166 --> 00:48:49,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Board members, what is your sense in terms of deliberation?

440
00:48:49,772 --> 00:48:52,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further questions or comments you want to make?

441
00:48:53,838 --> 00:49:05,182
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to go back to the traffic, especially since this is one of the main concerns that I had originally about three months ago when we first started with the first hearing for BJ's gas station.

442
00:49:05,883 --> 00:49:10,484
[SPEAKER_12]: And we all established that Middlesex is a very auto-centric area, correct?

443
00:49:10,625 --> 00:49:15,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And that the gas station will most definitely increase and add to the existing conditions.

444
00:49:17,207 --> 00:49:24,432
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually myself had concluded that there was going to be more impact than what had been presented or demonstrated to us.

445
00:49:24,892 --> 00:49:39,621
[SPEAKER_12]: However, in talking through that, one of the things that I noticed at the second hearing, and I thought we were all in agreement with this, although I do not want to negate the public's concern in which Ms.

446
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:44,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Wall is representing, is that the proponent had done so well

447
00:49:45,044 --> 00:50:04,838
[SPEAKER_12]: in in mitigating a lot of the nuances that um not that it would balance it out but I we didn't discuss the traffic a little bit more only because there were so many other nuances that were going to be mitigated so I I don't know how much we need to go back into traffic at this point and now I'm a little concerned only because

448
00:50:05,318 --> 00:50:06,839
[SPEAKER_12]: of all the other work that has been done.

449
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:10,861
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I do not want to negate the public's concern in this.

450
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:23,368
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, if we did go back and use a further study, I'm not sure what the board at this point could do with that information, what recommendations could be made outside of, Andre, what you have already recommended.

451
00:50:23,648 --> 00:50:25,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't put the signage out there to attract more.

452
00:50:28,031 --> 00:50:32,253
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm thinking aloud right now, but at the same time, letting you know my thoughts.

453
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:39,134
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could speak to that through the chair to board member Furtado.

454
00:50:39,154 --> 00:50:40,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Attorney Vaughn.

455
00:50:41,036 --> 00:50:49,545
[SPEAKER_11]: We did actually, I say we, Van Assen associate Sean Kelly did submit to the board back in August a follow-up memorandum.

456
00:50:50,230 --> 00:51:01,880
[SPEAKER_11]: regarding the traffic and responded to comments that were brought up by the board as well as the folks at Benesh relative to council.

457
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,764
[SPEAKER_11]: We feel that everything that's been submitted has been done pursuant to industry requirements standards.

458
00:51:06,985 --> 00:51:13,490
[SPEAKER_11]: We did go out and look at another site and it gave us comfort that our numbers were appropriate.

459
00:51:14,882 --> 00:51:23,386
[SPEAKER_11]: And we feel very confident that the traffic has been evaluated and assessed appropriately as it relates to this.

460
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:36,033
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just wanted to make sure that everyone understood we did submit a follow-up memo that I know was circulated to Todd Blake as well, relative to the traffic analysis.

461
00:51:37,573 --> 00:51:37,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

462
00:51:38,634 --> 00:51:38,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

463
00:51:39,745 --> 00:51:49,833
[SPEAKER_12]: And Ajay, in speaking to that, I guess would this be the proper time to have Mr. Blake speak to that submission from August, in which perhaps Ms.

464
00:51:49,853 --> 00:51:50,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Wall is not aware of?

465
00:51:52,536 --> 00:51:56,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you'd like Engineer Blake to comment on that, we can invite him to do that.

466
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Blake.

467
00:52:01,523 --> 00:52:01,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

468
00:52:01,803 --> 00:52:03,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chairman.

469
00:52:05,226 --> 00:52:07,148
[SPEAKER_04]: When I look at these sort of things, I'm trying to

470
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,871
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, explain the situation to the residents and the board from my perspective.

471
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:21,433
[SPEAKER_04]: I think both sides of the conversation have good points, and particularly Mr. Ullman's comments about empirical data versus IT data.

472
00:52:21,493 --> 00:52:23,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do empirical, three sites recommend it.

473
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:26,774
[SPEAKER_04]: As a private consultant, I've done that in the past myself.

474
00:52:27,134 --> 00:52:28,514
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the better way to do it.

475
00:52:28,994 --> 00:52:32,215
[SPEAKER_04]: But I usually try to cut to the chase with this sort of thing.

476
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:38,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I truly don't believe that you would get both sides ever to agree on an exact number.

477
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So I try to take that into account.

478
00:52:42,601 --> 00:52:44,982
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's varying degrees, obviously, for the community.

479
00:52:45,522 --> 00:52:48,702
[SPEAKER_04]: If 100 cars are added versus 1,000, that's a difference, or 500.

480
00:52:49,523 --> 00:52:56,784
[SPEAKER_04]: So ultimately, both sides present their best estimates of projections and their points of view.

481
00:52:57,464 --> 00:52:59,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And we try to mitigate it.

482
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:04,204
[SPEAKER_04]: where I try to suggest a mitigation package that might mitigate some of those concerns.

483
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:06,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the board obviously makes the decision.

484
00:53:06,505 --> 00:53:09,286
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's definitely some gray area.

485
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:15,828
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, in terms of ever getting an agreement of a particular number, I don't necessarily see that happening.

486
00:53:16,388 --> 00:53:20,689
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm trying to just give you guys my perspective.

487
00:53:21,069 --> 00:53:29,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think by, so if someone came up with a higher number, what you would do is maybe add more mitigation to help address that higher number.

488
00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:41,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So the approach that we took was recommending mitigation from complete street standpoint that hopefully balances out the mode split to address it that way.

489
00:53:41,707 --> 00:53:47,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Another approach could be to add capacity to allow for those additional cars.

490
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:55,577
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no exact science here and it's really up to the board knowing all that information, exactly how much,

491
00:53:56,334 --> 00:54:00,218
[SPEAKER_04]: you think is reasonable in which approach you want to go.

492
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:12,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're tasked with reviewing things from a complete streets perspective, but I also get the traditional way of adding capacity and improving levels of service and things like that.

493
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:12,770
[SPEAKER_04]: So

494
00:54:14,708 --> 00:54:15,209
[SPEAKER_04]: if that helps.

495
00:54:15,729 --> 00:54:16,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. Blake.

496
00:54:16,971 --> 00:54:20,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Personally, I feel comfortable with the mitigation that we've accomplished here.

497
00:54:20,395 --> 00:54:28,104
[SPEAKER_14]: My priority has really been around safety, and I think the investments that we're seeing here will improve the safety of that intersection.

498
00:54:31,432 --> 00:54:32,953
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say that I echo that.

499
00:54:33,693 --> 00:54:42,118
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm all for the complete streets elements that are being done as opposed to addressing safety, as opposed to adding capacity.

500
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:50,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Because as a planner myself, and this is nothing against all the information done by IT, as well as the great work of traffic engineers.

501
00:54:50,622 --> 00:54:55,705
[SPEAKER_12]: But to me, you widen a street to accommodate more traffic, guess what happens?

502
00:54:55,785 --> 00:54:56,486
[SPEAKER_12]: More cars come.

503
00:54:58,947 --> 00:55:05,630
[SPEAKER_12]: really good with the mitigation that we have already done, or that has been expressed by the proponent.

504
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:14,395
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to review the the letters that have been submitted by the city's department heads.

505
00:55:14,535 --> 00:55:18,597
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a letter from Timothy McGivern, the city engineer,

506
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:23,266
[SPEAKER_14]: in an updated letter to the board that was dated August 18th, 2020.

507
00:55:23,406 --> 00:55:32,229
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Mr. Blake's updated comments that he mentioned a few things which we may or may not want to take action on.

508
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:41,813
[SPEAKER_14]: The fire chief's June 16th letter, the Brian Cairns Commissioner of Public Works letter from June 16th,

509
00:55:43,013 --> 00:55:47,637
[SPEAKER_14]: and Paul Moki, the building commissioner, his letter from March 6th.

510
00:55:47,797 --> 00:56:05,010
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to ask the proponent whether the items that were in those letters from city departments, have they, in your opinion, all been addressed or are you able to address them in the course of the project as possible conditions for moving forward?

511
00:56:07,362 --> 00:56:09,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, if I could, Mr. Chairman, Attorney Mark Vaughn.

512
00:56:09,264 --> 00:56:12,868
[SPEAKER_11]: We are familiar with those comment letters.

513
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:15,571
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that Annie was kind enough to send them all.

514
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:19,676
[SPEAKER_11]: We got them all individually, of course, before, but we saw them today.

515
00:56:19,696 --> 00:56:20,737
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that we have

516
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:31,710
[SPEAKER_11]: either modify the plan to address them, or I know that Austin has responded to some of the more technical engineering comments and how the plan can address those.

517
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:39,680
[SPEAKER_11]: But Austin, please jump in if you feel like anything needs to be expanded upon as it relates to that, particularly DPW or engineering.

518
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:48,642
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I think as we've mentioned before, we're comfortable with the comments that the engineering department had provided with respect to some of the onsite improvements.

519
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:50,663
[SPEAKER_06]: We've addressed those comments.

520
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:58,486
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some that were construction related when the project transitions out of the entitlement phase into construction, and we're comfortable accommodating those requests as well.

521
00:56:58,506 --> 00:57:03,107
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not unusual or different from most other projects, so we're quite comfortable there.

522
00:57:04,143 --> 00:57:04,724
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you.

523
00:57:04,744 --> 00:57:10,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So as we approach a vote, the conditions that would be...

524
00:57:11,672 --> 00:57:15,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, part of the vote would be the what's included in the letters.

525
00:57:16,074 --> 00:57:17,575
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there are a few loose ends.

526
00:57:17,595 --> 00:57:24,759
[SPEAKER_14]: We as a board just need to, uh, finalize particularly the things that engineer Blake raised this evening.

527
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:36,646
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the pedestrian signage so that folks don't walk in the automobile entrance is, uh, it should be an easy one that we would want to include.

528
00:57:37,546 --> 00:57:40,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I think we've heard that there's

529
00:57:42,142 --> 00:57:53,467
[SPEAKER_14]: some, there may be some desire on the part of neighborhood residents to improve access from Woodruff Ave, but we are not sure.

530
00:57:53,627 --> 00:58:05,653
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would say that we would leave that up to the city to pursue with the neighbors and BJs in the future and would not make that a condition.

531
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:09,995
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we've also heard just the difficulty of

532
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:22,819
[SPEAKER_14]: creating a good pedestrian access from the rear of the loading area of the site, which I would also be willing to not include as a condition at this time.

533
00:58:22,839 --> 00:58:28,844
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't wanna necessarily encourage people to use that entrance.

534
00:58:31,286 --> 00:58:35,029
[SPEAKER_14]: Board members, what are your thoughts about those matters or others?

535
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:48,847
[SPEAKER_21]: The more I think about it, I would definitely ask that at minimum, the edge, I forgot the name of the street now.

536
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:50,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Woodruff?

537
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:53,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Woodruff, yeah.

538
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,172
[SPEAKER_21]: Be addressed.

539
00:58:59,214 --> 00:59:04,978
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know exactly how to put that in the wording here, Andre, but

540
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:25,319
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I think one of the big themes that we've seen that has sort of come forward in this review of this project is that I think everybody's asking for BJs to be a better neighbor.

541
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:36,327
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, it's hard for me to get behind this when there's something so glaring.

542
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:55,798
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we're dealing with real data and things on a lot of this, but the fact is we're adding a gas station, which is something that in a residential neighborhood could easily be seen as detrimental.

543
00:59:56,279 --> 01:00:03,603
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think they need to do everything they can to counter that.

544
01:00:03,723 --> 01:00:09,467
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think they have a great opportunity to do that in that woodruff edge, which I didn't realize was so degraded.

545
01:00:11,628 --> 01:00:19,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I think there's a number of questions that have been raised around that discussion that we wouldn't be able to resolve tonight, or maybe not even in the near future.

546
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:27,551
[SPEAKER_14]: So plus, I would be more inclined to ask the city to follow up.

547
01:00:27,651 --> 01:00:38,213
[SPEAKER_14]: And Engineer Blake, how would you feel about having a follow-up meeting with BJs and neighborhood residents

548
01:00:40,231 --> 01:00:55,054
[SPEAKER_18]: I would also like to add that that's a suggestion that we've heard like from Chris and from Todd, but I don't feel like we've heard from residents that they want an additional connection at all.

549
01:00:55,594 --> 01:00:58,655
[SPEAKER_18]: And I agree that there are both sides to that.

550
01:00:59,075 --> 01:01:03,536
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm neutral on the connection, but I'm more interested in the edge.

551
01:01:09,293 --> 01:01:10,294
[SPEAKER_18]: The greening of the edge.

552
01:01:10,374 --> 01:01:18,899
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I think that there could be some work for us to clarify with BJ's exactly where the property line is.

553
01:01:18,919 --> 01:01:26,824
[SPEAKER_18]: And if we find that the property line is such that there is vegetated or

554
01:01:27,825 --> 01:01:31,726
[SPEAKER_18]: could be vegetated area along there that is city owned.

555
01:01:31,906 --> 01:01:35,067
[SPEAKER_18]: We can ask DPW to get some attention over there.

556
01:01:35,087 --> 01:01:46,451
[SPEAKER_18]: And if the property, if that's actually all of that from the pavement towards BJ's is their property, then the city shouldn't be doing it.

557
01:01:46,651 --> 01:01:48,852
[SPEAKER_18]: And we would have to ask BJ's to keep it.

558
01:01:49,712 --> 01:01:50,972
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm all for that.

559
01:01:51,052 --> 01:01:52,573
[SPEAKER_21]: And then the last piece is the fence.

560
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:55,474
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm going to repeat my comment that that fence

561
01:01:56,368 --> 01:01:59,369
[SPEAKER_21]: plastic slats in a fence is ugly, and I think they could do better.

562
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, if I may?

563
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Engineer Blake.

564
01:02:04,772 --> 01:02:05,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, three points.

565
01:02:05,832 --> 01:02:15,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fence looks like a no-brainer because it's likely the fence is constructed exactly on the property line because otherwise the fence would be further out.

566
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:25,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it was further into the area that's kind of in the street right-of-way, then there may be an opportunity to do the walkway that we spoke of.

567
01:02:26,372 --> 01:02:27,452
[SPEAKER_04]: landscaping either or.

568
01:02:28,153 --> 01:02:45,120
[SPEAKER_04]: So the other thing is I don't have the public private street list in front of me, but it's 39% private streets in Medford, so I wouldn't necessarily wanna completely solidify what the city can and can't do there if it's one of the private streets.

569
01:02:46,341 --> 01:02:53,824
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of connections, that's why I had a big asterisk in my recommendations because some communities don't wanna be connected, so I don't wanna speak for them.

570
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think in one of the previous meetings,

571
01:02:56,747 --> 01:03:01,489
[SPEAKER_04]: there were folks that may have spoke against the connection when Councilor Marks attended.

572
01:03:02,369 --> 01:03:05,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when we talked about the break in the fence further down.

573
01:03:06,191 --> 01:03:22,078
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one last point in terms of if the connection isn't desirable, and if there's not much you could do internally to the pedestrian connection from the Fellsway side, and these outstanding traffic issues are still in some people's mind, you could consider

574
01:03:22,993 --> 01:03:28,555
[SPEAKER_04]: additional things that improve pedestrian safety or awareness on the Fellsway side.

575
01:03:29,036 --> 01:03:42,902
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, there's two unsignalized crosswalks crossing Fellsway West, second and Myrtle, that could use enhanced signage like flashing signs or pedestrian button, RFB style.

576
01:03:43,422 --> 01:03:47,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but those would be subject to DCR, just something to consider.

577
01:03:48,964 --> 01:03:53,828
[SPEAKER_14]: So Engineer Blake, I didn't totally understand what you were saying about the fence.

578
01:03:53,968 --> 01:03:55,029
[SPEAKER_14]: What was your position on that?

579
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:08,340
[SPEAKER_04]: The fence, it seems like a low hanging fruit because it's on their property and it does, as the other members pointed out, that particular stretch does have, it's lacking screening.

580
01:04:09,061 --> 01:04:13,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't necessarily seem like you're tied to a chain link fence with slats.

581
01:04:13,605 --> 01:04:16,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you could do one of these really nice

582
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:22,019
[SPEAKER_04]: stained wooden fences that a lot of residential areas have if you can't fit landscaping.

583
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:24,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know, there's other options, I think.

584
01:04:25,220 --> 01:04:43,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Chair, if you don't mind, just as something for further consideration of the board, I mean, perhaps a condition of a presumptive approval would be that the applicant continue to work with the team at the community development department, as well as the engineering staff to see if there are additional opportunities to further enhance the screening between the property and Woodroof Avenue.

585
01:04:44,432 --> 01:04:52,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And to the extent that you empower the team at the community development and engineering departments, it would be amenable to working with them.

586
01:04:54,293 --> 01:04:54,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

587
01:04:54,674 --> 01:04:55,995
[SPEAKER_14]: That seems reasonable to me.

588
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:08,449
[SPEAKER_18]: I have actually one other thing that I feel like I should bring up, and that is the new sidewalk that you're adding.

589
01:05:08,469 --> 01:05:10,131
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that

590
01:05:12,914 --> 01:05:17,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Turner and others may be aware that there's some drainage.

591
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:32,976
[SPEAKER_18]: So the portion that's not actually part of this plan that's connecting all the way to the club, that there is some additional drainage treatment that's going to need to occur down there, where the parking lot currently drains straight into

592
01:05:33,757 --> 01:05:34,477
[SPEAKER_18]: the wetland.

593
01:05:35,758 --> 01:05:45,622
[SPEAKER_18]: You'll have to address that with MassDEP because of the whole, it won't go back to the CONCOMM because of the appeal and the superseding order of conditions.

594
01:05:46,562 --> 01:05:53,645
[SPEAKER_18]: But you'll need to make sure that that sidewalk change and all that DEP is comfortable with that.

595
01:05:55,053 --> 01:05:56,494
[SPEAKER_18]: and how you treat the water.

596
01:05:56,854 --> 01:05:59,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, the water runs straight out of the parking lot into the wetland.

597
01:06:00,477 --> 01:06:06,900
[SPEAKER_18]: If you put sidewalks straight across it, you know, with your regular curb, the water's gonna pool up in your parking lot.

598
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:09,242
[SPEAKER_18]: It's gonna be a problem operationally for the club.

599
01:06:09,262 --> 01:06:11,703
[SPEAKER_18]: So you'll need to look at that.

600
01:06:11,863 --> 01:06:21,289
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know we looked at it on site so that this is not like stunning, but just to acknowledge that something will have to be dealt with down there.

601
01:06:22,073 --> 01:06:22,813
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's a good point.

602
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:23,194
[SPEAKER_06]: We shouldn't.

603
01:06:23,214 --> 01:06:24,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for bringing that back up.

604
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:26,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are working with PJ says that comes together.

605
01:06:26,795 --> 01:06:29,976
[SPEAKER_06]: He would point that out and identified as an operational concern.

606
01:06:30,036 --> 01:06:37,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're gonna We're like as part of the sidewalk improvements on how to make sure the drainage is water slowing downhill, so to speak, and isn't, um

607
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,260
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't causing any issues in that regard.

608
01:06:41,421 --> 01:06:44,101
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't think that the board needs to address this.

609
01:06:44,161 --> 01:07:03,884
[SPEAKER_18]: I just sort of wanted to say in a public venue that that'll need to go to MassDEP because of the open, normally it would go back to what the Conservation Commission will look at, but because if there's a superseding order of conditions there or there is one coming, sorry that my brain has just stopped to where that stands.

610
01:07:05,445 --> 01:07:06,925
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll be the ones that need to

611
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:08,820
[SPEAKER_18]: to approve that.

612
01:07:10,461 --> 01:07:11,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, if I may.

613
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:13,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Engineer Blake.

614
01:07:13,842 --> 01:07:15,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the sidewalk, I'm not familiar.

615
01:07:15,543 --> 01:07:19,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the runoff from the landscaped area or from the parking lot?

616
01:07:19,605 --> 01:07:23,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it- This isn't by Middlesex.

617
01:07:23,686 --> 01:07:27,308
[SPEAKER_18]: This is really in their parking lot, very close to the building.

618
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:37,572
[SPEAKER_18]: So much, it's outside of the gas station area all the way down near the- Delivery driveway?

619
01:07:38,151 --> 01:07:39,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's near that.

620
01:07:39,872 --> 01:07:45,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an operational maintenance item related to the stormwater that we're going to be improving as part of the sidewalk construction.

621
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:45,855
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

622
01:07:46,215 --> 01:07:51,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's that's what my point was going to be in the in the effort to reconstruct or add that sidewalk.

623
01:07:52,518 --> 01:08:05,105
[SPEAKER_04]: There are opportunities with the type of curb chosen, whether it's Petunias Berm, Granite Curb, and also with catch basins and other drainage elements, you could improve that area, at least within the extent of where the sidewalks being at.

624
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:09,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

625
01:08:12,475 --> 01:08:17,778
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we've heard there are conditions from the letters of the department heads that are amenable to the proponent.

626
01:08:18,278 --> 01:08:21,159
[SPEAKER_14]: There is the pedestrian signage.

627
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:32,926
[SPEAKER_14]: There is the follow-up with the proponent and the Office of Community Development and the city engineer's office about the screening issue.

628
01:08:34,106 --> 01:08:37,468
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think

629
01:08:38,283 --> 01:08:41,984
[SPEAKER_14]: That is it in terms of outstanding conditions.

630
01:08:42,004 --> 01:08:44,604
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm missing anything, any.

631
01:08:48,905 --> 01:08:49,506
[SPEAKER_16]: Andre, Dave.

632
01:08:50,466 --> 01:08:52,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, David.

633
01:08:52,986 --> 01:09:04,009
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure on your conditions what the final word was on closing the gap on the bicycle, the Sheros and so forth from 5th to 9th.

634
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:06,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you for reminding me of that.

635
01:09:07,288 --> 01:09:08,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's a good question.

636
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:29,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we've heard that they're open to exploring it, but I think we should include it in a list of conditions subject to the approval of the state on that.

637
01:09:31,121 --> 01:09:33,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Attorney Vaughn, would you have any problem with that?

638
01:09:38,495 --> 01:09:40,995
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't, but I'm not the one writing the checks, I guess, for everything.

639
01:09:41,055 --> 01:09:47,197
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll speak, but if Patrick wants to jump in and correct me on it.

640
01:09:47,237 --> 01:09:55,639
[SPEAKER_11]: But obviously, I think if you look at everything that we're doing mitigation-wise off-site, there's a significant number here in terms of trying to

641
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:01,302
[SPEAKER_11]: address the totality of the items that have been raised by board members.

642
01:10:02,183 --> 01:10:16,095
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know that would be some additional funding, but Patrick or Sean, I don't know if you're comfortable with that, but please jump in.

643
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:19,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Patrick has to be unmuted, Annie, if you don't mind.

644
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:22,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

645
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:27,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Annie.

646
01:10:27,192 --> 01:10:27,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

647
01:10:27,912 --> 01:10:31,554
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Chair, we're happy to commit to the sharrows from 5th to 9th.

648
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:33,475
[SPEAKER_10]: We will agree to that as a condition.

649
01:10:35,456 --> 01:10:39,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we were told it was the gap also from the 1st to 5th.

650
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:40,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

651
01:10:40,879 --> 01:10:41,360
[SPEAKER_12]: 5th to 9th.

652
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, it's 5th to 9th as the gap.

653
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:45,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I was confused on which was the gap there.

654
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:46,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

655
01:10:46,303 --> 01:10:49,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there are bike lanes to 1st and then sharrows from 1st to 5th.

656
01:10:50,005 --> 01:10:51,666
[SPEAKER_04]: So 5th to 9th was the gap.

657
01:10:52,066 --> 01:10:52,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Got it.

658
01:10:52,486 --> 01:10:52,806
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

659
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:53,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

660
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:55,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, and thank you, Mr. Netriba, then.

661
01:10:56,328 --> 01:10:57,048
[SPEAKER_14]: appreciate that.

662
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:01,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

663
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:15,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there and then the other thing that I brought up was just in terms of conditions was not to not to have the

664
01:11:19,028 --> 01:11:28,574
[SPEAKER_14]: the gas pricing numbers as part of the signage on Middlesex Avenue, but have it keep that interior to the site.

665
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:32,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that something that you'd be willing to consider?

666
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:37,520
[SPEAKER_11]: I would respectfully ask if the board would consider not making that a condition.

667
01:11:38,381 --> 01:11:42,824
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we heard your desire, but I don't think that we want to

668
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:48,064
[SPEAKER_11]: hamstring the operation.

669
01:11:48,364 --> 01:11:59,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't know enough as to what they would, you know, typically want to see or, you know, signs evolve over time to, you know, you may have signage there initially that, you know, they may want to change, but

670
01:12:01,668 --> 01:12:05,170
[SPEAKER_11]: Patrick, I don't think that we're looking to increase the size of the signage.

671
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:08,871
[SPEAKER_11]: That pylon that's out there would be within the same square footage.

672
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:15,773
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess that's what my preference would be, Mr. Chairman, if it would not be a condition.

673
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:19,375
[SPEAKER_11]: But obviously, we have to go through a separate approval process for any signage.

674
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I echo what Mark said, Mr. Chair.

675
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:29,753
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like to handle that outside of this, via the proper mechanisms that the city has set forth.

676
01:12:30,354 --> 01:12:37,156
[SPEAKER_10]: But as an aside, we just seek parity in terms of our competition and the folks that we do business against.

677
01:12:37,276 --> 01:12:41,258
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, our neighbor across the street has an LED sign.

678
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:45,140
[SPEAKER_10]: And for us not to have that as well, could you approve our application?

679
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:46,560
[SPEAKER_10]: Not to be presumptive, of course, sir.

680
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It would seem fair that we would have that ability to do so as well.

681
01:12:50,942 --> 01:12:54,184
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have to advertise our pricing to the public.

682
01:12:54,484 --> 01:13:02,010
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a state law, and I couldn't quote you chapter and verse on that, but we certainly wanna preserve that ability in the future, sir.

683
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll leave it at that.

684
01:13:03,831 --> 01:13:15,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, well, I'm just offering it as some feedback, understanding that that's a separate issue that's outside our scope is approval of the signage will be with the city council.

685
01:13:16,679 --> 01:13:17,280
[SPEAKER_10]: And we understand that.

686
01:13:20,082 --> 01:13:20,423
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

687
01:13:21,304 --> 01:13:24,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor from the board?

688
01:13:24,027 --> 01:13:35,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I can help you make the motion.

689
01:13:36,442 --> 01:13:37,764
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got to come from the board members.

690
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:49,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you reiterate the conditions and or the recommendations in which the board is deliberating on?

691
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:50,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Andre?

692
01:13:50,631 --> 01:14:01,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so the conditions, should you want to move to approve the project with conditions, the conditions would include

693
01:14:03,949 --> 01:14:12,251
[SPEAKER_14]: all the items that are in the letters from the city department heads, and there's a whole kind of list of those letters, which the proponent has agreed to.

694
01:14:13,252 --> 01:14:26,896
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there would be the pedestrian signage and the follow up with the office of community development about the,

695
01:14:28,542 --> 01:14:34,866
[SPEAKER_14]: further improvements to screening and access along Woodruff Avenue.

696
01:14:37,768 --> 01:14:43,031
[SPEAKER_14]: And the sharrows, of course, to fill in the gap with the bike lanes.

697
01:14:44,412 --> 01:14:49,555
[SPEAKER_12]: So the proponent has agreed to the sharrows, but I was a little confused on the wayfinding.

698
01:14:50,036 --> 01:14:53,858
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we making that a condition for approval?

699
01:14:53,878 --> 01:14:56,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the wayfinding should be?

700
01:14:58,196 --> 01:15:05,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I think we're just talking about a small signage that would tell people where the sidewalk is to access the site.

701
01:15:20,309 --> 01:15:24,471
[SPEAKER_23]: Andre, are you looking for a motion on the project with those conditions?

702
01:15:24,912 --> 01:15:25,092
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

703
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:36,154
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll make a motion that we move ahead with the project with the conditions listed.

704
01:15:36,174 --> 01:15:46,598
[SPEAKER_23]: The conditions being all the conditions from the department heads as listed in their letters, the pedestrian signage, and the follow-up with the Office of Community Development regarding Woodroof Avenue.

705
01:15:47,732 --> 01:15:58,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and just let me get Annie and Alicia here to make sure I'm doing this correctly, since we are the Special Permit Granting Authority, as well as the Site Plan Review, maybe we have to take two separate votes, is that correct?

706
01:15:59,784 --> 01:16:03,028
[SPEAKER_20]: It's one vote Special Permit for Site Plan Review.

707
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:04,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

708
01:16:04,669 --> 01:16:08,293
[SPEAKER_20]: If you can just add that to the motion, approve the Special Permit for Site Plan Review.

709
01:16:09,418 --> 01:16:12,660
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Chairman, just a point of information before you.

710
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:17,623
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to be on the off-site items that we're talking about on Middlesex Avenue.

711
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:23,227
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you had indicated this before, but obviously that would all be subject to final mass DOT approval.

712
01:16:23,327 --> 01:16:32,532
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, we're comfortable constructing and paying for it, but it's subject to DOT approval for those items.

713
01:16:32,552 --> 01:16:32,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

714
01:16:33,293 --> 01:16:33,633
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

715
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:37,595
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mr. Chair, I'm sorry to interrupt.

716
01:16:38,883 --> 01:16:39,823
[SPEAKER_04]: important note.

717
01:16:42,024 --> 01:16:46,246
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's in regard it's in regard to saying conditions from the department has letters.

718
01:16:47,047 --> 01:16:59,733
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the letter from engineering there's several civil engineering items as well as the traffic and in that traffic original letter it talks about the walkway from Middlesex to the building and also the Fellsway West to the building.

719
01:17:00,433 --> 01:17:04,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to avoid some confusion in the confusion in the future about

720
01:17:05,168 --> 01:17:08,910
[SPEAKER_04]: what the actual conditions are, because we've had issues with that in the past.

721
01:17:10,671 --> 01:17:21,377
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually, so in this case, it would be the letter, but excluding some of them because they did not necessarily add that walkway from Fells Way West.

722
01:17:21,397 --> 01:17:22,598
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one example.

723
01:17:23,278 --> 01:17:27,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you just include the letter as a whole, it will be contradictory to that.

724
01:17:29,982 --> 01:17:30,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

725
01:17:32,177 --> 01:17:34,178
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's try it.

726
01:17:34,698 --> 01:17:34,958
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

727
01:17:34,998 --> 01:17:44,603
[SPEAKER_18]: We could say the department had letters and the engineering letter as discussed during this meeting.

728
01:17:45,283 --> 01:17:54,007
[SPEAKER_18]: And Ali has been taking notes, and Ali and Annie can review the video and making sure that the ones that they verbally agreed to are the ones that are in it.

729
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:57,029
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also very easy for a project this complicated.

730
01:17:57,089 --> 01:18:04,034
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're happy to send, we always send the letter, the approval with the conditions to Andre for review.

731
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:11,078
[SPEAKER_18]: We could send them to the applicant as well and make sure that they heard the same thing we heard.

732
01:18:11,178 --> 01:18:16,362
[SPEAKER_18]: And if there's any disagreement, we have a video so we can review the video.

733
01:18:17,342 --> 01:18:18,763
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be very helpful, Lisa.

734
01:18:18,783 --> 01:18:19,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

735
01:18:20,965 --> 01:18:21,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

736
01:18:23,808 --> 01:18:46,529
[SPEAKER_14]: So the motion on the floor would be whether or not to approve the special permit with site plan review for the application for the gas station at the BJ site with conditions, including the letters from city department heads, and we will enumerate those with

737
01:18:47,392 --> 01:19:07,665
[SPEAKER_14]: excluding the pedestrian access from the Fellsway West, and including additionally pedestrian signage to the site.

738
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:14,909
[SPEAKER_14]: The bike lanes from 5th to 9th

739
01:19:17,778 --> 01:19:43,173
[SPEAKER_14]: and the, I feel like I'm missing one here, and the follow-up meeting with the Office of Community Development and the proponent and the city engineer regarding any further improvements along the Woodruff line.

740
01:19:47,306 --> 01:19:50,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Does that sound like we've captured everything?

741
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:55,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

742
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:56,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

743
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:58,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie, would you like to so move?

744
01:20:00,612 --> 01:20:01,433
[SPEAKER_23]: Should I repeat that?

745
01:20:02,133 --> 01:20:02,313
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

746
01:20:02,873 --> 01:20:03,153
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

747
01:20:03,714 --> 01:20:04,354
[SPEAKER_23]: I so move.

748
01:20:05,615 --> 01:20:05,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

749
01:20:05,955 --> 01:20:06,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

750
01:20:06,815 --> 01:20:07,375
[SPEAKER_12]: I second.

751
01:20:08,716 --> 01:20:09,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jackie.

752
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:10,357
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

753
01:20:10,377 --> 01:20:12,738
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just go to a roll call vote.

754
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:13,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh.

755
01:20:14,559 --> 01:20:14,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

759
01:20:20,986 --> 01:20:21,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaas Andreassen.

760
01:20:21,906 --> 01:20:23,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Abstain.

761
01:20:25,427 --> 01:20:26,768
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, that was same?

762
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:28,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Abstain.

763
01:20:28,468 --> 01:20:28,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Abstain.

764
01:20:30,369 --> 01:20:31,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd.

765
01:20:33,129 --> 01:20:34,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, she's off, that's right.

766
01:20:34,450 --> 01:20:35,430
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jackie Furtado.

767
01:20:35,870 --> 01:20:35,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

768
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:38,831
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am an aye as well.

769
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:44,693
[SPEAKER_14]: So I believe that is one, two, three, four.

770
01:20:45,923 --> 01:20:51,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Five in favor, one abstention, one recused.

771
01:20:52,228 --> 01:20:53,769
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the motion passes.

772
01:20:58,692 --> 01:20:59,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

773
01:20:59,453 --> 01:21:01,854
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you, Mr. Netriba and your team.

774
01:21:01,874 --> 01:21:07,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate all of the discussion and work and mitigation that went into this.

775
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you all very much.

776
01:21:10,981 --> 01:21:11,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good evening.

777
01:21:12,002 --> 01:21:12,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, you too.

778
01:21:23,318 --> 01:21:28,204
[SPEAKER_14]: The next item on the agenda is a public hearing for a brewery ordinance.

779
01:21:29,446 --> 01:21:33,191
[SPEAKER_14]: The community development board will be making a recommendation to the city council.

780
01:21:35,334 --> 01:21:38,158

01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:25,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Andre, it just came to my attention, I just wanted to make a full disclosure on something, just to make sure that it's not a problem later.

790
01:23:25,935 --> 01:23:39,503
[SPEAKER_12]: My eldest daughter just mentioned, she says, hey mom, I hear that you're going to be listening to a case from my 11th grade teacher, Max Hennig, and he was her 11th grade teacher.

791
01:23:40,023 --> 01:23:51,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Circa 2010, I have no special interest or financial gain in this project, but I did want to disclose that apparently this is a discussion that amongst their class right now.

792
01:23:51,731 --> 01:23:54,373
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but I wanted to put that on record.

793
01:23:54,993 --> 01:23:55,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

794
01:23:58,936 --> 01:24:00,076

796
01:24:02,638 --> 01:24:03,018
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

797
01:24:03,599 --> 01:24:03,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

798
01:24:04,563 --> 01:24:09,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe that rises to the level of a conflict, so I think you're good.

799
01:24:10,843 --> 01:24:11,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead, Mr. Bloomberg.

800
01:24:13,466 --> 01:24:34,524
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to share with the group that when I saw the materials on Friday and then reviewed them on Sunday, it came to my attention that this draft ordinance is somehow connected with a company in which my family has financial interest, although de minimis, and one that was obtained well in advance of my participation with the board.

801
01:24:35,838 --> 01:24:41,843
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like for that reason that I should recuse myself from the discussions tonight into liberation.

802
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:52,230
[SPEAKER_16]: So if that's acceptable to you, Andre and to the board, I'll go ahead and mute myself and drop off the screen for this item.

803
01:24:53,151 --> 01:24:53,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

804
01:24:53,551 --> 01:24:55,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, member Bloomberg.

805
01:24:56,773 --> 01:24:57,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate that.

806
01:24:58,755 --> 01:24:59,355
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry about that.

807
01:24:59,836 --> 01:25:00,336
[SPEAKER_14]: It's okay.

808
01:25:00,776 --> 01:25:02,618
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate everybody's

809
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:08,713
[SPEAKER_14]: have good habits on this.

810
01:25:09,014 --> 01:25:24,434
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me just finish on the public hearing notice that folks who want to participate can, let me just say this one more time.

811
01:25:26,682 --> 01:25:40,354
[SPEAKER_14]: So to participate during the hearing, questions and comments may be emailed to OCD at Medford-MA.gov or submitted via phone to 781-393-2480.

812
01:25:40,434 --> 01:25:42,375
[SPEAKER_14]: That's 781-393-2480.

813
01:25:42,395 --> 01:25:46,159
[SPEAKER_14]: All votes will be roll call votes.

814
01:25:46,359 --> 01:25:50,142
[SPEAKER_14]: And please, if you speak, please introduce yourself.

815
01:25:50,402 --> 01:25:53,785
[SPEAKER_14]: And members of the public will need your name and address for the record.

816
01:25:56,142 --> 01:26:03,386
[SPEAKER_18]: Andre, I feel like we should just also mention, it makes it sound like if people are connected to this, that they have to send an email or call a phone number.

817
01:26:03,466 --> 01:26:15,393
[SPEAKER_18]: If you are in the Zoom call, you may use the raise hand function in the members list, and we can call on you during the public hearing portion of the meeting.

818
01:26:15,633 --> 01:26:18,314
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't have to call the phone number if you're on the Zoom call.

819
01:26:18,915 --> 01:26:19,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

820
01:26:19,255 --> 01:26:19,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

821
01:26:19,715 --> 01:26:22,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good clarification, Alicia.

822
01:26:27,733 --> 01:26:37,537
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so let me invite Paul Moki, the city of Medford's building commissioner, to speak to the draft ordinance.

823
01:26:41,499 --> 01:26:48,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that, or do we have, Annie, is that who we should have go first, or is there a proponent that should go before that?

824
01:26:48,742 --> 01:26:52,784
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Paul, thank you, Mr. Moki.

825
01:26:52,804 --> 01:26:55,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good evening, everybody, thank you.

826
01:26:57,068 --> 01:27:16,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So on this, looking at this proposed draft, I noticed in the, would you like me to just comment on it, Andre, or do you want to go over some of the- Well, if you don't mind explaining it so that members of the public who might not be familiar with it can understand what it is exactly, what it does.

827
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:25,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so right now, in the zoning ordinance, there's no specific definition that allows any type of brewery use.

828
01:27:26,137 --> 01:27:37,227
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did when we, going back to last year, and we started drafting this proposed ordinance, we looked at what some of the other cities and towns were doing and how they were classifying them.

829
01:27:37,407 --> 01:27:40,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seemed to be one of three things.

830
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:50,379
[SPEAKER_03]: One, either they had a line item in the zoning table that did allow a specific brewery use, or they listed it as light manufacturing use.

831
01:27:50,699 --> 01:27:51,580
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have any.

832
01:27:52,526 --> 01:27:55,807
[SPEAKER_03]: light manufacturing use defined in our zoning ordinance.

833
01:27:55,847 --> 01:28:02,868
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have general manufacturing, but that's really what you consider as, you know, factory, typical factory use.

834
01:28:02,888 --> 01:28:04,449
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing that would allow brewery.

835
01:28:05,269 --> 01:28:11,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that they were doing was they, some cities and towns were classifying as a restaurant.

836
01:28:11,290 --> 01:28:18,652
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, it needs the state license, local pouring license and things like that, no matter what classification is going on.

837
01:28:19,232 --> 01:28:19,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tried to,

838
01:28:20,734 --> 01:28:25,375
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, combine what we thought kind of like the best of both worlds for breweries.

839
01:28:25,475 --> 01:28:29,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now the definition is defined in the proposal.

840
01:28:30,896 --> 01:28:47,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Brewery is defined as an establishment primarily engaged in production and distribution of beer, ale, or other malt beverages, which may include accessory uses such as tours of the brewery, retail sales, and on-site consumption of the products.

841
01:28:48,521 --> 01:28:50,581
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, a tap room or a tasting room.

842
01:28:52,168 --> 01:29:02,271
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we just mentioned, the facilities should hold the appropriate Commonwealth of Massachusetts brewery license, as well as any required pouring license approved by a local licensing authority.

843
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:08,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, this facility may host marketing events, special events, and brewery tours.

844
01:29:09,373 --> 01:29:14,695
[SPEAKER_03]: And the facility may only sell beverages produced by and commercial goods branded by the brewery.

845
01:29:15,535 --> 01:29:18,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So on this proposed ordinance,

846
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:24,515
[SPEAKER_03]: In the table of use regulations, there are several districts which would allow this.

847
01:29:24,615 --> 01:29:32,700
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first district that's classified as a commercial one, and it's abbreviated in our zoning as a C1 designation.

848
01:29:33,521 --> 01:29:40,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And the proposal would be yes to allow breweries operating with seven barrels or under.

849
01:29:40,906 --> 01:29:46,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the C1 district, it would be SPA, which is a special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals.

850
01:29:47,479 --> 01:29:50,161
[SPEAKER_03]: for breweries operating with more than seven barrels.

851
01:29:51,042 --> 01:30:01,950
[SPEAKER_03]: And for purposes of this ordinance, a barrel is defined as a container, which is usually cylindrical in nature, used for the storage of a malt beverage with a capacity of not more than 31 gallons.

852
01:30:03,572 --> 01:30:12,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's several other districts, four other districts that would be allowed by right, commercial two district, industrial district,

853
01:30:13,428 --> 01:30:16,509
[SPEAKER_03]: an office district, and a mixed-use zoning district.

854
01:30:17,009 --> 01:30:20,009
[SPEAKER_03]: All four of those districts, the brewery would be allowed by right.

855
01:30:20,729 --> 01:30:25,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only one that would require any type of special permit is a commercial wine district.

856
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:30,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would only be for if they were operating with more than seven barrels.

857
01:30:33,131 --> 01:30:42,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, on this paper, which I think we may need to kick this around a little bit tonight, whatever point you

858
01:30:43,878 --> 01:30:45,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to address this, Mr. Chairman.

859
01:30:45,419 --> 01:30:50,963
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a proposal by Councilor Morell to amend this.

860
01:30:51,343 --> 01:30:56,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And the amendment she proposed would be to add a definition of a brewpub.

861
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:05,173
[SPEAKER_03]: And a brewpub would be an establishment that provides full on-site meal services and is also licensed to brew beer on the premises.

862
01:31:06,054 --> 01:31:09,717
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to that, a brewpub shall sell 25% or more of its beer on site.

863
01:31:12,103 --> 01:31:17,584
[SPEAKER_03]: A brew pub shall be categorized as a restaurant and not a brewery for the purposes of zoning.

864
01:31:21,225 --> 01:31:27,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Just checking the last page here, see if there's anything that's applicable for what we're gonna discuss tonight.

865
01:31:28,266 --> 01:31:33,587
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really the context of the proposed amendment that's before the board tonight.

866
01:31:33,607 --> 01:31:36,988
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you, Mr. Moki.

867
01:31:42,671 --> 01:31:48,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's open it up to members of the public.

868
01:31:49,294 --> 01:31:52,595
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to open the public portion of the hearing.

869
01:31:54,956 --> 01:32:03,660
[SPEAKER_14]: We did receive some written comments, a letter which I'll read right now from John Costas from the Metro Chamber of Commerce.

870
01:32:04,622 --> 01:32:12,186
[SPEAKER_14]: dated September 15, 2020 to Andre Leroux, Chairman and the members of the Medford Community Development Board from Medford Chamber of Commerce.

871
01:32:12,846 --> 01:32:24,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Regarding item four on the CDB's September 16, 2020 meeting agenda entitled Public Hearing Proposed Amendment to Chapter 94 Zoning to add definitions and use regulations relative to breweries.

872
01:32:26,307 --> 01:32:37,117
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford Chamber of Commerce fully supports the City Council's proposed Ordinance Amendment of Article 1, Chapter 94 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Medford as voted and passed by the City Council on July 28, 2020.

873
01:32:37,457 --> 01:32:49,188
[SPEAKER_14]: It is the consensus of the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors that allowing breweries slash taprooms in C1 and C2 districts will encourage economic development and revitalization

874
01:32:49,608 --> 01:32:59,656
[SPEAKER_14]: and that the proposed requirement that a special permit be required for breweries with greater than seven barrel production will also protect the neighborhoods from close proximity to large scale brewing operations.

875
01:33:00,357 --> 01:33:13,768
[SPEAKER_14]: It is also the consensus of the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors that the council's proposed classification of brew pubs as restaurants will also encourage economic development and revitalization without negative impact on residential districts.

876
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:22,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, the Medford Chamber of Commerce encourages the Community Development Board to approve the proposed ordinance amendment as voted by the Medford City Council.

877
01:33:23,184 --> 01:33:31,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Please note that the Chamber of Commerce would not be in support of excluding C-1 districts or requiring more restrictive special permit requirements.

878
01:33:31,629 --> 01:33:34,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Sincerely, Medford Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors.

879
01:33:38,572 --> 01:33:39,353
[SPEAKER_14]: At this time,

880
01:33:40,670 --> 01:33:47,371
[SPEAKER_18]: And can I just make a technical clarification that this board is making a recommendation to the city council.

881
01:33:47,731 --> 01:33:51,332
[SPEAKER_18]: It is not approving or denying anything, right?

882
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:52,532
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no authority.

883
01:33:52,632 --> 01:33:53,973
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a recommendation.

884
01:33:54,393 --> 01:33:54,813
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

885
01:33:54,833 --> 01:34:05,235
[SPEAKER_14]: When we receive papers from the city council like this, it is always for us to hold a public hearing and or make a recommendation back to them, which they may or may not follow.

886
01:34:08,012 --> 01:34:08,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

887
01:34:08,392 --> 01:34:10,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I see some members of the public with their hands raised.

888
01:34:11,474 --> 01:34:12,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, can you help me out?

889
01:34:14,436 --> 01:34:18,359
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Nick Bolitho and John Costas.

890
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:24,482
[SPEAKER_18]: We unmuted Nick.

891
01:34:25,143 --> 01:34:27,184
[SPEAKER_18]: Nick, you can go ahead.

892
01:34:27,244 --> 01:34:27,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.

893
01:34:27,604 --> 01:34:30,106
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies for how I should address everyone.

894
01:34:30,891 --> 01:34:36,678
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming you can hear me, although luckily if you don't seem to be able to see me either, my video button won't work.

895
01:34:39,561 --> 01:34:43,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so Medford Bronco, we've been obviously trying to

896
01:34:45,171 --> 01:34:48,733
[SPEAKER_01]: push basically the world of the brewing for quite a few years now.

897
01:34:48,853 --> 01:34:51,134
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very enticed, very into the community.

898
01:34:53,075 --> 01:35:04,362
[SPEAKER_01]: The overall plan for us to build our own brewing establishment, which has grown, we have a huge amount of following in the local community.

899
01:35:06,423 --> 01:35:10,145
[SPEAKER_01]: And as was mentioned, as David even mentioned how

900
01:35:10,745 --> 01:35:17,510
[SPEAKER_01]: and others have in the past, where there are connections, very local connections, who've invested within this company as well.

901
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:23,774
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping it's because we are all local people, really trying to make things happen overall.

902
01:35:24,574 --> 01:35:29,237
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's something great for the community that is very popular at this stage.

903
01:35:29,697 --> 01:35:37,462
[SPEAKER_01]: But Medford Brewing aside, and ignoring my slight bias because I'm Max Heinig and I own the company,

904
01:35:39,393 --> 01:35:42,377
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're really positioning and proposing is to say that

905
01:35:43,507 --> 01:35:51,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we do or we do not open a brew pub, the reality is it's the same floor space as a restaurant would have been.

906
01:35:51,232 --> 01:36:02,559
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not really a case of, as people mentioned, building gigantic sort of systems where sort of like the Harpoon Brewery or a Sam Adams Brewery.

907
01:36:02,899 --> 01:36:09,743
[SPEAKER_01]: This is much more small, local, community, boutique style, very much like a bakery.

908
01:36:10,224 --> 01:36:25,377
[SPEAKER_01]: where a Goldilocks bakery or any of the other bakeries in Medford where we basically, you take a small amount of ingredients, you mix them up and they make bagels somewhere or bread.

909
01:36:26,118 --> 01:36:30,762
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a similar fermentation type of process and we make a liquid called beer.

910
01:36:31,743 --> 01:36:36,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, the reality is Medford Brewing probably won't be opening a,

911
01:36:37,845 --> 01:36:56,090
[SPEAKER_01]: brewpub restaurant situation, but we do strongly believe that for the city of Medford and the growth of Medford and for what's really happening out there, it really makes no sense for it to be vetoed for somewhere that is providing food and beer created on site.

912
01:36:57,470 --> 01:37:00,571
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to many restaurants now, things like

913
01:37:01,121 --> 01:37:01,922
[SPEAKER_01]: Limoncello.

914
01:37:02,362 --> 01:37:03,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?

915
01:37:03,884 --> 01:37:06,126
[SPEAKER_01]: That is very similar in many ways.

916
01:37:06,166 --> 01:37:11,450
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually look down on the science of what's actually happening and restaurants are doing that now.

917
01:37:12,992 --> 01:37:21,279
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at other things where people are blending existing ingredients and doing other things to then create a secondary product.

918
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:24,662
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what we are doing, what happens with breweries.

919
01:37:25,123 --> 01:37:25,263
[SPEAKER_01]: So

920
01:37:26,222 --> 01:37:31,804
[SPEAKER_01]: said, please, all we're looking for is to say, look, this is something that a lot of people want.

921
01:37:32,064 --> 01:37:33,825
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for the development of Medford.

922
01:37:34,145 --> 01:37:36,967
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for the diversity of what we're doing as a city.

923
01:37:38,307 --> 01:37:39,388
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here for 15 years.

924
01:37:39,448 --> 01:37:44,470
[SPEAKER_01]: My business partner has been a teacher in Medford, I think for 20 years or so.

925
01:37:45,570 --> 01:37:47,491
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very, very connected.

926
01:37:48,415 --> 01:37:51,417
[SPEAKER_01]: in many ways and really want to work with the city and make things happen.

927
01:37:51,837 --> 01:38:02,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just see this as less of an entry restriction for something that will cause absolutely no difference in disruption that a restaurant would have caused.

928
01:38:03,024 --> 01:38:06,006
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, less, because a restaurant will be ordering

929
01:38:06,422 --> 01:38:08,703
[SPEAKER_01]: beer to be delivered by these gigantic trucks.

930
01:38:09,203 --> 01:38:20,486
[SPEAKER_01]: I know from my distribution side of things in my business that these are big old trucks who will block a street when any restaurants get their beer delivered.

931
01:38:21,066 --> 01:38:24,767
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, the street's blocked off because of this gigantic truck.

932
01:38:25,627 --> 01:38:30,449
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't be using these trucks or these things for the seven barrel system that we discussed.

933
01:38:30,809 --> 01:38:35,790
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't be using them because the volume of product that is made is nowhere near that volume.

934
01:38:36,408 --> 01:38:43,172
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, again, all we're asking is for you to sort of take a look and take a think of the reality of what we're trying to push.

935
01:38:44,273 --> 01:39:04,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Sue said, we probably won't be able to do the restaurant group of ourselves, but I think it's gonna really benefit the city without disruption that is already created from, as I said, either bakeries, which are fully allowed, from any other stores, even a supermarket that gets deliveries.

936
01:39:04,752 --> 01:39:07,915
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be absolutely no change whatsoever to that.

937
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:09,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Bolithico.

938
01:39:09,816 --> 01:39:12,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you just state again your name and address for the record?

939
01:39:12,498 --> 01:39:13,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I may have missed it at the beginning.

940
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:14,460
[SPEAKER_01]: No, yes.

941
01:39:14,540 --> 01:39:16,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is Bolithico.

942
01:39:16,902 --> 01:39:17,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

943
01:39:17,382 --> 01:39:18,303
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pet peeve.

944
01:39:18,563 --> 01:39:19,644
[SPEAKER_01]: To have a weird name.

945
01:39:19,904 --> 01:39:21,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always got to correct it.

946
01:39:21,966 --> 01:39:22,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm foreign.

947
01:39:22,607 --> 01:39:23,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

948
01:39:24,468 --> 01:39:28,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So Nick Bolithico of 20 Dutton Circle in Medford.

949
01:39:29,793 --> 01:39:30,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

950
01:39:31,694 --> 01:39:32,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.

951
01:39:36,486 --> 01:39:38,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie, can you unmute John Costas?

952
01:39:39,788 --> 01:39:43,731
[SPEAKER_14]: And John, sorry, I read your letter before I saw that you were on, so.

953
01:39:45,392 --> 01:39:45,592
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi.

954
01:39:46,352 --> 01:39:48,374
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, well, thank you for reading the letter.

955
01:39:48,394 --> 01:39:49,054
[SPEAKER_25]: That was fine.

956
01:39:49,094 --> 01:39:50,855
[SPEAKER_25]: You read it better than I would have read it.

957
01:39:53,637 --> 01:40:03,583
[SPEAKER_25]: Essential, I'm saying, is that we understand that it was a proposed from the council, and then what your commission does is recommend it back to the city council.

958
01:40:07,568 --> 01:40:09,950
[SPEAKER_25]: There's not much more I can say that the letter hasn't said.

959
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:14,172
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you for considering and reading the letter into the minutes.

960
01:40:15,173 --> 01:40:15,433
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

961
01:40:15,453 --> 01:40:16,174
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

962
01:40:16,234 --> 01:40:17,134
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. Costas.

963
01:40:19,556 --> 01:40:21,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Other members of the public would like to speak?

964
01:40:26,373 --> 01:40:38,156
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, seeing none, I will close the public comment portion of the hearing and open it to deliberation among the board members.

965
01:40:42,977 --> 01:40:45,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any board members who would like to comment on this?

966
01:40:52,305 --> 01:40:55,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you remind the board why it was recommended back to us?

967
01:40:56,187 --> 01:41:01,010
[SPEAKER_12]: I just feel like we've been going back and forth with recommending it back to city council.

968
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:06,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is actually a new paper from the city council.

969
01:41:06,752 --> 01:41:09,874
[SPEAKER_14]: So Annie, maybe you could clarify the history of this with this board.

970
01:41:10,392 --> 01:41:10,732
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

971
01:41:10,872 --> 01:41:13,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, this was before the board last year.

972
01:41:14,875 --> 01:41:24,422
[SPEAKER_20]: The Chapter 40A identifies timeframes that the council has to act on a proposed amendment after it's submitted to them.

973
01:41:25,182 --> 01:41:30,026
[SPEAKER_20]: And so the board acted, and then there were, I think, some Committee of the Whole meetings.

974
01:41:30,146 --> 01:41:32,127
[SPEAKER_20]: The statutory timeframes weren't met.

975
01:41:32,267 --> 01:41:35,249
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is starting anew with a

976
01:41:36,508 --> 01:41:44,995
[SPEAKER_20]: a new proposal that changed slightly from the last one and is back before the board because it's a new proposed amendment.

977
01:41:46,177 --> 01:41:46,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

978
01:41:46,897 --> 01:41:50,420
[SPEAKER_14]: This has the BRUPA definition, I believe, is new, was amended.

979
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:55,705
[SPEAKER_20]: The BRUPA definition was a proposed amendment from the council in the meeting where they referred it to you.

980
01:41:56,398 --> 01:42:07,769
[SPEAKER_20]: The changes before that were a distinction in the C1 district about the number of barrels over seven barrels requiring a special permit, but under seven barrels being allowed.

981
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:13,335
[SPEAKER_20]: In the version you reviewed last year, it was all special permit CBA in the C1 district.

982
01:42:14,056 --> 01:42:20,162
[SPEAKER_20]: And then also barrel definition was added as an associated matter with that.

983
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:21,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

984
01:42:21,130 --> 01:42:34,398
[SPEAKER_14]: And the one thing that we did add when we discussed this last year and made a recommendation to the Council on was that we, I think, wanted to make it easier for breweries to serve food if they wanted to of some kind.

985
01:42:34,418 --> 01:42:36,219
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had some language there.

986
01:42:36,259 --> 01:42:38,660
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know, Andy, if you want to read that language.

987
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:40,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have that, Andy?

988
01:42:40,961 --> 01:42:41,341
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure.

989
01:42:41,481 --> 01:42:44,163
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll pull that up.

990
01:42:45,263 --> 01:42:47,784
[SPEAKER_23]: Andre, can I ask a clarifying question while Annie's looking for that?

991
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:48,405
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

992
01:42:48,865 --> 01:42:50,806
[SPEAKER_23]: When was this originally discussed by the board?

993
01:42:50,826 --> 01:42:51,766
[SPEAKER_23]: You said last year.

994
01:42:52,767 --> 01:42:53,047
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

995
01:42:53,127 --> 01:42:56,288
[SPEAKER_20]: It was the end of, I think it was July 31, 2019.

996
01:42:56,948 --> 01:42:57,289
[SPEAKER_20]: OK.

997
01:42:57,869 --> 01:43:07,193
[SPEAKER_23]: And so for those of us who were not members of the board then, can you just also clarify, Annie, what the official recommendation of the board was then?

998
01:43:07,893 --> 01:43:08,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

999
01:43:08,134 --> 01:43:09,914
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can read that letter.

1000
01:43:12,270 --> 01:43:18,492
[SPEAKER_20]: So this is to John Falco from Chairman John DePriest, August 7th, 2019.

1001
01:43:19,953 --> 01:43:28,956
[SPEAKER_20]: Council paper 19-481 proposed amendment to chapter 94 zoning to add two new definitions and an additional line brewery to the principal uses set forth in the table of use regulations.

1002
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:39,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Following a public hearing conducted on July 31st, 2019, the Community Development Board voted to recommend that the Medford City Council adopt the proposed amendment with the following change.

1003
01:43:39,912 --> 01:43:43,156
[SPEAKER_20]: Add the following after the last line in the definition for brewery.

1004
01:43:43,597 --> 01:43:51,587
[SPEAKER_20]: Quote, the facility may also provide food that is produced on site, produced off site, or produced with food trucks that are located on site.

1005
01:43:52,248 --> 01:43:54,030
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for consideration of this recommendation.

1006
01:43:55,472 --> 01:43:55,973
[SPEAKER_20]: John DePriest.

1007
01:43:57,432 --> 01:43:58,433
[SPEAKER_12]: And what would be different?

1008
01:43:59,515 --> 01:44:00,877
[SPEAKER_12]: What is a different recommendation?

1009
01:44:01,477 --> 01:44:08,267
[SPEAKER_12]: I was there, and I'm still with the same recommendation, but I want to make sure that I have the changes clear.

1010
01:44:09,488 --> 01:44:12,793
[SPEAKER_12]: You said there was a slight change, and I'm not sure that I'm

1011
01:44:13,253 --> 01:44:24,695
[SPEAKER_14]: So the difference is that that first, sort of last year's didn't distinguish between, it basically said special permit or brewery in any of the zones.

1012
01:44:25,275 --> 01:44:29,216
[SPEAKER_14]: What this new one says is that- In the C1 zone, just to clarify.

1013
01:44:29,616 --> 01:44:30,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And was it just the C1 zone?

1014
01:44:30,696 --> 01:44:32,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just C1.

1015
01:44:32,836 --> 01:44:35,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I know that's for this one, but the last one was as well?

1016
01:44:36,337 --> 01:44:40,938
[SPEAKER_20]: So yes, the last one, it was special permit for all proposed breweries in the C1.

1017
01:44:42,522 --> 01:44:44,984
[SPEAKER_20]: Now it's distinguished by size.

1018
01:44:45,004 --> 01:44:46,345
[SPEAKER_14]: By the seven barrels, right.

1019
01:44:46,466 --> 01:44:48,968
[SPEAKER_14]: So if it's smaller than seven barrels, it's as of right.

1020
01:44:53,552 --> 01:45:07,104
[SPEAKER_14]: And the council added this brew pub definition that would basically allow a restaurant that brews their beer on site to kind of have their own definition and be explicitly approved.

1021
01:45:08,981 --> 01:45:14,104
[SPEAKER_18]: And to be clear, that's not a definition made up.

1022
01:45:14,244 --> 01:45:25,191
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a legal statute that for some reason had never been discussed in Medford prior to this past winter.

1023
01:45:26,191 --> 01:45:32,015
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's not a definition made up by our city council or legal council, but rather it's a state definition.

1024
01:45:37,177 --> 01:45:39,645
[SPEAKER_18]: that they have an option whether or not to include it.

1025
01:45:48,507 --> 01:45:54,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Board members, your thoughts supportive of allowing breweries and brew pubs with these definitions?

1026
01:45:55,270 --> 01:46:05,394
[SPEAKER_14]: And would you like to, and if so, would you, what do you think about including the, allowing them to offer food produced on the site?

1027
01:46:05,774 --> 01:46:12,257
[SPEAKER_14]: If you visited the places in Everett, for example, you'll notice that they, I don't believe they're allowed to do it on site.

1028
01:46:12,297 --> 01:46:14,438
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have food trucks like offsite.

1029
01:46:17,069 --> 01:46:23,331
[SPEAKER_14]: We just thought it might make it easier to have more flexibility for any establishments here in the city.

1030
01:46:24,331 --> 01:46:34,814
[SPEAKER_12]: If I'm not mistaken, one of the things that arose previously was that food trucks in Medford are a whole other problem.

1031
01:46:35,174 --> 01:46:38,915
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just, I want to make sure that,

1032
01:46:39,755 --> 01:46:55,602
[SPEAKER_12]: For one, I want to recommend this project just as I have before, but I want it to be in an easiest way so that the city council can pretty much rule on their end and make it as easy as possible for them to adopt our recommendations or not and move on.

1033
01:46:56,362 --> 01:47:09,028
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just want to make sure that I understand all the language here and how it can definitely be a hindrance to the proponent.

1034
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:15,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'm thinking aloud again.

1035
01:47:20,265 --> 01:47:36,619
[SPEAKER_18]: Perhaps it would be helpful if the one business that has been here to speak in favor of it, are they in favor of this language as it stands, or are they interested in seeing changes that this board should consider?

1036
01:47:37,360 --> 01:47:37,920
[SPEAKER_18]: That be fair?

1037
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:40,943
[SPEAKER_18]: And I see Nick raising his hand again.

1038
01:47:46,602 --> 01:47:49,484
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, yeah, I'm sorry, I always raise my hand for one of those people.

1039
01:47:51,125 --> 01:48:08,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so the proposition as it's laid out right now, we believe, as I said, well, again, the bottom line is a straightforward brewery should realistically just focus on brewing beer.

1040
01:48:08,917 --> 01:48:15,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So take a harpoon brewery, a big old brewery in the seaport.

1041
01:48:15,697 --> 01:48:18,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Their main focus, obviously, is that.

1042
01:48:18,718 --> 01:48:27,302
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're talking about is, obviously, yes, allowing a brewery to make food, which is great, to have that option for them.

1043
01:48:29,023 --> 01:48:36,566
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main amendment to what was put through was actually the recognition of a brew pub.

1044
01:48:37,526 --> 01:48:45,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the brew pub, unless I'm missing something, with the brew pub, it's basically to say that they serve food

1045
01:48:46,028 --> 01:48:51,354
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a restaurant that also creates basically that makes food that is sold on site as well.

1046
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:59,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of where perhaps the alteration in what was put forward from the last time you received things.

1047
01:49:01,755 --> 01:49:15,692
[SPEAKER_01]: As we know, the city of Medford is against food trucks, unless it's in their city parking lot, then it's okay, but nowhere else.

1048
01:49:18,236 --> 01:49:20,158
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I mean, the reality is

1049
01:49:20,804 --> 01:49:30,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Having all these options open at this stage is a much better place to be, I think, quite honestly, because food trucks should be a part of Medford.

1050
01:49:30,466 --> 01:49:39,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is growing like there's no tomorrow, and having these restrictions that are sort of set forth for small businesses, I think,

1051
01:49:40,729 --> 01:49:42,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's detrimental to our city.

1052
01:49:42,890 --> 01:49:50,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're growing as a city, we've got X number of food trucks, people are based in Medford, and they can't operate in their own city.

1053
01:49:51,855 --> 01:49:54,297
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's me going off on yet another tangent.

1054
01:49:55,577 --> 01:50:08,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we are very, very keen, basically, as it was put forward, we are more than happy with the new proposal was put forward through the city council that has been passed over to you.

1055
01:50:10,036 --> 01:50:13,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Bollight, though.

1056
01:50:14,118 --> 01:50:15,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's pretty straightforward.

1057
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:17,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Where does the board stand on this?

1058
01:50:18,981 --> 01:50:19,862
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, this is Christy.

1059
01:50:19,902 --> 01:50:21,803
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't see really any issues with it.

1060
01:50:21,843 --> 01:50:31,789
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, if it's similar to a restaurant, I don't really see any problems with it.

1061
01:50:31,889 --> 01:50:34,871
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's an attractive option to have in these districts.

1062
01:50:38,335 --> 01:50:47,240
[SPEAKER_19]: If someone says that there's some other different environmental impacts that require specific regulations around them, I haven't heard that.

1063
01:50:48,180 --> 01:50:51,162
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if they really differ that much from restaurants.

1064
01:50:51,262 --> 01:51:00,067
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would assume that similar regulations will apply under the zoning code.

1065
01:51:00,147 --> 01:51:01,847
[SPEAKER_19]: But I don't know.

1066
01:51:02,008 --> 01:51:02,688
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in support.

1067
01:51:03,628 --> 01:51:04,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1068
01:51:04,209 --> 01:51:04,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Peabody?

1069
01:51:05,220 --> 01:51:06,541
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I'm also in support.

1070
01:51:06,561 --> 01:51:10,525
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we should go with our last recommendation.

1071
01:51:11,806 --> 01:51:14,168
[SPEAKER_14]: And you'd like to include that language as well with it.

1072
01:51:14,548 --> 01:51:15,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it's just a recommendation.

1073
01:51:15,809 --> 01:51:17,511
[SPEAKER_14]: The city council can take it or leave it.

1074
01:51:18,211 --> 01:51:18,932
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly, yes.

1075
01:51:19,733 --> 01:51:21,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and Katie McHugh, I see you on mute as well.

1076
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:23,196
[SPEAKER_23]: Same, exactly, same.

1077
01:51:23,796 --> 01:51:24,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

1078
01:51:24,657 --> 01:51:25,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Class Andreessen.

1079
01:51:25,418 --> 01:51:28,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very much in support of this.

1080
01:51:29,401 --> 01:51:29,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1081
01:51:30,362 --> 01:51:32,284
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1082
01:51:37,498 --> 01:51:41,819
[SPEAKER_21]: Andre, we're not suggesting any conditions.

1083
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:56,004
[SPEAKER_14]: The only one that's been mentioned has been to pass along the language that we sent them the city council last time, which would allow the breweries to offer some food as well on site.

1084
01:51:58,204 --> 01:51:59,425
[SPEAKER_21]: I can make that recommendation.

1085
01:52:01,845 --> 01:52:04,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you like to include it in a motion?

1086
01:52:05,306 --> 01:52:06,007
[SPEAKER_21]: I make a motion.

1087
01:52:07,617 --> 01:52:12,298
[SPEAKER_14]: to- I guess we'd be recommending to the city council.

1088
01:52:12,318 --> 01:52:26,643
[SPEAKER_21]: Recommend to the city council that they approve this and add the recommendations from our last approval.

1089
01:52:28,063 --> 01:52:28,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1090
01:52:28,383 --> 01:52:43,496
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a motion on the floor to recommend approval of the proposed ordinance from the city council with the suggested language that we had given them last time about offering food.

1091
01:52:43,996 --> 01:52:44,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

1092
01:52:45,437 --> 01:52:50,562
[SPEAKER_20]: And just to clarify quickly, Andre, is this, this is the amendment as

1093
01:52:51,317 --> 01:52:54,239
[SPEAKER_20]: The proposed amendment as amended by the city council to include that.

1094
01:52:54,440 --> 01:52:57,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the full paper, which includes the definition.

1095
01:52:57,923 --> 01:52:59,244
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1096
01:52:59,264 --> 01:52:59,964
[SPEAKER_28]: Second.

1097
01:52:59,984 --> 01:53:00,645
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Deanna.

1098
01:53:01,786 --> 01:53:02,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Deanna.

1099
01:53:03,467 --> 01:53:04,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Move to a roll call vote.

1100
01:53:05,009 --> 01:53:05,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh.

1101
01:53:06,450 --> 01:53:06,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1102
01:53:07,571 --> 01:53:08,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Peabody.

1103
01:53:08,972 --> 01:53:09,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1104
01:53:09,733 --> 01:53:10,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaas Andresen.

1105
01:53:11,394 --> 01:53:11,494
Aye.

1106
01:53:12,275 --> 01:53:12,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd.

1107
01:53:13,596 --> 01:53:13,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1108
01:53:14,497 --> 01:53:15,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado.

1109
01:53:15,938 --> 01:53:16,038
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1110
01:53:16,743 --> 01:53:18,183
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm an aye as well.

1111
01:53:18,383 --> 01:53:26,285
[SPEAKER_14]: So one, two, three, four, five, six in favor, one recused.

1112
01:53:26,305 --> 01:53:30,547
[SPEAKER_14]: We recommend favorably this, that motion to the city council.

1113
01:53:30,567 --> 01:53:32,207
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you everybody.

1114
01:53:35,948 --> 01:53:38,869
[SPEAKER_14]: And good luck, like to see a brewery here in Medford.

1115
01:53:40,569 --> 01:53:42,590
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I can stop going all the way to Cambridge.

1116
01:53:46,802 --> 01:53:57,569
[SPEAKER_14]: The next item on the agenda is the site plan review recommendation to the Board of Appeals for 30 to 36 Salem Street.

1117
01:53:58,450 --> 01:54:08,357
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a project we heard presented for the first time last month, and we gave the proponents some feedback.

1118
01:54:09,057 --> 01:54:11,119
[SPEAKER_14]: They have come back with some revised materials.

1119
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:15,782
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a public hearing.

1120
01:54:18,839 --> 01:54:25,002
[SPEAKER_14]: But we, it is a site, our site plan review recommendation that would go to the ZBA.

1121
01:54:26,623 --> 01:54:37,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me invite Kathleen Desmond, who is the attorney for the project, to, representing the applicant, to review the new revised material for us.

1122
01:54:37,868 --> 01:54:39,669
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm on the board now.

1123
01:54:39,689 --> 01:54:41,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Lost my Wi-Fi.

1124
01:54:46,562 --> 01:54:46,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1125
01:54:49,104 --> 01:54:51,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everybody else is good though, right?

1126
01:54:51,706 --> 01:54:58,912
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe what she was going to say is that the city engineer has indicated that he can log back into the meeting if needed, if we have questions.

1127
01:55:00,073 --> 01:55:00,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1128
01:55:01,575 --> 01:55:03,977
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not know whether we do need him at this time.

1129
01:55:04,077 --> 01:55:10,042
[SPEAKER_18]: Just letting you know, if the board decides that he is needed, sorry, my Wi-Fi started to flake.

1130
01:55:10,882 --> 01:55:12,464
[SPEAKER_18]: I can text him and he'll jump back on.

1131
01:55:13,044 --> 01:55:13,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1132
01:55:13,544 --> 01:55:14,145
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Alicia.

1133
01:55:14,782 --> 01:55:19,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Chairman LaRue, board members, Kathleen Desmond of Conway Law.

1134
01:55:19,205 --> 01:55:38,040
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm here tonight with the petitioner, Paul Connolly, the manager of 34 Salem Street LLC, the design team architect, Eric Zachrisson of Context in Boston, and the project engineers, Anthony Esposito of Carver, Richard Mead of Medford Engineering, and traffic engineer, Jeffrey Dirk of Van Ness & Associates.

1135
01:55:38,581 --> 01:55:41,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Briefly, by way of background, and I know we were here last

1136
01:55:41,993 --> 01:55:48,475
[SPEAKER_17]: month, the project site 3036 Salem Street is located within Medford Square in a C1 zoning district.

1137
01:55:49,196 --> 01:55:55,898
[SPEAKER_17]: The existing structure that will be the subject of the renovation sits on a 13,910 square foot parcel.

1138
01:55:56,318 --> 01:56:02,920
[SPEAKER_17]: The building itself was built in approximately 1915 and originally housed a theater as well as a meeting and commercial space.

1139
01:56:03,661 --> 01:56:07,382
[SPEAKER_17]: As indicated at the last meeting, the Connelly family purchased the building

1140
01:56:08,083 --> 01:56:12,465
[SPEAKER_17]: in 1986, and they have been members of the community for well over 30 years.

1141
01:56:13,205 --> 01:56:19,448
[SPEAKER_17]: When the building was originally acquired, it was their intent to revive the theater and eventually have live entertainment.

1142
01:56:19,608 --> 01:56:27,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, a portion of the rear of the building where the existing parking lot now sits was in substantial disrepair and had to be removed.

1143
01:56:28,412 --> 01:56:31,373
[SPEAKER_17]: So over the years, the building has been somewhat underutilized.

1144
01:56:31,753 --> 01:56:35,395
[SPEAKER_17]: The first and second floors have housed commercial and retail tenants.

1145
01:56:35,818 --> 01:56:47,109
[SPEAKER_17]: The third floor has not been utilized due to demand for third floor space and also the improvements that would be necessary to make that attractive to a third floor tenant.

1146
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:54,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Connelly's proposal is to renovate the building in a modest scope in keeping with the character of the square.

1147
01:56:54,536 --> 01:57:00,782
[SPEAKER_17]: It provides for a one-story addition, converting the property from a three-story commercial building to a four-story mixed building

1148
01:57:01,185 --> 01:57:05,107
[SPEAKER_17]: to include one floor of commercial space and three floors of residential space.

1149
01:57:05,688 --> 01:57:13,012
[SPEAKER_17]: The footprint of the building is also being marginally extended to provide primarily for a trash room, bicycle area, and residential lobby.

1150
01:57:14,008 --> 01:57:24,658
[SPEAKER_17]: The structure, as proposed, preserves many of the historical features of the building and will recreate the signage that was originally on the, marquee signage that was originally on the 1950 building.

1151
01:57:25,699 --> 01:57:37,110
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition to providing greater detail as to the building, we've also attempted to incorporate those items the city engineer had requested as part of his comments on site plan review.

1152
01:57:37,773 --> 01:57:44,397
[SPEAKER_17]: And with that, I will turn it over to Eric Zachrisson of Context to run through the plans for you, the revised plans.

1153
01:57:44,978 --> 01:57:45,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

1154
01:57:49,881 --> 01:57:50,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Unmute me?

1155
01:57:51,021 --> 01:57:51,282
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1156
01:57:51,642 --> 01:57:52,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Now you're unmuted.

1157
01:57:53,003 --> 01:57:53,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1158
01:57:53,623 --> 01:57:55,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I share my screen?

1159
01:57:56,545 --> 01:57:57,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, please.

1160
01:57:58,866 --> 01:57:59,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

1161
01:57:59,607 --> 01:58:00,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody can see this?

1162
01:58:01,428 --> 01:58:01,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1163
01:58:12,208 --> 01:58:12,668
[SPEAKER_09]: There we go.

1164
01:58:13,649 --> 01:58:16,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everybody, for your time this evening.

1165
01:58:16,891 --> 01:58:28,959
[SPEAKER_09]: We wanted to walk you through the project, introduce you to kind of what we plan to do with this, formerly known as the Medford Theater or the Dyer Building, built in 1915.

1166
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:37,745
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll come back to this in a second, but I want to kind of walk you through from a broad planning level what we intend to do with the project.

1167
01:58:38,678 --> 01:58:43,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Across the top of the sheet here, the screen here, you would see Salem Street.

1168
01:58:45,562 --> 01:58:51,986
[SPEAKER_09]: The building is the five-sided light gray shape here.

1169
01:58:53,527 --> 01:58:54,807
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see my mouse all right?

1170
01:58:55,468 --> 01:58:55,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we can.

1171
01:58:55,968 --> 01:58:57,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1172
01:58:57,529 --> 01:59:04,233
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an existing driveway, which narrows down to about nine feet right here, and through that driveway,

1173
01:59:04,693 --> 01:59:16,617
[SPEAKER_09]: There are an existing approximately 22 spaces back here, although they vary in width and they've kind of meshed together in the current condition.

1174
01:59:18,077 --> 01:59:21,919
[SPEAKER_09]: But the parking is entered through the side.

1175
01:59:22,139 --> 01:59:32,722
[SPEAKER_09]: The building is entered currently through three retail entrances directly off of Salem Street as it stands today.

1176
01:59:33,514 --> 01:59:58,060
[SPEAKER_09]: The proposal for the project would be to consolidate the retail entrances to the center here and to add a portion approximately 20 feet deep at the rear of the property where we would add a residential lobby and we would add a few of the storage and bikes parking areas and a little bit of mechanical space

1177
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:03,613
[SPEAKER_09]: that would be desirable to have on the first floor and more accessible.

1178
02:00:05,014 --> 02:00:25,207
[SPEAKER_09]: So a resident or guest would drive down this narrowish driveway on the right side of the building and park in what will now be 18 parking spaces, one of which will be ADA accessible, and the other 17 will be

1179
02:00:28,375 --> 02:00:30,996
[SPEAKER_09]: at city standard dimensions.

1180
02:00:31,976 --> 02:00:35,557
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also a pedestrian walk, which would come along the other side of the building.

1181
02:00:36,337 --> 02:00:55,042
[SPEAKER_09]: This is property that is owned currently, and it is currently a sidewalk, but we would spruce it up to make it more of a patio feel, try and make it welcoming to bring people along this side of the property and into the back of the building where the residential lobby would have its

1182
02:00:58,268 --> 02:00:58,668
[SPEAKER_09]: entrance.

1183
02:00:59,669 --> 02:01:11,020
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a portion of the property here that we want to open up as kind of a little bit of a plaza space, a little bit of greenery and a hardscape.

1184
02:01:12,962 --> 02:01:21,649
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a handful of life safety and safety issues that kind of I think are have been critically discussed and I want to kind of point out.

1185
02:01:22,570 --> 02:01:24,132
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, there is an existing

1186
02:01:24,964 --> 02:01:27,766
[SPEAKER_09]: eight foot 10 inch high retaining wall in the rear here.

1187
02:01:27,826 --> 02:01:29,687
[SPEAKER_09]: We intend to keep that as it is.

1188
02:01:30,267 --> 02:01:39,453
[SPEAKER_09]: We intend to use some of these green spaces here for kind of snow storage and melting during the regular processes.

1189
02:01:40,574 --> 02:01:48,019
[SPEAKER_09]: We're proposing a fire hydrant back here, which has been a request that would help in safety of the upgraded building.

1190
02:01:49,180 --> 02:01:54,123
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a lot of concern about pedestrians coming across here, and we completely appreciate that.

1191
02:01:54,928 --> 02:02:18,329
[SPEAKER_09]: would hope that both switching this to a residential building would reduce the kind of inflow and outflow of vehicles, but also we'd look to add signage which would help people recognize when cars are coming down the driveway and help them to not be kind of surprised by it because this is about nine feet wide.

1192
02:02:20,722 --> 02:02:33,513
[SPEAKER_09]: There, on the left here, we broke down the C1 zoning requirements, what the existing building is and what is proposed to be changed to.

1193
02:02:33,533 --> 02:02:43,081
[SPEAKER_09]: You see that there, the parking, the lot depth, the max and minimum coverage,

1194
02:02:45,825 --> 02:02:52,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of these, they're being shifted by this addition here.

1195
02:02:52,370 --> 02:03:04,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We also broke down the commercial spaces, and we can get into those in depth, but the commercial spaces on the first floor are going to remain largely the same, and we'll see that in the next slide.

1196
02:03:06,579 --> 02:03:11,622
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of stepping back to note that this section of Salem Street is largely

1197
02:03:15,805 --> 02:03:22,990
[SPEAKER_09]: retail and office space, but there are some other residential buildings, and our building is here in the center.

1198
02:03:26,573 --> 02:03:29,915
[SPEAKER_09]: These are to highlight the existing condition.

1199
02:03:29,976 --> 02:03:34,139
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see, the building still retains much of its original detail.

1200
02:03:34,779 --> 02:03:36,280
[SPEAKER_09]: The marquee has been removed.

1201
02:03:37,481 --> 02:03:40,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these storefronts have been infilled a little bit,

1202
02:03:41,918 --> 02:04:04,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was an addition here at the third level, which enclosed an area that is kind of an outdoor space that originally was kind of parapet space, but has been enclosed by this black wood frame construction that we would be removing as part of our kind of revitalization of the project.

1203
02:04:07,436 --> 02:04:09,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Going back to the site plan for just a moment,

1204
02:04:10,838 --> 02:04:15,560
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to talk about kind of our opportunity to introduce some green space back here.

1205
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:20,863
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of our neighbors have a little bit of green space on the sides, and we want to respect that.

1206
02:04:20,983 --> 02:04:28,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And for our residents, try and dress up this rear parking area as much as possible.

1207
02:04:28,466 --> 02:04:37,450
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're showing trees and landscaping that is fairly indigenous, very typical for the area.

1208
02:04:38,502 --> 02:04:41,744
[SPEAKER_09]: and would be more resilient and leaving some green space.

1209
02:04:42,685 --> 02:04:53,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Here it would again be double as a space for snow to be kept and melted during the winter when that's necessary.

1210
02:04:55,151 --> 02:05:03,516
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the critical issues is definitely going to be how do we light this space to make it feel safe and how do we keep it both from

1211
02:05:04,555 --> 02:05:07,937
[SPEAKER_09]: interrupting the neighbors and making it inviting.

1212
02:05:08,037 --> 02:05:30,727
[SPEAKER_09]: So down this pedestrian path, we're envisioning a strategy where we would use some lighting off of the building to make it feel warm and welcoming, and to some degree warm and welcoming on the driveway side, but there also, you know, safety becomes a little bit of a different issue.

1213
02:05:31,701 --> 02:05:39,223
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to cast too much light on our neighbors, but we do want to kind of make sure that we make both of these sides feel very warm and inviting.

1214
02:05:39,263 --> 02:05:51,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we use the proper amount of downlighting, we feel like we can really minimize what gets thrown onto the neighboring properties, as you can see here.

1215
02:05:51,166 --> 02:05:52,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at the ground floor plan.

1216
02:05:53,047 --> 02:05:58,348
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is, again, Salem Street is at the top of the page, and there are currently three entrances

1217
02:06:00,628 --> 02:06:01,828
[SPEAKER_09]: different retail spaces.

1218
02:06:02,269 --> 02:06:11,772
[SPEAKER_09]: We would look to consolidate them into a single commercial lobby as more of a secure point, and then to have entrances coming to the right and to the left.

1219
02:06:12,372 --> 02:06:17,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Ideally, the Elizabeth Grady Spa that is here will remain.

1220
02:06:17,754 --> 02:06:22,015
[SPEAKER_09]: The H&R Block office space, which is here, will remain.

1221
02:06:22,595 --> 02:06:27,657
[SPEAKER_09]: The currently empty retail space in the center will be revitalized.

1222
02:06:28,117 --> 02:06:30,697
[SPEAKER_09]: So we would still have three separate retail spaces.

1223
02:06:31,698 --> 02:06:36,979
[SPEAKER_09]: What's different is that this yellow box here is the extent of the addition.

1224
02:06:37,959 --> 02:06:52,641
[SPEAKER_09]: There would be, again, you would come down the side here as a pedestrian or come and park as a driver, and there would be a residential lobby here with a new elevator to bring you up to the different levels.

1225
02:06:53,001 --> 02:06:55,842
[SPEAKER_09]: There would be a common trash room, a bike storage room,

1226
02:06:56,730 --> 02:07:06,372
[SPEAKER_09]: mechanical sprinkler room, and there might be a little bit of additional storage space for H&R Block or, you know, tenant number one, as they are on the left here.

1227
02:07:06,412 --> 02:07:12,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And this breaks down the different, the areas of the different, three different spaces and the lobby itself.

1228
02:07:14,674 --> 02:07:17,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Up above, the units are fairly, pretty repetitive.

1229
02:07:18,455 --> 02:07:22,076
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a three-bedroom and a two-bedroom and a one-bedroom on each floor.

1230
02:07:22,096 --> 02:07:23,757
[SPEAKER_09]: On level two,

1231
02:07:25,239 --> 02:07:29,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Here you see this yellow box is again the addition.

1232
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:38,262
[SPEAKER_09]: You would come up the elevator or the front common stair and into a common corridor.

1233
02:07:38,962 --> 02:07:46,724
[SPEAKER_09]: The unit on the left here is a two bedroom family sized unit facing out onto Salem Street.

1234
02:07:47,505 --> 02:07:53,546
[SPEAKER_09]: And the unit on the right here is a three bedroom, again, living and dining facing out onto Salem Street.

1235
02:07:54,789 --> 02:08:02,574
[SPEAKER_09]: This particular floor, which I believe was called the Lodge Room, is quite tall.

1236
02:08:02,774 --> 02:08:08,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we wanted to preserve that, which we think is a real amenity, but it has very tall windows.

1237
02:08:09,499 --> 02:08:15,023
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to keep this floor the height that it has always been.

1238
02:08:15,043 --> 02:08:21,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And in that space, we're going to see if we can introduce a little bit of an office loft.

1239
02:08:22,289 --> 02:08:28,855
[SPEAKER_09]: up above the kitchen and the third bedroom here, but above the kitchen and the bathroom over here.

1240
02:08:29,335 --> 02:08:35,100
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is an aspiration that we're still working out with the overall floor-to-floor heights.

1241
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:39,503
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to make sure that we can provide code-required minimum clearances.

1242
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:47,370
[SPEAKER_09]: In the back here, we will have a one-bedroom unit, which would also,

1243
02:08:49,252 --> 02:08:54,574
[SPEAKER_09]: if everything works out ideally, would also have a small loft area above the kitchen.

1244
02:08:55,795 --> 02:09:08,920
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're going to treat this as a one bedroom with one and a half bathrooms, living and dining, kind of the one unit that would face primarily towards the parking lot.

1245
02:09:09,600 --> 02:09:14,722
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as we move up to the building, we're gonna see the similar layouts.

1246
02:09:14,983 --> 02:09:18,424
[SPEAKER_09]: On the third floor, you would again have a two bedroom on the left

1247
02:09:18,895 --> 02:09:20,196
[SPEAKER_09]: and the three-bedroom on the right.

1248
02:09:21,056 --> 02:09:33,723
[SPEAKER_09]: These two units on the third floor would share or would have deck space that would be directly off of the living and dining room and will be behind the parapet.

1249
02:09:36,064 --> 02:09:44,349
[SPEAKER_09]: The existing brick parapet, which we want to kind of preserve and not change, is going to end up being quite tall.

1250
02:09:44,749 --> 02:09:47,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, as we go into the demolition and removal of this,

1251
02:09:48,204 --> 02:09:51,346
[SPEAKER_09]: We believe that there is additional structure that we can bring down.

1252
02:09:51,366 --> 02:09:58,011
[SPEAKER_09]: But it will be raised up a few steps from what is going on inside of the unit.

1253
02:09:58,091 --> 02:10:08,418
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we go through this, we're going to reconfirm that it's about 16 inches above the finished floor inside of here.

1254
02:10:09,399 --> 02:10:15,783
[SPEAKER_09]: But this parapet will still be well over four feet high and possibly as much as

1255
02:10:18,042 --> 02:10:22,044
[SPEAKER_09]: possibly as much as 56 inches above the decking.

1256
02:10:22,064 --> 02:10:25,846
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll be rather tall compared to a conventional roof area.

1257
02:10:26,586 --> 02:10:41,194
[SPEAKER_09]: In the back here, we have, again, one bedroom unit, which would be very similar to the layout on the second floor without having a loft space in any of these three units.

1258
02:10:41,954 --> 02:10:42,895
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the fourth floor,

1259
02:10:43,447 --> 02:10:52,309
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be similar to the unit below, except each of these units now has a staircase, which leads us up to a roof deck.

1260
02:10:52,869 --> 02:11:00,450
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, we've got a two bedroom on the left and a three bedroom on the right with a one bedroom facing towards the parking lot.

1261
02:11:00,990 --> 02:11:08,592
[SPEAKER_09]: All three of these lead to have their own individual staircases leading up to head houses, which would lead us to,

1262
02:11:11,033 --> 02:11:13,936
[SPEAKER_09]: what I like to term like private size decks.

1263
02:11:14,116 --> 02:11:25,166
[SPEAKER_09]: They are in the, you know, under 300 square feet, the size of a living room, not necessarily the size of a kind of party or assembly space.

1264
02:11:25,546 --> 02:11:35,555
[SPEAKER_09]: And the intention would be that this is for private residents to enjoy, but not for them to necessarily be able to have a large party or gathering.

1265
02:11:37,672 --> 02:11:49,918
[SPEAKER_09]: We broke down all of the unit sizes as well as the commercial unit on this sheet, just so people can understand roughly what they are.

1266
02:11:49,998 --> 02:11:58,662
[SPEAKER_09]: You see the three bed units come in at over 1,800 square feet and over 1,400 square feet, over 1,200 square, or over 1,400 square feet again.

1267
02:12:05,887 --> 02:12:15,272
[SPEAKER_09]: quite sizable, even the one bedrooms come in at this first one at 1217, this one at 909 and 930.

1268
02:12:15,532 --> 02:12:23,097
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're good size one bed, one and a half bath units that we will be bringing to the market.

1269
02:12:23,617 --> 02:12:29,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the overall gross area of the building, as you can see, was 11,500 and will be brought up to close to 20,000 square feet.

1270
02:12:36,805 --> 02:12:54,317
[SPEAKER_09]: So stepping back to look at the exterior of the building, we've been working or having some conversations with the Historical Association, but we've also, based on the comments that we heard in our last meeting here, spent some time

1271
02:12:55,354 --> 02:13:01,817
[SPEAKER_09]: going back and refining the design so that we can get closer to kind of what the end product will be.

1272
02:13:02,678 --> 02:13:10,301
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're looking forward to kind of working through that as we go, as we talk to the community.

1273
02:13:10,802 --> 02:13:20,987
[SPEAKER_09]: But in general, the existing building, brick and highly detailed as it will be, we'll try to restore as much as possible.

1274
02:13:21,307 --> 02:13:23,488
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a good chance that

1275
02:13:24,128 --> 02:13:30,271
[SPEAKER_09]: We believe we have a lot of the tin work for these storefronts that we can reintroduce.

1276
02:13:31,311 --> 02:13:45,917
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to bring back a marquee similar to the 1915 version of the marquee, and we want to kind of restore the detailing, some of which has aged well and some has struggled more.

1277
02:13:47,598 --> 02:13:52,900
[SPEAKER_09]: We will look to do something on the front of the facade

1278
02:13:53,492 --> 02:14:13,442
[SPEAKER_09]: that is not as complimentary, but definitely a backdrop to the more detailed and smaller scale of the brick and coping details that we're gonna see up here.

1279
02:14:13,843 --> 02:14:22,267
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had talked about using like a high-end Nichiha or seamless cement fiber panel

1280
02:14:22,912 --> 02:14:27,996
[SPEAKER_09]: potentially in a vertical orientation that gives us a very minimal number of seams.

1281
02:14:29,317 --> 02:14:40,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're kind of revisiting that and talking about whether it might be more appropriate for it to be something that is metal or something that is another material.

1282
02:14:41,365 --> 02:14:50,292
[SPEAKER_09]: But we tend to shy away from it being something that would be glossy or reflective, feeling like it

1283
02:14:50,897 --> 02:14:55,740
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't want to whatever what we do up here does not want to call a ton of attention to itself.

1284
02:14:56,281 --> 02:15:06,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're, we're looking forward to working through that with again with the historical committee and comments caveats that we receive from you here.

1285
02:15:07,348 --> 02:15:10,129
[SPEAKER_09]: So stepping over to this image.

1286
02:15:10,249 --> 02:15:13,992
[SPEAKER_09]: This is largely so that we can identify that there

1287
02:15:14,667 --> 02:15:19,992
[SPEAKER_09]: is this deep-ish well where the third floor units would walk out to.

1288
02:15:20,513 --> 02:15:24,016
[SPEAKER_09]: A couple of these three foot wide windows would actually be doors.

1289
02:15:25,397 --> 02:15:39,310
[SPEAKER_09]: We would, and we would try to kind of develop a consistency across this and whether or not these two units, these two levels become very similar or they have some, you know, variation as

1290
02:15:40,750 --> 02:15:45,294
[SPEAKER_09]: as is shown on the first and second floor, is one of the questions we're kind of working through at this point.

1291
02:15:47,696 --> 02:16:07,731
[SPEAKER_09]: At the back of the building here, you see we would probably, we will intend to kind of to take this light colored building down all the way to the back and bring it all the way around and all the way around to the other side so that the addition does not try to

1292
02:16:08,317 --> 02:16:32,287
[SPEAKER_09]: did not try to mimic the existing building, but does not try and does not try to take a lot of attention away from the existing building, but instead really serves as a clean backdrop, a technology, you know, using somewhat more common, more contemporary technologies in order to

1293
02:16:33,878 --> 02:16:40,482
[SPEAKER_09]: address the enclosure in an energy efficient and economically efficient way.

1294
02:16:40,682 --> 02:16:59,572
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a possibility that this would be the same material as what's going on up here or that we would kind of wrap the more durable material to a point either here or here in order to accentuate the front of the building and separate it from the back of the building.

1295
02:17:01,605 --> 02:17:06,689
[SPEAKER_09]: We were requested to, it was requested that we provide some shadow studies.

1296
02:17:07,429 --> 02:17:09,731
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and we did quite a few of them.

1297
02:17:10,451 --> 02:17:14,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, this right here is looking at 9 a.m.

1298
02:17:15,234 --> 02:17:22,459
[SPEAKER_09]: on, and I won't go into too much depth, but we have them all as part of the presentation, say March 21st.

1299
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:24,241
[SPEAKER_09]: The existing building is right here.

1300
02:17:24,261 --> 02:17:30,685
[SPEAKER_09]: The proposed building, which has a 20-foot addition and is one story larger, you see its shadow gets

1301
02:17:31,207 --> 02:17:32,048
[SPEAKER_09]: a little bit longer.

1302
02:17:32,068 --> 02:17:38,352
[SPEAKER_09]: You definitely see it at noon about here and over here.

1303
02:17:38,492 --> 02:17:42,295
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little longer and a little deeper into the parking lot.

1304
02:17:44,837 --> 02:17:54,564
[SPEAKER_09]: We could go to June 21st and you're going to see it doesn't really hit our parking lot and hits the side of the Baptist Church a little bit.

1305
02:17:55,324 --> 02:17:57,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, similarly, in the

1306
02:18:00,065 --> 02:18:07,650
[SPEAKER_09]: in the height of the day, it's not really, there isn't really much of a shadow from either the proposed or from the existing building.

1307
02:18:07,670 --> 02:18:10,792
[SPEAKER_09]: We could do it in December.

1308
02:18:11,273 --> 02:18:25,482
[SPEAKER_09]: We still see the extent of the proposed building kind of barely touching the neighbor here and the existing building, it kind of doesn't even quite hit the retaining wall at the back of the property.

1309
02:18:26,030 --> 02:18:33,937
[SPEAKER_09]: But as I said, we have all of these in depth in the later portion, in the appendices if we want to get into them.

1310
02:18:35,598 --> 02:18:37,260
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the bulk of our presentation.

1311
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:43,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to spend too much time talking and would prefer to spend the rest of our time answering any questions that you have.

1312
02:18:47,489 --> 02:18:47,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1313
02:18:47,769 --> 02:18:48,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1314
02:18:49,130 --> 02:18:51,152
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you very much for

1315
02:18:53,955 --> 02:18:59,138
[SPEAKER_14]: for providing a set of materials that's much easier to read and comment on.

1316
02:19:01,059 --> 02:19:03,400
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

1317
02:19:04,020 --> 02:19:12,604
[SPEAKER_14]: I would, although this isn't a public hearing, I would open it up to members of the public before the board starts deliberating if anybody wants to make a comment.

1318
02:19:12,644 --> 02:19:14,905
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's do that.

1319
02:19:15,005 --> 02:19:19,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anybody that would like to say something?

1320
02:19:22,015 --> 02:19:24,897
[SPEAKER_14]: just you can raise your hand if you're on the Zoom call.

1321
02:19:24,917 --> 02:19:30,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I see John Costas.

1322
02:19:34,505 --> 02:19:39,549
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, John Costas, 56 Haines Street, Haines, yeah, 56 Haines Street, Medford.

1323
02:19:40,369 --> 02:19:46,834
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm a neighbor of Paul's across the street, the electronic shop, and Paul and his family has been great neighbors.

1324
02:19:47,875 --> 02:19:50,957
[SPEAKER_25]: I've never had any issues for them, and I would, you know, 100% support.

1325
02:19:52,461 --> 02:19:56,445
[SPEAKER_25]: whatever he wants to do with the change he wants to make.

1326
02:19:57,065 --> 02:19:57,345
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1327
02:19:58,286 --> 02:19:58,587
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1328
02:19:58,867 --> 02:19:59,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Costas.

1329
02:20:05,212 --> 02:20:05,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other comments?

1330
02:20:08,195 --> 02:20:11,858
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, seeing none, let me open it up for board member discussion.

1331
02:20:11,878 --> 02:20:17,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.

1332
02:20:17,784 --> 02:20:18,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Andreasen.

1333
02:20:22,783 --> 02:20:24,604
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, thank you.

1334
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:31,685
[SPEAKER_21]: And I want to thank the proponent for redoing their presentation, echoing what Andre said.

1335
02:20:32,666 --> 02:20:37,847
[SPEAKER_21]: Much clearer to see and understand what you're proposing, and I thank you for that.

1336
02:20:39,007 --> 02:20:40,928
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

1337
02:20:44,909 --> 02:20:50,730
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a couple comments, and I think that Eric could probably

1338
02:20:51,378 --> 02:21:00,401
[SPEAKER_21]: knock them off one by one after I finish, instead of going one by one and answering each.

1339
02:21:03,802 --> 02:21:06,062
[SPEAKER_21]: You showed a little bit about the exterior patio.

1340
02:21:08,863 --> 02:21:14,185
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you may have included as a supplement a drawing which shows some more detail of that.

1341
02:21:15,405 --> 02:21:21,087
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think it'd be worth understanding exactly what you're proposing as far as outdoor amenity.

1342
02:21:21,905 --> 02:21:25,866
[SPEAKER_21]: for that little patio space and how that's going to feel.

1343
02:21:28,967 --> 02:21:39,431
[SPEAKER_21]: This is maybe more of a general comment for Andrea or Alicia, but it's pretty clear that they're not meeting their open space requirements.

1344
02:21:41,491 --> 02:21:44,472
[SPEAKER_21]: What does that mean for the project going forward?

1345
02:21:44,953 --> 02:21:47,834
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just basically for my edification.

1346
02:21:51,598 --> 02:21:56,780
[SPEAKER_21]: You mentioned that you were in discussions with the historic board.

1347
02:21:57,940 --> 02:22:10,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there plans for them to issue any other sort of follow-up letter based on the conversations you've had with them?

1348
02:22:14,047 --> 02:22:16,688
[SPEAKER_21]: You show in your drawings

1349
02:22:20,599 --> 02:22:23,601
[SPEAKER_21]: Some specifications for electric vehicle charging.

1350
02:22:25,402 --> 02:22:31,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that intended, or is that you didn't mention it in talking through the parking area?

1351
02:22:34,167 --> 02:22:45,615
[SPEAKER_21]: The one item that I think I probably take the biggest issue with is access and location of the trash room.

1352
02:22:47,936 --> 02:22:49,417
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems very odd to me that

1353
02:22:49,790 --> 02:23:00,157
[SPEAKER_21]: residents are gonna have to walk or go down the elevator with their bag of trash and then walk outside in the middle of winter at 11 p.m.

1354
02:23:00,717 --> 02:23:03,819
[SPEAKER_21]: when the trash fills up and go into a trash room.

1355
02:23:03,959 --> 02:23:15,466
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm wondering if you could, it's also right at the front of the building, right where really the sort of exterior residential node lies.

1356
02:23:19,125 --> 02:23:30,389
[SPEAKER_21]: Follow-up question, you're mentioning fiber cement, which I think you answered my preliminary question was whether it was going to be high density or like a hardy material.

1357
02:23:30,409 --> 02:23:38,152
[SPEAKER_21]: It sounds like high density is on your list or some sort of metal panel, which I think would be a great way to do this.

1358
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:48,135
[SPEAKER_21]: I might recommend that you do a slightly darker color to sort of tie into more of the metal elements, perhaps the new canopy that you're going to build.

1359
02:23:48,849 --> 02:23:50,190
[SPEAKER_21]: to recreate the old one.

1360
02:23:51,530 --> 02:24:03,355
[SPEAKER_21]: The white seems a little, like it might be a little harsh, but that's just my own style question.

1361
02:24:03,375 --> 02:24:17,340
[SPEAKER_21]: But my bigger question is you mentioned that the whole back including the addition starting at the ground going up would be white as well, but you didn't mention whether that would be

1362
02:24:18,898 --> 02:24:27,782
[SPEAKER_21]: the fiber cement or like perhaps a tertiary material like stucco or something else.

1363
02:24:28,562 --> 02:24:30,123
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just wondering about that.

1364
02:24:30,483 --> 02:24:46,190
[SPEAKER_21]: And if it is fiber cement, just a final caution that you're showing it going right to the ground, which is probably not the best use of that material and you should probably put some masonry at the ground on the back.

1365
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:55,982
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm assuming you're still working out the windows on the third and fourth floor.

1366
02:24:56,002 --> 02:25:04,304
[SPEAKER_21]: I noticed your plan still had the big windows, so are you doing the big ones or the small ones, or is it still being explored?

1367
02:25:04,324 --> 02:25:05,445
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's it.

1368
02:25:07,585 --> 02:25:07,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

1369
02:25:07,925 --> 02:25:09,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Mr. Zacherson, you got all that?

1370
02:25:12,393 --> 02:25:16,935
[SPEAKER_09]: As they know, but let me know if I am going to try and go on this in the same order.

1371
02:25:17,695 --> 02:25:23,177
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me know if I'm if as I miss anything in the rear patio area.

1372
02:25:23,197 --> 02:25:39,864
[SPEAKER_09]: The, the current intention is to do probably a gray paver Some potted plants that particular area with or without the the additions, we're doing tends to be rather dark and so

1373
02:25:40,665 --> 02:25:46,668
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be a little bit of a game to try and make sure that some things can survive well in there.

1374
02:25:47,188 --> 02:25:51,430
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're not planning to do an intense amount of planting there.

1375
02:25:51,471 --> 02:26:07,358
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll probably be more of a hardscape with some potted plants and maybe a table and chairs that kind of invites people to wait outside or to congregate outside a little bit.

1376
02:26:08,695 --> 02:26:17,518
[SPEAKER_09]: but not like an intense seeding zone and not necessarily, you know, and not an intense planting zone.

1377
02:26:18,758 --> 02:26:28,901
[SPEAKER_09]: But we haven't engaged a landscape architect and really put that down as a design element.

1378
02:26:29,401 --> 02:26:37,144
[SPEAKER_09]: We do not, I believe it's my last calculation, we do not meet the open space requirement and we would,

1379
02:26:38,477 --> 02:26:53,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently, we would be looking to get some relief on that as we go forward, or talk about increasing the size of the roof decks to meet that, but that didn't necessarily feel like the right approach.

1380
02:26:54,869 --> 02:26:58,571
[SPEAKER_21]: Since you're talking about it, are you going to hire a landscape architect?

1381
02:26:59,392 --> 02:27:00,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, yes, we will.

1382
02:27:02,872 --> 02:27:11,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know enough about plants and I don't think Paul does either for us to really make sure that we get the right kind of life in the background.

1383
02:27:12,254 --> 02:27:14,895
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes.

1384
02:27:15,715 --> 02:27:25,817
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as the historic board, yes, we sent over renderings pretty similar to what we are showing you today here.

1385
02:27:25,997 --> 02:27:29,438
[SPEAKER_09]: And we received some comments from them, I believe on Friday afternoon or so,

1386
02:27:31,223 --> 02:27:40,354
[SPEAKER_09]: definitely they appreciated many of the things we've done and asked, in fact, asked some of the same questions that you had asked.

1387
02:27:40,875 --> 02:27:49,625
[SPEAKER_09]: We're definitely going with the three, the smaller scale windows that we're showing here in elevation, not the ones that are shown in plan.

1388
02:27:50,886 --> 02:27:51,307
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even

1389
02:27:51,765 --> 02:27:56,446
[SPEAKER_09]: didn't even realize till you said it that we hadn't updated the plan, but the intention is to do with the smaller scale.

1390
02:27:56,766 --> 02:28:02,287
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually also asked about the white color versus a lighter gray or something darker.

1391
02:28:04,368 --> 02:28:14,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, I think we'll end up with something lighter gray since that seems to be coming from kind of everybody except me, and that's okay.

1392
02:28:16,010 --> 02:28:17,170
[SPEAKER_09]: We will do something like that.

1393
02:28:18,691 --> 02:28:20,711
[SPEAKER_09]: I had personally been trying to avoid

1394
02:28:21,467 --> 02:28:30,131
[SPEAKER_09]: getting something that was too close to the off-white of the existing building, but there are lots of other directions that we can go.

1395
02:28:30,211 --> 02:28:34,253
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that the majority is definitely pushing us in that direction.

1396
02:28:34,333 --> 02:28:35,893
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will look at that way.

1397
02:28:37,214 --> 02:28:44,037
[SPEAKER_09]: They also had some comments about the detailing of the windows and can we incorporate some of the fourth floor detailing on the third floor?

1398
02:28:44,097 --> 02:28:46,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be looking at that with them.

1399
02:28:47,438 --> 02:28:50,820
[SPEAKER_09]: They also had comments about whether the front of the building should be

1400
02:28:51,595 --> 02:29:12,803
[SPEAKER_09]: higher should be metal panel or well actually they listed a handful of metal panels that could be painted as opposed to the high-density cement fiberboard and I wanted to revisit with them the idea that this would be a higher-end cement fiberboard that we were intending to use.

1401
02:29:13,003 --> 02:29:15,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I personally, and we haven't talked about the back of the building,

1402
02:29:20,395 --> 02:29:27,379
[SPEAKER_09]: the back of the building be a similar cement fiberboard, you're right, it shouldn't come to the base.

1403
02:29:27,599 --> 02:29:36,664
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just an unresolved detail at this point, but we will definitely take into effect.

1404
02:29:37,865 --> 02:29:43,688
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a kind of question about the front part of the building and about the back.

1405
02:29:45,309 --> 02:29:47,530
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a possibility that there'll be the same material

1406
02:29:48,344 --> 02:29:56,090
[SPEAKER_09]: with a different jointing pattern or that if the front is metal, then the back wouldn't be metal.

1407
02:29:57,371 --> 02:29:59,872
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that would be appropriate for such a big scale.

1408
02:29:59,892 --> 02:30:01,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It would feel too industrial, I think.

1409
02:30:02,254 --> 02:30:11,461
[SPEAKER_09]: So we would kind of figure out the two of them hand in hand as we go through this.

1410
02:30:12,501 --> 02:30:17,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, as I was going through this, I noted that there's supposed to be a door.

1411
02:30:18,767 --> 02:30:29,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, uh, that these two rooms are probably, uh, what, uh, should be switched so that the, um, residents can use a door to drop things in the trash.

1412
02:30:29,731 --> 02:30:34,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there, it can come out and we would move the mechanical and the sprinkler over to this, this corner.

1413
02:30:34,973 --> 02:30:44,616
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, the intention is as we kind of engineer this, we can eat into this, uh, storage space on the H and R block area as we need to.

1414
02:30:44,636 --> 02:30:45,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the,

1415
02:30:50,555 --> 02:30:55,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the EV charging station, I'll have to defer to Paul Connolly.

1416
02:30:55,798 --> 02:31:00,440
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, off the top of my head, I'm not exactly sure where that sits right now.

1417
02:31:00,580 --> 02:31:05,503
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think if you could let Paul, he can probably speak to that.

1418
02:31:05,883 --> 02:31:07,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he had his hand raised.

1419
02:31:07,544 --> 02:31:11,526
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if Alicia, you can unmute Mr. Connolly.

1420
02:31:12,567 --> 02:31:18,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm supposed to have all the answers, but some of them the owner has to speak to.

1421
02:31:19,442 --> 02:31:19,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, everyone.

1422
02:31:20,663 --> 02:31:22,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1423
02:31:23,865 --> 02:31:24,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Can everyone hear me okay?

1424
02:31:25,726 --> 02:31:26,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, sir.

1425
02:31:27,547 --> 02:31:27,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1426
02:31:28,087 --> 02:31:35,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I originally raised my hand, Eric actually hit to the point where there would be a rotation on the trash in the mechanical room.

1427
02:31:36,993 --> 02:31:38,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a great point.

1428
02:31:38,414 --> 02:31:43,817
[SPEAKER_05]: We absolutely had addressed that, talking about it just didn't make its way on to this particular plan.

1429
02:31:43,877 --> 02:31:44,017
[SPEAKER_05]: But

1430
02:31:44,781 --> 02:31:57,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the, you know, having the trash accessible from the inside for the residents, as well as keeping it on an exterior wall where we'll be doing a private pickup, you know, made the most sense.

1431
02:31:58,027 --> 02:32:01,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, to your point, yeah, that is definitely our intention.

1432
02:32:02,389 --> 02:32:06,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And just be a, you know, as easy as switching around the wording in those three rooms there.

1433
02:32:07,872 --> 02:32:12,814
[SPEAKER_05]: And as to the, based on some prior conversations that we had regarding the,

1434
02:32:14,441 --> 02:32:18,005
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the electric car space, it would be our intention.

1435
02:32:18,046 --> 02:32:19,287
[SPEAKER_05]: We're definitely open to it.

1436
02:32:19,327 --> 02:32:23,993
[SPEAKER_05]: There seemed to be some desire for one, you know, and with

1437
02:32:24,940 --> 02:32:34,270
[SPEAKER_05]: nine residential units in the way the world is, chances are there could be somebody coming into the building with the use for it.

1438
02:32:34,971 --> 02:32:44,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely something that we're open to discussion on and open to having back there if the city felt it was a benefit.

1439
02:32:49,771 --> 02:32:50,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1440
02:32:50,552 --> 02:32:52,373
[SPEAKER_14]: I do a question about the parking.

1441
02:32:52,673 --> 02:32:58,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there going to be designated retail parking spaces back there?

1442
02:32:58,963 --> 02:33:15,071
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea as proposed was to have 15 of the 18 spaces we're left with go to the residential, as Eric spoke to, to try and eliminate the amount of trips in and out of that driveway during the day when that sidewalk is most heavily trafficked.

1443
02:33:16,332 --> 02:33:27,758
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we would have three spaces back there for the commercial that would most likely go to employee parking, not necessarily clientele.

1444
02:33:28,957 --> 02:33:37,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be similar fashion to the residential, where it would be one trip in, one trip out, and not multiple in and out throughout the day, if that makes sense.

1445
02:33:37,920 --> 02:33:38,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, great.

1446
02:33:41,281 --> 02:33:45,042
[SPEAKER_14]: I will throw my own comments out there right now.

1447
02:33:45,917 --> 02:33:50,718
[SPEAKER_14]: So I definitely agree with what class Andreas and said about the front facade.

1448
02:33:50,758 --> 02:33:56,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the metal cladding that you're talking about kind of wrapping around the historic part of the building makes a lot of sense.

1449
02:33:57,119 --> 02:34:00,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the darker color would look good.

1450
02:34:00,760 --> 02:34:03,301
[SPEAKER_14]: The back I'm not as concerned about.

1451
02:34:03,341 --> 02:34:13,583
[SPEAKER_14]: I think having a, you know, a lighter color back there and the, you know, cement fiber is fine, but I was wondering whether it might be possible to

1452
02:34:16,028 --> 02:34:41,222
[SPEAKER_14]: to add usable balconies on the back for those three units that are back there that don't have much other space, and also whether around the doors, the three doors that are in the rear, whether there could be some patio paver treatment around them to set them off that pedestrian area, because I don't necessarily see that indicated either.

1453
02:34:44,338 --> 02:34:58,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, to that point, I think the paver idea for the back by those doors to designate them as pedestrian friendly is a great idea and would probably tie in nicely with the walkway and patio.

1454
02:34:58,487 --> 02:35:12,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like the idea of more deck space off the back if, you know, if it didn't create any further issue for us as far as, which I don't think there's any, I think we have plenty of space off the back there, so there'd be no encroachment.

1455
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:15,901
[SPEAKER_05]: if I'm correct on that.

1456
02:35:16,081 --> 02:35:33,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, as those have those kind of Juliet balconies there, if we were to be able to put full, you know, not to the degree of the third floor balcony or the roof, but to some sort of real deck where you can maybe get a, you know, a sitting chair and take in the view of the new landscape.

1457
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:35,817
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely open to that as well.

1458
02:35:36,158 --> 02:35:36,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that'd be great.

1459
02:35:36,918 --> 02:35:43,544
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we've just seen how people being at home so much really need to have that access to open space and air.

1460
02:35:44,197 --> 02:35:59,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, into some of the buildings we've done, um, you know, the company I work with has done in designed and built in Boston, um, have done very similar to what you're saying, like not large by any means, but enough where, you know, a definite benefit and seem to be appreciated by the people moving in.

1461
02:36:00,392 --> 02:36:00,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1462
02:36:01,193 --> 02:36:01,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1463
02:36:01,513 --> 02:36:03,095
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be, that would be great.

1464
02:36:05,058 --> 02:36:12,965
[SPEAKER_14]: And then a final question that I had was the square in the back parking area that's now for snow.

1465
02:36:14,186 --> 02:36:18,029
[SPEAKER_14]: What is that going to look like when there's not snow stored there?

1466
02:36:18,890 --> 02:36:19,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1467
02:36:19,670 --> 02:36:23,113
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea is to keep it as green space.

1468
02:36:24,787 --> 02:36:43,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And to whatever tool, whatever capability, and this may be when we bring in the landscape architect to help us design the ideas to make that as pretty as possible in the non-snow season, which depending on the New England winter can be hopefully nine months.

1469
02:36:45,173 --> 02:36:52,176
[SPEAKER_05]: But also the idea was to keep it as flat as possible to allow the snow storage there, but still having this green space.

1470
02:36:52,436 --> 02:36:58,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, one possibility that I think we saw in another project was to make it like a little doggy pad area.

1471
02:36:58,179 --> 02:37:01,480
[SPEAKER_14]: So if people have pets, they have a place to go with them.

1472
02:37:03,221 --> 02:37:04,582
[SPEAKER_05]: That's actually a great idea.

1473
02:37:04,602 --> 02:37:11,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And as the owner of a inpatient lab, I think they would appreciate that.

1474
02:37:11,044 --> 02:37:11,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's obviously a,

1475
02:37:13,480 --> 02:37:21,123
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it takes away from them potentially doing it on the more common, you know, patio space and stuff where it would look a little nicer.

1476
02:37:21,343 --> 02:37:23,344
[SPEAKER_05]: It draws it away, which I think is a great idea.

1477
02:37:25,685 --> 02:37:28,807
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, and is that, Klaas, I think that was you that was gonna speak.

1478
02:37:28,827 --> 02:37:30,948
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I just had a couple follow-up things.

1479
02:37:31,148 --> 02:37:35,149
[SPEAKER_21]: I think all the answers have been great.

1480
02:37:37,891 --> 02:37:40,592
[SPEAKER_21]: I echo what Andre says about the dog area.

1481
02:37:40,632 --> 02:37:43,073
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that'd be a great way to sort of do

1482
02:37:43,979 --> 02:37:46,020
[SPEAKER_21]: two things in one space.

1483
02:37:48,100 --> 02:37:54,662
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like you should do a little more study of the bike area.

1484
02:37:55,022 --> 02:37:58,463
[SPEAKER_21]: It seems really small.

1485
02:37:59,583 --> 02:38:01,024
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't have to go into detail about that.

1486
02:38:01,084 --> 02:38:09,986
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just, you know, these days, the requirements for bike storage are getting more and more.

1487
02:38:10,066 --> 02:38:12,667
[SPEAKER_21]: We don't quite have them in place here in Medford yet,

1488
02:38:14,410 --> 02:38:19,414
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm certain it would be more than that for the amount of units you have.

1489
02:38:21,555 --> 02:38:24,857
[SPEAKER_21]: And I guess my last comment, if Eric, you can go to the last page.

1490
02:38:30,541 --> 02:38:37,126
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think, you know, the original, and I understand that you're going to, this is probably still evolving.

1491
02:38:40,048 --> 02:38:44,852
[SPEAKER_21]: you're gonna be moving the doors to a common center vestibule, which I think is fine.

1492
02:38:45,873 --> 02:38:55,680
[SPEAKER_21]: But I really love the look and feel of the entries to the stores on each side of the building here.

1493
02:38:56,621 --> 02:39:00,444
[SPEAKER_21]: And even the glass transom up above.

1494
02:39:00,484 --> 02:39:07,970
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would encourage you, because I think I saw a rendering, it was either on the first page or something, where it looks like you're keeping the existing signage the way it is.

1495
02:39:08,736 --> 02:39:27,049
[SPEAKER_21]: And I would really encourage you to take a second look at that and see if there's a way that you can really bring in this sort of the scale and proportion of these old storefronts and try to integrate the signage into that rather than putting them right below the windows where they are in the rendering you had on the first page.

1496
02:39:27,949 --> 02:39:35,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Whether it's taking that glass transom panel and turning that into your signage band or somehow integrating it into the sort

1497
02:39:37,315 --> 02:39:39,217
[SPEAKER_21]: subcornice there above them.

1498
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:51,770
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like you're doing a lot of really nice work to the front of this building, so to leave the signage the way it is would be kind of a shame.

1499
02:39:55,007 --> 02:39:57,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely open to that.

1500
02:39:57,328 --> 02:40:04,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually partial to the paneling, the square paneling and detail work of the original building myself.

1501
02:40:05,390 --> 02:40:07,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see that come back to life.

1502
02:40:07,871 --> 02:40:24,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And like you said, if we were, I think from practicality to use that one common entrance to have everyone come in, but to maybe have the appearance to as much as possible to the original facade, the mimic the doorways that are there.

1503
02:40:25,057 --> 02:40:26,338
[SPEAKER_05]: to a degree I think would be great.

1504
02:40:26,399 --> 02:40:31,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I think we just put the signage up there to see everyone get an idea of what it looks like today.

1505
02:40:31,623 --> 02:40:34,205
[SPEAKER_05]: But I agree with you there as well.

1506
02:40:35,867 --> 02:40:49,279
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea is to restore the Dyer building to its former glory and open to a discussion on what the best use of being able to let the businesses that are there advertise and let people know what's in there.

1507
02:40:50,323 --> 02:40:54,766
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, in a way that really reflects the character of the facade.

1508
02:40:56,507 --> 02:40:56,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1509
02:40:56,867 --> 02:40:57,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1510
02:40:57,387 --> 02:40:59,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And class, I'm really glad you went back to that.

1511
02:40:59,108 --> 02:41:05,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause that was my final comment that I forgot to make is looking at this was, I do love that, you know, the glass transoms as well.

1512
02:41:05,912 --> 02:41:14,998
[SPEAKER_14]: And just the, and on the bottom along the sidewalk, those dark rectangular panels, I feel that that could really,

1513
02:41:16,418 --> 02:41:21,559
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, echo the kind of a darker metal treatment on the facade that's being built above.

1514
02:41:22,179 --> 02:41:26,880
[SPEAKER_14]: I really like how that could, you know, incorporating those details as possible.

1515
02:41:27,721 --> 02:41:37,283
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I'm very, you know, this is very exciting and it's interesting, you know, I think your idea is to replicate the canopy as it once was.

1516
02:41:37,303 --> 02:41:41,404
[SPEAKER_21]: I think, you know, at the end of the day where that ends up, we'll see.

1517
02:41:43,193 --> 02:41:52,760
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think my point is I would put the similar amount of passion into the whole street frontage at that first floor and how that works.

1518
02:41:55,844 --> 02:42:01,205
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you there, and I can tell you passion is the right word for that, because that's what this project is for me.

1519
02:42:02,366 --> 02:42:11,948
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been, literally my entire life, I've spent in that building, in and around it, and when I was old enough to walk, I was apparently old enough to be put to work there.

1520
02:42:13,268 --> 02:42:16,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would, you know, I really do want to come to

1521
02:42:17,697 --> 02:42:20,479
[SPEAKER_05]: get to a point where it's not just a building that gets approved.

1522
02:42:20,559 --> 02:42:22,560
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that everyone's excited about.

1523
02:42:23,060 --> 02:42:24,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know I am.

1524
02:42:24,381 --> 02:42:30,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to be a part of it and to really spearhead this.

1525
02:42:30,844 --> 02:42:36,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping that we get to a point where everyone else is equally as excited to see the finished product.

1526
02:42:38,248 --> 02:42:38,788
[SPEAKER_21]: That's great.

1527
02:42:38,848 --> 02:42:39,869
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an exciting project.

1528
02:42:39,909 --> 02:42:40,189
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1529
02:42:42,579 --> 02:42:43,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, go ahead.

1530
02:42:43,401 --> 02:42:47,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Please just say who you are because I can't actually, I don't have everybody on the screen right now.

1531
02:42:48,063 --> 02:42:52,706
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Jackie Furtado, board member, vice chair.

1532
02:42:53,106 --> 02:43:00,051
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things that I wanted to go back and say was I wanted to reiterate what Clay said, and thank you for actually providing us a visual.

1533
02:43:00,471 --> 02:43:05,454
[SPEAKER_12]: I pretty much, at our last meeting, was getting excited with the information that was given.

1534
02:43:05,774 --> 02:43:14,220
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the problems that I was having was more information needed to be articulated to make sure that we captured the essence of what your project would be.

1535
02:43:14,700 --> 02:43:30,900
[SPEAKER_12]: And I started to go there, but I have to tell you where it got me is that in my line of work, going around 351 cities and towns in the state of Massachusetts, I review a lot of projects, development projects, and it was just really hard for me to zoom in.

1536
02:43:33,503 --> 02:43:35,804
[SPEAKER_12]: do the work that we needed your visuals to do.

1537
02:43:35,904 --> 02:43:40,025
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to let you know that this is a huge improvement and I extremely thank you.

1538
02:43:40,085 --> 02:43:51,767
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am just as, if not more excited about this mixed use development, especially the fact that it's being redeveloped on a redeveloped site prior to state's community development principles.

1539
02:43:51,827 --> 02:43:57,169
[SPEAKER_12]: So I have nothing further to say, but to express my appreciation for that.

1540
02:43:57,189 --> 02:43:59,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1541
02:44:00,029 --> 02:44:00,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1542
02:44:00,510 --> 02:44:02,090
[SPEAKER_14]: Other board members want to weigh in?

1543
02:44:02,803 --> 02:44:21,804
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, this is Chrissy Dowd, I'd just like to say that I echo all the comments, I really appreciate the great comments that Clace and Andrea provided, and I was thinking about a similar line of questioning in terms of the scope of the historic restoration and the entrances, and I'm glad to hear about

1544
02:44:23,466 --> 02:44:30,291
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, the commitment to sort of bring some of that original design back.

1545
02:44:30,732 --> 02:44:42,561
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm just very excited that this building is going to be redeveloped and really, you know, focusing on restoring this building and creating a mixed use.

1546
02:44:42,601 --> 02:44:46,324
[SPEAKER_19]: Cause I think it's very important to the city of Medford in this area.

1547
02:44:46,685 --> 02:44:49,567
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you very much for a great presentation.

1548
02:44:49,747 --> 02:44:50,268
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have,

1549
02:44:50,889 --> 02:44:53,056
[SPEAKER_19]: a much better understanding of the project.

1550
02:44:54,280 --> 02:44:54,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, thank you.

1551
02:44:58,235 --> 02:44:59,457
[SPEAKER_23]: Andrea, I don't have anything different.

1552
02:45:00,558 --> 02:45:01,498
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll just say ditto.

1553
02:45:01,679 --> 02:45:03,160
[SPEAKER_23]: I've always loved this building.

1554
02:45:03,340 --> 02:45:05,222
[SPEAKER_23]: It's one of my favorites in the square.

1555
02:45:05,242 --> 02:45:14,170
[SPEAKER_23]: And I've often sort of just wondered as a resident right like what what could be more in this particular space.

1556
02:45:14,830 --> 02:45:15,991
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's really exciting to see.

1557
02:45:16,071 --> 02:45:21,977
[SPEAKER_23]: I particularly love this picture of the building, you know, over 100 years ago, and I think

1558
02:45:22,417 --> 02:45:30,044
[SPEAKER_23]: whatever can be done to preserve and resurrect some of that historical nature of the building would just be really cool.

1559
02:45:30,225 --> 02:45:31,846
[SPEAKER_23]: So this was a great presentation.

1560
02:45:31,886 --> 02:45:32,286
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1561
02:45:32,306 --> 02:45:34,288
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1562
02:45:34,849 --> 02:45:35,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Wonderful.

1563
02:45:36,570 --> 02:45:38,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other board members have comments at the time?

1564
02:45:40,514 --> 02:45:41,715
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, Andre, I'll take a shot.

1565
02:45:42,096 --> 02:45:42,456
[SPEAKER_16]: It's David.

1566
02:45:42,476 --> 02:45:43,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, David.

1567
02:45:46,750 --> 02:45:51,591
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't try to retread some of the great comments that we've already had and the feedback you've received tonight.

1568
02:45:52,812 --> 02:46:03,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to reiterate my enthusiasm for that storefront, to see that that is sort of brought back to its former grandeur as much as possible.

1569
02:46:05,096 --> 02:46:14,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're all enthused about this as the kind of project we'd like to see more and more of in Medford Square, both on the residential side, but also on the storefront.

1570
02:46:14,104 --> 02:46:20,429
[SPEAKER_16]: We're sort of hoping that this will be the kickoff to better things ahead for many of the other buildings in your neighborhood.

1571
02:46:22,170 --> 02:46:26,513
[SPEAKER_16]: My one specific question, I guess, is on the patio, which to my eye looks pretty nice.

1572
02:46:27,134 --> 02:46:33,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Could it be, instead of these solid pavers, could it be something more permeable, or would you keep that in mind as you design that?

1573
02:46:36,668 --> 02:47:02,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm open to a conversation as to something that would, one of the, as that's all concrete walkway back there right now and concrete under in the back, we were, the idea of the paver was to add a more permeable surface, but if there's a system that could be put in place that still, like you said, keeps the integrity of the patio, but is more permeable, open to that conversation as well.

1574
02:47:04,428 --> 02:47:05,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, it seems like that would be nice.

1575
02:47:05,589 --> 02:47:12,212
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Klaas had mentioned the open space, and I think that would be a benefit to the property to find a way to do that.

1576
02:47:13,573 --> 02:47:14,593
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are my only comments.

1577
02:47:14,673 --> 02:47:15,574
[SPEAKER_16]: It looks real good.

1578
02:47:16,314 --> 02:47:23,117
[SPEAKER_18]: If I might just sort of add that information on there, there are pavers and there are permeable pavers.

1579
02:47:23,778 --> 02:47:32,262
[SPEAKER_18]: And so as you're going forward with that, if you get a landscape designer, just keep that in mind that just because it's a paver doesn't mean that it's permeable.

1580
02:47:32,878 --> 02:47:39,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and we talked a little bit about it just, I think it was this morning, I don't know.

1581
02:47:40,084 --> 02:47:46,909
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like a long time ago, but we need to make sure we maintain ADA access.

1582
02:47:47,470 --> 02:48:00,540
[SPEAKER_09]: So it might be a combination of some permeable pavers and some non or like what goes on in the substrate, but definitely a desire to drain what we can using permeable pavers where we can.

1583
02:48:03,109 --> 02:48:11,917
[SPEAKER_09]: And we may extend that out to the, I really like the idea of extending that out to the other three doors or to the doors and kind of using that to tie everything together.

1584
02:48:11,937 --> 02:48:24,949
[SPEAKER_14]: A question, Alicia, for you, is there, does this project, does it fall under the city's solar ordinance at all?

1585
02:48:28,257 --> 02:48:36,868
[SPEAKER_18]: We believe that it does, that it requires 50% of the roof to have solar panels.

1586
02:48:36,928 --> 02:48:38,510
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd have to review the details of that.

1587
02:48:38,550 --> 02:48:43,896
[SPEAKER_18]: But basically, the first requirement is that it has a solar assessment.

1588
02:48:44,597 --> 02:48:56,850
[SPEAKER_18]: that is then submitted to the Director of Energy and Environment, which happens to be myself, and that solar assessment would inform us whether or not solar panels are practical as designed.

1589
02:48:57,831 --> 02:49:00,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Building code requires that the

1590
02:49:02,376 --> 02:49:07,199
[SPEAKER_18]: the roof be solar ready so that the structure be strong enough to support solar panels.

1591
02:49:08,059 --> 02:49:21,726
[SPEAKER_18]: The question about whether or not the shading is appropriate, the location is appropriate would come through with an assessment and any solar company, I believe, would do a solar assessment for free in the hopes that you would then hire them to put the solar panels on.

1592
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:29,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you guys looked at that at all, or is this sort of a new issue?

1593
02:49:29,324 --> 02:49:34,989
[SPEAKER_18]: We actually have not had a building permitted since we passed that.

1594
02:49:35,109 --> 02:49:37,751
[SPEAKER_18]: It was actually only passed last Halloween.

1595
02:49:39,373 --> 02:49:44,057
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we haven't actually had, or it was signed last Halloween.

1596
02:49:45,672 --> 02:49:51,794
[SPEAKER_18]: a building go fully through the permitting process since then, from start to finish.

1597
02:49:52,134 --> 02:49:59,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually a building that's large enough to fall under that ordinance takes a long time to be permitted.

1598
02:50:00,077 --> 02:50:02,098
[SPEAKER_18]: So actually we haven't had one come through yet.

1599
02:50:03,338 --> 02:50:04,339
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that what you were asking?

1600
02:50:04,359 --> 02:50:11,621
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I was actually asking the proponent whether they had considered solar at all and whether they were aware of this.

1601
02:50:12,581 --> 02:50:13,862
[SPEAKER_09]: We were, I believe.

1602
02:50:14,688 --> 02:50:18,629
[SPEAKER_09]: speak with you, Alicia, about this at the beginning of it, like... Yeah, in January.

1603
02:50:18,649 --> 02:50:21,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Pre-COVID, way back in the normal days.

1604
02:50:21,370 --> 02:50:22,310
[SPEAKER_18]: Pre-COVID we discussed.

1605
02:50:22,970 --> 02:50:24,030
[SPEAKER_09]: In the normal days, yeah.

1606
02:50:24,530 --> 02:50:28,911
[SPEAKER_09]: We did talk about it a little bit and are looking forward to working through that with you.

1607
02:50:28,931 --> 02:50:33,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so, yeah, great.

1608
02:50:35,253 --> 02:50:40,254
[SPEAKER_29]: I had one question about the signs coming in and out of the driveway.

1609
02:50:42,094 --> 02:50:44,155
[SPEAKER_29]: How big are they and how do they work?

1610
02:50:44,235 --> 02:50:44,555
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you know?

1611
02:50:46,557 --> 02:50:48,038
[SPEAKER_29]: or like how well they're placed?

1612
02:50:48,898 --> 02:50:57,942
[SPEAKER_09]: I am learning how they work and what they're assigned, what the kind of, what is considered safe sizes are.

1613
02:50:57,962 --> 02:51:06,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe, if I can, maybe I can zoom in on these to get the dimensions.

1614
02:51:06,847 --> 02:51:12,329
[SPEAKER_09]: These are, we are discovering what is considered safe.

1615
02:51:12,409 --> 02:51:14,950
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like these are being drawn right now at 18 inches by 14 inches.

1616
02:51:16,730 --> 02:51:22,673
[SPEAKER_09]: So kind of a pedestrian scale, but not a very large.

1617
02:51:22,993 --> 02:51:29,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we don't know if that's the completely appropriate, but that's what we've been looking at with our civil engineers.

1618
02:51:29,836 --> 02:51:36,119
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what seems like the appropriate kind of common size.

1619
02:51:36,179 --> 02:51:43,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can work with whatever recommendations to identify what is really appropriate for this particular space.

1620
02:51:44,523 --> 02:51:46,565
[SPEAKER_14]: And those signs would be motion activated?

1621
02:51:46,585 --> 02:51:46,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1622
02:51:48,567 --> 02:51:52,291
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could, Jeff Dirk is on the call, our traffic engineer.

1623
02:51:52,331 --> 02:51:58,777
[SPEAKER_17]: He may be able to provide a little more information in that regard, if you still have questions concerning that.

1624
02:52:00,635 --> 02:52:01,435
[SPEAKER_17]: how they operate.

1625
02:52:02,936 --> 02:52:05,357
[SPEAKER_27]: I could offer, they will be sensor operated.

1626
02:52:05,377 --> 02:52:09,358
[SPEAKER_27]: So yeah, motion or sensor, but they're going to pick up whether a vehicle is entering.

1627
02:52:09,419 --> 02:52:12,240
[SPEAKER_27]: So there'll be just like your garage door has those light beams.

1628
02:52:12,720 --> 02:52:17,962
[SPEAKER_27]: It's pretty much operates on the same principle or there could be... Or anything in the pavement.

1629
02:52:18,627 --> 02:52:19,928
[SPEAKER_27]: Or in the pavement, exactly.

1630
02:52:20,448 --> 02:52:29,416
[SPEAKER_27]: The variations that we've shown here are basically you see the LED signs that are there, which are less obtrusive, I would say.

1631
02:52:29,736 --> 02:52:33,539
[SPEAKER_27]: The lower sign is a version where it's a backlit sign.

1632
02:52:33,799 --> 02:52:39,584
[SPEAKER_27]: So it basically blanks out under either situation, but in the lower version,

1633
02:52:40,390 --> 02:52:46,795
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, the signs there, when it detects a vehicle, light bulbs are behind the sign that turn on to illuminate the sign itself.

1634
02:52:47,255 --> 02:52:52,419
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's just a variation on the types of signs that could be used, but they all operate the same way.

1635
02:52:55,721 --> 02:53:01,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And would they be maintained by the homeowner's association or something like that, I would assume?

1636
02:53:02,146 --> 02:53:07,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that would be part of the association requirement that they maintain those.

1637
02:53:12,837 --> 02:53:12,977
Great.

1638
02:53:12,997 --> 02:53:18,098
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thank you.

1639
02:53:19,038 --> 02:53:32,861
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a representative from the Historical Commission, so I just want to give them the chance to speak briefly if they feel they have something to add to the conversation.

1640
02:53:33,481 --> 02:53:36,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Peter Miller, I believe, is here.

1641
02:53:36,301 --> 02:53:39,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to give him the chance to speak as is Doug Carr.

1642
02:53:44,798 --> 02:53:45,998
[SPEAKER_14]: You're still muted, Peter.

1643
02:53:52,440 --> 02:53:55,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Alicia, can you, or Annie, can you unmute Peter?

1644
02:53:58,081 --> 02:54:00,182
[SPEAKER_18]: I just clicked on him, so now he can unmute.

1645
02:54:00,242 --> 02:54:01,562
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1646
02:54:01,582 --> 02:54:02,602
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, now can you hear me?

1647
02:54:03,003 --> 02:54:03,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we can now.

1648
02:54:03,783 --> 02:54:03,963
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1649
02:54:04,523 --> 02:54:08,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just wanted to reiterate some of the other comments.

1650
02:54:08,724 --> 02:54:09,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Great step forward.

1651
02:54:13,371 --> 02:54:18,174
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a few more comments about the facade, maybe the durability of the fiber cement.

1652
02:54:18,915 --> 02:54:26,119
[SPEAKER_08]: We weren't saying we had to have metal, but we like the direction that the facade's going with the kind of three groups of three windows.

1653
02:54:27,200 --> 02:54:37,947
[SPEAKER_08]: And just some questions about the articulation on the third floor should probably reflect what's going on on the fourth floor, so that detail carries down.

1654
02:54:39,548 --> 02:54:39,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And...

1655
02:54:42,778 --> 02:55:06,253
[SPEAKER_08]: So similar concerns about the storefront, the drawings are a little bit vague, so we just kind of wanted to have a little more specificity on, you know, what the materials are, how they actually fit together, you know, where the real, what the control joints really are, some issues like that, but we thought it was a great step forward from the previous iteration.

1656
02:55:06,654 --> 02:55:08,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Doug, you have anything more to add on that?

1657
02:55:10,956 --> 02:55:12,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Miller, just a question about your process.

1658
02:55:12,698 --> 02:55:18,201
[SPEAKER_14]: So are you still, it sounds like you're still in dialogue with the proponent?

1659
02:55:18,862 --> 02:55:27,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, when they sent us the renderings, which are pretty much what you saw tonight, we did

1660
02:55:29,297 --> 02:55:35,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, kind of throw those around amongst the commissioners, the architects on our commission.

1661
02:55:36,119 --> 02:55:44,381
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, we came up with some comments, so we sent another round of comments to, um, to the architect.

1662
02:55:44,941 --> 02:55:52,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and so the, the current drawings don't really reflect that yet, but it's in process.

1663
02:55:53,004 --> 02:55:53,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1664
02:55:53,344 --> 02:55:57,785
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess you could say it's an ongoing dialogue, which we're happy to

1665
02:55:58,320 --> 02:56:02,122
[SPEAKER_08]: keep going if people want us to.

1666
02:56:02,202 --> 02:56:04,303
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.

1667
02:56:04,323 --> 02:56:07,764
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe that the applicant is certainly open to that moving forward.

1668
02:56:07,784 --> 02:56:08,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely, yeah.

1669
02:56:10,285 --> 02:56:13,267
[SPEAKER_15]: If I could add, I think this is great progress.

1670
02:56:13,307 --> 02:56:19,449
[SPEAKER_15]: I think both Eric and the owner there have been, and Paul, have done a great job to work with us.

1671
02:56:19,549 --> 02:56:27,253
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what's really needed is to take all these comments from ourselves and also the board and do a summary kind of final

1672
02:56:27,962 --> 02:56:39,084
[SPEAKER_15]: elevation final model to show that gray, to show some of the details we talked about, to show that the gray is going to return a certain distance on the sides and then become a different material.

1673
02:56:39,104 --> 02:56:42,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And obviously the details at the storefront and the retail.

1674
02:56:42,745 --> 02:56:44,525
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're all on the same page.

1675
02:56:44,565 --> 02:56:46,086
[SPEAKER_15]: We're all on a path of success here.

1676
02:56:46,426 --> 02:56:47,926
[SPEAKER_15]: It just needs to be tightened up a little bit.

1677
02:56:50,127 --> 02:56:51,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1678
02:56:52,227 --> 02:56:52,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1679
02:56:54,787 --> 02:57:05,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, so I guess my question is, and maybe, Annie, you can unmute and respond to this a little bit.

1680
02:57:08,899 --> 02:57:13,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Should we put all this together?

1681
02:57:13,322 --> 02:57:15,364
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the timeline with the ZBA?

1682
02:57:17,265 --> 02:57:21,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Presently, we have a date next week for the ZBA.

1683
02:57:22,850 --> 02:57:23,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Their September meeting is

1684
02:57:24,470 --> 02:57:25,250
[SPEAKER_17]: is next week.

1685
02:57:25,910 --> 02:57:36,614
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'd like to hit that date only because of the time to get the decision, and then construction is only a certain amount of time before we hit the dead of winter that's going to kind of stop things in its tracks.

1686
02:57:39,315 --> 02:57:44,596
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just wondering how the design issues are going to be nailed down before you go into the ZBA.

1687
02:57:48,263 --> 02:57:56,369
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we're willing to continue to work with the staff and the board on those issues, but we still have a long way to go in terms of approval.

1688
02:57:57,930 --> 02:58:06,296
[SPEAKER_17]: In addition to the special permit, there are variances that we need to obtain in this regard to move the project forward.

1689
02:58:07,117 --> 02:58:11,500
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's a decision that has to be written, which generally takes 30 to 60 days.

1690
02:58:11,540 --> 02:58:16,484
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we'd like to come out of here with a recommendation we have made

1691
02:58:17,137 --> 02:58:24,042
[SPEAKER_17]: strides in terms of design, no one's trying to move the board out of that process, and we're more than willing to work that way.

1692
02:58:24,522 --> 02:58:33,448
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that to keep going through these iterations without knowing at the end of the day when we're gonna get the variances, or if we will, creates some issues for the applicant.

1693
02:58:35,650 --> 02:58:42,795
[SPEAKER_18]: This is one of the difficulties with how our process currently works, is that they need to get a number of zoning variances.

1694
02:58:44,203 --> 02:58:48,824
[SPEAKER_18]: The zoning board will say, did this board approve it or not?

1695
02:58:49,164 --> 02:58:56,866
[SPEAKER_18]: They're not gonna look at the design in detail, like the colors and the facade and all.

1696
02:58:58,047 --> 02:59:03,368
[SPEAKER_18]: I did hear from our city engineer that he is comfortable with this moving forward to the zoning board.

1697
02:59:04,288 --> 02:59:10,350
[SPEAKER_18]: He's not on the call, but we texted to make sure we had that from him, because we don't have an updated letter.

1698
02:59:14,225 --> 02:59:23,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, well, I think it's up to the board whether we want to try to put together a motion here to vote on.

1699
02:59:23,250 --> 02:59:30,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like if we were to do that, we would have a series of conditions.

1700
02:59:31,035 --> 02:59:38,279
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd be making a recommendation of approval to the Zoning Board of Appeals for special permit site plan review with

1701
02:59:40,060 --> 02:59:40,820
[SPEAKER_14]: conditions.

1702
02:59:42,241 --> 02:59:48,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Conditions, I know that Annie put some together based on our comments from last time, and let me read those right now.

1703
02:59:49,564 --> 02:59:55,907
[SPEAKER_14]: One, snow shall be removed from the parking area and drive once accumulation negatively affects use of parking area.

1704
02:59:56,488 --> 03:00:03,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Two, preparation and approval by the Medford Police Department and Traffic Commission of a construction traffic management plan.

1705
03:00:04,351 --> 03:00:08,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Plan should include delivery of construction materials during off-peak hours.

1706
03:00:09,920 --> 03:00:16,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Three, provide for safe pedestrian access along Salem Street on the north side throughout the construction period.

1707
03:00:17,306 --> 03:00:24,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Four, consider use of the parking area for longer term parking to reduce the number of potential pedestrian conflicts from the enter and exit drive.

1708
03:00:24,671 --> 03:00:26,753
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that has been addressed.

1709
03:00:27,273 --> 03:00:33,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Five, comply with recommendations from the following department heads and letters addressed to Chairman Scott Carman.

1710
03:00:33,898 --> 03:00:38,782
[SPEAKER_14]: That's Fire Chief Giliberti, City Engineer McGivern,

1711
03:00:39,690 --> 03:00:44,572
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the public health director, Marianne O'Connor.

1712
03:00:46,472 --> 03:00:53,754
[SPEAKER_14]: And I haven't heard any issues from the proponent with complying with those department head letters.

1713
03:00:53,914 --> 03:00:55,615
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm assuming we're good there.

1714
03:00:55,635 --> 03:00:56,955
[SPEAKER_17]: That's correct.

1715
03:00:57,195 --> 03:01:00,176
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have incorporated most of them into the plan at this point.

1716
03:01:00,736 --> 03:01:05,718
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I would add a few conditions that we discussed tonight, including

1717
03:01:07,487 --> 03:01:23,395
[SPEAKER_14]: the extension of the permeable paver area to the rear doorways, internal access to the trash room.

1718
03:01:27,256 --> 03:01:36,621
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would like to, well, would the proponent be okay then with also adding the rear balconies?

1719
03:01:37,794 --> 03:01:40,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely on the rear balconies.

1720
03:01:40,395 --> 03:01:42,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great asset.

1721
03:01:42,776 --> 03:01:55,120
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing I would say in that regard to the extent that there's any issue with setbacks, because the multifamily units on floors two through four create a whole other set of dimensional requirements that we're going to need relief from.

1722
03:01:55,560 --> 03:02:05,663
[SPEAKER_17]: So as long as we can work within the context of what we have now in terms of the request for relief that we're looking for, and I don't anticipate any issues,

1723
03:02:06,188 --> 03:02:12,491
[SPEAKER_17]: But without seeing what the design is, it's kind of hard to say whether they create any further zoning issues for the project.

1724
03:02:13,752 --> 03:02:22,596
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can put together a spec pretty quickly so we can review that ahead of any decision that would need to be made.

1725
03:02:22,656 --> 03:02:29,159
[SPEAKER_05]: But to the degree, to the scale of what they would actually be, I don't think it would create a problem.

1726
03:02:29,399 --> 03:02:31,320
[SPEAKER_14]: But you have one.

1727
03:02:31,420 --> 03:02:32,661
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make sure.

1728
03:02:32,701 --> 03:02:32,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1729
03:02:34,186 --> 03:02:38,748
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, maybe we can just say to the extent feasible, keep it simple.

1730
03:02:40,329 --> 03:02:47,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I would like to put some language in there to make sure that the design piece continues moving forward.

1731
03:02:48,693 --> 03:02:55,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And rather than us try to micromanage that, I would maybe like to refer to, I guess,

1732
03:03:03,550 --> 03:03:14,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if it's approval by the Historic Commission or if it's adopting the recommendations of the Historic Commission.

1733
03:03:14,994 --> 03:03:22,317
[SPEAKER_18]: Could we say that they continue to work with the Historic Commission on the historic aspects of the building?

1734
03:03:26,857 --> 03:03:32,179
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know how to enforce it if they next week say, no, we're not doing that anymore.

1735
03:03:33,160 --> 03:03:48,786
[SPEAKER_18]: But if the historic board came back and said they are refusing to talk to us anymore, it would be as if they had gone against any other one of the conditions that the board puts on a project.

1736
03:03:50,347 --> 03:03:51,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, does the historic commission

1737
03:03:53,368 --> 03:03:54,269
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no real.

1738
03:03:54,829 --> 03:03:57,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any further process that you guys need to take as a commission?

1739
03:03:59,813 --> 03:04:06,497
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think it's I think it's just seeing a final design that reflects all the comments we've heard tonight.

1740
03:04:06,538 --> 03:04:07,638
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really all we need.

1741
03:04:09,139 --> 03:04:10,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, but maybe we could.

1742
03:04:17,423 --> 03:04:28,566
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys, if you don't, if I'm able to speak to, if you guys want to put some language in there that, you know, adds a comfort level, you know, when your guys end, I completely understand that too.

1743
03:04:28,626 --> 03:04:33,167
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just would like to speak to the fact that I would operate in good faith.

1744
03:04:33,307 --> 03:04:41,830
[SPEAKER_05]: And I really do think we're all on track to the same end result, something that we all really, really do think would be a great, great fit for the square.

1745
03:04:42,720 --> 03:04:54,284
[SPEAKER_05]: seem to be close and happy to continue the conversation and get to a, get to a place where, you know, in the time that we have going forward, get to a place that we're all very happy with the end result.

1746
03:04:55,104 --> 03:04:55,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1747
03:04:57,185 --> 03:05:07,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Annie, is there a way of doing this where we basically, I know that, you know, we can work on the language and maybe try to tweak that, you know,

1748
03:05:09,359 --> 03:05:17,629
[SPEAKER_14]: this week where we can incorporate with more detail like what we've heard from the board members as well as the historic commission?

1749
03:05:20,172 --> 03:05:28,721
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we will need to turn this around fairly quickly if the ZBA meeting is next week, but we could turn that around tomorrow and Friday.

1750
03:05:29,883 --> 03:05:30,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1751
03:05:30,520 --> 03:05:50,145
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe saying something along the lines of adopting the design recommendations as discussed at the September 16th community development board meeting to the resolve to the satisfaction of the board and the historic commission.

1752
03:05:51,945 --> 03:05:52,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Would that be acceptable?

1753
03:05:57,806 --> 03:05:59,047
[SPEAKER_20]: That's acceptable to me, yes.

1754
03:06:06,788 --> 03:06:12,190
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, and my board members, am I missing anything that we discussed?

1755
03:06:12,210 --> 03:06:16,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there is also the, I think the dog pad we talked about.

1756
03:06:20,954 --> 03:06:21,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yep, it was that.

1757
03:06:22,675 --> 03:06:23,955
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't to me, right?

1758
03:06:23,975 --> 03:06:26,376
[SPEAKER_14]: In the rear, in the parking area.

1759
03:06:30,558 --> 03:06:32,599
[SPEAKER_17]: That's acceptable.

1760
03:06:33,265 --> 03:06:33,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1761
03:06:33,925 --> 03:06:41,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you know, the final thing that I hadn't mentioned that I was, I was curious about is it looks like the internal hallway doesn't have any windows.

1762
03:06:41,968 --> 03:06:43,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I reading that correctly?

1763
03:06:43,649 --> 03:06:49,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I, if not, it seems like there should be a window in that hallway.

1764
03:06:51,952 --> 03:06:53,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I did notice that.

1765
03:06:53,212 --> 03:06:54,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It currently does not have a window.

1766
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:02,303
[SPEAKER_09]: because it ends in stairs at either side and has units on both ends of it.

1767
03:07:02,323 --> 03:07:04,585
[SPEAKER_09]: We've tried to minimize its overall size.

1768
03:07:05,865 --> 03:07:07,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently, it does not have a window.

1769
03:07:07,026 --> 03:07:14,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we can punch them into the stairs on either side, which we have not done.

1770
03:07:14,311 --> 03:07:21,196
[SPEAKER_09]: But the core itself is separated from the stairs by fire-rated doors.

1771
03:07:25,038 --> 03:07:26,379
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not any kind of requirement.

1772
03:07:28,988 --> 03:07:35,849
[SPEAKER_09]: We could we can incorporate we could incorporate one if that was a requirement Very close.

1773
03:07:35,869 --> 03:07:38,950
[SPEAKER_14]: I think did you just say it's not any client kind of requirement, right?

1774
03:07:40,870 --> 03:07:41,990
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't say it's typical.

1775
03:07:42,691 --> 03:07:46,631
[SPEAKER_14]: No, okay I wasn't sure it looked like on one end.

1776
03:07:46,651 --> 03:07:56,053
[SPEAKER_14]: It was not the stairway was not exactly at the terminus so it seemed like there was an opportunity to put at the end of the hallway a window, but I

1777
03:07:57,117 --> 03:07:57,917
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you're right.

1778
03:07:57,997 --> 03:08:00,418
[SPEAKER_09]: On the second and third floor, we could if that was a requirement.

1779
03:08:03,159 --> 03:08:06,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think- Why don't you just look at it and see if it makes sense?

1780
03:08:07,380 --> 03:08:07,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1781
03:08:09,701 --> 03:08:18,223
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we could just put some, craft some language along the lines of incorporate natural light into the hallway where feasible.

1782
03:08:21,124 --> 03:08:21,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1783
03:08:24,905 --> 03:08:26,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I think that,

1784
03:08:27,513 --> 03:08:28,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that covers everything.

1785
03:08:29,014 --> 03:08:30,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Am I missing anything, anybody?

1786
03:08:38,300 --> 03:08:55,090
[SPEAKER_14]: So is there a motion on the floor to recommend special permit site plan review approval to the ZBA with the conditions that we just articulated?

1787
03:08:55,870 --> 03:08:57,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think we have to repeat them all.

1788
03:08:59,345 --> 03:09:00,366
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll make that motion, Andre.

1789
03:09:01,626 --> 03:09:02,206
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Katie.

1790
03:09:02,226 --> 03:09:03,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a second?

1791
03:09:04,047 --> 03:09:04,327
I'll second.

1792
03:09:05,708 --> 03:09:06,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Klaus.

1793
03:09:07,129 --> 03:09:07,889
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote.

1794
03:09:08,750 --> 03:09:09,310

1795
03:09:09,930 --> 03:09:10,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg?

1799
03:09:14,452 --> 03:09:14,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1800
03:09:15,293 --> 03:09:16,073
[SPEAKER_14]: Klaus Andresen?

1801
03:09:16,793 --> 03:09:16,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1802
03:09:17,654 --> 03:09:18,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd?

1803
03:09:19,255 --> 03:09:19,415
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1804
03:09:20,175 --> 03:09:20,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado?

1805
03:09:21,696 --> 03:09:21,816
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

1806
03:09:22,276 --> 03:09:23,417
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm an aye as well.

1807
03:09:23,477 --> 03:09:25,117
[SPEAKER_14]: So unanimous decision.

1808
03:09:27,263 --> 03:09:31,646
[SPEAKER_14]: in favor, recommending to the ZBA site plan review approval.

1809
03:09:31,666 --> 03:09:33,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Terrific.

1810
03:09:33,387 --> 03:09:34,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1811
03:09:34,548 --> 03:09:35,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for all the work that you did.

1812
03:09:35,969 --> 03:09:37,309
[SPEAKER_14]: Really appreciate it.

1813
03:09:38,310 --> 03:09:39,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a good night, folks.

1814
03:09:39,891 --> 03:09:40,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1815
03:09:40,211 --> 03:09:40,571
[SPEAKER_14]: You too.

1816
03:09:40,892 --> 03:09:41,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Take care.

1817
03:09:51,037 --> 03:10:00,443
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, the last item on our agenda tonight is the local historic district recommendation to the city council for 16 Foster Court.

1818
03:10:01,464 --> 03:10:14,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to be clear, this is not a public hearing, nor is there any kind of a permit that we're simply making a recommendation to the city council.

1819
03:10:18,175 --> 03:10:33,783
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a language in the local ordinances stating that any historic districts should come before the CD board, but it doesn't say that we have to do anything or say anything about it.

1820
03:10:34,823 --> 03:10:41,767
[SPEAKER_14]: So really it's at our discretion whether or not we make a recommendation to the city council and what that recommendation is.

1821
03:10:42,927 --> 03:10:47,750
[SPEAKER_14]: So at this point, I would like

1822
03:10:48,783 --> 03:11:03,388
[SPEAKER_14]: to invite Ryan Hayward to present the proposal so that we can all kind of hear the rationale behind it and decide whether we'll make a recommendation or not.

1823
03:11:04,968 --> 03:11:05,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1824
03:11:06,108 --> 03:11:10,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some slides to share just with some history if you guys want to see them.

1825
03:11:11,250 --> 03:11:15,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do it verbally, but if you want just some fun history, I'm happy to share that.

1826
03:11:15,691 --> 03:11:17,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, my other account.

1827
03:11:18,661 --> 03:11:23,443
[SPEAKER_07]: which I will see if I can share my screen.

1828
03:11:23,563 --> 03:11:23,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

1829
03:11:23,903 --> 03:11:32,726
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that slides would be great, but if we could keep the presentation to a minimum, I know it's already getting late, that would be excellent.

1830
03:11:33,506 --> 03:11:34,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I could do that.

1831
03:11:35,186 --> 03:11:40,088
[SPEAKER_07]: So just in short, we have two historic boards on the city.

1832
03:11:40,508 --> 03:11:43,529
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a historic district commission and historic commission.

1833
03:11:44,069 --> 03:11:45,910
[SPEAKER_07]: The 16 Foster Court building could

1834
03:11:46,583 --> 03:11:47,824
[SPEAKER_07]: comes under the demo delay.

1835
03:11:48,284 --> 03:11:59,209
[SPEAKER_07]: We review buildings that are up for demolition and we have 18, you know, we have a two-step process that we review them and then we have 18 months to have the owners work with us on

1836
03:12:01,202 --> 03:12:09,524
[SPEAKER_07]: on coming up with a way to mitigate the loss of the building, possibly perhaps meaning to alter their plans for renovation to include some new designs.

1837
03:12:10,464 --> 03:12:18,405
[SPEAKER_07]: The owner was unwilling to do that, so the Historical Commission approached the Historic District Commission about establishing a new local historic district in the city.

1838
03:12:19,225 --> 03:12:21,606
[SPEAKER_07]: We're allowed to do that under Mass General Law 40C.

1839
03:12:22,686 --> 03:12:26,767
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to submit the report to Mass Historical and the Planning Board, and you guys are

1840
03:12:27,347 --> 03:12:48,198
[SPEAKER_07]: acting planning board and you know we got good feedback from mass historical and you know we had a public hearing on it a lot of people support the district we had a committee of the whole meeting tonight about with the owner and the city council and it seems like city council is leaning towards supporting it but we need to have a site visit but we're

1841
03:12:48,938 --> 03:12:49,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Still moving forward with it.

1842
03:12:50,579 --> 03:12:53,860
[SPEAKER_07]: The building in summary, just five quick points.

1843
03:12:54,800 --> 03:12:59,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford at one point had one quarter of all of the Commonwealth shipbuilders.

1844
03:12:59,222 --> 03:13:02,043
[SPEAKER_07]: This building has ties to several shipyard owners.

1845
03:13:02,143 --> 03:13:03,884
[SPEAKER_07]: It has ties to the ship carpenters.

1846
03:13:05,325 --> 03:13:06,925
[SPEAKER_07]: It has associations with J.T.

1847
03:13:06,965 --> 03:13:09,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Foster, who Foster Corp is named after.

1848
03:13:09,026 --> 03:13:11,927
[SPEAKER_07]: It is rare in the sense that it is 18

1849
03:13:15,170 --> 03:13:21,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Built between 1804 and 1814, it's one of three federal era Cape Cod buildings remaining in the city.

1850
03:13:22,444 --> 03:13:25,129
[SPEAKER_07]: That alone puts it in a really elite group of buildings.

1851
03:13:25,723 --> 03:13:31,047
[SPEAKER_07]: buildings and it just maintains good integrity over its long course of its life.

1852
03:13:31,167 --> 03:13:42,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, using the history as leverage, you know, we tried to work with the owner to at least preserve a portion of the building, but he was unwilling to even entertain any options.

1853
03:13:42,115 --> 03:13:45,738
[SPEAKER_07]: He presented a ton of stuff tonight, so at least the dialogue is moving forward still.

1854
03:13:46,378 --> 03:13:59,668
[SPEAKER_07]: but what we're looking to do is to have you guys hopefully support us in this district, in other districts that are coming up and we promise that we'll give you guys more time to digest information.

1855
03:13:59,688 --> 03:14:10,096
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean I know it's quick to be able to digest a hundred page report one night so and of course with larger districts the report will be bigger so we want you guys to play a bigger and better role.

1856
03:14:10,136 --> 03:14:10,517
[SPEAKER_07]: We just

1857
03:14:11,492 --> 03:14:16,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We just want to make sure that we include this one, which is under the deadline now at this point.

1858
03:14:16,956 --> 03:14:22,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Hayward, you, I think, have permission to show your slides now.

1859
03:14:22,099 --> 03:14:23,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're a co-host.

1860
03:14:25,822 --> 03:14:26,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1861
03:14:26,342 --> 03:14:36,409
[SPEAKER_07]: It may take a minute.

1862
03:14:53,962 --> 03:14:54,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, it's come up now.

1863
03:14:56,005 --> 03:14:56,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

1864
03:14:58,086 --> 03:15:02,749
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I just, you know, why the Haskell Cutter House, just to show you guys what the building looks like.

1865
03:15:02,809 --> 03:15:12,855
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a small Cape Cod that has undergone a series of changes, but its original form is evident.

1866
03:15:12,895 --> 03:15:16,797
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a single story building with rooms underneath the eaves.

1867
03:15:16,897 --> 03:15:21,279
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got its center chimney, and it's got this little nice Italian bracket that was added in the 1850s.

1868
03:15:26,475 --> 03:15:29,937
[SPEAKER_07]: A proposed district mimics the historic lot.

1869
03:15:30,058 --> 03:15:31,278
[SPEAKER_07]: The lot hasn't changed since 1804.

1870
03:15:31,539 --> 03:15:34,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's rare that that happens.

1871
03:15:34,881 --> 03:15:40,645
[SPEAKER_07]: But this building, the historic district would preserve both the house and the lot together.

1872
03:15:40,665 --> 03:15:44,228
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're not trying to dissuade development here.

1873
03:15:44,288 --> 03:15:50,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Historic district is really to encourage development that's compatible with the existing buildings.

1874
03:15:57,725 --> 03:16:04,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, Foster Corp being a witness to history, they would... Thatcher Magoon is our first shipbuilder in Medford.

1875
03:16:05,307 --> 03:16:11,068
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Isaac Sprague and Galen James who are his apprentice.

1876
03:16:11,588 --> 03:16:15,029
[SPEAKER_07]: They live in this neighborhood and then J.T.

1877
03:16:15,109 --> 03:16:16,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Foster buys out the entire thing.

1878
03:16:16,829 --> 03:16:19,970
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a picture just showing you guys the last

1879
03:16:20,780 --> 03:16:22,744
[SPEAKER_07]: ship built in Medford the Pilgrim in 1873.

1880
03:16:22,804 --> 03:16:33,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, this building which is located just below the tree line here right on the right hand side, you know, was witness to both the comings and the goings of the shipyard era.

1881
03:16:35,392 --> 03:16:40,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Foster Court is a part of the larger shipbuilding landscape.

1882
03:16:40,276 --> 03:16:47,741
[SPEAKER_07]: There's something like 900 pre-1900 buildings in East Medford where this building is located.

1883
03:16:48,782 --> 03:16:52,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Of them, maybe 500 of them are shipbuilding buildings.

1884
03:16:52,485 --> 03:17:00,491
[SPEAKER_07]: And then this one is of the elite elite, just because there's probably less than 10 that are in that window that the building was built.

1885
03:17:03,897 --> 03:17:06,644
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just see the 1855 map of Medford.

1886
03:17:06,664 --> 03:17:09,851
[SPEAKER_07]: You can just see the density and where 16 Foster Court was.

1887
03:17:09,891 --> 03:17:13,661
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of an outlier, but it's got all this great history behind it.

1888
03:17:16,466 --> 03:17:20,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And we did look at the neighborhood, but the neighborhood has some integrity issues.

1889
03:17:21,788 --> 03:17:22,709
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the buildings is gone.

1890
03:17:22,769 --> 03:17:27,711
[SPEAKER_07]: The Isaac's break house was cut into four pieces and moved to Dedham, Massachusetts.

1891
03:17:28,732 --> 03:17:30,672
[SPEAKER_07]: The Joshua Foster house was demolished.

1892
03:17:30,732 --> 03:17:40,377
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few houses that remain duplexes that house the shipbuilding workers, but this really is the most historic building of all of them.

1893
03:17:41,038 --> 03:17:49,837
[SPEAKER_07]: And just Patrick McLuhan's yard, you can see the foster court is up here featuring prominently and basically everything surrounded the shipyards.

1894
03:17:54,353 --> 03:18:05,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And just that point where I made virtually all traces of the industry have disappeared for having one quarter of all of the Commonwealth shipbuilders at one time and having built 568 ships.

1895
03:18:06,380 --> 03:18:08,861
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only a handful of buildings.

1896
03:18:09,001 --> 03:18:10,302
[SPEAKER_07]: I count three.

1897
03:18:11,022 --> 03:18:17,686
[SPEAKER_07]: This one with its association with the shipyard owners, another house on Court Street, and then there's a little tiny counting house on Riverside Ave.

1898
03:18:17,826 --> 03:18:20,688
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're doing our best to preserve the buildings.

1899
03:18:21,068 --> 03:18:33,836
[SPEAKER_07]: basically save them from demolition, to continue to partner with various city boards, with the public, with private entities, and just try to make preservation a bigger part of Medford's open dialogue.

1900
03:18:36,667 --> 03:18:38,648
[SPEAKER_07]: with those who are coming here and working with us.

1901
03:18:38,728 --> 03:18:41,929
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, I saw the Salem Street project tonight.

1902
03:18:41,969 --> 03:18:44,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's one of the good projects.

1903
03:18:44,650 --> 03:18:51,333
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think 16 Foster Court, if we're allowed time to have a dialogue with that owner, will develop into something good.

1904
03:18:51,373 --> 03:19:02,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the meantime, at this point, the only way to preserve the building is to put it in a historic district, to continue that dialogue and to hope that the building is safe for future generations.

1905
03:19:03,223 --> 03:19:10,389
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, hopefully we, you know, continue to work on this and establish other districts and do good things in the city.

1906
03:19:12,230 --> 03:19:12,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's it.

1907
03:19:12,791 --> 03:19:13,711
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I got.

1908
03:19:13,751 --> 03:19:14,772
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to take questions.

1909
03:19:14,792 --> 03:19:17,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to continue dialogue as you need me.

1910
03:19:18,962 --> 03:19:20,683
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, thank you, Mr. Hayward.

1911
03:19:22,104 --> 03:19:28,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Just because it's getting late, I won't beat around the bush here, and I'll just throw some concerns out there.

1912
03:19:29,167 --> 03:19:43,053
[SPEAKER_14]: I live literally two blocks away from this property, and I loved, I read all of the material that was, the packet of materials, like 100 pages or so.

1913
03:19:45,254 --> 03:19:47,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Loved all the old maps, the history,

1914
03:19:49,154 --> 03:19:51,935
[SPEAKER_14]: really enjoy, you know, learning more about this.

1915
03:19:52,035 --> 03:19:57,257
[SPEAKER_14]: I want Medford to be able to preserve and promote its history better.

1916
03:19:58,297 --> 03:20:06,640
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have to say that this particular house is not very kind of

1917
03:20:07,651 --> 03:20:13,794
[SPEAKER_14]: You wouldn't even notice that aesthetically that it's a historic house if you didn't have all of that information.

1918
03:20:14,674 --> 03:20:30,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's one concern that I have is what is the value, the long-term value of this vis-a-vis other development that might be moving forward on the site to create housing.

1919
03:20:32,701 --> 03:20:35,342
[SPEAKER_14]: And just in terms of fair play, creating a

1920
03:20:38,198 --> 03:20:43,341
[SPEAKER_14]: historic district as a property owner, you know, is starting to move forward with something.

1921
03:20:43,401 --> 03:20:50,786
[SPEAKER_14]: I am a little concerned about kind of that as a process issue in terms of fair play for a property owner.

1922
03:20:52,427 --> 03:21:03,314
[SPEAKER_14]: I would really like to see these historic districts happen, but in a more proactive way as part of a set of priorities that, you know,

1923
03:21:04,478 --> 03:21:15,625
[SPEAKER_14]: parcels are identified or properties identified, and then we're taking action before there's development that's on route to being proposed.

1924
03:21:16,646 --> 03:21:22,490
[SPEAKER_14]: And the district itself, as you alluded to, has really changed a lot, right?

1925
03:21:22,530 --> 03:21:31,816
[SPEAKER_14]: We've lost, I would say, the most significant historic properties in the neighborhood

1926
03:21:32,378 --> 03:21:38,461
[SPEAKER_14]: The boatyards, the shipyards itself are totally built over.

1927
03:21:40,002 --> 03:21:44,405
[SPEAKER_14]: The kind of the shipbuilders homes are largely gone.

1928
03:21:44,985 --> 03:21:54,030
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess, you know, I wanna be supportive and at the same time, I'm just a little concerned about this.

1929
03:21:54,070 --> 03:21:58,713
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know if you could respond to any of those points.

1930
03:22:01,062 --> 03:22:04,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I can respond to a few of them.

1931
03:22:04,125 --> 03:22:08,610
[SPEAKER_07]: First, howdy neighbor, because I am not too far from here as well.

1932
03:22:08,730 --> 03:22:10,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, I walked by the building a lot.

1933
03:22:10,351 --> 03:22:21,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I, you know, as both commissions have said multiple times at multiple meetings, we do want to encourage development in the city so long as it's not at the expense of history, you know, so we

1934
03:22:22,283 --> 03:22:39,431
[SPEAKER_07]: you know we approached this project as an open dialogue to first at least analyze looking at reusing the building and the homeowner wasn't even willing to do that so we were kind of at an impasse because you know we're being told by city council that we're not a design review board and we're you know so we can't look at the proposed

1935
03:22:39,971 --> 03:22:48,414
[SPEAKER_07]: building that's there, you know, unless of course it comes through you guys for site plan review or some sort of other community review where we get a comment period.

1936
03:22:49,114 --> 03:22:57,877
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, you know, we have to look at first mitigating the demo and seeing if there's a way to integrate new design into it and the owner wouldn't even do that.

1937
03:22:57,937 --> 03:22:58,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were kind of

1938
03:22:59,745 --> 03:23:02,587
[SPEAKER_07]: stuck where we were not getting any sort of data out of them.

1939
03:23:02,667 --> 03:23:13,213
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do want to encourage people to have a dialogue with us and to be able to come to us and explore different options first, you know, and not just tell us, you know, it can't be done.

1940
03:23:14,694 --> 03:23:28,803
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we definitely, you know, there's three architects on the board, there's, you know, a real estate agent, and, you know, there's a bunch of different people that definitely want to use their professional expertise to help guide the, you know, guide the process here.

1941
03:23:29,043 --> 03:23:29,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And

1942
03:23:29,732 --> 03:23:42,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you know, we, we definitely want to, uh, you know, try to preserve our history and in a way that, that is not at the expense of, you know, stopping the city from moving forward at all.

1943
03:23:43,641 --> 03:23:50,465
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, I see, uh, Cles Andreson, uh, will speak and then I'll open it to, I think, Christy Dowd as well.

1944
03:23:51,906 --> 03:23:52,426
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead, Cles.

1945
03:23:52,947 --> 03:23:54,788
[SPEAKER_21]: So Ryan, thank you for your presentation.

1946
03:23:55,068 --> 03:23:58,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, can you talk a little bit about,

1947
03:23:59,340 --> 03:24:03,342
[SPEAKER_21]: The fact that this house is for sale for a dollar.

1948
03:24:03,362 --> 03:24:15,068
[SPEAKER_21]: And with the caveat that it gets moved to a suitable site and restored properly.

1949
03:24:17,882 --> 03:24:25,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm not clear why the owner decided to list the building for sale at such a late point in the game.

1950
03:24:25,924 --> 03:24:34,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps it's to demonstrate that he's making some sort of effort to find somebody to rehabilitate the property, but I have not.

1951
03:24:35,007 --> 03:24:38,748
[SPEAKER_07]: We were aware that the building went on MLS because we were notified, but

1952
03:24:39,460 --> 03:24:40,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, not by the homeowner.

1953
03:24:41,081 --> 03:24:44,364
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we had changed and that listening.

1954
03:24:44,404 --> 03:24:45,504
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not at our request.

1955
03:24:45,945 --> 03:24:52,349
[SPEAKER_07]: What we asked them to do was to, you know, over 16 months ago was to at least start by looking at the design.

1956
03:24:52,769 --> 03:24:55,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And only tonight were we able to get information out of them.

1957
03:24:56,232 --> 03:24:56,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

1958
03:24:57,109 --> 03:25:06,212
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, at a city council meeting in front of all the city councilors and not before our board to be able to digest and talk about and have any sort of dialogue.

1959
03:25:06,312 --> 03:25:10,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not sure why the owner decided to list that something that way.

1960
03:25:11,033 --> 03:25:14,214
[SPEAKER_21]: So do you have a position on that potential outcome?

1961
03:25:16,095 --> 03:25:20,736
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I would be okay with the building moving to a new site.

1962
03:25:21,076 --> 03:25:23,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually, you know,

1963
03:25:24,378 --> 03:25:38,884
[SPEAKER_07]: tossed out the idea of possibly using the open lots across the street for that or maybe a land swap or something that encourages perhaps a different location for this building or a different location for the proponents project.

1964
03:25:38,964 --> 03:25:45,867
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I haven't explored that deeply because, you know, the onus is on the builder to present options

1965
03:25:46,313 --> 03:25:48,815
[SPEAKER_07]: and for us to give feedback, and we've had none.

1966
03:25:48,935 --> 03:25:52,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And even with this, he didn't approach us, he just listed the building.

1967
03:25:52,739 --> 03:25:57,303
[SPEAKER_07]: We're definitely not against working with him, we just are trying to...

1968
03:25:58,675 --> 03:26:06,944
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, follow through with one of the proposals, you know, and we prioritize this building over the three others that are currently under demo delay.

1969
03:26:06,984 --> 03:26:18,778
[SPEAKER_07]: There's other buildings, but they're simply not to, you know, they're important to the city, and they certainly rose to the occasion of the demo delay, but out of all of them, we prioritize this particular building.

1970
03:26:18,838 --> 03:26:19,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if we had to

1971
03:26:20,179 --> 03:26:32,644
[SPEAKER_07]: had multiple buildings under demo delay, I think the board would have prioritized this building out of all of them, simply for the age alone, but then with the history associated with it, I think they definitely would have prioritized this building.

1972
03:26:33,365 --> 03:26:35,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

1973
03:26:36,066 --> 03:26:42,168
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I mean, I was just going to say, like for me, I really appreciate what you've said, Andre.

1974
03:26:44,569 --> 03:26:46,670
[SPEAKER_21]: The best possible outcome would be

1975
03:26:47,013 --> 03:26:50,496
[SPEAKER_21]: for me would be to move the building to a more appropriate site.

1976
03:26:50,596 --> 03:26:52,918
[SPEAKER_21]: Like it's kind of lost there now.

1977
03:26:53,018 --> 03:27:02,385
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I'm imagining some wonderful situation where it gets moved to a prominent site somewhere near the square, maybe somewhere near the river.

1978
03:27:02,405 --> 03:27:04,426
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, that would be wonderful.

1979
03:27:05,667 --> 03:27:14,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Even as a, you know, as a historic relic, you know, that just is just maintained.

1980
03:27:14,714 --> 03:27:15,715
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I know that's all,

1981
03:27:16,372 --> 03:27:38,671
[SPEAKER_21]: pie in the sky thinking, but I just wonder about a recommendation for us based on considering that, because actually for me, knowing that neighborhood, that seems like a better outcome than leaving it where it is and preserving it.

1982
03:27:39,191 --> 03:27:43,555
[SPEAKER_21]: Because frankly, even if it's preserved in place, I think

1983
03:27:44,411 --> 03:27:52,775
[SPEAKER_21]: what's going to happen is it's going to end up getting like, you know, just anecdotally, let's say it's 800 square feet.

1984
03:27:52,835 --> 03:27:57,317
[SPEAKER_21]: It's going to end up getting another 2000 square feet tacked onto the back of it.

1985
03:27:57,357 --> 03:27:58,658
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's going to look like garbage.

1986
03:27:58,718 --> 03:28:03,120
[SPEAKER_21]: So anyway, that's what makes sense.

1987
03:28:03,160 --> 03:28:06,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Christie, I know you had unmuted before.

1988
03:28:06,162 --> 03:28:08,763
[SPEAKER_19]: I may have more questions than I have.

1989
03:28:09,868 --> 03:28:10,489
[SPEAKER_19]: suggestions.

1990
03:28:10,549 --> 03:28:18,634
[SPEAKER_19]: But my first question to Ryan was how do you know how much of the original house is intact?

1991
03:28:18,895 --> 03:28:29,442
[SPEAKER_19]: You did mention that there had been maybe some renovations to it over the years, but I'm just wondering if you know how much of the original remains.

1992
03:28:32,028 --> 03:28:38,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so I don't want to put a percentage to it, but we did a walkthrough during the demo delay hearings.

1993
03:28:39,973 --> 03:28:46,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And based on what I could see, so the original, maybe 1810, 184, 1810 structure with its original center hearth.

1994
03:28:52,780 --> 03:28:57,022
[SPEAKER_07]: and the staircase alignments and, you know, framing are intact.

1995
03:28:57,543 --> 03:29:01,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Then there's a second rear L from, you know, that's very early.

1996
03:29:01,504 --> 03:29:05,266
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably 1820s that went on after that building.

1997
03:29:05,706 --> 03:29:16,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of those finishes in both the front and the rear were probably replaced at some point in the 1860s, 1870s with lath and plaster, but that's all under

1998
03:29:17,472 --> 03:29:23,077
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that's all under later, I would say, paneling from like the 1960s or 70s.

1999
03:29:23,157 --> 03:29:23,918
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been painted.

2000
03:29:23,938 --> 03:29:26,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the building was occupied up until two years ago.

2001
03:29:26,801 --> 03:29:33,767
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, there's examples of other buildings that we've found, you know, several layers of history on.

2002
03:29:33,967 --> 03:29:38,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't say that the buildings probably, you know, of original

2003
03:29:39,092 --> 03:29:40,694
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's probably 50% there.

2004
03:29:40,714 --> 03:29:47,580
[SPEAKER_07]: The framing makes up 50% of the building and then the later finishes that are important in their own right probably make up maybe another 25%.

2005
03:29:48,081 --> 03:29:50,183
[SPEAKER_07]: It's lost its windows and doors.

2006
03:29:50,583 --> 03:29:53,726
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some original features like that in the house.

2007
03:29:54,607 --> 03:29:57,029
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's been, you know, it's been modernized over time.

2008
03:29:58,010 --> 03:29:59,772
[SPEAKER_07]: But the key thing here that we're really

2009
03:30:00,595 --> 03:30:10,741
[SPEAKER_07]: stressing, and we've always stressed in the beginning, you know, we're hoping to preserve, you know, the building in the context of a redevelopment, but that wasn't even explored for the homeowner.

2010
03:30:10,821 --> 03:30:21,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we understand that it needs to change, you know, we saw that tonight a little bit, you know, but there's enough there to warrant integrity and to warrant the demo delay.

2011
03:30:22,828 --> 03:30:29,893
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I was just curious if you were to put a priority on, I mean, is it more about the architectural

2012
03:30:32,136 --> 03:30:36,998
[SPEAKER_19]: features of the home or the history that it represents.

2013
03:30:37,598 --> 03:30:57,346
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know, I'm not really sure where I'm going with this, but, you know, so just thinking like in that area, it seems to me a little odd just to, I understand, you know, what you're getting at and what your objectives are, but it seems a little odd to me to just create that as,

2014
03:30:58,942 --> 03:31:25,317
[SPEAKER_19]: a historic district, that single lot where I think we have to look at where we are in present day and balance the tension between historic preservation or educating our residents about our history and allowing important housing and redevelopment to move forward that is appropriate.

2015
03:31:28,488 --> 03:31:30,810
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess I don't really have any answers.

2016
03:31:30,870 --> 03:31:34,613
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm just sort of thinking out loud, because it is a challenging issue.

2017
03:31:34,653 --> 03:31:43,941
[SPEAKER_19]: But I sort of like where Clace was going about, is there an option to relocate it to a more appropriate location?

2018
03:31:44,281 --> 03:31:57,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Or is there mitigation somehow that can be negotiated with the homeowner to incorporate some historic elements, maybe not the entire house, but

2019
03:31:58,410 --> 03:32:08,796
[SPEAKER_19]: information or a plaque or history or photographic evidence of the home are something in writing about the history.

2020
03:32:11,278 --> 03:32:19,043
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't really have much else to say, but I don't know if I can personally support just blanketly

2021
03:32:21,802 --> 03:32:28,764
[SPEAKER_19]: recommending that that lot be its own historic district, considering other factors around housing development.

2022
03:32:29,764 --> 03:32:30,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Portato?

2023
03:32:31,985 --> 03:32:39,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to figure out, at one point when this house was for sale, it says it was just a building for sale, not the land.

2024
03:32:39,747 --> 03:32:48,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And the option that was mentioned previously by Andre and Clace is for the seller, the new owner, had to have a lot in which it could

2025
03:32:49,822 --> 03:32:56,289
[SPEAKER_12]: could be moved to properly, but the previous owner would pay for that, pay for the installation of this house to move.

2026
03:32:56,329 --> 03:32:58,451
[SPEAKER_12]: So at what point did we change from that?

2027
03:32:58,471 --> 03:33:02,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it was actually listed as such.

2028
03:33:02,496 --> 03:33:03,076
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it was 2018, 2019.

2029
03:33:03,377 --> 03:33:05,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if it's the current owner.

2030
03:33:05,499 --> 03:33:09,043
[SPEAKER_12]: But at some point, this was a listing for this development.

2031
03:33:09,623 --> 03:33:10,905
[SPEAKER_12]: How did we move away from that?

2032
03:33:13,268 --> 03:33:21,776
[SPEAKER_07]: It was put on after we moved this process forward and in the last, what, 30 days?

2033
03:33:21,836 --> 03:33:26,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure, but it's definitely, it's just an offer and he's never presented to us.

2034
03:33:27,948 --> 03:33:29,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been listed twice.

2035
03:33:30,670 --> 03:33:41,757
[SPEAKER_07]: When we gave him the original list of options, we asked him to first pursue reuse of the existing building to demonstrate to us that it was technically infeasible.

2036
03:33:42,097 --> 03:33:47,561
[SPEAKER_07]: But instead, he just listed the building for sale available for $1 to see if anybody would want it.

2037
03:33:47,701 --> 03:33:49,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was on there for a handful of days.

2038
03:33:50,929 --> 03:34:08,015
[SPEAKER_07]: I he never provided any documentation that he received offers or received inquiries You know, there's you know, there's a ton of miscommunications and no communications here that you know That again, we our hands are tied.

2039
03:34:08,055 --> 03:34:19,659
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't generate that information We can't help him move forward with the demo delay if none of that information is being provided to us you know, so we we and again communications broke down where

2040
03:34:20,346 --> 03:34:24,947
[SPEAKER_07]: he, the homeowner, sorry, the homeowner just stopped communicating.

2041
03:34:24,987 --> 03:34:30,188
[SPEAKER_07]: He said that he's not going to entertain any idea, any reuse of the existing building or any analysis thereof.

2042
03:34:30,688 --> 03:34:36,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And now here, 16 months later at city council meeting, he provided that information to us.

2043
03:34:37,590 --> 03:34:46,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas he could have done that 16 months ago and we wouldn't even be here, but you know, we're using the only tool available to us to move the dialogue forward.

2044
03:34:46,272 --> 03:34:47,652
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all.

2045
03:34:49,270 --> 03:34:52,232
[SPEAKER_19]: So the- Can I ask another question?

2046
03:34:52,472 --> 03:35:06,542
[SPEAKER_19]: Like one of our first, well, one of the first board meetings that I attended, didn't we have a proposal before us about building, you know, two houses on one lot?

2047
03:35:06,822 --> 03:35:13,747
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, has that, and one of them was to allow a second home on a lot where it preserves a historic home.

2048
03:35:13,767 --> 03:35:17,250
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, is that something that was discussed with this

2049
03:35:18,367 --> 03:35:20,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it depends on the zoning.

2050
03:35:21,391 --> 03:35:25,116
[SPEAKER_14]: The zoning laws for this area is different.

2051
03:35:25,597 --> 03:35:26,778
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a different district.

2052
03:35:27,920 --> 03:35:33,027
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's more dense apartment development allowed in this zone.

2053
03:35:33,808 --> 03:35:34,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.

2054
03:35:34,927 --> 03:35:39,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we were definitely open to building another single family residence.

2055
03:35:39,371 --> 03:35:42,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's apartment to zoning, so he can build several units by right.

2056
03:35:43,214 --> 03:35:47,818
[SPEAKER_07]: He says, or his attorney says, we're not opposed to that by any means.

2057
03:35:47,878 --> 03:35:54,984
[SPEAKER_07]: We definitely are, if he can do it by right and he can provide housing to the city, we definitely want that to happen.

2058
03:35:57,225 --> 03:36:02,546
[SPEAKER_07]: He, you know, he, he, he continuously says he can't do one thing and has no evidence to back it up.

2059
03:36:02,886 --> 03:36:08,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So we, we can't make a decision to help him or, you know, to help move the process forward.

2060
03:36:08,807 --> 03:36:13,128
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just, we have to look at reusing the existing building at that point.

2061
03:36:13,708 --> 03:36:15,589
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, you know, and stick with that.

2062
03:36:15,629 --> 03:36:19,549
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, two of the architects that are on the board said that it can be done.

2063
03:36:19,569 --> 03:36:23,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we know that it requires renovation and repair and, you know, we

2064
03:36:24,087 --> 03:36:39,652
[SPEAKER_07]: talked a lot, you know, earlier tonight about, you know, possibly reusing a portion of the building, maybe the oldest portion, but, um, you know, none of those options have been explored and the owner was unwilling, you know, in a flat out letter, he just said, we're not entertaining any options to reuse this building period.

2065
03:36:40,132 --> 03:36:42,053
[SPEAKER_07]: So our hands were tied at that point.

2066
03:36:42,073 --> 03:36:47,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like I said, this is the only option available to us to move the discussion forward.

2067
03:36:47,635 --> 03:36:48,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we're not trying to.

2068
03:36:49,495 --> 03:37:04,649
[SPEAKER_07]: heard the development here, we're trying to encourage design that's compatible with the neighborhood, that helps the city, that gets tax rolls, that he makes money on, you know, there's definitely a balance here that's trying to take place, you know, and I can definitely understand everyone's concerns.

2069
03:37:05,210 --> 03:37:13,658
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I enjoy hearing everyone's point of view, because I think it's important that we take it all in and then just try to come to a consensus that works for everybody.

2070
03:37:16,831 --> 03:37:27,915
[SPEAKER_12]: As has been said earlier, I'm not sure that I can even recommend or even provide anything on this situation outside of having it transferred.

2071
03:37:28,475 --> 03:37:32,797
[SPEAKER_12]: And it sounds like that's not an option with the owner anymore, although it was at one point.

2072
03:37:32,817 --> 03:37:40,740
[SPEAKER_12]: I wouldn't know how to move forward with this, to be absolutely honest, outside of transferring.

2073
03:37:41,735 --> 03:37:43,676
[SPEAKER_14]: So just a couple of questions, Ryan.

2074
03:37:44,036 --> 03:37:47,557
[SPEAKER_14]: The demolition delay is going to end at the end of October.

2075
03:37:47,597 --> 03:37:48,177
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

2076
03:37:49,517 --> 03:37:50,277
[SPEAKER_07]: October 8th.

2077
03:37:51,158 --> 03:37:51,478
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

2078
03:37:52,258 --> 03:38:02,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And just so everybody on the board understands, the city council actually had a committee of the whole hearing tonight at the same time we were meeting.

2079
03:38:02,441 --> 03:38:04,161
[SPEAKER_14]: And they had this on their agenda.

2080
03:38:08,324 --> 03:38:17,000
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know what they discussed and talked about, except Ryan, I don't know if you could go into any more detail about if there was anything productive from that conversation.

2081
03:38:18,949 --> 03:38:21,352
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we heard both sides of the story.

2082
03:38:21,372 --> 03:38:26,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I gave the presentation on the history of the building and historic districts.

2083
03:38:27,837 --> 03:38:34,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Ari and the owner and you know his team gave the gave some drawings and some information to City Council.

2084
03:38:35,104 --> 03:38:38,887
[SPEAKER_07]: There was some public input and then at the end of the meeting they elected to do two things.

2085
03:38:38,927 --> 03:38:40,088
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to have a site visit.

2086
03:38:40,508 --> 03:38:48,933
[SPEAKER_07]: on Monday just to review the building, and on Tuesday voted to move the paper out of committee to be on the agenda next Tuesday for a vote of approval.

2087
03:38:48,953 --> 03:38:54,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2088
03:38:56,957 --> 03:39:05,142
[SPEAKER_14]: And did the property owner give any different indication tonight about being willing to explore creative options?

2089
03:39:07,632 --> 03:39:15,876
[SPEAKER_07]: No, his position, you know, I know I'm coming from the position to try to defend the city, so I'll try to relate it as best as I can.

2090
03:39:16,256 --> 03:39:27,941
[SPEAKER_07]: His position is that it's technically unfeasible to renovate this building, and, you know, he provided structural information and drawings and photos, and we have always understood that, but we, you know, the

2091
03:39:29,882 --> 03:39:42,450
[SPEAKER_07]: we were asking him to be a little bit more creative and come up with some information that would allow us to at least pursue other paths that involve the new building, but he wasn't willing to do that.

2092
03:39:42,490 --> 03:39:47,693
[SPEAKER_07]: But he did that tonight, not for us, but for city council at the presentations.

2093
03:39:47,753 --> 03:39:56,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was very schematic, but his position has not changed that, obviously his plan is to either get rid of the building or demolish the building.

2094
03:39:57,559 --> 03:39:59,621
[SPEAKER_07]: rather than try to make any attempt to preserve it.

2095
03:39:59,741 --> 03:40:04,004
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the listing of the building is an act of good faith.

2096
03:40:04,064 --> 03:40:11,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just an act to demonstrate that he's doing something to move this process along, perhaps in his favor.

2097
03:40:11,388 --> 03:40:22,696
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just, you know, I think the, you know, some of the Councilors obviously relayed that, you know, we didn't have the time to review any of that information and that he didn't respond to any of our requests.

2098
03:40:23,300 --> 03:40:24,902
[SPEAKER_07]: know, for that information in the beginning.

2099
03:40:25,002 --> 03:40:29,267
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's just his position hasn't really changed.

2100
03:40:30,768 --> 03:40:38,296
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the final thing I would say, just brainstorming here, this is, the property is adjacent to LaPreeze Village, the

2101
03:40:39,473 --> 03:40:42,835
[SPEAKER_14]: the affordable housing project that I believe is owned by the city.

2102
03:40:43,775 --> 03:40:58,902
[SPEAKER_14]: And has there been any conversation about possibly the city purchasing the property and using some CPA funds for affordable housing and historic preservation to basically do the development itself?

2103
03:41:02,464 --> 03:41:03,665
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's a good idea, though.

2104
03:41:03,745 --> 03:41:06,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I did broach the idea of perhaps doing a land swap

2105
03:41:09,241 --> 03:41:23,534
[SPEAKER_07]: with the housing authority owning the property across the street that it would give the developer the opportunity to build on the same square footage and the same lot size.

2106
03:41:23,554 --> 03:41:34,965
[SPEAKER_07]: They're both 13,000 square feet in exchange that the housing authority could team up with the historical commission and yes, get the renovation of the building and perhaps the housing authority

2107
03:41:35,525 --> 03:41:41,087
[SPEAKER_07]: authority could use the land at the rear either for public housing or, you know, they wanted to build a community center.

2108
03:41:41,107 --> 03:41:45,448
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where that stood for that village, but that was another option.

2109
03:41:46,469 --> 03:41:57,152
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I, and the big question is, would Ari even sell or, you know, knowing that the delay is looming, you know, or could the city afford to purchase that property from him?

2110
03:41:57,789 --> 03:41:58,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, to prevent the demolition.

2111
03:41:58,969 --> 03:42:00,310
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those are all good ideas.

2112
03:42:00,350 --> 03:42:09,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, you know, I, I broached the idea and, you know, it seemed, you know, I was told to ask the question, so it's working through, but, you know, those are complicated matters.

2113
03:42:09,093 --> 03:42:17,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that would, that would definitely take some time, but, you know, I, I think if the city could acquire that land, I think they definitely could and should do something with it.

2114
03:42:17,877 --> 03:42:21,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, even adding it to the lacrosse village, I think that's, you know.

2115
03:42:22,458 --> 03:42:23,219
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be nifty.

2116
03:42:24,059 --> 03:42:25,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus it's near the schools.

2117
03:42:25,179 --> 03:42:34,963
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it has, you know, we could use the building for something, you know, maybe it's used for the village sometimes, and maybe it's used for students for teaching about the history, you know.

2118
03:42:35,183 --> 03:42:44,347
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, right now I'm just focused on even getting the building standing to hopefully be able to continue that dialogue at this point.

2119
03:42:46,880 --> 03:42:59,422
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, it's really, it's a tough call, I think, for us coming in last minute to weigh in on something like this, which is, it's a challenge, I think.

2120
03:43:00,663 --> 03:43:05,223
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I guess I'll throw it back to all of you board members.

2121
03:43:06,624 --> 03:43:09,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have strong feelings one way or the other?

2122
03:43:09,904 --> 03:43:13,085
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not required to make a recommendation, so we could do,

2123
03:43:15,176 --> 03:43:20,237
[SPEAKER_14]: what I'll call the class solution of making no recommendation is also a possibility.

2124
03:43:23,738 --> 03:43:26,779
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the will of the board?

2125
03:43:27,939 --> 03:43:29,320
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm hugely conflicted.

2126
03:43:29,980 --> 03:43:35,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Preservation of any property is always a great thing, but it can have negative consequences later.

2127
03:43:35,161 --> 03:43:43,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Taking something out of stock for the use of all, I'm just not in a position where I feel as though

2128
03:43:44,143 --> 03:43:51,588
[SPEAKER_12]: myself as a board member should even rule on this as put forth.

2129
03:43:52,849 --> 03:44:04,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I'm all for preservation, but at the same time, taking something offline and hindering use from others, I have a huge problem with that too.

2130
03:44:04,377 --> 03:44:10,962
[SPEAKER_21]: So Andre, just to be clear, are we able to say that we don't have a recommendation?

2131
03:44:12,083 --> 03:44:12,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2132
03:44:13,290 --> 03:44:14,131
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my understanding.

2133
03:44:14,671 --> 03:44:18,013
[SPEAKER_14]: And Annie or Alicia, you can feel free to weigh in on that.

2134
03:44:20,275 --> 03:44:22,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, you guys can make a recommendation.

2135
03:44:23,257 --> 03:44:26,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I make a motion?

2136
03:44:26,239 --> 03:44:27,640
[SPEAKER_14]: You can make a motion.

2137
03:44:27,660 --> 03:44:41,930
[SPEAKER_21]: I make a motion that we do not make a recommendation on this, but encourage the

2138
03:44:43,756 --> 03:44:52,818
[SPEAKER_21]: rethinking of this project in different ways and in an active dialogue with the owner.

2139
03:44:56,679 --> 03:44:57,679
[SPEAKER_21]: Does that work?

2140
03:44:58,759 --> 03:44:59,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me see if we can.

2141
03:45:00,859 --> 03:45:12,902
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think there's a motion to make no recommendation on the historic district, which is the specific piece in front of us, but to encourage

2142
03:45:13,723 --> 03:45:20,145
[SPEAKER_21]: the preservation of this building, either on this site or a different site.

2143
03:45:24,607 --> 03:45:37,932
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's to encourage the parties involved to pursue preservation of the historic structure on this site or another site.

2144
03:45:39,312 --> 03:45:40,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Andre, this is Dave.

2145
03:45:40,353 --> 03:45:41,153
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll second that.

2146
03:45:42,421 --> 03:45:44,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we have a motion, we have a second.

2147
03:45:46,604 --> 03:45:48,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Any comments before we move to a roll call?

2148
03:45:52,829 --> 03:45:56,272
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, then we move to a roll call.

2149
03:45:56,712 --> 03:45:57,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Clyce Andresen?

2150
03:45:58,974 --> 03:45:59,074
Aye.

2151
03:45:59,915 --> 03:46:00,615
[SPEAKER_14]: David Blumberg?

2152
03:46:01,656 --> 03:46:01,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2153
03:46:02,677 --> 03:46:03,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Deanna Pubety?

2154
03:46:04,338 --> 03:46:04,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

2155
03:46:05,059 --> 03:46:05,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Katie McHugh?

2156
03:46:06,560 --> 03:46:06,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

2157
03:46:07,281 --> 03:46:07,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Christy Dowd?

2158
03:46:09,002 --> 03:46:09,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

2159
03:46:09,843 --> 03:46:10,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Jackie Furtado?

2160
03:46:11,324 --> 03:46:11,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

2161
03:46:12,167 --> 03:46:13,347
[SPEAKER_14]: and I'm an I as well.

2162
03:46:13,367 --> 03:46:16,208
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

2163
03:46:17,789 --> 03:46:25,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And I realized that you guys have done a ton of work on this and good luck fighting the fight.

2164
03:46:25,811 --> 03:46:34,753
[SPEAKER_14]: If there's any creative brainstorming ideas we can help out with informally, I think their members would be happy to do that.

2165
03:46:38,434 --> 03:46:40,555
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see, I think the city council will

2166
03:46:41,588 --> 03:46:45,513
[SPEAKER_14]: probably make a decision regardless of what our recommendation is.

2167
03:46:46,594 --> 03:46:51,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we definitely want you guys to play a bigger role.

2168
03:46:52,021 --> 03:46:58,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Some things came up and we're just working through the channels here, but there are other districts in the works.

2169
03:46:58,869 --> 03:47:01,232
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one for the full length of forestry.

2170
03:47:01,792 --> 03:47:15,924
[SPEAKER_07]: that we definitely want you guys to review and have time to give us feedback so that we can, you know, work with the homeowners and the owners there and, you know, have something that perhaps is a little bit less contentious on both sides.

2171
03:47:15,964 --> 03:47:20,768
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we have the support of owners and renters and neighbors there, so that would be a little bit better.

2172
03:47:20,788 --> 03:47:28,314
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you guys definitely play an important role in our city, so we want you guys to have your feedback and the more minds that, the more minds, the merrier.

2173
03:47:29,252 --> 03:47:29,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

2174
03:47:29,512 --> 03:47:29,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2175
03:47:29,912 --> 03:47:37,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're, you know, I think we're trying to move in a direction where we can function more as a proactive planning board.

2176
03:47:37,355 --> 03:47:58,203
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we'll be doing more of that over the next few months and would love to work with both of the commissions, the historic district commission, as well as the historic commission on trying to identify our priority historic assets in the city and how we can incorporate that into the preservation plan

2177
03:47:58,905 --> 03:47:59,505
[SPEAKER_14]: while we grow.

2178
03:48:00,506 --> 03:48:10,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, one of the things that the Councilor Marks offered for BPAPR tonight was to analyze the funding for a community-wide preservation plan.

2179
03:48:11,011 --> 03:48:13,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that that would definitely help.

2180
03:48:13,913 --> 03:48:27,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we did, we can use the survey work that we do to at least analyze the properties and use all the good data that we've gotten over the last decade to help you guys plan and give you all this good information that's out there too.

2181
03:48:29,996 --> 03:48:39,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I think there are maybe other ways to, you know, regardless of the outcome on this particular property, I think the shipyard history is very important and interesting.

2182
03:48:39,223 --> 03:48:49,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think there could be some, you know, we've lost a lot of stuff, unfortunately, but there could be some interesting ways of celebrating that history so that more people in the city will know it.

2183
03:48:52,054 --> 03:48:52,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, sounds good.

2184
03:48:53,535 --> 03:48:54,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, best of luck.

2185
03:48:54,616 --> 03:48:54,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck.

2186
03:48:55,096 --> 03:48:55,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2187
03:48:55,497 --> 03:48:56,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all.

2188
03:48:56,698 --> 03:48:57,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we'll be in touch again.

2189
03:48:58,699 --> 03:48:59,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, everyone.

2190
03:49:00,064 --> 03:49:00,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2191
03:49:02,446 --> 03:49:07,970
[SPEAKER_14]: So board members, we've come to the end of our agenda.

2192
03:49:08,531 --> 03:49:11,793
[SPEAKER_14]: We just need to set dates for our next meeting.

2193
03:49:12,494 --> 03:49:25,684
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I'd like to do is see if we could, I think Deanna said that she had a preference for September 30th between September 30th and October 1st.

2194
03:49:26,545 --> 03:49:26,965
[SPEAKER_14]: So if that,

2195
03:49:27,607 --> 03:49:30,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody know that they can't make September 30th?

2196
03:49:30,668 --> 03:49:33,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, great.

2197
03:49:33,928 --> 03:49:36,949
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll go ahead and set September 30th as the next date.

2198
03:49:37,389 --> 03:49:40,189
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after that, let's try to look ahead a little bit.

2199
03:49:40,289 --> 03:49:48,071
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think Annie and I were talking about just two weeks, every two weeks after that for the next few weeks.

2200
03:49:48,111 --> 03:49:50,771
[SPEAKER_14]: So October 14th and October 28th.

2201
03:49:50,871 --> 03:49:53,932
[SPEAKER_14]: So those will both be Wednesdays at 6 p.m.

2202
03:49:57,542 --> 03:50:01,764
[SPEAKER_14]: any conflicts that you guys know about right now on those dates?

2203
03:50:04,606 --> 03:50:06,907
[SPEAKER_20]: And we may not need all of those.

2204
03:50:07,147 --> 03:50:11,589
[SPEAKER_20]: And we can be in touch about canceling them if there aren't enough agenda items.

2205
03:50:11,729 --> 03:50:21,654
[SPEAKER_20]: But we wanted to give you guys an opportunity to do some items that were not as statutorily required and as some of the development review we've been doing.

2206
03:50:22,255 --> 03:50:22,955
[SPEAKER_20]: Ideas are welcome.

2207
03:50:23,801 --> 03:50:24,241
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

2208
03:50:24,721 --> 03:50:30,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Comprehensive plan is going to get advertised next Wednesday and therefore released.

2209
03:50:31,363 --> 03:50:35,964
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I think we're setting October 23rd as the date that RFPs are due back.

2210
03:50:37,825 --> 03:50:45,607
[SPEAKER_18]: And as I had mentioned in email, that we could look at doing design review settings.

2211
03:50:46,587 --> 03:50:46,967
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

2212
03:50:47,367 --> 03:50:49,028
[SPEAKER_18]: I said it correctly in the email.

2213
03:50:49,208 --> 03:50:50,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Design guidelines.

2214
03:50:50,468 --> 03:50:50,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2215
03:50:50,988 --> 03:50:52,109
[SPEAKER_14]: Design guidelines.

2216
03:50:52,969 --> 03:50:53,169
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

2217
03:50:54,139 --> 03:50:58,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think that would be a good discussion point.

2218
03:50:59,102 --> 03:51:08,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if it's not to the level of design guidelines, I think we had talked in the past about there are certain comments that we time and again talk to developers about.

2219
03:51:08,747 --> 03:51:15,651
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think articulating what we expect from developers in terms of presentation materials would be one thing.

2220
03:51:16,091 --> 03:51:20,173
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also, what's our checklist in terms of things that we continue to go down, right?

2221
03:51:22,557 --> 03:51:26,319
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, trash removal, bike parking, blah, blah, blah, all those things.

2222
03:51:26,639 --> 03:51:43,830
[SPEAKER_18]: In preparation for a meeting like that, we have a checklist that goes out to people when they want to submit to us, like, here's the requirements, and we'll send that out to you, you know, the blank one, and people can start to look at it, and we can look at what's codified,

2223
03:51:44,450 --> 03:51:50,574
[SPEAKER_18]: what's in our regulations versus ordinances, things that are in our regulations, this board can review.

2224
03:51:51,214 --> 03:51:57,278
[SPEAKER_18]: Another thing I'd like to put on the table is that in the ordinance, it says that we would review linkage fees every three years.

2225
03:51:57,758 --> 03:52:07,704
[SPEAKER_18]: And we are still operating with the original linkage fees set in 1991, I believe, even though it's said, and I don't think they've ever been reviewed.

2226
03:52:08,345 --> 03:52:10,246
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are some examples of things that have,

2227
03:52:11,048 --> 03:52:14,410
[SPEAKER_18]: that we'd like to discuss need to be in a public open meeting?

2228
03:52:15,810 --> 03:52:21,513
[SPEAKER_14]: So good news is the pipeline going forward looks a lot less.

2229
03:52:22,934 --> 03:52:29,237
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can be proactive and talk about some things that might be a little bit more interesting for us to deal with.

2230
03:52:30,842 --> 03:52:34,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll talk to Annie and Alicia about what some of those items might be.

2231
03:52:34,304 --> 03:52:44,028
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have thoughts about things that you would like to talk about as a board, please send those to me or the CD staff.

2232
03:52:44,949 --> 03:52:51,592
[SPEAKER_14]: And our goal going forward is to really try to limit these meetings to two hours if we can.

2233
03:52:56,834 --> 03:52:58,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Great, well, is there a motion to adjourn?

2234
03:53:00,732 --> 03:53:01,272
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll make a motion.

2235
03:53:02,533 --> 03:53:03,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Jackie.

2236
03:53:03,974 --> 03:53:04,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Second?

2237
03:53:04,274 --> 03:53:06,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll second.

2238
03:53:06,736 --> 03:53:07,316
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, class.

2239
03:53:08,017 --> 03:53:08,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote.

2240
03:53:08,857 --> 03:53:09,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Class Andreessen?

2241
03:53:10,378 --> 03:53:10,498
Aye.

2242
03:53:11,079 --> 03:53:11,699
