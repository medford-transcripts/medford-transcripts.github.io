    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=0.217s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1.218s">My</a>  name is Andre LaRue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2.419s">I'm</a>  the chair of the Medford Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5.462s">Thanks</a>  for joining us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=6.563s">I</a>  hope you are all well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=10.027s">Pursuant</a>  to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law, Chapter 30A, Section 18, and the Governor's March 15, 2020 order, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=20.499s">imposing</a>  strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=24.32s">This</a>  hearing of the Medford Community Development Board will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=31.162s">Specific</a>  information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members of the public and or parties with a right and or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the city of Medford website at www.medfordma.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=45.037s">With</a>  this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=51.641s">No</a>  in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings in real time via technological means. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=61.826s">In</a>  the event that we are unable to do so despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or Medford Community Media website an audio or video recording, transcript, or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=76.385s">Due</a>  to streaming conflicts with other city meetings tonight, this meeting will not be streaming live on a community access cable, but members of the public may access the proceedings in real time via Zoom, and a recording of the full meeting will be posted on the Medford Community Media website after the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=97.382s">Just</a>  a reminder for everyone, to participate during the meeting, questions and comments may be emailed to OCD at Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=106.085s">MA.gov</a>  or at, excuse me, OCD at Medford-MA.gov or submitted via phone to 781-393-2480. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=120.082s">All</a>  votes will be roll call votes and please introduce yourself before speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=130.612s">The</a>  first item on the agenda tonight is approval of the minutes of the meeting of August 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=136.137s">Those</a>  minutes were not finalized in time for tonight, so we will table those to our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=145.786s">Brings</a>  us to our continued public hearing for 278 Middlesex Ave, BJ's Gas. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=153.153s">Let</a>  me just get that public hearing notice.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=226.951s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=228.332s">Andre,</a>  just before you read the announcement for BJ's, I just wanted to announce, just to remind <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=234.799s">the</a>  board and the public that I recused myself from review of this project last time due to a potential conflict of interest with Stantec, the firm that I work with providing environmental consulting and engineering for the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=249.751s">So</a>  again, I will recuse myself from this item on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=254.175s">And</a>  I will mute and stop my video for that portion of the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=261.281s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=264.132s">And</a>  Katie, you were not in attendance last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=269.076s">So</a>  could you also just state for the record that you have watched and listened to the recording from August 20th?</p>

    <p>[8oEn2KkMIiU_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=277.862s">Yes,</a>  I was not in attendance on August 20th, but I have watched and listened to and reviewed the recording from the August 20th meeting.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=285.848s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=286.569s">You've</a>  also submitted written confirmation of such to the Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=295.117s">So</a>  this is a continuation of the hearing that opened on June 18, 2020 and was continued last month to tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=303.16s">The</a>  Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, June 18, 2020 at 6.45 PM via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a special permit slash site plan review application submitted by BJ's Wholesale Club to construct a self-service fueling station within a portion of the existing parking area at 278 and 0 Middlesex Avenue and allowed use in an industrial zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=326.316s">The</a>  site is currently occupied by an existing BJ's Wholesale Club with associated surface parking and site improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=333.021s">The</a>  proposed facility will be comprised of a more or less 200 square foot kiosk slash gasoline attendant facility with canopy more or less 4,525 square feet and a six dispenser service pump island. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=347.116s">A</a>  copy of the application may be viewed in the office of community development room 308 from the city's website at <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=353.743s">www.medfordma.org</a>  slash departments slash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=366.533s">At</a>  this time, I would like to ask the applicant represented by Mark Vaughan to present any revisions and updates to the plans.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=377.16s">Yes,</a>  good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=380.102s">Pleasure</a>  to be before you again this evening in this virtual setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=384.105s">I</a>  hope you're all doing well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=386.006s">So</a>  I do not have a lot to say this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=390.068s">I'm</a>  sure you'll be pleased to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=392.25s">I</a>  know that we've had, I think this is our fourth hearing with you and certainly appreciate all the input, time, and attention that the board has put on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=402.216s">And</a>  I think it's resulted in a much better plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=407.537s">What</a>  I thought might be helpful, just given that it's been a month since we appeared before you, and also with the board member who I know, board member McHugh, having listened to the tape, I thought it might be helpful if I just had Austin Turner, our engineer, engineering, and Sean Kelly very briefly just summarize again the modifications that have been made to the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=431.221s">that</a>  we're seeking approval of and have before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=434.883s">I'm</a>  not gonna give a summary of what the project is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=436.944s">I</a>  think everyone on the board understands it at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=440.005s">The</a>  only thing I will add is just to remind the board, we did submit back in June how, in our opinion, the project does comply and satisfy the various site plan special permit standards that are set forth in your zoning bylaw. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=457.04s">I</a>  think in as much as we felt that the project, as it was comprised then, met all the criteria, I think even more so now, just given the additional modifications, additional landscaping, traffic improvements and the like that we have made. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=472.747s">So</a>  appreciate your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=474.808s">And</a>  if the board is so willing, I'd like to turn it over to Austin to just briefly walk through and summarize the changes that we've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=483.525s">and</a>  a couple of other tweaks to the plan since the last meeting in August, including the elimination of the dumpster, which we can explain, as well as some EV parking, car charging stations spaces, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=498.079s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=501.602s">Thank</a>  you, Mark, and good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=504.537s">Austin</a>  Turner with Bowler. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=505.678s">And</a>  what I'll do is just as Mark mentioned, I'll give you just a quick recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=509.639s">It's</a>  been a month and talk about how the project has evolved just quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=515.18s">And</a>  some of the recent updates that we had introduced subsequent to our prior discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=520.802s">And</a>  with that, I was gonna share my screen if somebody could authorize me to do such things that would be standing.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=542.349s">Sorry,</a>  Annie's the only one who has the ability to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=546.752s">And</a>  she seems to be having a network problem.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=554.017s">It</a>  might have worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=554.757s">It</a>  just popped up on my screen and said he was co-host, I think.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=559.08s">It</a>  just worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=559.801s">Yeah,</a>  it just came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=561.022s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=567.166s">OK,</a>  everybody see that all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=572.653s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=573.995s">So</a>  you're probably familiar with this, this exhibit, we had used this to kind of summarize the global changes that have been made to the project, which I'll quickly summarize again, I'll go on kind of an encounter clockwise fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=587.426s">starting</a>  big picture, and Sean will summarize this again as well, through our conversations with the board and the feedback we've received, the product is agreeing to introduce the bike lanes and the re-striping on Middlesex Avenue that we had discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=605.782s">Obviously,</a>  we have to make sure that DOT is in agreement with that as well, but to the extent that they are, the applicant is agreeing to <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=614.55s">construct</a>  nearly 1300 feet of bike lane improvements and off-site improvements in Middlesex Avenue, which we thought was a fairly big benefit, both the community and a nice add that the project was willing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=629.577s">Related</a>  to that, as you kind of get more into the project frontage, we have been able to provide some reduction in width of the driveway out onto Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=641.65s">With</a>  that is going to come sidewalk improvements along the frontage of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=646.214s">The</a>  sidewalk that's located here will be reconstructed and brought into current accessibility compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=656.11s">Also,</a>  in the vein of pedestrian connectivity, we have incorporated into the site plans a pedestrian connection from the pedestrian sidewalk on Middlesex Avenue to the front door of the existing BJ's Club, which is going to be located along, I'm going to call it the top of the property, but as you can see my cursor tracing here, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=677.177s">that</a>  sidewalk will be located on what is currently parking lot, but will be along that frontage and provides a direct connection from the sidewalk on Middlesex Avenue to the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=690.277s">As</a>  we're continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=693.246s">to</a>  advance into the site plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=694.667s">Some</a>  of the changes that we have introduced from the initial application was the inclusion of a very large landscape island immediately adjacent to the canopy and the fueling position. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=705.413s">That</a>  was done as a direct result of some feedback by members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=710.476s">We</a>  originally, if you recall, had a driveway in that location. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=714.183s">And</a>  that driveway, there was some discussion about that driveway or the fear that that driveway may present some potential conflict for turning movements. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=722.329s">In</a>  consideration of that, we just removed it and made it a large landscaped island. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=728.255s">And</a>  similarly, we're adding a number of different landscape islands interior to the property, including some enhancement of the screening between the project and Woodruff Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=742.722s">It</a>  looked like historically some of that vegetation hasn't survived, and it looks like it may have been compromised at some point in the past as a result of some utility work. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=751.446s">With</a>  that in mind, this project is proposing to kind of reestablish <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=755.888s">reestablish</a>  the vegetative buffer along Woodruff Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=761.673s">As</a>  Mark had mentioned, we're also proposing the inclusion of electrical vehicle charging spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=771.065s">And</a>  those spaces, as you can see, this is kind of the overall site plan view, but those spaces are going to be located in this general hatched area over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=780.052s">So</a>  BJ's has been able to provide those. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=783.575s">They've</a>  reached an agreement with a provider for that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=788.078s">And</a>  that is part of this program that we're proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=791.14s">Last</a>  month, we had told you that we were pretty close to being able to commit to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=795.444s">And</a>  as of this evening, we are able to fully commit to the installation of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=800.107s">for</a>  EV charging stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=803.651s">One</a>  other item too that was discussed at our last meeting was the removal and or relocation <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=812.593s">of</a>  the trash enclosure. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=815.374s">And</a>  if you recall, originally the trash enclosure was generally located in this corner in proximate to Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=822.578s">We</a>  had worked with the BJ's operations team on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=825.399s">And</a>  what we were originally considering was relocating it further interior to the property and into that large new landscaped island that we had added. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=834.19s">And</a>  what we found actually is operationally and with the fact that this station is located within the parking lot of an existing club, we're actually eliminating it altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=844.358s">So</a>  what will happen is the existing enclosures and existing trash facilities associated with the club will be used <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=851.363s">to</a>  collect the trash for the receptacles that are out here and how that works essentially is the attendant will be responsible for maintaining those trash enclosures on a daily basis or is not as needed basis will remove that trash and then bring it to the facilities that are inside the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=866.914s">So</a>  what that does is affords us the opportunity just to remove the enclosure altogether with it being proximate to Middlesex Avenue <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=873.759s">we</a>  understood that there was some concern about the aesthetic of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=876.08s">And</a>  so with that in mind, we've just removed it altogether and operationally from BJ's perspective, that is fine and consistent with some of their other locations as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=885.382s">So</a>  that's kind of the high altitude recap. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=889.063s">I</a>  don't mean to run through the product in its entirety again, and Sean will touch on some of the traffic related components. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=895.705s">Any</a>  questions before we transition over to Sean on some of the site related features that I just quickly summarized? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=909.627s">Hearing</a>  none, should I flip it over to Mr. Kelly?</p>

    <p>[Kelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=914.831s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=917.452s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=917.513s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=919.634s">Again,</a>  for the record, Sean Kelly with Van Asken Associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=922.176s">On</a>  behalf of the team, thank you again for having us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=925.058s">A</a>  lot of this might be duplicating Austin's presentation, but I think what I'd like to do is just walk through some of the improvements that we're proposing as they relate to traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=934.384s">We</a>  have had meetings with Tim McGivern and Todd Blake in the engineering department. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=938.426s">And</a>  while this is an auto-oriented development given the gas station nature, the feedback we received from the city was that really the thrust of the improvements relative to traffic they were looking for was pedestrian and bicycle accommodations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=951.471s">Today</a>  the site, quite frankly, doesn't have a lot of ADA compliance, doesn't have direct pedestrian connections to the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=958.553s">So</a>  we've made a number of commitments to upgrade the existing infrastructure that exists today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=963.935s">On</a>  the Fellsway side, that corridor was recently upgraded with new bicycle lanes, but our driveway doesn't meet ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=971.657s">The</a>  wheelchair ramps don't meet current standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=974.237s">The</a>  Delta Island doesn't provide the appropriate pedestrian path through, and we've committed to working with MDC to upgrade that to meet current design criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=984.22s">Similarly,</a>  on the Middlesex Avenue side, again, it's a wide driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=989.225s">We've</a>  looked at the geometry. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=990.507s">We've</a>  looked at what we need to accommodate truck movements. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=993.289s">And</a>  we've proposed to narrow that to the extent feasible to shorten that pedestrian crossing while still ensuring that truck movements can occur safely in and out of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1003.88s">In</a>  conjunction with that, similar to what we're proposing at Fellsway, we would put a painted crosswalk across the driveway, bring the ramps up to ADA compliance, reconstruct the sidewalk along our frontage, which, you know, will be in better shape post-development. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1018.586s">And</a>  then really, I think, probably the most significant pedestrian improvement in terms of, you know, for Middlesex Avenue, as Austin noted on, is really providing a dedicated sidewalk that runs <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1027.451s">from</a>  the corridor directly to the store in the northern edge of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1030.896s">Today,</a>  pedestrians that want to walk the store, you know, walk down the driveway and they share that space with vehicles, which isn't ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1037.747s">This</a>  certainly represents an improvement in terms of pedestrian accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1042.116s">With</a>  regard to bicycle accommodations, again, we did speak with Todd Blake, city traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1049.58s">We</a>  understand that the desire to implement a complete streets design along Middlesex Avenue and the areas that are controlled in the vicinity of our site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1059.624s">This</a>  is mass DOT jurisdiction, so we will ultimately need to get them to sign off, but we have run this by them and they seem in agreement with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1067.708s">As</a>  you can see in the plan that's up here now, the elements of the plan would be to have an actual dedicated bicycle lane that would run from the city line, which is up in the vicinity of Wendy's, runs south all the way down to First Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1083.164s">And</a>  in that area, you again would have a bike lane that's dedicated with a buffered cross-hatched area to delineate the separation from vehicular and <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1090.982s">and</a>  bicycle flows. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1092.783s">And</a>  then from 1st Street down to 5th, it would be a shared configuration with share roads installed along the corridor, as well as signage to share the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1101.267s">So</a>  again, we've presented this to your engineering department for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1105.649s">And</a>  if we agree to amass DOTs on board, we're committed to putting these measures in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1111.812s">We</a>  feel these are what the city had indicated they were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1114.893s">And</a>  while, again, while this is a project that will generate automobile traffic, we think these measures will certainly enhance the pedestrian and bicycle realm and will ultimately be an improvement to not only pedestrians and bicyclists destined to BJs, but also all users along the corridors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1131.956s">That's,</a>  I think, all I have for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1133.676s">I'd</a>  be happy to, again, answer any questions that members of the boards might have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1137.597s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1139.357s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1139.657s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1140.908s">Mr.</a>  Kelly, at this point, I'd like to ask the city's traffic engineer, Todd Blake, to give his comments about the proposal and whether there's any outstanding issues from his perspective.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1158.914s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1161.395s">I</a>  think, as was mentioned, a lot of things have changed since the original proposal, and it's changed for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1170.145s">are</a>  for the following for additional consideration for the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1174.428s">I</a>  don't really have any new written comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1176.009s">I'm</a>  going back to my old written comments to see if point by point if they're addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1181.992s">It</a>  does appear like most of them have been, but there may be a couple of areas for your consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1189.297s">So</a>  circulation wise, they have improved things a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1193.419s">They</a>  have added the cross, the sidewalk from Middlesex Ave to the BJ's entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1198.922s">One</a>  thing I'll say about that, it is a very good feature to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1203.083s">We</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1204.223s">I</a>  would just suggest adding some guide signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1208.664s">For</a>  Medford residents coming from the south on Middlesex Ave, their tendency might be to hang a left in the main drive, thinking that the walkway is there to the center building. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1220.046s">So</a>  they have to cross the drive, hit the corner probably and take a left to use that sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1225.167s">So</a>  it might be good to add a sign at the site drive and also <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1228.902s">where</a>  they make the turn onto the sidewalk, because it may not be as apparent that that sidewalk exists up there on the north side of the site, or on the Malden side. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1240.566s">The</a>  bike lanes, we did ask for a bicycle infrastructure on the Middlesex Avenue corridor, and they did do that, and it looks great. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1248.909s">I</a>  think in my comments, we had said to consider from 5th to 9th as well with Sheroes, so that's up to the board's discretion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1257.16s">Right</a>  now, the share is in that fifth, which would leave a gap between fifth and ninth that the state would have to kind of come back and do at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1268.208s">As</a>  far as pedestrian connections, it looks like looking at my original memo, we had talked about improving pedestrian access from the Fellsway side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1279.875s">And</a>  I'm not sure that piece was fully addressed necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1285.412s">I</a>  think they're upgrading the ramps at the drive on the Fellsway West side, but I don't necessarily think they're adding a pedestrian connection from Fellsway to the front door. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1294.599s">It's</a>  just something to consider when you deliberate. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1297.181s">Just</a>  gonna check to see if there's a few more. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1307.369s">I</a>  believe that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1308.23s">And</a>  obviously they have narrowed the, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1311.765s">the</a>  drive at Middlesex Ave, but I didn't know if it met the needs fully of what was described several meetings back about potentially narrowing even more, so.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1322.451s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Engineer Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1331.416s">I</a>  would let the proponent like to respond to those issues and whether they might be willing to consider them if they haven't already addressed them.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1346.366s">I</a>  can start. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1346.946s">This</a>  is Mark Vaughn. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1348.446s">I</a>  think with respect to the, I try to take some notes here, the signage for the pedestrian walkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1355.129s">I</a>  think that we're certainly amenable to that and whatever signage the city thinks might be appropriate to help better guide pedestrians to where the sidewalk is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1367.174s">I</a>  think with respect to the other comment about the Shiros, I'll defer to, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1374.54s">Either</a>  Sean, or we also have, that you have not heard from yet, but if you recall from prior meetings, Patrick Netriba, who's with BJ's, I know he's here tonight as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1385.148s">But</a>  Sean, do you want to comment on?</p>

    <p>[Kelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1391.442s">I</a>  mean, I think we could certainly look at the share rows from 5th to 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1395.703s">The</a>  comment letter did recommend considering it, but obviously 1st to 5th was the area where it was designated it was wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1403.965s">I</a>  think it's something we can take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1408.766s">And</a>  then with respect to the pedestrian access from Fellsway, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1413.96s">The</a>  backdoor of the from Felsbury is really the loading area, there isn't a very convenient way to bring pedestrian traffic into that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1423.976s">drive</a>  aisle that runs between the building and Woodroof Avenue, but that, you know, accommodates two-way traffic flow today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1429.678s">You</a>  know, there's a number of stop signs along there and we did understand there's some concerns about vehicle speeds and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1436.741s">I'm</a>  not sure it's technically feasible to get a pedestrian walkway in there in a safe manner that can also accommodate two-way traffic flow, you know, in both directions to the side of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1445.425s">So,</a>  you know, we haven't proposed a dedicated route there because I'm not sure we actually could fit it in a safe manner.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1456.532s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1456.913s">Does</a>  Mr. Netriba want to say a few words at this time?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1466.978s">No,</a>  thank you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1468.018s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1469.559s">None</a>  other than to say thank you to the board and to you for your help in making this better. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1475.961s">It's</a>  been a process, and we appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1478.502s">And</a>  we're a member of your community, and we want to continue to be so, and we want to be better every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1484.524s">That's</a>  our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1485.345s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1487.045s">That's</a>  all I have.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1489.226s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1489.666s">I</a>  know we appreciate the willingness <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1494.303s">to</a>  listen to our feedback and to try to accommodate what's been suggested. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1498.633s">I</a>  think that there's been a lot of improvements here to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1502.573s">So</a>  for the reopened public hearing, let me first take any questions from the board and then I'll reopen the floor for public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1514.56s">And</a>  then we will move on to, I'll close that and we'll move on to deliberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1519.023s">So</a>  let me open to board members. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1521.305s">Do</a>  you have any questions or comments at this time?</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1526.967s">Andre,</a>  this is Jackie Patato. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1528.248s">I</a>  have one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1531.03s">It</a>  was iterated that there's a portion of the street that is owned by state and that the proponent would be coordinating with MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1539.577s">I'm</a>  just wondering, out of curiosity, because I have not looked further into this, if there will be any kind of access permit that is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1546.603s">The</a>  reason why I ask, I'm just wondering if that would change the design of what MassDOT is considering versus what the proponent is considering. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1554.029s">That's</a>  my only question.</p>

    <p>[Kelly]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1557.155s">but</a>  the project will require an access permit from MassDOT because of the, we're doing some geometric changes to the driveway to narrow it up, including the ramps and the crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1565.94s">So</a>  we will need a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1567.44s">I</a>  suspect as part of that permit filing, we'll probably try to get the bicycle accommodations done as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1573.323s">And</a>  again, this is a conceptual plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1575.385s">We're</a>  certainly gonna get feedback from DOT in terms of the engineering design. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1578.526s">I</a>  expect there will be some changes, but I think the general thrust is that we will have that exclusive bicycle lane <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1584.249s">along</a>  our frontage, and again, leading up to the city line in Malden.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1588.11s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1589.05s">I</a>  was just thinking holistically and as a whole, I know that we're interested in getting 5th to the 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1595.592s">I'm</a>  not speaking on behalf of the state, but I'm just wondering if this was kind of an area or an opportunity to have that full conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1605.795s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1607.015s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1609.276s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1611.256s">Just</a>  for the board members, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1614.297s">background</a>  or point of information for the locus street project was completely separate project just as an example that had conditions that were subject to the state at the locus street and mystic Valley Parkway traffic signal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1627.867s">And</a>  the state did end up agreeing in that case, and there were some design changes back and forth but very minor and the intent was kept so if, if the applicant says they already reached out to master master to minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1642.841s">I</a>  would imagine it would be a similar case where that maybe some tweaks here and there, but as long as the intent is satisfied, hopefully they'll go along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1652.888s">I</a>  haven't had a conversation with MassDOT yet about it, but they do have state directives that indicate improving bicycle infrastructure, so I don't see why they wouldn't.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1666.947s">Thank</a>  you for mentioning that, for point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1670.548s">And</a>  again, full disclosure, I do work for the state, but I cannot speak on behalf of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1677.27s">And</a>  so that's where I was going when I was asking the proponent about that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1682.192s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1682.572s">And</a>  just for the record, Jackie works for a different agency, not for MassDOT.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1689.574s">Not</a>  for MassDOT.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1694.432s">So</a>  here we would do the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1696.594s">I</a>  think we would include conditions that had the sharrows and obviously we'd have to be subject to approval by MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1713.525s">Other</a>  board members, comments or questions?</p>

    <p>[Claes Andreasen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1726.434s">Gray,</a>  I have questions.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1728.915s">Yes,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Claes Andreasen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1729.755s">Okay,</a>  so I was thinking about the request by the engineering department to create some sort of pedestrian connections on the west side of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1754.375s">And,</a>  you know, it seems that the response from the proponent was very reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1764.099s">I've</a>  driven through there, and I know that, you know, it's a very sort of working, loading type parking lot in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1775.283s">I</a>  got on Google Street View when I was looking at the area, and again, I think what he was saying made a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1783.377s">I</a>  did make the unfortunate turn onto Woodruff Ave and have a look at the condition, assuming that the Google Street View is the current condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1798.125s">And</a>  I was looking at the condition of the edge between the store and Woodruff Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1807.189s">And</a>  there's just two things that just jumped right out at me, and I think either <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1813.248s">two</a>  or three meetings ago, we heard from a number of people in the neighborhood, including one of the city councilors who lives in the neighborhood on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1823.531s">And</a>  I can't really remember where things were left. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1828.173s">But</a>  anyway, my comment is that when I look on Google Street View, I see this chain link fence with a pretty beat down <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1844.757s">series</a>  of green slats and what seems to me zero pedestrian connections between Woodruff Ave and the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1859.886s">And</a>  what's interesting about that is that while I agree that connections to the Fellsway may not be feasible, it seems to me a good <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1874.462s">Um,</a>  a good sort of middle ground might be to sort of dress up the edge of Woodruff Ave, which we really haven't talked about too much and actually create some pedestrian connections there where people could get out, um, you know, through the adjacent streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1891.692s">Um,</a>  this is again, just something that jumped into my head as, as I started looking around, um, on Google, but, um, cause I, cause I do think, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1903.668s">those</a>  pedestrian connections are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1909.171s">And</a>  we've certainly heard from the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1913.113s">And</a>  then just aesthetically, that edge is just a series of either dead or dying trees and old mulch and a really beat up fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1926.2s">So</a>  I think they're, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1929.879s">the</a>  issue of connectivity through the site could be addressed along that edge rather than on the Fellsway edge.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1938.767s">Thank</a>  you, Klaus. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1940.168s">Attorney</a>  Vaughn, would you or one of your team members speak to that?</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1946.575s">Yeah,</a>  why don't I start? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1947.535s">I</a>  think that I understand Klaus's point there with respect to the edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1954.538s">And</a>  one thing I do want to mention that Austin touched upon in the presentation is that we did, although it's not really, I'm going to say, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1964.898s">relevant</a>  or there's a nexus with the gasoline station itself, but because, you know, the gas station is up at that corner, you know, right along Middle 6 Ave, but you'll see on this rendering that we have provided for additional vegetation along the perimeter of our property along Woodruff Avenue to restore vegetation there and make for a <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1988.167s">a</a>  nicer buffer between our site and Woodruff Avenue and the residential neighborhood that's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=1996.59s">With</a>  respect to, if I understood the comment about providing a residential connection through there, I'm not sure we're against that or adverse to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2007.635s">I</a>  don't know what the neighborhood feeling would be about it in terms of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2013.751s">providing</a>  for additional folks walking back and forth into the neighborhood from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2020.078s">But</a>  certainly something that we could look at in the future if that's something that folks felt made sense, but I don't know what the overall feeling with that would be from the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2038.915s">And</a>  Attorney Vaughn, is there any plans to, we've discussed the enhanced landscaping and vegetative screening for that piece between Woodruff and the front of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2049.342s">Is</a>  there any plans to just improve the condition of the chain link fence along that edge or to replace that screening which might be deteriorated?</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2066.774s">Mark,</a>  I can speak to that one if you don't mind.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2068.76s">Yeah,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2069.741s">Sure,</a>  certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2070.542s">So,</a>  um, we actually are going to be upgrading or replacing the slats in the fence, in particular, on both sides of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2079.932s">A</a>  similar fence does exist on the opposite side, but we are, as part of this project, replacing those slats and kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2088.3s">bringing</a>  them into a state of repair, if you will, and putting new slats in. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2092.643s">So</a>  that's been contemplated and is actually being currently orchestrated with the folks from the BJS operation team. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2098.747s">So</a>  that fence is, you know, if there are slats that are broken or not serving their intended purpose, they're going to be replaced.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2104.931s">And</a>  Mr. Turner, was there ever any conversation with the neighborhood residents about the question of access from Woodruff Avenue, either pro or against?</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2119.018s">I</a>  haven't spoken to them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2120.799s">I</a>  don't recall there being much discussion as part of these proceedings, you know, from our initial discussion with the board to this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2129.908s">As</a>  Mr. Vaughn mentioned, if there was a desire from the folks who live on Woodruff Avenue or the streets surrounding there for some kind of connection, we could talk to Patrick and the folks over at BJ's about <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2141.438s">accommodating</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2142.199s">Like</a>  we said, we're not adverse to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2144.341s">We</a>  don't want to do something somebody doesn't want, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2146.884s">And</a>  if they do, we'll talk to them about what makes sense and how to accomplish that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2150.647s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2155.612s">Chairman,</a>  if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2157.214s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2159.108s">Um,</a>  I did mention that the original engineering comment letter, we had a big asterisk next to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2164.831s">So</a>  we said, increase pedestrian access from Millsex, Fellsway, and then the third was from the neighborhood, but only if the neighborhood wanted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2172.935s">It's</a>  usually very neighborhood dependent, case by case. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2177.357s">But</a>  the pedestrian access from Fellsway, yeah, I do get how it's currently more of a delivery entrance, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2187.263s">If</a>  anyone that's a resident in Medford that lives in East Medford Glenwood area that might be using the second street or Myrtle Street crosswalks across the fells, that's the way they would come in, regardless of where the front door is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2201.007s">So,</a>  you know, that's why we had it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2203.968s">I</a>  didn't explore a lot of design options myself, but there is a one-way drive aisle on the north of the building, and there's a two-way on the south. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2213.271s">There</a>  may, again, I didn't look into designing this, but there may be an opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2217.412s">have</a>  one way west on the north side as it is, and one way east on the south side, which would gain a lane for walkway and potentially more landscaping on the south side of the building?</p>

    <p>[Claes Andreasen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2232.622s">I</a>  think I sort of see where you're going with that, Tim, and I sort of contemplated the same thing, but when I made my comment, it just seemed to me that the connection threw into a neighborhood <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2245.928s">might</a>  be a lot more viable and meaningful than just getting out to the Fellsway, which there's not a lot going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2256.595s">It's</a>  sort of a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2261.718s">And</a>  I guess my only follow-up question to Austin would be, you said you're going to replace the slats. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2269.844s">In</a>  my opinion, that's a system that <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2276.778s">doesn't</a>  present well after six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2280.94s">I'm</a>  wondering if there's something that we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2286.363s">I</a>  appreciate that you're enhancing the landscaping, but you're really only doing it up against the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2292.886s">I</a>  mean, it's about 40% of the whole length of Woodruff Street, or less even, if you go past Bradbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2307.062s">You're</a>  going to have this nice landscaping for the first however many, a couple hundred feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2312.786s">And</a>  then the rest, it's going to be back to looking at a street and the side of a building, I suppose. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2322.693s">I</a>  just sort of wonder why that landscaping just doesn't keep going. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2325.595s">And</a>  I think I know the answer is that the street sort of comes up right up against the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2335.535s">I'm</a>  seeing a vegetated landscape between the fence and Woodruff Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2344.797s">Is</a>  that on your property, or is that city property? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2349.638s">Because</a>  there seems to be plenty of room to landscape the whole length of Woodruff rather than just this one little piece.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2361.16s">Through</a>  the chair, if you don't mind, is it OK if I answer directly? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2363.781s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2365.699s">So</a>  to answer that question, that part of the site, if you will, as you've mentioned, it's very narrow there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2376.3s">We</a>  do have room. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2378.425s">even</a>  if it's a little bit limited to do the landscaping where we're currently proposing to do it, that the ability to do that gets substantially reduced as you get further along the building side, just given the narrow limits of the driveway against Woodruff Avenue and how those things kind of are separated just by the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2399.983s">So</a>  there's limited opportunity, if any, to do some landscaping there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2402.645s">And</a>  I believe that landscaping bed is on the city's right-of-way, even if that fence splits it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2407.708s">I</a>  think the landscaping bed is actually on the city's right-of-way there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2413.395s">So</a>  I don't know that we can upgrade defense necessarily. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2416.636s">If</a>  there are parts of defense that just clearly need to be upgraded because it hasn't done well over the years, we can entertain that with the folks at BJS. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2423.698s">I</a>  don't know that we're going to be able to replace it in its entirety and especially given some of the commitments that we've made here to do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2434.1s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2435.643s">I</a>  think there's limited opportunity to do some additional landscaping there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2438.185s">If</a>  we can accommodate it, we will, but I don't want to promise you that we can actually do that given the spatial limitations that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2443.209s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2444.79s">At</a>  this point, I would be inclined to leave it up to the city whether to convene a follow-up meeting with neighborhood residents in that area with BJs for any further possible improvements or issues that need to be addressed.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2463.217s">Okay,</a>  and then I know that there was some brief discussion about the sidewalk connectivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2467.36s">And</a>  I can understand on the surface, how it might look like, yeah, we have a lane to reduce, but really what that upper driveway, this upper driveway here, that's really intended to get delivery trucks out of the circulation patterns of the primary part of the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2481.61s">And</a>  that that driveway is really utilitarian. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2483.671s">It's</a>  not intended for customer vehicle traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2486.916s">One,</a>  because we don't want customer vehicle traffic interacting with kind of the nerve center of the property and the loading. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2492.999s">Eliminating</a>  this and making it one-way drive means anybody who wants to go out to the Fells is going to go along and introduce there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2498.882s">So</a>  that's not something we want to introduce or consider at this point.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2509.847s">Other</a>  comments by board members or questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2516.957s">Hearing</a>  none, I'd like to reopen the public comment portion of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2521.898s">And</a>  Annie and Alicia, if you could help me call on members of the public, that'd be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2533.642s">I</a>  see Jessica Wall.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2539.664s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2539.864s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2540.824s">And</a>  good evening, members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2543.365s">My</a>  name is Jessica Wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2544.585s">I'm</a>  an attorney at Anderson and Krieger in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2547.288s">I</a>  represent SF Medford Investments and also a group of Wellington residents opposed to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2553.292s">I</a>  want to thank you for the opportunity to comment this evening and for your continued consideration of our comments on the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2560.917s">My</a>  clients continue to be concerned about some of the traffic issues posed or traffic numbers posed by BJs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2568.942s">As</a>  you know, there's been some back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2572.146s">dialogue</a>  about that in previous hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2574.787s">We</a>  continue to have concerns about the data that BJ's is relying on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2579.129s">They've</a>  gone out to one particular site to collect some data, which we think is under-representative and not counting enough sites within professional traffic analysis standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2592.075s">So</a>  if the board would be receptive, our traffic consultant, Stephen Elman from Benesch, would be happy to explain very briefly <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2601.137s">his</a>  concerns with those pieces of traffic information. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2604.838s">So</a>  our request is that there be further study from BJ's about data from other locations about traffic impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2612.14s">But</a>  if Mr. Chair, if you would allow, Steven can offer further information.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2617.901s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2618.542s">Happy</a>  to recognize Mr. Ullman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2621.697s">We</a>  just got to get you unmuted.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2622.878s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2623.358s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2625.179s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2625.799s">My</a>  name is Steve Allman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2626.919s">I'm</a>  a professional traffic engineer with Alfred Burnition Company. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2631.461s">Our</a>  office is in Glastonbury, Connecticut and Boston, Connecticut, the two local offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2638.885s">I'm</a>  also a registered professional engineer in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2642.006s">As</a>  Jessica noted that when they redid their analysis and adjusted their trip generation, they used a single site for their analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2652.849s">The</a>  ITE trip generation manual discusses what you should do if you do not match existing land use codes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2663.012s">Now,</a>  there is no land use code for a wholesale club with gas station, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2668.253s">or</a>  a wholesale club gas station all by itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2672.598s">The</a>  reason I have concerns with this is that BJ sells gasoline off market rate at discounted prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2680.767s">On</a>  August 20th, the oil express gasoline <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2683.83s">publication</a>  noted that BJ's gasoline sales increased by 4% in the previous quarter, where most gasoline stations lost 10, 15, 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2694.68s">The</a>  average price for the week of August 17 for the Commonwealth was $2.13 a gallon. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2700.765s">And</a>  it's my understanding someone went to the Norwood site on Saturday the 15th and saw that BJ's was selling approximately $0.30 cheaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2710.454s">According</a>  to the ITE generation manual, if there is no good fit for land use, data should be collected at a minimum of three sites, preferably five. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2722.683s">BJ's</a>  has collected data from one site, and we don't see any reason why they couldn't do at least two more sites count in the area, not four. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2733.591s">Stoneham</a>  is not really the same context as the Medford BJ's. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2738.915s">Stoneham</a>  site is located on an isolated roadway far from the main thoroughfare at the end of a dead-end street, while Medford site, as you know, has driveways to two arterial roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2750.782s">Um,</a>  if they didn't want to do counts at actual BJ's, I got to imagine that since BJ's is a member club and they sell their own gas, they should be able to provide the board with, um, sales data for, for several gas stations to get a good feel for the trip generation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2770.169s">Um,</a>  that's really my concern is that they only studied one site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2775.311s">It's</a>  not really representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2777.052s">They</a>  said that it justified their data, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2780.797s">I</a>  have a hard time with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2781.998s">So</a>  just for the board's consideration, and that's all I have.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2787.841s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Ullman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2789.942s">Are</a>  there other members of the public who wish to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2800.188s">Seeing</a>  none, I will now close the public participation portion of the hearing, and we'll move to deliberation by the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2812.515s">One</a>  question that I have for the proponent is, the comments from the members, the folks who just spoke reminded me, I don't believe that there's going to be signage on Middlesex Avenue that has the gasoline pricing, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2833.172s">I</a>  don't recall seeing that in, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2840.123s">in</a>  the design. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2840.983s">I</a>  know there's like a big BJ sign, but I don't think there's going to be like large gasoline pricing signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2847.305s">Am</a>  I right about that or incorrect?</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2850.286s">We</a>  actually haven't finalized a final sign package, Mr. Chairman, in terms of the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2857.687s">But</a>  my understanding is that whatever signage would be put on the pylon would be within the <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2864.569s">square</a>  footage of that pylon as it exists today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2867.65s">I</a>  think they may seek to incorporate a reference to the gas, but we're not quite there yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2873.932s">And</a>  I understand that that's a separate permitting process that we would need to go through as part of, you know, any signage that would be out there.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2882.855s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2885.936s">I</a>  think my <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2887.143s">My</a>  recommendation would be to not have the pricing signage out on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2892.485s">I</a>  know that looking at places like Stop and Shop that have an internal gas station, you don't see the pricing signage out on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2901.889s">So</a>  keeping it internal to the site I think makes sense, especially in terms of not having traffic folks going in who aren't members and then can't be serviced and then cycling back unnecessarily out into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2916.415s">into</a>  Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2925.166s">Board</a>  members, what is your sense in terms of deliberation? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2929.772s">Any</a>  further questions or comments you want to make?</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2933.838s">I</a>  wanted to go back to the traffic, especially since this is one of the main concerns that I had originally about three months ago when we first started with the first hearing for BJ's gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2945.883s">And</a>  we all established that Middlesex is a very auto-centric area, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2950.625s">And</a>  that the gas station will most definitely increase and add to the existing conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2957.207s">I</a>  actually myself had concluded that there was going to be more impact than what had been presented or demonstrated to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2964.892s">However,</a>  in talking through that, one of the things that I noticed at the second hearing, and I thought we were all in agreement with this, although I do not want to negate the public's concern in which Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2979.741s">Wall</a>  is representing, is that the proponent had done so well <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=2985.044s">in</a>  in mitigating a lot of the nuances that um not that it would balance it out but I we didn't discuss the traffic a little bit more only because there were so many other nuances that were going to be mitigated so I I don't know how much we need to go back into traffic at this point and now I'm a little concerned only because <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3005.318s">of</a>  all the other work that has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3006.879s">But</a>  again, I do not want to negate the public's concern in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3011.041s">But</a>  at the same time, if we did go back and use a further study, I'm not sure what the board at this point could do with that information, what recommendations could be made outside of, Andre, what you have already recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3023.648s">Don't</a>  put the signage out there to attract more. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3028.031s">I'm</a>  thinking aloud right now, but at the same time, letting you know my thoughts.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3034.409s">If</a>  I could speak to that through the chair to board member Furtado. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3039.154s">Yes,</a>  Attorney Vaughn. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3041.036s">We</a>  did actually, I say we, Van Assen associate Sean Kelly did submit to the board back in August a follow-up memorandum. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3050.23s">regarding</a>  the traffic and responded to comments that were brought up by the board as well as the folks at Benesh relative to council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3061.92s">We</a>  feel that everything that's been submitted has been done pursuant to industry requirements standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3066.985s">We</a>  did go out and look at another site and it gave us comfort that our numbers were appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3074.882s">And</a>  we feel very confident that the traffic has been evaluated and assessed appropriately as it relates to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3083.706s">But</a>  I just wanted to make sure that everyone understood we did submit a follow-up memo that I know was circulated to Todd Blake as well, relative to the traffic analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3097.573s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3098.634s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3099.745s">And</a>  Ajay, in speaking to that, I guess would this be the proper time to have Mr. Blake speak to that submission from August, in which perhaps Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3109.853s">Wall</a>  is not aware of?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3112.536s">Well,</a>  if you'd like Engineer Blake to comment on that, we can invite him to do that.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3117.24s">Mr.</a>  Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3121.523s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3121.803s">Thank</a>  you, Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3125.226s">When</a>  I look at these sort of things, I'm trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3128.15s">You</a>  know, explain the situation to the residents and the board from my perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3132.831s">I</a>  think both sides of the conversation have good points, and particularly Mr. Ullman's comments about empirical data versus IT data. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3141.493s">And</a>  if you do empirical, three sites recommend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3144.453s">As</a>  a private consultant, I've done that in the past myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3147.134s">That</a>  is the better way to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3148.994s">But</a>  I usually try to cut to the chase with this sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3154.119s">I</a>  truly don't believe that you would get both sides ever to agree on an exact number. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3159.46s">So</a>  I try to take that into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3162.601s">And</a>  there's varying degrees, obviously, for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3165.522s">If</a>  100 cars are added versus 1,000, that's a difference, or 500. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3169.523s">So</a>  ultimately, both sides present their best estimates of projections and their points of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3177.464s">And</a>  we try to mitigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3180.243s">where</a>  I try to suggest a mitigation package that might mitigate some of those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3184.724s">And</a>  then the board obviously makes the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3186.505s">So</a>  there's definitely some gray area. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3189.366s">I</a>  just, in terms of ever getting an agreement of a particular number, I don't necessarily see that happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3196.388s">So</a>  I'm trying to just give you guys my perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3201.069s">And</a>  I think by, so if someone came up with a higher number, what you would do is maybe add more mitigation to help address that higher number. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3210.839s">So</a>  the approach that we took was recommending mitigation from complete street standpoint that hopefully balances out the mode split to address it that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3221.707s">Another</a>  approach could be to add capacity to allow for those additional cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3227.691s">So</a>  there's no exact science here and it's really up to the board knowing all that information, exactly how much, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3236.334s">you</a>  think is reasonable in which approach you want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3240.238s">I</a>  mean, we're tasked with reviewing things from a complete streets perspective, but I also get the traditional way of adding capacity and improving levels of service and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3252.65s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3254.708s">if</a>  that helps.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3255.729s">Yeah,</a>  thank you, Mr. Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3256.971s">Personally,</a>  I feel comfortable with the mitigation that we've accomplished here. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3260.395s">My</a>  priority has really been around safety, and I think the investments that we're seeing here will improve the safety of that intersection.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3271.432s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I echo that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3273.693s">I'm</a>  all for the complete streets elements that are being done as opposed to addressing safety, as opposed to adding capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3282.158s">Because</a>  as a planner myself, and this is nothing against all the information done by IT, as well as the great work of traffic engineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3290.622s">But</a>  to me, you widen a street to accommodate more traffic, guess what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3295.785s">More</a>  cars come. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3298.947s">really</a>  good with the mitigation that we have already done, or that has been expressed by the proponent.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3306.571s">I</a>  just want to review the the letters that have been submitted by the city's department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3314.535s">So</a>  we have a letter from Timothy McGivern, the city engineer, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3319.484s">in</a>  an updated letter to the board that was dated August 18th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3323.406s">We</a>  have Mr. Blake's updated comments that he mentioned a few things which we may or may not want to take action on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3332.249s">The</a>  fire chief's June 16th letter, the Brian Cairns Commissioner of Public Works letter from June 16th, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3343.013s">and</a>  Paul Moki, the building commissioner, his letter from March 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3347.797s">So</a>  I just want to ask the proponent whether the items that were in those letters from city departments, have they, in your opinion, all been addressed or are you able to address them in the course of the project as possible conditions for moving forward?</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3367.362s">Yes,</a>  if I could, Mr. Chairman, Attorney Mark Vaughn. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3369.264s">We</a>  are familiar with those comment letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3372.968s">I</a>  know that Annie was kind enough to send them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3376.332s">We</a>  got them all individually, of course, before, but we saw them today. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3379.696s">And</a>  I think that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3381.358s">either</a>  modify the plan to address them, or I know that Austin has responded to some of the more technical engineering comments and how the plan can address those. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3391.75s">But</a>  Austin, please jump in if you feel like anything needs to be expanded upon as it relates to that, particularly DPW or engineering.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3400.68s">No,</a>  I think as we've mentioned before, we're comfortable with the comments that the engineering department had provided with respect to some of the onsite improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3409.543s">We've</a>  addressed those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3410.723s">There</a>  are some that were construction related when the project transitions out of the entitlement phase into construction, and we're comfortable accommodating those requests as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3418.506s">They're</a>  not unusual or different from most other projects, so we're quite comfortable there.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3424.143s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3424.744s">So</a>  as we approach a vote, the conditions that would be... <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3431.672s">Um,</a>  part of the vote would be the what's included in the letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3436.074s">I</a>  think there are a few loose ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3437.595s">We</a>  as a board just need to, uh, finalize particularly the things that engineer Blake raised this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3445.62s">I</a>  think the pedestrian signage so that folks don't walk in the automobile entrance is, uh, it should be an easy one that we would want to include. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3457.546s">Uh,</a>  I think we've heard that there's <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3462.142s">some,</a>  there may be some desire on the part of neighborhood residents to improve access from Woodruff Ave, but we are not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3473.627s">So</a>  I would say that we would leave that up to the city to pursue with the neighbors and BJs in the future and would not make that a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3486.053s">And</a>  I think we've also heard just the difficulty of <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3491.671s">creating</a>  a good pedestrian access from the rear of the loading area of the site, which I would also be willing to not include as a condition at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3502.839s">I</a>  don't wanna necessarily encourage people to use that entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3511.286s">Board</a>  members, what are your thoughts about those matters or others?</p>

    <p>[Claes Andreasen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3518.4s">The</a>  more I think about it, I would definitely ask that at minimum, the edge, I forgot the name of the street now.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3529.308s">Woodruff?</a> </p>

    <p>[Claes Andreasen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3530.789s">Woodruff,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3534.591s">Be</a>  addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3539.214s">I</a>  don't know exactly how to put that in the wording here, Andre, but <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3548.546s">You</a>  know, I think one of the big themes that we've seen that has sort of come forward in this review of this project is that I think everybody's asking for BJs to be a better neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3567.08s">And,</a>  you know, it's hard for me to get behind this when there's something so glaring. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3579.748s">I</a>  know we're dealing with real data and things on a lot of this, but the fact is we're adding a gas station, which is something that in a residential neighborhood could easily be seen as detrimental. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3596.279s">And</a>  I think they need to do everything they can to counter that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3603.723s">And</a>  I think they have a great opportunity to do that in that woodruff edge, which I didn't realize was so degraded.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3611.628s">Well,</a>  I think there's a number of questions that have been raised around that discussion that we wouldn't be able to resolve tonight, or maybe not even in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3619.99s">So</a>  plus, I would be more inclined to ask the city to follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3627.651s">And</a>  Engineer Blake, how would you feel about having a follow-up meeting with BJs and neighborhood residents</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3640.231s">I</a>  would also like to add that that's a suggestion that we've heard like from Chris and from Todd, but I don't feel like we've heard from residents that they want an additional connection at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3655.594s">And</a>  I agree that there are both sides to that.</p>

    <p>[Claes Andreasen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3659.075s">I'm</a>  neutral on the connection, but I'm more interested in the edge.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3669.293s">The</a>  greening of the edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3670.374s">And</a>  so I think that there could be some work for us to clarify with BJ's exactly where the property line is. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3678.919s">And</a>  if we find that the property line is such that there is vegetated or <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3687.825s">could</a>  be vegetated area along there that is city owned. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3691.906s">We</a>  can ask DPW to get some attention over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3695.087s">And</a>  if the property, if that's actually all of that from the pavement towards BJ's is their property, then the city shouldn't be doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3706.651s">And</a>  we would have to ask BJ's to keep it.</p>

    <p>[Claes Andreasen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3709.712s">I'm</a>  all for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3711.052s">And</a>  then the last piece is the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3712.653s">And</a>  I'm going to repeat my comment that that fence <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3716.368s">plastic</a>  slats in a fence is ugly, and I think they could do better.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3721.17s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, if I may?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3722.751s">Yes,</a>  Engineer Blake.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3724.772s">Yeah,</a>  three points. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3725.832s">So</a>  the fence looks like a no-brainer because it's likely the fence is constructed exactly on the property line because otherwise the fence would be further out. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3736.738s">And</a>  if it was further into the area that's kind of in the street right-of-way, then there may be an opportunity to do the walkway that we spoke of. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3746.372s">landscaping</a>  either or. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3748.153s">So</a>  the other thing is I don't have the public private street list in front of me, but it's 39% private streets in Medford, so I wouldn't necessarily wanna completely solidify what the city can and can't do there if it's one of the private streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3766.341s">In</a>  terms of connections, that's why I had a big asterisk in my recommendations because some communities don't wanna be connected, so I don't wanna speak for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3774.104s">But</a>  I think in one of the previous meetings, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3776.747s">there</a>  were folks that may have spoke against the connection when Councilor Marks attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3782.369s">Yeah,</a>  when we talked about the break in the fence further down. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3786.191s">And</a>  then one last point in terms of if the connection isn't desirable, and if there's not much you could do internally to the pedestrian connection from the Fellsway side, and these outstanding traffic issues are still in some people's mind, you could consider <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3802.993s">additional</a>  things that improve pedestrian safety or awareness on the Fellsway side. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3809.036s">For</a>  instance, there's two unsignalized crosswalks crossing Fellsway West, second and Myrtle, that could use enhanced signage like flashing signs or pedestrian button, RFB style. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3823.422s">So,</a>  but those would be subject to DCR, just something to consider.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3828.964s">So</a>  Engineer Blake, I didn't totally understand what you were saying about the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3833.968s">What</a>  was your position on that?</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3836.65s">The</a>  fence, it seems like a low hanging fruit because it's on their property and it does, as the other members pointed out, that particular stretch does have, it's lacking screening. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3849.061s">So</a>  it doesn't necessarily seem like you're tied to a chain link fence with slats. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3853.605s">I</a>  mean, you could do one of these really nice <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3857.05s">stained</a>  wooden fences that a lot of residential areas have if you can't fit landscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3862.139s">So</a>  I don't know, there's other options, I think.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3865.22s">Mr.</a>  Chair, if you don't mind, just as something for further consideration of the board, I mean, perhaps a condition of a presumptive approval would be that the applicant continue to work with the team at the community development department, as well as the engineering staff to see if there are additional opportunities to further enhance the screening between the property and Woodroof Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3884.432s">And</a>  to the extent that you empower the team at the community development and engineering departments, it would be amenable to working with them.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3894.293s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3894.674s">That</a>  seems reasonable to me.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3899.519s">I</a>  have actually one other thing that I feel like I should bring up, and that is the new sidewalk that you're adding. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3908.469s">I</a>  believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3912.914s">Mr.</a>  Turner and others may be aware that there's some drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3917.86s">So</a>  the portion that's not actually part of this plan that's connecting all the way to the club, that there is some additional drainage treatment that's going to need to occur down there, where the parking lot currently drains straight into <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3933.757s">the</a>  wetland. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3935.758s">You'll</a>  have to address that with MassDEP because of the whole, it won't go back to the CONCOMM because of the appeal and the superseding order of conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3946.562s">But</a>  you'll need to make sure that that sidewalk change and all that DEP is comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3955.053s">and</a>  how you treat the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3956.854s">Right</a>  now, the water runs straight out of the parking lot into the wetland. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3960.477s">If</a>  you put sidewalks straight across it, you know, with your regular curb, the water's gonna pool up in your parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3966.98s">It's</a>  gonna be a problem operationally for the club. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3969.262s">So</a>  you'll need to look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3971.863s">And</a>  I know we looked at it on site so that this is not like stunning, but just to acknowledge that something will have to be dealt with down there.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3982.073s">That's</a>  that's a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3982.853s">We</a>  shouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3983.214s">Thank</a>  you for bringing that back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3984.394s">So</a>  we are working with PJ says that comes together. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3986.795s">He</a>  would point that out and identified as an operational concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3990.036s">So</a>  we're gonna We're like as part of the sidewalk improvements on how to make sure the drainage is water slowing downhill, so to speak, and isn't, um <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=3998.78s">isn't</a>  causing any issues in that regard.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4001.421s">And</a>  I don't think that the board needs to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4004.161s">I</a>  just sort of wanted to say in a public venue that that'll need to go to MassDEP because of the open, normally it would go back to what the Conservation Commission will look at, but because if there's a superseding order of conditions there or there is one coming, sorry that my brain has just stopped to where that stands. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4025.445s">They'll</a>  be the ones that need to <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4028.12s">to</a>  approve that.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4030.461s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4031.461s">Yes,</a>  Engineer Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4033.842s">So</a>  for the sidewalk, I'm not familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4035.543s">Is</a>  the runoff from the landscaped area or from the parking lot?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4039.605s">Because</a>  it- This isn't by Middlesex. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4043.686s">This</a>  is really in their parking lot, very close to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4049.809s">So</a>  much, it's outside of the gas station area all the way down near the- Delivery driveway? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4058.151s">Yeah,</a>  it's near that.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4059.872s">It's</a>  an operational maintenance item related to the stormwater that we're going to be improving as part of the sidewalk construction.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4065.695s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4066.215s">Yeah,</a>  that's that's what my point was going to be in the in the effort to reconstruct or add that sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4072.518s">There</a>  are opportunities with the type of curb chosen, whether it's Petunias Berm, Granite Curb, and also with catch basins and other drainage elements, you could improve that area, at least within the extent of where the sidewalks being at.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4088.793s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4092.475s">I</a>  think we've heard there are conditions from the letters of the department heads that are amenable to the proponent. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4098.278s">There</a>  is the pedestrian signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4101.96s">There</a>  is the follow-up with the proponent and the Office of Community Development and the city engineer's office about the screening issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4114.106s">And</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4118.283s">That</a>  is it in terms of outstanding conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4122.004s">If</a>  I'm missing anything, any.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4128.905s">Andre,</a>  Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4130.466s">Hi,</a>  David. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4132.986s">I'm</a>  not sure on your conditions what the final word was on closing the gap on the bicycle, the Sheros and so forth from 5th to 9th.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4145.047s">Yes,</a>  thank you for reminding me of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4147.288s">Yeah,</a>  that's a good question. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4150.41s">I</a>  think we've heard that they're open to exploring it, but I think we should include it in a list of conditions subject to the approval of the state on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4171.121s">Attorney</a>  Vaughn, would you have any problem with that?</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4178.495s">I</a>  don't, but I'm not the one writing the checks, I guess, for everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4181.055s">So</a>  I'll speak, but if Patrick wants to jump in and correct me on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4187.237s">But</a>  obviously, I think if you look at everything that we're doing mitigation-wise off-site, there's a significant number here in terms of trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4197.479s">address</a>  the totality of the items that have been raised by board members. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4202.183s">So</a>  I know that would be some additional funding, but Patrick or Sean, I don't know if you're comfortable with that, but please jump in.</p>

    <p>[Austin Turner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4216.716s">I</a>  think Patrick has to be unmuted, Annie, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4221.96s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4226.271s">Thank</a>  you very much, Annie. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4227.192s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4227.912s">Mr.</a>  Chair, we're happy to commit to the sharrows from 5th to 9th. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4231.694s">We</a>  will agree to that as a condition.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4235.456s">I</a>  think we were told it was the gap also from the 1st to 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4239.539s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4240.879s">5th</a>  to 9th.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4242.12s">Oh,</a>  it's 5th to 9th as the gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4243.941s">Sorry,</a>  I was confused on which was the gap there. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4246.022s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4246.303s">Yeah,</a>  there are bike lanes to 1st and then sharrows from 1st to 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4250.005s">So</a>  5th to 9th was the gap.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4252.066s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4252.486s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4253.487s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4253.987s">Well,</a>  and thank you, Mr. Netriba, then. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4256.328s">appreciate</a>  that. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4260.369s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4262.31s">Is</a>  there and then the other thing that I brought up was just in terms of conditions was not to not to have the <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4279.028s">the</a>  gas pricing numbers as part of the signage on Middlesex Avenue, but have it keep that interior to the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4289.435s">Is</a>  that something that you'd be willing to consider?</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4292.897s">I</a>  would respectfully ask if the board would consider not making that a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4298.381s">I</a>  think we heard your desire, but I don't think that we want to <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4306.703s">hamstring</a>  the operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4308.364s">I</a>  just don't know enough as to what they would, you know, typically want to see or, you know, signs evolve over time to, you know, you may have signage there initially that, you know, they may want to change, but <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4321.668s">Patrick,</a>  I don't think that we're looking to increase the size of the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4325.75s">That</a>  pylon that's out there would be within the same square footage. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4328.951s">But</a>  I guess that's what my preference would be, Mr. Chairman, if it would not be a condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4335.873s">But</a>  obviously, we have to go through a separate approval process for any signage.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4341.33s">Yeah,</a>  I echo what Mark said, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4344.511s">We'd</a>  like to handle that outside of this, via the proper mechanisms that the city has set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4350.354s">But</a>  as an aside, we just seek parity in terms of our competition and the folks that we do business against. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4357.276s">For</a>  example, our neighbor across the street has an LED sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4361.398s">And</a>  for us not to have that as well, could you approve our application? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4365.38s">Not</a>  to be presumptive, of course, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4366.92s">It</a>  would seem fair that we would have that ability to do so as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4370.942s">And</a>  we have to advertise our pricing to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4374.484s">So</a>  that's a state law, and I couldn't quote you chapter and verse on that, but we certainly wanna preserve that ability in the future, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4382.33s">So</a>  I'll leave it at that.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4383.831s">Right,</a>  well, I'm just offering it as some feedback, understanding that that's a separate issue that's outside our scope is approval of the signage will be with the city council.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4396.679s">And</a>  we understand that.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4400.082s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4401.304s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor from the board? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4404.027s">I</a>  can help you make the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4416.442s">It's</a>  got to come from the board members.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4422.381s">Can</a>  you reiterate the conditions and or the recommendations in which the board is deliberating on? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4429.77s">Andre?</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4430.631s">Yeah,</a>  so the conditions, should you want to move to approve the project with conditions, the conditions would include <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4443.949s">all</a>  the items that are in the letters from the city department heads, and there's a whole kind of list of those letters, which the proponent has agreed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4453.252s">And</a>  then there would be the pedestrian signage and the follow up with the office of community development about the, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4468.542s">further</a>  improvements to screening and access along Woodruff Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4477.768s">And</a>  the sharrows, of course, to fill in the gap with the bike lanes.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4484.412s">So</a>  the proponent has agreed to the sharrows, but I was a little confused on the wayfinding. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4490.036s">Are</a>  we making that a condition for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4493.878s">Is</a>  that the wayfinding should be?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4498.196s">Yes,</a>  I think we're just talking about a small signage that would tell people where the sidewalk is to access the site.</p>

    <p>[8oEn2KkMIiU_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4520.309s">Andre,</a>  are you looking for a motion on the project with those conditions? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4524.912s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4529.031s">I'll</a>  make a motion that we move ahead with the project with the conditions listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4536.174s">The</a>  conditions being all the conditions from the department heads as listed in their letters, the pedestrian signage, and the follow-up with the Office of Community Development regarding Woodroof Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4547.732s">Okay,</a>  and just let me get Annie and Alicia here to make sure I'm doing this correctly, since we are the Special Permit Granting Authority, as well as the Site Plan Review, maybe we have to take two separate votes, is that correct?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4559.784s">It's</a>  one vote Special Permit for Site Plan Review.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4563.108s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4564.669s">If</a>  you can just add that to the motion, approve the Special Permit for Site Plan Review.</p>

    <p>[afyYb4sUUnA_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4569.418s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, just a point of information before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4573.06s">So</a>  I just want to be on the off-site items that we're talking about on Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4577.703s">I</a>  think you had indicated this before, but obviously that would all be subject to final mass DOT approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4583.327s">So</a>  I mean, we're comfortable constructing and paying for it, but it's subject to DOT approval for those items. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4592.552s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4593.293s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4595.154s">So</a>  Mr. Chair, I'm sorry to interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4598.883s">important</a>  note. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4602.024s">So</a>  it's in regard it's in regard to saying conditions from the department has letters. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4607.047s">So</a>  in the letter from engineering there's several civil engineering items as well as the traffic and in that traffic original letter it talks about the walkway from Middlesex to the building and also the Fellsway West to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4620.433s">So</a>  just to avoid some confusion in the confusion in the future about <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4625.168s">what</a>  the actual conditions are, because we've had issues with that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4630.671s">It's</a>  actually, so in this case, it would be the letter, but excluding some of them because they did not necessarily add that walkway from Fells Way West. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4641.397s">That's</a>  one example. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4643.278s">So</a>  if you just include the letter as a whole, it will be contradictory to that.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4649.982s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4652.177s">So</a>  let's try it.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4654.698s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4654.998s">We</a>  could say the department had letters and the engineering letter as discussed during this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4665.283s">And</a>  Ali has been taking notes, and Ali and Annie can review the video and making sure that the ones that they verbally agreed to are the ones that are in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4674.407s">It's</a>  also very easy for a project this complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4677.089s">I</a>  think we're happy to send, we always send the letter, the approval with the conditions to Andre for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4684.514s">We</a>  could send them to the applicant as well and make sure that they heard the same thing we heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4691.178s">And</a>  if there's any disagreement, we have a video so we can review the video.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4697.342s">That</a>  would be very helpful, Lisa. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4698.783s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4700.965s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4703.808s">So</a>  the motion on the floor would be whether or not to approve the special permit with site plan review for the application for the gas station at the BJ site with conditions, including the letters from city department heads, and we will enumerate those with <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4727.392s">excluding</a>  the pedestrian access from the Fellsway West, and including additionally pedestrian signage to the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4750.246s">The</a>  bike lanes from 5th to 9th <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4757.778s">and</a>  the, I feel like I'm missing one here, and the follow-up meeting with the Office of Community Development and the proponent and the city engineer regarding any further improvements along the Woodruff line. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4787.306s">Does</a>  that sound like we've captured everything? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4795.19s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4795.67s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4796.35s">Katie,</a>  would you like to so move?</p>

    <p>[8oEn2KkMIiU_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4800.612s">Should</a>  I repeat that?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4802.133s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4802.873s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[8oEn2KkMIiU_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4803.714s">I</a>  so move.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4805.615s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4805.955s">Is</a>  there a second?</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4806.815s">I</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4808.716s">Thank</a>  you, Jackie. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4809.597s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4810.377s">We'll</a>  just go to a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4813.298s">Katie</a>  McHugh.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4814.559s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4835.87s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4836.871s">And</a>  I am an aye as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4841.292s">So</a>  I believe that is one, two, three, four. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4845.923s">Five</a>  in favor, one abstention, one recused. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4852.228s">I</a>  believe the motion passes.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4859.453s">All</a>  right, thank you, Mr. Netriba and your team. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4861.874s">Appreciate</a>  all of the discussion and work and mitigation that went into this.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4883.318s">The</a>  next item on the agenda is a public hearing for a brewery ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4889.446s">The</a>  community development board will be making a recommendation to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4895.334s">Let</a>  me read the public hearing notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4911.267s">Public</a>  hearing notice amendment to chapter 94, zoning revised ordinances of the city of Medford, Massachusetts Community Development Board, September 16th, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4920.812s">Medford</a>  Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Wednesday, September 16th, 2020 after 6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4926.255s">via</a>  Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a petition referred by the Medford City Council in council paper 20-481. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4935.4s">Chapter</a>  94 zoning section 94-2 definitions is proposed to be amended to add definitions for quote brewery quote tasting room slash tap room quote barrel and quote brew pub. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4949.466s">Section</a>  94-148 table of use regulations is proposed to be amended by adding use 35b <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4957.383s">brewery,</a>  which would be allowable by right in C2, I, O, and MUZ districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4965.59s">In</a>  the C1 district, breweries operating with seven barrels or under would be allowable by right, and breweries operating with more than seven barrels would be allowable by Special Permit Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4978.121s">The</a>  full text of the amendment may be viewed in the office of the city clerk City Hall room 103 or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org slash departments slash community hyphen development by clicking on current CD board filings.</p>

    <p>[Jacqueline McPherson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=4997.75s">Andre,</a>  it just came to my attention, I just wanted to make a full disclosure on something, just to make sure that it's not a problem later. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5005.935s">My</a>  eldest daughter just mentioned, she says, hey mom, I hear that you're going to be listening to a case from my 11th grade teacher, Max Hennig, and he was her 11th grade teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5020.023s">Circa</a>  2010, I have no special interest or financial gain in this project, but I did want to disclose that apparently this is a discussion that amongst their class right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5031.731s">So,</a>  but I wanted to put that on record.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5034.993s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5038.936s">Yes,</a>  go ahead Andre.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5041.277s">I</a>  want you to finish with Jackie first. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5042.638s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5043.599s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5044.563s">I</a>  don't believe that rises to the level of a conflict, so I think you're good. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5050.843s">Go</a>  ahead, Mr. Bloomberg.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5053.466s">So</a>  I wanted to share with the group that when I saw the materials on Friday and then reviewed them on Sunday, it came to my attention that this draft ordinance is somehow connected with a company in which my family has financial interest, although de minimis, and one that was obtained well in advance of my participation with the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5075.838s">I</a>  feel like for that reason that I should recuse myself from the discussions tonight into liberation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5081.943s">So</a>  if that's acceptable to you, Andre and to the board, I'll go ahead and mute myself and drop off the screen for this item.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5093.151s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5093.551s">Thank</a>  you, member Bloomberg. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5096.773s">Appreciate</a>  that.</p>

    <p>[David Blumberg]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5098.755s">Sorry</a>  about that.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5099.836s">It's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5100.776s">And</a>  I appreciate everybody's <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5106.17s">have</a>  good habits on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5109.014s">And</a>  let me just finish on the public hearing notice that folks who want to participate can, let me just say this one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5126.682s">So</a>  to participate during the hearing, questions and comments may be emailed to OCD at Medford-MA.gov or submitted via phone to 781-393-2480. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5140.434s">That's</a>  781-393-2480. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5142.395s">All</a>  votes will be roll call votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5146.359s">And</a>  please, if you speak, please introduce yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5150.402s">And</a>  members of the public will need your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5156.142s">Andre,</a>  I feel like we should just also mention, it makes it sound like if people are connected to this, that they have to send an email or call a phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5163.466s">If</a>  you are in the Zoom call, you may use the raise hand function in the members list, and we can call on you during the public hearing portion of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5175.633s">You</a>  don't have to call the phone number if you're on the Zoom call.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5178.915s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5179.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5179.715s">Very</a>  good clarification, Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5187.733s">All</a>  right, so let me invite Paul Moki, the city of Medford's building commissioner, to speak to the draft ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5201.499s">Is</a>  that, or do we have, Annie, is that who we should have go first, or is there a proponent that should go before that? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5208.742s">All</a>  right, Paul, thank you, Mr. Moki.</p>

    <p>[Paul Mochi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5212.804s">Okay,</a>  good evening, everybody, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5217.068s">So</a>  on this, looking at this proposed draft, I noticed in the, would you like me to just comment on it, Andre, or do you want to go over some of the- Well, if you don't mind explaining it so that members of the public who might not be familiar with it can understand what it is exactly, what it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5236.798s">Okay,</a>  so right now, in the zoning ordinance, there's no specific definition that allows any type of brewery use. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5246.137s">What</a>  we did when we, going back to last year, and we started drafting this proposed ordinance, we looked at what some of the other cities and towns were doing and how they were classifying them. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5257.407s">And</a>  it seemed to be one of three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5260.93s">One,</a>  either they had a line item in the zoning table that did allow a specific brewery use, or they listed it as light manufacturing use. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5270.699s">We</a>  don't have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5272.526s">light</a>  manufacturing use defined in our zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5275.847s">We</a>  do have general manufacturing, but that's really what you consider as, you know, factory, typical factory use. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5282.888s">There's</a>  nothing that would allow brewery. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5285.269s">And</a>  the other thing that they were doing was they, some cities and towns were classifying as a restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5291.29s">And</a>  of course, it needs the state license, local pouring license and things like that, no matter what classification is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5299.232s">So</a>  we tried to, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5300.734s">you</a>  know, combine what we thought kind of like the best of both worlds for breweries. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5305.475s">So</a>  right now the definition is defined in the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5310.896s">Brewery</a>  is defined as an establishment primarily engaged in production and distribution of beer, ale, or other malt beverages, which may include accessory uses such as tours of the brewery, retail sales, and on-site consumption of the products. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5328.521s">For</a>  example, a tap room or a tasting room. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5332.168s">And</a>  as we just mentioned, the facilities should hold the appropriate Commonwealth of Massachusetts brewery license, as well as any required pouring license approved by a local licensing authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5343.051s">And</a>  also, this facility may host marketing events, special events, and brewery tours. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5349.373s">And</a>  the facility may only sell beverages produced by and commercial goods branded by the brewery. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5355.535s">So</a>  on this proposed ordinance, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5359.792s">In</a>  the table of use regulations, there are several districts which would allow this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5364.615s">So</a>  the first district that's classified as a commercial one, and it's abbreviated in our zoning as a C1 designation. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5373.521s">And</a>  the proposal would be yes to allow breweries operating with seven barrels or under. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5380.906s">And</a>  in the C1 district, it would be SPA, which is a special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5387.479s">for</a>  breweries operating with more than seven barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5391.042s">And</a>  for purposes of this ordinance, a barrel is defined as a container, which is usually cylindrical in nature, used for the storage of a malt beverage with a capacity of not more than 31 gallons. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5403.572s">And</a>  there's several other districts, four other districts that would be allowed by right, commercial two district, industrial district, <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5413.428s">an</a>  office district, and a mixed-use zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5417.009s">All</a>  four of those districts, the brewery would be allowed by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5420.729s">So</a>  the only one that would require any type of special permit is a commercial wine district. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5425.63s">And</a>  that would only be for if they were operating with more than seven barrels. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5433.131s">Also,</a>  on this paper, which I think we may need to kick this around a little bit tonight, whatever point you <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5443.878s">I'd</a>  like to address this, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5445.419s">There's</a>  a proposal by Councilor Morell to amend this. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5451.343s">And</a>  the amendment she proposed would be to add a definition of a brewpub. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5457.408s">And</a>  a brewpub would be an establishment that provides full on-site meal services and is also licensed to brew beer on the premises. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5466.054s">In</a>  addition to that, a brewpub shall sell 25% or more of its beer on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5472.103s">A</a>  brew pub shall be categorized as a restaurant and not a brewery for the purposes of zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5481.225s">Just</a>  checking the last page here, see if there's anything that's applicable for what we're gonna discuss tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5488.266s">And</a>  that's really the context of the proposed amendment that's before the board tonight.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5493.607s">All</a>  right, thank you, Mr. Moki. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5502.671s">Let's</a>  open it up to members of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5509.294s">I'd</a>  like to open the public portion of the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5514.956s">We</a>  did receive some written comments, a letter which I'll read right now from John Costas from the Metro Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5524.622s">dated</a>  September 15, 2020 to Andre Leroux, Chairman and the members of the Medford Community Development Board from Medford Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5532.846s">Regarding</a>  item four on the CDB's September 16, 2020 meeting agenda entitled Public Hearing Proposed Amendment to Chapter 94 Zoning to add definitions and use regulations relative to breweries. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5546.307s">The</a>  Medford Chamber of Commerce fully supports the City Council's proposed Ordinance Amendment of Article 1, Chapter 94 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of Medford as voted and passed by the City Council on July 28, 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5557.457s">It</a>  is the consensus of the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors that allowing breweries slash taprooms in C1 and C2 districts will encourage economic development and revitalization <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5569.608s">and</a>  that the proposed requirement that a special permit be required for breweries with greater than seven barrel production will also protect the neighborhoods from close proximity to large scale brewing operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5580.357s">It</a>  is also the consensus of the Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors that the council's proposed classification of brew pubs as restaurants will also encourage economic development and revitalization without negative impact on residential districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5595.48s">Therefore,</a>  the Medford Chamber of Commerce encourages the Community Development Board to approve the proposed ordinance amendment as voted by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5603.184s">Please</a>  note that the Chamber of Commerce would not be in support of excluding C-1 districts or requiring more restrictive special permit requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5611.629s">Sincerely,</a>  Medford Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5618.572s">At</a>  this time,</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5620.67s">And</a>  can I just make a technical clarification that this board is making a recommendation to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5627.731s">It</a>  is not approving or denying anything, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5631.392s">There's</a>  no authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5632.632s">It's</a>  just a recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5634.393s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5634.833s">When</a>  we receive papers from the city council like this, it is always for us to hold a public hearing and or make a recommendation back to them, which they may or may not follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5648.012s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5648.392s">I</a>  see some members of the public with their hands raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5651.474s">Annie,</a>  can you help me out? <a href="https://youtu.be/8Sqy8gyjolU&t=5654.436s">We</a>  have Nick Bolitho and John Costas.</p>
