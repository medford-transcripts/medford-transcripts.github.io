1
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:27,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, for the November 5th ballot, we'll have question six, question seven, question eight.

2
00:00:28,123 --> 00:00:39,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Question six is a debt exclusion, like I explained, is a tax that you'll be taxed until the project or the bond is complete, and then it comes off the tax.

3
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:41,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And that reads,

4
00:00:43,308 --> 00:01:12,039
[SPEAKER_00]: That exclusion on fire station shall the city of Medford be allowed to exempt from the provisions of proposition two and a half, so-called the amounts required to pay for the bonds issued in order to pay for costs of construction, a new fire station headquarters to be located at 120 Main Street in Medford, including the payment of all costs related design, the project equipping and furnishing, the project site improvements and all other costs

5
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,610
[SPEAKER_00]: incidental to related there too.

6
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:22,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll vote no, because that's been a lot of people's questions.

7
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,032
[SPEAKER_00]: George, I thought you supported the firefighters.

8
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:35,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you hear it straight from the people that I think Danielle put it perfectly when she said, we don't want to sound like the angry people.

9
00:01:36,694 --> 00:01:42,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, look to see what our firefighters have gone through, what our men and women have gone through in the last year.

10
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,270
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they've been treated.

11
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,651
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet again, they're gonna stand up and say what?

12
00:01:49,772 --> 00:02:01,575
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're offering was not transparent, was not inclusive, was a decision made in a box, and the funding is gonna hurt our residents.

13
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:05,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're willing to stand up and say what?

14
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:11,818
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd rather not have our residents of Medford hurt

15
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,825
[SPEAKER_00]: financially for an inferior product.

16
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:20,326
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do not vote for question six.

17
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:22,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Danielle.

18
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:32,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Question seven is funding schools and street repairs.

19
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:40,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall the city of Medford be allowed to assess an additional 3.5 million in real estate

20
00:02:41,368 --> 00:02:47,150
[SPEAKER_00]: and personal property taxes for FY25 general operations of the Medford Public Schools.

21
00:02:47,170 --> 00:03:07,577
[SPEAKER_00]: $3 million includes but not limited to funding costs for teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, administrative assistants, nurses, and for regular facility maintenance and for FY25 general operations DPW, including but not limited

22
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:15,610
[SPEAKER_00]: to additional staff for road and sidewalk infrastructure repair for fiscal year beginning July 1, 2024.

23
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this question seven.

24
00:03:22,214 --> 00:03:26,276
[SPEAKER_00]: $500,000, come on, for the roads and sidewalks.

25
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:38,443
[SPEAKER_00]: ARPA, when it was originally put forth, was directly supposed to go to infrastructure needs, roads and sidewalks.

26
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.

27
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:45,254
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we sit here and say we're going to give them $500.

28
00:03:45,334 --> 00:03:45,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

29
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,635
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an issue that I put forth years ago.

30
00:03:50,935 --> 00:04:02,218
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to put a sidewalk and hot tub crew together to save the city money because the mayor kept coming to us for $2.5 million bonds for sidewalks.

31
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:04,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never saw sidewalks being done.

32
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:05,659
[SPEAKER_00]: We could never catch up.

33
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,799
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know my colleagues say, see?

34
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:08,440
[SPEAKER_00]: See?

35
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,140
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right.

36
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,760
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no money.

37
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:11,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Not right.

38
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:12,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong.

39
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:19,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I love the dialogue.

40
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:27,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Public schools, teachers, literacy coaches, behavior specialists, nurses.

41
00:04:30,329 --> 00:04:38,833
[SPEAKER_00]: The superintendent has already, the expert in the state has shared some amazing information.

42
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:42,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we been resourceful?

43
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:49,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the school committee and the school department been resourceful in creating revenue?

44
00:04:50,982 --> 00:04:51,242
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

45
00:04:53,223 --> 00:04:59,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my colleagues will say, again, he's not telling the truth because their social media sites tell you that.

46
00:05:01,286 --> 00:05:07,908
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have shown everyone, very simple, meeting after meeting, and if you want to look up, watch them on YouTube,

47
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:17,896
[SPEAKER_00]: From step to step, we showed an avenue to come out of this without hurting kids or teachers or schools.

48
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:21,259
[SPEAKER_00]: We showed them that avenue through free cash.

49
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did they do?

50
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:27,444
[SPEAKER_00]: They imposed a rule to shut me up.

51
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:30,446
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we move forward.

52
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:36,491
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our members got a phone call from a school kid member.

53
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:38,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And that school kid member said,

54
00:05:39,144 --> 00:05:41,525
[SPEAKER_00]: How dare you put a no sign on your lawn?

55
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be happy when we lay off 40 teachers?

56
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:49,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Shame on that person.

57
00:05:51,429 --> 00:06:02,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the same exact question I posed in the open meeting in front of everybody and said, why put the schools, the children, the teachers through this?

58
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:05,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Take the $5 million out of free cash,

59
00:06:06,581 --> 00:06:15,168
[SPEAKER_00]: put the fear away, and then let's all get to the table and make the right decision for our community with an open and transparent process.

60
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, ladies and gentlemen, question seven, no.

61
00:06:31,361 --> 00:06:33,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the drama behind this.

62
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:35,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Question eight's intense.

63
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:36,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

64
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:38,902
[SPEAKER_00]: So question eight.

65
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:59,766
[SPEAKER_00]: This override will expand vocational programs and increase student access to the arts by giving us the funding to pay for new programming, staff to help students succeed, fix the school schedule at the level and increase educator and paraprofessional compensation to ensure living in competitive wages.

66
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:01,726
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't that sound expensive?

67
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:02,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Vocational.

68
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:15,711
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe what it is, Roy, you can help me if I'm wrong, is expanding the day, the school day, and the vocational day would kind of merge together.

69
00:07:15,731 --> 00:07:17,632
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're asking for, right?

70
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:24,435
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's maybe through negotiations will be the biggest cost.

71
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we're looking at

72
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,482
[SPEAKER_00]: is nothing close to $4 million.

73
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:33,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even close.

74
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:34,825
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even close.

75
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:37,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the trend here.

76
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:39,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, we heard.

77
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:42,091
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven and eight, education.

78
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:50,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand every single community that has fought for an override in their communities has used what?

79
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:54,053
[SPEAKER_00]: the children, and the schools.

80
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:58,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hurt our children, don't hurt our schools.

81
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:10,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I asked my colleagues, and we've heard people on the other side that's supporting this, where were you the meeting that you shut me up when we asked for free cash that we had?

82
00:08:13,944 --> 00:08:15,565
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were there, and you still have it.

83
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:20,288
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's understand this.

84
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:25,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you know the questions, let's go all the way back now.

85
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:30,410
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's make sure we get this and people can hear it, you can share it with your friends.

86
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:38,796
[SPEAKER_00]: All Medford, at no time have we ever said, we're against an override.

87
00:08:39,336 --> 00:08:41,017
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not want it, never.

88
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:43,198
[SPEAKER_00]: That was never said.

89
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:45,840
[SPEAKER_00]: What we said,

90
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,740
[SPEAKER_00]: was let's fix what's wrong now with that $5 million.

91
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring everybody together to the table.

92
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have an open and transparent process.

93
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:04,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's work together to make sure we, if the need is there, that we fulfill it together.

94
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,303
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't divide the community.

95
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,024
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is what has happened now.

96
00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:11,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're dividing.

97
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:13,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's yes or no.

98
00:09:13,605 --> 00:09:15,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest with you.

99
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:23,944
[SPEAKER_00]: As a responsible member of this community, if I didn't think now that we're here, there's nothing we can do, we'd have to step away, I'd step away.

100
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:27,986
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have $34 million in free cash.

101
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:38,889
[SPEAKER_00]: $34 million in free cash that has not been used that can recover this funding and make sure that we do this process correctly.

102
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,110
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're talking about.

103
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:43,551
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who don't know,

104
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:49,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick step-by-step so you understand it's never quick with me.

105
00:09:51,687 --> 00:09:54,369
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our budget meeting last year, the year before last.

106
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:09,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And my colleagues were in unison, Councilor Caviello was there, Council President Beas was there, and we were all together in the process that we cannot support this budget.

107
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:11,439
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too dangerous.

108
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,001
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were all for it.

109
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:29,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the night of the meeting, Councilor Carviello and I stood there, and our council leadership team came out and said, hey, we just met with the mayor behind closed doors, and we're gonna vote for the budget.

110
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:31,669
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come to an agreement.

111
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:32,409
[SPEAKER_00]: What agreement?

112
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what agreement it was.

113
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:39,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Carviello and Councilor Knight didn't know what agreement it was, but there was some sort of agreement.

114
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:43,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as this grew, we kind of realized what the agreement was.

115
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:47,046
[SPEAKER_00]: A financial task force was created.

116
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:56,073
[SPEAKER_00]: A school kid member, two city counselors, the chief of staff, and the mayor.

117
00:10:57,434 --> 00:11:03,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Five people with no background in financial battles.

118
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:04,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.

119
00:11:06,301 --> 00:11:11,125
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not enough to lead us to the spot we need to be.

120
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,630
[SPEAKER_00]: So we move forward.

121
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,091
[SPEAKER_00]: This financial task force is meeting.

122
00:11:15,111 --> 00:11:15,811
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't hear anything.

123
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:16,852
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no minutes.

124
00:11:17,592 --> 00:11:18,472
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no information.

125
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,234
[SPEAKER_00]: We're told we're going to get in a meeting before we do anything.

126
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:28,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you hear rumblings, so we call for a meeting.

127
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:30,598
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our city council meeting.

128
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:36,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it was the week before we had a subcommittee meeting, and a very smart red

129
00:11:40,776 --> 00:11:46,479
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, so if you ask for an override and it doesn't pass, what does that mean?

130
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,402
[SPEAKER_00]: That means devastation for the school department and our children.

131
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:55,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine.

132
00:11:56,644 --> 00:12:02,288
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came back the following week and I presented a plan that said what?

133
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:08,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Use our free cash, let's come to the table and do the right thing for our community.

134
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:13,558
[SPEAKER_00]: and let's not leverage our kids in our schools.

135
00:12:15,219 --> 00:12:18,021
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what happened?

136
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:19,121
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Rule 21.

137
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:23,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Council Scott Pelley shut down, can't speak.

138
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:27,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we're getting messages.

139
00:12:28,468 --> 00:12:31,350
[SPEAKER_00]: The Financial Task Force's plan was an override plan.

140
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,231
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what they came out with.

141
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:36,053
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked for the minutes, we asked for more information.

142
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:36,813
[SPEAKER_00]: How did we get there?

143
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:37,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was involved?

144
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:39,095
[SPEAKER_00]: No answer.

145
00:12:41,274 --> 00:12:45,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Now maybe the other side, because my friends are telling me, George, they're beating you up, they're beating you up.

146
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:46,158
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

147
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,740
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is all true.

148
00:12:49,921 --> 00:12:51,062
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all on tape.

149
00:12:54,886 --> 00:13:03,273
[SPEAKER_00]: So, typical fashion, Friday we get emails from the mayor's office with $7.5 million.

150
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:07,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesday we come to a meeting, we're gonna vote on it.

151
00:13:09,935 --> 00:13:21,018
[SPEAKER_00]: As a responsible city councilor, I will now invoke our Rule 21, close the meeting, and ask for an open meeting with everybody to talk about this in more depth.

152
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:34,741
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's unheard of, has never been heard of, never been done before, but our council leadership suspends the rules of the meeting and imposes a vote to not invoke Rule 21.

153
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:40,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Done, you can't talk about it.

154
00:13:40,897 --> 00:13:48,319
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell you, the council had five subcommittee meetings to talk about a city council newsletter.

155
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:49,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Five.

156
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what that, that's free, nothing.

157
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:59,082
[SPEAKER_00]: But, the paper's adding up to $7.5 million and possibly more.

158
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:01,883
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't wanna talk about it.

159
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:03,684
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what do we do?

160
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:06,303
[SPEAKER_00]: We move on to the next meeting and I said, okay.

161
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:10,805
[SPEAKER_00]: I reach out to my state representative and I asked him, what is the plan?

162
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:11,366
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do?

163
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:12,026
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, okay.

164
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:19,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal from the state said you can now invoke Mass General Law 43, section 22.

165
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,832
[SPEAKER_00]: That supersedes any method rule, shuts the meeting down.

166
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we get to the next meeting.

167
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Our leadership team does the same exact thing.

168
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Suspends the rules.

169
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:33,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Imposed, says they cannot impose rule 21.

170
00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:38,555
[SPEAKER_00]: I then invoke section 22.

171
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,336
[SPEAKER_00]: Council leadership says, no, you can't do that.

172
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:46,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Against the rule, against the law.

173
00:14:48,599 --> 00:14:50,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what was gonna be said is this.

174
00:14:53,141 --> 00:14:56,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And listen closely, because this is how real communities do it.

175
00:14:57,083 --> 00:15:03,706
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2009, working in the city of Somerville, Mayor Joe Curtatone was at a crossroads with his community.

176
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:06,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Big cuts looming.

177
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:19,511
[SPEAKER_00]: He convenes a group, a working group, a financial working group that consisted of financial minds from Tufts, MIT, Harvard, banking leaders.

178
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:24,194
[SPEAKER_00]: You had the Sloans from Century Bank.

179
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:27,176
[SPEAKER_00]: You had his financial team present.

180
00:15:28,357 --> 00:15:31,379
[SPEAKER_00]: You had community leaders and business leaders all in a row.

181
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:37,426
[SPEAKER_00]: And they worked on a plan because they said you needed to figure out three things before you wanted to go to an override.

182
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,348
[SPEAKER_00]: One, how do we get there?

183
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:43,870
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know how we got here.

184
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,692
[SPEAKER_00]: At least publicly, there's nothing been mentioned.

185
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:50,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, how do we fix it?

186
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:53,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, how does this never happen again?

187
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:56,216
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we were taught.

188
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:00,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they came out and they said, okay, this is what we're going to do.

189
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,057
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at traffic and parking fees.

190
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:05,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to make people happy, but they're going to take that money.

191
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,179
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to increase those fees.

192
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:13,780
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take that money, and that's going to be dedicated solely to the school department.

193
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.

194
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:15,661
[SPEAKER_00]: Need taken away.

195
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:16,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.

196
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:20,242
[SPEAKER_00]: We need streets and sidewalks.

197
00:16:20,282 --> 00:16:21,162
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we figure that out?

198
00:16:22,303 --> 00:16:27,744
[SPEAKER_00]: The focus is fees and fines for trash and building.

199
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:29,325
[SPEAKER_00]: And boom.

200
00:16:29,645 --> 00:16:30,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Developers pay for that.

201
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:38,750
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third piece, the most important piece, they sat together and they said, well, what can we do so this never happens again?

202
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,271
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we bring Somerville out of this?

203
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:43,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they started this little project called Assembly Row.

204
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:51,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, whether you like it or not, there's a lot of money coming into the city.

205
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:55,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, maybe you might question the growth, maybe question how they got there.

206
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:57,454
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm saying.

207
00:16:57,794 --> 00:17:00,615
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is, that was an open process

208
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:05,369
[SPEAKER_00]: with financial minds that sat together to find a solution.

209
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:14,375
[SPEAKER_00]: What has happened here, both in the fire department and the school department, it's been done in a vacuum.

210
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:16,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows.

211
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:29,866
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a member of the community did file a FOIA request asking information for, we're waiting on that, hopefully we get that soon, that we can share with the community of what

212
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:34,631
[SPEAKER_00]: was shared, minutes, any notes, anything taken with this financial group?

213
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:39,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Who were the professionals they might have brought in that we don't know that could have helped them?

214
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:40,095
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.

215
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:49,263
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are today, middle of September, people still don't know that there's an override vote.

216
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:55,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Councilor Caviello said, he had explained to a person yesterday, why are we fighting it?

217
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,050
[SPEAKER_00]: $7.5 million for a new high school?

218
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,951
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

219
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:02,505
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the problem.

220
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:04,946
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the problem.

221
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:11,389
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are saying, you know, but, you know, Councilor Scott Kelly shouldn't be doing this.

222
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:12,349
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a city councilor.

223
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:13,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit.

224
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:21,012
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to fight for what I think is right so every citizen is heard.

225
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:29,636
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will tell you, it's not that I'm new to this, or I wouldn't do this, or I wouldn't have the guts to do something like this, because

226
00:18:30,725 --> 00:18:53,811
[SPEAKER_00]: There were three former counselors in this room, and only one of them, sorry Rick, only one of them put forth a debt exclusion that was probably put together by the best financial mind in Medford, an Alicia Nunley, and we looked at the process of creating funding for a new main fire station on Main Street.

227
00:18:54,731 --> 00:18:55,671
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so simple.

228
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,424
[SPEAKER_00]: We would exclude senior citizens because you know what?

229
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:00,584
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hurting.

230
00:19:01,605 --> 00:19:02,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Senior citizens are hurting.

231
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:13,449
[SPEAKER_00]: The vulnerable community, our disabled, our veterans, eliminate that group, those groups, and see what we can do.

232
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:17,030
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe at the time it was $17 a month.

233
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,651
[SPEAKER_00]: We could swallow that, couldn't we?

234
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:22,743
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was with the process that gets started.

235
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with this process right now, nobody knows what's going on.

236
00:19:26,046 --> 00:19:27,347
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't know what's happening.

237
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:30,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's been posted.

238
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:36,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's rumblings that money's already being spent from free cash out of $34 million.

239
00:19:37,194 --> 00:19:38,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's been done yet.

240
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:44,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So having this meeting tonight is so important, this fundraiser's so important.

241
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I tell you, I gotta thank so many people.

242
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:49,424
[SPEAKER_00]: The restaurants that donated,

243
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:56,596
[SPEAKER_00]: LaCasha's, Ronnie's Place, Richie Razzo's from Razzo's and Avellino's always donate.

244
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:58,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

245
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:08,039
[SPEAKER_00]: The thousands of dollars that were donated just the other day was amazing.

246
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,540
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess where that money's coming from?

247
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:12,641
[SPEAKER_00]: You.

248
00:20:14,268 --> 00:20:18,929
[SPEAKER_00]: hard-working, method residents that want to do anything they can and fight.

249
00:20:19,729 --> 00:20:25,130
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor, who's 84 years old, came to my house today and said, George, I can't come.

250
00:20:25,871 --> 00:20:27,051
[SPEAKER_00]: He has $8.

251
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:27,051
$8.

252
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:33,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, God, no, no, no.

253
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:41,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I tell you, what we do know is Kelly has done a great job with the real estate side and understanding the assessing side.

254
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:54,194
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Nate Merritt's been doing his deep dive into the calculator that they have on their site that says all you do is poke in these numbers, bam, it's always this much money, you can handle that.

255
00:20:55,314 --> 00:20:55,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullshit.

256
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:08,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm gonna tell you straight up, $380 for a person might sound not a lot of money, but some of the people I've talked to,

257
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:12,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep saying it, I won't use her last name, but I love her dearly.

258
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:13,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Mrs. Jones.

259
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:16,218
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, George, help me understand this.

260
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:20,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought my house 50, 60 years ago.

261
00:21:21,721 --> 00:21:23,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So $48,000, I believe she said.

262
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:24,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I tell people $50,000.

263
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:29,025
[SPEAKER_00]: But now my house is worth a million dollars.

264
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:31,947
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband died 15 years ago.

265
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:33,248
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a seamstress.

266
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:36,850
[SPEAKER_00]: My social security doesn't cover my taxes.

267
00:21:38,111 --> 00:21:38,791
[SPEAKER_00]: So should I move?

268
00:21:40,296 --> 00:21:41,737
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people want them to do that.

269
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:45,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I haven't heard one thing supporting our senior citizens.

270
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:51,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard one thing how we're gonna help those homeowners that are struggling to stay in their homes.

271
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuz one of my council colleagues actually said to me is, if your house is worth a million dollars, just take a hundred out.

272
00:21:58,663 --> 00:21:59,303
[SPEAKER_00]: That simple.

273
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:04,785
[SPEAKER_00]: The understanding of not understanding what a home equity line is, that's devastating.

274
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:07,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Devastating for a resident.

275
00:22:09,946 --> 00:22:11,467
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not candy coating anything.

276
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:13,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hiding anything.

277
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:15,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you see has been public.

278
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:21,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I have told my council colleagues what they're doing is dangerous to our community.

279
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:25,372
[SPEAKER_00]: We still don't see the information how we got here.

280
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:28,934
[SPEAKER_00]: The way they want to get out of it is by taxing.

281
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:29,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the other piece.

282
00:22:30,254 --> 00:22:33,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it's only this much money.

283
00:22:33,616 --> 00:22:36,017
[SPEAKER_00]: If I hear that again from people, I'm going to lose my mind.

284
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Because understand this, and I'll end with this.

285
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:42,618
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we talk about one of our first meetings subcommittee?

286
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:43,959
[SPEAKER_00]: Rent control.

287
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talked about a transfer tax.

288
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:49,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we talked about a registry fee.

289
00:22:50,965 --> 00:22:53,647
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we talked about overrides.

290
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:57,870
[SPEAKER_00]: But it stops there, right?

291
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.

292
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:04,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my brother, I'll use my brother for example, just got his house assessed.

293
00:23:05,096 --> 00:23:06,257
[SPEAKER_00]: An additional $400 a month.

294
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:12,042
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, he's a young man, works very hard.

295
00:23:12,062 --> 00:23:14,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, he can recover.

296
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:25,310
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, Kelly did some homework, and we found out his assessment in 20 to 24 that's starting now, he thinks it's over with the assessment side.

297
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,332
[SPEAKER_00]: But Kelly, what are we hearing?

298
00:23:27,412 --> 00:23:36,877
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2025, you're gonna get the sales data for 2023, because the peak of the real estate market will pass your home.

299
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:40,222
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going up again.

300
00:23:41,382 --> 00:23:43,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So have we heard any of that in their homework?

301
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:45,205
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

302
00:23:46,746 --> 00:23:47,767
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only $400.

303
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,989
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go a step further.

304
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,512
[SPEAKER_00]: A minimum $200 million renovated high school.

305
00:23:57,793 --> 00:23:58,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Who fits that bill?

306
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:00,075
[SPEAKER_00]: You.

307
00:24:01,896 --> 00:24:03,157
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a new high school.

308
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:04,017
[SPEAKER_00]: A new one.

309
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:06,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it down to one new high school.

310
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:07,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at $400 million.

311
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:12,347
[SPEAKER_00]: You people don't understand what that number equates to.

312
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,188
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dangerous.

313
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:18,210
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scary and it's dangerous.

314
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:24,554
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't want to bring you out to scare you, but I brought you out to wake you up.

315
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:28,396
[SPEAKER_00]: This group never wanted to say no to an override.

316
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:35,440
[SPEAKER_00]: But we heard it from the smartest educational mind that I've been around.

317
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:46,743
[SPEAKER_00]: that we haven't seen enough creativity, we haven't seen enough information, and there has been no transparency to show that we need this.

318
00:24:48,724 --> 00:24:53,806
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked to our fire department, our firefighters are saying, don't hurt our residents.

319
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't build something just to check a box.

320
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:00,688
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want the fire station.

321
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:01,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.

322
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:04,069
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're saying it,

323
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,853
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've spelt it out for everybody.

324
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,074
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple process right now.

325
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:17,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix the budget with $5 million in free cash.

326
00:25:18,878 --> 00:25:21,619
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move forward and think of different ways to be creative.

327
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be shocking and look at new growth and development.

328
00:25:26,801 --> 00:25:27,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we haven't seen.

329
00:25:27,922 --> 00:25:30,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I lying, Ricky?

330
00:25:31,003 --> 00:25:32,624
[SPEAKER_00]: How many 40B jobs did we lose?

331
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:37,454
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, how much money just in permits with those three projects?

332
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:39,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Millions of dollars.

333
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,837
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tax revenue.

334
00:25:41,197 --> 00:25:42,758
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done the homework on it.

335
00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:43,318
[SPEAKER_00]: How much?

336
00:25:43,338 --> 00:25:43,818
[SPEAKER_00]: $16 million.

337
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:44,739
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one building.

338
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,680
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, these aren't lies.

339
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,040
[SPEAKER_00]: These are true numbers.

340
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:49,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you wish you had a platform

341
00:26:02,557 --> 00:26:04,177
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been shut up way too easy.

342
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:06,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this forum, I'm not.

343
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:07,138
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're my voice.

344
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:09,178
[SPEAKER_00]: You're helping us spread the message now.

345
00:26:10,118 --> 00:26:11,179
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what we need.

346
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,119
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a list right now of over 600 volunteers.

347
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,860
[SPEAKER_00]: 600 volunteers.

348
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:26,921
[SPEAKER_00]: We have captains that are going to be doing standouts that we have about, what, 60 to 80 people?

349
00:26:26,941 --> 00:26:30,062
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 to 80 people already signed up to do standouts.

350
00:26:31,513 --> 00:26:37,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asking all of you, October 15th, Zach, if you wanna come on out, we're gonna meet at Hormel Stadium.

351
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:49,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's gonna come out and we're gonna take our message and we're gonna go to the neighborhoods and we're gonna knock on doors and we're gonna give people the information that no one in the city has given them to help them understand.

352
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:53,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the rest of everybody else, don't be afraid.

353
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,661
[SPEAKER_00]: If a school kid member knocks on your door, it's a shame on you beyond that you have the information right now.

354
00:27:00,765 --> 00:27:02,366
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond that you know the truth.

355
00:27:06,007 --> 00:27:15,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomorrow, when you go to the coffee shop, or tomorrow when you go next door and you talk to Dave and have a cold drink, sit down with him and say, hey, do you know about the overrides?

356
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:24,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the fire don't want it, the educational minds think it's absurd, and it's going to hurt people.

357
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:29,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the other piece that I seem to forget, and I don't ever want to forget this.

358
00:27:32,054 --> 00:27:34,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I have lived in a, grew up in a home with tenants.

359
00:27:35,775 --> 00:27:42,796
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad made sure that we treated our tenants with pride and with respect, and we made sure we kept our rent reasonable.

360
00:27:43,877 --> 00:27:48,438
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that my brother took that, and we still have the same family there that have been there for 10 years.

361
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:52,619
[SPEAKER_00]: That family pays for a four bedroom in Medford.

362
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:53,639
[SPEAKER_00]: They pay $2,400.

363
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cheap.

364
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:56,860
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that.

365
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,640
[SPEAKER_00]: He will not raise that rate.

366
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:08,663
[SPEAKER_00]: What people have to understand, if these taxes come about, taxpayers cannot handle this on their own.

367
00:28:09,504 --> 00:28:14,067
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be passed down to the tenants, and renters are going to go through the roof.

368
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:19,790
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank all of you for coming out tonight.

369
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I miss anything, Rick?

370
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:22,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure?

371
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:23,732
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my captain.

372
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:24,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick's going to tell me.

373
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:26,814
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, I will tell you,

374
00:28:27,196 --> 00:28:28,937
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got great people working on this.

375
00:28:29,337 --> 00:28:30,738
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited for the energy.

376
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we have 260 signs already on the street.

377
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve's gone.

378
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:42,063
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 260 signs on the street, and we have another 200 here tonight.

379
00:28:43,363 --> 00:28:49,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you take your sign, but make sure you leave your name and your address so we know you've taken it.

380
00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:54,768
[SPEAKER_00]: And show your neighbors and just give us a call, just so people know.

381
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:55,929
[SPEAKER_00]: An override.

382
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:12,376
[SPEAKER_00]: When you vote for an override and we give the mayor $6 million, even though they say that the money is going to go to the vocational school or art programs, that's not necessarily true.

383
00:29:13,476 --> 00:29:18,577
[SPEAKER_00]: The money goes into the general fund to be used to the mayor's discretion.

384
00:29:18,597 --> 00:29:23,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so again, there's a reason why we're here.

385
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:24,739
[SPEAKER_00]: $9 million

386
00:29:28,382 --> 00:29:29,223
[SPEAKER_00]: in free cash.

387
00:29:30,183 --> 00:29:43,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people that want to know real simple what free cash is, free cash is the money that we approve for the prior year in the budget that the mayor does not use, does not spend, and then it gets certified and carried over.

388
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:48,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes into an account that she can do anything she wants with it.

389
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:51,058
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.

390
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope tonight what we really wanted to do is educate some people.

391
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,302
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them out, have them know what's going on.

392
00:30:01,962 --> 00:30:07,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that we'll be having, if you please sign up for the standouts, we'll be doing door knocking.

393
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:13,511
[SPEAKER_00]: But the big one is gonna be October 15th, Saturday, nine o'clock at Formell Stadium.

394
00:30:14,031 --> 00:30:17,594
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be meeting there and we're all gonna be hitting the streets.

395
00:30:18,154 --> 00:30:19,755
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be going into the neighborhoods.

396
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:27,861
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna be knocking on the doors, talking to your neighbors and letting them know that if this is voted through, it's not gonna hurt the children.

397
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:40,412
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor's just gonna have to put the money that she's playing with back to where it's supposed to be and help our children and help our schools and help our seniors and our residents so they don't get killed with these taxes.

398
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:43,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you all for coming.

399
00:30:43,073 --> 00:30:45,693
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a safe ride home and we'll talk to you soon.
