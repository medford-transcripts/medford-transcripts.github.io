1
00:00:00,841 --> 00:00:04,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Do roll call here for the ad hoc small cell committee, Paul Moki.

2
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:05,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:08,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Mariano Connor.

4
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:09,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

5
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:11,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia hunt.

6
00:00:12,214 --> 00:00:12,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

7
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:17,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And me I'm present I will introduce those folks down the agenda, when we get to that.

8
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:33,681
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will now call to order this meeting of the ad hoc small cell committee to hold hearings for Verizon applications for nine proposed small cell infrastructure sites in the city of Medford.

9
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:41,966
[SPEAKER_05]: The first order of business is to approve the minutes from September 23rd, 2021.

10
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:47,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Those minutes were distributed to the committee and

11
00:00:50,055 --> 00:00:51,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully had a chance to take a look at them.

12
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I hear a motion to approve those minutes?

13
00:01:02,285 --> 00:01:03,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Marianne moved.

14
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:08,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paul second.

15
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:10,191
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'll second that.

16
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:11,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

17
00:01:11,913 --> 00:01:15,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And can I get a roll call vote, Alicia Hunt?

18
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:18,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

19
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:20,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

20
00:01:21,504 --> 00:01:21,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Marianne.

21
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

22
00:01:24,427 --> 00:01:24,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul.

23
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:25,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

24
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:27,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a yes as well.

25
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:28,570
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

26
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,153
[SPEAKER_05]: The minutes are approved for September 23rd, 2021.

27
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:38,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Next order of business is the introduction.

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first part of that is the welcome.

29
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,344
[SPEAKER_05]: So just welcome everybody.

30
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming tonight.

31
00:01:46,488 --> 00:01:51,649
[SPEAKER_05]: We are operating under the interim policy for small cell wireless installations here in Medford.

32
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So we operate under that policy.

33
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:59,251
[SPEAKER_05]: And that policy is a result of an FCC declaratory ruling and order.

34
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:08,094
[SPEAKER_05]: The committee is comprised of Paul Moki, building commissioner, Marianne O'Connor, director of public health, Alicia Hunt.

35
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,075
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my old notes here, Alicia.

36
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:15,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

37
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:15,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I get that right?

38
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And then myself, Tim McGibbon, City Engineer, and now currently the acting DPW Commissioner.

39
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:33,179
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to consider the following locations Verizon has applied for under the City of Medford interim policy for small cell wireless installations.

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,041
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just read off those locations quickly.

41
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:43,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Locations are a pole on Franklin Street, pole number 1455.

42
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:48,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Poll on South Street, 84 South Street, poll 1227.

43
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:48,883
[SPEAKER_05]: 15, Reardon Road, poll 2421.

44
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:49,843
[SPEAKER_05]: 60, Oakland Street, poll 204.

45
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,544
[SPEAKER_05]: 84, Paris Street, poll 2087.

46
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:52,764
[SPEAKER_05]: 167, Grant Avenue, poll 1876.

47
00:02:52,984 --> 00:02:55,425
[SPEAKER_05]: 33, Grant Avenue, poll 4447.

48
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:56,826
[SPEAKER_05]: 103, Otis Street, poll 1333.

49
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:18,670
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 Daniel Street, pole number 2939.

50
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,871
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

51
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,855
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is also the order that we will take these.

52
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:40,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, as stated in the policy, the FCC declaratory ruling significantly limits the ability of cities and towns to regulate small cell wireless.

53
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:53,348
[SPEAKER_05]: The committee's purview is limited to the policy and is not able to consider concerns such as potential health impacts or whether or not the FCC standards do what they are supposed to do.

54
00:03:54,069 --> 00:04:04,035
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, if you are here because of health-related concerns, we recommend that you contact your state and federal legislatures as this law comes from the federal level of government.

55
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:07,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't do much there.

56
00:04:07,897 --> 00:04:08,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a lot of people,

57
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,730
[SPEAKER_05]: have health concerns.

58
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in our purview.

59
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:13,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Just gonna make that clear right up front.

60
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:19,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also like to state up front that the city does not choose locations.

61
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:26,074
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Verizon selects these locations based off of, you know, whatever work they do.

62
00:04:26,915 --> 00:04:31,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they propose those locations for approval pursuant to the city policy.

63
00:04:33,436 --> 00:04:35,237
[SPEAKER_05]: And then previous meetings,

64
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:49,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm talking to the committee here, previous meetings we've had Robin give an overview of the FCC declaratory ruling and what is not within our preview and why.

65
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:58,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not ask Robin if she would be available to make that statement today, but does the committee feel we should ask her to do that now?

66
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:01,608
[SPEAKER_05]: or anything like that.

67
00:05:01,648 --> 00:05:08,153
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel pretty comfortable not doing that at this time, unless, you know, other committee members feel like we should.

68
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:11,756
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, Tim, I think you explained that very well.

69
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:17,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a several, we've had several meetings on this before.

70
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:19,222
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the word is out there.

71
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:20,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I think you explained it pretty well.

72
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:24,587
[SPEAKER_11]: I personally don't see the need to include her at this point.

73
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:28,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and there's also going to be questions and comments.

74
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:35,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So folks have specific questions that we need to get further information from Robin.

75
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure she's available for that.

76
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:38,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm OK moving forward.

77
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:42,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'll wait for any other objections or advice.

78
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:42,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Good?

79
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:45,494
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I'm seeing nods.

80
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:46,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will move forward.

81
00:05:47,675 --> 00:05:48,895
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I'm going to summarize the agenda.

82
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:52,503
[SPEAKER_05]: After this introduction, Verizon is going to make a presentation.

83
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:56,685
[SPEAKER_05]: After the presentation, the committee members will be given an opportunity to ask questions.

84
00:05:56,705 --> 00:06:02,907
[SPEAKER_05]: There will then be a public comment period for non-site-specific or general comments.

85
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:08,049
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I'm going to call on the voices in favor of the applications, and then I'll call on the voices in opposition.

86
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,231
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone who speaks is going to receive approximately two minutes.

87
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:13,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, two minutes.

88
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:17,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And questions to Verizon should be directed to the chair, me.

89
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:22,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So the questions will go to the chair to Verizon to get answers or information.

90
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:28,779
[SPEAKER_05]: After this public comment period, we're gonna discuss each application location in the order that I read them.

91
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,963
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after the committee discusses, the public will be able to make site specific comments.

92
00:06:33,323 --> 00:06:34,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that'll be two minutes per speaker.

93
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:38,909
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be more discussion by the committee before moving on to a motion.

94
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:49,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair will open the floor for a motion by a committee member to vote on the applications one at a time on the locations when it's not.

95
00:06:50,604 --> 00:06:59,028
[SPEAKER_05]: In the motion carries the chair will indicate them that the members may grant grant with conditions or deny each applications and the vote will be taken via roll call.

96
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:02,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Rules of the hearing overview of the process.

97
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:10,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Use the raise hand function if you'd like to comment during the public participation periods please direct comments and questions to the chair me.

98
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,703
[SPEAKER_05]: No profanity, no name calling or other rude or disruptive behavior.

99
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:20,247
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair reserves the right to unmute participants who become disruptive to the proceedings.

100
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:23,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Each speaker during participation will receive two minutes.

101
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:27,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And this meeting will go until 10 p.m.

102
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:28,233
[SPEAKER_05]: at the latest.

103
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's our cutoff.

104
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:33,978
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have not completed the agenda by 10 p.m., we'll look for a motion to continue the hearing to a date certain.

105
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:35,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's nine.

106
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:39,390
[SPEAKER_05]: tonight and before I think we finished in plenty of time with 18.

107
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not seeing that being an issue tonight.

108
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, I'd like to introduce the mapped locations.

109
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:52,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So to assist in this discussion, we've mapped all the proposed locations that's available on our website.

110
00:07:53,702 --> 00:08:02,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will be using that map during our proceedings tonight as we have in other proceedings for these applications, these types of applications.

111
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:08,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, that map for all applications so far is on the city's website.

112
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:13,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So please go there if you're looking to see where all the antennas are so far.

113
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:16,284
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is the third round.

114
00:08:16,324 --> 00:08:17,766
[SPEAKER_05]: There was 44, then there was 18, and then nine tonight.

115
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:26,099
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, with all that said, we'll now move on to the presentation by Verizon.

116
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:41,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to ask the applicants to introduce their team to the committee as well as the folks who are here tonight and present the nine applications that we'll be reviewing.

117
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:46,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after the presentation, we may ask questions before going into the public comment period.

118
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:50,288
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so I will hand it over to Verizon for your presentation.

119
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:56,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

120
00:08:56,502 --> 00:09:00,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Tim Torowski from Robinson & Cole representing the applicant, Verizon Wireless.

121
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:12,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I first want to extend thanks to the committee members for hearing us this evening and your continued efforts in hearing these many applications over these past several months.

122
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:13,985
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.

123
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:24,587
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to begin by saying that for folks in the audience who may want additional information on

124
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:39,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Verizon's ongoing small cell application in the town of Medford, we have established a website that contains additional information for the benefit of folks who may be listening by phone and not in front of a screen.

125
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:51,390
[SPEAKER_00]: The website address is improveyourwireless, and that's all one word, improveyourwireless.com backslash Medford.

126
00:09:52,798 --> 00:10:00,883
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have an email address for folks who want to ask questions of Verizon with regard to the small cell program in Medford.

127
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:20,655
[SPEAKER_00]: That email address, again, I'll read for the benefit of folks on the phone, is vzw.medford.small.cell.program at Verizon Wireless, all one word, .com.

128
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:22,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.

129
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:33,181
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now let me introduce the panel that will be presenting and answering questions on behalf of Verizon Wireless this evening.

130
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:37,904
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already met myself, Tim Turowski, as legal counsel for Verizon.

131
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:43,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with us this evening is Stan Yusevich, who is with Verizon Wireless Governmental Affairs.

132
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:49,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Flanagan is a radio frequency engineer for Verizon.

133
00:10:50,152 --> 00:10:51,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Sean Conway,

134
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:58,970
[SPEAKER_00]: who is an engineer for Verizon, and Dr. Eric Swanson, professor of physics at the University of Pittsburgh.

135
00:10:59,891 --> 00:11:00,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.

136
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:06,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal requirements for small cell deployments.

137
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:11,117
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the chair touched upon some of these issues briefly, so I'll go through these very quickly.

138
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:21,202
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, Medford has adopted an interim small cell policy, which is controlling to the extent that it is not inconsistent with federal law.

139
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:25,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the federal laws of relevance this evening.

140
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:32,014
[SPEAKER_00]: The first federal law imposes a 60-day time limit to approve or deny small cell applications.

141
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in this case we've already passed that time frame.

142
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:41,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Verizon has agreed to extend that deadline to December 1st.

143
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:48,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, federal law controls to the extent to which

144
00:11:49,352 --> 00:11:52,815
[SPEAKER_00]: state and local governments can regulate the design of small cells.

145
00:11:55,417 --> 00:12:04,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal law also prohibits municipalities from placing a moratorium on small cell deployment or prohibiting service from particular areas.

146
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:06,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly,

147
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:13,145
[SPEAKER_00]: federal law says that municipalities may not evaluate small cell applications based on health concerns.

148
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,627
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an issue that the chair has already touched upon.

149
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:21,952
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, let me turn the presentation over to, I believe, Sean Conway.

150
00:12:22,733 --> 00:12:23,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

151
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:27,577
[SPEAKER_10]: We're actually going to go to Stan at this point.

152
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:43,852
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Stan Yusevich, State Government Affairs with Verizon, and I want to thank the Ad Hoc Committee for their time, their commitment, and their approach to these hearings.

153
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:48,796
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, Verizon has been making a significant investment in

154
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,980
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure as we have in neighboring communities.

155
00:12:55,001 --> 00:13:02,468
[SPEAKER_01]: In recent years, Verizon started bringing the next generation of wireless technology to the region's largest cities like Boston.

156
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:06,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're expanding into new cities and towns.

157
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:10,154
[SPEAKER_01]: We've chosen Medford to provide better wireless coverage.

158
00:13:10,815 --> 00:13:15,899
[SPEAKER_01]: This effort is to better serve your residents, school children, and businesses.

159
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:24,885
[SPEAKER_01]: The applications we've submitted are a continuation to provide these benefits to neighborhoods of Medford.

160
00:13:26,946 --> 00:13:38,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Our plan, however, will provide improved wireless services for the entire city.

161
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:39,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Next slide, please.

162
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:45,289
[SPEAKER_01]: We've all witnessed the rapid growth in demand of wireless services.

163
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:52,911
[SPEAKER_01]: This demand for wireless technology has increased dramatically since COVID-19 and its outbreak.

164
00:13:53,952 --> 00:13:58,153
[SPEAKER_01]: People are working from their homes and children are being educated remotely.

165
00:13:58,853 --> 00:14:05,655
[SPEAKER_01]: As we see from tonight's hearing, technology is making it possible for important work of local government to continue.

166
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:06,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Slide.

167
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Wireless technology has quickly progressed since the first cell phones were introduced.

168
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:20,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Each generation of cell phone technology has expanded capabilities.

169
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:26,316
[SPEAKER_01]: The second generation technology enabled us to view emails from our phones.

170
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:34,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And the third generation brought us GPS enabling devices to our phones and helped us navigate.

171
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:38,060
[SPEAKER_01]: 4G technology enabled streaming of videos.

172
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are migrating to the fifth generation of 5G technology.

173
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:48,147
[SPEAKER_01]: That will greatly enhance the speed and capability of our cell phones.

174
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:48,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Slide.

175
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:53,010
[SPEAKER_01]: The promise and benefit of 5G is bright.

176
00:14:53,754 --> 00:15:09,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Collectively, we can imagine and create opportunities for greater energy efficiency in our buildings, traffic signaling coordination, communication reliability for our first responders, and increased access for remote learning.

177
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:10,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Slide.

178
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:10,125
[SPEAKER_01]: 5G

179
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:21,055
[SPEAKER_01]: The 5G economy will have a significant impact on America's cities and towns, large and small, over the next 10 years.

180
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:33,425
[SPEAKER_01]: We will see the benefits across the country, including over $43 billion in economic growth and the creation of 100,000 new jobs in Massachusetts alone.

181
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:35,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Slide.

182
00:15:36,808 --> 00:15:53,130
[SPEAKER_01]: A May 2021 research study asked home buyers what they prioritize when it came to new homes and it's clear that home buyers prioritize 5G and high speed internet in an eight out of 10.

183
00:15:55,084 --> 00:16:00,606
[SPEAKER_01]: And having 5G home internet makes a home far more valuable.

184
00:16:01,346 --> 00:16:14,090
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the past year, realtors are also fielding more questions from homeowners about home buyers, I should say, about the access to broadband home internet and cellular service.

185
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:14,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Slide.

186
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:32,037
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the home buyers prioritize fast reliable home internet, and that good cellular service over one appliances nearby attractions in amenities commute time and good schools have been trumped.

187
00:16:32,878 --> 00:16:38,622
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the reasons we are here, and these are the reasons why you have these applications before you.

188
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:44,027
[SPEAKER_01]: I respectfully ask for your support and approval of these applications.

189
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I thank you again for your time and appreciate your service to the community.

190
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, I'll turn it to Jason Flanagan, Verizon engineer.

191
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I got double muted.

192
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:08,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Jason Flanagan, and I'm the radio frequency engineer for the city of Medford.

193
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:14,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Here on the screen is an example of what coverage will look like from one of the 5G nodes we're proposing today.

194
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:21,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Our 4G frequencies are much lower than our 5G frequencies, so they don't travel as far as they used to.

195
00:17:22,628 --> 00:17:26,449
[SPEAKER_07]: This is similar to hearing a car driving by with a loud stereo.

196
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,750
[SPEAKER_07]: First, you hear with the low bass frequencies, and then as you get closer, you hear the higher voice frequencies.

197
00:17:31,923 --> 00:17:35,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Next we have Sean Conway with some sighting information.

198
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:40,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Jason.

199
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:41,168
[SPEAKER_10]: And good evening, everyone.

200
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:42,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having us here tonight.

201
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:50,412
[SPEAKER_10]: As Jason showed on the last slide, we have an area where we need to go out and now select a location to add our antennas to the network.

202
00:17:51,713 --> 00:18:00,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So the real estate team goes out, uses the guidelines set forth by the utility companies to select a pole that will work to attach our equipment.

203
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:10,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Our current small cell in the city of Medford will look very similar to what we have on the slide here, where at the top of the pole, there are antennas and radios.

204
00:18:11,017 --> 00:18:12,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Midway down, there's a fiber connection.

205
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:20,946
[SPEAKER_10]: A little bit below that, we have our power disconnect, which allows any workers to go out and turn the site off if they need to go and work on the utility pole.

206
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:27,932
[SPEAKER_10]: And then just below that, we have a power meter, which will do the readings for all of our, for the electricity we use there.

207
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:33,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Our standard designs are currently on utility poles, street lights, and traffic signals.

208
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:37,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything we're doing in Medford is currently on utility poles.

209
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:47,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And as to the size of the antennas, just to give you an idea, the antennas here, and for all nine of these applications, are at the top of the utility pole.

210
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:51,666
[SPEAKER_10]: And the size of the antenna is about the size of a small parking sign.

211
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:55,988
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can see, we have a city of Boston parking sign next to one of the antennas there on the right-hand side.

212
00:18:57,592 --> 00:19:05,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I would also like to add that all nine of these applications have the antennas attached above 33 feet on the pole.

213
00:19:06,675 --> 00:19:09,956
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of these locations meet the current ADA requirements.

214
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:15,218
[SPEAKER_10]: At this point, I'd like to pass it on to Dr. Eric Swanson to talk about RF.

215
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:24,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee and everyone in the public who's tuned in.

216
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,455
[SPEAKER_06]: My name's Eric Swanson.

217
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:31,079
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been asked by Verizon to talk to you about the health effects of this infrastructure.

218
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:34,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a few words about myself so you know where I'm coming from.

219
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:36,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a professor of physics.

220
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:39,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a fellow of the American Physical Society.

221
00:19:39,105 --> 00:19:41,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a member of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

222
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:46,712
[SPEAKER_06]: I spend a good part of my life about five miles south of you.

223
00:19:48,235 --> 00:19:57,980
[SPEAKER_06]: The main message I'd like to get here is that what I'm presenting is the consensus scientific view on the health effects of this infrastructure.

224
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So slide, please, Sean.

225
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:08,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you know, cell phones operate with electromagnetic waves.

226
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:12,587
[SPEAKER_06]: They're small radios, and the receivers are small radio receivers.

227
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:17,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Those electromagnetic waves form what's called the spectrum.

228
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:18,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what this graph indicates here.

229
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,292
[SPEAKER_06]: The spectrum can be organized in a few different ways.

230
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:24,514
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is the wavelength of the waves involved.

231
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:26,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one is the frequency of the waves.

232
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:31,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are just like wavelength and frequency that you'd associate with, say, ocean waves.

233
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:32,320
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the same.

234
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of this is very familiar to us.

235
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's broken out there in the middle is the visible part of the spectrum that makes the rainbow.

236
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:42,962
[SPEAKER_06]: That is visible light is electromagnetic waves.

237
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:53,783
[SPEAKER_06]: As you go lower in frequency or longer in wavelengths, you get other familiar parts like infrared radiation or microwaves or radio waves.

238
00:20:54,724 --> 00:21:01,465
[SPEAKER_06]: As you go higher in frequency, we also hit familiar things like ultraviolet sunlight, for instance, x-rays or gamma rays.

239
00:21:02,325 --> 00:21:02,985
[SPEAKER_06]: So next slide.

240
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we're talking about tonight is around in this green blob here.

241
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,739
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where 5G sits in terms of the frequency or the wavelength.

242
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And I should just point out that that frequency is about a factor of 30,000 times below that of visible light.

243
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:21,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And that'll become relevant in just a minute.

244
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:22,650
[SPEAKER_06]: So next slide.

245
00:21:25,466 --> 00:21:46,155
[SPEAKER_06]: some of this radiation the high frequency also high energy radiation is what's called ionizing and what that means is that that radiation has sufficient energy that it can strip electrons from atoms now sometimes that doesn't matter it doesn't matter if you boil an electron off of the pavement but if it happens to be an electron that's associated with

246
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:50,056
[SPEAKER_06]: a biomolecule in your skin cell that could cause damage.

247
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,776
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're familiar with this at an intuitive level.

248
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:56,517
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that sunlight has a lot of UVA and UVB in it.

249
00:21:56,937 --> 00:22:04,358
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you spend too long outside, your skin will tan because it's reacting to the damage that's caused by the UVA and UVB.

250
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide, please.

251
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:09,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

252
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:12,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, below that is non-ionizing radiation.

253
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:18,308
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a threshold between ionizing and non-ionizing, lying just between UV and visible.

254
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:24,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Those waves don't have enough energy to ionize atoms.

255
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:30,795
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't strip electrons off of material, including molecules in our skin.

256
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means that they can't damage DNA.

257
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:39,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means that these waves can't do things like cause cancer, which is a common concern that people have.

258
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:47,494
[SPEAKER_06]: And a very important point here is it doesn't matter how intense that radiation is, and it doesn't matter how long you're exposed to it for.

259
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:48,935
[SPEAKER_06]: And next slide.

260
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:54,879
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is actually also known to everybody at an intuitive level.

261
00:22:55,417 --> 00:23:01,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you sit underneath artificial lights, artificial lights produce light in the visible part of the spectrum.

262
00:23:01,938 --> 00:23:04,439
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't produce the damaging UV radiation.

263
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:06,999
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that you can sit underneath those lights.

264
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,480
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter how long you sit under them for.

265
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:10,900
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get tan.

266
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,441
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't get tan sitting inside.

267
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:16,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Similarly, it doesn't matter how bright that light is.

268
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:17,502
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't make you tan.

269
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:21,062
[SPEAKER_06]: If you make an artificial light bright enough, it'll heat you up.

270
00:23:22,223 --> 00:23:23,983
[SPEAKER_06]: But it won't make you tan.

271
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:26,896
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so let's go on from there.

272
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:33,502
[SPEAKER_06]: So here are a few of the more things that we'd like to talk about.

273
00:23:33,522 --> 00:23:35,023
[SPEAKER_06]: So I already mentioned 5G there.

274
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Just below that is microwave radiation.

275
00:23:39,006 --> 00:23:43,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And slightly below that is 4G, what everyone's cell phones are operating on now.

276
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,871
[SPEAKER_06]: And below that is radio.

277
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, all of this stuff in green doesn't do nothing.

278
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:51,757
[SPEAKER_06]: As we've already mentioned, what it does do is it can heat materials.

279
00:23:52,765 --> 00:24:00,547
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, the heating that's caused by this non-ionizing radiation is the only verified biological effect that this stuff has.

280
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:03,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So next slide, please.

281
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:16,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, because this non-ionizing radiation does cause heating, and heating can have an effect on humans, it's regulated by the FCC.

282
00:24:17,093 --> 00:24:18,973
[SPEAKER_06]: These regulations are very strict.

283
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:20,053
[SPEAKER_06]: They're reviewed regularly.

284
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:21,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll mention that in a second.

285
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:29,882
[SPEAKER_06]: They are typically set at about 150th of the level of anything that causes something detectable in experiments out there.

286
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:37,549
[SPEAKER_06]: So a typical experiment on mice may find that at a certain level they sleep more or they eat less or something like that.

287
00:24:37,949 --> 00:24:41,433
[SPEAKER_06]: The FCC will look at that and then set the level 50 times below that.

288
00:24:42,543 --> 00:24:44,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to stress that these levels are very strict.

289
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:51,885
[SPEAKER_06]: My heating pad, shown in red there, I used this last time I gave this talk, but this time I didn't, I didn't need one.

290
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:59,846
[SPEAKER_06]: It violates FCC regulations by about a factor of 50, if the FCC were to choose to regulate heating pads, which they don't.

291
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:03,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Another example would be a laser pointer.

292
00:25:03,847 --> 00:25:08,988
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have one around here somewhere, but if I shine a laser pointer on my skin, I can't feel anything.

293
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:11,474
[SPEAKER_06]: That laser pointer actually violates.

294
00:25:11,514 --> 00:25:18,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just above what the FCC would permit if the FCC chose to regulate laser pointers for heating.

295
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,362
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually do regulate them because they're visible light and they can hurt your eye.

296
00:25:22,682 --> 00:25:25,044
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not talking about damage to your eye.

297
00:25:25,064 --> 00:25:25,965
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about heating.

298
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:27,886
[SPEAKER_06]: So the next slide, please.

299
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:36,871
[SPEAKER_06]: The FCC regularly updates its regulations, as opposed to some myths that are floating around out there.

300
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:42,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Interwebs, they regularly review literature.

301
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:47,380
[SPEAKER_06]: The agencies who they use to advise them also regularly review the literature.

302
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,743
[SPEAKER_06]: So this could be the IEEE or the FDA, etc.

303
00:25:52,537 --> 00:26:02,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to set numbers here, typical 5G small cells, the ones that Sean were talking about, operate at about 250 times below the FCC limits.

304
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:07,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, the FCC limits are so strict that you don't feel them even with a laser pointer on your skin.

305
00:26:08,323 --> 00:26:13,625
[SPEAKER_06]: This is 250 times below that limit at reasonable operating distances.

306
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:16,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me be more specific, that's at about 20 feet from one of these.

307
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:20,988
[SPEAKER_06]: As Sean mentioned, all of these are 30 feet or more above ground level.

308
00:26:22,085 --> 00:26:22,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide.

309
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:26,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was it for me, so I turn it back to Tim.

310
00:26:36,891 --> 00:26:37,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Eric.

311
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:43,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think at this point, we will launch into the discussion of the sites.

312
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:52,190
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys all set with the presentation?

313
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:54,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

314
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

315
00:26:55,851 --> 00:26:56,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

316
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:57,911
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

317
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:59,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're going to move on to the next item on the agenda.

318
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,173
[SPEAKER_05]: General non-site specific public comments.

319
00:27:03,073 --> 00:27:04,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we're going to open the floor.

320
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:13,236
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to open the floor to a general, so not related to a specific site, but you know, Jeff, if you have questions on the presentation, for example, um,

321
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Please direct your questions to me and please hold said specific comments as the location comes up on the agenda.

322
00:27:23,344 --> 00:27:29,327
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm now gonna call on voices who are generally in favor of the applications who would like to speak.

323
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:32,529
[SPEAKER_05]: So please raise your hand if you're in favor of the applications.

324
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:33,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

325
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,892
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, it looks like we have at least one hand up.

326
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:40,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

327
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:47,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Not any currently?

328
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:49,024
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we'll just wait a quick sec here.

329
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:57,005
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, still none?

330
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:58,046
No.

331
00:27:58,766 --> 00:28:04,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, now we'll move on to folks who are in opposition, general opposition, who would like to make a comment.

332
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:05,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Please raise your hand.

333
00:28:08,828 --> 00:28:13,349
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm seeing one hand from Betty L. Okay, hello Betty L.

334
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:17,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

335
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:18,349
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask you to unmute.

336
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:22,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

337
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for having this meeting.

338
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:29,294
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have family who are residents in Medford.

339
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:44,182
[SPEAKER_08]: And my concerns with this, it was a pretty well-rounded presentation by the folks from Verizon about concerns around 5G small cell units being installed in residential areas in and around Medford.

340
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:58,796
[SPEAKER_08]: But to the chairman's point at the beginning of the presentation, the city is not allowed to object to the installation of these sites based on health concerns, whether voiced by the public or voiced by city officials themselves.

341
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:08,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last piece of the Verizon presentation had to do with health concerns and how these are often updated.

342
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:14,728
[SPEAKER_08]: But regardless of the FCC's health standards, I think the issue here is that

343
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:25,610
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we supposed to trust that this is going to be more beneficial to us than harmful?

344
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:33,376
[SPEAKER_08]: There are concerns about radiation from these devices, from radio frequency emissions.

345
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:59,957
[SPEAKER_08]: but if we are not even able to object based on health and safety concerns because the FCC has overruled municipalities and kept them from being able to issue moratoriums against these small cell units, then it's almost like, what's the point of having these meetings, especially since, you know,

346
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:19,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Verizon claims that homeowners are overwhelmingly looking to buy properties that have good cell service and good Wi-Fi service, good telecommunications access, but then they're not allowing us to go through the cities.

347
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:25,409
[SPEAKER_08]: We are having to go through elected officials at the state and federal levels to object to make

348
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,002
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of broader scale objections to the small cell units being installed in residential areas.

349
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:44,127
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess my main point is, you know, how are we supposed to trust this whole process when your hands as city officials are already being tied at the federal level by the FCC?

350
00:30:44,848 --> 00:30:45,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

351
00:30:49,146 --> 00:31:06,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Betty l, I can address one of your questions it sounds like there was two questions in there, one for Verizon, at least one Verizon and one for us and the question that I pulled out that is for the committee is, what's the point of the committee, having this hearing if we don't have any control.

352
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:09,916
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a small amount of control as a city so we can condition these.

353
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:22,123
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see once we get into the site specifics, the sites that where we typically set a list of conditions on Verizon for the installation.

354
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:26,706
[SPEAKER_05]: So that in and of itself is worthy of having these hearings.

355
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:29,168
[SPEAKER_05]: It's and you know sometimes.

356
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:42,406
[SPEAKER_05]: example, if there are city-owned assets on a pole that may be impacted by the installation of their equipment on the pole, then we negotiate right here about what Verizon is going to do.

357
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:48,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Say there's a conflict with a sign, so what are we going to do about that sign?

358
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,532
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the condition going to be, and where are we going to put it, and how are we going to take care of that?

359
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:54,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Another previous example was that there was a

360
00:31:55,724 --> 00:32:01,629
[SPEAKER_05]: pole that potentially was going to be in the way of a turning movement for a vehicle or the equipment that was going to be on it.

361
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:05,933
[SPEAKER_05]: The original equipment size, which was about the size of a mini fridge, now it's much smaller.

362
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:11,839
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a potential for that equipment to get in the way of sight lines and passing clearances for vehicles.

363
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:16,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was conditioned at the time and the equipment got much smaller and it ended up not being concerned.

364
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:19,124
[SPEAKER_05]: However, those are examples of where we do have control.

365
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:29,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Another example would be, you know, one of the polls that was proposed, Verizon made the claim that it was ADA accessible, the clearances were met.

366
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:33,554
[SPEAKER_05]: And we found something different.

367
00:32:33,614 --> 00:32:35,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So we presented our information.

368
00:32:35,837 --> 00:32:38,760
[SPEAKER_05]: We said, well, actually, it's not ADA accessible from our understanding of the code.

369
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:49,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So changes were made to the proposal to remedy that, whether the poll was removed from the proposal or if we conditioned it to remedy the situation.

370
00:32:49,752 --> 00:32:51,494
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is the point here.

371
00:32:52,856 --> 00:33:10,070
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another aspect of the point is that the FCC declaratory ruling, the law, the federal law says that we have to have some process in place, whether it's a policy like we have here, or some sort of ordinance, you know, that the city adopts, which we don't have.

372
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:13,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that provides some explanation.

373
00:33:13,753 --> 00:33:18,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think the, the question for Verizon, along the same lines and Betty Lou.

374
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:20,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Betty L sorry.

375
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:25,581
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could just make sure that I have this question correct it sounds like you're asking Verizon.

376
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:36,071
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe clarification on like value of property and sort of how they're determining what the demand is in Medford.

377
00:33:36,191 --> 00:33:37,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have that correct?

378
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:39,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll take you off.

379
00:33:40,176 --> 00:33:44,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the more important point is how do we trust this process given that this is

380
00:33:46,535 --> 00:34:00,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, to your point at the beginning of this meeting, the FCC has ruled that you can't issue moratoria against small cell units and you can't stop the implementation of these units on health-based grounds.

381
00:34:01,308 --> 00:34:08,354
[SPEAKER_08]: And so given all that and Verizon's attempt just now to kind of assuage our concerns about

382
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:15,669
[SPEAKER_08]: health and biological level effects of radiofrequency emissions.

383
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:31,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Given that the city's hands are tied and we would have to appeal to our senators, our representatives, our state level legislators, given that we are not able to object at the municipal level, how do we trust this process?

384
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:38,287
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a question so I'm gonna let rise and I answer that but from our end that we this committee is part of that process.

385
00:34:39,087 --> 00:34:47,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can trust that we are following the policy that that is in place and we're looking at the things that we can look at commission the things that we can't condition so hopefully have some trust there.

386
00:34:47,613 --> 00:34:54,577
[SPEAKER_05]: But I I share your concerns, you know the federal law coming down like this in time in his hands isn't isn't that.

387
00:34:55,297 --> 00:34:58,738
[SPEAKER_05]: the most transparent way to do things and the most trusting pathway.

388
00:34:58,778 --> 00:35:02,540
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will ask Verizon to see if they can address that question.

389
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:07,221
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's probably tricky to address because trust is within the individual.

390
00:35:07,301 --> 00:35:10,442
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I think there's some things that they can address there.

391
00:35:10,462 --> 00:35:11,043
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Betty.

392
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:15,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.

393
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:16,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Mr. Chairman.

394
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:18,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, Tim Twardowski from Robinson and Cole.

395
00:35:18,465 --> 00:35:23,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're directly on point in terms of trust is up to the individual.

396
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:42,757
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what I can say in response is that much like this board is subject to its own standards and procedural requirements, Verizon is subject to federal regulations as well as the local regulations in terms of the small cell policy that are before us this evening.

397
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:51,662
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our argument this evening obviously is that we, in terms of the applications before you, all of these sites and the

398
00:35:52,970 --> 00:36:02,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Small cells that are proposed this evening are in full compliance with all federal regulations as well as with the with the local small cell policy.

399
00:36:03,372 --> 00:36:06,212
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the process, you know, can, can you trust the process.

400
00:36:06,912 --> 00:36:15,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the mere fact that we're all here this evening that this committee has been formed and been holding public hearings on all of these applications over the course of the past several months.

401
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:21,475
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, speaks to the process itself and not only the efficiency, but the

402
00:36:22,225 --> 00:36:29,871
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of time and effort that the committee members have put into reviewing and commenting and ultimately hopefully approving all of these applications.

403
00:36:30,171 --> 00:36:30,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

404
00:36:32,272 --> 00:36:32,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Mister just the.

405
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:41,279
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and then the next item on the agenda, reading any, well, it's the same agenda item, sorry.

406
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:48,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Anna, we have emails that we would like to summarize and get into the record.

407
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:55,301
[SPEAKER_05]: I think ones that are similar, we could batch them together, but would you mind summarizing some of that input in those comments?

408
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:57,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, yes.

409
00:36:57,142 --> 00:37:03,403
[SPEAKER_03]: So as of six o'clock p.m., there were 12 comments that had been sent to the city's 5G comments inbox.

410
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:10,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Five of those comments asked clarifying questions about the meeting and the application process, and they were answered via email.

411
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:27,299
[SPEAKER_03]: And four comments voiced general opposition to any 5G equipment proposals in Medford, and those were from Kevin Medeiros, 3 Horn Ave., Melanie Tringali, 116 Forest Street, Leonard Hanley, Street Unknown, and Betty Lowe, Street Unknown.

412
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:31,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Anna.

413
00:37:31,785 --> 00:37:32,646
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate that.

414
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,847
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are put into the record.

415
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:42,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're going to move into the next item, which are the application and locations.

416
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:54,363
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to, if we can get the map up for the first one, which is Franklin Street.

417
00:37:55,204 --> 00:37:59,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And while, well, thank you Anna.

418
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:00,985
[SPEAKER_05]: between you and Alicia.

419
00:38:01,065 --> 00:38:01,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, all right.

420
00:38:01,745 --> 00:38:04,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So as long as one of you guys is doing that, I'll go on and read the rest of these.

421
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:12,973
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take discussions and questions from the committee on each location, and then we'll open up public participation, two-minute limit for each one.

422
00:38:14,014 --> 00:38:21,719
[SPEAKER_05]: And please indicate your name and address for the record if you're going to speak, and then we'll have further discussion before a motion.

423
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:31,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first location is Franklin Street, and it is pole 1455.

424
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:39,865
[SPEAKER_05]: While Alicia is pulling up the location, I'll read off my review results.

425
00:38:41,804 --> 00:38:45,249
[SPEAKER_05]: So just so folks understand how I review these.

426
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:54,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I went through each application to make sure that the information required is submitted and things like their insurance certificate is up to date.

427
00:38:55,644 --> 00:38:57,908
[SPEAKER_05]: The special calculations are in there and certified.

428
00:38:58,248 --> 00:39:00,149
[SPEAKER_05]: things like that, going down the list.

429
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:09,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And then basically what I do is confirm some of the measurements and take a look in the field at ones that need to be confirmed.

430
00:39:10,235 --> 00:39:17,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So Franklin Street, this particular poll, the measurement that gets brought up a lot is the base to the top.

431
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:20,581
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just pulled that information out for all the locations.

432
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:21,862
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the first number I'll read.

433
00:39:22,723 --> 00:39:27,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I go over what assets are located on the poll, city-owned assets.

434
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:31,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for example, this one, you can see there's a do not enter sign on this one.

435
00:39:32,259 --> 00:39:33,400
[SPEAKER_05]: and some other signs on the other side.

436
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, and then basically does the base of the pole look good?

437
00:39:38,103 --> 00:39:39,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the ADA clearance okay?

438
00:39:40,605 --> 00:39:46,629
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another discussion item that we've had at past meetings is the proximity to dwellings and parks and things like that.

439
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:56,076
[SPEAKER_05]: So I also take those measurements and Verizon was kind enough in this application and actually the last one as well to include that information in their application.

440
00:39:56,116 --> 00:39:56,796
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was really,

441
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for doing that, you guys.

442
00:40:00,794 --> 00:40:04,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, that was a confirmatory process or a verification process.

443
00:40:04,357 --> 00:40:06,719
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll do this one first.

444
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:09,522
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the Franklin Street poll, poll number 1455.

445
00:40:11,564 --> 00:40:15,107
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's application number 34 in Verizon's reference.

446
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:27,746
[SPEAKER_05]: The pole, the top of the pole above sidewalk level is 39 and a half feet, there are three signs on this pole, according to the graphics, the two of them are in conflict, one of them is just a small placard.

447
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:32,272
[SPEAKER_05]: One is a do not enter and one is a permit sign with a small placard add on.

448
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:47,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And the equipment is shown at that sign height so I'm going to suggest that we take the permit parking sign and place it on a pole actually because I don't think it's even if the equipment was to be placed above the signage.

449
00:40:49,056 --> 00:40:56,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still very cluttered in there and we want drivers to be able to see the signs clearly so this is one that I'm going to suggest we pull the permit parking signs off and we have

450
00:40:58,303 --> 00:41:03,645
[SPEAKER_05]: have a condition to put them on a pole and get them out of the way, because that's where some of the equipment wants to go.

451
00:41:05,305 --> 00:41:11,968
[SPEAKER_05]: The base of the pole, as you can see in this picture, is a concrete base with an expansion joint.

452
00:41:12,508 --> 00:41:13,828
[SPEAKER_05]: That is no longer currently there.

453
00:41:14,048 --> 00:41:15,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I confirmed that in the field.

454
00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:19,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And without that being there, it actually doesn't meet the 36-inch clearance.

455
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:27,193
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm also going to suggest that a condition be that that concrete be replaced and that concrete be replaced according to ADA.

456
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:28,674
[SPEAKER_05]: requirements and standards.

457
00:41:29,414 --> 00:41:37,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now, just so Verizon knows, without that little patch of concrete there, you only have 26 inches of clearance for a sidewalk, okay?

458
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:44,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And the closest dwelling is 38 feet, and it's an attic third story for the height of the building.

459
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is

460
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:59,602
[SPEAKER_05]: My results for the Franklin Street poll, and I have the list of our standard conditions from last time listed here, and I can read them now, or I can read them later.

461
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the committee want me to read them now?

462
00:42:03,165 --> 00:42:05,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd prefer to be reminded of them now.

463
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,600
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do them now.

464
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:18,004
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so number one, prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the applicant shall provide to the city engineer updated insurance certificates as required by paragraph two I of the policy.

465
00:42:18,424 --> 00:42:30,508
[SPEAKER_05]: I left this in here, I'm gonna suggest we leave it in there just because insurance certificates always expire and I'm always, in general, I'm always chasing down updated insurance certificates.

466
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:34,650
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a catch all to encase the,

467
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:39,312
[SPEAKER_05]: By the time they get around to installing it, the certificate has expired.

468
00:42:41,174 --> 00:42:43,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just need an up-to-date, make sure that our certificate's up-to-date.

469
00:42:43,775 --> 00:42:54,822
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, the applicant shall pay for the costs of preparation or make ready work related to moving or relocating any city-owned streetlights or other infrastructure related to the installation of any small cell or related equipment.

470
00:42:55,915 --> 00:43:01,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three, installation of any small cell or related equipment on double poles is strictly prohibited.

471
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:13,693
[SPEAKER_05]: If a new or replacement pole is installed in the future to accommodate that equipment, the applicant will remove or cause the removal of the old pole prior to installing any small cell or related equipment on the new replacement pole.

472
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:37,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four, prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment on the pole, the applicant shall document and submit to the city engineer field measurements that demonstrate the horizontal and vertical clearances of any small cell or related equipment and of existing pole or replacement poles, if any, are in compliance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and applicable Massachusetts regulations.

473
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:42,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So they did actually submit a tally

474
00:43:43,863 --> 00:43:45,865
[SPEAKER_05]: that we asked for this one.

475
00:43:46,025 --> 00:43:49,247
[SPEAKER_05]: So we may be able to strike this one.

476
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:53,911
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep that in mind.

477
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:54,971
[SPEAKER_05]: We can go back to it.

478
00:43:55,512 --> 00:44:03,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Number five, the new small cell related equipment shall not create any noise detectable to the human ear at the pole location on the ground and at the nearest residence.

479
00:44:04,192 --> 00:44:11,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Number six prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the ground surface at the base of the pole must be in or restored to good condition.

480
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:15,174
[SPEAKER_05]: This includes plate repairing concrete sidewalk to city standards.

481
00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:19,432
[SPEAKER_05]: The applicant shall complete installation of the small, oh, sorry, number seven.

482
00:44:19,832 --> 00:44:35,879
[SPEAKER_05]: The applicant shall complete installation of the small cell and related equipment within one year of the date hereof, failing which this approval shall expire and a new application and approval will be necessary before any small cell or related equipment may be installed on the pole or used at this location.

483
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:41,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Upon request of the applicant, the committee may approve one extension of that time period not to exceed six months.

484
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:42,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Number eight.

485
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:55,165
[SPEAKER_05]: a minimum of 30 days prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment on the pole, the applicant shall provide written notice of the intended installation to abutters within 100 feet of the intended installation.

486
00:44:55,625 --> 00:45:09,132
[SPEAKER_05]: The notice shall include information about the work to be done, the type of equipment to be installed, and a description of the applicable standards that the equipment complies with, and contact information to reach the applicant in the event there is a problem or an issue with the functioning of the equipment.

487
00:45:10,093 --> 00:45:10,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Number nine,

488
00:45:10,935 --> 00:45:18,558
[SPEAKER_05]: The applicant shall comply with the policy and any additional applicable state, local and federal requirements, including, but not limited to obtaining an electrical permit.

489
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:32,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Number 10, a minimum of 30 days prior to installation of any small cell or related equipment, the applicant shall provide to the city engineer a schedule indicating the anticipated dates of installation start and finish.

490
00:45:39,772 --> 00:45:50,900
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only one, sorry, I was gonna say the only one is number four about the, we ask for a measurement, field measurements for horizontal and vertical clearances for the small cell related equipment.

491
00:45:51,180 --> 00:46:05,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm inclined to leave this one here just because I found a couple of errors in their work and field measurements I think are good to do at the time of installation to confirm that everything is in place ADA wise.

492
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:09,093
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, discussions and questions from the committee.

493
00:46:10,308 --> 00:46:12,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Tim, this is Robin from KP Lab.

494
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:24,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Before you jump to the committee, can I just confirm you don't need a couple of the conditions that were in the original 42 that I think may have already been addressed, but I just wanted to confirm you don't need them?

495
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,881
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you, Robin.

496
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:35,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, on the last hearing, we did strike a couple because the reason didn't exist anymore.

497
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:38,731
[SPEAKER_05]: They provided updated documents, things like that.

498
00:46:40,258 --> 00:46:52,447
[SPEAKER_13]: So just to confirm for this one, you already have the certification by a registered professional engineer consistent with paragraph two of the policy?

499
00:46:53,028 --> 00:46:53,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

500
00:46:53,748 --> 00:46:53,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

501
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:59,352
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you had, you need to redo frequency affidavits.

502
00:46:59,372 --> 00:47:00,633
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you now have those for this?

503
00:47:01,314 --> 00:47:01,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

504
00:47:01,814 --> 00:47:07,178
[SPEAKER_13]: And the last one was, and I'm not sure if this,

505
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,821
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop me if you already have this one.

506
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:18,487
[SPEAKER_13]: We had prior to installation, the applicant must provide a signed affidavit certifying it on the team equipment in good repair according to SEC standards.

507
00:47:19,428 --> 00:47:31,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Remove any equipment that is no longer in good repair or not in use within 30 days of being no longer in good repair or not in use and will in fact keep the equipment in good repair according to SEC standards.

508
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:34,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct, yeah, we received that statement as well.

509
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:41,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, just double checking to make sure we didn't accidentally drop something.

510
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:41,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

511
00:47:41,922 --> 00:47:42,462
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

512
00:47:42,502 --> 00:47:43,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

513
00:47:43,442 --> 00:47:44,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for double checking.

514
00:47:44,563 --> 00:47:46,243
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to make sure we don't forget anything.

515
00:47:46,683 --> 00:47:50,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that squares away.

516
00:47:50,684 --> 00:47:56,466
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can go right into discussion now from the committee, and then when that's finished, we'll do public participation.

517
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:05,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Any questions or discussions from the committee on this one.

518
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:09,508
[SPEAKER_12]: So Tim did you say that this can be brought into compliance with 88.

519
00:48:09,588 --> 00:48:15,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, you see that little teeny tiny square of concrete at the very bottom of the ball.

520
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:26,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now that does not exist so it looks like the poll was probably replaced and then they just didn't replace that little panel without that panel.

521
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:32,423
[SPEAKER_05]: that measurement from the corner of that little panel to the grass is only about 26 inches.

522
00:48:33,623 --> 00:48:39,227
[SPEAKER_05]: But from the pole all the way to the grass is more than 36 inches, so that would meet it.

523
00:48:39,607 --> 00:48:41,128
[SPEAKER_05]: So without the concrete there, it doesn't meet it.

524
00:48:41,248 --> 00:48:42,208
[SPEAKER_05]: With the concrete, it does.

525
00:48:42,228 --> 00:48:52,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm recommending a condition that that concrete is put back and is put back in ADA compliance prior to the antenna being put up.

526
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:04,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for measuring that because when we look at it, it does not look possibly wide enough for a wheelchair, but I trust your measurements.

527
00:49:06,816 --> 00:49:08,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it doesn't go by the wheelchair, it just goes by 36 inches.

528
00:49:09,377 --> 00:49:11,498
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I mean, 36 inches.

529
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:14,900
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't look it from here, but I trust your measurements.

530
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:16,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I measured it today.

531
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:23,285
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget what the exact measurement was.

532
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:28,233
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like 42 inches or something like that.

533
00:49:28,373 --> 00:49:29,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway.

534
00:49:32,955 --> 00:49:54,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other requirement that you're proposing condition is that they move the permit parking on both sides sign and put it on a separate pole in that vicinity as location to be specific location to be approved by one of our traffic engineers.

535
00:49:55,752 --> 00:49:58,935
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I would suggest.

536
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:06,542
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe that indicates parking by permit only for that block there, for that stretch.

537
00:50:07,303 --> 00:50:09,846
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's probably another sign for the other side.

538
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:12,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So it probably just needs to go on that block.

539
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:19,575
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, a location marked and coordinated with traffic engineering.

540
00:50:25,512 --> 00:50:35,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the only two signs on this poll that do not enter on the back and this one that we're seeing facing us is no, I believe there's no further signs of any height and that is correct.

541
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:37,142
[SPEAKER_05]: That is correct.

542
00:50:37,182 --> 00:50:37,962
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

543
00:50:38,323 --> 00:50:38,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

544
00:50:43,655 --> 00:50:58,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I make a motion to approve this location with the conditions that actually, let's hold let's hold the open up public comment so if we haven't.

545
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And do we have anybody for this location that would like to speak.

546
00:51:06,469 --> 00:51:11,312
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't see any raised hands and there's nothing in the chat, no emails on this one.

547
00:51:11,752 --> 00:51:15,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so Alicia, you are free to move if you'd like.

548
00:51:17,255 --> 00:51:29,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I make a motion to approve this location with the conditions as cited by Tim, that the concrete is replaced in a way that is ADA compliant.

549
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:42,243
[SPEAKER_09]: and that the parking, resident parking signs are located on a separate pole location to be coordinated with our traffic engineering department.

550
00:51:43,564 --> 00:51:43,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

551
00:51:44,144 --> 00:51:48,845
[SPEAKER_05]: And before, I can hear a second, but I just want to check with Verizon.

552
00:51:48,885 --> 00:51:52,486
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a similar type condition you've seen on some other locations.

553
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:56,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any objections to these proposed conditions?

554
00:52:02,938 --> 00:52:03,958
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any objections.

555
00:52:04,919 --> 00:52:05,679
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

556
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:06,899
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

557
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:07,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I hear a second?

558
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Robin.

559
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:23,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, can I just clarify for folks, and we've done this in the past, that the 10 conditions that you read as the board makes motion to refer to as the standard conditions, and then you may add additional conditions for each item, just so the record's clear.

560
00:52:24,052 --> 00:52:24,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.

561
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:26,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just reiterate that, Robin.

562
00:52:26,195 --> 00:52:31,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 10 conditions that I read, we're going to call those the standard conditions moving forward for tonight.

563
00:52:32,923 --> 00:52:41,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when the decisions are issued, they will just be conditions on the permit and then any other conditions that are added in addition to the standard conditions.

564
00:52:41,653 --> 00:52:43,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can

565
00:52:44,856 --> 00:52:54,524
[SPEAKER_05]: While the committee is making motions, the motions can include standard conditions, plus any other special conditions that are moved.

566
00:52:55,024 --> 00:53:03,811
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, Alicia moved for the conditions that I suggested, which is to put the signs on a post coordinated with

567
00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:13,276
[SPEAKER_05]: traffic, and then making sure that the concrete is placed at the base prior to installation and it meets ADA requirements.

568
00:53:13,636 --> 00:53:16,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Alicia, do I have your motion correct there?

569
00:53:16,637 --> 00:53:17,478
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just waiting for a second.

570
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping I have your motion correct, but yes.

571
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so just waiting for a second.

572
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:27,282
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second that.

573
00:53:28,723 --> 00:53:31,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and we'll do a roll call vote.

574
00:53:34,165 --> 00:53:34,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary Ann?

575
00:53:36,406 --> 00:53:36,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

576
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:38,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia?

577
00:53:39,547 --> 00:53:39,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

578
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:40,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

579
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:42,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

580
00:53:46,008 --> 00:53:48,389
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am also a yes.

581
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:59,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is approved with conditions, the standard conditions, the standard 10 conditions we read, and then the two special conditions as described.

582
00:53:59,712 --> 00:54:01,833
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's move on to the next location.

583
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:06,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one second, some more notes.

584
00:54:10,912 --> 00:54:14,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Next location is 84 South Street, poll number 1227.

585
00:54:15,156 --> 00:54:22,663
[SPEAKER_05]: The poll is actually on Turo, and it is application number 57 in Verizon's reference.

586
00:54:24,314 --> 00:54:31,136
[SPEAKER_05]: This pole is, or the top of the pole, the top of the pole is 39.8 feet above the ground.

587
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:33,197
[SPEAKER_05]: There is one sign on it.

588
00:54:33,257 --> 00:54:35,017
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a slow children's sign.

589
00:54:36,978 --> 00:54:39,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's one city light also on this pole.

590
00:54:40,299 --> 00:54:49,822
[SPEAKER_05]: There appear to be potentially some unused service lines or just a lot of service lines that either are

591
00:54:50,776 --> 00:54:53,378
[SPEAKER_05]: extra or just not tidy, not cleaned up.

592
00:54:53,618 --> 00:54:58,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something to consider here.

593
00:54:58,661 --> 00:55:01,442
[SPEAKER_05]: No visible issues with ADA clearances.

594
00:55:02,443 --> 00:55:06,105
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the measurement to the closest dwelling, it's a three-story dwelling, it's 24 feet.

595
00:55:07,426 --> 00:55:19,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And my suggestion for this one is to upgrade the slow children's sign to the caution children's sign.

596
00:55:21,288 --> 00:55:24,551
[SPEAKER_05]: And that meets current standards.

597
00:55:25,612 --> 00:55:40,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And then seeing if Verizon can work with the pole owner and the other leases to clean up what appears to be some excess wires or just some untidiness of general service wires on the pole.

598
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:46,007
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't see that good from this direction, but if you were to visit the pole,

599
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:52,014
[SPEAKER_05]: and look at it maybe a little bit closer, you'll notice that there's just a lot of stuff hanging off that pole.

600
00:55:52,094 --> 00:55:55,717
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm curious if there's a way to neaten it up a little bit.

601
00:55:57,018 --> 00:55:59,540
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so that's where that stands.

602
00:56:00,882 --> 00:56:10,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any, maybe just to streamline things, we'll just say other, we'll just do public comment first and then we'll go into discussion and motions and such.

603
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,973
[SPEAKER_05]: So any public participation on this one, Anna?

604
00:56:16,554 --> 00:56:17,755
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no public comment.

605
00:56:18,556 --> 00:56:19,357
[SPEAKER_05]: None on this one.

606
00:56:19,437 --> 00:56:22,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, discussion from the committee.

607
00:56:25,843 --> 00:56:32,889
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we have any input on Verizon like to comment on some of those wires on that poll that you did you just mentioned?

608
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can we can have them comment.

609
00:56:35,738 --> 00:56:37,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can comment a little bit too.

610
00:56:37,618 --> 00:56:40,859
[SPEAKER_05]: It's most likely some of them might be Verizon.

611
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:42,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are going to be other providers.

612
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:51,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's most likely a joint joint own poll so that they may have limited capacity to do anything about it.

613
00:56:51,123 --> 00:56:57,345
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would like to float it to see if they can at least get information and maybe help the city.

614
00:56:58,726 --> 00:57:07,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Pursue cleaning, cleaning it up a little bit if if that's all they can do, but I would like to actually hear from rising on that as well sure to.

615
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,838
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you that we will.

616
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:10,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Send.

617
00:57:12,438 --> 00:57:17,501
[SPEAKER_01]: our technicians out to take a look at drop wires that might be ours and take care of those.

618
00:57:17,721 --> 00:57:34,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there are others that are involved, Comcast or whomever, we may, we will forward a request to them, but we can't mandate anything from those carriers, but we can address the stuff that's ours.

619
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:55,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the way I'd like to word this committee, thank you, Sam, is Verizon to review existing service lines and remove anything that doesn't need to be there or is redundant or needs to be tidied up or anything like that.

620
00:57:56,636 --> 00:57:57,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think

621
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:13,888
[SPEAKER_05]: That will take care of Verizon, and then we can say, also make the request, as Stan has said that they will agree to do, to notify any other service providers if there's service lines that need to be addressed by other providers.

622
00:58:14,568 --> 00:58:16,409
[SPEAKER_05]: And we understand that Verizon doesn't have control over those.

623
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:21,392
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that sounds good to the committee, so go ahead.

624
00:58:22,055 --> 00:58:24,797
[SPEAKER_12]: Can the city have control over any of that?

625
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:37,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it may be just the picture again, but even that long wire going across the street looks pretty low, as if a truck going by would knock it out.

626
00:58:37,244 --> 00:58:42,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, does the city have control over these, if it's not Verizon, the other providers?

627
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:46,250
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's impacting our right-of-way, so like that wire could be one.

628
00:58:48,517 --> 00:58:52,959
[SPEAKER_12]: So if not, not, not just for aesthetics, I guess, then obviously whatever.

629
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:53,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

630
00:58:53,820 --> 00:59:02,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Like something like that, that's too low that could impact the right of way or anything that impacts one of our assets, uh, signs or trees, um, things like that.

631
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:12,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, but we can, you know, we can include confirming that wires are meeting vertical clearance that emanate from that pool.

632
00:59:16,892 --> 00:59:17,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

633
00:59:25,751 --> 00:59:32,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Tim over on this, I just wanted to mention that there is now a few comments in the chat.

634
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:37,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're more generally about the meeting, but Barbara.

635
00:59:38,197 --> 00:59:42,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Barbara McGonigal says I'm finding this meeting very discouraging.

636
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:46,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We were notified that we are within 300 feet and we had questions about those issues.

637
00:59:46,561 --> 00:59:48,682
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem to be an issue, but he said it well.

638
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,863
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she responded to her.

639
01:00:04,028 --> 01:00:07,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, so I just read them just so I could understand a little bit better.

640
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we empathize with you.

641
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:15,413
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand that, you know, folks want to discuss issues that we don't have purview over.

642
01:00:16,373 --> 01:00:22,216
[SPEAKER_05]: We have spent a significant amount of time in previous meetings discussing this with Verizon and with residents.

643
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:35,901
[SPEAKER_05]: if there are specific questions about, you know, FCC standards or what Verizon is doing or plans to do, Verizon has addressed those questions at past hearings.

644
01:00:36,882 --> 01:00:41,244
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they can come up and they can be addressed.

645
01:00:41,284 --> 01:00:46,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, we are on the site-specific portion of the agenda, so we are going to move forward.

646
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:50,308
[SPEAKER_05]: So as of now,

647
01:00:52,344 --> 01:01:02,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Waiting for a motion, I'm making the suggestion that we update the slow children sign to current standards with a caution children sign.

648
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:14,500
[SPEAKER_05]: And that we have, we asked Verizon to look at their service line, remove anything redundant or not in use, and generally tidy up their wires and to notify

649
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:22,064
[SPEAKER_05]: the other poll users and service providers to do the same.

650
01:01:26,025 --> 01:01:35,168
[SPEAKER_05]: And also to have Verizon confirm that the wires emanating from this poll meet vertical clearances, since one of them does look rather low.

651
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:42,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm waiting for, first Verizon, do you have any objections to those suggestions?

652
01:01:46,158 --> 01:01:46,878
[SPEAKER_11]: no objections.

653
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:48,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

654
01:01:48,739 --> 01:01:50,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh so now I'm just waiting for a motion.

655
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:57,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll make a motion to approve this.

656
01:01:57,483 --> 01:01:57,943
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

657
01:01:57,963 --> 01:01:59,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to do you have something Alicia?

658
01:02:00,504 --> 01:02:01,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Nope.

659
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:15,591
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll make a motion to approve this location with the standard conditions with also the condition to upgrade the so Children signed to caution Children in all of the conditions that the chairman just mentioned for Verizon to look into

660
01:02:19,183 --> 01:02:20,003
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, do we hear a second?

661
01:02:21,684 --> 01:02:22,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

662
01:02:22,084 --> 01:02:26,726
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, and let me finish my notes here, and then we'll do roll call.

663
01:02:26,746 --> 01:02:34,049
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

664
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:36,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call, Marianne?

665
01:02:40,612 --> 01:02:40,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

666
01:02:42,192 --> 01:02:42,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia?

667
01:02:43,553 --> 01:02:43,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

668
01:02:46,974 --> 01:02:47,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

669
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:48,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

670
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:54,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am also a yes to that motion.

671
01:02:54,944 --> 01:03:01,790
[SPEAKER_05]: So 84 South Street, poll number 1227 is approved with conditions.

672
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:08,116
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, the next one on the agenda is 15 Reardon Road, poll number 2421.

673
01:03:21,277 --> 01:03:24,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, first thing I should note is that Reardon Road is a private way.

674
01:03:27,323 --> 01:03:32,848
[SPEAKER_05]: The pole, the top of the pole is 33.8 feet above the base.

675
01:03:32,968 --> 01:03:36,411
[SPEAKER_05]: There is one, probably a city light, I think.

676
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:37,752
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a city light.

677
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right, Alicia?

678
01:03:40,034 --> 01:03:40,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay.

679
01:03:40,635 --> 01:03:41,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's a city light.

680
01:03:42,269 --> 01:03:46,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and then no visible ADA clearance issues.

681
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:50,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously that would be questioned even if it's within our purview, private way.

682
01:03:50,814 --> 01:03:52,875
[SPEAKER_05]: And then no dwellings in the immediate vicinity.

683
01:03:53,395 --> 01:03:54,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks are familiar with Reardon Road.

684
01:03:55,997 --> 01:03:59,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have residences around it.

685
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just basically surrounded by businesses.

686
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one.

687
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:08,143
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll open it up to any public comment.

688
01:04:08,423 --> 01:04:11,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Anna, do we have anybody who would like to speak on 15 Reardon Road?

689
01:04:19,568 --> 01:04:20,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I missed that.

690
01:04:20,488 --> 01:04:21,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of was garbly.

691
01:04:22,889 --> 01:04:23,289
[SPEAKER_03]: One moment.

692
01:04:23,329 --> 01:04:27,010
[SPEAKER_03]: My computer is... Okay.

693
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing any raised hands.

694
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:29,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

695
01:04:30,691 --> 01:04:37,632
[SPEAKER_05]: I will let me know if one pops up and we will move to discussion and motions.

696
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that pole leaning?

697
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:52,362
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't look plumb.

698
01:04:54,082 --> 01:05:06,005
[SPEAKER_09]: On the proposal, it looks to me like they've replaced that pole with a new pole because the pole that's in our paperwork looks newer than that one.

699
01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:20,848
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like, if you look in the paperwork, it looks straight up and down, the photo that they have of it.

700
01:05:22,509 --> 01:05:24,150
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like a new one, Alicia.

701
01:05:25,952 --> 01:05:29,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Verizon, comment, and if that's been placed.

702
01:05:33,258 --> 01:05:36,220
[SPEAKER_09]: The image on the screen is July 2019.

703
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:44,834
[SPEAKER_09]: the date on the Google photo that we are looking at on the screen.

704
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:50,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would agree with you, Alicia.

705
01:05:50,795 --> 01:05:54,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the photos in the application are newer.

706
01:05:54,776 --> 01:05:56,197
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not what I looked at in the field.

707
01:05:57,437 --> 01:06:01,598
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Sean, if you can, it looks like you guys put in a new poll already, right?

708
01:06:01,618 --> 01:06:02,458
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can confirm that.

709
01:06:13,371 --> 01:06:19,553
[SPEAKER_09]: So given, yeah, the one in the application package, that photo looks much better.

710
01:06:19,573 --> 01:06:22,794
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm inclined to approve this one.

711
01:06:22,814 --> 01:06:25,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any?

712
01:06:34,637 --> 01:06:35,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I am as well.

713
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:41,690
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of polls that aren't.

714
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:45,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve this one with our standard conditions.

715
01:06:46,893 --> 01:06:47,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

716
01:06:48,894 --> 01:06:49,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

717
01:06:51,315 --> 01:06:51,695
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

718
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:55,176
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

719
01:06:55,216 --> 01:06:57,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Do a roll call vote.

720
01:06:58,158 --> 01:06:58,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul.

721
01:06:59,678 --> 01:06:59,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

722
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:02,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia.

723
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:03,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

724
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:04,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Marianne.

725
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:05,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

726
01:07:08,702 --> 01:07:09,523
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am also a yes.

727
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:16,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, 15 Reardon Road is approved with standard conditions.

728
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:23,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, 60 Oakland Street, pole 204.

729
01:07:26,874 --> 01:07:29,595
[SPEAKER_05]: This one, 39 feet above ground level.

730
01:07:30,055 --> 01:07:36,197
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one permit parking sign that can likely remain, and there's one city light on the pole.

731
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:39,378
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a potential private garden at the base.

732
01:07:42,595 --> 01:07:53,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though it's a private property encroaching on public property, I don't want to mess with the residence's garden there at the bottom of the pole.

733
01:07:53,557 --> 01:08:00,019
[SPEAKER_05]: So as long as the pole owner doesn't mind, I would like that to be replaced if needed or if it's disturbed.

734
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,240
[SPEAKER_05]: No reason to get in that residence garden there or destroy their garden for this.

735
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:12,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw no visible ADA clearance issues and 27 feet to the nearest dwelling.

736
01:08:13,565 --> 01:08:17,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So that actually, this is one I did look at in the field to see if that really was a little garden.

737
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:17,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

738
01:08:17,831 --> 01:08:19,893
[SPEAKER_05]: It's someone's little garden that they put around the pole, it looks like.

739
01:08:20,754 --> 01:08:23,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a little better shape actually today than it shows in this picture.

740
01:08:23,758 --> 01:08:25,300
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's this one.

741
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:28,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Open up to public comment.

742
01:08:28,945 --> 01:08:31,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have any public comment on this one?

743
01:08:34,088 --> 01:08:39,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not seeing any hand raises right now, but we do have a couple of email comments on this one.

744
01:08:39,731 --> 01:08:47,715
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first is from Annette Bloom at 10 Oak Bluff Street, who voices strong opposition to 5G within 300 feet of her house.

745
01:08:48,955 --> 01:09:02,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next one is from Barbara McGonigal at 49 Oakland Street, who again, voices strong opposition to 5G in Bedford near residential neighborhoods and playgrounds, specifically in their neighborhood as many children live nearby.

746
01:09:03,808 --> 01:09:04,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you, Anna.

747
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:09,472
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, with that said, discussion and motions.

748
01:09:09,753 --> 01:09:11,194
[SPEAKER_05]: So discussion.

749
01:09:25,264 --> 01:09:28,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, if there's no discussions, I don't have any questions on this one, Mr. Chairman.

750
01:09:28,927 --> 01:09:32,350
[SPEAKER_11]: I make a motion to approve this site with our standing conditions.

751
01:09:34,521 --> 01:09:35,502
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, do we hear a second?

752
01:09:36,743 --> 01:09:48,033
[SPEAKER_09]: And the condition that Verizon make an effort to not damage the pretty garden at the base of the pole.

753
01:09:48,674 --> 01:09:50,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you, Alicia, that's right.

754
01:09:50,876 --> 01:10:01,165
[SPEAKER_05]: So Paul, that's a revised motion, standard conditions, plus take appropriate measures to not disturb the private garden.

755
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:02,999
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, that's correct.

756
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:03,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

757
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:06,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Go upstairs.

758
01:10:06,781 --> 01:10:13,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Go upstairs.

759
01:10:15,587 --> 01:10:17,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, tonight a little blistered.

760
01:10:17,248 --> 01:10:18,969
[SPEAKER_13]: Did Verizon have anything to say on that garden?

761
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:22,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't asked yet.

762
01:10:22,692 --> 01:10:23,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys have anything to say on that garden?

763
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:26,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Robin.

764
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:27,915
[SPEAKER_12]: No problem.

765
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:34,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we responding to the concerns in the chat or is that for the public opinion time?

766
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:38,652
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there is additional concerns in the chat.

767
01:10:39,312 --> 01:10:40,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let me check it out.

768
01:10:40,993 --> 01:10:47,294
[SPEAKER_05]: In the meantime, Brian, do you have any objections to trying to preserve that little garden at the base of that pole there?

769
01:10:51,715 --> 01:10:56,436
[SPEAKER_10]: We should be able to work around that as best we can and keep it as it is.

770
01:10:57,297 --> 01:10:57,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

771
01:10:57,397 --> 01:10:57,997
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

772
01:10:58,057 --> 01:10:58,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Sean.

773
01:10:59,837 --> 01:11:18,956
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, let me... So the concerns in the chat are health concerns, and somebody is quoting the scientific American opinion piece that I strongly object to because there are other scientific American opinion pieces that contradict it completely and explicitly.

774
01:11:20,599 --> 01:11:24,442
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is we cannot take into concern health impacts.

775
01:11:24,783 --> 01:11:27,885
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact that children live nearby is a health concern.

776
01:11:28,986 --> 01:11:34,251
[SPEAKER_09]: If we thought the pole was going to fall on a child, that would be a concern we could take into account.

777
01:11:36,433 --> 01:11:37,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Alicia.

778
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:47,368
[SPEAKER_05]: There are concerns with the other concern that I see here, Alicia.

779
01:11:48,128 --> 01:12:02,752
[SPEAKER_05]: How secure is our personal data with all of these small cells of fixed utility poles throughout the city so I know Verizon has addressed that in previous meetings, but for the sake of some folks here, who obviously didn't go to the meetings before, I will ask Verizon.

780
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:21,049
[SPEAKER_05]: During this part of the agenda, I know we didn't say that that's what we would do, but if you could just speak briefly about the data protection aspect of 5G in small cells and what, if any, impacts this rollout has on data protection.

781
01:12:29,828 --> 01:12:30,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I should jump in here.

782
01:12:31,209 --> 01:12:34,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I've read a bit because it's come up in the past.

783
01:12:35,252 --> 01:12:47,940
[SPEAKER_06]: What the experts were saying was that 5G is just as secure as 4G, but because it's a newer technology, that it should be able to be more secure than current standards.

784
01:12:49,461 --> 01:12:50,922
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume that's what they're going to work towards.

785
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:54,376
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.

786
01:12:54,576 --> 01:12:54,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

787
01:12:54,896 --> 01:12:55,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

788
01:12:55,416 --> 01:13:01,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds similar and consistent with the responses we've heard on that topic before from Verizon.

789
01:13:02,223 --> 01:13:08,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the committee feel like we need more response from Verizon on that particular topic at this time?

790
01:13:12,112 --> 01:13:12,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Hearing none.

791
01:13:12,472 --> 01:13:13,613
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I don't think so.

792
01:13:13,653 --> 01:13:13,753
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

793
01:13:14,494 --> 01:13:14,594
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

794
01:13:14,614 --> 01:13:15,475
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

795
01:13:16,115 --> 01:13:17,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I would agree, yeah.

796
01:13:17,597 --> 01:13:19,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, just to summarize for the resident bringing it up,

797
01:13:21,766 --> 01:13:33,913
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea being is what we've been told is that the data being secured on this network should be better than what it was prior because the technology is getting better.

798
01:13:34,153 --> 01:13:35,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not going the other way.

799
01:13:36,174 --> 01:13:38,776
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

800
01:13:38,816 --> 01:13:40,817
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a motion on the floor and we also have a second.

801
01:13:41,358 --> 01:13:50,503
[SPEAKER_05]: So the motion on the floor is approved with standard conditions and to take measures to protect the garden during installation, the private garden.

802
01:13:51,862 --> 01:13:55,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I, so that was seconded, so we'll take a roll call vote.

803
01:13:56,324 --> 01:13:56,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Marianne?

804
01:13:58,545 --> 01:13:58,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

805
01:14:01,867 --> 01:14:02,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul?

806
01:14:03,528 --> 01:14:03,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

807
01:14:05,268 --> 01:14:05,649
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia?

808
01:14:05,669 --> 01:14:06,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

809
01:14:07,549 --> 01:14:08,090
[SPEAKER_05]: And me, yes.

810
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:18,915
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so 60 Oakland Street is approved with standard conditions plus one special condition.

811
01:14:20,433 --> 01:14:21,954
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, next is 84 Paris Street.

812
01:14:26,835 --> 01:14:35,278
[SPEAKER_05]: For this one, my measurements, 10 meters to the decimal point there, Marianne, to the top of the pole, 32.8 feet.

813
01:14:35,858 --> 01:14:38,619
[SPEAKER_05]: So no city assets on this pole.

814
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:43,501
[SPEAKER_05]: The base needs concrete.

815
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:46,002
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the city's newer, newly built roads.

816
01:14:48,922 --> 01:14:57,528
[SPEAKER_05]: just saying that as an FYI so folks know, no visible ADA clearances that I can see on this one, 22 feet to the closest dwelling, which is a three-story dwelling.

817
01:14:58,028 --> 01:15:02,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that said, do we have any public comments on this one?

818
01:15:02,391 --> 01:15:11,377
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not seeing any raised hands, or were there any emails?

819
01:15:12,417 --> 01:15:15,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so open for discussion by the committee.

820
01:15:21,201 --> 01:15:22,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Tim, what did you say the height was on that?

821
01:15:22,802 --> 01:15:24,623
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, could you repeat the height, please?

822
01:15:24,803 --> 01:15:25,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, 32.8 feet.

823
01:15:25,903 --> 01:15:32,787
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's to the existing top of the pole, correct, I believe?

824
01:15:32,807 --> 01:15:38,189
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's from the sidewalk surface to the top of the pole.

825
01:15:38,669 --> 01:15:39,470
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thanks.

826
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:44,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is, just so folks can understand, that is 10 meters, exactly.

827
01:15:51,762 --> 01:15:55,284
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I don't have any discussions on this one.

828
01:15:57,044 --> 01:15:59,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So the floor is open for a motion.

829
01:16:01,887 --> 01:16:04,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve with our standard conditions.

830
01:16:05,788 --> 01:16:06,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a second?

831
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:09,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

832
01:16:15,773 --> 01:16:16,933
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call Marianne.

833
01:16:18,294 --> 01:16:18,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

834
01:16:20,495 --> 01:16:20,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia?

835
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:21,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

836
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:23,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul?

837
01:16:24,521 --> 01:16:24,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

838
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:28,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am also a yes.

839
01:16:30,102 --> 01:16:32,983
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, 84 Paris Street is approved with us in the conditions.

840
01:16:34,043 --> 01:16:40,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Next is 167 Grant Avenue, pole number 1876, application number 70.

841
01:16:43,126 --> 01:16:45,987
[SPEAKER_05]: This one, 34 feet to the top of the pole.

842
01:16:46,007 --> 01:16:48,127
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one city light on this pole.

843
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:58,161
[SPEAKER_05]: The base was fine, no visible ADA clearances.

844
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:05,483
[SPEAKER_05]: This one is relatively close compared to other ones to a resident, eight feet.

845
01:17:06,784 --> 01:17:12,026
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it's a two-story resident and the antenna actually sits above the roof level.

846
01:17:12,226 --> 01:17:15,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see from this picture in the application too, it's quite a ways up there.

847
01:17:16,828 --> 01:17:21,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but the measurement from the pole to the building is eight feet.

848
01:17:24,912 --> 01:17:30,934
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is another one where I thought that the, well, no, actually, no, this isn't that one, sorry.

849
01:17:31,414 --> 01:17:32,975
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different one.

850
01:17:33,035 --> 01:17:39,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so that was my takeaway for this particular poll.

851
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:43,159
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we have any public comment for 167 Grand Avenue, poll 1876?

852
01:17:43,799 --> 01:17:49,201
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no public comment.

853
01:17:50,181 --> 01:17:51,782
[SPEAKER_05]: No public comment, okay.

854
01:17:51,882 --> 01:17:53,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Discussion questions from the committee.

855
01:18:07,863 --> 01:18:11,566
[SPEAKER_05]: If no discussion, just waiting a motion.

856
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,947
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have any suggestions for this one.

857
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:20,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval with our standard conditions.

858
01:18:23,413 --> 01:18:23,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

859
01:18:23,593 --> 01:18:24,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I hear a second?

860
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:29,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

861
01:18:31,632 --> 01:18:32,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Paul.

862
01:18:34,173 --> 01:18:35,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, Mary Ann?

863
01:18:37,795 --> 01:18:38,015
Yes.

864
01:18:40,356 --> 01:18:40,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia?

865
01:18:41,697 --> 01:18:41,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

866
01:18:44,478 --> 01:18:44,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul?

867
01:18:45,919 --> 01:18:46,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

868
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am a yes as well.

869
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:56,003
[SPEAKER_05]: 167 Grant Avenue is approved with standard conditions.

870
01:18:56,323 --> 01:18:57,444
[SPEAKER_05]: 33 Grant Avenue is next.

871
01:19:00,976 --> 01:19:06,498
[SPEAKER_05]: On 33 Grant Avenue, the measurement is 37.8 to the top of the pole.

872
01:19:07,218 --> 01:19:08,678
[SPEAKER_05]: No city assets on this pole.

873
01:19:09,799 --> 01:19:12,220
[SPEAKER_05]: The base is okay, it's just a grass strip.

874
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:19,182
[SPEAKER_05]: No visible ADA clearance issues and 15 feet to the closest dwelling, which is a three-story dwelling.

875
01:19:22,263 --> 01:19:25,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So any public comment on this one, Anna?

876
01:19:29,085 --> 01:19:30,405
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no public comment.

877
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:32,192
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

878
01:19:33,534 --> 01:19:38,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Discussion, questions, et cetera.

879
01:19:38,998 --> 01:19:40,960
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, I'll wait a motion.

880
01:19:43,742 --> 01:19:46,845
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll make a motion to approve this site with standard conditions.

881
01:19:49,828 --> 01:19:50,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

882
01:19:55,653 --> 01:19:56,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Marianne.

883
01:19:56,273 --> 01:19:56,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Bob.

884
01:19:57,614 --> 01:19:58,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Do a roll call vote.

885
01:20:01,687 --> 01:20:01,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

886
01:20:04,147 --> 01:20:04,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul.

887
01:20:05,568 --> 01:20:05,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

888
01:20:07,408 --> 01:20:07,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary Ann.

889
01:20:08,468 --> 01:20:08,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

890
01:20:10,809 --> 01:20:11,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a yes as well.

891
01:20:15,129 --> 01:20:17,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So 33 Grant Avenue is approved with standard conditions.

892
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:21,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Next one is 103 Otis Street, 103 Otis Street.

893
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:23,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Poll number 1333, application number 74, Verizon's reference.

894
01:20:33,287 --> 01:20:36,610
[SPEAKER_05]: This one, 39.4 feet to the top of the pole.

895
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:38,451
[SPEAKER_05]: One city light is on here.

896
01:20:38,471 --> 01:20:44,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the base is a grass strip, again, on this one, and it looks okay.

897
01:20:45,817 --> 01:20:47,438
[SPEAKER_05]: No visible ADA clearance issues.

898
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:50,460
[SPEAKER_05]: 34 feet to the closest building.

899
01:20:52,102 --> 01:20:56,445
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is an interesting one, because it's got a brick sidewalk, not a lot of brick sidewalks out there.

900
01:20:56,525 --> 01:20:57,086
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.

901
01:20:57,826 --> 01:20:58,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

902
01:21:01,154 --> 01:21:04,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that play into the ADA or anything like that?

903
01:21:04,658 --> 01:21:09,344
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I assume the city is not about to change the sidewalk?

904
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we wouldn't change the sidewalk.

905
01:21:14,229 --> 01:21:16,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see any reason to field visit this one.

906
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes bricks do come loose and things like that.

907
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:23,334
[SPEAKER_05]: But the pole is not in the sidewalk.

908
01:21:23,354 --> 01:21:24,915
[SPEAKER_05]: The pole is in the grass strip.

909
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:27,436
[SPEAKER_05]: And the clearance issues aren't there.

910
01:21:27,536 --> 01:21:29,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So, well, you know, there's plenty of clearance.

911
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:37,182
[SPEAKER_05]: As any work by others in the city, if they were to damage something, they would have to fix it.

912
01:21:38,202 --> 01:21:42,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So if that sidewalk is damaged while they're doing work on that pole, it would be their responsibility to fix it.

913
01:21:44,072 --> 01:21:46,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's pretty settled in place, that particular sidewalk.

914
01:21:54,954 --> 01:21:56,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Any public comment on this one, Anna?

915
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,556
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no public comment.

916
01:22:03,176 --> 01:22:04,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, you cut out, was that a no?

917
01:22:05,196 --> 01:22:06,157
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no public comment.

918
01:22:06,937 --> 01:22:07,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

919
01:22:07,557 --> 01:22:12,158
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, with that said, our usual discussion

920
01:22:13,213 --> 01:22:13,914
[SPEAKER_05]: until motion.

921
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:20,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval with our standard comments.

922
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:23,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Standard conditions.

923
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

924
01:22:28,623 --> 01:22:30,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Has it been a long week for you two already?

925
01:22:30,164 --> 01:22:32,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's sure has been a long one for me already.

926
01:22:35,965 --> 01:22:39,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had a busier two days of my life, actually, I don't think.

927
01:22:39,566 --> 01:22:40,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I second that, Tim.

928
01:22:41,447 --> 01:22:42,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.

929
01:22:43,808 --> 01:22:44,208
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

930
01:22:44,628 --> 01:22:50,591
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we have a motion on the table to approve with standard conditions from Alicia.

931
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:51,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I hear a second?

932
01:22:51,651 --> 01:22:55,292
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second.

933
01:22:56,673 --> 01:22:57,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Paul.

934
01:22:59,314 --> 01:23:00,294
[SPEAKER_05]: And roll call vote.

935
01:23:00,334 --> 01:23:00,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary Ann?

936
01:23:03,095 --> 01:23:03,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

937
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:04,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia?

938
01:23:05,756 --> 01:23:06,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

939
01:23:07,016 --> 01:23:07,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul.

940
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:08,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

941
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:13,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And me, yes.

942
01:23:13,997 --> 01:23:17,718
[SPEAKER_05]: 103 Otis Street is approved with our standard conditions.

943
01:23:19,238 --> 01:23:20,118
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the last one.

944
01:23:20,299 --> 01:23:21,199
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the last one.

945
01:23:21,759 --> 01:23:30,500
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is 15 Daniel Street, poll 2939, application number 76 on the Verizon's reference.

946
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:34,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And the numbers...

947
01:23:38,152 --> 01:23:40,374
[SPEAKER_05]: 38.8 feet to the top of the pole.

948
01:23:40,394 --> 01:23:41,994
[SPEAKER_05]: There's one city light on this one.

949
01:23:43,075 --> 01:23:46,757
[SPEAKER_05]: The base is okay.

950
01:23:48,258 --> 01:23:51,120
[SPEAKER_05]: No visible ADA clearance issues.

951
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:53,761
[SPEAKER_05]: 26 feet to the nearest dwelling.

952
01:23:53,781 --> 01:24:01,026
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a two-story building with attic windows, as you can see in the picture there.

953
01:24:01,106 --> 01:24:04,928
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, any public comment on this one, Anna?

954
01:24:06,173 --> 01:24:16,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there was an email comment submitted from John Hagan on Daniel Street, who states his opposition to federal jail equipment being placed near his property.

955
01:24:18,338 --> 01:24:19,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we acknowledge that.

956
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,760
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the address on that?

957
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I missed the address.

958
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:27,222
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't a specified address just on Daniel Street.

959
01:24:28,005 --> 01:24:29,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, on Daniel Street.

960
01:24:29,326 --> 01:24:33,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So just so the committee is aware, I did look into the right-of-way for this one.

961
01:24:34,489 --> 01:24:38,391
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have noticed that it's up against the highway.

962
01:24:39,111 --> 01:24:46,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So right beyond the pole in this view, there's, well, not right beyond, but a number of feet beyond, there's a fence.

963
01:24:47,156 --> 01:24:51,138
[SPEAKER_05]: That fence most likely lies on the right-of-way line for Interstate 93.

964
01:24:52,902 --> 01:25:02,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So this part of Daniel Street is in the right-of-way system that's in the city's jurisdiction.

965
01:25:03,425 --> 01:25:10,887
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you were to take a right here and kind of follow Daniel Street around, it changes to state jurisdiction.

966
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:17,950
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are currently, with this poll, we are in the city's jurisdiction as far as the land goes.

967
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:22,231
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the right-of-way line itself, from what I can tell,

968
01:25:22,841 --> 01:25:26,442
[SPEAKER_05]: runs, basically, you can see those leaf bags.

969
01:25:26,962 --> 01:25:30,143
[SPEAKER_05]: To the left of the leaf bags, there's a flush curb and some sidewalk.

970
01:25:30,764 --> 01:25:38,466
[SPEAKER_05]: That's basically the boundary line for the right-of-way, as well as, obviously, the frontage parcel line for the building.

971
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:44,788
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's about where that lands to give the committee an understanding of where this pole lives.

972
01:25:45,268 --> 01:25:50,090
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is in our property, and it is right on the edge, basically, on our property.

973
01:25:51,659 --> 01:25:56,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't see any issues with clearance on this one.

974
01:25:57,881 --> 01:25:59,722
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just a strange location.

975
01:25:59,742 --> 01:26:02,862
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, there's a double pole in the picture, but we have that covered with our conditions.

976
01:26:03,123 --> 01:26:07,544
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to resolve the double pole issue before they install the antenna.

977
01:26:08,684 --> 01:26:12,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that said, any public comment on this one, Anna?

978
01:26:14,026 --> 01:26:15,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you already asked that, Tim.

979
01:26:16,367 --> 01:26:17,787
[SPEAKER_03]: There was just one email.

980
01:26:18,727 --> 01:26:18,967
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

981
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:19,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

982
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:20,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I say it's a long week?

983
01:26:20,848 --> 01:26:20,908
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

984
01:26:21,486 --> 01:26:22,787
[SPEAKER_05]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

985
01:26:22,807 --> 01:26:23,247
[SPEAKER_05]: PB, Peter Vitales.

986
01:26:23,267 --> 01:26:24,008
[SPEAKER_05]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

987
01:26:24,428 --> 01:26:30,913
[SPEAKER_05]: PB, Peter Vitales.

988
01:26:38,502 --> 01:26:53,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe from their application that the image, so the image on the screen is from November, 2020, and they actually had an image in their application with the double pole and then newer, what appears to be just the new pole with the double pole gone.

989
01:26:54,147 --> 01:26:56,228
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew we wouldn't approve it with the double pole.

990
01:26:59,149 --> 01:27:00,429
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but it's in there anyhow.

991
01:27:00,449 --> 01:27:03,691
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the work's already been done for the pole.

992
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:10,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for explaining the right-of-way stuff.

993
01:27:11,992 --> 01:27:14,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Move approval with our standard conditions.

994
01:27:14,093 --> 01:27:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

995
01:27:15,974 --> 01:27:16,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Alicia.

996
01:27:16,574 --> 01:27:17,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we hear a second?

997
01:27:20,256 --> 01:27:20,957
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second that.

998
01:27:21,637 --> 01:27:22,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Paul.

999
01:27:24,458 --> 01:27:25,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, Miriam.

1000
01:27:26,259 --> 01:27:26,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1001
01:27:30,302 --> 01:27:30,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia?

1002
01:27:31,442 --> 01:27:31,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1003
01:27:35,905 --> 01:27:37,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You cut out right when you spoke.

1004
01:27:37,565 --> 01:27:37,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

1005
01:27:38,186 --> 01:27:38,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1006
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:39,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1007
01:27:42,629 --> 01:27:42,850
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul?

1008
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:44,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1009
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:46,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also a yes.

1010
01:27:46,111 --> 01:27:57,075
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so 15 Daniel Street poll 2939 is approved with standard conditions.

1011
01:28:00,577 --> 01:28:03,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the next item on the agenda is adjournment.

1012
01:28:05,178 --> 01:28:08,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we do that, just would like to thank everybody

1013
01:28:09,567 --> 01:28:17,191
[SPEAKER_05]: for coming, thanking folks for speaking and making comments.

1014
01:28:18,912 --> 01:28:22,374
[SPEAKER_05]: Betty-El, I do see your hand raised.

1015
01:28:26,516 --> 01:28:34,100
[SPEAKER_05]: We've gone through the agenda, but what I can do is if we'll be brief, I do wanna allow you to speak.

1016
01:28:35,921 --> 01:28:37,202
[SPEAKER_05]: If you will be brief,

1017
01:28:38,902 --> 01:28:41,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I think there are two participants raised hands.

1018
01:28:41,704 --> 01:28:45,966
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you could please keep it brief, that's all that I ask.

1019
01:28:46,006 --> 01:28:53,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I will let those two participants speak since they have their hands raised and we haven't closed down just yet.

1020
01:28:53,711 --> 01:28:57,233
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe do them in order, Betty L first.

1021
01:28:57,253 --> 01:28:57,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1022
01:29:06,302 --> 01:29:16,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to reiterate my points earlier about being able to trust this process and being able to trust that everything under the city's purview is being handled appropriately.

1023
01:29:16,408 --> 01:29:29,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, you do seem to mostly be following the rules that the city has set out, given the constraints placed by the FCC, but then the FCC's processes

1024
01:29:30,293 --> 01:29:34,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also questionable for me in terms of trust, and I think for a lot of people as well.

1025
01:29:35,095 --> 01:29:53,700
[SPEAKER_08]: The rules that were imposed by the FCC back in 2018 and 2019 that limit the ability of cities and towns to regulate small cell wireless infrastructures, that was imposed by former chairman Ajit Pai, who also ruled against net neutrality.

1026
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to raise this point to the public.

1027
01:29:56,681 --> 01:29:58,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Net neutrality is the,

1028
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:28,242
[SPEAKER_08]: is a rule that requires internet service providers to serve all content, regardless of who it's from, at the same rate, at the same speeds, at the same level of reliability, whereas the repeal of net neutrality would have allowed for different content providers to serve content at faster rates than others, depending on whether or not they were politically connected well enough or had paid somebody.

1029
01:30:30,088 --> 01:30:35,369
[SPEAKER_08]: But former Chairman Pai of the FCC was responsible for repealing net neutrality.

1030
01:30:35,509 --> 01:30:47,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was also the one that imposed these rules that are keeping municipalities from being able to issue moratoria against small cell infrastructure and to object on the grounds of health and safety.

1031
01:30:47,772 --> 01:30:57,855
[SPEAKER_08]: So a process coming from an agency led by a chairman that's already proven so unaccountable to millions of Americans

1032
01:30:59,018 --> 01:31:00,459
[SPEAKER_08]: how are we supposed to trust this process?

1033
01:31:00,679 --> 01:31:08,985
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that I just want to voice to the public that's watching this and reading these comments and trying to participate in this process.

1034
01:31:09,025 --> 01:31:09,745
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1035
01:31:11,267 --> 01:31:11,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Betty.

1036
01:31:11,827 --> 01:31:12,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

1037
01:31:13,268 --> 01:31:17,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do hear you, and we've heard a lot of similar statements in previous meetings.

1038
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:20,993
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping that word gets out there.

1039
01:31:21,053 --> 01:31:25,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, like I said at the beginning of the meeting, the best course of action to get

1040
01:31:26,555 --> 01:31:33,718
[SPEAKER_05]: this sort of thing changed from a resident advocacy perspective would be to talk to your state and federal legislation.

1041
01:31:34,338 --> 01:31:37,359
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much, everybody.

1042
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:42,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a movement for adjournment?

1043
01:31:44,642 --> 01:31:46,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that, I just wanted to thank, again, thank you everybody.

1044
01:31:46,823 --> 01:31:47,844
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the middle of thanking folks.

1045
01:31:48,144 --> 01:31:52,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to Verizon and thanks to the public for being here tonight and being patient.

1046
01:31:52,926 --> 01:31:53,746
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you very much.

1047
01:31:54,986 --> 01:31:56,327
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a movement for adjournment.

1048
01:31:59,985 --> 01:32:00,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Tim.

1049
01:32:00,626 --> 01:32:01,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice job tonight.

1050
01:32:01,426 --> 01:32:02,667
[SPEAKER_11]: I make a motion to adjourn.

1051
01:32:02,687 --> 01:32:04,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Paul.

1052
01:32:04,428 --> 01:32:05,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I hear a second?

1053
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:06,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1054
01:32:12,795 --> 01:32:13,976
[SPEAKER_05]: And roll call, Alicia?

1055
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:15,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1056
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:17,718
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul?

1057
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:18,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1058
01:32:21,201 --> 01:32:21,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary Ann?

1059
01:32:22,782 --> 01:32:23,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1060
01:32:24,564 --> 01:32:26,045
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am also a yes.

1061
01:32:27,113 --> 01:32:31,098
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, everybody, have a good night, and I'll see folks tomorrow that I'll see tomorrow.

1062
01:32:31,738 --> 01:32:32,339
[SPEAKER_05]: You too, Tim.

1063
01:32:32,379 --> 01:32:32,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1064
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Good night, everybody.

1065
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:34,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
