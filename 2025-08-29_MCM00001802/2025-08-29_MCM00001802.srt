[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

10
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:31,391
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mary Lee is currently absent, and then Yvette Velez said she won't be making it today.

11
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:34,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So Yvette's absent, Mike Caldera present.

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:38,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have a quorum present, and we can get started.

13
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:43,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, could you please read the first matter?

14
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,735
[SPEAKER_01]: 121 Second Street continued from July 31st, 2025.

15
00:00:50,595 --> 00:01:03,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Applicant and owner Panagiotis Mamounas to replace an existing single-family building with a two-family building in the general residence zoning district allowed use with insufficient plot size, width and coverage and front yard setbacks per the city of Medford zoning ordinance.

16
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:07,143
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

17
00:01:07,263 --> 00:01:07,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dennis.

18
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:11,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we can continue this matter from our last meeting.

19
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:18,997
[SPEAKER_05]: At that meeting, there were four members of the board present, myself, Andre, Chris and Mary.

20
00:01:20,358 --> 00:01:22,020
[SPEAKER_05]: We did hear a little bit of testimony.

21
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,162
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't get particularly far.

22
00:01:24,423 --> 00:01:25,824
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I understand it, the

23
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:30,148
[SPEAKER_05]: proponent is going to be presenting some new plans.

24
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:44,658
[SPEAKER_05]: And so because Jim wasn't here last time, my ask is just please make sure to present the plans in full context so that he has all the information he needs to make a decision and we can retain quorum.

25
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:45,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that sound good?

26
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:46,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,580
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

28
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello and welcome.

29
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:52,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, thank you, Mr. Chair.

30
00:01:52,505 --> 00:01:56,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And through your members, uh, I feel very special that we're the only thing on the docket tonight.

31
00:01:57,387 --> 00:02:06,012
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will try to make this, um, as quick and easy as possible, but also giving context for, for member Durrani as well, since he was not here last time.

32
00:02:06,612 --> 00:02:11,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is it okay if I, uh, get a screen share and show everything?

33
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:15,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please go ahead.

34
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:15,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

35
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:16,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Just making sure.

36
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:22,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm just going to start with the kind of the 10,000 foot view, like literally here.

37
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:27,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just want to, I always like to start with, this is the neighborhood that we're, we're talking about.

38
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:35,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and right here is, is the current lot that we are, uh, we're proposing to put a two family on.

39
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:39,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it is part of a.

40
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:43,689
[SPEAKER_02]: mix of a one family and two family neighborhoods.

41
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:48,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Two families do dominate the neighborhood as well.

42
00:02:51,214 --> 00:03:01,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And also just as its neighbor as well is very similar to our

43
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:08,763
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, plot here, um, eight or less.

44
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:21,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, what we're proposing is to take the current one family that's been on the structure since 1920, um, and change it into a two family kind of consistent with the neighborhood.

45
00:03:21,647 --> 00:03:28,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and here is the new plan, but just also, I want to, this is the current structure.

46
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:30,890
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll always like to say, always like to.

47
00:03:35,999 --> 00:04:01,185
[SPEAKER_02]: show terra firma here um in 19 uh to the current standards then uh second street here um and also has as well right here

48
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:22,473
[SPEAKER_05]: just to give you a 360 here just so you're aware I think it was your connection was cutting out a little bit in that last bit so I didn't I apologize yeah no worries thank you for letting me know so this is

49
00:04:23,912 --> 00:04:27,175
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the one family structure that's currently there now.

50
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:31,678
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a outbuilding garage as well.

51
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:39,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We're proposing to let both of those, to raise both of these and then construct the following.

52
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:47,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the prior design and which everybody said, please change.

53
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:49,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I always like to start with the pretty picture.

54
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:52,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the before, and this is the after.

55
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I went with the owner and the architect.

56
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:05,227
[SPEAKER_02]: We walked the block, looked at things, took pictures, and tried to make it more in line with the architecture that's in the neighborhood already.

57
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:10,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, something on a separate screen.

58
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:12,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, we still see the Google maps.

59
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

60
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:14,947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:18,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let me see if it's just, uh, there we go.

62
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:19,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

63
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see the new design here?

64
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:22,931
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

65
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:23,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we see the new design.

66
00:05:24,052 --> 00:05:24,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

67
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:28,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, let me see if I can do the before and after this is the before.

68
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:39,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of plain and we now, I like to say, gave it more definition brought it into consistency with what we see in the neighborhood as well.

69
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:57,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the big things is that we removed, this is, we had a neighbor that wrote in about massing and also feeling like it's still a neighborhood and things like that.

70
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:02,524
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we did was remove right here was a balcony on the old design.

71
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,485
[SPEAKER_02]: We removed the balcony facing second street.

72
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:10,878
[SPEAKER_02]: and put them here facing in the street.

73
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to give you a before and after, again, here's the before.

74
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:20,904
[SPEAKER_02]: It had balconies on both ends facing second street and nothing in the middle.

75
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:32,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we changed it to a smaller massing plus in the front instead of facing neighbors on the sides.

76
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,353
[SPEAKER_02]: We also shrink the footprint.

77
00:06:36,414 --> 00:06:39,937
[SPEAKER_02]: by a combined gross of 154 square feet.

78
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:42,379
[SPEAKER_02]: We reduced our lot coverage from 41.7 to 39.2.

79
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:45,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we reduced the height about a foot as well from 29.4 to 28.6.

80
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:07,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to start with, we also reduced the square footage of each floor as well as we reduced the footprint.

81
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:17,102
[SPEAKER_02]: The square footage went down from, it was 6,282 to 6,128.

82
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:35,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause we, we had, we listened and we heard that, you know, neighbors didn't want a lot of massing.

83
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:38,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all wanted to have a consistency with the neighborhood.

84
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,223
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is what we came up with.

85
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:50,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I'm just gonna, you know, if you want to walk through it, Mr. Fringos, my architect is online here.

86
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we reduced the square footage of, uh, this is.

87
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:02,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start here, this is the basement area, the living room, a bedroom, and bath.

88
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:09,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to the second floor, the first floor, which is an entryway.

89
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:12,324
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a mirror, so it's a duplex.

90
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:20,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a half a bath here, but also a kitchen, dining room, living room.

91
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:25,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Going up to, here is the second floor.

92
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:35,055
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got another two bedrooms and a stairway with primary bathroom with a primary bedroom and a bathroom over here.

93
00:08:35,836 --> 00:08:45,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the top floor, we have a suite, a bedroom suite up here with another bath, uh, which would be replicated on either side.

94
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:54,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, these are, this is the square area and also the roof plan and,

95
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to the pretty picture, there we go.

96
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:03,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is also the parking, we are parking compliant with two person dwelling unit.

97
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:11,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a bit about, let's see, can you see my zoning chart?

98
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:16,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to ask these questions, I wish I could, but can you see my zoning chart, Mr. Chair?

99
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,291
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we are looking at the site plan.

100
00:09:21,732 --> 00:09:23,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go back, I updated my,

101
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:36,969
[SPEAKER_02]: zoning chart here to reflect what the original plan was and then the revised plan as well.

102
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's three variances that we're asking for that we can't do anything about.

103
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:45,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the lot area, width and depth because it was subdivided in 1919.

104
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are three other variances that we seek tonight.

105
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:55,822
[SPEAKER_02]: The front yard, we did bring it more into compliance.

106
00:09:56,382 --> 00:09:57,663
[SPEAKER_02]: It was at 11, we're making 11.4.

107
00:09:59,363 --> 00:10:08,946
[SPEAKER_02]: The rear yard, because the rear yard was, because it's smaller, it is reduced from 11 to seven.

108
00:10:10,386 --> 00:10:14,948
[SPEAKER_02]: But our lot coverage was 41, and now it is 39, a reduction of 2.5%.

109
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,094
[SPEAKER_02]: At 2.5, yeah, 2.5%.

110
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have increased the front yard as well.

111
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:33,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I'm going to, I have my architect here and we also have Mr. Mamounas, my client that is online.

112
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:38,424
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, we're here to answer any questions that you might have.

113
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Frangos is here for technical questions.

114
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:43,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

115
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:44,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

116
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:46,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Questions from the board so far?

117
00:10:50,406 --> 00:11:03,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, just in case I do have a, um, I do have the original plot plan if, if you need to see it, um, as well about what the proposed will look like.

118
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:06,115
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not update it with the new design.

119
00:11:06,455 --> 00:11:11,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, unfortunately our surveyor is on vacation, um, for most of August.

120
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:15,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, but this, there is just a few inches off either way.

121
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:17,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can see where the new proposed is.

122
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:22,181
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.

123
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:28,807
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that I think we discussed last time that I just want to touch on here again today.

124
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:41,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So my recollection is the rear yard setback, the variance is required because the actual front of the house changes with that proposal.

125
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,081
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not that the new structure is

126
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:50,287
[SPEAKER_05]: encroaching more on the rear yard than the existing structure.

127
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:57,532
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that the existing structure's rear yard is where essentially the parking is proposed today.

128
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:03,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's a structure facing the adjacent street.

129
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,298
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the side yard becomes the rear yard.

130
00:12:06,318 --> 00:12:06,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

131
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:08,340
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct, sir.

132
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:08,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

133
00:12:10,861 --> 00:12:12,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions from the board?

134
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, go ahead.

135
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:33,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I just wanted, I was looking at the lot matrix, the zoning matrix that you had up for a second.

136
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:43,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't sure if that was the same as what is on the plans from the city's server.

137
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:48,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we throw that table up again?

138
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:49,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.

139
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:49,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

140
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:58,237
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an updated chart and it is not on the city's website.

141
00:12:58,717 --> 00:12:59,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me make sure up here.

142
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everybody being able to see that?

143
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure.

144
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:59,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, do you have a specific question?

145
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:00,912
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thanks.

146
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:15,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Through you, Mr. Chair, I really wanted to just see that to evaluate what the change was from what we heard last month to this month and see the difference, which is enumerated here, so that's good.

147
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,117
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great.

148
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:22,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I have a couple of questions.

149
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:25,099
[SPEAKER_05]: One, have you had a chance to talk

150
00:14:26,338 --> 00:14:35,126
[SPEAKER_05]: to the abutting neighbor who wrote the letter in opposition about the new design?

151
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:37,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not personally.

152
00:14:40,108 --> 00:14:41,509
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my apologies.

153
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:43,129
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first time before Medford.

154
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,651
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of boards don't want me to do that.

155
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:48,251
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of boards do want me to do that.

156
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:53,273
[SPEAKER_02]: But most of the boards do not want me to contact people directly because I'm a lawyer.

157
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:56,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be more than happy to get in touch with them.

158
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:58,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not present them.

159
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:00,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it.

160
00:15:00,356 --> 00:15:01,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

161
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:02,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

162
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:03,537
[SPEAKER_05]: So apologies.

163
00:15:05,401 --> 00:15:08,909
[SPEAKER_05]: was using you in the plural sense.

164
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,580
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so yeah, I don't personally have a strong opinion about

165
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:17,557
[SPEAKER_05]: whether the lawyer should or shouldn't be doing that contact.

166
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:21,679
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more like collectively the youth project.

167
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Has there been a discussion with that?

168
00:15:24,701 --> 00:15:26,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I apologize.

169
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:28,023
[SPEAKER_02]: We have not reached out to that neighbor.

170
00:15:28,043 --> 00:15:36,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to appease them with a better neighborly design that they would have to look at.

171
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we concentrated on and removing that balcony because

172
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:43,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody likes balconies staring at them.

173
00:15:43,748 --> 00:15:46,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might have been a part of it.

174
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And then reducing the massing as well to bring down the height for them as well.

175
00:15:52,053 --> 00:15:54,195
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in line.

176
00:15:54,915 --> 00:16:07,222
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I wanted to do, I'm just going to stop sharing this for just a second and go back to the Google map just for a second.

177
00:16:07,603 --> 00:16:09,404
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I wanted to do was bring our

178
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:17,848
[SPEAKER_02]: our roof in line with the rest of the neighborhood, so to speak.

179
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:19,709
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just back out a second.

180
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:28,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also going to turn from... Come on now.

181
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:37,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it when it doesn't work.

182
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

183
00:16:39,881 --> 00:16:41,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Neighbors and the people across the street.

184
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:42,855
[SPEAKER_02]: street of around 27, 28 feet.

185
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:49,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We just wanted to make sure we weren't taller than everybody else.

186
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were just about a foot.

187
00:16:54,865 --> 00:16:57,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to bring us in line with that to also point out.

188
00:16:58,508 --> 00:16:59,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thanks.

189
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:04,853
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had a discussion in the last meeting where

190
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:20,472
[SPEAKER_05]: The building commissioner, who unfortunately I don't think he's here tonight, asked for more detail on the third floor so he could better understand whether this was two and a half versus three stories.

191
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:22,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I see there is more detail.

192
00:17:22,873 --> 00:17:25,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to talk through that.

193
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:26,135
[SPEAKER_05]: So it looks like

194
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:40,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in the plans, you're presenting a seven foot roof cut and that some of the space that was interior is now balcony.

195
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:57,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, if I understood correctly, it looked like some of the, um, storage space is being excluded from the square footage, but it wasn't completely clear to me from the plans.

196
00:17:58,173 --> 00:17:59,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So is that something we could talk through?

197
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:01,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

198
00:18:01,795 --> 00:18:07,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, I'm going to give that to Mr. Frangos, um, about the reduction of square footage or Peter as well.

199
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:08,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

200
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

201
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:16,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible to talk to the Mr. Frangos?

202
00:18:18,006 --> 00:18:18,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

203
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:19,747
[SPEAKER_02]: He just needs to take himself off mute.

204
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:21,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you take yourself off mute Bill?

205
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:36,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you able to see the third floor of the new design right now?

206
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:37,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still seeing?

207
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:40,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we're seeing the zoning chart.

208
00:18:41,434 --> 00:18:41,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

209
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to go back to the third floor here.

210
00:18:43,635 --> 00:18:44,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

211
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:45,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

212
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:46,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I was clicking on the wrong.

213
00:18:48,296 --> 00:19:02,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so yeah, the building commissioner had mentioned that, um, the interpretation I was at the, uh, occupiable space is to be,

214
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:07,134
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, is based on occupiable space, not habitable.

215
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:30,420
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, basically 50% of the occupiable space of the second floor, uh, would include, you know, open space, you know, porches, storage, whatever spaces included again, that's occupiable, you know, um,

216
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:37,842
[SPEAKER_06]: would go toward that, yeah, 50% of the second floor.

217
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:42,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And I apologize, the third floor, it's a little unclear.

218
00:19:42,524 --> 00:19:48,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a note that says porch that would be opened.

219
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:57,750
[SPEAKER_06]: It's somewhat easier to see it on the area plan, but- Oh, I can do the area plan, this one right here, sir?

220
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:01,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and if you can zoom in on that, Dede,

221
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:06,197
[SPEAKER_06]: be helpful on the lower left.

222
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:19,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you can zoom in even, yeah, there's a, the purple line that's around the perimeter of the, is the perimeter of the area.

223
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:29,844
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of muddy where the green area is where the area is, and it's kind of muddy because it's, I should have cleaned up the,

224
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:39,607
[SPEAKER_06]: the dormers, but those dormers are included in the porch and in the center space, obviously.

225
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:44,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Stairs, all that is included in that area.

226
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:46,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I see.

227
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:57,132
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm understanding correctly, the 881 square foot is the area of everything outlined in purple and colored in green.

228
00:20:58,172 --> 00:20:58,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

229
00:20:58,872 --> 00:20:59,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

230
00:20:59,633 --> 00:20:59,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

231
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:00,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

232
00:21:00,273 --> 00:21:00,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

233
00:21:01,784 --> 00:21:04,225
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my understanding.

234
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:09,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think with what the building commissioner clarified last time.

235
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:12,267
[SPEAKER_05]: So this does look like a half story to me.

236
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:18,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to do the before and after if you want just to show here's the before.

237
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:25,331
[SPEAKER_02]: On the third floor, there was a storage here and mechanical and things like that.

238
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:26,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was

239
00:21:29,134 --> 00:21:33,716
[SPEAKER_02]: 898 square feet, and now we've reduced to 881 square feet.

240
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:40,740
[SPEAKER_02]: And remove that, strike the mechanical and remove the big closet thing.

241
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, right.

242
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:50,800
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the prior plans, we were doing the map differently, we were excluding some areas.

243
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:56,384
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually even smaller than that few foot square footage difference.

244
00:21:56,404 --> 00:22:02,968
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, this square footage is capturing all the occupiable space.

245
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:07,210
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's less than half of the floor below it.

246
00:22:07,351 --> 00:22:09,232
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's a proper half story.

247
00:22:09,432 --> 00:22:11,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for walking us through that.

248
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:13,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

249
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:17,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Other questions from the board?

250
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:33,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not seeing any, and so.

251
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:38,893
[SPEAKER_03]: This is through you, Mr. Chair, to the applicant.

252
00:22:41,627 --> 00:23:01,060
[SPEAKER_03]: had there been some involvement with the building department in altering these plans so that they come in at what was the less than 50% square footage that we discussed at the last meeting?

253
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:08,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is this just not without, this is without any involvement from the building department?

254
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:20,197
[SPEAKER_06]: The intent was to set up a meeting via the owner, and I guess there was some miscommunication, so unfortunately, we did not.

255
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:22,079
[SPEAKER_06]: The intent was to meet with him.

256
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:29,507
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I... Yeah, from the last meeting, it was... His...

257
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:46,699
[SPEAKER_02]: We took everything to heart that he had to say, especially, and we reduced it more than I think he even wanted us to, to make sure we conformed with what his square footage would be.

258
00:23:46,719 --> 00:23:50,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, Bill, I didn't mean to cut you off.

259
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:50,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Go right ahead.

260
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,881
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's fine.

261
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:57,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Chris, just to add, so we didn't

262
00:23:58,462 --> 00:24:02,806
[SPEAKER_05]: require and like by process, we don't require that such a conversation happen.

263
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:07,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the commissioner had offered to have the, um, discussion.

264
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:16,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it matches my understanding of the definition of half story and the commissioner clarified

265
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:21,904
[SPEAKER_05]: publicly what that was last month, so I'm comfortable proceeding.

266
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:30,712
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't be voting in this case on a variance for three stories because 2.5 is allowed by right.

267
00:24:30,812 --> 00:24:43,022
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the unlikely event that the Commissioner disagrees, this would anyway need to come back before us to revise the relief.

268
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:57,840
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, other questions or comments from the board before we open it up to public comment?

269
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:07,586
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, seeing none, I will open it up to public comment.

270
00:25:07,686 --> 00:25:12,209
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a member of the public and would like to speak on the matter, you may do so now.

271
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,931
[SPEAKER_05]: You can raise your hand on Zoom.

272
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn on your camera and raise your hand.

273
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:25,364
[SPEAKER_05]: You can type in the chat, or you can email Dennis, dmcdougall at edford-ma.gov.

274
00:25:34,348 --> 00:25:38,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not see any members of the public who would like to speak on this matter.

275
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:57,026
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'll just say the board did receive a letter in writing, which is in the public folder from the one abutter who is expressing some concerns about the original proposal.

276
00:25:57,046 --> 00:26:01,748
[SPEAKER_05]: And so yeah, we have that in the public record.

277
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:09,250
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so seeing no members of the public would like to speak on this matter, chair awaits a motion to

278
00:26:11,376 --> 00:26:13,937
[SPEAKER_05]: to close the public portion of the hearing and enter deliberation.

279
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:17,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Diavetta?

280
00:26:17,638 --> 00:26:21,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

281
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre LaRue?

282
00:26:24,481 --> 00:26:24,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

283
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:26,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim Tirani?

284
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:27,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

285
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:28,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike Caldera?

286
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:29,563
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

287
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:33,064
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we are now deliberating.

288
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:33,965
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think, folks?

289
00:26:45,023 --> 00:26:47,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris, go ahead.

290
00:26:47,525 --> 00:26:51,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's an improvement for sure over the last iteration that we saw.

291
00:26:53,309 --> 00:27:13,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as the building commissioner and the building department agree with the 50% on the third, then the only issue for us, I think, is to decide that the setbacks that are at issue here.

292
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:18,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Other thoughts from the board.

293
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:34,287
[SPEAKER_04]: 100 yeah, I feel like what we have here is reasonable.

294
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:37,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, enough, you know, I think.

295
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:44,770
[SPEAKER_04]: My biggest concern would be the height, but that is actually not it's under the height that is allowed.

296
00:27:44,951 --> 00:27:45,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, uh.

297
00:27:48,063 --> 00:27:55,128
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't think any of the dimensions are unreasonable in terms of the setbacks.

298
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:58,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Andre.

299
00:28:00,952 --> 00:28:01,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Thoughts, Jim?

300
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,400
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I can go next.

301
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,901
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so this is a general residence district.

302
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:20,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And so two family residents are allowed.

303
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:24,464
[SPEAKER_05]: The lot is undersized.

304
00:28:25,124 --> 00:28:31,606
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of other undersized families in the area.

305
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:31,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I

306
00:28:36,545 --> 00:28:54,554
[SPEAKER_05]: was a bit conflicted with the prior proposal because the house does sit mostly in a sea of two families, but then on a particular section of street, that's single family and the lot's undersized.

307
00:28:57,255 --> 00:29:04,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Clearly, given the shape of the lot, I think we can demonstrate the,

308
00:29:06,498 --> 00:29:10,704
[SPEAKER_05]: the association between the shape of the lot and the requested relief.

309
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a bit long and narrow.

310
00:29:13,808 --> 00:29:22,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there isn't really a good orientation of the house that would comply with all of the setback requirements.

311
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:31,375
[SPEAKER_05]: My interpretation of the prior plans is that it was in fact a three story and it was, I think the massing was a bit large.

312
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:36,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It had more of an impact on the abutting neighbor who was opposed to the plan.

313
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:42,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I'm seeing an improvement from a design perspective.

314
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:43,502
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks quite nice.

315
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It fits the neighborhood.

316
00:29:45,023 --> 00:29:53,668
[SPEAKER_05]: The massing faces away from that neighbor who was opposed to the

317
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:59,269
[SPEAKER_05]: design and the height is in line with the neighborhood.

318
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:11,638
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the applicant has made some good design choices and it's a, yeah, it's a modest building plan that's consistent with the neighborhood.

319
00:30:11,718 --> 00:30:15,761
[SPEAKER_05]: So I also don't have reservations.

320
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,643
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm generally supportive.

321
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:21,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from the board?

322
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:42,775
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, just before anyone makes a motion, I just want to make sure that we specifically talk through each of the variances being sought here.

323
00:30:42,795 --> 00:30:49,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the variance.

324
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,783
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to pull it up on my end, but yeah, that way it's just easy to go, sir.

325
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:57,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

326
00:30:57,304 --> 00:30:57,825
[SPEAKER_05]: So the.

327
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:02,890
[SPEAKER_05]: The lot area, they can't change that.

328
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:13,141
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of the lots in this neighborhood, including the many double, where the two family lots are about this size.

329
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:19,168
[SPEAKER_05]: The width and depth of the lot, like I said, it's narrow.

330
00:31:20,369 --> 00:31:20,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And then

331
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:28,750
[SPEAKER_05]: because of that narrowness, no matter how you have the house face, you're going to run into issues with the setback.

332
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:36,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we have a structure that's similar in the footprint to the existing house.

333
00:31:36,653 --> 00:31:43,235
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just changing the way that it's, or at least along the width of the lot.

334
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:45,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're just changing the way it's facing.

335
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:51,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I think the shape of the lot

336
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:57,941
[SPEAKER_05]: presents a hardship if we literally apply the zoning ordinance.

337
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:11,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, the variances required here are for lot area, lot width, lot depth, front yard, rear yard, setback, and the lot coverage.

338
00:32:11,667 --> 00:32:16,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the lot coverage is pretty close.

339
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:18,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's only a little bit over.

340
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,111
[SPEAKER_05]: So I view that as de minimis.

341
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:25,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from the board?

342
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:30,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair?

343
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:33,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Chris.

344
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:50,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think overall, as we start to think about the context of a lot of these variances, in denser neighborhoods, that taking and asking

345
00:32:52,432 --> 00:33:02,515
[SPEAKER_03]: basically dividing into two, like 15 foot rear yard setback to 7.7 is significant.

346
00:33:02,695 --> 00:33:11,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should be more serious about taking that into consideration when we look at these proposals.

347
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:19,240
[SPEAKER_03]: The lot coverage to me is less in a way of an issue than the

348
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:32,572
[SPEAKER_03]: imposition of a large structure on someone's back, in which case this rear yard is someone's side yard.

349
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:38,654
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same as a typical rear yard.

350
00:33:40,534 --> 00:33:49,156
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is an important consideration to talk about, and it's something that

351
00:33:50,517 --> 00:34:04,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not as comfortable with these sorts of, you know, taking something and not coming close to what the required setback is.

352
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:09,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, fair point, Chris.

353
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:18,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, while it's not further encroaching on the neighbor's side yard, it is taller.

354
00:34:19,694 --> 00:34:22,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And the orientation of the house is different.

355
00:34:23,535 --> 00:34:24,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is an imposition.

356
00:34:26,896 --> 00:34:46,463
[SPEAKER_05]: That if it was a different hypothetical, and it's not changing the definition of rear yard on a corner lot, if we allowed, say, just a new house to be built closer to the neighbor in the rear yard and at the same height, it's not.

357
00:34:47,163 --> 00:34:47,763
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference.

358
00:34:47,783 --> 00:34:48,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is an impact there.

359
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:49,404
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good point.

360
00:34:57,467 --> 00:35:24,193
[SPEAKER_05]: What I can say with confidence is that for this, with the shape of this lot, if you were to orient a house in this manner and enforce the 15-foot rear yard setback, it would be a very narrow house.

361
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:33,866
[SPEAKER_05]: But that doesn't diminish the potential impact of having a rear yard closer to the neighbor.

362
00:35:34,226 --> 00:35:37,709
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a rear yard set back closer to the neighbor.

363
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a good call.

364
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from the board?

365
00:35:47,499 --> 00:35:49,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Chris, just a question for you.

366
00:35:49,541 --> 00:36:02,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the fact that before, I mean, what's now the rear proposed as the rear yard was the side yard before, because it was fronting on the other street.

367
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:08,815
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but I don't, the dimension itself hasn't really changed.

368
00:36:09,475 --> 00:36:14,199
[SPEAKER_04]: So are you concerned because it's, it's higher?

369
00:36:16,028 --> 00:36:17,429
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really closer.

370
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's maybe a little closer.

371
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,211
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.

372
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:25,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's less in height, isn't it, than was previously?

373
00:36:25,973 --> 00:36:28,534
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's more in height than previously.

374
00:36:29,435 --> 00:36:33,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So the existing structure is shorter than the present.

375
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:34,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the existing, yes.

376
00:36:34,638 --> 00:36:36,339
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the previous iteration, I meant.

377
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the height went down.

378
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,862
[SPEAKER_05]: What's driving the reduction in the

379
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:49,148
[SPEAKER_05]: front yard setback is the changing the front of the house.

380
00:36:49,408 --> 00:36:51,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So the existing structure fronts a different street.

381
00:36:52,269 --> 00:36:52,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

382
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,911
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, yeah, my point was not the front yard setback, but the rear yard setback.

383
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:06,394
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm essentially saying is these proposals are building larger structures than

384
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,161
[SPEAKER_03]: the setbacks can accommodate, obviously.

385
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:18,370
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of that seems that we should be amenable to what the size of the lot is, of course.

386
00:37:19,391 --> 00:37:25,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also a direct reflection on people wanting to build larger houses on smaller lots.

387
00:37:26,178 --> 00:37:30,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's no reason that we need to

388
00:37:32,343 --> 00:37:45,195
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, of course there's no reason we need to approve or disapprove a blanket, you know, way of allowing such, you know, relief on setbacks.

389
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:58,727
[SPEAKER_03]: But my point is that it's taking something that's 15 feet and cutting that in half because the proposed project is as big as it is.

390
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:07,901
[SPEAKER_03]: they could build two smaller units on that and come a lot closer to the 15 feet rear yard setback.

391
00:38:09,682 --> 00:38:17,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just because the units are larger that we're at this, where we are right now.

392
00:38:19,468 --> 00:38:26,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a sort of general question that I don't want to occupy time with for this proposal, but

393
00:38:27,724 --> 00:38:30,606
[SPEAKER_03]: does, this isn't a good example of it.

394
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:48,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'd like to make the point that folks could come in with a smaller application and be much closer to the allowed setbacks.

395
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:50,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the point.

396
00:38:50,897 --> 00:38:56,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have anything against this particular development, but it does seem like it's

397
00:38:57,917 --> 00:38:58,858
[SPEAKER_03]: too close in the back.

398
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:11,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris, I'll just say, I agree with your point citywide.

399
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:25,273
[SPEAKER_05]: One factor I intend to consider in this case is the neighborhood and how the structures are oriented

400
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,402
[SPEAKER_05]: other structures are oriented in the neighborhood.

401
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:31,224
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

402
00:39:32,025 --> 00:39:38,651
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, a proposal like this doesn't just auto get one decision or the other.

403
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:47,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have very different feelings about it depending on the surrounding properties.

404
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:59,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree, context is important, and this is a more densely oriented and developed neighborhood.

405
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,604
[SPEAKER_03]: So that plays into the context of what we're talking about.

406
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:18,697
[SPEAKER_03]: But my point, I think, still stands, which is we're seeing more and more proposals that don't take the setbacks into much consideration.

407
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,661
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.

408
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Other thoughts from the board?

409
00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:36,731
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair awaits a motion on this matter.

410
00:40:37,232 --> 00:40:51,644
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have an application for 131 2nd Avenue requesting variances for lot area, lot width, lot depth, front yard setback, rear yard setback, and lot coverage.

411
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:01,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Andre?

412
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:05,682
[SPEAKER_04]: A motion to approve the variances for 121 Second Avenue.

413
00:41:05,702 --> 00:41:09,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I have a second?

414
00:41:10,704 --> 00:41:11,304
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second.

415
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:13,105
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

416
00:41:13,605 --> 00:41:16,086
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to take a roll call.

417
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:17,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim?

418
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:17,987
Aye.

419
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:19,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris?

420
00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:21,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

421
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:23,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Andre?

422
00:41:23,269 --> 00:41:24,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

423
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:26,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Mike?

424
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

425
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Shall we have four in favor?

426
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:35,086
[SPEAKER_05]: which meets the requirement for a variance.

427
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:38,751
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the variances are approved.

428
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:42,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, gentlemen.

429
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:43,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

430
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:47,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, can you please describe the next step?

431
00:41:47,086 --> 00:41:47,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

432
00:41:48,126 --> 00:41:51,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, I'm going to start with you, attorney Emerson Corl.

433
00:41:52,547 --> 00:41:59,469
[SPEAKER_01]: In these cases, if someone has an attorney representing them, I usually just ask them to come up with a draft decision.

434
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:07,091
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want, I'll send you a link to where like our drafts, like our old decisions are kept so you get an idea of the format, especially the recent ones.

435
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:08,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

436
00:42:08,132 --> 00:42:09,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

437
00:42:10,212 --> 00:42:12,053
[SPEAKER_01]: So go through that and just, you know, sort of

438
00:42:14,015 --> 00:42:17,677
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out some of those and just sort of, that way you get at least the formatting down and how we sort of structure them.

439
00:42:18,217 --> 00:42:21,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you get that to me and then I'll go over it.

440
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:29,744
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I still at that point, I'll send it off to our legal counsel here just for the, they do a quick check.

441
00:42:30,404 --> 00:42:33,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once that's back from them, it goes up to signatures.

442
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:39,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we get signatures in, I file it in the clerk's office and that starts the 20 days appeals period.

443
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:40,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.

444
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:48,333
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of that 20 days appeals period, as long as there's no appeal, you go to the clerk's office and you ask them for a letter of no appeal.

445
00:42:49,214 --> 00:42:53,456
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll provide it to you and then gets filed in the, uh, registry of deeds.

446
00:42:53,576 --> 00:42:54,416
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get your permit.

447
00:42:55,757 --> 00:43:06,101
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see that in the, in all of the emails that I had putting in the system that we, is it accurate that we need to go before the historic commission as well?

448
00:43:07,122 --> 00:43:07,202
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

449
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:09,575
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, let me check to see what they've said.

450
00:43:10,236 --> 00:43:11,356
[SPEAKER_01]: I can check on CitizenServe.

451
00:43:11,696 --> 00:43:13,716
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually will comment if they do.

452
00:43:13,736 --> 00:43:17,417
[SPEAKER_01]: What year is the building?

453
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:17,417
1940?

454
00:43:17,917 --> 00:43:17,417
1920.

455
00:43:17,937 --> 00:43:22,219
[SPEAKER_01]: 1920.

456
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:22,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, then definitely anything older than 75.

457
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:30,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to wait till the outcome of this meeting and to apply for everything for that.

458
00:43:30,961 --> 00:43:35,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to make sure you knew that we will be submitting that forthwith.

459
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:39,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily for you, I also help staff the historical commission.

460
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:45,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes in for the permit, they'll, so what's going to happen in that case?

461
00:43:46,007 --> 00:43:52,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, I would say they meet the second.

462
00:43:53,522 --> 00:44:06,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesdays of the month so I would say send them a letter almost right away and at least get the process started because the first thing they do is that they basically either prove you know basically that it'll sort of help save a step so I would say I'll

463
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:23,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Send you their contact info and you just shoot them an email saying that, you know, this is what we want to do and just sort of because if you can get on the agenda for the next meeting would be September 8th, which at least initially just get the process rolling.

464
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:26,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what they usually do is they accept it and then they'll

465
00:44:26,677 --> 00:44:35,581
[SPEAKER_01]: basically say what they do is they basically have an architect that they contract out to do a study of the property.

466
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:46,326
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do that, they can just do both of those first steps beforehand and then skip a step because that'll save a step.

467
00:44:46,366 --> 00:44:48,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually it would be three meetings, that'll probably bump it down to two.

468
00:44:48,827 --> 00:44:49,888
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be a meeting in September.

469
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:52,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Odds are they are going to find it

470
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:59,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that it is worthy of actually having a hearing on most likely, given the age of the house, and it is a full demo.

471
00:44:59,885 --> 00:45:04,249
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then, you know, then in October would be the actual.

472
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:13,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Hearing date that they would have, but they can walk you through that process, but I will before I leave here tonight, I will shoot you their contact info and a link to their website.

473
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:16,239
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can thank you for all your help through this process.

474
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.

475
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:19,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

476
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:23,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Gentlemen, Mr. Chair and your member, thank you very much.

477
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:24,744
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

478
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:26,185
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, good night.

479
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:27,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night.

480
00:45:28,266 --> 00:45:29,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

481
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,371
[SPEAKER_05]: Next is administrative updates, is that right?

482
00:45:34,491 --> 00:45:35,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, exactly.

483
00:45:35,612 --> 00:45:46,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I sort of said before, the mayor's office is still working on process, got a little bit, you know, I think I sent an email to a couple of you about,

484
00:45:48,226 --> 00:45:49,167
[SPEAKER_01]: appointments and things like that.

485
00:45:49,227 --> 00:45:52,509
[SPEAKER_01]: So the process got a little bit lengthened out than it had been in the past.

486
00:45:52,869 --> 00:46:06,400
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did hear from the mayor last week and I think she was hoping to hopefully try to get someone on for today's, but it just wasn't able to.

487
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think she would, I think she might've been late, not honest, sure.

488
00:46:09,322 --> 00:46:16,127
[SPEAKER_01]: But so, but ideally, well, actually I can give you an, we actually right now do not have a single filing for next month.

489
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:32,337
[SPEAKER_01]: for I think the first time, and at least that I can recall, that soaps, as the only thing that could change that is if something comes in in the next week or so, but that would be unexpected, to be honest.

490
00:46:34,157 --> 00:46:42,940
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, and then the only other thing which might is someone comes in asking for a continuance, because that we can just get up to a few weeks, because we don't require advertising for that.

491
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,080
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but.

492
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:52,232
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, normally I get a sort of a heads up that people are going to do a continuance long before, you know, more than a month before they need it.

493
00:46:52,552 --> 00:47:03,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so Dennis, um, since it has been so long since this happened and we're probably going to jinx it simply by having this discussion, but, uh,

494
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:14,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I correct in my understanding that we don't actually have to meet in the event that there's no filings because there's no statutory timeline and it's just a scheduling matter?

495
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:14,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

496
00:47:15,304 --> 00:47:15,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

497
00:47:16,685 --> 00:47:16,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

498
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would sort of, you know, basically give us a month off.

499
00:47:22,669 --> 00:47:22,950
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

500
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:24,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the update.

501
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:26,933
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see any meeting minutes.

502
00:47:26,953 --> 00:47:27,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have meeting minutes?

503
00:47:27,874 --> 00:47:29,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I did them, but I must...

504
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I did them and then I was, but I realized I never actually sent them out.

505
00:47:34,882 --> 00:47:36,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're somewhere on my computer.

506
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:39,123
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will, I'll get them to you.

507
00:47:39,143 --> 00:47:42,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm out tomorrow, but I'll get them to you on Tuesday for next meeting.

508
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:43,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll do these as well.

509
00:47:43,505 --> 00:47:46,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So the AI stuff we have that has been working pretty well.

510
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:47,106
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

511
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:47,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.

512
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:48,307
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

513
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:49,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds good.

514
00:47:49,587 --> 00:47:51,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

515
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:55,169
[SPEAKER_05]: I make a motion to adjourn.

516
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:56,310
[SPEAKER_05]: A second.

517
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, I will take a roll call.

518
00:47:59,642 --> 00:48:02,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Andre.

519
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:03,526
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

520
00:48:04,567 --> 00:48:05,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

521
00:48:06,188 --> 00:48:06,749
[SPEAKER_05]: You're adjourned.

522
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:07,449
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

523
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:08,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks folks.

524
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,091
[SPEAKER_05]: See you later.
