1
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:04,053
Excuse me?

2
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:10,620
Oh, yes, yes.

3
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:16,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, sure, be my guest.

4
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,153
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford School Committee regular meeting of October 16 will now come to order.

5
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,235
[SPEAKER_13]: The secretary will call the roll.

6
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:36,944
[SPEAKER_13]: present, six present, one absent, all please rise and salute our flag.

7
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:50,228
[SPEAKER_13]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

8
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:57,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, if the minutes could reflect that Sebastian Trindale, our Meckler High School representative, is present this evening.

9
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:57,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

10
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:07,207
[SPEAKER_13]: The first item of business, approval of the minutes of October 2nd, 2017 on the motion for approval by Mr. Skerry and Mr. Benedetto.

11
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:10,809
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

12
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,130
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

13
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so there's a few things that I noticed on the minutes.

14
00:01:22,473 --> 00:01:23,393
[SPEAKER_07]: On the second page,

15
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:40,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I had made a motion last week to have internal rankings and notifications made on the transcript, and that if they couldn't be made, then we needed to have an emergency meeting.

16
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:46,356
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just wondering if the superintendent, we didn't call the meeting.

17
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:49,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the minutes stand on their own.

18
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:54,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it should have said by last week, by the end of last week, in the minutes.

19
00:01:55,938 --> 00:01:58,763
[SPEAKER_07]: the emergency meeting was supposed to happen by the end of last week.

20
00:01:59,163 --> 00:02:01,087
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the first, the first change.

21
00:02:01,107 --> 00:02:01,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

22
00:02:08,018 --> 00:02:08,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

23
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:11,086
[SPEAKER_00]: At that meeting, you made a motion.

24
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:16,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time, grievances were filed, the processes, legal matters were filed.

25
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:26,158
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, I want to discuss it with you in executive session because I believe it affects our legal status, and I believe that should be taken into account before any meetings are scheduled.

26
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:28,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

27
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the next section,

28
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:43,249
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, Mrs. Kretz said that the robotics engineering team are presently traditional classes, and in 2019 it's scheduled to go on a cooperative plan.

29
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:56,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she made a motion to have that happen, and I just wanted, I can ask you later about an update on it, but I just wanted to comment on that.

30
00:02:57,855 --> 00:02:59,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there, there isn't a question.

31
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:00,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you all set with your?

32
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:01,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

33
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Kurtz, did you have an amendment to the list?

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:34,843
[SPEAKER_11]: about the robotics engineering program and so if they go to the schedule which is three periods per day the company who's actually doing the co-op with the students would be willing to accept the students in the afternoon and they could work maybe a 12 to 5 schedule so it would still be a cooperative program but it would have a different schedule so that the students could continue on with their like with the calculus and

35
00:03:35,343 --> 00:03:41,066
[SPEAKER_11]: and the foreign language, which is something that some of the students that are juniors and seniors haven't taken.

36
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:44,868
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that would be satisfactory.

37
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:51,032
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was speaking to my son, who's out on co-op, because it's a lot to juggle.

38
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:54,875
[SPEAKER_11]: getting all the classes in, and then going to the co-op.

39
00:03:55,235 --> 00:04:08,006
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's definitely something, you know, if superintendent wants to have a meeting and we can talk about all the programs and, you know, just making sure that the programs who should be on co-ops are on co-ops on the A week and the B week.

40
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:14,688
[SPEAKER_11]: We did get a report in this package with who is going out on co-op.

41
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,449
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that'll come up later in the program.

42
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:20,430
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to share that point of information.

43
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,811
[SPEAKER_07]: My other two are exactly about the minutes themselves.

44
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:32,233
[SPEAKER_07]: On the next thing, community participation, there also was a motion made to have the teachers, the administration,

45
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:41,235
[SPEAKER_07]: and the school committee meet to update the action plan to make sure all voices were on that action plan.

46
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:43,915
[SPEAKER_07]: That note, that motion isn't in the notes.

47
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:47,096
[SPEAKER_07]: And that motion was made at our last meeting.

48
00:04:47,516 --> 00:04:51,997
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can discuss it after, but as far as just the minutes, that's what you want, right?

49
00:04:52,017 --> 00:04:56,318
[SPEAKER_13]: This- The motion for the amendment to be added to the minutes from last week prior to their approval.

50
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's one more issue.

51
00:04:59,524 --> 00:05:04,587
[SPEAKER_07]: It says on the motion of Mrs. Cuneo, second by Mrs. Stone, that the meeting was adjourned.

52
00:05:04,627 --> 00:05:05,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Cuneo wasn't there.

53
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:09,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So that couldn't have been her.

54
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,212
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the only other correction on the minutes themselves.

55
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:16,655
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the superintendent wanted to comment on anything, that's fine.

56
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:19,397
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion for approval of minutes as amended,

57
00:05:25,227 --> 00:05:26,588
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed, the minutes have passed.

58
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

59
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

60
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

61
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:34,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on the floor?

62
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, second.

63
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Second by Ms.

64
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:36,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Krutz.

65
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:37,737
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

66
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:38,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

67
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:40,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a quick question on page nine of 13.

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:50,646
[SPEAKER_07]: It says MMH Clearinghouse, and it's over $10,000, and it says youth opiate prevention.

69
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,728
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just had never seen that on our,

70
00:05:53,767 --> 00:05:58,751
[SPEAKER_13]: on our bills before, and I was just wondering what that was.

71
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:02,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and what types of things does that cover?

72
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:03,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Curriculum.

73
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:04,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's the curriculum?

74
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:04,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

75
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:09,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's taught through the superintendent.

76
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:13,521
[SPEAKER_07]: What age group is getting the curriculum?

77
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,462
[SPEAKER_07]: The opioid grant.

78
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:15,483
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the opioid grant.

79
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,044
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the expansion of the Michigan model.

80
00:06:17,484 --> 00:06:18,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and that's great.

81
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:22,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hadn't seen it on the bills, and I just like to know what's going on.

82
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:23,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

83
00:06:24,207 --> 00:06:25,808
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my only question on bills.

84
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:26,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

85
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:30,312
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Mr. Scarey, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

86
00:06:30,352 --> 00:06:31,112
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

87
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:32,514
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

88
00:06:32,534 --> 00:06:33,334
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes.

89
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:37,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of payrolls.

90
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:41,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Mr. Scarey, seconded by Ms.

91
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:41,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Kretz.

92
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:43,102
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

93
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,803
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

94
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:45,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

95
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:47,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Report of secretary.

96
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. Scarrion, for working on this.

97
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Community participation, Joseph Viglione, Open Meeting Law.

98
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:14,117
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

99
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:18,640
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Joe Viglione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

100
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, school committee, for hearing me.

101
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:26,948
[SPEAKER_22]: On September 19th, 2017, the Attorney General's office found that the

102
00:07:28,426 --> 00:07:31,327
[SPEAKER_22]: Chapter 74 board of the school had violated the open meeting law.

103
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:36,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Now this is a very serious offense, even though some people fluffed it off at the city council meeting.

104
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:48,016
[SPEAKER_22]: Very serious offense, especially in the light of the 650,000 or so dollars that were allocated from the old TV3 to the new station.

105
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,958
[SPEAKER_22]: So what are we gonna do about it?

106
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,220
[SPEAKER_22]: You have a board for a year and a half,

107
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,624
[SPEAKER_22]: The school committee, I don't believe, knew about it.

108
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:01,506
[SPEAKER_22]: The city council certainly didn't know about it.

109
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:15,418
[SPEAKER_22]: It flies under the radar, but it was so significant because Bob Penter and other citizens and myself were attending all of Mayor McGlynn's tribunals, which were talking about the new access station.

110
00:08:15,438 --> 00:08:21,283
[SPEAKER_22]: And all of a sudden, the high school is talking about the access station, but the public doesn't know.

111
00:08:22,604 --> 00:08:30,610
[SPEAKER_22]: If the MCC monies are here, and the educational monies are here, and the governmental monies are there, and the general fund, it's all convoluted.

112
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:33,252
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been on this project for 15 years.

113
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:34,894
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm not that dumb.

114
00:08:35,194 --> 00:08:36,295
[SPEAKER_22]: I can't figure it out.

115
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:37,616
[SPEAKER_22]: The public can't.

116
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:50,205
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think that this serious, serious offense of not letting us know about this Chapter 74 board, which had people that weren't even from Medford, Revere and outside of Medford, all very, very

117
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Smoky.

118
00:08:52,861 --> 00:08:55,203
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I propose something.

119
00:08:55,984 --> 00:09:02,270
[SPEAKER_22]: I propose, especially after the media day yesterday at the public access station, which seemed so very educational oriented.

120
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,674
[SPEAKER_22]: Politicians, neighbors of mine are saying, I didn't hear about it, Joe.

121
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:10,377
[SPEAKER_22]: Anthony D'Antonio, a significant member of the Medford community.

122
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Joe, I didn't know about it.

123
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,740
[SPEAKER_22]: I spoke about it at the city council.

124
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,061
[SPEAKER_22]: There was no outreach.

125
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:22,513
[SPEAKER_22]: I propose, because of this egregious offense, this failure, I mean, we have very smart people here.

126
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:23,634
[SPEAKER_22]: The mayor's a very smart woman.

127
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,234
[SPEAKER_22]: Superintendent Belson's a very smart man.

128
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:30,575
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't feign ignorance that, oh, we didn't know about the open meeting laws.

129
00:09:30,755 --> 00:09:34,256
[SPEAKER_22]: My God, you people have to take tests for the open meeting law.

130
00:09:35,636 --> 00:09:42,758
[SPEAKER_22]: I feel, sadly, that my opinion is it was intentional to keep me out, specifically, because I've been fighting for public access

131
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:53,352
[SPEAKER_22]: in this city for 15 years, but many might know that I fought the good fight in Woburn for a good five years, and I'm a member in Stoneham, and Woburn airs my show.

132
00:09:53,452 --> 00:10:00,376
[SPEAKER_22]: It was my strength that made that right up there, and we all know that it was my fight that shut down TV3.

133
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:03,178
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think it would have been prudent

134
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:10,625
[SPEAKER_22]: for this city to let me, Bob Penter, and Antonio, and other individuals know, and the city council, and the school committee.

135
00:10:11,706 --> 00:10:21,212
[SPEAKER_22]: So, especially yesterday, I feel very uncomfortable having it at the high school when a state rep acted in an inappropriate manner, and the mayor laughed.

136
00:10:22,472 --> 00:10:23,913
[SPEAKER_13]: I am staying within the area.

137
00:10:24,213 --> 00:10:26,835
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, you don't know because you laughed at the sexual joke.

138
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,737
[SPEAKER_22]: You laughed, so you're shutting me off.

139
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:29,417
[SPEAKER_22]: Censorship.

140
00:10:29,917 --> 00:10:33,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, you can leave this meeting if you cannot be a responsible adult.

141
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,703
[SPEAKER_22]: You laughed at a sexual outrage and you don't want it talked about.

142
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:40,185
[SPEAKER_13]: The mayor will rule you out of the water.

143
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:41,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Please leave the building.

144
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:43,127
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

145
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:55,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Ask a question through the chair.

146
00:10:58,406 --> 00:10:59,446
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no recommendation.

147
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:01,887
[SPEAKER_13]: We've already taken care of it.

148
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:04,288
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a chapter 74 advisory board.

149
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:05,988
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't deliberate.

150
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:08,109
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't make decisions for the school system.

151
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:09,849
[SPEAKER_13]: All the meetings will be posted.

152
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:10,730
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been taken care of.

153
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

154
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,310
[SPEAKER_13]: Next item.

155
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Next item.

156
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Report of superintendent.

157
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:20,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on Nellie Mae Education Foundation grant.

158
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:21,373
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

159
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:40,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Mayor and members of the committee, you have a report on the Nellie Mae Educators Foundation grant.

160
00:11:41,437 --> 00:11:47,882
[SPEAKER_00]: With us this evening is our Director of Guidance, Amelia Jensen, along with Tim Kline, who's the recipient of the O2 award.

161
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:50,485
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very significant award.

162
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,807
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done a lot of very good things for us.

163
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:53,627
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do even more.

164
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let them explain it to you in great detail.

165
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:01,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, members of the school committee.

166
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:11,657
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very excited to be here tonight to announce that one of our school counselors, Tim Klein, has won the Lawrence O'Toole Educator Leadership Award and grant for

167
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:26,564
[SPEAKER_06]: This award is given to an educator who advocates for student-centered approaches to learning, not only in their classroom but within their practice.

168
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:34,570
[SPEAKER_06]: This award is sponsored by the Nellie Mae Foundation and this year was given to 12 recipients across New England.

169
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:42,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim has won this award as a result of his innovative pilot program, Empower, which was started last year at the high school.

170
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:56,963
[SPEAKER_06]: The Lawrence O'Toole Award is also accompanied with a $15,000 grant, and this grant will be used to bring innovative digital technology to the MPower program, which will help us grow this program over the next three years.

171
00:12:58,984 --> 00:13:07,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Tim here, and I would like to ask him to give you a brief summary of the program and to answer any questions that you may have of the work that he's been doing.

172
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:09,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Mr. Klein.

173
00:13:10,045 --> 00:13:10,465
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

174
00:13:10,525 --> 00:13:11,326
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for having me.

175
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:16,670
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I'm really excited to be here and to win this award on behalf of Medford Public Schools.

176
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:25,757
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's from Empower, which it started from the research partnership that Dr. Perella started with Harvard University and Boston College.

177
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:31,140
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's based in this emerging field in youth development called youth purpose.

178
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:41,227
[SPEAKER_21]: And so that's how do we ensure that all of our high school students are actively pursuing a long-term goal that's personally meaningful and also is beneficial to the world outside the self.

179
00:13:41,727 --> 00:13:49,650
[SPEAKER_21]: So honestly, when I'm sitting up here, we want all of our students to be looking like Sebastian up here, who's obviously actively pursuing something that's meaningful to him.

180
00:13:49,731 --> 00:14:04,037
[SPEAKER_21]: So empower is really about asking students not just to consider what college they want to go to or what major or what career, but really to understand why they want to pursue those things, how it aligns with their core values, how it's going to allow them to build their strength and skills.

181
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:06,378
[SPEAKER_21]: So to understand the intrinsic motivators.

182
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:13,179
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really excited for this award because we've piloted this with seniors in the high school and the vocational school.

183
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,480
[SPEAKER_21]: We did it last year with 25 students.

184
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,900
[SPEAKER_21]: We've tripled the number this year.

185
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,622
[SPEAKER_21]: But this award is going to allow us to really bring in really innovative digital technology and curriculum that we can bring.

186
00:14:24,662 --> 00:14:34,584
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's going to allow us to bring in an application that not only me and our Empower students can use, but the entirety of the public school district can use as well when we get it out there.

187
00:14:34,885 --> 00:14:36,965
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm really excited to bring this to Medford Public Schools.

188
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:38,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice job.

189
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:38,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

190
00:14:38,846 --> 00:14:39,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

191
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:40,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

192
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:43,409
[SPEAKER_15]: First and foremost, thank you and congratulations.

193
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,391
[SPEAKER_15]: This is absolutely wonderful.

194
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:53,016
[SPEAKER_15]: These are always the innovative programs that we're always looking for and I appreciate your department and Ms.

195
00:14:53,136 --> 00:14:53,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Westmark.

196
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,121
[SPEAKER_15]: I've known her before she was married.

197
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,823
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to say thank you to you for all that you've done.

198
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:10,968
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just wondering, I have actually spoken like in the past with the chamber and other organizations in our city.

199
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:27,114
[SPEAKER_15]: that it would really be beneficial, I think, and speaking to others, that I think this would go hand in hand if we're able to put, like, our students into the community and have them have, like, some type of internship with the businesses or fields

200
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,351
[SPEAKER_15]: My concentration went away, but different types of businesses.

201
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:54,204
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to see, if possible, maybe a collaboration that I know businesses are really interested in having our students and what better way to give our students that are here in the city the opportunity to maybe look into the field that they're interested in.

202
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:58,728
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you have people that are interested in business, maybe do something in the business field.

203
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:05,925
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we have the vocational side, but I think it's nice to open up another door.

204
00:16:06,626 --> 00:16:09,968
[SPEAKER_15]: But I've also spoken to the businesses that we want to be very careful.

205
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:14,131
[SPEAKER_15]: I want our students to get the opportunity to go and see those fields.

206
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,274
[SPEAKER_15]: But if it's something down the road that they could continue working in, then our students need to be paid.

207
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:22,736
[SPEAKER_15]: They can't just always do everything voluntarily.

208
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:25,978
[SPEAKER_15]: So I was just wondering what your thoughts were on something like that.

209
00:16:28,357 --> 00:16:43,318
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean I think it's a fantastic idea it's amazing I mean I tried working with Sebastian not to keep bringing you up but we tried doing the same thing with Sebastian and I'm all for it and it's greed it's you want internships that's providing value for our students what I've been

210
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:47,500
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been a struggle for me is around scheduling flexibility.

211
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:55,023
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's just having students having a flexible enough schedule so maybe they could leave during the school day or getting credit for those internships.

212
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:57,164
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think it's a fantastic, fantastic idea.

213
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:06,988
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you know people from the Chamber of Commerce, let's definitely set up a meeting where we can start connecting with students who might be interested with businesses that would be a good fit.

214
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:10,369
[SPEAKER_15]: And even if it's something that if the students can't do during

215
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,361
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if there's any time in classes.

216
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:22,604
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe there's something that could be worked out like after school, or maybe in a Saturday, or if the business is open.

217
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:32,383
[SPEAKER_15]: want to see kids, you know, I just don't want them going there and sweeping or anything like that.

218
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:44,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that you shouldn't, but I really want them to get the passion of what they're there for because I think it opens up their eyes to see if it's something that they're really interested in and they want to pursue or if it's something they thought they were interested in.

219
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,385
[SPEAKER_06]: to come to Mr. Kline, because he is our school and community partnerships counselor, so he makes those connections.

220
00:17:54,425 --> 00:18:00,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Come to Mr. Kline, maybe tell them what they're looking for, and he can help make that connection.

221
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also encourage community members to reach out to us as well.

222
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.

223
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:04,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

224
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:05,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

225
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:06,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Turingale.

226
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:06,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

227
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:14,302
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, directly from a high schooler's perspective, working with the guidance counselors, especially applying to colleges this year.

228
00:18:16,644 --> 00:18:22,949
[SPEAKER_19]: My personal guidance counselor has tons of students, and they're working with students from all over the school all the time.

229
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,853
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it's great that Mr. Klein is here to be that extra hand.

230
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:33,877
[SPEAKER_19]: I worked with him almost immediately as soon as he came to the high school to try to get

231
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:46,425
[SPEAKER_19]: some, you know, internships and again, you know, I'm a really busy guy and so are tons of my classmates end up not, you know, I never, you know, followed through with that internship.

232
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:56,172
[SPEAKER_19]: But I think that, you know, what is already being done, I guess, is, you know, he's doing a great job with that.

233
00:18:58,334 --> 00:18:58,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

234
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:04,398
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I think from that conversation, you got into journalism, and then you started the school newspaper, essentially, right?

235
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:05,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

236
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:05,499
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

237
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,020
[SPEAKER_19]: Essentially, it was that conversation.

238
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:13,124
[SPEAKER_19]: And to give a back story, I was thinking about business, and Mr. Klein talked me through it.

239
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:19,829
[SPEAKER_19]: And I realized I didn't really want to do business and thought more about journalism, another field I was passionate about.

240
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:22,571
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't think I would have had that conversation

241
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:30,775
[SPEAKER_19]: with my guidance counselor, because I think she was just really wrapped up in getting kids applied to colleges and all of those things.

242
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:32,936
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it's great.

243
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:36,038
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it's great that you won this grant to expand your program.

244
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:37,657
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.

245
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:38,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

246
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:39,979
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'll just make one more pitch.

247
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,761
[SPEAKER_21]: It wouldn't have happened without Ms.

248
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:50,810
[SPEAKER_21]: Jetson here just allowing me, no, to do like a really innovative work that hadn't been happening before, not only in Medford, but it hasn't really been happening anywhere.

249
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,172
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just want to make a plug for our guidance team as well.

250
00:19:53,212 --> 00:20:00,419
[SPEAKER_21]: Like what you heard Sebastian said, it's they feel very, very at capacity and it feels like they have a very high caseload and it's like,

251
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:11,705
[SPEAKER_21]: If we can build up more guidance counselor capacity to have these meaningful conversations about what do they want their lives to look like, what type of impact they want to have, it can have a very profound impact on our students.

252
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:17,149
[SPEAKER_21]: So I just think the role of the counselors is as important as ever now, and I'm glad to be one at Medford.

253
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:17,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

254
00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:22,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe you could add a little bit from that breakfast last year when you had the Chamber of Commerce in and vocational.

255
00:20:23,312 --> 00:20:23,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

256
00:20:23,552 --> 00:20:26,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Sawyer, I believe, was the one leading the charge over on the vocational side.

257
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:29,096
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe just elaborate a little bit more about your outreach.

258
00:20:29,955 --> 00:20:38,498
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so we had the Chamber of Commerce come in, and they came out for a breakfast, and the vocational students catered an amazing breakfast.

259
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:47,522
[SPEAKER_21]: And I did do a presentation about the need for our students and their desire to get out into the city of Medford to get hands-on experience.

260
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:51,903
[SPEAKER_21]: So I did some research on what the school resources we had now.

261
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:55,105
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have over 100 clubs at the school.

262
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:58,846
[SPEAKER_21]: And about 85% of our students are actively involved in the school.

263
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:03,712
[SPEAKER_21]: And we did a survey of students saying, well, what would you like to get more involved with?

264
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:09,078
[SPEAKER_21]: And the majority of students who said they wanted to do more, it was around meaningful employment.

265
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:11,861
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you look at research now about what

266
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:22,789
[SPEAKER_21]: When you look at what employers are looking for from recent college graduates, they're really emphasizing meaningful employment and job experience.

267
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:31,032
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're getting to a place in the world where it's not so much what college you go to or what grades you have, but it's really more about what meaningful experience in the field do you have.

268
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:42,915
[SPEAKER_21]: So as much as we can get students out into the field to actually give them experience, they can understand what they do want to do, what they don't want to do, and make really meaningful connections in the city of Medford that's going to help them

269
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:48,919
[SPEAKER_21]: help this city and get, and help our, a lot of our jobs are having a hard time finding meaningful employment.

270
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:53,662
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's really a mutually beneficial relationship for both.

271
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:54,843
[SPEAKER_21]: But, yes.

272
00:21:55,203 --> 00:21:55,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

273
00:21:55,943 --> 00:21:56,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

274
00:21:56,143 --> 00:21:56,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Kratz.

275
00:21:57,284 --> 00:21:58,825
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say congratulations.

276
00:21:58,945 --> 00:21:59,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

277
00:22:00,106 --> 00:22:07,511
[SPEAKER_11]: And I noticed that it said that, you know, the students have increased GPAs and post-secondary plans.

278
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:12,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to bring attention to that and increase graduation rate.

279
00:22:12,417 --> 00:22:13,679
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fantastic.

280
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:21,910
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds like you're going in the right direction and you're involving both the vocational students and high school students.

281
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,051
[SPEAKER_11]: It just sounds terrific.

282
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:30,139
[SPEAKER_11]: get in touch with you, should they email you or do they go through their guidance counselor?

283
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,481
[SPEAKER_11]: Which students?

284
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:42,091
[SPEAKER_11]: If students were, you know, interested and, you know, kind of spending some time with you to find out what their interests are, should they go through their guidance counselor and then they're put in touch with you or?

285
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:43,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, I have

286
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:48,836
[SPEAKER_21]: This is probably not going to work out for me, but I have an open door policy, and I always have, so it's like they can come find me.

287
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:53,720
[SPEAKER_21]: So through Empower, I'll just say, it's being evaluated by Boston College right now.

288
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,201
[SPEAKER_21]: So right now, it's a randomized trial.

289
00:22:56,401 --> 00:23:02,305
[SPEAKER_21]: So every single high school senior was automatically randomly selected into the program.

290
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:06,088
[SPEAKER_21]: So we actually have an intervention, which is Empower, and then we have a control group as well.

291
00:23:06,448 --> 00:23:10,774
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're doing pre and post surveys for both of them to see what the actual impact of Empower is.

292
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:13,257
[SPEAKER_21]: But just send them my way.

293
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:14,739
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm third floor guidance.

294
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:18,083
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's just like I have students coming in and out all of the time.

295
00:23:18,423 --> 00:23:21,747
[SPEAKER_21]: So you can send them, or go to their guidance counselor who's doing a lot of the same work that I am.

296
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:23,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you very much.

297
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:24,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

298
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:25,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

299
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:26,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

300
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:39,798
[SPEAKER_07]: It just really speaks to the approach of how we handle students in MedFed, the whole child, because it's not just about getting them through and getting them either off to college or military or to a job.

301
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:45,004
[SPEAKER_07]: But to really seek what they are looking for in their needs and trying to meet those needs.

302
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:51,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really think that having job experience, even if it's not paid,

303
00:23:53,518 --> 00:24:01,639
[SPEAKER_07]: position, it gives you so many life skills that a lot of our young people are lacking and that employers and colleges are looking for.

304
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:22,883
[SPEAKER_07]: They're looking for students that are prepared, that are on time, that, you know, show up when they're supposed to or call if they're sick or, you know, can't answer the phone in a professional manner and all of those skills that you might not get in a day at school but need to move forward and need to present yourself

305
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:27,865
[SPEAKER_07]: not only yourself, your family, but also your community in Meffitt High.

306
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:31,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you move on, people are like, oh, look at that kid from Meffitt High.

307
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:40,950
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a skill that all children need, not only financial skills, but just professionalism and all of those type of things.

308
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,391
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's great that we have this position now at Meffitt High.

309
00:24:44,451 --> 00:24:46,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we struggled for a few years with

310
00:24:47,692 --> 00:25:04,180
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the superintendent's commitment to that department has been great and I'm glad that we're taking a whole child approach at MF&I as well as, you know,

311
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:15,245
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very proud of the work you've done, that it's been acknowledged, and I'm very happy to bring in any dollars you want to bring that benefit our students.

312
00:25:15,365 --> 00:25:17,887
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, you know, and you deserve

313
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:21,234
[SPEAKER_07]: all the recognition that comes along with this.

314
00:25:22,415 --> 00:25:39,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe a note in someone's employee file would be warranted at this time, Mr. Superintendent, that the committee is impressed and appreciates the hard work of both Mrs. Jenkins, did I say it right?

315
00:25:39,724 --> 00:25:41,525
[SPEAKER_07]: I was usually Mrs. Westmark to me.

316
00:25:42,946 --> 00:25:43,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

317
00:25:43,326 --> 00:25:47,448
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. Klein and Mrs. Jensen for your hard work.

318
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:57,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'll put that out there.

319
00:25:57,984 --> 00:25:59,345
[SPEAKER_21]: Is anyone needing employ?

320
00:25:59,405 --> 00:26:01,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyone out here is looking to partner with us.

321
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:02,946
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm all ears.

322
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:05,488
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you very much for all of your support.

323
00:26:05,528 --> 00:26:05,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

324
00:26:05,728 --> 00:26:06,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

325
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:06,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

326
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:11,891
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion on the floor to receive in place on file offered by Miss Cuneo, seconded by Miss Stone.

327
00:26:12,432 --> 00:26:13,212
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

328
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:14,773
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed.

329
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:15,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

330
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:17,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Report.

331
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:17,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

332
00:26:18,135 --> 00:26:19,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on online.

333
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:19,836
[SPEAKER_13]: Be good.

334
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:20,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Academy.

335
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:26,565
[SPEAKER_25]: Good evening.

336
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:40,949
[SPEAKER_25]: On Thursday, September 28th, four eighth grade students from the Andrews Middle School and their teacher, Mr. Chris Tremonti, attended a day-long program on social media for social good.

337
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:53,737
[SPEAKER_25]: Rick Rendon, founder of Empower Peace, asked me if we could gather a group of students together from Medford to participate in launching an innovative use of social media.

338
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:57,100
[SPEAKER_25]: So the following students attended WGBH,

339
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:05,187
[SPEAKER_25]: at this conference, Sophia Zimanski, Andre Perez, Luke Gatti, and Sarah Biannimi.

340
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,852
[SPEAKER_25]: In addition, Mr. Twonte and myself were available for this conference.

341
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:19,902
[SPEAKER_25]: The students listened to John Rendon, President and Executive Officer of the Rendon Group, discuss strategic communications in the 21st century.

342
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:26,289
[SPEAKER_25]: Macon Phillips Skyped from Spain to talk about social media for the social good.

343
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:30,013
[SPEAKER_25]: There were other interactive panelists and discussions.

344
00:27:30,753 --> 00:27:36,400
[SPEAKER_25]: The highlight for many of us was listening to Andrew Frady's Brother of Pete Frady's.

345
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:47,553
[SPEAKER_25]: The discussion about how the Ice Bucket Challenge came about and how social media from people all over the world participated and spread the word.

346
00:27:48,413 --> 00:27:53,736
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Frady said his brother continues his fight in finding a cure for ALS.

347
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:58,118
[SPEAKER_25]: The students told me what they learned from the conference.

348
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:04,161
[SPEAKER_25]: Statements like, what you put online is there forever, even if it's not, even if you take it down.

349
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,602
[SPEAKER_25]: So be careful with what you say.

350
00:28:07,322 --> 00:28:11,203
[SPEAKER_25]: It can hurt you for years later, especially when you're looking for a job.

351
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:15,245
[SPEAKER_25]: And don't always focus on the negative in social media.

352
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:21,615
[SPEAKER_25]: The students are here with us this evening to tell you about what they learned from social media for social good.

353
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:23,556
[SPEAKER_25]: They have an action plan.

354
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:31,440
[SPEAKER_25]: Their issues will focus on communicating with their peers about online fake accounts, bullying, and protecting privacy.

355
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:41,474
[SPEAKER_25]: They will be working with sixth grade students, and I've provided with you in your packet the program for the day and a copy of the agenda and the action plan.

356
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:51,119
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd also like to take a moment to thank Mr. Paul DeLeva, the principal of the school, who helped me put together this group of students, and is also here with us this evening.

357
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,382
[SPEAKER_25]: So at this time, I would like to ask Sarah Bien-Aimé and Andre to come up and discuss what they have learned.

358
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:02,259
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'd like to thank Chris Tremonti as well.

359
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:05,362
[SPEAKER_25]: So Sarah, why don't you come up, and Andre as well.

360
00:29:09,065 --> 00:29:09,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

361
00:29:10,066 --> 00:29:11,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how was your day today?

362
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:12,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

363
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:13,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Was your day great today?

364
00:29:14,598 --> 00:29:14,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it good?

365
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:16,419
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.

366
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So the online for goods group had been an eye opener for us.

367
00:29:21,982 --> 00:29:29,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And it taught my peers and I that it taught my peers and I the uses of the internet and how it affects us in our future.

368
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:35,819
[SPEAKER_05]: not only did it provide background information, but it also provided fun activities to grab the youth's attention.

369
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:49,303
[SPEAKER_05]: And one major thing that really, one major thing that I loved about this group was that you see, you saw several schools, like in the Massachusetts, in the state of Massachusetts come together and try to

370
00:29:50,563 --> 00:29:53,566
[SPEAKER_05]: make a difference, not only in reality, but in online use.

371
00:29:54,486 --> 00:30:05,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And we learned how the ice bucket began, and how it represented ALS, and how the FedEx sign, if you look at it, there's an arrow, which means delivered.

372
00:30:05,656 --> 00:30:07,818
[SPEAKER_05]: That can symbolize the deliverance.

373
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:12,822
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a really great experience for us, personally.

374
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:18,511
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

375
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:23,398
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm Andre Perez from Andrews Middle School, and I'm in the eighth grade.

376
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:28,605
[SPEAKER_20]: And I wrote a short paper on my experience at Online for Good.

377
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:34,177
[SPEAKER_20]: The time I had at Online for Good was very fun and a great learning experience.

378
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:40,423
[SPEAKER_20]: The day started off with being picked up early in the morning and heading to the WGBH building in Boston.

379
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:46,349
[SPEAKER_20]: My friend Luke and I met up with the two other students who were joining us on the trip, Sarah and Sophia.

380
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:51,754
[SPEAKER_20]: The four of us picked a table to sit at and we talked for a little bit and then got right into the lecture.

381
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:56,898
[SPEAKER_20]: The lecture was very good, and we learned a lot about online safety and the power of the internet.

382
00:30:57,418 --> 00:31:00,300
[SPEAKER_20]: One example that was given was the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

383
00:31:05,483 --> 00:31:20,532
[SPEAKER_20]: After the activity was over, Mr. Tremonti and the group decided that we were going to try to pursue an activity where the four students in the group go into a sixth grade room during RTI class and talk to them about what to do and what not to do on the internet and how to stay safe.

384
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:25,995
[SPEAKER_20]: We as a group would like very much to have this activity run through the Andrews Middle School system.

385
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:40,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto, I actually have a question for the students.

386
00:31:41,326 --> 00:31:47,988
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, thank you for going and representing Method so well, and thank you for presenting this evening in such a professional manner.

387
00:31:48,608 --> 00:31:53,590
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very impressed by both your presentations and glad you're Method students.

388
00:31:54,350 --> 00:32:03,478
[SPEAKER_07]: My question to you is, since you've gone there, what different things have you done on your social media since you've gone there?

389
00:32:03,738 --> 00:32:09,042
[SPEAKER_07]: How have you taken what you learned and it changed your everyday life?

390
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:16,248
[SPEAKER_05]: To be careful in what you post on the internet and not to entertain in things that are not appropriate.

391
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've changed how you speak and what you post?

392
00:32:22,988 --> 00:32:41,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Things on the other side of social media, like as she said, the FedEx sign, you look at it carefully and you can see an arrow between the E and the X. Ever since that, I've looked at other things more carefully to see if they have any other symbols inside of them.

393
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:44,227
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

394
00:32:44,568 --> 00:32:50,812
[SPEAKER_07]: And even your contract with your friends and your schoolmates, has it changed how you speak and what you might say?

395
00:32:50,832 --> 00:32:54,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it make you rethink before you hit post?

396
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:56,776
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it helped a lot.

397
00:32:57,617 --> 00:33:05,522
[SPEAKER_20]: Because sometimes you can say stuff that aren't nice, and it gives you a chance to reassure what you're going to say before you send it.

398
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:10,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Also adding to that, it helps us think before we say something.

399
00:33:10,262 --> 00:33:11,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Things before you speak.

400
00:33:11,663 --> 00:33:14,386
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing that also improved.

401
00:33:14,466 --> 00:33:18,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And it helps us not entertain things that are inappropriate.

402
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,471
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a request.

403
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:32,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Since this has seemed to have touched you both, not only would the Andrews kids benefit from your presentation, the McGlenn Middle School would as well.

404
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:39,443
[SPEAKER_07]: And since they don't have representatives going, I'm going to request that you maybe get a chance to

405
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:42,406
[SPEAKER_07]: to present to the sixth graders at the McGlynn as well.

406
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:44,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to ask Ms.

407
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:50,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Caldwell and your principal if they could make that happen, because I want to squirt you over and do that presentation well.

408
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:54,921
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would really love to see students from both schools attend next year.

409
00:33:55,862 --> 00:34:00,724
[SPEAKER_07]: So that we have representatives talking about this, because this is what we hear is a big problem.

410
00:34:01,185 --> 00:34:10,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullying, cyber bullying, cyber issues, they happen at night, but then they come into the school every day.

411
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:12,210
[SPEAKER_07]: And the school's in a very tricky situation.

412
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:23,875
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to set policies and procedures, which we're still working at because things change so quickly.

413
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:31,678
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we have students like you, strong, professional students, talking to other students

414
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:33,879
[SPEAKER_07]: they might hear you, you know?

415
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:41,504
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that your work that you've done and what you've learned is very valuable, and I'd love you to share it to the other building as well.

416
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:48,688
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my first motion on the floor, to make sure that these children get the chance to do that, so I'll need a second.

417
00:34:50,049 --> 00:34:50,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

418
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:58,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And then to make sure that both schools have the opportunity to attend this next year, and we do more of that collaboratively.

419
00:35:00,029 --> 00:35:07,238
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my next motion is to make sure both schools get a chance to partake in this next year.

420
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:09,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So very good.

421
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:10,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

422
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:11,479
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

423
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:11,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuneo.

424
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:13,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

425
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:33,425
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, let me just say that I'm sorry that I didn't get the opportunity to really speak to you about this, because I really wasn't a hundred percent sure before we started the meeting and I sat down with you really quick, but I would have asked you a thousand questions because when I started many years ago, one of the first things that I really wanted to do is it was the anti-bullying.

426
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:36,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we brought in a lot of forums to not only children,

427
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,422
[SPEAKER_15]: and not only our students, but for everybody.

428
00:35:40,242 --> 00:35:45,166
[SPEAKER_15]: I think some people, maybe even adults, might need a refresher course on this.

429
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:51,851
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, trying to tell children all the time, or anyone, just to be careful what you write.

430
00:35:52,252 --> 00:35:53,533
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I get it all the time.

431
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:55,554
[SPEAKER_15]: The Snapchat is only there for a couple of minutes.

432
00:35:55,994 --> 00:36:04,281
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to know from you, what have you learned as far as, like, these sites that they say they're only on there for a couple of minutes, and then they disappear.

433
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:06,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you now had a different,

434
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,513
[SPEAKER_15]: way of thinking about that?

435
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,294
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

436
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:26,586
[SPEAKER_20]: As an example, for Snapchat, things that you think are only there for up to 3 to 10 seconds, people can take screenshots or save them, and they can never go away.

437
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:33,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I am really happy that you have had the opportunity and will have the opportunity to continue with this.

438
00:36:34,128 --> 00:36:40,770
[SPEAKER_15]: As my colleague said, I think this is a wonderful way of really starting to share what you learn.

439
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,191
[SPEAKER_15]: It's important that, you know, your peers hear from you.

440
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:50,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes as adults we'll say it and, you know, oh no, it's not true or you don't know about it or you have no idea about it.

441
00:36:51,553 --> 00:37:06,960
[SPEAKER_15]: I know when we dropped off my son many years ago to college, actually that was one of the biggest things, is students were doing certain things, just fooling around or whatever in college, and then they were going to look for jobs afterwards, and the employers are looking into

442
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:14,766
[SPEAKER_15]: So it has to be something that you really, I hope, will continue bringing to your peers.

443
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:24,035
[SPEAKER_15]: And every opportunity you have, I know your friends are probably going to be tired of listening to you, always saying, no, be careful what you're going to do, but keep on doing it.

444
00:37:25,396 --> 00:37:29,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Even if you just change one person or a couple of people, you've done a lot.

445
00:37:29,238 --> 00:37:29,878
[SPEAKER_15]: You really have.

446
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:35,842
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually, going and learning and educating yourselves, you've already superseded what you needed to do.

447
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:37,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for representing us.

448
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:43,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for absorbing what they're teaching you and actually understanding what they're saying.

449
00:37:44,066 --> 00:37:44,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

450
00:37:44,426 --> 00:37:46,287
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

451
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:53,191
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motions, that this information be shared with the McGlynn Middle School as well, and that the McGlynn participate at the next forum.

452
00:37:54,645 --> 00:37:55,467
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

453
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:55,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

454
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:56,950
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

455
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:57,911
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes.

456
00:37:58,412 --> 00:38:01,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much for contributing this evening.

457
00:38:01,378 --> 00:38:02,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful job.

458
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:02,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

459
00:38:04,322 --> 00:38:07,685
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on Global Scholars Program, Mr. Superintendent.

460
00:38:07,725 --> 00:38:10,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor and members of the committee, this report is in two parts.

461
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:13,909
[SPEAKER_00]: The Global Scholars Program is now in its fourth year.

462
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,874
[SPEAKER_00]: The program is integrated into the seventh grade geography curriculum.

463
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:26,899
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an initiative of the Global Cities Program of Bloomberg Philanthropies out of New York.

464
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford has been a pioneer school system in Massachusetts with this program.

465
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:32,804
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the first to do it.

466
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:37,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the involved cities are large metropolises around the globe.

467
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:41,830
[SPEAKER_00]: There are over 20 major metropolises around the globe participating.

468
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:48,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, we've had the opportunity to help shape the curriculum and methodologies involved in the implementation and development.

469
00:38:49,052 --> 00:38:57,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Curriculum Director, Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli, and our Director of Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chieser, have supervised the outstanding work of our seventh grade middle school teachers.

470
00:38:58,828 --> 00:39:02,472
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, the program will focus on the global food system.

471
00:39:02,532 --> 00:39:10,200
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to allow Dr. Riccadeli to tell you more about it, and then I need to come back and talk about the upcoming symposium that will take place in Paris, France.

472
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:12,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

473
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:21,585
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been here a number of times to talk about the Global Scholars Program, and each time I am excited because, again, it is a wonderful program.

474
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:25,588
[SPEAKER_18]: So just following up on the last presentation, we were talking about social media.

475
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:29,190
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a program that has its own portal.

476
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:31,172
[SPEAKER_18]: It has the Haiku portal system.

477
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:38,057
[SPEAKER_18]: So all of the communication that occurs between our seventh grade students in the program and students around the world

478
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:47,463
[SPEAKER_18]: is protected and the students know ahead of time the teachers can go in and they can look at all of the dialogue that occurs among the students.

479
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:50,285
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want you to know that it is a highly protected system.

480
00:39:51,546 --> 00:39:55,469
[SPEAKER_18]: So as the superintendent mentioned, it includes Medford, so where

481
00:39:56,169 --> 00:39:57,850
[SPEAKER_18]: We're considered Medford, Boston.

482
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:01,253
[SPEAKER_18]: We now have other schools in the area participating.

483
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:06,596
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some Boston public schools, Everett, I think there's one school in Chelsea now.

484
00:40:07,517 --> 00:40:09,958
[SPEAKER_18]: There are a couple of schools in New York and in

485
00:40:11,363 --> 00:40:12,424
[SPEAKER_18]: Jacksonville, Florida.

486
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:20,808
[SPEAKER_18]: So we were the first school here in the United States to participate in this program.

487
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:28,333
[SPEAKER_18]: So not only is it worldwide, but it really not only has it grown worldwide, but it has grown here in the United States as well.

488
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:35,176
[SPEAKER_18]: So as far as the curriculum is concerned this year, the focus is on food and feeding our cities.

489
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,717
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is the yearly curriculum.

490
00:40:37,777 --> 00:40:43,680
[SPEAKER_18]: So it began October 1st, or thereabouts October 1st, and it will end the end of May.

491
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:45,641
[SPEAKER_18]: There are five units.

492
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:56,087
[SPEAKER_18]: So classes, again, all seventh grade students at both the McGlynn and the Andrews have participated in unit one, which is an introduction to the

493
00:40:57,167 --> 00:41:00,890
[SPEAKER_18]: to the program, including introduction to the eClassroom.

494
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,153
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, the responsibilities that come along with that.

495
00:41:05,274 --> 00:41:09,877
[SPEAKER_18]: Unit 2, which we'll be getting shortly, has to do with nourishing ourselves and our cities.

496
00:41:10,478 --> 00:41:17,424
[SPEAKER_18]: So students explore the basic principles of nutrition and investigate the health impact of processed foods and sugar.

497
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:24,509
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll learn how to deal with such issues such as obesity and access to healthy food.

498
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:33,380
[SPEAKER_18]: Moving on to Unit 3, which probably will be towards the beginning of the new calendar year, Growing the Food We Need.

499
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Students will learn of the global system that produces our fruit, vegetables, grains, meat, and seafood.

500
00:41:39,307 --> 00:41:43,512
[SPEAKER_18]: They will consider how climate impacts our ability to grow food.

501
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:51,318
[SPEAKER_18]: Along the way, they'll be doing a lot of writing, a lot of critical thinking, again, a lot of communicating with their partners around the world.

502
00:41:52,319 --> 00:42:00,886
[SPEAKER_18]: As they move on to Unit 4, probably around late February, early March, they will be studying delivering food to the world.

503
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,267
[SPEAKER_18]: That is that unit theme.

504
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:18,245
[SPEAKER_18]: Students will learn how food gets from the farm to their plates through a network of global food supply chains, which I think is a great lesson because many of us don't appreciate how difficult it is for our food to be transported to us.

505
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:31,729
[SPEAKER_18]: And lastly, as is true with all of the curriculum projects in this program, there's an action plan or an action project called Community in Action.

506
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:40,794
[SPEAKER_18]: And students will reflect on what they have learned about nutrition and food security and they will design a project that addresses one of these topics.

507
00:42:42,315 --> 00:42:44,297
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, in a nutshell, that is the curriculum.

508
00:42:44,337 --> 00:42:49,962
[SPEAKER_18]: I certainly do have more information if anyone is interested, but in the interest of time, that's a snapshot.

509
00:42:50,663 --> 00:42:55,528
[SPEAKER_18]: This program has a lot of professional development embedded into it.

510
00:42:56,388 --> 00:43:04,016
[SPEAKER_18]: So the teachers who are involved, at least once a month, are involved with online professional development through a webinar.

511
00:43:05,746 --> 00:43:08,230
[SPEAKER_18]: most of the reviews have been very positive.

512
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:20,146
[SPEAKER_18]: So not only are they getting professional development in pedagogy, but they're also getting professional development in content, which we know our teachers want and need for their relicensure.

513
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:27,088
[SPEAKER_18]: There is a symposium that is occurring in just a few days, really.

514
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:30,110
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it begins on October 22nd.

515
00:43:31,231 --> 00:43:36,634
[SPEAKER_18]: So select district personnel were invited to participate in this project in Paris.

516
00:43:37,174 --> 00:43:38,435
[SPEAKER_18]: So this is really exciting.

517
00:43:38,855 --> 00:43:47,260
[SPEAKER_18]: So the title of the symposium is Students and the Global Edge, Evaluating the Global Digital Educational Experience.

518
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,081
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're really excited.

519
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:58,028
[SPEAKER_18]: Superintendent Belson and one of our seventh grade teachers, Frank Zizzo, who is at the Andrews, will be participating in this symposium.

520
00:43:58,088 --> 00:44:11,537
[SPEAKER_18]: Frank Zizzo has been instrumental in bringing the Skype aspect to these interactions with these other schools around the world, and he has been a model, so he was invited to participate in the program.

521
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:21,478
[SPEAKER_18]: So at this point, I think Superintendent Belson wanted to add something to this, to the symposium part of this presentation.

522
00:44:23,513 --> 00:44:24,814
[SPEAKER_00]: The program is a terrific program.

523
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:37,024
[SPEAKER_00]: It really connects people you saw a little bit with the previous program, people talking to other students, peers around the world, and talking to each other, solving social issues, talking about the kinds of things.

524
00:44:37,504 --> 00:44:44,850
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cutting-edge activity, and there's going to be 50 cities represented in Paris this week.

525
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:47,632
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's going to be incredible exchanges.

526
00:44:47,692 --> 00:44:48,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Bloomberg will keynote.

527
00:44:49,954 --> 00:44:58,100
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be professors from around the world, the London School of Economics, Moscow, Columbia, coming to this symposium to discuss the outcomes.

528
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have some of the materials in the brochure that I've provided to you.

529
00:45:04,357 --> 00:45:13,844
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for me to be compensated under the ethics rules, I need your approval for Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for my expenses to go.

530
00:45:14,444 --> 00:45:23,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I've covered Mr. Zizzo because I'm his appointing authority, you're my appointing authority, so I need your approval for me, but Mr. Zizzo has my approval to attend.

531
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:33,137
[SPEAKER_00]: And we anticipate that this is about a $1,500 expense on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies, the airfare, hotel, and the like.

532
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:45,036
[SPEAKER_00]: I also intend to stay for about a day and a half more, enjoy the city with my wife, and I will pay the expenses for anything associated with my private time in Paris.

533
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:52,340
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look forward to this activity, and I ask your approval to have Bloomberg Philanthropies allow me to attend at their expense.

534
00:45:53,558 --> 00:45:53,818
[SPEAKER_15]: very good.

535
00:45:53,858 --> 00:45:53,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

536
00:45:53,938 --> 00:46:03,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno, before we even do that, I think it's important that we disclose also the program involves participation with the following collaborating cities.

537
00:46:03,482 --> 00:46:06,283
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's really very important.

538
00:46:06,923 --> 00:46:20,249
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to go through them really quickly, but I mean, to hear the cities that I'm going to be talking about and to hear that Medford is part of this is just an incredible achievement, I think, and fortunate

539
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:22,389
[SPEAKER_15]: opportunity for all.

540
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:39,275
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is Taipia, Moscow, New York, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Prague, Tel Aviv, Belize, Warsaw, Manila, Jakarta, Madrid, Delhi, I can't even see it, St.

541
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:45,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Petersburg, Istanbul, Hyderabad, Accra, and Kurskov.

542
00:46:46,257 --> 00:46:49,078
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we're looking and we're hearing at these,

543
00:46:50,298 --> 00:46:51,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it's incredible.

544
00:46:52,439 --> 00:46:56,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so I think it's very important that we have representation.

545
00:46:57,262 --> 00:47:01,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, with that, do I have to make a motion for approval?

546
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:07,448
[SPEAKER_13]: So motion to approve that the superintendent is there a second floor seconded by Ms.

547
00:47:07,508 --> 00:47:08,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Crutz, Mr. Benedetto.

548
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I, I was just wondering, um,

549
00:47:17,183 --> 00:47:20,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we the only Massachusetts school attending this conference?

550
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:26,069
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a representative from Boston, and there's a representative from the Everett Public Schools.

551
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:32,174
[SPEAKER_00]: We introduced the program to Boston and Everett at the request of Marjorie Bloomberg-Tiven.

552
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:38,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it typical for a superintendent to go as well as a teacher?

553
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:39,579
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

554
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just checking.

555
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just asking a question.

556
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:41,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.

557
00:47:41,881 --> 00:47:44,383
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, obviously, they're looking for educational leaders.

558
00:47:45,004 --> 00:47:49,626
[SPEAKER_00]: to discuss the impact of outcomes on these kinds of programs.

559
00:47:51,147 --> 00:47:52,487
[SPEAKER_07]: I think my colleague has a question.

560
00:47:53,308 --> 00:47:53,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

561
00:47:53,548 --> 00:47:56,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Quinn, must don't.

562
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:56,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

563
00:47:56,929 --> 00:48:00,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Riccadeli, so Mr. Zizzo was the point person for the Andrews.

564
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:03,312
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a point person at the McGlennan where they invited as well?

565
00:48:05,147 --> 00:48:05,348
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

566
00:48:05,808 --> 00:48:09,331
[SPEAKER_18]: There were, to my knowledge, three people invited.

567
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:10,773
[SPEAKER_18]: I was invited.

568
00:48:10,793 --> 00:48:12,134
[SPEAKER_18]: I declined the invitation.

569
00:48:13,795 --> 00:48:16,958
[SPEAKER_18]: They did not select four schools.

570
00:48:17,539 --> 00:48:20,982
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Zizzo was selected because of his contribution.

571
00:48:22,163 --> 00:48:30,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Outside of his regular duties, he introduced the entire program to how Skype could be used in it.

572
00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:34,112
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's how he differentiated himself from the rest.

573
00:48:34,452 --> 00:48:35,893
[SPEAKER_18]: The other teachers are fantastic.

574
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,974
[SPEAKER_18]: They do a great job.

575
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:42,938
[SPEAKER_18]: the other teacher, there's several teachers involved, at the Andrews and the McGlynn.

576
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:47,921
[SPEAKER_18]: But again, what set him apart was his contribution with the Skype.

577
00:48:48,442 --> 00:48:51,444
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's four seventh grade global scholars, right?

578
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:53,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Two at each middle school, A and B side?

579
00:48:53,565 --> 00:48:54,186
[SPEAKER_17]: That's correct.

580
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:59,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So should that be something we should think about, that to let a McGlynn

581
00:49:01,844 --> 00:49:06,248
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an invitation on the part of Bloomberg Philanthropies.

582
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:14,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Marjorie Tiven, who is the executive of this particular program, selected Mr. Zizzo for his contributions.

583
00:49:15,236 --> 00:49:23,164
[SPEAKER_00]: All the young people, all of our teachers did a good job doing things, but Mr. Zizzo added some technological capacity, advanced the concept a little bit.

584
00:49:23,204 --> 00:49:26,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we were the first school system in Massachusetts to do this.

585
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:30,793
[SPEAKER_00]: they were looking at us for ideas.

586
00:49:31,453 --> 00:49:35,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided them with some positions, papers on project-based learning and other things like that.

587
00:49:35,775 --> 00:49:42,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Zizza was selected for his contributions as opposed to being in a school, a particular school.

588
00:49:42,058 --> 00:49:58,165
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are teachers and administrators and professors and business people from all walks going to this particular thing to have this symposium to trade ideas about how we can leverage international digital learning.

589
00:49:58,768 --> 00:50:00,128
[SPEAKER_00]: and create some outcomes that are there.

590
00:50:00,168 --> 00:50:02,289
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a selection of the program.

591
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:04,690
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, I think Mr. Zizzo is great.

592
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:06,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Tegan has him this year for seventh grade.

593
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:13,192
[SPEAKER_17]: So then is Mr. Zizzo, does he come back and teach the rest of the three seventh grade teachers about the Skyping tool?

594
00:50:13,712 --> 00:50:25,436
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's already done that, but he'll come back and as I will too, and also meet with people to talk about the things that were discussed and how it can be advanced and where we can grow from it and what other people have suggested.

595
00:50:26,642 --> 00:50:31,327
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really an attempt to exchange ideas and bring back advancements to the program.

596
00:50:31,687 --> 00:50:33,168
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, remember, it's only in its fourth year.

597
00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:41,596
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you might imagine with the revenues or the resources behind Bloomberg Philanthropies, it can grow substantially.

598
00:50:42,257 --> 00:50:51,406
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, you know, bring back some ideas and these are things that we'll try to do and try to advance and try to do even more than we're doing now, incorporate even more people.

599
00:50:56,941 --> 00:51:00,502
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say that the way I've read this was that it wasn't invitational.

600
00:51:01,162 --> 00:51:08,505
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the people that were selected for this were selected from the Bloomberg, not from our city.

601
00:51:08,645 --> 00:51:14,528
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said also, I'm hoping that when the superintendent and Mr. Zizek go,

602
00:51:15,308 --> 00:51:29,793
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, if discussion comes up as far as what will be done in the future, maybe they could open it up even to maybe asking for students that actually participate in the program to be part of the type of symposium that they're doing.

603
00:51:31,034 --> 00:51:32,794
[SPEAKER_15]: As you said, it's only been four years.

604
00:51:32,814 --> 00:51:41,838
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that you've gone to any of the other symposium, and I don't think that they've had anything going on, that Mr. Azuz will go before, not to Europe.

605
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:57,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Zizzo actually participated in a teleconference that was earlier in the year, and his contributions were such that they felt that they needed to be shared in a more, let's say, complete setting.

606
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:09,372
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to ask though really quickly, I know we've said it in the past, when do our students really have the opportunity to Skype because of other countries being at different times and stuff?

607
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:10,093
[SPEAKER_15]: How has that worked?

608
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,816
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not easy, it's a very good question.

609
00:52:12,856 --> 00:52:15,199
[SPEAKER_18]: There are some cities around the world we are

610
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:19,131
[SPEAKER_18]: who we are not able to Skype with because of the time difference.

611
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:27,092
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have heard stories of schools around the country actually coming back at 6 o'clock at night so that they can Skype with our students.

612
00:52:27,872 --> 00:52:34,833
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's kind of taken off on a whole new life of its own in other countries, and they get excited to do it.

613
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:35,373
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

614
00:52:35,393 --> 00:52:39,554
[SPEAKER_18]: Have our students done that too, just go back to school to accommodate the time frame?

615
00:52:39,974 --> 00:52:40,974
[SPEAKER_18]: Not to my knowledge, no.

616
00:52:41,154 --> 00:52:41,234
OK.

617
00:52:41,254 --> 00:52:43,135
[SPEAKER_18]: Not to my knowledge.

618
00:52:43,195 --> 00:52:43,855
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I just want to?

619
00:52:45,689 --> 00:52:52,014
[SPEAKER_18]: just so everyone hears, the selection of Mr. Zizzo was done by Bloomberg Philanthropies.

620
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:58,299
[SPEAKER_18]: It had nothing to do with Medford Public Schools, and I think that is important to make very clear.

621
00:52:58,699 --> 00:53:01,982
[SPEAKER_18]: They selected him, they selected Superintendent Belson.

622
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:02,983
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what I figured.

623
00:53:03,023 --> 00:53:04,624
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, thank you.

624
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:11,810
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting things I just shared with you, and I think it's fascinating, is that virtually everybody from everywhere else speaks English.

625
00:53:13,344 --> 00:53:18,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, we don't typically speak all the languages that we'll be communicating with.

626
00:53:19,418 --> 00:53:21,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting.

627
00:53:21,159 --> 00:53:28,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of our groups, we had some Greek students who were able to speak to the students in Athens in Greek last year.

628
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:38,648
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few other examples are where some of our students who come from other countries or non-native language speakers were able to communicate in the language to the communities they were at.

629
00:53:38,708 --> 00:53:44,412
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's more likely that the communication will be in English, and our students will

630
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:50,700
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to speak their own language as opposed to a language that belongs to another country.

631
00:53:51,785 --> 00:53:53,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good, Mr. Benedetto, follow up you.

632
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:58,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm very glad that you're going, Mr. Superintendent, for a few reasons.

633
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:06,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, I've seen you represent us very well in very official capacities, and I know you'll represent us well.

634
00:54:07,188 --> 00:54:16,509
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that you will take every opportunity to talk to Mr. Bloomberg and bring him and his money back to Medford where he started and where his money belongs.

635
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:19,230
[SPEAKER_07]: And so make sure you

636
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:32,471
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you one quick cute story, which I'm not sure I should, but I will anyway, is that several years ago when he was running for mayor,

637
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:42,190
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our assistant principals, submasters at the time, made a serious mistake and released this transcript from Medford High School.

638
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:46,854
[SPEAKER_00]: And it showed up in the Boston Herald and the gossip pages.

639
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:49,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out that he got a D in French.

640
00:54:49,757 --> 00:54:53,221
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions I won't ask him when I'll see him is, how's your French?

641
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,022
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

642
00:54:56,083 --> 00:54:57,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Tringali.

643
00:54:57,848 --> 00:55:03,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I was wondering in what ways are students allowed to communicate with each other, like student to student?

644
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,131
[SPEAKER_18]: So they text each other.

645
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:08,391
[SPEAKER_18]: So they have a common lesson.

646
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:12,152
[SPEAKER_18]: So all of the lessons are formed well in advance.

647
00:55:13,592 --> 00:55:15,693
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, again, on that Haiku portal.

648
00:55:16,153 --> 00:55:19,974
[SPEAKER_18]: So they have prompts, they have questions about a lesson.

649
00:55:20,014 --> 00:55:21,935
[SPEAKER_18]: So in this case, it will be a lesson about food.

650
00:55:23,495 --> 00:55:33,750
[SPEAKER_18]: So they're responding, so students are asked to critique, in a pleasant way, to critique the writing of the fellow students on the other side of the world.

651
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:38,177
[SPEAKER_18]: And a lot of times there's a conversation that develops about

652
00:55:38,657 --> 00:55:45,383
[SPEAKER_18]: I can imagine conversations about, this is what we eat here, and we have farms here.

653
00:55:45,423 --> 00:55:58,714
[SPEAKER_18]: It starts off as a very defined conversation, but oftentimes it evolves into, what would a 10 to 13-year-old want to talk about with regard to the content area?

654
00:55:59,235 --> 00:56:05,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, it's defined and it's prescriptive, but there's a little wiggle room for the kids to express their personality.

655
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:09,346
[SPEAKER_18]: all in a protected environment.

656
00:56:10,027 --> 00:56:19,742
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to approve the Bloomberg Philanthropies to pay for Mr. Superintendent's expenses, there's already a motion for approval by Ms.

657
00:56:19,762 --> 00:56:20,063
[SPEAKER_13]: Gugge.

658
00:56:32,945 --> 00:56:36,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, one absent.

659
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:36,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

660
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:37,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

661
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:38,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

662
00:56:41,353 --> 00:56:46,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up, recommendation to accept the Buddy Bench donation.

663
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:50,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll call upon our assistant superintendent to tell you about the Buddy Bench donation.

664
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:56,891
[SPEAKER_25]: So as you know, we have buddy benches in all of our elementary schools, and we're very proud of that.

665
00:56:57,551 --> 00:57:02,175
[SPEAKER_25]: But Mr. Mark Tonello is donating a buddy bench to the Brooks Elementary School.

666
00:57:02,215 --> 00:57:07,098
[SPEAKER_25]: This will be an indoor buddy bench, in memory of his uncle, Victor Lepore.

667
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:11,421
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Lepore taught English and reading for 30 years in Medford.

668
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:17,506
[SPEAKER_25]: In his early years, he taught at the Dean's School and then at the Hobbs Junior High School.

669
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:22,390
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm very proud to say that school committee member Robert Emmett Skerry, Jr.

670
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:26,733
[SPEAKER_25]: constructed this bench for the Tonello-DePaolo family.

671
00:57:26,753 --> 00:57:28,655
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you very much, Mr. Skerry.

672
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:37,221
[SPEAKER_25]: There will be a dedication taking place on Friday, October 20 at the Brooks Elementary School at 4 o'clock, and you're all invited.

673
00:57:41,215 --> 00:57:41,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

674
00:57:41,415 --> 00:57:48,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuneo, could we make sure as a committee that we send a letter of gratitude to Mr. Mark Tonello, please, and his family?

675
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,321
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. Skerry?

676
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:51,942
[SPEAKER_15]: We're saying thank you to him.

677
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:54,104
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll save some paper and we'll say thank you in person.

678
00:57:54,184 --> 00:57:56,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor for approval?

679
00:57:56,746 --> 00:57:56,786
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

680
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuneo?

681
00:57:57,386 --> 00:57:57,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion.

682
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:00,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

683
00:58:00,929 --> 00:58:01,589
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please.

684
00:58:05,472 --> 00:58:05,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

685
00:58:18,354 --> 00:58:18,614
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

686
00:58:18,654 --> 00:58:23,177
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I'm standing here.

687
00:58:23,578 --> 00:58:26,900
[SPEAKER_25]: So I have to say this is one of my favorite times of the year.

688
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:39,790
[SPEAKER_25]: Although it happens at the end of the school year in June, I am so very proud and we should all be very happy that we have Kiwanians in our community that give back to our schools on a regular basis.

689
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:48,126
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'd once again like to thank the Kiwanis Club of Medford for their generous donation of books to our first and third grade children.

690
00:58:48,686 --> 00:58:53,107
[SPEAKER_25]: The Kiwanis Club has always gone above and beyond for the children of Medford.

691
00:58:53,667 --> 00:59:00,969
[SPEAKER_25]: So in June, members of the Kiwanis Club visited each of our schools and gave each child a bag filled with books for summer reading.

692
00:59:01,529 --> 00:59:04,490
[SPEAKER_25]: So I know I've said this before, but you have to see the students.

693
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:05,910
[SPEAKER_25]: They get their books and we say,

694
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:09,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Now, don't open your books until you get back to the classroom.

695
00:59:09,451 --> 00:59:11,672
[SPEAKER_25]: The word's even out of our mouths.

696
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:17,615
[SPEAKER_25]: The kids have opened the books, they're looking at them, and they're trading already, which is very, very exciting.

697
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:21,316
[SPEAKER_25]: So once again, I have some Kewaneean members here.

698
00:59:21,416 --> 00:59:31,301
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd like to call, if they can all come to the podium, Kelly Catalo, Andrea Bates-McGrath, Rick Harvey-Yellow, and Chuck Veneziano.

699
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:34,442
[SPEAKER_25]: You have to be there to watch this happen.

700
00:59:34,482 --> 00:59:36,482
[SPEAKER_25]: Chuck does this song and dance with the kids.

701
00:59:36,762 --> 00:59:38,023
[SPEAKER_25]: He's so entertaining.

702
00:59:38,863 --> 00:59:43,924
[SPEAKER_25]: But if you don't mind, if I could read some of these letters, because they are priceless.

703
00:59:44,444 --> 00:59:49,646
[SPEAKER_25]: So our teachers obviously have the kids write letters to thank the Kiwanis.

704
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,126
[SPEAKER_25]: These happen to come from Miss McKay's room.

705
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:53,927
[SPEAKER_25]: She always gets these out right away.

706
00:59:54,867 --> 00:59:56,228
[SPEAKER_25]: Dear Kiwanis, we love you.

707
00:59:56,248 --> 00:59:59,110
[SPEAKER_25]: We love that you spend your free time with us.

708
00:59:59,690 --> 01:00:01,871
[SPEAKER_25]: I will be sad that I won't get to see you anymore.

709
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:03,192
[SPEAKER_25]: She must be a third grader.

710
01:00:03,873 --> 01:00:07,395
[SPEAKER_25]: But we'll always cherish you in my heart and in the books.

711
01:00:08,035 --> 01:00:09,516
[SPEAKER_25]: By the way, I wrote a book myself.

712
01:00:09,936 --> 01:00:13,278
[SPEAKER_25]: It's called Zoe in the Class School Bus Adventures.

713
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:19,002
[SPEAKER_25]: And just after that inspirational speech, I finally know what book to write.

714
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:19,702
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

715
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:20,903
[SPEAKER_25]: Love, Regina.

716
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:25,250
[SPEAKER_25]: A second letter of only read three.

717
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,330
[SPEAKER_25]: There could be a lot here.

718
01:00:27,131 --> 01:00:30,333
[SPEAKER_25]: Dear Kiwanis members, thanks so much for the books.

719
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:32,955
[SPEAKER_25]: Thanks for spending your free time with us.

720
01:00:33,475 --> 01:00:35,617
[SPEAKER_25]: When we get in the classroom, we get to trade.

721
01:00:36,317 --> 01:00:39,920
[SPEAKER_25]: I got rid of Skateboard Party, apparently didn't like that one.

722
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,702
[SPEAKER_25]: Where did you get those awesome books?

723
01:00:42,882 --> 01:00:46,384
[SPEAKER_25]: You're the best book givers in the whole universe.

724
01:00:47,245 --> 01:00:48,266
[SPEAKER_25]: This was from Sarah.

725
01:00:49,408 --> 01:00:52,278
[SPEAKER_25]: And the last one is one of my very favorites.

726
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:53,382
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, you see it.

727
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:54,525
[SPEAKER_25]: It's all in caps.

728
01:00:56,070 --> 01:01:00,372
[SPEAKER_25]: Dear Kiwanis members, I'm very grateful for the books you gave me and my friends.

729
01:01:00,852 --> 01:01:04,514
[SPEAKER_25]: You guys are very, caps, bold, helpful.

730
01:01:05,154 --> 01:01:06,915
[SPEAKER_25]: You are also very inspiring.

731
01:01:07,435 --> 01:01:10,036
[SPEAKER_25]: You show people to have hope when they're down.

732
01:01:10,496 --> 01:01:13,818
[SPEAKER_25]: You help people with moving soft drinks and bills.

733
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:18,540
[SPEAKER_25]: You're a caring group of people who want to make the world a better place.

734
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,561
[SPEAKER_25]: If you keep doing what you're doing, the Kiwanis might go worldwide.

735
01:01:25,686 --> 01:01:27,748
[SPEAKER_25]: Should we tell her you're already worldwide?

736
01:01:29,149 --> 01:01:32,592
[SPEAKER_25]: You help people know that they're safe when they're around you.

737
01:01:33,332 --> 01:01:36,795
[SPEAKER_25]: Medford is a better place to live in it with you guys here.

738
01:01:37,435 --> 01:01:38,556
[SPEAKER_25]: Sincerely, Jaden.

739
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:39,117
[SPEAKER_25]: P.S.

740
01:01:39,857 --> 01:01:45,402
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm going to ask my mom if she can post a video picture of me reading one of your books.

741
01:01:45,722 --> 01:01:53,709
[SPEAKER_25]: So on behalf of Medford Public Schools, grades one and three, all of our teachers and staff and families, thank you so much.

742
01:01:59,473 --> 01:02:06,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It is actually our honor and privilege to contribute to the Children of Medford, because that's what Kiwanis is all about.

743
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:11,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all about serving the children of the world, and our job is to serve the children of Medford.

744
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:15,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not just a literacy program that we hold dear to our heart.

745
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:17,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our scholarship program.

746
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:25,456
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our contributing to the graduation ceremony at Curtis Tufts, providing a scholarship to a Curtis Tufts student.

747
01:02:26,136 --> 01:02:29,898
[SPEAKER_08]: It's giving to Medford High School athletics, Medford High School band.

748
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:36,160
[SPEAKER_08]: This year we picked up the culinary arts program and provided new aprons and jackets to them.

749
01:02:37,781 --> 01:02:42,865
[SPEAKER_08]: More than half of our fundraising budget goes to the children of Medford.

750
01:02:43,686 --> 01:02:44,627
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are committed.

751
01:02:45,287 --> 01:02:45,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

752
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:56,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad that my fellow Pawneans, our current president, Chucky Veneziano, Rich Carvello, as all of you know, is our past president.

753
01:02:56,977 --> 01:03:01,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Kelly Catalo will be the president next year, and my presidency just ended.

754
01:03:01,721 --> 01:03:02,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

755
01:03:08,435 --> 01:03:09,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Madam Mayor.

756
01:03:09,936 --> 01:03:17,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, we had the honor of welcoming a man who was a student from Italy from 1983.

757
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:22,603
[SPEAKER_01]: And he stayed with a Kiwanian family, a John Sotranos family.

758
01:03:23,124 --> 01:03:29,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sotranos and the Frakes stayed friendly for all these years to the kids or anything.

759
01:03:29,868 --> 01:03:31,789
[SPEAKER_01]: And tonight, he was our guest at the Kiwanis.

760
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is the mayor of St.

761
01:03:35,031 --> 01:03:37,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Ambrose in Italy.

762
01:03:37,741 --> 01:03:39,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were proud to have him there tonight.

763
01:03:40,742 --> 01:03:43,664
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, the family just keeps growing.

764
01:03:43,844 --> 01:03:44,684
[SPEAKER_13]: What a nice story.

765
01:03:45,244 --> 01:03:50,247
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to witness firsthand the event at the Roberts and it is an event.

766
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:58,530
[SPEAKER_13]: I got to tell you, I was quite surprised, but the kids were so elated to see you all come in and just to hear the stories and Kelly's enthusiasm.

767
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,391
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a fabulous afternoon.

768
01:04:00,491 --> 01:04:01,992
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for letting me share with you.

769
01:04:02,112 --> 01:04:06,834
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you to the city of Medford for helping us put on jail day 5k and shutting down the streets so we could do that.

770
01:04:13,913 --> 01:04:14,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

771
01:04:14,953 --> 01:04:19,355
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion that this report be placed on file, second by Mr. Benedetto.

772
01:04:19,395 --> 01:04:20,095
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

773
01:04:20,835 --> 01:04:21,435
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

774
01:04:21,595 --> 01:04:22,256
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

775
01:04:25,417 --> 01:04:28,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we send a thank you letter to the Quantians as well?

776
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:32,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on Professional Development Day, November 7, 2017.

777
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:32,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

778
01:04:32,999 --> 01:04:33,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Caldwell.

779
01:04:38,168 --> 01:04:42,951
[SPEAKER_25]: So as most of you know, our professional development day is coming up on November 7th.

780
01:04:43,392 --> 01:04:45,673
[SPEAKER_25]: It'll be our first of two days.

781
01:04:46,434 --> 01:04:50,277
[SPEAKER_25]: The elementary staff will be meeting at the McGlynn Elementary School.

782
01:04:50,817 --> 01:04:54,099
[SPEAKER_25]: And of course, we've asked them to park at Hormel because it's voting day.

783
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:55,480
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't want that to interfere.

784
01:04:56,621 --> 01:05:01,930
[SPEAKER_25]: And they will be participating in grade level workshops on response to intervention.

785
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:10,944
[SPEAKER_25]: You may remember this was one of the district initiatives that you wanted to see us do and our teachers want to be trained in.

786
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:24,554
[SPEAKER_25]: Teachers 21 is a consulting firm from Newton, Mass., who will work with our staff to build a shared understanding of RTI fundamentals and help us consider our next steps.

787
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:26,995
[SPEAKER_25]: Staff will understand the structures,

788
01:05:27,495 --> 01:05:32,837
[SPEAKER_25]: processes, and instructional practices needed for successful implementation of RTI.

789
01:05:33,397 --> 01:05:42,581
[SPEAKER_25]: In addition, staff will work collaboratively, self-assess current capacities, and plan for the next step for implementation of RTI.

790
01:05:43,822 --> 01:05:49,644
[SPEAKER_25]: The middle schools will participate in Study Island as a universal screening behavioral intervention tool.

791
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:58,067
[SPEAKER_25]: Teachers will learn to utilize study island questions and develop a fall winter screener exam for grades six, seven, and eight.

792
01:05:58,848 --> 01:06:08,916
[SPEAKER_25]: Administrators and teachers will review behavioral interventions and develop their own pyramid to determine what is considered tier one, tier two, and tier three.

793
01:06:09,676 --> 01:06:13,760
[SPEAKER_25]: The Andrews and the McGlynn Middle School will meet at Medford High School.

794
01:06:14,761 --> 01:06:32,016
[SPEAKER_25]: Medford High Vocational School and the Curtis Tufts staff will participate in workshops regarding specific building-based data collection in focus group discussions and identify topics from their ongoing partnerships with Harvard University and Boston College.

795
01:06:32,937 --> 01:06:46,343
[SPEAKER_25]: Paraprofessionals in Medford will collaborate with each other on online curriculum in three research-based modules, Independence, Positive Behavior Supports, and Effective Communication.

796
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:54,346
[SPEAKER_25]: The Fine Arts Department will focus on teaching pathways through the music curriculum, as well as concepts in art education.

797
01:06:55,147 --> 01:06:58,068
[SPEAKER_25]: Nurses, physical education, and health education staff

798
01:06:58,548 --> 01:07:00,649
[SPEAKER_25]: will participate in safety care training.

799
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:04,750
[SPEAKER_25]: There are many other groups of specialists involved.

800
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:10,931
[SPEAKER_25]: There are guidance people and psychologists that we're just getting information on them.

801
01:07:10,951 --> 01:07:12,772
[SPEAKER_25]: I just couldn't put them all down at one time.

802
01:07:13,732 --> 01:07:19,894
[SPEAKER_25]: So after Professional Development Day, we will provide you with a report letting you know how we made out on that day.

803
01:07:20,694 --> 01:07:21,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

804
01:07:22,094 --> 01:07:22,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

805
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:23,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

806
01:07:24,075 --> 01:07:24,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the report.

807
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:29,353
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a question about the RTI fundamentals.

808
01:07:29,453 --> 01:07:35,899
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we were considering adding additional help last year at budget time, so I just want to make sure.

809
01:07:35,919 --> 01:07:41,405
[SPEAKER_07]: At that time, we identified additional staff members that may be helping with the RTI.

810
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:44,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Will they be helping with this training?

811
01:07:44,287 --> 01:07:49,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we, you know, I don't know exactly what staff members, off the top of my head,

812
01:07:50,053 --> 01:08:01,160
[SPEAKER_07]: we identified as helping out with RTI, but I just want to make sure that if we are providing any training and insight to make that program better, that all staff members are invited, not just the regular teachers.

813
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,041
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's not just the classroom teachers.

814
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:10,166
[SPEAKER_25]: We have Title I, we have literacy specialists, we have special education teachers, we have our EL staff.

815
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:15,910
[SPEAKER_25]: Most of our elementary staff will be participating in this RTI.

816
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:22,876
[SPEAKER_25]: It will be grade level, so it will be K1 teachers with one consultant, two, three, and then four or five.

817
01:08:23,356 --> 01:08:34,587
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're all learning this together so that when they have their RTI block that everyone jumps in and helps the students to progress.

818
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:39,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says here, help us consider our next steps.

819
01:08:40,114 --> 01:08:44,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you provide us with a report of what those steps are?

820
01:08:44,817 --> 01:08:49,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we want to keep track of this this year in case it becomes a budget issue for next year.

821
01:08:49,882 --> 01:08:50,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

822
01:08:50,662 --> 01:08:50,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

823
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:51,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

824
01:08:51,803 --> 01:08:55,186
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll put that on my requested reports.

825
01:08:56,507 --> 01:09:01,270
[SPEAKER_25]: So we're beginning the pilot in January with first grades and with fourth grades.

826
01:09:01,991 --> 01:09:08,875
[SPEAKER_25]: And we'll probably know by the end of May how that's working out and then how we can roll that out to K to 5.

827
01:09:09,076 --> 01:09:10,176
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

828
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:18,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just really want to make sure, because teachers spoke about how important RTI is in making those changes.

829
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:25,126
[SPEAKER_07]: So before budget times and if we're going to allocate additional funding, I want some data.

830
01:09:26,508 --> 01:09:27,929
[SPEAKER_07]: and updates throughout this year.

831
01:09:27,969 --> 01:09:33,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe in January we can have an update of how it's going and what it's looking like.

832
01:09:33,415 --> 01:09:42,706
[SPEAKER_07]: So by March, when the superintendent's thinking where I'm allocating funds for next year, if we do see any concerns, he can keep it on his radar.

833
01:09:42,906 --> 01:09:45,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm keeping it on mine, Mr. Belson.

834
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:52,156
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would think that by the end of January or February, because we're just beginning January, we need about four to six weeks to get it started.

835
01:09:52,176 --> 01:09:54,378
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'll put by February 1st on my paperwork.

836
01:09:54,418 --> 01:09:59,824
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion that reports do be listed for RTI next steps, we add it to our agenda.

837
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:01,285
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

838
01:10:01,325 --> 01:10:01,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

839
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:02,667
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

840
01:10:02,947 --> 01:10:03,427
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

841
01:10:07,635 --> 01:10:16,463
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a request that you had made for a report at our last meeting that I didn't notice on our... There's one on there that you can walk to.

842
01:10:16,483 --> 01:10:16,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

843
01:10:17,164 --> 01:10:17,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

844
01:10:18,185 --> 01:10:22,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just didn't know if this was an appropriate time to make a comment for that.

845
01:10:22,108 --> 01:10:22,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

846
01:10:22,328 --> 01:10:22,789
[SPEAKER_07]: That okay?

847
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:26,873
[SPEAKER_07]: You had asked for a breakdown of the male-female concussion report.

848
01:10:28,273 --> 01:10:33,396
[SPEAKER_07]: at our last meeting, and I didn't see that report on the list of requested reports, so.

849
01:10:34,156 --> 01:10:36,598
[SPEAKER_13]: Male, female concussion reports by sport.

850
01:10:37,338 --> 01:10:46,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and also just to keep in mind that we asked that non-athletic concussions be followed if we're notified at that same meeting.

851
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:53,486
[SPEAKER_07]: So just as a reminder that that data is important for all students, not just our athletic students.

852
01:10:55,973 --> 01:10:56,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

853
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:58,736
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion, this report be placed on file.

854
01:10:58,796 --> 01:10:59,497
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

855
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:00,839
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

856
01:11:01,099 --> 01:11:01,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

857
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:02,461
[SPEAKER_13]: Report is on file.

858
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:06,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on elementary science program school year 17-18.

859
01:11:07,006 --> 01:11:07,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Seary.

860
01:11:10,363 --> 01:11:25,585
[SPEAKER_25]: So this evening, Rocco Sieri, Director of Science, will update you on the efforts to realign the science and technology engineering curriculum, as well as the variety of science programs that are being piloted in our elementary schools.

861
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:41,914
[SPEAKER_25]: The following topics will be discussed, information on science programs, professional development and materials, surveying staff, administrators, and parents on said programs, professional development for current school year, and additional resources.

862
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:47,637
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just want to take a moment to thank Mr. Cieri for his very hard work in science.

863
01:11:49,938 --> 01:12:01,324
[SPEAKER_25]: He spent a lot of time working with not just our elementary staff, but parents who wanted to be a part of looking at what we might pilot next year.

864
01:12:01,764 --> 01:12:02,905
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you, Mr. Sierra.

865
01:12:19,052 --> 01:12:19,913
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, everyone.

866
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:22,275
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks for having me here tonight.

867
01:12:22,335 --> 01:12:28,322
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm pretty excited to be speaking about K-5 science rather than high school science, middle school science.

868
01:12:28,342 --> 01:12:33,247
[SPEAKER_23]: We're finally here looking at K-5 science programs.

869
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:40,094
[SPEAKER_23]: The report you have in front of you sort of highlights a little bit of what we've accomplished since last year.

870
01:12:41,515 --> 01:12:57,939
[SPEAKER_23]: Starting in April 6th through the end of May, we invited vendors in with their most current science programs and had teachers review them, look at the materials that they provided, a whole series of things, let them do presentations.

871
01:12:58,419 --> 01:13:00,380
[SPEAKER_23]: Parents were there, administrators were there.

872
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:08,143
[SPEAKER_23]: Myself and 24 teachers from all there were representatives from every elementary school at every level.

873
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:15,605
[SPEAKER_23]: So it was a very sort of cohesive group that showed up on a regular basis after school.

874
01:13:16,886 --> 01:13:22,888
[SPEAKER_23]: Some chocolate and snacks were provided as often as I could put them in place, but they were always there.

875
01:13:23,868 --> 01:13:28,270
[SPEAKER_23]: And it was a really very productive group.

876
01:13:29,433 --> 01:13:54,267
[SPEAKER_23]: So we looked at five programs, Know Adam, Inspire Science from McGraw-Hill, Elevate Science from Pearson, Carolina Science presented a program called Smithsonian Science in the Classroom, and Delta Education, which is also a part of school specialty, these are all companies, showed us FOSS Next Generation.

877
01:13:55,733 --> 01:14:10,205
[SPEAKER_23]: The teachers filled in at the end of each presentation a survey, and then they filled in a survey at the end where they provided sort of like, now that you've seen all the programs, which ones would you, you know, want to pilot?

878
01:14:10,826 --> 01:14:13,028
[SPEAKER_23]: And three sort of emerged out of those.

879
01:14:14,189 --> 01:14:18,212
[SPEAKER_23]: The top by far was the McGraw-Hill Inspire Science Program.

880
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,555
[SPEAKER_23]: The second two were essentially tied.

881
01:14:23,452 --> 01:14:29,074
[SPEAKER_23]: the Pearson Elevate Science Program, and the Delta Education FOSS Next Generation Program.

882
01:14:29,934 --> 01:14:38,577
[SPEAKER_23]: And I inquired further with those three companies about what was possible for the pilot, what they would provide for us as you had requested last year.

883
01:14:39,277 --> 01:14:52,581
[SPEAKER_23]: McGraw-Hill agreed to pilot with full access to the curriculum online, gave hard copies of the teacher guides for two teachers per grade level, all the student consumable workbooks that we need for all the students,

884
01:14:54,001 --> 01:14:57,203
[SPEAKER_23]: And the small group hands-on group activity kits.

885
01:14:57,904 --> 01:15:01,445
[SPEAKER_23]: So per teacher, it's about $1,600 worth of materials.

886
01:15:01,786 --> 01:15:09,510
[SPEAKER_23]: They provided the training, which is ongoing, and we have 48 teachers this year going through that particular program.

887
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:18,096
[SPEAKER_23]: A second company I pursued a bit was Pearson, asking them what they could do.

888
01:15:19,117 --> 01:15:28,905
[SPEAKER_23]: They would allow us to pilot with full access to the curriculum online and hard copies of teacher guides, but their pilot was to start in January of this upcoming year.

889
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:34,214
[SPEAKER_23]: They also weren't going to provide hands-on kits because they would never be available in time.

890
01:15:34,294 --> 01:15:35,496
[SPEAKER_23]: Their program is brand new.

891
01:15:36,057 --> 01:15:40,405
[SPEAKER_23]: And the teachers had limited access to see what the table of contents of those programs were.

892
01:15:42,813 --> 01:15:48,576
[SPEAKER_23]: So with all of that kind of information, we're kind of waiting to see what Pearson provides.

893
01:15:48,656 --> 01:15:56,780
[SPEAKER_23]: And they said they were interested in providing at least a bid if in the future there was something to do, something to look at.

894
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:04,844
[SPEAKER_23]: We could also look forward and say, okay, well, maybe we'll pilot in a future year with that particular program.

895
01:16:07,802 --> 01:16:10,686
[SPEAKER_23]: just allowed us to pilot one unit.

896
01:16:12,028 --> 01:16:14,632
[SPEAKER_23]: It would include the materials, the professional development.

897
01:16:16,014 --> 01:16:21,963
[SPEAKER_23]: One unit for them is about 12 weeks worth of instruction, 12 to 14 weeks of instruction, so it's a fairly large

898
01:16:23,104 --> 01:16:33,787
[SPEAKER_23]: SWATH, and they only give you about three units per year, so we're piloting about a third of their curriculum for the next 12 to 14 weeks.

899
01:16:34,267 --> 01:16:44,590
[SPEAKER_23]: That training will start at the end of this month, will continue into the next month, and we have eight teachers piloting that from K to four, and they will be trained as well.

900
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:55,155
[SPEAKER_23]: It sounds like a much smaller pilot, but we can still sort of give them some superdelegates as they provide us information about what FOSS is like and how the implementation goes.

901
01:16:55,275 --> 01:17:04,180
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm not sort of concerned about the number difference as much as I am the quality of the information that we get back from them as we make decisions moving forward.

902
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,943
[SPEAKER_23]: So those are the pilots that are ongoing at this time.

903
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:16,612
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to make sure I have like a bullet list and making sure that I touch everything rather than give you a summary, just read through.

904
01:17:19,655 --> 01:17:25,380
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, so I mentioned McGraw-Hill, Foss.

905
01:17:28,256 --> 01:17:52,909
[SPEAKER_23]: We should be prepared to consider adoption at the end of this year, looking at the two programs that would sort of will bring back that information to the school committee to make a decision about which direction to go and whether or not there's enough information for us as educators to make a good, solid decision.

906
01:17:55,684 --> 01:18:00,655
[SPEAKER_23]: As I said, we've got another opportunity that was provided.

907
01:18:00,715 --> 01:18:01,978
[SPEAKER_23]: It's at the end of the report.

908
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:15,765
[SPEAKER_23]: I still see a bit of a need to help elementary educators understand the engineering design process and engineering thinking.

909
01:18:16,165 --> 01:18:23,468
[SPEAKER_23]: This is part of the curriculum frameworks, but it's not something that most elementary educators are trained in.

910
01:18:24,068 --> 01:18:29,370
[SPEAKER_23]: Generally, a trained engineer will work in engineering and not go to K to 5 education.

911
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:33,312
[SPEAKER_23]: So there is some support for us.

912
01:18:34,232 --> 01:18:44,660
[SPEAKER_23]: in being able to train teachers using the Engineering is Elementary program, which is produced by the Museum of Science in Boston.

913
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,023
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a phenomenal, well-research-based program.

914
01:18:49,283 --> 01:18:54,828
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether or not we choose to purchase that program for our teachers is something outside of the

915
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:03,507
[SPEAKER_23]: the discussion, it's really about what the training would give to the teachers in terms of how to understand engineering design.

916
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:15,398
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's available to us for March 12th, and we plan to offer that as one of the PD's opportunities for the teachers at no cost.

917
01:19:15,478 --> 01:19:16,979
[SPEAKER_23]: It won't cost us anything.

918
01:19:18,961 --> 01:19:19,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Skerry.

919
01:19:20,181 --> 01:19:33,125
[SPEAKER_10]: Through you to Mr. Skerry, would it be possible to supply us with some of the samples that you've been given so that we can see what we could possibly look at down the road as far as instrumenting a new program?

920
01:19:33,785 --> 01:19:34,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

921
01:19:35,285 --> 01:19:35,565
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

922
01:19:35,585 --> 01:19:36,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

923
01:19:37,266 --> 01:19:37,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

924
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:37,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuneo.

925
01:19:38,646 --> 01:19:40,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Skerry.

926
01:19:41,087 --> 01:19:43,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you tell me what type of feedback you've received?

927
01:19:43,847 --> 01:19:45,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Have any of the teachers been involved in

928
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:52,525
[SPEAKER_23]: So, as I said, there are 48 teachers currently piloting.

929
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:57,209
[SPEAKER_23]: They've received all the kits, the teacher materials, teacher guides.

930
01:19:57,670 --> 01:20:04,857
[SPEAKER_23]: They were initially trained at the end of September, so they've gone through one training that sort of gives them an overview of the program.

931
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,940
[SPEAKER_23]: We're training again in October at the end of the month.

932
01:20:11,102 --> 01:20:12,583
[SPEAKER_23]: The feedback's been really positive.

933
01:20:13,424 --> 01:20:15,025
[SPEAKER_23]: It's very aligned to the curriculum.

934
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:33,637
[SPEAKER_23]: And teachers were really, when they expressed through last year's pilot that they wanted a full year or sort of uninterrupted time of using a program, I honored that and didn't

935
01:20:34,518 --> 01:20:38,008
[SPEAKER_23]: try to find one that was a half measure along that.

936
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:40,073
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, the

937
01:20:41,947 --> 01:20:50,370
[SPEAKER_23]: They requested that, especially at the K-2 level, that the materials were sort of hands-on.

938
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:59,154
[SPEAKER_23]: The initial sort of program explanation is a lot of the workbook-based or the teacher guides.

939
01:21:00,395 --> 01:21:07,978
[SPEAKER_23]: And so they were concerned that it wasn't a hands-on program, at least from McGraw-Hill.

940
01:21:08,938 --> 01:21:11,621
[SPEAKER_23]: I thought they've shown something very different.

941
01:21:12,562 --> 01:21:14,584
[SPEAKER_23]: Every grade level has hands-on kits.

942
01:21:15,025 --> 01:21:17,227
[SPEAKER_23]: The workbook is supposed to be like a notebook.

943
01:21:17,287 --> 01:21:22,613
[SPEAKER_23]: It is scaffolded, but it's really sort of like a science notebook that students use and write in.

944
01:21:22,773 --> 01:21:25,216
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's a pretty interesting program.

945
01:21:29,892 --> 01:21:32,274
[SPEAKER_15]: even across the board.

946
01:21:32,675 --> 01:21:36,078
[SPEAKER_23]: It's two per grade level, per school.

947
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:42,444
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's essentially half the faculty across the board.

948
01:21:43,285 --> 01:21:45,066
[SPEAKER_23]: And most of the kids, believe it or not.

949
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:51,112
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, because some schools have three teachers or have one teaching science.

950
01:21:51,132 --> 01:21:53,434
[SPEAKER_23]: So it captures all of the kids in some grades.

951
01:21:59,592 --> 01:22:00,953
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, the kids really like it.

952
01:22:02,434 --> 01:22:05,277
[SPEAKER_23]: Some of them are saying that it's finally science time.

953
01:22:05,357 --> 01:22:07,318
[SPEAKER_23]: They're getting excited, they're moving ahead.

954
01:22:08,439 --> 01:22:12,202
[SPEAKER_23]: We're getting requests for other materials and things like that, so it's been positive.

955
01:22:12,522 --> 01:22:14,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Any feedback from parents?

956
01:22:15,064 --> 01:22:15,364
[SPEAKER_23]: Not yet.

957
01:22:16,045 --> 01:22:17,006
[SPEAKER_23]: Looking forward to it, though.

958
01:22:18,362 --> 01:22:18,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Curious.

959
01:22:19,122 --> 01:22:19,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

960
01:22:19,883 --> 01:22:20,023
[SPEAKER_17]: Nostal.

961
01:22:20,083 --> 01:22:21,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

962
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:22,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Mrs. Seary.

963
01:22:22,564 --> 01:22:26,346
[SPEAKER_17]: For the FOSS one with the eight teachers at the Brooks, that hasn't started yet?

964
01:22:26,606 --> 01:22:27,546
[SPEAKER_23]: That has not started.

965
01:22:28,126 --> 01:22:32,468
[SPEAKER_23]: We want to train first, provide kits, and then the teachers can start.

966
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:33,008
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

967
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:42,713
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the other that just caught my attention, because I know it's been a while that we've been waiting to pilot, the Inspire Science Program was adopted this year by Stoneham Public Schools of the K through 5.

968
01:22:42,773 --> 01:22:44,513
[SPEAKER_17]: So they didn't pilot programs.

969
01:22:44,533 --> 01:22:47,555
[SPEAKER_17]: They just went with it and started this past September.

970
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:49,169
[SPEAKER_23]: They did.

971
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:51,251
[SPEAKER_23]: So.

972
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:53,752
[SPEAKER_17]: And are they having any regrets?

973
01:22:53,772 --> 01:22:54,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have a contact there?

974
01:22:54,993 --> 01:22:56,454
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know, but I can find out.

975
01:22:56,794 --> 01:22:57,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

976
01:22:57,414 --> 01:22:57,634
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

977
01:22:58,195 --> 01:23:01,657
[SPEAKER_17]: They kind of threw the dice and bought a whole curriculum for a whole school system.

978
01:23:02,037 --> 01:23:04,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

979
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:06,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to receive and place this on file?

980
01:23:07,821 --> 01:23:09,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Ms.

981
01:23:09,342 --> 01:23:09,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuno.

982
01:23:09,822 --> 01:23:10,562
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

983
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:11,103
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

984
01:23:11,263 --> 01:23:11,943
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

985
01:23:12,283 --> 01:23:12,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

986
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:20,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on vocational technical advisory committee schedule.

987
01:23:21,754 --> 01:23:28,681
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier this evening, an individual came up and complained about the vocational advisory committees.

988
01:23:30,363 --> 01:23:36,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Chapter 74 programs require us to have advisory committees.

989
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:38,672
[SPEAKER_00]: They've existed over the years.

990
01:23:39,495 --> 01:23:47,880
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the advent of Dr. Riccio, they became much more pronounced and much more involved, and many more people were involved.

991
01:23:49,521 --> 01:24:08,331
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to meet a minimum of two times per year, and the committee members serve as resources, the school administration, the various shop instructors, and they're composed of a wide variety of expertise and experience categories include business owners, managers, technicians, university instructors, engineers, teachers, students, and parents.

992
01:24:09,384 --> 01:24:13,345
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also very helpful in finding co-op learning opportunities for our students.

993
01:24:15,766 --> 01:24:25,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I've attached a public notice of the two meetings that will be held this year, and that's already posted so that there's no problem this year about the meeting being posted.

994
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:36,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year it was posted on the vocational website, but that did not meet the state requirement that it be posted at the city clerk and on our own website.

995
01:24:37,660 --> 01:24:46,798
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're in violation, but this attorney general, and you can see I gave you a copy of that earlier in the front end, indicated just don't do it again.

996
01:24:47,579 --> 01:24:47,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

997
01:24:48,784 --> 01:24:53,207
[SPEAKER_00]: I've listed the number of members of each of these advisory committees.

998
01:24:53,228 --> 01:24:55,429
[SPEAKER_00]: That number can go up and down depending on who's available.

999
01:24:56,390 --> 01:25:03,676
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also given you a listing of some of the co-op locations that our young people go to.

1000
01:25:03,836 --> 01:25:05,977
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in time, it's still very early in the year.

1001
01:25:06,918 --> 01:25:10,381
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be more as we get into the late fall.

1002
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:15,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also given you a listing of the various members of the various

1003
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:19,978
[SPEAKER_00]: advisory committees to see who's actually involved at this point in time.

1004
01:25:20,039 --> 01:25:23,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, these people can change, they can come and go.

1005
01:25:24,042 --> 01:25:31,049
[SPEAKER_00]: But we feel that there's a great representation and we think that the co-op program is a tremendous asset to our vocational program.

1006
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:38,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it gives young people some real world experience in their senior year, in some cases their junior year.

1007
01:25:41,343 --> 01:25:54,392
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be sure that our current administration at the vocational school uses them to learn about various things that are developing in the trades and the technical areas, and we get good feedback.

1008
01:25:54,952 --> 01:25:58,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very pleased with what's taken place with our advisory committee.

1009
01:25:58,515 --> 01:26:01,757
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 16 different working groups, although there are 20 curriculum areas.

1010
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:06,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them combined because of the affinity for each other, they're really crossover areas.

1011
01:26:07,995 --> 01:26:22,928
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to take any questions you may have, but I think you have sufficient information to get an idea that we have posted the advisory committee meetings two times for this year, and we've also provided you with information about who's on them and what they do.

1012
01:26:24,549 --> 01:26:24,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1013
01:26:24,729 --> 01:26:25,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuno.

1014
01:26:26,851 --> 01:26:28,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm looking at the co-op employers.

1015
01:26:29,193 --> 01:26:34,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that the employers that are involved in providing the co-ops to our students?

1016
01:26:34,338 --> 01:26:35,499
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have students right now.

1017
01:26:36,342 --> 01:26:39,583
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have students in their businesses right now.

1018
01:26:39,883 --> 01:26:44,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, because there's a couple that don't have anything, so I was just wondering, like construction doesn't have anything?

1019
01:26:44,504 --> 01:26:47,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, well, construction, most of it is done through the laborers.

1020
01:26:47,264 --> 01:26:47,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1021
01:26:47,704 --> 01:26:52,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got activities over there, so it isn't really mostly a business activity, it's mostly with the laborers.

1022
01:26:52,605 --> 01:26:54,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, what about business, tech, and marketing?

1023
01:26:54,986 --> 01:26:55,346
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry?

1024
01:26:55,506 --> 01:26:56,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Business, tech, and marketing?

1025
01:26:57,226 --> 01:27:01,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you right now, except the fact that I know that Joe is working on filling all these areas.

1026
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and the same thing with the graphic arts?

1027
01:27:04,862 --> 01:27:05,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and the media?

1028
01:27:06,643 --> 01:27:09,404
[SPEAKER_15]: Media tech, I'm assuming, will be utilizing our media?

1029
01:27:09,985 --> 01:27:10,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily.

1030
01:27:10,785 --> 01:27:12,086
[SPEAKER_15]: It could be internships and co-ops.

1031
01:27:12,106 --> 01:27:13,006
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be outside.

1032
01:27:13,046 --> 01:27:14,968
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be expansions of this.

1033
01:27:15,028 --> 01:27:16,268
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very early in the year for this.

1034
01:27:16,529 --> 01:27:16,749
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1035
01:27:17,429 --> 01:27:18,090
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, thank you.

1036
01:27:19,991 --> 01:27:20,151

1038
01:27:20,771 --> 01:27:27,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, when we do get the next report, could we get a breakdown of how many students are in the co-op at each program?

1039
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:27,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.

1040
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:30,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just curious about that also, thank you.

1041

1060
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:13,512
[SPEAKER_07]: I just realized that there was another report on the reports requested list missing.

1061

1062
01:28:18,456 --> 01:28:26,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we tabled this so that people could have an opportunity to look it over to determine whether or not they could attend this conference.

1063
01:28:26,923 --> 01:28:31,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any members that would like to be nominated as a delegate or an alternate?

1064
01:28:49,994 --> 01:28:52,976
[SPEAKER_15]: or not, but to really try to get to the conference.

1065
01:28:54,037 --> 01:29:06,845
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of beneficial things that go on, not only to network with other members throughout the state of Massachusetts, but also it's really a huge learning experience.

1066
01:29:07,745 --> 01:29:08,686
[SPEAKER_15]: There are vendors there.

1067
01:29:08,726 --> 01:29:10,347
[SPEAKER_15]: There are opportunities on workshops.

1068
01:29:10,787 --> 01:29:15,809

1069
01:29:17,570 --> 01:29:28,875
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there's a lot of talk sometimes that people think it's, you know, a particular person who's trying to do certain rules and regulations or it's a particular city that tries to do that.

1070
01:29:28,995 --> 01:29:31,296
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot more involved than that.

1071
01:29:31,376 --> 01:29:34,218
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of rules and regulations that come through the state.

01:29:49,167 --> 01:29:50,448
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying we don't know them.

1075
01:29:50,608 --> 01:29:52,529
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just saying it's always good to learn more.

1076

01:32:28,349 --> 01:32:31,854
[SPEAKER_07]: For the next meeting, I can read the email that I received.

1108
01:32:32,155 --> 01:32:34,978
[SPEAKER_13]: That's okay, we can add it to the reports list and Christine can put it together.

1109
01:32:34,999 --> 01:32:37,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Christine can comment on that because we've done some work on that.

1110
01:32:37,222 --> 01:32:39,505
[SPEAKER_00]: We can give you a quick idea and then we'll give you a formal report.

1111
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:55,199
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been monitoring the activity for the bus from the high school, and there has generally been between 40 and 45 students that are routinely taking the bus.

1112
01:32:55,239 --> 01:33:02,322
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have not seen the overcrowding since we have been monitoring that on a pretty much daily basis.

1113
01:33:02,362 --> 01:33:08,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So there has been representation out there at the bus and making sure that the overcrowding is not taking place.

1114
01:33:09,025 --> 01:33:12,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have adjusted for some of that on other routes as well.

1115
01:33:12,952 --> 01:33:13,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good, thank you.

1116
01:33:13,873 --> 01:33:17,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you still, do you still like a written report?

1117
01:33:18,295 --> 01:33:31,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I would, and I, I, just because it's different from what I had gotten from an email, and also I would like to know how many passes are given out for that bus, because I, I heard that they have IDs to get on and off that bus at this point.

1118
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:35,145
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a new implementation that we have done to

1119
01:33:35,905 --> 01:33:43,668
[SPEAKER_03]: monitor the usage of the bus and ensure that there are not overcrowding for the students that are actually intended to ride that bus.

1120
01:33:44,068 --> 01:33:48,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So the bus passes are being monitored as well.

1121
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:52,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will confirm the count with the headmaster.

1122
01:33:52,911 --> 01:34:04,875
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, because the email that I have in front of me, it says we currently have 104 eligible students that live in North Medford Heights area that have rode the bus at some point over the past three weeks.

1123
01:34:05,544 --> 01:34:10,688
[SPEAKER_07]: eligible in that they issued bus passage to eligible students.

1124
01:34:11,469 --> 01:34:18,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I, there are days that are a couple of open seats and other days we are over capacity by a few students.

1125
01:34:18,035 --> 01:34:26,061
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to make sure nobody's over capacity driving and riding in any of our buses, especially the high school kids.

1126
01:34:26,121 --> 01:34:27,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Their backpacks are huge.

1127
01:34:27,883 --> 01:34:28,784
[SPEAKER_07]: The kids are bigger.

1128
01:34:29,264 --> 01:34:30,325
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only two to a seat.

1129
01:34:30,809 --> 01:34:32,330
[SPEAKER_07]: realistically not three.

1130
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:38,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would just like some data or like on Mondays, this is what happens.

1131
01:34:38,091 --> 01:34:39,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And on Fridays, this is what happens.

1132
01:34:39,692 --> 01:34:41,052
[SPEAKER_07]: And Wednesdays it goes crazy.

1133
01:34:41,072 --> 01:34:42,573
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it rains, it's impossible.

1134
01:34:43,093 --> 01:34:47,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know so that way we are transporting our students, you know, safely.

1135
01:34:47,394 --> 01:34:49,195
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and that's all that matters.

1136
01:34:49,295 --> 01:34:52,756
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would like a report of that in that, in that way.

1137
01:34:53,236 --> 01:34:56,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's on the reports do list.

1138
01:34:57,077 --> 01:34:59,618
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like that soon because we are, you know,

1139
01:35:00,358 --> 01:35:06,101
[SPEAKER_07]: halfway through October, and we need to make sure all our children are transported safely.

1140
01:35:06,121 --> 01:35:07,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hate to have something happen.

1141
01:35:07,822 --> 01:35:17,007
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, just as a follow-up, we do work very closely with the bus company to ensure that safety is the number one issue for all of our buses.

1142
01:35:17,108 --> 01:35:26,653
[SPEAKER_03]: So that has been a priority, especially with the high school, given the size of the seats and the reduced counts that are available.

1143
01:35:27,093 --> 01:35:30,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the eligible count does not mean that they're all riding.

1144
01:35:30,135 --> 01:35:34,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have many MBTA bus passes that we issue as well.

1145
01:35:34,919 --> 01:35:40,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So on a given day, there is not 100 students that are trying to get onto the yellow bus.

1146
01:35:40,523 --> 01:35:44,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, that's why I'd like the numbers if you can provide them.

1147
01:35:44,106 --> 01:35:44,866
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

1148
01:35:45,447 --> 01:35:45,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1149
01:35:46,147 --> 01:35:46,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1150
01:35:46,628 --> 01:35:47,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1151
01:35:47,068 --> 01:35:49,330
[SPEAKER_13]: This motion for suspension of the rules.

1152
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:50,270
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1153
01:35:50,751 --> 01:35:51,431
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1154
01:35:52,132 --> 01:35:52,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1155
01:35:52,492 --> 01:35:53,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Stone would like to discuss

1156
01:36:11,302 --> 01:36:14,866
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if we can subcontract.

1157
01:36:36,661 --> 01:36:37,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1158
01:36:38,082 --> 01:36:44,165
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a late resignation just before the start of the school year, and we have been actively looking for a replacement.

1159
01:36:44,225 --> 01:36:48,187
[SPEAKER_16]: We've been interviewing individuals to replace that position.

1160
01:36:48,767 --> 01:36:57,212
[SPEAKER_16]: In the meantime, we do have two other BCBAs and two other behavioral specialists in the school district, and the responsibilities have been evenly divided.

1161
01:36:57,252 --> 01:37:05,797
[SPEAKER_16]: So all IEP services and all evaluations are on target and all being done in compliance with regulations.

1162
01:37:06,757 --> 01:37:14,383
[SPEAKER_16]: There haven't been, to the best of my knowledge, there are no students who have gone without any service that is to be provided by a BCBA.

1163
01:37:14,403 --> 01:37:31,255
[SPEAKER_16]: I do realize that school teams oftentimes depend on people when a disruption occurs in the moment, but we are well staffed with school psychologists, school adjustment counselors, and other support staff who are equipped to be able to manage those situations.

1164
01:37:31,695 --> 01:37:34,097
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm unclear of the roles of everyone, but

1165
01:37:34,774 --> 01:37:39,457
[SPEAKER_17]: In the McGlynn, they said the Adjustment Counselor is doing some of what a behaviorist would do.

1166
01:37:39,557 --> 01:37:42,519
[SPEAKER_17]: So is the Adjustment Counselor the same schooling as a behaviorist?

1167
01:37:42,539 --> 01:37:45,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so a BCBA is an analyst.

1168
01:37:46,241 --> 01:37:46,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1169
01:37:46,461 --> 01:37:51,164
[SPEAKER_16]: So their role is not necessarily to do the direct hands-on work with the student.

1170
01:37:51,584 --> 01:37:54,966
[SPEAKER_16]: It's to respond to situations.

1171
01:37:55,873 --> 01:38:06,444
[SPEAKER_16]: after they've gone through a school adjustment counselor, school psychologist, and other members of the team to analyze the situation, to look at it from a behavioral perspective, and to design intervention plans.

1172
01:38:06,844 --> 01:38:17,194
[SPEAKER_16]: The intervention plans then get carried out by, say, a school psychologist or a school adjustment counselor, maybe teachers, paraprofessionals, other members of the school team.

1173
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:24,929
[SPEAKER_16]: the school adjustment counselor should be the person who's on the ground working with students directly.

1174
01:38:25,389 --> 01:38:28,775
[SPEAKER_17]: And is there a shortage of behaviorists in our area?

1175
01:38:28,795 --> 01:38:32,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think there's a growing, there's a growing

1176
01:38:35,788 --> 01:38:38,450
[SPEAKER_16]: presence of BCBAs in the school setting.

1177
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:46,815
[SPEAKER_16]: So in past years, I mean, as you know, here in Medford, I mean, we didn't have three BCBAs until two years ago.

1178
01:38:47,355 --> 01:38:49,796
[SPEAKER_16]: So we added a BCBA two years ago.

1179
01:38:49,876 --> 01:38:52,078
[SPEAKER_16]: We added the second BCBA

1180
01:38:53,442 --> 01:38:58,904
[SPEAKER_16]: maybe four years ago, and prior to that we had one, and if you went back 10 years ago, we didn't have any.

1181
01:38:59,464 --> 01:39:04,765
[SPEAKER_16]: So BCBAs, they look at things from an analytical perspective.

1182
01:39:04,945 --> 01:39:12,367
[SPEAKER_16]: They break down a behavior to identify the cause and recommend interventions to mitigate that need.

1183
01:39:12,827 --> 01:39:15,008
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's just that schools are seeing

1184
01:39:15,663 --> 01:39:21,969
[SPEAKER_16]: with an increase of individuals with social behavioral presentation, they're seeing a greater need.

1185
01:39:22,029 --> 01:39:31,498
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yes, schools are hiring BCBAs, so that creates a shortage, but we are doing what we can to hire qualified staff to replace that position.

1186
01:39:31,698 --> 01:39:35,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Is our salary comparable to areas around us for our behaviorists?

1187
01:39:36,909 --> 01:39:39,091
[SPEAKER_17]: And have you had any leads, or is it some?

1188
01:39:39,111 --> 01:39:46,638
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we've been interviewing, and it's just we haven't identified a person who could fit our needs, what we're looking for in a BCBA.

1189
01:39:47,835 --> 01:39:54,258
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the meantime, you're confident that kids are all getting their services met, that we don't need a subcontractor for behaviors?

1190
01:39:54,318 --> 01:40:01,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody has reported that there are any students with IEP services to me that have not been provided for.

1191
01:40:01,741 --> 01:40:06,283
[SPEAKER_16]: And the evaluation load, like I said, has been redistributed.

1192
01:40:06,603 --> 01:40:13,966
[SPEAKER_16]: And all of the evals, we've been monitoring the evaluations, and they have been coming back on time within the required timeline.

1193
01:40:14,246 --> 01:40:16,727
[SPEAKER_17]: So the three that we have, one's full time at the Roberts.

1194
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:19,714
[SPEAKER_17]: One shared between the Andrews and the Columbus?

1195
01:40:19,834 --> 01:40:21,216
[SPEAKER_16]: They're all district-wide staff.

1196
01:40:21,656 --> 01:40:23,819
[SPEAKER_16]: So we place staff where we need those staff.

1197
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:30,248
[SPEAKER_16]: So right now we have a large need for BCBA services at the Roberts.

1198
01:40:31,998 --> 01:40:40,000
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Corman's home base is at the Roberts, but he can provide services to other students around the district as needed.

1199
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:50,364
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we have another individual who has their office over at the Columbus, because that's a high-needs building, but also provides BCBA services across the district.

1200
01:40:51,024 --> 01:41:00,907
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the individual who had left primarily had an office over at the McGlynn, so that's why they're feeling the loss, because if your office is in a building,

1201
01:41:01,537 --> 01:41:08,671
[SPEAKER_16]: You're easier to obtain contact with and come to somebody's aid in an immediate way.

1202
01:41:08,991 --> 01:41:10,654
[SPEAKER_16]: And then where's the third one's office?

1203
01:41:11,516 --> 01:41:13,480
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Island Buckley's up at the high school.

1204
01:41:14,841 --> 01:41:20,124
[SPEAKER_17]: So then has the one that's housed at the Columbus or the one that's housed at the Roberts gone to the McGlynn?

1205
01:41:21,045 --> 01:41:22,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't know specifically.

1206
01:41:23,326 --> 01:41:33,213
[SPEAKER_16]: What we did was we sat down and said, these are the evaluations that need to be conducted, and these are the students with direct services oversight, and those children are covered.

1207
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:41,750
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so what I'm, just so we're all on the same page, what I'm hearing is that the one at the Roberts is at the Roberts, doesn't go anywhere else.

1208
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:44,491
[SPEAKER_17]: The one at the Andrews and the Columbus only goes to the Andrews and the Columbus.

1209
01:41:45,011 --> 01:41:45,991
[SPEAKER_17]: There must be one at the high school.

1210
01:41:46,011 --> 01:41:47,672
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't know anything about that one.

1211
01:41:48,112 --> 01:41:56,854
[SPEAKER_17]: So that the McGlynn doesn't have a behaviorist, that the person, the kid's IEPs, what they're asking, the adjustment counselor is doing what typically the behaviorist would be doing.

1212
01:41:57,274 --> 01:41:58,995
[SPEAKER_17]: If the behaviorist was, I was still building.

1213
01:41:59,515 --> 01:41:59,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so.

1214
01:42:00,735 --> 01:42:13,949
[SPEAKER_16]: In the world of BCBAs, students who typically have a BCBA service on their IEP are typically children with autism who have ABA discrete trial programming or oversight from the BCBA.

1215
01:42:14,730 --> 01:42:20,756
[SPEAKER_16]: So the populations of students who have those needs are primarily located in those buildings that you just mentioned.

1216
01:42:21,016 --> 01:42:22,778
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there are some students

1217
01:42:23,519 --> 01:42:34,944
[SPEAKER_16]: from different disability categories in buildings such as the McGlynn Elementary School, but they don't have the level of direct service that you would see on some other students' plans.

1218
01:42:35,024 --> 01:42:38,065
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, I don't want to get into comparing all the children.

1219
01:42:38,125 --> 01:42:39,906
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't either, but I just want to make sure.

1220
01:42:39,926 --> 01:42:45,288
[SPEAKER_16]: But I can assure you that we've looked into this, and I think I explained this to you in an email.

1221
01:42:45,548 --> 01:42:46,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I have.

1222
01:42:47,269 --> 01:42:48,389
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't know how we can help.

1223
01:42:48,489 --> 01:42:52,111
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's been a few months since the person left, and I'm just wondering,

1224
01:42:52,652 --> 01:42:55,673
[SPEAKER_17]: What can we do to attract people here better?

1225
01:42:57,554 --> 01:42:57,934
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1226
01:42:58,494 --> 01:43:01,915
[SPEAKER_16]: We put laced ads on School Spring.

1227
01:43:01,955 --> 01:43:04,977
[SPEAKER_16]: We have ads on the website.

1228
01:43:05,257 --> 01:43:09,018
[SPEAKER_16]: And ads have gone out to the other venues that we typically put ads out to.

1229
01:43:09,458 --> 01:43:10,539
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had some bites.

1230
01:43:10,919 --> 01:43:19,062
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just a very unfortunate time of year to require a key staff person where you don't have hundreds of people applying for these jobs.

1231
01:43:19,702 --> 01:43:20,923
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had maybe six.

1232
01:43:22,044 --> 01:43:26,928
[SPEAKER_16]: We thought we had somebody who didn't work out, and we have another interview tomorrow with somebody.

1233
01:43:26,948 --> 01:43:31,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Another individual, we called him for an interview, and they just got snagged by Malden.

1234
01:43:31,412 --> 01:43:35,696
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're not the only community who's out there looking for these professionals.

1235
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:39,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1236
01:43:39,319 --> 01:43:56,966
[SPEAKER_15]: Cuneo, just for a clarification, the ones that you just went through, do they have the ability, if they're assigned to those particular schools and they have offices in those particular schools, does that mean that they can't leave those schools to go to a school that doesn't have one at this moment?

1237
01:43:57,186 --> 01:44:02,269
[SPEAKER_16]: No, they absolutely can go to the other schools as the need arises, and that's what they've been doing.

1238
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:05,051
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the clarification I needed to have.

1239
01:44:05,991 --> 01:44:07,492
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are down at the McGlynn.

1240
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:12,175
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been down since what we've had in the past, correct?

1241
01:44:12,636 --> 01:44:14,457
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're looking for someone for the McGlynn.

1242
01:44:15,653 --> 01:44:26,539
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, so the person who was assigned to the McGlynn was assigned to the McGlynn Elementary, McGlynn Middle, some students at the high school, out of district, some out of district students, the Brooks.

1243
01:44:27,059 --> 01:44:31,921
[SPEAKER_16]: So it depends on what their area of expertise are.

1244
01:44:32,322 --> 01:44:37,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Because some BCBAs are ABA discrete trial specialists.

1245
01:44:37,764 --> 01:44:42,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Other people might have their strength in the area of social emotional dysregulation.

1246
01:44:42,807 --> 01:44:47,811
[SPEAKER_16]: So we try to match up people with what they do best.

1247
01:44:48,191 --> 01:44:57,317
[SPEAKER_15]: But the person that you're looking for is to replace the person from where the school office was located, which was at the moment.

1248
01:44:57,337 --> 01:44:58,999
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, right now that's where there is a hole.

1249
01:44:59,079 --> 01:45:07,785
[SPEAKER_16]: But if the person who we hire ultimately has a different skill set, we might need to do some moving around so that we make sure that people are aware.

1250
01:45:10,002 --> 01:45:11,642
[SPEAKER_16]: where they need to be to support the students.

1251
01:45:12,302 --> 01:45:15,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Because that's the most important thing for us is supporting the students.

1252
01:45:15,663 --> 01:45:29,586
[SPEAKER_15]: So at this point, then you are saying that the last two months that we haven't had that particular person, the counselors from the other schools or the BCB from the other schools have been going to accommodate the other students that needed that.

1253
01:45:29,706 --> 01:45:39,668
[SPEAKER_16]: If there is an evaluation, if that need arises, of course, we've covered what we need to do to cover to make sure that IEPs and our evaluation timelines have been completed.

1254
01:45:41,589 --> 01:45:44,931
[SPEAKER_16]: within regulations.

1255
01:45:45,471 --> 01:45:45,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1256
01:45:45,952 --> 01:45:46,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1257
01:45:46,332 --> 01:45:46,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1258
01:45:46,712 --> 01:45:47,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1259
01:45:47,913 --> 01:45:48,874
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have one item.

1260
01:45:49,694 --> 01:45:49,874
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1261
01:45:49,934 --> 01:45:56,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Nelson would like to explain something about our upcoming committee of the whole meeting regarding the new MCAS.

1262
01:46:01,261 --> 01:46:01,962
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

1263
01:46:03,163 --> 01:46:05,364
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, this is MCAS season again.

1264
01:46:05,384 --> 01:46:08,226
[SPEAKER_24]: And once again, we have a very,

1265
01:46:09,255 --> 01:46:12,457
[SPEAKER_24]: short time frame to get things ready for everyone.

1266
01:46:12,477 --> 01:46:17,761
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, this morning the results were made known to the administrators.

1267
01:46:18,141 --> 01:46:24,666
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, they have been working very diligently all day trying to put the figures together.

1268
01:46:24,686 --> 01:46:33,792
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, the department of elementary and secondary education has provided us with information related to the release, the public release.

1269
01:46:34,493 --> 01:46:37,295
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, um, we have the results today.

1270
01:46:38,022 --> 01:46:41,985
[SPEAKER_24]: The public release is scheduled for Wednesday, October 18th.

1271
01:46:42,765 --> 01:46:51,791
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, we are planning that individual student scores will be mailed home when they're sent to the superintendent's office around October 24th.

1272
01:46:53,452 --> 01:46:55,894
[SPEAKER_24]: As all of you know, in the spring of 2017,

1273
01:46:58,003 --> 01:47:03,647
[SPEAKER_24]: all students in grades three through eight were administered the Next Generation MCAS.

1274
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:10,272
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a new version of the 20-year-old MCAS, which is now known as the Legacy MCAS.

1275
01:47:10,632 --> 01:47:25,883
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're really working with two different assessments, one which is grades three through eight, which is the new generation, and then the high school is still, and the science exams, five, eight, and the high school science, are still with the older version of MCAS.

1276
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:38,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, that legacy MCAS was administered in grade 10, students in English language arts and mathematics, and all students taking the science exams.

1277
01:47:40,497 --> 01:47:51,921
[SPEAKER_24]: On Thursday, October 12, DESE held a webinar containing information related to 2017 MCAS accountability ratings and student score reporting.

1278
01:47:52,801 --> 01:47:55,622
[SPEAKER_24]: We've attached the PowerPoint from that webinar

1279
01:47:56,260 --> 01:48:04,566
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, we plan to report specifics of our scores on Wednesday evening.

1280
01:48:04,646 --> 01:48:07,908
[SPEAKER_24]: We're planning a meeting at 6.30 is it?

1281
01:48:08,128 --> 01:48:08,989
[SPEAKER_24]: 6 o'clock or 6.30?

1282
01:48:10,330 --> 01:48:08,989
6.30.

1283
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:11,531
[SPEAKER_24]: Very brief meeting.

1284
01:48:11,571 --> 01:48:15,153
[SPEAKER_24]: I know there's another meeting at the high school that most of you want to attend.

1285
01:48:17,475 --> 01:48:20,317
[SPEAKER_24]: This particular webinar and the PowerPoint

1286
01:48:20,992 --> 01:48:24,975
[SPEAKER_24]: speaks to a few different issues, one of which is accountability.

1287
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:34,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, as you all know, in years past, schools get accountability ratings and the district gets a rating, which is only as good as its lowest schools rating.

1288
01:48:35,563 --> 01:48:45,370
[SPEAKER_24]: Because the next generation MCAS was a new test, the state has decided that this year we will have a very different way of reporting accountability.

1289
01:48:46,190 --> 01:48:49,773
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's not based on student scores for grades three through eight.

1290
01:48:50,351 --> 01:48:52,933
[SPEAKER_24]: it's going to be based upon participation rates.

1291
01:48:53,574 --> 01:49:03,382
[SPEAKER_24]: So as long as you have a participation rate of 90% or better, the school remains in a level two, which we currently were last year.

1292
01:49:03,903 --> 01:49:08,046
[SPEAKER_24]: So they're not going to come out and look at student scores to reassign accountability levels.

1293
01:49:08,687 --> 01:49:15,613
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, we will have that, um, information for you, um, on Wednesday when it's publicly released.

1294
01:49:17,052 --> 01:49:18,932
[SPEAKER_24]: This will serve as the new baseline.

1295
01:49:19,632 --> 01:49:25,794
[SPEAKER_24]: So next year, the DESE is projecting that we will go back to a different kind of accountability rating.

1296
01:49:25,834 --> 01:49:29,094
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, what that's going to be is not yet decided on.

1297
01:49:29,514 --> 01:49:31,595
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're still waiting for details on that.

1298
01:49:33,015 --> 01:49:43,677
[SPEAKER_24]: The second area that the webinar discussed, the PowerPoint discussed, is that the new MCAS exam, again,

1299
01:49:44,274 --> 01:49:46,535
[SPEAKER_24]: For many of our students, they took it on computer.

1300
01:49:46,776 --> 01:49:51,738
[SPEAKER_24]: Some students took it on paper and pencil still, which was allowable.

1301
01:49:53,059 --> 01:49:57,342
[SPEAKER_24]: And gradually, it's all going to go to a computer-based.

1302
01:49:57,802 --> 01:50:04,606
[SPEAKER_24]: So this year, in the spring, we're going to have more grades that will be required to be tested students on the computers.

1303
01:50:05,127 --> 01:50:10,810
[SPEAKER_24]: And by 2019, all the exams, except, I think, for the science high school,

1304
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:12,232
[SPEAKER_24]: will be computerized.

1305
01:50:12,252 --> 01:50:19,419
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're moving more and more towards that, and we're preparing with our equipment and all that to make students ready for that.

1306
01:50:21,621 --> 01:50:24,323
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so we had a lot of trial runs last year.

1307
01:50:24,343 --> 01:50:28,187
[SPEAKER_24]: It went pretty well, so we're hoping to have similar results this year.

1308
01:50:29,628 --> 01:50:36,034
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the major differences that I want to call your attention to is how the scores are reported.

1309
01:50:36,768 --> 01:50:37,929
[SPEAKER_24]: under the new exam.

1310
01:50:38,469 --> 01:51:03,063
[SPEAKER_24]: So in the PowerPoint, if you turn to the section on scoring, the categories are not going to be advanced, proficient, needs improvement, or failing warning.

1311
01:51:03,623 --> 01:51:05,284
[SPEAKER_24]: We have four new categories.

1312
01:51:05,912 --> 01:51:12,094
[SPEAKER_24]: And so as we're getting the reports in today, the data is organized into those categories.

1313
01:51:13,034 --> 01:51:18,536
[SPEAKER_24]: We have to replace advanced, we have exceeding expectations.

1314
01:51:19,736 --> 01:51:24,098
[SPEAKER_24]: Proficient is now being replaced with meeting expectations.

1315
01:51:25,618 --> 01:51:31,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Needs improvement is being replaced with partially meeting expectations.

1316
01:51:32,267 --> 01:51:36,550
[SPEAKER_24]: And warning is being replaced with not meeting expectations.

1317
01:51:37,391 --> 01:51:43,296
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, we're dealing with very different proficiency or different categories of ratings.

1318
01:51:43,336 --> 01:51:45,577
[SPEAKER_24]: We want to pay attention to that.

1319
01:51:46,438 --> 01:52:01,450
[SPEAKER_24]: And the state makes a very important point when they state that the proficient meeting expectations, the requirements for that, the rubric for that are more rigorous than the rubric for proficient.

1320
01:52:02,132 --> 01:52:05,535
[SPEAKER_24]: So, again, it's not quite equatable, you know, equally.

1321
01:52:05,575 --> 01:52:16,363
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't say that proficient and meeting expectations is exactly the same because the expectations are going to be higher for meeting expectations than they were for proficient.

1322
01:52:16,983 --> 01:52:18,884
[SPEAKER_24]: So, we're getting all of the data together.

1323
01:52:18,985 --> 01:52:30,333
[SPEAKER_24]: Tomorrow, we're meeting with the directors and Dr. Riccadeli and Mrs. Caldwell and myself to put things in a format for you for Wednesday evening.

1324
01:52:31,076 --> 01:52:38,961
[SPEAKER_24]: Everything is embargoed until Wednesday, and so we'll have all of that for you, as well as a preliminary report on Wednesday evening.

1325
01:52:39,542 --> 01:52:44,905
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you have any questions on the PowerPoint, the information there, I'd be more than glad to answer those for you.

1326
01:52:45,766 --> 01:52:51,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, there are still questions that are unanswered, that we're waiting for some clarity from the state.

1327
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:58,554
[SPEAKER_24]: The high school still remains with the same categories, advanced, proficient, needs improvement, and failing.

1328
01:52:59,170 --> 01:53:05,593
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're still working with the older version of MCAS at the English and mathematics and science levels at the high school.

1329
01:53:06,974 --> 01:53:07,674
[SPEAKER_24]: Any questions?

1330
01:53:08,695 --> 01:53:09,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any questions?

1331
01:53:12,316 --> 01:53:14,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to receive this paper and place it on file.

1332
01:53:14,658 --> 01:53:15,578
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a request?

1333
01:53:18,359 --> 01:53:25,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Say if it's possible maybe to put the PowerPoint on our website so that way parents will understand how this is going.

1334
01:53:25,866 --> 01:53:26,006
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1335
01:53:26,046 --> 01:53:34,914
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to mention too, and I'm going to ask principals tomorrow at the very last slide, they have actually some, um, information.

1336
01:53:34,974 --> 01:53:37,296
[SPEAKER_24]: Desi's posted information for parents.

1337
01:53:37,877 --> 01:53:44,563
[SPEAKER_24]: So we'll ask principals to put that on their websites because that information is specifically for parents where

1338
01:53:45,047 --> 01:53:48,050
[SPEAKER_24]: this information in the PowerPoint might be more technical.

1339
01:53:48,270 --> 01:53:53,834
[SPEAKER_24]: We can do both, but I think the, um, the resources for parents would be the bet more useful.

1340
01:53:54,315 --> 01:53:55,956
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as we can make sure we put something.

1341
01:53:55,976 --> 01:54:06,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I know that, you know, there's going to be a lot of questions, especially with parents that have already gone through this with, you know, the same child or even with older sibling, uh, older children.

1342
01:54:06,525 --> 01:54:09,187
[SPEAKER_15]: So at least they could get an understanding of what's going on.

1343
01:54:09,227 --> 01:54:09,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1344
01:54:09,407 --> 01:54:09,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1345
01:54:10,008 --> 01:54:12,430
[SPEAKER_24]: Because the student score reports will look different.

1346
01:54:12,810 --> 01:54:27,778
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things that I'm still questioning, and I don't have an answer for it, is that they are going to give student growth percentiles, even though they really aren't using the same instruments to measure the student growth, because we've had different exams over time.

1347
01:54:28,178 --> 01:54:30,779
[SPEAKER_24]: But they say they're still going to give a growth percentile.

1348
01:54:31,179 --> 01:54:36,742
[SPEAKER_24]: How they're going to equate that, when you have apples and oranges, once again, they do this to us all the time, so we're kind of used to it.

1349
01:54:37,378 --> 01:54:47,663
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll take a look at that, but parents will have that data too, although I wonder how valid it is when you are using two different instruments and you're trying to equate things between two different instruments.

1350
01:54:48,743 --> 01:54:49,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1351
01:54:49,283 --> 01:54:49,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1352
01:54:49,483 --> 01:54:49,763
[SPEAKER_13]: Krutz.

1353
01:54:50,284 --> 01:54:50,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

1354
01:54:50,824 --> 01:54:51,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

1355
01:54:51,284 --> 01:54:51,644
[SPEAKER_11]: Nelson.

1356
01:54:52,044 --> 01:54:53,045
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have a question.

1357
01:54:53,105 --> 01:55:00,008
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we have good participation rates and we're above 90% and we have good graduation rates,

1358
01:55:00,642 --> 01:55:08,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And if our students are in partially meeting expectations, would that affect us and put us into a different level?

1359
01:55:09,367 --> 01:55:13,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is it going to be strictly by participation rates and graduation rates?

1360
01:55:13,829 --> 01:55:15,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I was a little, I just didn't really know.

1361
01:55:15,790 --> 01:55:17,431
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very different.

1362
01:55:17,451 --> 01:55:20,753
[SPEAKER_24]: I think they didn't know quite know what to do with the accountability this year.

1363
01:55:21,173 --> 01:55:25,556
[SPEAKER_24]: So they came up with something that, you know, in their way is a compromise.

1364
01:55:25,976 --> 01:55:30,058
[SPEAKER_24]: It's our understanding that grades three through eight, it's participation.

1365
01:55:30,546 --> 01:55:34,610
[SPEAKER_24]: You have to have 90% or higher participation to stay in level two.

1366
01:55:35,050 --> 01:55:38,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Now my question, which again I can't get an answer to, is how can you get in level one?

1367
01:55:39,014 --> 01:55:40,275
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they really don't explain that.

1368
01:55:40,315 --> 01:55:43,618
[SPEAKER_24]: If they're not going to use student scores, because that's what we always relied on.

1369
01:55:44,118 --> 01:55:47,842
[SPEAKER_24]: So they're not really giving us a clear response to that right yet.

1370
01:55:48,628 --> 01:55:57,695
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, it's participation rate and graduation rate is our understanding as the sole criteria for the accountability levels.

1371
01:55:58,055 --> 01:56:15,128
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the data from the student scores this year will be used as the baseline data, and next year they're going to go back to some kind of a different system, which again, still haven't made all the guidelines for that, which will probably factor in student scores, since we'll have a year of baseline data on that.

1372
01:56:16,348 --> 01:56:19,871
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my understanding, subject to change by them, not us.

1373
01:56:19,891 --> 01:56:23,954
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a pretty good idea right now of participation.

1374
01:56:24,094 --> 01:56:28,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, we really feel very confident that participation rates have been met.

1375
01:56:29,097 --> 01:56:34,401
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the things that's tricky with participation, it's not just the aggregate, it's each of the subgroups.

1376
01:56:34,862 --> 01:56:42,787
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have to be careful when you have a subgroup that's very, very small, that you need more students in that smaller subgroup to participate, to get that 90%.

1377
01:56:43,888 --> 01:56:50,894
[SPEAKER_24]: If you have a subgroup with 10 students, nine out of the 10 have to participate, where if you have a hundred students, it's a lot less students.

1378
01:56:50,914 --> 01:56:55,819
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have to watch those numbers very carefully, but we're pretty confident that we've met it all around.

1379
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:57,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

1380
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:57,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1381
01:56:57,780 --> 01:56:58,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a follow up?

1382
01:56:59,082 --> 01:56:59,402
[SPEAKER_13]: One more.

1383
01:56:59,422 --> 01:57:00,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Apologize.

1384
01:57:00,243 --> 01:57:08,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I know everybody wants to get out, but the fact is, is that now the 10th graders that took it this year, that didn't change for them or were they grant?

1385
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:10,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I went back and forth with this.

1386
01:57:11,057 --> 01:57:13,239
[SPEAKER_24]: Tenth graders, nothing really changed.

1387
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:14,280
[SPEAKER_24]: It was the old exam.

1388
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:17,823
[SPEAKER_24]: It was the legacy MCAS, which is the older exam.

1389
01:57:18,483 --> 01:57:22,047
[SPEAKER_24]: They are still going to be rated on the old levels.

1390
01:57:22,587 --> 01:57:25,229
[SPEAKER_24]: Advanced, Proficient, Needs Improvement, and Warning.

1391
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:31,074
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll see in the reports that we're providing for you that those categories are different for the high school testing.

1392
01:57:31,775 --> 01:57:33,817
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that hasn't changed.

1393
01:57:34,516 --> 01:57:35,837
[SPEAKER_24]: in terms of that exam.

1394
01:57:36,317 --> 01:57:40,199
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, the students are pretty much taking everything on paper at the high school level.

1395
01:57:40,859 --> 01:57:49,443
[SPEAKER_24]: We're waiting for some more direction with that and when they're going to actually transition to computers and when they're going to transition to the newer version of the test.

1396
01:57:49,923 --> 01:57:53,625
[SPEAKER_24]: All things that the DESE still hasn't, I guess, decided on.

1397
01:57:54,565 --> 01:57:57,887
[SPEAKER_15]: And they haven't come out with any type of plan about how they're going to gradually

1398
01:57:59,508 --> 01:58:11,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we've discussed this in the past, but especially the high school students, I mean, if they're taking, you know, these MCAS in the 9th grade and then all of a sudden the 10th grade it changes, I mean, are we going to make sure that we grandfather these students in?

1399
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:15,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I don't want to set up the students, and I'm sure none of us do, to fail.

1400
01:58:15,584 --> 01:58:19,868
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I mean, I just hope, I mean, I know I've been on the boards with them.

1401
01:58:19,888 --> 01:58:21,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I know how they change their things overnight.

1402
01:58:22,450 --> 01:58:33,347
[SPEAKER_15]: But I mean, we really, as a committee, as a city, try to get our voices out there because I just don't want to see our kids taking them all the way up until the 8th grade or 9th, and then all of a sudden,

1403
01:58:34,152 --> 01:58:40,236
[SPEAKER_15]: We change it overnight on them, and now that determines whether they're not going to pass or not.

1404
01:58:40,376 --> 01:58:45,840
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want our eyes and ears open for that, because I'm sure, I mean, I know the administration does.

1405
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:48,762
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.

1406
01:58:48,822 --> 01:58:51,824
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we have to advocate for that, because that's really high stakes.

1407
01:58:52,245 --> 01:58:56,928
[SPEAKER_24]: That depends on your diploma, and that really is, you really should be doing that to students unfairly.

1408
01:58:57,208 --> 01:58:58,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and it's not fair.

1409
01:58:58,049 --> 01:58:59,089
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not fair to those students.

1410
01:58:59,109 --> 01:59:01,531
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not fair to anybody, but those students especially.

1411
01:59:05,940 --> 01:59:07,301
[SPEAKER_13]: seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

1412
01:59:07,361 --> 01:59:08,122
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1413
01:59:08,462 --> 01:59:08,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

1414
01:59:08,822 --> 01:59:09,483
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

1415
01:59:09,523 --> 01:59:10,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1416
01:59:10,283 --> 01:59:11,724
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make a general announcement.

1417
01:59:12,925 --> 01:59:20,450
[SPEAKER_13]: At 5 o'clock on Thursday, we're having a birthday party for this building, as well as dedicating several unique spaces within it.

1418
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:21,551
[SPEAKER_13]: So come on down.

1419
01:59:21,571 --> 01:59:22,492
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be a fun night.

1420

[SPEAKER_13]: Birthday cake and food.

1421
01:59:25,133 --> 01:59:25,954
[SPEAKER_13]: So come on down.

1422
01:59:27,095 --> 01:59:28,816
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a motion to adjourn this meeting.

1423
01:59:28,916 --> 01:59:29,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, no, no, no.

1424
01:59:29,376 --> 01:59:30,877
