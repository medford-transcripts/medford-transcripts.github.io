    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=99.845s">I'm</a>  sorry, 20-672? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=100.425s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=114.629s">This</a>  is communications from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=120.071s">December</a>  1st, 2020, to President John Falco and honorable members of the Medford City Council, from Rianna Lungo-Koehn mayor, regarding licensing of food trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=128.175s">Dear</a>  President Falco and members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request that the City Council approve the following list of food trucks for events. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=136.877s">that</a>  are scheduled for the coming months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=140.498s">In</a>  the city's temporary policies, limiting events and gatherings, the attached application includes some unique considerations, which have been reviewed and approved by my office, as well as the Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=153.362s">Method</a>  streets updated request. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=156.283s">Location</a>  dates to be determined by resident request, seeking up to five locations between November and March, requesting one lunch, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=164.878s">and</a>  or dinner in one dessert truck per location and or date. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=170.122s">Thank</a>  you for your consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=171.483s">Respectfully</a>  submitted, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=173.604s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=177.327s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=178.007s">It's</a>  my understanding that Annemarie Aigner is on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=181.71s">She's</a>  behind this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=182.751s">I</a>  think she can speak more specifically into what they're seeking.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=188.415s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=190.017s">Councilor,</a>  Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=192.119s">Yeah,</a>  I do believe this paper was before the council previously and the council said we have no problem with entertaining the idea provided that they provide us with the dates and locations as to when these food trucks are going to be operating in our community.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=201.227s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=205.49s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=205.81s">Council</a>  Knight, I believe you are correct in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=208.633s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=210.263s">did</a>  you say, I'm sorry, Councilor Morell, did you say someone was on the call that?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=213.825s">Yeah,</a>  it's Anne-Marie Aigner, A-I-G-N-E-R. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=218.548s">And</a>  I think it's just that their request has been updated.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=222.21s">And</a>  the mayor has her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=223.23s">So</a>  let's see.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=225.191s">Mayor,</a>  you want to go first? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=227.072s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=227.573s">I</a>  don't know if Anne-Marie is on the call, but I know Jackie Peeks, our communications director is on the call as well as myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=233.956s">And</a>  this is something that I believe was approved by the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=237.88s">Months</a>  ago, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=239.422s">It</a>  wasn't taken advantage of, so we're asking for the extension of the up to five dates per resident requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=246.549s">And</a>  we ask for your approval of that tonight.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=248.931s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=249.972s">I</a>  don't recall voting in favor of this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=252.115s">I</a>  don't recall voting in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=254.617s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=255.338s">I</a>  don't recall voting in favor of this paper, Mr. President, previously.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=260.42s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=260.94s">It</a>  was contingent upon them submitting the dates to us for further review to dates and locations for further review. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=265.821s">But</a>  it wasn't something that we said, yeah, okay, do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=267.882s">Just</a>  go five locations anytime you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=270.683s">We</a>  still wanted to know the dates and times and locations.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=272.623s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=273.323s">And</a>  this paper tonight doesn't provide that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=276.284s">Um,</a>  and I should have a Jackie peaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=279.105s">Do</a>  you want, would you like to speak on this issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=288.787s">Jackie.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=294.422s">Jackie</a>  looks like she might be having some technical issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=298.807s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=303.972s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=305.093s">I</a>  remember this coming up before and I thought we voted in favor, but I wasn't sure, but I don't have any problem voting for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=313.542s">I'm</a>  a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=316.612s">Who</a>  comes out to food trucks between November and March? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=319.533s">I</a>  mean, I want it to be successful, but who's gonna be standing out in January outside freezing with a food truck? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=329.516s">That's</a>  my only question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=334.117s">I</a>  wanna see the thing be successful, but how successful are you gonna be between the coldest months of the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=341.699s">Standing</a>  in someone's driveway, parking, standing in the snow with a food truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=347.571s">That's</a>  really my only question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=348.792s">I</a>  mean, you know.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=350.753s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=351.973s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=353.434s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=354.475s">I</a>  did speak with Anne Marie and I know a few just food trucks are operating this way and that they're taking all orders ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=360.758s">So</a>  it's really people placing orders ahead of time online. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=363.159s">People</a>  come out to the food truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=364.38s">It's</a>  a, you know, a contactless handoff to get their meals, social distancing, waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=369.382s">I</a>  think it's really just another way to kind of get get take-out in these times.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=395.39s">We</a>  just lost the audio connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=396.951s">I'm</a>  not here for a meeting.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=398.313s">I'm</a>  not here for a TV show.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=399.674s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=400.254s">So</a>  he's working on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=402.696s">Please</a>  continue.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=403.717s">So,</a>  Mr. President, ultimately, I believe the food truck licensing process was established as a pilot program, if I'm not mistaken, well before my time on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=412.584s">And</a>  I guess my question is, has this <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=414.342s">application</a>  process change now? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=416.144s">I</a>  mean, are we doing things differently than we were previously based upon the nature of the applications? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=420.308s">And</a>  if so, maybe that's something we need to talk about because the council has prioritized the food truck ordinance as something that we want to look at moving forward on through the ordinance subcommittee, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=431.118s">So</a>  if there's any changes to the application process that's going on, it might be nice for us to know about that as well so that as we <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=436.784s">further</a>  discussions on the food truck ordinance, we can have some of the input that the administration's had based upon the applications and the nature of requests that they've seen over the course of the last year or so.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=447.841s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=451.453s">Councilman</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=452.454s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=453.074s">Again,</a>  I think that I, for beginning, I think this is moving forward to initiate the involvement in food trucks in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=462.598s">I</a>  think that it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=464.819s">I</a>  think that you're seeing that as a positive trend. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=469.642s">And</a>  I think it's important to add this aspect to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=472.283s">But</a>  again, my biggest concern, especially with the <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=477.768s">with</a>  the dire issues with our brick and mortar buildings right now, approving five dates without certainty. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=487.496s">I</a>  think it falls into the confusion that I have is taking business away from those organizations that are drowning right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=497.864s">So</a>  these are the questions that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=499.826s">That's</a>  why I believe it was in committee with the ordinance so we could talk about this and vet it out properly because I <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=507.312s">Like</a>  I said, I'm not against the food trucks, I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=510.093s">I</a>  would love to see someday an area where we line 20 food trucks down in a certain area like they do in other communities and followings come out to that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=522.355s">But</a>  when you're talking about what's happening, even right now with the governor's order of restaurants and the limitations of people at a table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=535.154s">putting</a>  a food truck on a busy weekend day next to a establishment in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=542.642s">And</a>  instead of people doing takeout out of that area to keep them going, and bringing in a food truck that might not even be part of, even registered in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=554.074s">I</a>  find that a problem right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=555.675s">So</a>  I can't, I wouldn't support this right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=557.815s">I</a>  think it's important that we establish what we wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=562.196s">If</a>  there's a date, if there are events that the mayor is asking for, that's what we've done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=567.238s">Until</a>  we finalize this, until we get through this pandemic, until brick and mortar establishments <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=575.42s">are</a>  on solid ground again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=576.741s">I</a>  apologize, but I just, as much as I like it, I just, there's too many variables right now that I get weighing against my decision to vote in favor of anything tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=587.967s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=588.388s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=589.788s">We</a>  have Jackie Peeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=598.093s">Jackie,</a>  I'm going to try to unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=599.354s">Oh,</a>  there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=601.335s">Hi,</a>  is that working?</p>

    <p>[Peeks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=602.516s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=604.233s">Okay,</a>  sorry, for some reason there was sound issues with Zoom initially, so I couldn't hear what you were saying at the very beginning and I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=614.668s">Ann</a>  Marie is here and can provide much more detail on the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=619.555s">And</a>  I again, apologize, I don't know what the initial questions were, but just to provide some context for the initial application that came through, I believe it was in June or July. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=629.722s">And</a>  this is again, just an extension of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=634.345s">What</a>  the streets program is seeking to do is by resident request, they would bring a truck to a residential area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=641.53s">We'd</a>  worked with them on their application and sort of specified <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=647.113s">working</a>  in residential neighborhoods as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=650.214s">And</a>  per the council's request, initially, we had heard some questions to come back and clarify the specific dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=658.537s">And</a>  based on what the program is designed to do, it's by resident request, which they may not have at this moment in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=665.54s">So</a>  what we've asked Anne Marie and her team to do is if there is a resident request, they would come back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=670.782s">We</a>  would alert the council as to the proposed date and location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=675.043s">and</a>  that's how that would be if the council would agree to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=681.855s">And</a>  I think, you know, this is, again, I would defer to Ann Marie for details of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=687.197s">I</a>  would also just like to mention that more recently, the street team has been reaching out to schools and PTAs and sort of working with schools to provide additional support where, you know, families may need fundraising and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=701.623s">So</a>  they are willing to, you know, they would like to work with the community and support the community in various ways as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=709.366s">But</a>  again, I would defer to Ann Marie on details.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=712.083s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=712.863s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=714.424s">I</a>  certainly appreciate their willingness and desire to want to work with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=718.725s">We</a>  have a number of great establishments in Medford, like Roswell's Restaurant, for example, does great work here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=724.307s">This</a>  councilor just recognized Richie for the work he does in his philanthropy here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=729.07s">So,</a>  you know, we have a number of businesses that want to do good things for the people that live here that are based here in this community as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=734.352s">I</a>  did hear that the way this is is they want a blanket permit and then they want to come back to the council to tell us when they're coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=740.814s">Well,</a>  that's pretty much the way it works right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=742.814s">If</a>  you want to come, you just tell us what the date is and the time is and you come before the council with your application and we'll hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=747.836s">So,</a>  I'm a little confused as to why we're changing the process when the processes seem to work pretty well in the past and if, you know, it's like not like they're going to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=755.878s">If</a>  they don't know, there are people here that are going to buy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=757.779s">It</a>  sounds like it's pretty much just, does your neighborhood want to do delivery from this pizza place today? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=761.701s">Because</a>  this pizza place will come to your neighborhood with the truck and bring you the food. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=765.623s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'm looking at this and I'm kind of saying, we're changing the process now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=771.326s">It</a>  seems like the process that we've had in place previously is a process that would work just fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=775.549s">They</a>  have a date, a time, and a location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=776.949s">If</a>  they want to go to a neighborhood, come before us, petition us, and we'll vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=780.551s">But</a>  a blanket permit and the changing of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=784.829s">material</a>  application of the food truck pilot program, which shouldn't be called the pilot program anymore because it's been in place for like nine years, you know, is ultimately problematic to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=794.679s">And</a>  this is a paper that, you know, I don't think we need to deviate from the way we've been doing things, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=799.463s">I</a>  don't think this makes it any <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=803.166s">better</a>  for the community, any more protections for our business community? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=807.39s">Just</a>  based upon what I'm hearing right now, maybe my mind can be changed and I can be swayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=811.654s">But</a>  I just kind of, I'm starting to get the feeling that it's like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=815.963s">It</a>  doesn't matter what the rules say. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=817.084s">We're</a>  just doing anything, however we feel like doing it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=819.646s">And</a>  then when anybody says anything about it, it's coronavirus. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=823.73s">So</a>  I'm a little confused by the way the application process has changed and the way that the criteria has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=829.755s">With</a>  that being said, I'm not opposed to food trucks in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=832.017s">I</a>  think we should have an ordinance, and I think we should allow them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=835.04s">But</a>  I think it needs to be tightened up a little bit more than what we have here presently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=838.703s">The</a>  proposed ordinance is far more restrictive than what's been outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=842.646s">this</a>  document right here, for example, the proposed ordinance would say that if you are going to be located within 200 yards of a brick and mortar establishment, you have to get their permission to locate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=853.014s">So</a>  there are some things I think that, you know what I mean, safeguards that we can put into the community, and that's what we've been working on through the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=859.338s">So,</a>  you know, when I look at this, it's not something that I'm comfortable supporting this evening right now, I'll tell you that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=865.703s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knights. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=866.704s">We</a>  have Anne Marie with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=868.505s">Anne</a>  Marie, can we have your name and address for the record? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=870.687s">I'm</a>  going to unmute you right now.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1038.624s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I don't think anyone behind this reel thinks this is a bad idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1044.55s">I</a>  think what I'm hearing from my colleagues is that in the past when we approved food trucks, we always got date and location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1053.578s">And</a>  I would feel more comfortable that we revisit this when there's an actual date and location of an actual truck that would like to come into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1063.771s">And</a>  we'll take them as we've done in the past, Mr. President, each one on its own merit and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1069.537s">But</a>  as this prepares tonight, just an open-ended, you know, list of potential, you know, food trucks, I couldn't support this tonight either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1081.865s">So</a>  I would ask that the administration come back when they do have a full-fledged request.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1102.433s">John</a>  Costas, 56 Hayne Street, business in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1108.895s">This</a>  is the first I've heard about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1111.897s">And</a>  I really think that that's, it's kind of a disservice to all small businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1118.559s">They're</a>  getting hit really, really hard now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1121.481s">And</a>  they just got reduced in capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1125.342s">They</a>  lost their outside dining. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1127.942s">Their</a>  only source of revenue now is takeout or in dining services. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1133.566s">And</a>  to put food trucks and remote, you know, food right in the neighborhood, obviously people are going to like this because it's convenient. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1142.913s">It's</a>  down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1143.773s">They</a>  can just order what they want and they walk down and pick it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1147.516s">But</a>  food trucks should stay like it's been doing by special permit at events. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1152.72s">You</a>  need a food truck at your event, you get food trucks at your event. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1156.897s">But</a>  I think to make it policy that food trucks can come and go in neighborhoods, it's just wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1163.861s">It's</a>  really shows a lack of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1166.842s">I</a>  mean, small, modern, pop little restaurants here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1169.164s">You</a>  know, our restaurants need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1172.345s">And</a>  right now it's getting worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1174.406s">It's</a>  not getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1176.227s">And</a>  now that winter's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1178.128s">So</a>  this is for myself personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1181.49s">I'm</a>  not speaking for the Chamber of Commerce on this, because the Chamber of Commerce, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1185.883s">wasn't</a>  aware this was coming up, so we did not have a discussion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1189.926s">But</a>  as myself, a business owner in Method Square for 40 years, I really have a problem with food trucks in residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1199.072s">And</a>  I agree it should be reconsidered at some future date, but don't, don't hurt our, you know, brick and mortar stores at this time during this COVID period. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1213.162s">It's</a>  just a disservice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1214.583s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1523.109s">We</a>  have, Mr. President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1525.41s">We</a>  have Maria DeStefano from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1527.351s">I</a>  think she'd probably be best to answer this question for you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1530.093s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1530.433s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1532.31s">OK,</a>  we have Maria Giuseppina. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1533.87s">I</a>  just need to unmute her. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1536.151s">Yeah,</a>  I'm trying to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1537.051s">I'll</a>  try again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1550.075s">Adam,</a>  do you want to try to unmute? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1551.855s">We're</a>  going to have the clerk see if he can unmute her. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1553.916s">I'm</a>  not having any luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1557.158s">was</a>  a question about clawbacks.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1559.098s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1560.039s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1560.199s">The</a>  question is just if, you know, if the process to decertify happens because the terms of this agreement aren't met, is there an opportunity or mechanism through the state for clawbacks or is that something that the city would have to pursue otherwise? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1572.501s">Or</a>  have you seen other cities do this again? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1576.602s">Not</a>  that I don't want this to happen, but I'm just trying to understand what that process might look like.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1581.583s">She's</a>  been unmuted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1583.444s">Maria,</a>  you have the floor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_34]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1591.283s">there</a>  because it is you could certainly pursue that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1599.031s">I</a>  have not seen that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1601.733s">I</a>  haven't seen that happen very often. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1603.635s">Typically</a>  the company is really wanting to be in that in a specific location and that municipality really wants them there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1612.103s">So</a>  there's always some type of an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1614.686s">Have</a>  I seen sometimes <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1620.486s">I</a>  haven't seen municipalities act in a way that they would want to decertify that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1628.73s">It</a>  would need, you know, I've seen them do it within reason, but I, you know, when something perhaps is egregious, but not in a, typically I see municipalities and companies working together to try to resolve whatever is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1643.996s">So</a>  the answer is yes, you could, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1645.883s">you</a>  could certainly decertify them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1648.824s">It</a>  would really be on the city to initiate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1653.746s">It's</a>  a fairly easy process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1656.967s">You</a>  send a letter to me and we get it to the EACC and we start the process and they vote on it at a policy meeting or another EACC meeting.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1667.223s">I'm</a>  just trying to understand what that would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1669.305s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1669.445s">And</a>  but there's nothing prohibiting clawbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1672.007s">If</a>  that were something that were to happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1673.588s">I</a>  don't want this to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1674.588s">I'm</a>  not speaking this, but I'm just trying to understand what that would look like.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_34]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1679.012s">So</a>  that would be initiated in the city.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1681.233s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1682.995s">And</a>  then I just have one more question specifically about the tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1685.096s">I</a>  believe it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1685.937s">And</a>  again, I <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1699.029s">So</a>  the hiring would occur over those five years to get to the total of 250. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1701.872s">Let's</a>  see.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1709.221s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1710.382s">Yeah,</a>  this is I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1712.204s">This</a>  is Jeff Monica, vice president of Monogram Gourmet Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1717.338s">and</a>  based in Medford, Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1719.559s">Yes,</a>  mayor and Councilors, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1721.339s">Our</a>  commitment is to employ an additional 200, well, 250 new employees to our company in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1730.003s">And</a>  the period of the, is through, I think it's fiscal 2026, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1736.845s">And</a>  then I believe the chief of staff said last week, then that the terms of the TIF are so that those jobs are held at least until the end of the TIF in 2030 or I guess 2031. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1749.983s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1751.024s">Or</a>  that's how I understood it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1753.648s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1754.349s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1755.646s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1756.907s">Councilor,</a>  I would just advise you that we will probably hire those employees within 12 months of opening the facility, which we anticipate, if the TIF is granted, could be this coming summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1769.572s">We're</a>  trying to target an August 1st start. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1772.554s">If</a>  we don't have the jobs and the people hired, we're not gonna be in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1778.016s">We</a>  gotta move quickly to hire the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1780.897s">So</a>  we're hopeful that that'll happen in the first 12 to 24 months maximum.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1785.415s">OK,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1785.915s">Yeah,</a>  that was my original question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1786.995s">I</a>  was just trying to reflect the language I see in the actual proposed agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1791.016s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1791.397s">That's</a>  all I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1792.417s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1793.457s">We</a>  have Councilor Bears and Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1795.278s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1796.238s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1798.338s">And</a>  I want to echo Vice President Caraviello's statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1801.199s">I</a>  think it's great that we're having commercial investment in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1803.98s">And</a>  I have my general concerns about TIPS as a development strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1809.961s">But</a>  I think in this case, after review and after the questions, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1813.641s">that</a>  have been asked and answered, it seems like a good move for this specific case and this specific project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1820.604s">One</a>  thing I do want to add, I think 250 jobs is a great benefit to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1826.066s">I</a>  think that that would be an even stronger benefit if many of those were union jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1831.148s">As</a>  we know, unionized jobs pay a higher prevailing wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1834.009s">And</a>  that's something that we really need in this community, considering the cost of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1838.151s">So</a>  I would like to motion that the council would send the following language to the city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1843.26s">for</a>  potential inclusion in this agreement pending review by legal counsel and whatever the administration deems necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1851.445s">And</a>  I can read the language when the clerk is ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1861.591s">The</a>  language will just be monogram foods will not contest any efforts by workers at this facility to unionize using card check or any other legally authorized mechanism to establish a collective bargaining unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1872.497s">And</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1873.552s">sending</a>  that language over to the city administration for their review and discussion for potential inclusion in the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1879.838s">I</a>  was encouraged to hear from Mr. Modica that some of the facilities that Monogram operates are unionized, so I would hope that this would be more of a formality than needing to be enforced if workers were to unionize, but I do think it's important <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1897.122s">that</a>  we try to make sure that as many jobs in our community as possible are good union jobs, where workers get the benefits of being in a collective bargaining unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1907.009s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1908.771s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1909.952s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Peers... Would you like to amend that, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1913.674s">Okay,</a>  so... Is that an amendment?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1919.338s">It's</a>  a motion to send language to the city administration for potential inclusion in the agreement.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1924.802s">It's</a>  a B paper.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1928.825s">So</a>  on that B paper, seconded by... I have a couple of concerns about it, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1934.568s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Morell, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1938.134s">I</a>  think it needs to be reviewed by legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1940.035s">And</a>  the reason I think that, Mr. President, is because we can't request that an entity or an organization waive their rights under federal law as a condition of permitting, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1950.641s">So</a>  I think that that's something that might need legal review from Solicitor Scanlon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1955.444s">But</a>  I would like to offer a C paper, Mr. President, requesting that Monogram Foods and the administration meet with Boston Building Trades. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1966.747s">to</a>  discuss the potential for a project-specific labor agreement at this house, at this location for the build-out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1973.228s">And</a>  that gentleman would be Francis X. Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1975.549s">He's</a>  the Chairman of the Building Trades at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1977.529s">I'd</a>  offer that as a C paper, Mr. President, if this is approved and moving forward.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1981.03s">So</a>  we have a C paper offered by Council on 8.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1983.231s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1983.891s">Second</a>  by Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1986.551s">And</a>  Mr. President, if I may.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1989.232s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1989.872s">Just</a>  to clarify on the B paper, absolutely pending legal council review or any other <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=1996.212s">it</a>  would be at the administration's discretion to ask Solicitor Scanlon about the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2000.976s">So</a>  that's my intent in this motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2003.098s">Second,</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2004.279s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2004.92s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2006.501s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2007.462s">I</a>  do have one more question regarding if there is any update from the administration as far as findings regarding to the applicability of the soldier ordinance to this project and what that might look like.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2019.332s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2020.073s">Councilor</a>  Morell, that was to Alicia Hunt.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2025.102s">I'm</a>  sorry, I wasn't available earlier to respond to this, but I am meeting with Mr. Modica from Monogram Foods on Thursday to review our solar ordinance and the requirements for it and to see how it fits with their project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2043.272s">I</a>  do believe that it's going to be applicable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2046.874s">I</a>  don't see it being a huge burden on their company, but we'll be talking about it in more detail on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2054.636s">And</a>  I think he has something to add.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2057.878s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2058.498s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2059.379s">I'll</a>  wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2060.499s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2061.24s">Since</a>  last week's meeting, we have engaged with our engineering team to begin looking at this pending the approval of the TIF. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2071.186s">The</a>  building roof has got some sloped portion and there is quite a bit of refrigeration equipment, which contains ammonia. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2080.351s">Um,</a>  so we'll have to look at how that would interface. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2082.792s">And</a>  that caused me to schedule a meeting and work with work through Dave Rodriguez of economic development and the mayor staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2089.095s">And</a>  we're got the team together. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2090.655s">I've</a>  got my engineers available tomorrow, pending the outcome tonight to meet with Alicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2096.798s">Uh,</a>  I would just tell you two other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2098.579s">We</a>  have our meat snack plant in Chandler, Minnesota is 100% supplied electricity from 13 solar gardens that we have in the state of Minnesota. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2109.685s">and</a>  that's a program through XL Energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2111.706s">So</a>  we are very, if it will work and we can, structure will have supported, we will go forward and take a look at that to the best of our ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2121.429s">Remember,</a>  this is a lease building and the owner Medford Bakery Realty LLC is the actual owner of the facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2130.711s">We</a>  are a tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2132.032s">So</a>  they will have to be brought in once we determine applicability with working with Alicia and her team. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2140.091s">That's</a>  the update since last Tuesday's meeting.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2143.473s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2144.054s">Thank</a>  you both.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2145.515s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Rao.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2147.516s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2149.718s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2150.278s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2151.199s">And</a>  I want to thank...</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2156.358s">This</a>  council last week tabled this request in order to notify residents of the Wellington and Haines Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2166.384s">And</a>  in particular, I want to thank the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2169.565s">They</a>  sent out a great robocall, in my opinion, alerting residents of this particular meeting how to participate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2178.11s">And</a>  also, if they had any questions or concerns regarding this TIF <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2183.933s">And</a>  this new establishment, a Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2186.316s">So</a>  I want to thank the administration and thank this council for including residents in their input. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2193.242s">It's</a>  very important during this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2197.325s">Mr.</a>  President, I think it was about four years ago this council voted for the only TIF that I can recall with Bianco Sausage. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2205.312s">And</a>  at the time, Mr. President, their commitment to this city was to add 20 new full-time jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2213.294s">And</a>  now we're looking at a commitment of 250 jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2216.915s">So</a>  I see this as a real job growth and economic recovery. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2223.817s">revitalizer,</a>  which I think will be good for the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2227.521s">And</a>  I agree with my colleagues regarding living wages and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2232.506s">And</a>  I'm sure we could probably work towards that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2238.148s">The</a>  questions that I raised last week, I still have this week, Mr. President, and I'm going to propose them again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2244.894s">And</a>  I'm not sure if we've had any time to work on some of this, but I really would like to try to pin down the potential trucking routes <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2257.485s">to</a>  this establishment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2260.388s">I</a>  know we're talking about increasing business there from what currently exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2267.534s">And</a>  I think it's important for those of us that actually surround this, there are neighborhoods around this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2275.902s">I</a>  realize this is a commercial area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2278.864s">But</a>  it's embedded in a residential neighborhood, both the Haines Square and the Wellington neighborhood with many residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2286.886s">So</a>  I would like to find out from maybe Mr. Moniker if he's had the ability to respond to the question that I asked last week of what potential truck routes they will be looking at, knowing that two of the major roads that exist around this area don't allow major trucking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2309.171s">So</a>  in my opinion, that would disperse trucks on some of the secondary roads, and I have a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2316.174s">So</a>  that would be my first question, Mr. President, regarding the truck routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2321.217s">And</a>  if Mr. Monica has had the opportunity to look into it, if not, I think it's something that still requires a response, Mr. President, to this council.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2331.901s">Thank</a>  you, council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2332.501s">Mr.</a>  Monica.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2334.488s">Yes,</a>  thank you council for the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2336.91s">We</a>  have had a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2338.631s">I</a>  have actually have a representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2340.592s">One</a>  of my peers is in Boston area tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2344.775s">They'll</a>  be touring the facility tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2347.176s">We</a>  did look at basic traffic ingress and egress from trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2352.08s">It'll</a>  all be contained to Middlesex. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2355.462s">Is</a>  that Middlesex street or Middlesex road? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2357.283s">I'm</a>  not sure the right name. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2362.006s">And</a>  the truck traffic and employee traffic will be entering on and off of Middlesex. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2368.011s">The</a>  only question that was raised is how difficult will it be to make a left turn out of the property onto Middlesex? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2375.817s">And</a>  just coincidentally, I was talking with Mr. Rodriguez the other day and the chief of police was in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2382.702s">So</a>  I had the unique opportunity of inquiring, are there any restrictions with what type of traffic? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2388.787s">do</a>  we see there, he said, you should have no problem in going in and out and Middlesex. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2393.372s">And</a>  I also inquired about weight restrictions and he said, you should have no problems using Middlesex and an accessing is that highway 28, I think will be the main artery we would take. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2406.504s">to</a>  get out of the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2407.865s">So</a>  I don't anticipate a problem, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2410.847s">Obviously</a>  we have to comply with all traffic and local weight ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2415.41s">That's</a>  common practice for any business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2418.032s">So</a>  I don't anticipate that to be a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2419.973s">And</a>  if left turns are a problem coming out of there, we will generate a right turn only process and route our trucks down Middlesex and loop back around to 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2429.599s">So</a>  that's the research we've done since your question last Tuesday night.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2435.238s">Okay,</a>  I appreciate you looking into that and I thank you for your response. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2441.387s">The</a>  other question I had was, you mentioned originally that Monogram was going to open as two shifts with the potential of a third shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2452.562s">I</a>  know at this point you probably can't commit, but I have a concern about a potential third shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2459.365s">And</a>  I was wondering if a third shift would require the extended hours for any business, and would that be a vote of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2470.05s">This,</a>  I don't think, is a question for Mr. Modica, but I don't know who else we have on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2474.953s">Do</a>  we have Commissioner Moki or anyone else on the call?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2486.672s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2487.772s">Mr.</a>  President, yes, we don't have Commissioner Moki on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2490.514s">We</a>  have Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2491.334s">Hunt,</a>  Mr. Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2493.155s">We</a>  have our traffic engineer, Todd Blake. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2496.984s">But</a>  we do not have Commissioner Mulkey. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2499.166s">My</a>  apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2499.806s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2500.707s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2502.088s">I'm</a>  going to tap it on my zoning book here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2503.829s">Section</a>  94-145, hours of operation of retail or wholesale store, factory, or manufacturing plant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2511.373s">A,</a>  no retail or wholesale store, factory, or manufacturing plant shall conduct business or operate in a single family general residence, apartment, commercial, or industrial zone between the hours of 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2521.119s">and</a>  7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2522.78s">A</a>  special permit to extend those hours of operation between 11 and 7 may be granted by the council provided in section 9481. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2529.908s">So</a>  it appears that the extended hours permit would be applicable in this instance.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2535.374s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2543.117s">That</a>  was helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2543.778s">So</a>  Mr. President, knowing that this would require a special permit of the council, I think eases some of the concern I have regarding a third shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2553.666s">I'm</a>  not saying I'm opposed to a third shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2555.848s">I</a>  realize that the previous business, I believe, did have a third shift, an active third shift there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2561.693s">But</a>  that eases some of my concerns of residents that I spoke to regarding potential trucking at 1, 2, 3 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2569.796s">And</a>  we all know when 18 wheelers go by your house and hit the many potholes we have on our roads and the many divots we have, that it shakes homes and so forth, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2580.379s">So</a>  that's comforting to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2583.18s">My</a>  third point, Mr. President, and I brought this up last week, and it's a major concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2589.584s">Middlesex</a>  Ave, and I don't have to tell anyone behind this reel, is a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2594.927s">The</a>  sidewalk, the road, the lighting, everything on that road is a complete and utter disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2602.812s">There</a>  hasn't been any attention, I've been in the area for almost 30 years now, and there hasn't been any attention to that road since I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2611.757s">And</a>  that's no lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2613.297s">And</a>  I realize it's a state road, and I'm hoping with this partnership through an act of state legislation, which is the TIF agreement, that we could get a commitment similar to what we received just recently from the Department of Transportation regarding the corner of Main Street and South Street, Mr. President, that the city administration, Todd Blake, the city engineer, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2643.704s">sit</a>  and meet with the State Department of Transportation, Mr. President, and put together a full-fledged plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2651.207s">We're</a>  talking about $40 million in renovation, and equipment, and a new establishment, and yet we're talking $0 about infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2664.026s">I</a>  mean, I think it speaks volume about what we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2668.329s">And</a>  it is that road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2671.091s">And</a>  I would just like to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2673.312s">I</a>  believe the mayor said that we had the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2679.176s">I</a>  went through this about a month and a half ago with the BJ's gas station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2683.819s">One</a>  of the major concerns was the exiting from BJ's location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2689.463s">And</a>  again, it was stated, I believe Todd Blake was on the calls, that they would look at the exiting of that particular parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2700.053s">This</a>  is no different, this is a door down. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2702.356s">This</a>  is no different, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2704.518s">And</a>  I think if we're going to talk about $40 million in this commitment, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2709.482s">It</a>  should go hand in hand with improvements to that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2712.164s">So</a>  I'd like to hear from the traffic engineer and the city engineer regarding what the next steps are and potentially how the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2722.149s">I'm</a>  sorry, is it DeStefano, the woman from the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2726.072s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2728.133s">May</a>  be able to get involved on an infrastructure type if indeed they do get involved in moving this forward where she is from the state, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2738.819s">Councilor</a>  Matz, who would you like to hear from first? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2741.281s">Either</a>  one, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2742.542s">Okay,</a>  so Mr. Stefano is right in front of me here, so I will unmute. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2748.466s">I'll</a>  try to unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2749.287s">There</a>  we go, okay.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_34]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2751.449s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2752.85s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2753.891s">Certainly,</a>  I am happy to sit down with, well, whether it's in person or via email. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2761.289s">I'm</a>  happy to sit down with the mayor, with Mr. Rodriguez, with Alicia, whomever I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2767.731s">And</a>  we can talk about, there's several, there's an infrastructure program for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2772.733s">We</a>  can also make connections with MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2775.134s">I'm</a>  happy to help in whatever way I can.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2778.995s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2779.875s">Maybe</a>  if we can hear from the city.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2781.556s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2783.296s">I</a>  think Todd, I thought I saw Todd Blake on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2785.417s">I</a>  got him, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2787.598s">He's</a>  on mute.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2789.545s">Hi,</a>  how are you doing, everyone? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2791.026s">Todd</a>  Blake, Traffic Engineer for City Manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2794.587s">So</a>  council members, thank you for your comments on good points, and I think there'll be other opportunities as we move forward through that permit process you referenced to address these things, but it's a good point to point out to us to get in touch with the state and talk about possible improvements, whether it's related to this or otherwise.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2815.848s">So,</a>  Todd, while we have you, I know you were involved with the BJ's gas station as part of the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2824.734s">Can</a>  you shed some light on what improvements, if any, are going to take place due to the recent approval of the BJ's gas station?</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2833.86s">Yeah,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2835.942s">So</a>  for the BJ's gas station project, we requested that, as part of the permit process, we recommended and requested that they improve <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2845.715s">pedestrian</a>  and bicycle access to that facility, because it was built so long ago, it was very car-centric. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2852.399s">So</a>  they were upgrading the sidewalk, I believe, along the frontage of their establishment, and also from Middlesex to their front door. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2862.305s">And</a>  they were also adding bike lanes and bike sharrows, subject to state approval on the state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2873.242s">Just</a>  to clarify for folks, because it's a gas station, the mitigation for the ped bike was to try to offset the possible additional car traffic, vehicle traffic, by switching the short existing trips to BJ's from car to pedestrian bike that might be shorter trips to potentially offset. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2894.291s">That's</a>  how, because it's counterintuitive to some people, it's a gas station wide pedestrian bicycles, but it's in the hope to <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2901.618s">have</a>  a mode shift of existing short trips to BJ's to offset potentially additional car traffic.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2909.525s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2910.025s">So</a>  Todd, just to fill me in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2912.827s">So</a>  is that commitment based on a commitment between BJ's and the Department of Transportation? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2918.972s">How</a>  does that work?</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2921.314s">So</a>  whatever's on the site, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2923.628s">Well,</a>  it was all permitted through the permit process, but whatever's on the site is through the city permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2928.33s">Whatever's</a>  on the state road is subject to their approval as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2932.712s">So</a>  it's approved locally, but then it also has to get approved by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2936.293s">Similar</a>  to local stream improvements related to development over there, where we recommend improvements on local street, but also at the intersection that the state owns. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2945.557s">So</a>  we approved it local, or the boards approved it locally, and then it's subject to the state approval as well.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2954.242s">Okay,</a>  so any commitment that's on Middlesex Ave would be a commitment of DOT, correct?</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2963.487s">No,</a>  in the BJ's case, if that's what you're asking, the BJ's would be, if they get approved by the state, and another example is the Logan Street example, if the permit process included something in those permits, those examples, they constructed the improvements on state property with states.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2984.742s">So</a>  what you're telling me is then eventually Monogram is going to have to go through the approval process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=2990.725s">And</a>  during that process, a similar agreement that was made with BJ's regarding the licensing and so forth will most likely take place with Monogram in the city regarding any safety concerns on Middlesex Ave.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3008.432s">And</a>  I would imagine there would be opportunity to revisit that during that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3014.3s">I</a>  wouldn't want to say what exactly that process is at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3017.104s">I'd</a>  defer to Paul and Alicia.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3021.928s">So</a>  I guess what I'm trying to do, and I don't feel warm and fuzzy from your response, I'm trying to figure out whose responsibility is it to make sure that Middlesex Ave gets the needed improvements during this approval of a $40 million project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3038.571s">As</a>  we heard from Vice President Caraviello, it's probably one of the larger endeavors that this city has seen, and I don't hear any infrastructure mentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3048.599s">And</a>  I find that hard to believe that we're not discussing infrastructure improvements during such a large project.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3062.199s">Is</a>  that for me as well?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3066.909s">Anyone</a>  from the administration that would like to handle that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3070.171s">I</a>  just would like to hear some more concrete information on what potentially negotiations will exist, what meetings are going to be called, what's going to happen to that roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3083.919s">Has</a>  anyone walked down that roadway? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3085.6s">Am</a>  I the only one that's ever walked down Middlesex Ave? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3089.402s">It's</a>  a complete nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3091.023s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3091.563s">It's</a>  a complete nightmare.</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3093.404s">Walk</a>  down. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3094.918s">We</a>  have a scheduled meeting with MassDOT District 4 on another matter that everyone's interested in, Maine itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3103.464s">So</a>  whenever we meet with them, we'll take the opportunity to discuss possible improvements on any state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3109.788s">We</a>  work all the time with MassDOT and DCR to get improvements wherever we can, whenever we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3116.173s">You</a>  know, recent examples with DCR on Fellsway West, Bump House, and that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3122.722s">you</a>  know, so we will have the opportunity very soon to talk with Matthew and touch base upon, you know, the condition of Middlesex Avenue and our request.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3136.712s">If</a>  I may, Council Members, I think may have a longer hand up.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3140.114s">Yes,</a>  I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3140.754s">I</a>  think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3141.595s">Hunt</a>  has something to add, but I just want to just reassure you with Maria's help and our <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3147.812s">we're</a>  not looking for improvements for monogram, but as <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3168.234s">I</a>  think you have more department heads on here than I announced earlier, many more, but we will work together to try to get some much-needed improvements to Middlesex Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3177.457s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3178.977s">Point</a>  of information, Councilman Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3180.678s">It</a>  appears that this project would be subject to linkage fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3183.078s">Would</a>  the administration be willing to dedicate the linkage fees that are generated through this project for improvements to Middlesex Avenue for partnering with the state in making those improvements?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3190.901s">May</a>  I long occur?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3200.178s">I'm</a>  miss hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3200.959s">If</a>  you want to help me with this, but with regards to linkage fees and then I can.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3205.882s">I</a>  would be happy to speak to the linkage fees question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3209.444s">So</a>  I would have to examine whether or not linkage fees are going to be levied on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3215.328s">But</a>  what I can tell you is that linkage fees, the linkage funds that we have do not, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3223.267s">have</a>  to be spent directly at that moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3227.49s">So</a>  we actually have a linkage account that can be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3230.573s">The</a>  difficulty here is that it's a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3234.075s">We've</a>  been developing very excellent relationships with MassDOT over the past 11 months, and we feel very confident that we can have a conversation with them about improvements to Middlesex Ave and who would be paying for such improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3251.485s">And</a>  in fact, as part of the BJ's commitment through the site plan review process that was being required of them through the community development board, is that they will be paying for the bike lane improvements, all and restriping of Middlesex Ave, inclusive of the area in front of this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3273.186s">as</a>  part of their approval, pending approval with MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3277.768s">We</a>  don't think it'll be hard to get the improvement for MassDOT to have the private company pay for this striping. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3284.61s">We</a>  haven't worked our way through the entire conversation with them, but we feel that that will go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3291.813s">We</a>  can also have a conversation with MassDOT about the application of linkage funds that we have for this area and for improving that road <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3303.223s">if</a>  that would be of assistance in getting MassDOT to approve the improvements, as you're saying, to this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3313.53s">We'll</a>  also be working with- So you have no question, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3316.312s">Yes,</a>  linkage fees apply, and yes, we'll be willing to do it, and no, we won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3319.414s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3319.934s">That's</a>  as simple as I'm looking at you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3322.116s">So</a>  if they apply, yes, we would absolutely bring them to this location.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3326.659s">Okay,</a>  why would linkage fees not apply at this location?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3330.797s">So</a>  linkage fees apply for new development. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3334.02s">And</a>  this is a renovation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3336.041s">And</a>  so it is unclear to me.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3337.703s">Renovation</a>  over a certain size. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3339.564s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3339.945s">A</a>  substantial reservation in excess of 50% of the structure that's 10,000 square feet, which is what this project is, I believe, based upon what was presented.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3347.511s">So</a>  Paul Mopey and I need to be having a conversation about exactly what is going to be applying to this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3355.757s">But</a>  regardless of that, we can use money in the linkage account for <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3360.609s">for</a>  repair for improvements at this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3364.433s">Depending</a>  on whether we can use any linkage on a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3371.12s">That</a>  is something that we're going to have to clarify because it is not clear to me that we could use any municipal funds on a state road regardless of their source. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3381.129s">And</a>  we actually cannot require a company, a business of any kind to do improvements to a state road without the state agreeing to it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3392.377s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3392.637s">But</a>  we can't partner with the state, just like we've seen neighbors in Malden do, for example, when they partially funded a study for the reconfiguration of the Highland Avenue-Fells Way intersection there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3406.106s">And</a>  the city put up some money to do the traffic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3408.648s">And</a>  once the traffic study was complete, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3410.429s">the</a>  state kicked up the money to do the repairs.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3413.43s">So-</a>  And that, yes, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3416.09s">And</a>  that was a MassDCR partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3418.791s">And</a>  this is a MassDOT road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3421.251s">So</a>  the MassDCR partnership program won't work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3423.972s">We'll</a>  have to talk to MassDOT and see what they're open to.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3429.033s">If</a>  I might add, we have a precedent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3432.093s">We</a>  have worked on similar projects in other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3435.267s">We</a>  have paid to move a curb cut because of that local city traffic engineer said, let's move that curb cut 50 feet to the west or to the east. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3444.354s">So</a>  we will be cooperative. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3446.296s">Obviously</a>  we have to fund our part, which is on our property that we're leasing, but we're going to be smart about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3452.621s">We</a>  do not want a conflict with traffic with the neighboring property, BJ's or any of the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3458.165s">So</a>  we will be supportive of whatever Alicia and the state would like us to do within reason.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3466.935s">Councilor</a>  Marks, you had the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3468.776s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3469.796s">I</a>  know my colleagues have other questions, too, so I'll be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3475.037s">I</a>  just want to make sure, Mr. President, and it sounds like the city has given this some consideration on looking at some of the infrastructure that exists, in particular, Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3486.28s">So</a>  I do feel comfortable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3488.961s">As</a>  a community, we can no longer sit back and state that, oh, I'm sorry, this is a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3494.603s">We</a>  can't do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3495.943s">Because</a>  it's difficult to tell a taxpayer when they're paying $8,000 in taxes that, sorry, we can't touch your tree, we can't trim your tree, we can't do your sidewalk, and we have nothing to do with your road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3507.875s">That's</a>  very difficult, Mr. President, and I think these conversations have to be had when we have the opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3514.181s">And</a>  a $40 million renovation, in my opinion, is the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3518.864s">And</a>  I hope the city keeps us informed regarding what the next steps are on state road improvements, in particular Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3528.91s">Regarding</a>  the TIF agreement itself, Mr. President, and this may be a question for Chief of Staff Rodriguez, is there language in there that would state that there's a 90 day notice <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3541.437s">of</a>  any corporate decision to change the nature or the character of their business operations to notify the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3551.195s">Is</a>  there any language that speaks to that?</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3554.142s">We're</a>  taking a quick review right now, but I don't recall that being as part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3559.587s">I</a>  think Maria can weigh in on that sort of structural change to a TIF agreement after it's approved by the EACC. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3565.693s">They're</a>  generally made with the entity itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3568.155s">I</a>  don't think there's a change in purpose language that's in there, but Maria can expand on whether she's seen that language included before that process worked out.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3578.4s">So</a>  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to look at a few recent TIF agreements, and they had language that stated just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3588.606s">So</a>  I thought it would be helpful that when and if and when we put this agreement together, and I would just state this as a motion, that the administration add a 90-day notice of any corporate decision to change the nature and or character <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3606.116s">of</a>  their business operations that they notified the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3612.211s">And</a>  naturally, if the attorney has to put that, that's just language that I jotted down quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3618.615s">So</a>  I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3622.357s">Also</a>  that if there's not already currently that exist, and again, this would be a question for Mr. Rodriguez, that annual reports on job creation, retention of Method residents be provided to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3638.45s">as</a>  the city of Medford, and I'm not sure if that language currently exists or something similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3643.703s">It</a>  doesn't have to be the exact. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3646.791s">Yeah,</a>  it's in section 70 of the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3650.214s">Okay,</a>  so we can eliminate that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3653.057s">And</a>  then I think as Councilor Morell mentioned, there should be language in there within the TIF agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3660.023s">Failure</a>  to comply will result in decertification. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3664.307s">Somewhere</a>  that should be listed within the TIF agreement itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3668.59s">Mr.</a>  President, and I'm not sure if that's currently in there now, but I would recommend if it's not, that that be a motion as well, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Dave Rodrigues]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3680.324s">It</a>  is also included, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3681.524s">That's</a>  off. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3682.165s">So</a>  it would be just- Thank you, Mr. Chief of Staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3686.446s">So</a>  it would be just that one motion, Mr. President, that the 90 day notice, if there's any change in their business nature or character of their business, that they notify the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3699.49s">And</a>  that's it for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3700.59s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3701.13s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3701.99s">So</a>  that will be a D paper on the motion of Councilor Marks and the D paper seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3709.007s">So</a>  we have a number of councils that want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3711.688s">Next</a>  up is Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Bears, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3717.652s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3718.952s">And</a>  Mr. Monica, I want to thank you for your patience in going through this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3723.135s">I</a>  know it's quite an initiation to the Medford City Council that you've taken over the past couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3728.177s">And</a>  I as one council want to say, number one, it's great to see that your company wants to invest here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3734.121s">Ultimately,</a>  there is zero jobs at this location now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3737.345s">And</a>  with the approval of this TIF, we have the ability to bring 250 jobs to our community, plus the construction jobs that are going to be related to it, plus we're going to be able to redevelop an underutilized site. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3748.762s">And</a>  from my discussions with the city assessor, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3752.507s">If</a>  nothing happens at this property, then we don't lose anything, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3755.589s">I</a>  mean, right now, it is what it is based upon the way the tip is structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3761.332s">In</a>  order for us to move forward on this, we're going to be in a much better place than we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3765.894s">So</a>  why is one councilor uncomfortable supporting this? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3768.815s">I</a>  think we've raised a lot of issues, A paper, B paper, C paper, D paper at this point, Mr. President, and they're all valid, valid concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3780.502s">more</a>  focused, not necessarily on the merits of the organization or the business that's going to be done, but the application in the seamless transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3788.191s">to</a>  a renovation of a site that's located in the neighborhood and our ability to make sure that those that are responsible and accountable to make sure that certain aspects of this job go right do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3800.078s">So</a>  when we talk about linkage and we talk about the solar ordinance, we're talking about items that we want the applicant to know about and know what they're getting into. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3808.543s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3811.304s">This</a>  evening, I'm very comfortable voting to support this TIF. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3813.867s">I</a>  think we've done a good job vetting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3816.229s">We've</a>  taken the opportunity to open our eyes and our ears to the neighborhood and the neighbor's concerns, while also examining the economic benefits that it's going to bring to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3825.857s">So</a>  I, as one councilor, will be supporting this paper this evening, and I would move forward for approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3832.043s">Board</a>  of Information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3833.504s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3836.093s">So</a>  on the motion to approve the paper, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3842.075s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I appreciate that comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3845.516s">However,</a>  we did notify thousands of Method residents of this meeting, and we have yet to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3853.579s">I</a>  know we started off with the council, so I look eager to hear from residents and maybe some of the concerns that may exist out there, Mr. President, as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3863.983s">And</a>  everyone will have an opportunity to ask their questions, make their comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3867.586s">I</a>  have a couple more councilors that would like to speak on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3870.928s">We</a>  have Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3874.55s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3875.991s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3877.012s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Marksx for bringing that point up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3879.714s">I</a>  think that's the last piece that, as we go through this process, that I want to applaud because I think that the word was, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3890.541s">distributed</a>  to that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3892.163s">I</a>  think that the administration did their due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3894.767s">I</a>  think this council did their due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3898.332s">I</a>  think that we are moving forward in a position where bringing jobs, especially possible unionized jobs, to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3906.063s">I</a>  think we've <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3907.345s">We</a>  have hit every target that we were put in this place to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3912.348s">So</a>  I appreciate Mr. Moniker and his team for choosing Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3917.271s">I</a>  think that everything seems to be in a positive outlook. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3922.234s">I</a>  think the administration has done a great job following through with this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3929.519s">As</a>  my fellow colleagues have already mentioned, I will be supporting this unless I hear something really drastic from our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3937.104s">But</a>  I think that Council Marks really hit a nerve when he talks about Middlesex Ave and a forgotten road by our state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3945.651s">And</a>  what other way to do it as an elected official with probably one of the major <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3954.797s">issues</a>  and development growth areas that we'll see there for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3961.859s">So</a>  using that as some leverage to make sure the state and our city administration understands there is a viable neighborhood that really needs some attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3971.841s">So</a>  again, I thank Mr. Moniker and I look forward to seeing the jobs and the possible <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3981.023s">you</a>  know, money going through our businesses in that area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3985.205s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3986.485s">And</a>  again, I look forward to the residents discussion.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3989.567s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3991.828s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3992.928s">I</a>  actually do have a couple of questions on Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=3996.71s">The</a>  first one is for Director Hunt or Engineer Blake, which is, is Middlesex Avenue on any schedule or list for upgrades or repair by MassDOT already?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4012.733s">I,</a>  Todd, do you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4014.513s">I</a>  don't have any list from MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4017.494s">Maybe</a>  you have it?</p>

    <p>[Todd Blake]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4018.454s">We</a>  have Tim McGiver with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4022.335s">Besides</a>  the Wellington Circle study, I'm not aware of others.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4026.435s">City</a>  Engineer, Tim McGiver.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4029.096s">Hi,</a>  good evening, Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4030.996s">So</a>  there is some improvements that are slated by MassDOT on Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4036.397s">I</a>  don't have them right in front of me, but I believe it's second, third, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4042.306s">4th</a>  and 5th Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4043.767s">I</a>  might have got that wrong, but there's four to five intersections that they'll be doing pedestrian upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4049.231s">I</a>  thought it was actually going to happen this season, but it looks like it's going to happen next season.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4052.833s">Would</a>  that include resurfacing, Tim?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4056.287s">No,</a>  I think the project is very focused on ADA compliance and improving the pedestrian ramps at those four intersections. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4063.852s">Again,</a>  I can follow up the exact list of intersections, but it's along that stretch.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4068.715s">That</a>  would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4069.395s">Thanks,</a>  Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4070.075s">And</a>  then this general question for all three of you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4074.79s">And</a>  we just haven't brought it up, but the MBTA right-of-way, there's a train right-of-way that runs right next to this property, actually between BJ's and this property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4084.037s">It's</a>  very old. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4084.758s">It's</a>  the old Medford Branch Railway that used to come down into Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4089.121s">If</a>  you go on Park Street, there's a bridge, and there's a bridge over the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4093.524s">It's</a>  just kind of a pet interest of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4096.086s">Is</a>  there any discussion about use or reuse of that right-of-way that's been mentioned to any city department, as far as you know?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4104.195s">There</a>  is, and Alicia can speak more to the detail of it, there was an exploration of using that for a pedestrian crossover to get out of the Wellington neighborhood, basically, and more of a direct pedestrian connection to the Wellington station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4118.887s">But</a>  I believe that is not going to be happening because the owners of that bridge that goes across the tracks don't want that to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4127.874s">And</a>  Alicia can speak more details of that particular finding. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4131.937s">Is</a>  that, sorry, just quick clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4133.879s">Is</a>  that the bridge on the Fellsway or? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4135.441s">The</a>  bridge that goes over the tracks, over the orange lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4138.404s">It's</a>  actually not a bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4139.585s">It's</a>  the orange line dips down underneath the spur. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4142.668s">Yeah,</a>  it connects to the orange line.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4144.09s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4144.37s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4144.811s">And</a>  thanks, Alicia, in advance.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4146.923s">Right,</a>  we have, so, Mr. Councilor, we have been looking at that for quite a while, that spur, and we've talked to some groups, including Bikes to the Sea, and Walk Medford, and the Bike Commission, about looking at a project to turn that spur into a pedestrian and bicycle path. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4168.527s">We</a>  thought that we could actually cross the orange line there at First Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4174.848s">But</a>  it turns out that there is, in fact, still use of an old train line on top of that that runs above the Orange Line underpass. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4185.834s">And</a>  it's an active use, about twice a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4188.535s">So</a>  we can't cross right there, but we're still looking at whether that spur <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4194.578s">would</a>  be something that we can make into a bike and pedestrian path. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4199.103s">I</a>  know that the residential developer there behind the property next to BJ's, it's building condominium buildings, is actually interested in working with us to turn that into a shared use path. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4214.168s">and</a>  potentially a walking path under 28 if we can figure out if that's gonna be possible at the other end, on the opposite end of that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4225.114s">But</a>  it is something that is on our list of potential future projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4229.937s">We</a>  just haven't had the, frankly, the manpower to invest in developing that further over the past year or so.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4238.329s">I</a>  appreciate you indulging me and asking these questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4241.592s">And</a>  my last one, is there any non-bike or pedestrian or any light rail or heavy rail potential for that right-of-way that's been mentioned or discussed?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4253.922s">It</a>  seems very unlikely.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4256.164s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4256.544s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4258.485s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4258.846s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4260.747s">Any</a>  other questions from the council before we open it up to the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4263.49s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4265.404s">Let's</a>  see, would anyone like to speak on this issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4268.186s">We'll</a>  start off with John. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4271.709s">Can</a>  I mute you? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4272.39s">Trying</a>  to unmute you now.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4276.533s">John,</a>  you have two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4278.574s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4279.795s">Well,</a>  John, president of the Medford Chamber of Commerce, and I think that the 40 years I've been in Medford Square doing business, I think this opportunity is fantastic, and it's not something that comes around very frequently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4296.459s">The</a>  Chamber of Commerce supports it, and I'd like to read a letter into the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4303.443s">To</a>  the Honorable City Council, the Medford Chamber of Commerce supports the mayor's proposal for a TIF in favor of Monogamy and Gourmet Food to take over the old Venom Circus location on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4317.109s">This</a>  building has been vacant for at least two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4320.479s">And</a>  having a well-respected company invest $40 million in this building for the next 50 years is a win for Medford, which includes the residents of the area, since the company will only be operating limited shifts rather than 24-7, as was the case with Bread and Circus. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4339.429s">The</a>  number of job opportunities Monogram Gourmet Food would generate is valuable, especially under the current COVID conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4347.499s">and</a>  having them favoring Medford residents is a plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4352.02s">Opportunities</a>  like this do not come around every day and not to support this proposal would be a disservice to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4360.583s">The</a>  community would gain much more than tax breaks and is very little to ask for considering the great return on the city's investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4369.194s">To</a>  reiterate, we would like very much for the Medford City Council to support this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4375.677s">It</a>  was exciting when I heard about it last week, and it's still exciting today. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4381.059s">So</a>  please consider the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4383.34s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4383.84s">John,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4384.64s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4388.182s">Anyone</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4388.882s">Is</a>  there anyone else that would like to speak on this matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=4409.542s">So</a>  while we're looking for people, we have Mayalongo Kern.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5350.486s">I</a>  think it might make sense for us to outline what votes we took in the subcommittee meeting earlier in the evening so that the people understand what it is that they are either opposed or against. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5361.015s">Right</a>  now it's, are you opposed to a paper that would determine a residential factor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5367.779s">I</a>  don't think that that's really a very indicative of what exactly on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5372.781s">I</a>  think it might be better off set if you know, we had a little breakdown as to what each of these four items meant and what the council voted on in the subcommittee meeting so that we could move forward in that regard.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5384.986s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5386.767s">Ellen,</a>  do you want to speak to those points? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5389.968s">Certainly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5391.309s">Again,</a>  I, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5396.123s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm just going back through. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5399.545s">So</a>  to speak to the first point of a- I may.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5405.569s">I</a>  think, I mean, ultimately the council voted in subcommittee to determine that we would adopt the lowest residential factor, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5413.033s">So</a>  the issue before us is whether or not we want to, people are in favor of us adopting the lowest residential factor by having a single tax rate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5422.013s">And</a>  I mean, I think that's as simple as the explanation goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5424.275s">I</a>  know when we get into the residential exemption and the small commercial exemption, the explanation might be a little bit further than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5430.3s">But</a>  a brief synopsis, I think, would be warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5432.862s">We</a>  don't need to get into the law books on it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5436.925s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5437.065s">I'd</a>  be like to give a brief synopsis on each of those points.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5440.828s">So</a>  maybe we go through the votes that we took, the council voted to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5443.33s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5443.971s">And</a>  then Ellen can explain what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5445.292s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5453.231s">I</a>  can very quickly and briefly say, city council selecting the minimum residential factor of the 91.2072 will provide a split to the maximum, providing the best benefit for the residential properties in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5469.819s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5474.141s">Councilor</a>  Knight, is that good?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5475.801s">Sounds</a>  good to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5476.642s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5477.682s">Next</a>  point, to select an open space discount, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5481.993s">Do</a>  you want to talk to that?</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5483.654s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5484.054s">There's</a>  basically a new point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5487.516s">There</a>  is no properties classified as open space in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5491.918s">So</a>  there's no point for the city to adopt an open space exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5497.621s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5498.921s">Next</a>  point is a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5502.042s">So</a>  the residential exemption is a shift within the residential class from the higher value properties to the lower value properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5512.508s">The</a>  shift occurs within that residential class by giving any owner occupied property, regardless of their value, an exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5522.073s">but</a>  it shifts, it increases the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5525.374s">Therefore,</a>  there becomes a break-even point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5528.355s">And</a>  the break-even point I calculated for fiscal 21 would be any property valued over $727,400. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5534.536s">So</a>  you are allowed to do a residential shift within, an exemption within the shift, within that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5545.119s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5547.199s">The</a>  big caveats to that is it requires an annual application. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5552.964s">We</a>  have not, the city council has not approved this in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5557.208s">It's</a>  something that we should be looking at in the springtime so that residents can apply prior to the generation of a third quarter tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5567.557s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5570.231s">I'm</a>  not sure I can clarify that more if that would help city council.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5576.476s">I</a>  do believe it was not recommended by the administration to adopt such at this point in time.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5581.24s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5582.101s">It</a>  is not recommended. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5583.262s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scott-Belle.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5584.703s">I</a>  know it's something we did say we will visit in March with Ellen and this administration, this council, to see if it's something as we move forward with the numbers increasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5595.431s">So</a>  I wanted to add that, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5597.393s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5597.473s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scott-Belle. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5600.102s">And</a>  Ellen, thank you for that, your comments on the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5606.544s">Did</a>  you want to speak to this small commercial exemption?</p>

    <p>[Ellen Brideau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5610.506s">So</a>  the small commercial exemption provides an exemption for commercial value properties under a million dollars with 10 employees or less. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5621.81s">When</a>  I reviewed the database, we had 241 properties that are under the million dollars in the commercial class. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5628.733s">the</a>  benefit of that doesn't typically help the small business owner, because the small business owner that occupies that space typically isn't the owner of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5640.623s">They're</a>  just the owner of the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5642.625s">So</a>  again, not many communities in Massachusetts offer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5647.929s">A</a>  city council was very, very generous with adopting a small personal property exemption earlier this year, and that assisted small business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5656.912s">So</a>  at this point in time, again, a small commercial exemption, it would probably not be the best time to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5664.958s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5667.92s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5668.661s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5674.885s">So</a>  let's see, Will. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5676.146s">Will</a>  Nevaeh, thank you for waiting patiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5677.947s">You</a>  wanted to speak in favor of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5683.071s">Will?</a> </p>

    <p>[William Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5684.625s">Yes,</a>  sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5686.707s">I</a>  want to thank Adam Knight for giving me a chance to hear that explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5691.892s">That</a>  was helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5694.434s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5698.988s">And</a>  the residential factor, what I want to say is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5701.832s">In</a>  the past few years, Medford has adopted the lowest residential factor available. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5706.477s">It</a>  sounds like you're going to do that again this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5708.84s">Such</a>  a policy has the pro that it reduces the tax burden on residential property owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5715.288s">but</a>  has the con that it increases the burden on commercial development. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5719.151s">I</a>  think if we're worried about lack of commercial development, then we need to look into ways to reduce the tax burden when we do commercial development. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5727.056s">I'm</a>  of course not suggesting you put the residential factor at one today. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5730.319s">That'd</a>  clearly be insane because you've got pandemic and that'd be a tax hike for residential owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5736.723s">But</a>  ultimately, this desire for high commercial growth and high commercial taxes is a contradiction that needs to be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5745.751s">It's</a>  a tough political and technical question that needs answering. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5751.517s">And</a>  the owner-occupied exemption <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5755.055s">It</a>  sounds like you're going to keep that at zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5757.956s">And</a>  I think that is good policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5760.336s">Because</a>  an owner-occupied exemption will encourage people who plan to live in a house to offer more money for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5769.758s">So</a>  the benefit goes to the incumbent owners who will sell for higher prices rather than those buying. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5776.5s">It'll</a>  also increase rental housing costs because renters will have to pay owners more money to dissuade owners selling the apartment to owner occupiers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5784.703s">In</a>  other words, that'd be a pro-condo conversion measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5790.005s">It</a>  would encourage condo conversions, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5792.906s">The</a>  latter aspect raises clear equity concerns because more vulnerable populations tend to rent, and if we sort of push them into buying with this policy, that will, vulnerable populations tend to pay higher interest rates on their mortgages due to, you know, if you make less money, you pay a higher interest rate, and also there's discrimination concerns, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5814.946s">I</a>  think it's important we stick with not doing the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5819.249s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5820.475s">Thank</a>  you, Will. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5821.476s">Is</a>  there anybody else that would like to speak in favor, in favor of the proposal?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5826.9s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5838.069s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5845.278s">Okay,</a>  I believe this is Andrew Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5847.42s">Andrew,</a>  we're trying to unmute you right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5849.221s">Oh,</a>  there you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5849.902s">Andrew,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5852.884s">Good</a>  evening, councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5855.726s">Can</a>  you hear me, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5856.947s">Yes,</a>  we can hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5858.808s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5859.909s">I'm</a>  Andrew Castagnetti, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5862.251s">It's</a>  nice to see you all back in the city hall chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5868.256s">Not</a>  in O'Heiden, but when can the taxpayers come attend in person, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5873.7s">You</a>  know? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5874.26s">We're</a>  trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5876.497s">Got</a>  to get through the COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5878.438s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5879.478s">Anyways,</a>  welcome back to the new admiral. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5883.4s">Thank</a>  you for your attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5884.661s">I'll</a>  be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5886.622s">I'm</a>  here for the 10th year to ask you and the mayor to lower our real estate tax bills for own occupied homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5895.947s">It's</a>  not a hard thing to do, but with the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5899.849s">Simply</a>  adopt mass general law, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5903.098s">Chapter</a>  59, Section 5C, at the full 35% exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5910.244s">This</a>  act will lower the average owner-occupied real estate tax bill by $2,000 yearly in O2-155, as it is being done in Chelsea, Everett, Malvern, Cambridge, and even in all of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5929.621s">So</a>  why not here? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5932.812s">This</a>  Massachusetts state law has been applied for over 28 years times an average of, let's say $1,000 a year equals over $28,000 in total loss savings and all the charge by this city's against the average owner occupied homeowner, if they live in their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5960.718s">So</a>  why not here? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5962.525s">Furthermore,</a>  the city will still receive the full total real estate tax levy that the city demands because the law states that our tax savings is simply shifted and added to all the absentee residential apartment building owners from one unit to 350 unit buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5990.623s">It</a>  is a commercial <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5992.482s">business</a>  enterprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=5995.303s">Furthermore,</a>  these owners mostly don't live or vote in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6003.385s">Imagine</a>  this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6006.006s">Even</a>  our Massachusetts state politicians had a touch of heart to relieve some of our real estate taxpayers when they copied California's Proposition 13 law. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6019.07s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6022.065s">Why</a>  not here? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6022.805s">Because</a>  after all, we own occupied homeowners have a vested interest and take pride in improving our city, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6036.308s">Also,</a>  this would help renters to become first time home buyers in Medford with lower real estate tax bills if they live in the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6050.032s">So</a>  please, I ask again, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6052.34s">Why</a>  not here stop the discrimination and help us adopt the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption under state of Massachusetts law for method homeowners only if they actually live in their house. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6069.465s">Of</a>  course, it is 28 years long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6074.466s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6076.667s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Cassinetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6079.187s">Would</a>  anyone else like to speak in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6085.25s">Seeing</a>  and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6092.655s">Would</a>  anyone like to speak in opposition? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6097.118s">Would</a>  anyone like to speak in opposition of the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6099.62s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6105.004s">Seeing</a>  and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6110.788s">Councilors</a>  have any questions?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6113.67s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6114.491s">Motion</a>  to adopt the lowest residential factor to be used for FY 2021, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6120.28s">On</a>  that motion, by Councilor Knight, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6124.347s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6124.968s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6126.009s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6127.512s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6129.049s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the comments by Mr. Navar that regarding the residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6139.761s">And</a>  some of what he mentioned, if not all, is completely on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6145.247s">that</a>  we heard tonight from the city assessor that Method is a desirable community because we have such a low residential tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6154.849s">And</a>  therefore, people want to come into the community and buy property because we have such a great low tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6163.511s">And</a>  on the flip side, Mr. President, commercial business may not see fit to come to our community because of the extremely aggressive and high tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6175.814s">And</a>  when we do the split rate, which we've been doing for years, we've always shifted, and I voted for it, we've always shifted the burden from the residents to commercial, saying, well, they're a commercial business and they should pay more in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6195.81s">And</a>  I agree with that, Mr. President, but I think you get it to a point where <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6200.974s">The</a>  burden on the commercial, Mr. President, is having an impact on the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6206.118s">And</a>  when you see the percent of property in our community by value by class, almost 90% of the percent of levy <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6219.527s">that</a>  we derive from our income is for residential property, 90%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6227.233s">And</a>  then the commercial industrial make up 8.72%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6230.155s">So</a>  you can see over the years, the shift, we're losing a lot of the commercial base, which we rely on now because they pay a much higher tax rate and we're gaining more residential, which pays a lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6244.325s">And</a>  at some point, we as a community are going to make a tough decision and say we don't have enough of this commercial that we've been shifting the burden to, to support our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6255.113s">And</a>  I think that's going to be the question, Mr. President, that we're going to have to answer to eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6261.298s">And</a>  I think it's creeping around sooner than we expect, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6266.139s">The</a>  numbers, if you look at the single tax rate, which we haven't supported since I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6272.56s">If</a>  you look at the single tax rate, so that would be one tax rate for both commercial and residential, an average single family would pay $6,326. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6285.88s">And</a>  the average commercial business would pay $14,707. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6290.161s">So</a>  that's with one tax rate for both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6294.722s">Then</a>  you look at it, Mr. President, and if you were going to do a split rate, which we currently do, at 115%, the average single family would pay $6,215 and the average commercial would pay $6,915. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6311.068s">Then</a>  if you fast forward that into what we currently do is a split rate with 175% shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6316.869s">The</a>  average single family pays 5,768, so you can see it's decreased. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6318.87s">And</a>  the average commercial pays 25,737. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6320.93s">So</a>  they went with the single tax rate from 14,000 for commercial up to 25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6337.295s">And</a>  then if you split the rate at 115%, they went from 16,000 to 25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6343.721s">Those</a>  are huge jumps, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6347.664s">And</a>  if you look at, if we were to reverse this a little bit and look at shifting the burden to residential, the average single family at 175, at the single family rate, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6363.428s">The</a>  single rate would pay $6,000, and at the split rate would pay $6,215. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6367.569s">The</a>  difference, really, if we sat down and started going through this, because you're shifting it over so many different properties, it's not as big as the commercial side. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6381.014s">And</a>  I know it's not a popular thing to say, but if we're really serious about keeping commercial in this city, Mr. President, and expanding the commercial tax base, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6391.838s">I</a>  think we have to take a look at it at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6394.221s">And</a>  sometimes, you know, officials have to stand up and take tough votes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6399.486s">But</a>  I think it's something we have to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6401.829s">And,</a>  you know, it's probably not going to be this time, but I think next year I would request, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6409.256s">that</a>  we have meetings a month or two prior to the budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6415.457s">I'm</a>  sorry, the tax vote meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6418.298s">So</a>  we could start looking at the residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6420.939s">So</a>  we could start looking at the residential exemption that has been discussed about by area residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6430.081s">And</a>  give us enough lead time to make some informed decisions rather than tonight, which most of us, to be quite honest with you, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6440.604s">I</a>  hate to say it, our hands are tied, because this is based on the budget that we put forward and it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6448.452s">So</a>  I would ask Mr. President, under the leadership of yourself or whoever, as the Council of Vice President, Kaviel's the next president, that we have meetings well in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6461.185s">to</a>  when we set the tax rate so we can discuss some of the issues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6466.008s">As</a>  we heard tonight, I always thought that the tax rate was due at the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6470.71s">We</a>  heard that you could vote on it to have it done at the end of June, which gives you another six months of additional <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6479.335s">growth</a>  that you could use in a time of recession like we're seeing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6484.742s">That's</a>  six months that could add some new growth onto it and give us some additional revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6489.807s">And</a>  that's the lead time I think we need as a council to start discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6495.974s">I'm</a>  prepared to vote on this tonight, Mr. President, but I think, you know, we have to take a long, hard look at how we average out the property in our community and see if it makes sense to continue to shift the way we're shifting if we're really serious about keeping a commercial base in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6514.706s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6515.067s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6516.568s">Councilor</a>  Peers.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6518.169s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6519.189s">And</a>  thank you to Councilor Marks, Mr. Navarre, and to all my colleagues, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6525.914s">What</a>  we're talking about here are different ways of adjusting the distribution of the taxes that we currently assess on the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6534.257s">We've</a>  done the same thing for a long time, and we've seen some negative externalities on the commercial side, especially, that I think a lot of people don't like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6543.761s">So</a>  I think it is time to reassess. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6545.881s">Another</a>  piece of this, though, is the amount that we have to spend as a city on city services, which, as we all know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6553.455s">too</a>  low that every department is understaffed our schools and every city department doesn't have the resources it needs and I think in addition to exploring the residential factor and also I think the residential exemption there may be a combination of these tools with the distribution and the tools at our disposals to increase revenue that would allow us to <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6574.638s">have</a>  a just distribution for the people of Medford, commercial and residential both, property owners, as well as raising the revenue that we need, as I mentioned, and I essentially mentioned this during our budget conversation in June, to increase the revenue that we have for city services so that we can provide to the people of Medford the services that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6595.291s">And</a>  I think that's a conversation that's long overdue, so I hope that that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6600.939s">As</a>  part of the conversations around the tax rate and the budget, we can have an honest conversation about the unmet needs of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6608.223s">our</a>  community when it comes to city services, as well as the distribution of the tax assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6613.965s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6615.006s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6616.366s">And</a>  we discussed in our committee the whole earlier tonight about having a community hall meeting in March to kind of kick that off and talk about different options and to talk about the residential exemption and other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6632.513s">So</a>  in March, we'll be talking more about those topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6636.455s">Just</a>  to let you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6637.995s">Okay,</a>  so there was a motion on the floor, and that motion was offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, and the motion was, can you read that again, Councilor, Clerk Artavis?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6652.62s">The</a>  motion was to adopt the lowest residential factor possible to be used in 2021, which is 91.2072, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6658.122s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6660.223s">Ellen,</a>  that's correct, right?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6668.872s">Thumbs</a>  up, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6672.094s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6672.634s">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6673.635s">On</a>  that motion, Clerk Bernal, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6800.701s">Mr.</a>  President, before you call the roll.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6802.442s">Yes,</a>  sorry, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6805.584s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6806.845s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify that last year when we discussed the residential exemption, and I know Mr. Castagnetti has been a stalwart regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6819.393s">He</a>  says 10 years, I think he's been talking about this for 20 years, or at least it seems 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6825.86s">So</a>  long, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6828.222s">Last</a>  year when we discussed it, I think Councilor Knight brought up the fact that the numbers that we received that were the break even point for assessments over, I think it was 640,000 Councilor Knight mentioned, was a little over 2,000 households that were owner occupied, that lived in their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6848.022s">If</a>  we voted for residential exemption, because their property was assessed at over a certain amount of money, which was the break even point, they would still have to pay a higher tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6858.984s">And</a>  we were told there were about 2,000 properties in the community, that was last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6863.825s">And</a>  that's a number I've been monitoring over the years, because I think we as a council, I won't speak for anyone else, said if the numbers were falling, meaning that there were less and less people that fell in this range. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6876.507s">that</a>  were the exception to the rule that we may see favorable to vote on this and provide a property tax, a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6886.698s">We</a>  heard tonight, Mr. President, from the city assessor that they're saying now there's over 4,000 properties that are above the break even point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6897.148s">And</a>  in addition, out of the 4,000, 1,300 properties of people that are over the age of 60, which are seniors in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6906.933s">So</a>  these numbers are very staggering, Mr. President, and there may have been a discrepancy over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6913.877s">As</a>  we heard from the city's assessor, and I won't put words in her mouth, that they may have not been counting every type of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6922.245s">So</a>  they may have been just looking at single families and not condos or two families or multi-families. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6931.773s">So</a>  this number, in my opinion, is a little alarming that there's so many people that would fall out of the range of residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6941.576s">And</a>  I'm looking forward to discussions possibly in March regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6949.819s">actually</a>  taking a closer look at this and seeing if these are the true numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6954.042s">I</a>  think the city assessor made a commitment that she would revisit these numbers to see if they're true and accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6961.006s">But</a>  I just want Mr. Castagnetti and others to know that we do monitor this, we do keep an eye on this, and the numbers have fluctuated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6969.711s">And</a>  in this case, they fluctuated in a way that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6974.854s">I</a>  couldn't support at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6976.955s">There's</a>  just too many people, Mr. President, that would be impacted by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6981.739s">And</a>  I think the good outweighs the bad in this, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6986.543s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6987.724s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6988.745s">I</a>  just also want to add that it would be great to get figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6993.149s">We</a>  have kind of estimates right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=6994.87s">I</a>  think if we had that historical data, it would present a much clearer picture, as Councilor Marks indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7000.435s">But</a>  the flip side is that there are as many as 11,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7003.55s">properties</a>  that could benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7005.672s">So</a>  it's definitely a difficult decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7007.733s">That's</a>  our job is to make difficult decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7009.654s">But</a>  I think it's important that we talk about costs and benefits as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7014.918s">Probably</a>  many seniors who are in that 11,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7018.841s">So</a>  we really need to have the facts in front of us to make an informed decision on the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7024.245s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7025.005s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7027.698s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7028.618s">And</a>  just on Councilor Marks' point, Mr. President, looking at the math and the numbers that were put before us this evening, that 4,000 households looks like it represents about almost a quarter of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7040.584s">So</a>  that would be one in four paying more, even though they're owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7045.586s">And</a>  I think that's very important to point out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7047.147s">So,</a>  you know, I think that, you know, garbage in, garbage out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7050.348s">You</a>  can only make good decisions with good data. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7052.029s">And</a>  that's what we need to focus on.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7053.65s">You</a>  are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7055.373s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Carter please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7599.126s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7600.268s">I</a>  know that I had a great discussion with Mr. LaRusso, and I too received a lot of correspondence from our residents in supporting of a very fine and respected young man. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7616.828s">In</a>  our discussion, and I know Mr. LaRusso would speak on any question that people would like to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7623.632s">I</a>  know that the questions I had from people that were a little nervous about when you hear a tattoo parlor that's coming to your neighborhood, the things they fear are these frightening, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7637.981s">pictures</a>  of artwork that depict violence or sexual things in sexual nature and it really scares a community and I think that Mr. LaRusso and I had a great discussion and you know I believe he put it as his <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7657.443s">It</a>  sounds like an artist studio for the body, and understanding that it's by appointment only, that the building will be unassuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7665.765s">I</a>  think that the biggest questions that we talked openly about being across the street from the church, there might be some negative concerns with that, but he reiterated his deep faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7682.13s">And</a>  his support to the church and making sure that whatever he does as a business here in Medford, that it's done with class and with respect for that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7693.394s">And</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7696.627s">He</a>  hit all the buzzwords for me that you have a well-respected individual that has the total best interests of all of the neighbors and making sure that he is putting forth a classy and respected organization in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7719.009s">I</a>  know that we typically do move, request to move this to a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7726.852s">So</a>  we do hear from other residents in making sure that there's some concerns that if they had, they can listen to a very educated and eloquent individual. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7739.016s">can</a>  speak on behalf of his art prowess and realize that he is really, could be an important piece of not only the West Medford community, but I think a model for other neighborhoods that are looking to bring in the body art and the tattooing industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7757.749s">So,</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7759.271s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7760.231s">We</a>  have Councilor Morell, then Vice President Scarviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7763.373s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7764.274s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7764.554s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7764.794s">Mister</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7765.214s">If</a>  I could through the chair, just a question for Mister LaRusso. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7768.695s">There's</a>  those big, beautiful windows on the property there previously filled with antiques. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7773.497s">But</a>  I do know your neighbors, potential neighbors at Bistro 5 take a more kind of subdued approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7779.079s">The</a>  windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7779.519s">I'm</a>  just curious what you envision for those big if you wouldn't have that space.</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7794.69s">want</a>  to have anything flashy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7796.792s">I</a>  think one of the reasons why I'm opening a private studio, as opposed to continuing to work in a very well-respected tattoo shop, is to have something that is very small, very intimate, very unassuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7810.861s">And</a>  so I don't even plan on really putting much artwork in them, to be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7815.805s">There</a>  would be a sign with the name of the shop, but very simple, very clean, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7823.965s">And</a>  that would really be it.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7825.668s">OK,</a>  yeah, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7826.569s">I</a>  know and I know this is not what you're proposing, but I think some people's fears stem from the fact of thinking they someone's going to wander up to the window and pick out their tattoo and go inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7835.783s">So</a>  I appreciate you clarifying that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7839.159s">No,</a>  of course, and I totally understand where people's hesitations come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7845.163s">So</a>  again, any questions, I would definitely welcome them, because I want to make sure that not only am I granted so graciously the opportunity to do business Medford, but people know that I am going to be contributing as <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7862.95s">like</a>  an actual member of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7866.895s">It's</a>  hard for me to speak because I tend to be pretty humble, but I actually am a very well-respected and sought-after tattoo artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7875.886s">I</a>  have people traveling from <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7877.982s">New</a>  York to Florida to Chicago, I guess not right now because of COVID, but I tattoo members of the Patriots to members of the clergy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7888.091s">I</a>  work with a lot of different people and I have such a great opportunity to have such a great client list that the whole point of doing this for me is to again, do something that's very small, intimate, unassuming, relaxing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7901.843s">So</a>  people don't actually have to deal with a tattoo shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7904.704s">That's,</a>  you know, probably more of what you would think of like a very loud, buzzy place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7909.087s">This</a>  would be the complete opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7911.688s">Again,</a>  intimate, unassuming, small appointment only. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7915.109s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that that's clear.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7918.511s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7918.851s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7919.552s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7920.692s">We</a>  have Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7924.874s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7926.235s">And</a>  again, I'll reiterate what some of the other councilors have brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7933.755s">There's</a>  a church and a school right across the street from you, so if you could keep your establishment as tasteful and tactful as possible, that's about the only thing I can request of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7947.443s">I'd</a>  also like to, if we can get a report on the status of the other facility in West Leavitt that we voted on last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7957.57s">Are</a>  they coming? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7958.43s">Are</a>  they not coming? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7961.699s">and</a>  have that, so when we do have a community hall, we'll know what the status of that studio is also. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7968.082s">So</a>  if we can make that part of the paper, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7971.203s">Okay,</a>  so we'll make that, we'll have to do a B paper for that, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7976.445s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Caraviello, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7978.665s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7981.246s">Councilor</a>  Scott Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7982.707s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7984.137s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7985.277s">And</a>  I want to thank Mr. LaRusso for expressing interest in coming to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7991.399s">I</a>  just had a couple of really quick questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7995.02s">What</a>  would his staff consist of?</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=7997.261s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8000.201s">So</a>  it would be just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8002.162s">I</a>  would be the only working artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8004.503s">I</a>  have toyed around with the idea of possibly hiring a front desk person for a day or two during the week, more so to help with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8013.606s">So</a>  sending emails and whatnot, but that's another thing to share is that I would be the only sole artist. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8020.247s">So</a>  just me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8022.888s">And</a>  would your establishment consist of strictly tattooing or would it be body piercing as well?</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8031.57s">It</a>  would be strictly tattooing.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8033.83s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8035.151s">And</a>  I'm sure you're familiar. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8036.791s">You</a>  said you work for a current tattoo establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8042.858s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8043.619s">So</a>  I'm sure you're aware of all the proper protocols and procedures for the placement of syringes and needles and anything else associated with your business, blood and any other bodily fluids that are associated with your particular business.</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8066.108s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8067.328s">Very</a>  much so as a self-proclaimed germaphobe, I am very well aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8072.11s">And</a>  actually, uh, I was speaking with Sophie in the health department and actually had a couple of suggestions on, uh, ways to possibly update the health code and actually be even a little bit safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8082.693s">Um,</a>  I pride myself in not just creating good tattoos and a good experience, but third and just as important as those things, uh, a safe experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8091.756s">Um,</a>  because not only is it my reputation, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8093.996s">but</a>  it's also someone's health. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8095.657s">And</a>  I take that incredibly seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8097.818s">Um,</a>  and I pride myself in always watching when I'm in a tattoo space, things that could be improved upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8105.062s">That's</a>  something I take extremely seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8107.504s">Um,</a>  and would a hundred percent continue to do so, not just maintain status quo, but always improve and stay up to date on anything that's coming out in the industry that could make people safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8119.831s">I</a>  can a hundred percent assure you that is very important to me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8124.557s">And</a>  what would you anticipate your hours of operation to be in general?</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8129.879s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8130.819s">So</a>  it would probably be in the 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8133.92s">to</a>  6 p.m.-ish range. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8136.821s">I'm</a>  sure that if someday I ran a little bit late, maybe 7. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8141.102s">But</a>  not really early in the morning, because it's difficult to make appointments early. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8144.843s">And</a>  I tend not to like to work late. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8147.423s">So</a>  I would assume somewhere between 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8150.464s">and</a>  6 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8151.645s">with</a>  an hour, give or take.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8154.038s">Are</a>  we looking at how many days a week?</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8157.981s">Most</a>  likely four, but the possibility of five. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8162.824s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8163.344s">Currently</a>  four is what my preferred schedule is.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8167.327s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8167.967s">And</a>  if you were to know there was another establishment that existed within a hundred yards from your establishment that does the same type of tattooing, would that discourage you from going to this location?</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8181.628s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8183.229s">To</a>  be completely blunt, I don't really care if there's another tattoo shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8190.771s">Because</a>  of what I do is so specialized, and again, I may say so myself quite humbly, because I'm so sought after, I don't think it's really going to affect my business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8202.532s">The</a>  interactions I've had with the landlords of 507 High Street have been brilliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8208.717s">I've</a>  been really excited to not only be working with them, but be near folks like Wendy up the street at Sanctuary and Colin who spoke earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8220.056s">And</a>  so it wouldn't deter me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8224.319s">I</a>  tried to do a little bit of research, and I actually have never heard of them, which is strange because I'm pretty up-to-date on local tattoo communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8232.447s">So</a>  I'm sure I might reach out just to introduce myself, but that would be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8237.291s">Just</a>  like a friendly neighbor, hello.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8239.627s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8240.107s">And</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8242.389s">And</a>  the reason why I bring it up is because Council Vice President Caraviello brought up a very valid point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8248.094s">We,</a>  this council, approved a tattoo parlor, probably 100 yards, 200 yards from the establishment that you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8257.022s">And,</a>  you know, I think it's unfair that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8261.666s">that</a>  hasn't taken place yet, and most people have probably forgotten about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8266.21s">And</a>  here you are, a new establishment coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8268.452s">So</a>  I think it's important to know what may eventually, or already has been approved, but may eventually pop up next door to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8275.799s">Because</a>  people make business decisions based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8279.603s">A</a>  number of factors, and that could be one, proximity of other like establishments and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8284.868s">And</a>  maybe that's something we have to look at as a council when we issue a special permit that I believe, as Councilor Knight mentioned, and he'd probably know better than I, that it's good for up to a year, which sounds kind of excessive, to be quite honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8301.06s">And</a>  I think that opens up a lot of different doors when you have things hanging out there and you're not sure what may or may not go in there after approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8311.027s">So</a>  that's something we may want to look at as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8314.509s">And</a>  my last thing is I have to admit, I am a little jealous of Reverend Wendy's tattoo. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8320.893s">And</a>  if she's willing, maybe she could show us some more of her tattoos because that was pretty impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8331.08s">But</a>  I wish you well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8333.261s">And</a>  I wish you all but good luck.</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8336.063s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8336.763s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8338.389s">And</a>  if I may, just to add on to a comment you made, Councilor, I am 100% ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8346.535s">So</a>  obviously, I need to do a final health inspect walkthrough. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8350.618s">But</a>  other than that, I'm ready to get in there and start paying taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8354.621s">So</a>  if you folks will have me, I would love to be in there as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8359.825s">And</a>  I'm really, really excited to be part of the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8363.988s">I'm</a>  third generation Medfordian. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8367.12s">And</a>  this is very exciting for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8369.481s">So</a>  thank you for hearing me.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8371.941s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8372.661s">We</a>  have a couple more questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8373.922s">Councilor</a>  Knight, then Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8375.702s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8376.822s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8378.703s">Mr.</a>  LaRusso, thank you for coming this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8380.984s">I'd</a>  first like to start off by saying that your abilities nor is your character in question this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8388.565s">I</a>  got a phone call from a dear friend of mine, Chris Murphy, raving about your character and the type of person that you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8396.068s">And</a>  his opinion that you'd be a great fit in Medford, and that goes a long way with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8403.431s">You</a>  know, personal relationships that I have with individuals in the community and their opinion mean a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8410.237s">I'm</a>  certainly no prude, I have tattoos. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8412.479s">Not</a>  too happy that I got them when I was a young kid, but I got to live with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8415.621s">They're</a>  forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8417.043s">And</a>  I think that you're well aware of the concern that some people in the neighborhood have and some people in the parish have relative to the location of the studio and the aesthetics that may or may not be present there upon opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8431.585s">And</a>  I do have a specific request, and I'm hoping to be willing to entertain it, would be that you conduct a community meeting with the neighbors and with the residents in the parish. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8442.954s">To</a>  explain to them exactly what it is you're trying to do down there, and what direction you're looking to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8449.058s">I</a>  certainly have no issue with the tattoo shop in West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8452.88s">I</a>  voted for one just a couple weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8456.763s">I'm</a>  no prude by any means. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8458.724s">But</a>  there are certain concerns that have been raised by my neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8461.606s">I</a>  live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8462.346s">I</a>  live within walking distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8464.127s">I've</a>  heard about this application before I knew about it when it was coming across our table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8469.311s">And</a>  it's been an issue of concern for some of the residents that live down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8474.375s">So</a>  I'm asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8477.865s">with</a>  the hope that you'll be willing to conduct a community meeting or an open house of some sort to allow people to come down so you can explain to them what it is you're doing, what it is you're trying to do in the neighborhood, and address some of the concerns that may have arisen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8490.857s">Ultimately,</a>  because this is a special permit that's before the council, we do have the ability and the right to attach special conditions upon it, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8499.805s">I'm</a>  not thinking this is going to be a tattoo parlor that has vulgar pictures hanging in the windows right across the street from a church that just doesn't fly anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8508.932s">The</a>  days of those type of tattoos are over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8511.273s">This</a>  type of art form has transformed from bikers, veterans, and people in jail to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8518.578s">The</a>  barista at the Starbucks has a tattoo now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8521.4s">The</a>  Reverend in Sanctuary Church has a tattoo, everybody has tattoos. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8524.281s">They're</a>  commonplace, they're normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8526.861s">But</a>  that doesn't alleviate some of the issues that have been brought up to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8530.502s">So</a>  I'm asking that you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8532.223s">I'm</a>  on your own, I have no problem supporting this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8535.323s">However,</a>  I would ask that you at some point in time prior to opening, conduct just a small meeting with the residents and the neighbors and members of the parish to tell them what you're doing and to kind of explain to them what your aesthetics are going to be like so they don't have any fears as to any type of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8552.549s">Imagery</a>  that may be offensive to the practice of their faith.</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8557.437s">Of</a>  course, I would 100% <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8560.193s">not</a>  just be willing, but love to actively do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8563.336s">It</a>  sounds like, as you were saying, you're not just hearing things from other people, but you also live in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8570.221s">And</a>  if you would like to reach out, or I can reach out to you, maybe we could connect and you could help me get in touch with those folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8577.387s">And</a>  somehow we could set something up, whether it's in person or in Zoom, whatever people are most comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8583.693s">And</a>  I would love that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8585.534s">Because</a>  again, I don't want to just get in there and do business, but be some sort of a light in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8593.656s">I</a>  think that's something that's really important about art, and hence the name Last Light, is that art has always been something really important in humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8604.319s">It</a>  provides light. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8605.44s">It</a>  provides love and a reminder that we are all connected in some bigger way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8613.884s">I</a>  would be honored and love to have some sort of a either meeting, whether again, whether resume or whatnot with folks, not just to, uh, like, make them just just okay with it, but answer any questions and hopefully teach them something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8629.932s">That</a>  would be an awesome opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8631.933s">I'd</a>  love that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8634.254s">Mr.</a>  President, I just asked that we put a <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8636.452s">90-day</a>  review on it, just to be sure that the meeting happens and if any issues pop up, we can bring them back in and sit down and talk about what we can do to resolve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8646.46s">It's</a>  not a mechanism or a vehicle for us to come and yank your license away from you after three months or anything like that, Adam. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8651.945s">I</a>  don't want you worrying about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8653.286s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8653.866s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8654.246s">What</a>  it is is it's a mechanism for us to address some of the concerns that may come up during the first months of operation so that we can come up with a plan so that you can live harmoniously with the residents.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8664.214s">Of</a>  course.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8665.687s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8666.607s">So</a>  that is an amendment by Councilor Knight for a 90 day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8670.009s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8671.609s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8672.749s">Yeah,</a>  I just have one more question thinking about signage and this, I support this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8677.591s">So</a>  this is an kind of a inhibitor to that, but talking, so you mentioned signage in the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8683.593s">I</a>  know there's currently just kind of the larger signage on the facade that exists at the current space. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8690.276s">Do</a>  you imagine you'll be using that as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8692.456s">And</a>  will that, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8695.037s">I'm</a>  just trying to think out loud and understand what this might look like in total, assuming that other tattoo place also.</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8720.912s">day</a>  when I was speaking to the landlord about the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8725.453s">And</a>  just to clarify, like, above the glass, there's, like, bigger signs for every business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8731.534s">Is</a>  that what you're speaking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8732.475s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8732.875s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8734.475s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8735.255s">So</a>  I would put the last light name, but I was actually considering not putting Tattoo, because I thought it would be a little bit more <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8745.103s">Again,</a>  I think it's important for me to be unassuming, especially because it is appointment only. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8750.887s">It's</a>  actually probably going to be easier for me, especially it's appointment only, and I would be the only person working there, to not have a bunch of people knocking on the door or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8760.234s">I</a>  don't foresee that happening because I'm going to have proper signage in order to indicate to people that if they are interested to check out the website, that it is appointment only. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8769.948s">But</a>  I don't necessarily want to advertise that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8773.63s">I</a>  think I've done a great job with word of mouth and just my reputation to be able to advertise that I don't really need the sign to actually read tattoo. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8783.778s">So</a>  that was actually something that I was probably just going to skip over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8786.48s">And</a>  hopefully that also alleviates any concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8791.443s">you</a>  know, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8791.923s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8792.284s">I</a>  don't have any information about having like it obvious that there's another tattoo shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8795.165s">It</a>  would probably look more like somebody was driving by somewhere between like a yoga studio and an art gallery. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8801.789s">Um,</a>  not so much a tattoo shop by any means.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8804.771s">Okay,</a>  Great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8805.352s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8805.652s">And</a>  I thank you for entertaining that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8807.433s">I</a>  do support the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8808.734s">I</a>  just know that, you know, there may be questions that we get from the community later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8812.856s">It's</a>  just making sure I can address those properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8815.058s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8820.865s">And</a>  Adam, you didn't come here for business advice, but I'll give a little marketing advice anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8827.107s">Given</a>  your market, it might add to the brand exclusivity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8830.948s">So</a>  I think it might be a smart decision all around. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8833.849s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Lorusso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8835.73s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8836.43s">And</a>  that's part of the consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8838.551s">So</a>  I appreciate your encouragement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8840.351s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8841.292s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8843.332s">Okay,</a>  any other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8846.994s">Okay,</a>  we'll share away to motion.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8849.445s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8851.046s">OK,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight to approve as amended by Councilor Knight and seconded by Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8858.152s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8863.916s">Get</a>  Deacon Rumley to get a tattoo.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8866.298s">Mr.</a>  President, is there a B paper?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8867.599s">Sorry?</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8869.36s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello will have a B paper.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8870.681s">Call</a>  Deacon Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8871.282s">Oh,</a>  I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8871.922s">There's</a>  a B paper.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8874.104s">We</a>  have a B paper from you, so we have to go to that first. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8877.384s">You</a>  had a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8878.225s">We</a>  have to vote on that first.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8880.307s">The</a>  B papers for a report on the status of the other, uh, the other tattoo studio that the council approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=8884.891s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9031.777s">Tim</a>  was here.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9033.518s">Tim</a>  McGiven was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9034.619s">Let</a>  me see if he's... Oh, there he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9043.024s">Sorry,</a>  Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9048.108s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9048.688s">Tim,</a>  I'll unmute you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9052.53s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9053.191s">So</a>  we have a number of, and I believe we received a memo this week also from the city engineer regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9061.538s">was</a>  it point number 12? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9062.859s">Am</a>  I correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9065.861s">Do</a>  you want to talk to that, Tim?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9069.384s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9070.344s">So</a>  the memo was an update after the, I believe it was the first hearing with National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9077.93s">I</a>  spoke to MWRA shortly thereafter to go over the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9084.435s">And</a>  ultimately that ended up in a summary that is thus basically MWRA <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9092.675s">they</a>  need to start at the beginning of spring because of the nature of their project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9098.158s">So</a>  the lag time between when National Grid finishes their work and MWRA starts their work is going to be either eight months or 20 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9111.407s">So</a>  with that said, I revised my recommendation on number 12 to a mill and overlay restoration <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9122.48s">which</a>  would be pretty typical, you know, a 6 to 8 foot, 4 to 8 foot swath, depending on the pavement, for the run of the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9133.165s">So</a>  if there is that 20-month leg, we'll have a pavement that will last that 20 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9141.869s">So</a>  when MWRI comes in, obviously, they're going to dig the street up again, and then they'll resurface the whole thing, curb to curb.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9152.698s">Any</a>  of the cops have questions about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9155.219s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9164.322s">And</a>  I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9169.144s">So,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9170.645s">Cut</a>  the marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9172.112s">So</a>  last we left off, Mr. President, is that legal counsel from National Grid was going to speak to our acting city's solicitor regarding some mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9185.025s">And</a>  I'm very eager to hear what the results have been, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9190.112s">Thank</a>  you council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9191.013s">Diana,</a>  could you speak to that please? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9192.495s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9192.795s">Yes,</a>  of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9194.197s">Yes,</a>  we had a meeting on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9197.2s">Our</a>  legal counsel, our staff engineer that designed the project and is working with MWRA's project manager and Tim and the existing city solicitor, Kim Scanlon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9209.621s">And</a>  basically, Tim can correct me if I'm wrong, but we came under, came to the agreement that we will do the, National Geographic will do the video inspection of where our proposed work is going over the city's infrastructure to use as a baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9229.025s">And</a>  then once we'll review that over the winter and work with <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9233.785s">to</a>  see what the next steps would be, whether that's if we have the spot open, they come in and repair something that's in disrepair. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9242.109s">Anything</a>  we break, of course, we would fix if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9246.372s">And</a>  then we understand the paving because of the lag time now with MWRA, that we would do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9253.495s">They</a>  would have reimbursed us for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9258.158s">And</a>  then I guess beyond that, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9263.17s">requesting</a>  that the council be amenable to removing the remaining conditions that, so that the ones that are above and beyond that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9275.68s">And</a>  the city solicitor was in agreement with us.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9280.584s">So,</a>  Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9283.166s">So,</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9286.675s">I'm</a>  a little disappointed that we've waited this long to get that answer, because that answer does not address what this Medford City Council has requested in regards to mitigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9301.148s">And</a>  if we have to rehash this, I'm willing to go over it again tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9305.512s">But</a>  this council requested that some mitigation be put forth by either the MWRA or National Grid <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9313.96s">regarding</a>  the curbing on that stretch of Riverside F. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9319.738s">And</a>  we were told that originally they weren't willing to do the whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9324.761s">I</a>  think this council stood up and said, we're not looking for you to do the whole project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9329.024s">We're</a>  looking for you to set aside some money that we as a community can put into bringing the curbs up higher than the street, where much of the curbing is level with the road and very dangerous for pedestrian safety in that particular area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9348.515s">And</a>  now we're hearing that as part of this project, it could be a lag of up to eight to 20 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9357.721s">So</a>  they may start the spring of 2021 and not finish for 20 months out, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9364.566s">And</a>  what they'll do is put down a binary code, coding, whatever it is, so that we can ride on it for 20 months while it looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9377.795s">you</a>  know, a pile of you know what. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9381.318s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9383.42s">This</a>  makes zero sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9385.322s">Why</a>  would we want, as a community, want to sit on a construction site for 20 months? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9390.547s">And</a>  the residents that have to live there, Mr. President, when they open their door and face that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9397.154s">It</a>  just makes no sense to me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9399.455s">I'm</a>  very disappointed that National Grid's not willing to step up, Mr. President, on a project of this size and help out the community in regards to mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9412.02s">They</a>  pay mitigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9414.782s">There's</a>  no bones about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9417.063s">Legal</a>  or not legal, they pay mitigation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9420.762s">So</a>  if that's the case tonight, they don't have my vote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9425.464s">They're</a>  not going to move forward with my vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9427.344s">Other</a>  members of the council may see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9429.445s">But</a>  we got zero out of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9433.046s">Nothing</a>  but inconvenience for the residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9436.588s">And</a>  don't forget, this started out with doing construction during the holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9441.79s">And</a>  then they pushed it a little further back. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9444.531s">And</a>  now we're hearing there could be a 20-month lag in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9448.985s">How</a>  does that benefit us? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9451.625s">Benefits</a>  their schedule, the MWRA and National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9455.086s">How</a>  does that benefit the city of Medford on a major thoroughfare in our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9460.847s">It</a>  doesn't, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9462.307s">And</a>  if they're not willing to sit down and talk mitigation, they don't have this council's support. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9467.108s">And</a>  I hope my other council colleagues stand up too, Mr. President, on what's right on behalf of this community and its residents.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9474.87s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9475.49s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9477.591s">Councilor</a>  Bears and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9479.512s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9493.197s">Tim,</a>  do you want? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9494.977s">Mitigation,</a>  in my opinion, is like mitigating something that, restoring it back to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9502.747s">it's</a>  original condition or acceptable condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9506.688s">So</a>  we are, because of the MWRA's lag in getting in right behind us, there's a, hopefully, it won't be the 20 months, but, so we would restore, the street would just be like a typical main relay where we would come back in, restore the pavement to the condition that it was in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9525.502s">before</a>  or a little better. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9527.923s">And</a>  then they would come back in after us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9529.563s">They</a>  would do their work and then, you know, they would do the curb to curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9534.985s">And</a>  the benefit would be, you know, the city has new infrastructure there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9540.447s">The</a>  MWRA has, I'm not exactly sure on their exact details of the project, but Tim can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9547.37s">So</a>  there are some benefits to the city for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9551.628s">I</a>  just wanted to mention again, we were asked to move our stuff for the MWRA to come in and do this major project that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9559.8s">So,</a>  you know, we're being driven by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9565.227s">This</a>  wasn't a main relay we were anticipating.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9568.517s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9572.678s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9574.039s">My</a>  definition of mitigation may be a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9578.521s">Restoring</a>  back to how it was is a given. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9581.822s">That's</a>  what happens on every utility project in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9585.903s">Every</a>  utility project, they're required to return it back to the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9590.606s">Mitigation</a>  is going over and above, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9593.447s">We're</a>  asking over and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9595.068s">We're</a>  not asking to restore the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9597.349s">That's</a>  how every project is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9600.039s">So</a>  I'm not, I think our definition is a little different, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9604.322s">And,</a>  you know, it doesn't matter to me that National Grid's stepping in on behalf of, because they have to move their utility so the MWRA could do what they, it doesn't matter to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9616.772s">They're</a>  both utilities, Mr. President, and they both should step up to the plate and assist this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9623.197s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9624.638s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9626.899s">Councilor</a>  Bears, you had the floor.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9628.0s">Just</a>  to answer, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9629.253s">to</a>  get an answer to the question, what's the difference between the cost of the full curb-to-curb resurfacing and the patching that you will be doing?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9640.222s">The</a>  difference in cost, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9644.686s">Mr.</a>  McGibbon has an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9645.927s">I</a>  mean, I can give you an estimate.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9650.591s">Yeah,</a>  back with an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9652.5s">We're</a>  talking about the difference between milling and overlay, the full width of the road, which is 20 some odd feet, versus milling and overlay, the trench patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9662.986s">So</a>  the trench patch mill and overlay is somewhere between typically five and eight feet, depending on the condition of the pavement surrounding it and how close or not to the curb it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9672.31s">So</a>  I can't give you a cost estimate based off of this information that I'm telling you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9679.418s">I'd</a>  have to take a much closer look at it and what would be required. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9684.262s">If</a>  full rebuilds need to happen in places when they do the final resurfacing, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9687.724s">Are</a>  we talking a million dollars, $100,000, $50,000?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9689.585s">We're</a>  not talking seven-figure million dollars worth of work, no.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9701.258s">The</a>  order of magnitude is more than double if that's helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9706.52s">So</a>  more than double the cost for a full resurface versus less than half of the width of the roadway.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9712.763s">But</a>  either way, it would be under a million dollars.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9716.045s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9716.765s">Yeah,</a>  I think it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9718.246s">I</a>  think it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9718.887s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9719.607s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9720.167s">And</a>  Miss Cuddy, what was the annual profit of National Grid last year?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9727.223s">I</a>  think it's something like 90% into renewable, like figuring out better ways to do zero carbon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9739.37s">I</a>  don't know what their net profit or gross profit was, though.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9743.713s">I</a>  think it's in the billions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9745.434s">And</a>  then where is National Grid headquartered? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9747.436s">The</a>  international headquarters?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9750.219s">In</a>  Waltham, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9751.6s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9751.8s">But</a>  I did want to say that... No, where is National Grid headquartered internationally?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9759.827s">The</a>  headquarters is in Waltham, Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9762.329s">But</a>  where is the corporate ownership? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9763.83s">Where</a>  do they live? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9764.491s">England.</a> </p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9767.412s">We're</a>  owned through the UK, but the corporate headquarters is in Waltham, Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9772.614s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9772.854s">So</a>  there's like billions of dollars in profits from a foreign company, and we can't spend less than a million dollars on a street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9779.136s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9781.357s">Mr.</a>  Councilor Bears, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9784.298s">So</a>  again, Mr. President, I'm sorry we're going down this hole again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9789.44s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9789.8s">Cuddy</a>  seems to be the spokesperson that has to take the brunt of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9796.228s">I</a>  find it amazing that it has to be National Grid that comes before us because of an MWA problem that then reflects back to a National Grid problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9809.443s">Why</a>  aren't we sitting together with National Grid, I mean with MWRA? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9815.668s">Why</a>  don't we have all of the parties together in a room that they can understand what the constituents, what the residents of Riverside Ave have been hearing that is absolutely frightening them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9828.059s">The</a>  understanding that close to two years they're going to look at a major <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9834.131s">major</a>  concerns that they're going to be dealing with for 20 months, possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9839.033s">So</a>  this is why I can't support this, because we still haven't gotten the answers for this Councilor to go back to the constituents that live on Riverside Ave and talk to those people and say, we've dotted all the I's and crossed all the T's, and this is what we're going to have, and this is what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9859.439s">Because</a>  this is a major project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9862.499s">So</a>  I don't know if Tim can answer this, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9865.68s">Cuddy,</a>  I'm sorry, but we haven't talked to any representative from the MWRA and this community gives a lot of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9876.074s">And</a>  we need to get their representatives here so we can talk to them and say, what are we doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9881.855s">Why</a>  can't this be done simultaneously? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9884.416s">Why</a>  can't we look at the mitigation for the curbs where it's a city, it's MWRA, it's National Grid working together to make sure that we can use all three entities to fix a problem that could go away if there's a way to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9901.14s">Maybe</a>  it's not a million dollars for National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9903.978s">Maybe</a>  it's a third. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9905.298s">Maybe</a>  it's a third for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9906.759s">Maybe</a>  it's a third for MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9908.48s">But</a>  we haven't talked about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9910.12s">All</a>  we keep trying to do is push the same 13, 14 points that keep coming back that's not appeasing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9917.543s">Forget</a>  about me, because honestly, I live in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9922.324s">I</a>  live in the Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9924.245s">The</a>  people that are there every single day, that when they heard 20 months now, is absolutely frightening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9931.267s">So</a>  can anybody speak to that?</p>

    <p>[Diana Cuddy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9934.124s">So</a>  yes, I can say our portion of the project, we would be done in six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9939.306s">So</a>  we would start excavation, do the main relay and do the paving that Tim mentioned in six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9947.85s">The</a>  other piece I just wanted to mention is, and if you wanted to see the letter that our legal counsel set up, it cites, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9957.088s">SJC</a>  state law that, so this type of project, because this isn't a new main, it's a main replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9965.654s">These</a>  costs go back to the rate payers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9967.696s">They</a>  go into the rate case and we are legally obligated to keep, to not have like above and beyond what the cost of the construction is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9979.864s">So</a>  it's a legal obligation on our part for this particular type of work.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9985.883s">Well,</a>  and I can understand what you have to do for your position, but you also have to understand what I have to and we have to do in our positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9993.829s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=9993.989s">Cuddy,</a>  Tim, I think, what conversations, what discussions have we had with the MWRA that is this something that we can do? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10005.637s">We're</a>  talking about a 20 month project that has to be approved by an organization, National Grid, that's saying they're only going to be here for six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10013.563s">It</a>  seems like they're going to be in and out, but then the other organization that has nothing to do with this permit right now, it's going to take 20 months possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10022.514s">Can</a>  you help us so we can answer the questions to those residents?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10028.576s">to</a>  the chair, it's not a 20-month project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10031.237s">It's</a>  a 20-month leg. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10033.097s">So</a>  they need to be able, MWA needs to start in the beginning of the construction season so they can complete by the end of the construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10043.44s">So</a>  their start time for the year is a spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10046.861s">So</a>  if it's not next spring, eight months away, then it's the following spring after that, 20 months, and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10056.531s">It's</a>  just a lag, it's not the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10058.614s">So</a>  during those 20 months, there's no construction happening on the streets.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10061.658s">Okay,</a>  so that's the fear that when you hear, now to a traffic engineer, a lag sounds perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10069.947s">To</a>  Mrs. Smith, who lives on Riverside Ave, who's 74 years old, that only place to park is her driveway, Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10077.211s">This</a>  is what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10078.011s">I'm</a>  not trying to cause any, I'm not trying to be negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10080.612s">I'm</a>  trying to find a way that we can say, okay, so the way it sounds, it's coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10085.995s">National</a>  Grid's going to do six weeks of work, rip up the road, leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10090.157s">And</a>  just go over it with overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10092.979s">And</a>  then the residents are going to have to deal possibly up to 20 months with delays with this type of road that they have to drive on, walk on every single day.</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10105.746s">President,</a>  I can address that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10107.267s">Yes,</a>  please, Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10108.848s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10109.328s">So</a>  the service restoration that National Grid would do under this scenario, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10117.18s">From</a>  my understanding of Riverside Ave, I've driven it a couple times recently to understand a little bit better for these conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10124.623s">It</a>  would be significantly better than what's even there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10128.244s">So</a>  I think doing a grind and an overlay, that's a legitimate resurfacing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10134.386s">So</a>  that lane or half of Riverside that is done after National Grid does their six weeks of work, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10143.886s">It's</a>  not just, it's going to hold up for the 20 months plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10149.769s">I</a>  mean, that's what usually we would see for final restoration on some streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10154.63s">So</a>  it's kind of up there with final restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10157.312s">It's</a>  just not the whole road, because it wouldn't make sense, really, to have National Grid do a curb-to-curb mill and overlay. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10165.215s">Because</a>  MWRA is coming back at some point in the beginning of A spring to open up pits so they can do their line project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10173.757s">And</a>  things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10174.437s">So</a>  that 20 months, there's no construction during that 20 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10179.438s">Say</a>  that the lag is 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10181.239s">It</a>  could be shorter than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10182.139s">It</a>  could be eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10183.099s">But</a>  if it is 20, then we'll have a street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10186.6s">It's</a>  not going to be the pothole-ridden street that we might be envisioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10191.441s">It's</a>  going to be nice, smooth pavement or a chunk of it, the chunk that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10196.393s">So</a>  that piece is going to be nicer than the rest of Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10201.836s">But</a>  unfortunately, then MWR will come in and dig it up, and then grind it, and then repay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10207.879s">So</a>  just to set expectations, that 20 months, that's not construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10213.702s">That's</a>  just regular Riverside Avenue.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10216.223s">OK,</a>  so thank you for clarifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10219.025s">Like</a>  I said, that's one of the biggest questions I've been fielding. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10222.046s">And</a>  I think I concur with Council Marks <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10226.55s">Maybe</a>  there is, have we had a discussion with all three entities to say, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10231.753s">Cutty</a>  says that the amount of mitigation with how much money they're putting into it, it doesn't equate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10238.738s">But</a>  has there been discussion where the three entities have worked together to try to fix a wrong that is Riverside Ave curbing? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10247.604s">Just</a>  in that, especially for me, that locust turn and probably up to the next, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10256.119s">The</a>  next intersection, the next street, like I said, I don't think it's monumental. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10261.845s">I</a>  don't think it's all 1,400 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10265.389s">So</a>  again, I'd like to hear, we could have that conversation to try to fix that wrong, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10274.9s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10275.621s">Scarpelli,</a>  Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10278.445s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10281.306s">Over</a>  the last few weeks, we've been beating this back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10284.547s">I</a>  kind of feel bad for National Grid, because this isn't their project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10289.909s">It's</a>  an MWRA project, and MWRA is nowhere to be seen or heard for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10295.59s">I</a>  say we don't have any more discussions on this until the MWRA comes up, steps up to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10302.323s">I</a>  mean, again, they're doing this at the request of the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10308.526s">This</a>  isn't their project, and we're killing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10313.409s">It's</a>  really not fair, and I say at the next meeting that this go no further until the MWRA officials come before us, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10326.116s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10329.297s">Mr.</a>  President, the notes I have say, I said, why don't we move to have a committee of the whole with the MWRA and National Grid over the project and mitigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10336.02s">I</a>  mean, ultimately, National Grid wouldn't even be here if it wasn't because MWRA asked them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10340.322s">And</a>  as I looked at the heat map just a couple weeks ago, the map that allows us to take a look at the gas leaks in the area, we've had a significant number of gas leaks along that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10350.446s">That</a>  we're going to remain on that street is gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10352.547s">National</a>  Grid admittedly had no intention of coming down there and repairing any of those unless they really had to, unless they were grade one gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10359.47s">You</a>  know, so I'm looking at this project and I'm saying to myself, you know, National Grid was never going to come here unless MWRA asked them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10369.516s">Now</a>  that they're coming here, they are going to make repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10372.058s">Okay,</a>  that's all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10373.359s">But</a>  this isn't about the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10374.599s">This</a>  is about mitigation to the residents in the neighborhood that are going to be forced to put up with the construction that's going on down there, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10380.623s">So</a>  the one question I do have would be for the city engineer and it's, you know, is there a code relative to <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10388.692s">a</a>  safety code or a building code or a construction code relative to sidewalk and curving height in relation to the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10397.055s">And</a>  if there is, when we're allowing these public utilities to come in our community and restore them to equal or better condition, we're really letting them come in and establish something that's not up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10413.545s">I</a>  mean, if someone were to come into this building, when we built the new police station, we had to make sure that it met the seismic requirements that were necessary for a building of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10421.954s">We</a>  had to take into consideration the floodplain and all these different other items when we were building a new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10428.161s">When</a>  we renovate buildings, we talked about the renovation of certain homes in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10433.887s">And</a>  we have to bring those homes up to code when they're given a building permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10437.31s">So</a>  I guess my question is, is there a code relative to sidewalk height in relation to the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10441.853s">And</a>  why are we allowing public utilities to come into our community and restore them to the condition they were in and not up to code if there is in fact a code? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10449.419s">Which</a>  there probably isn't, that's why we're letting them do it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10452.521s">Tim,</a>  would you be able to address that?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10455.424s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10456.024s">Thank</a>  you, President DeFranco. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10457.845s">So</a>  there is codes associated with ADA accessibility <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10461.887s">And</a>  there's also guidance and all kinds of case law. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10466.19s">So</a>  if something is not to code and it's within reason for them to fix it, a utility company that exposes it, say, for example, there's a sidewalk panel that's cracked and it doesn't have a pimple pad on it, which a lot of people call those truncated combs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10485.842s">Then,</a>  yes, we would ask that when they put the sidewalk panel back, that they install one of those to bring it up to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10493.525s">So</a>  it's a question of reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10495.086s">So</a>  when we look at it and we say, this infrastructure is getting dismantled. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10499.748s">When</a>  they put it back, is there anything reasonable that they should be doing to get it up to code? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10506.09s">Now,</a>  of course, there's nuances to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10509.131s">So</a>  existing conditions fall under the code as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10517.218s">But</a>  to repair those slopes would have you chasing grades up the street, for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10522.864s">That</a>  could be deemed unreasonable, and at an expense above and beyond what would be considered reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10527.813s">what</a>  the legal obligations of the utility entity are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10531.794s">So</a>  we do look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10533.595s">So</a>  for this particular situation, and I know we have talked about it in previous hearings, the city is looking at opportunities to improve this particular block of curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10545.199s">I've</a>  looked at it a couple times now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10547.92s">So,</a>  you know, there is, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10550.807s">And</a>  I've also been looking at what the obligations are, what the rules are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10555.409s">And</a>  Councilor Knight, as you know, I have community mitigation on my to-do, and we're trying to figure out how to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10564.992s">But</a>  just from a straight opening the street and then returning the street, we do have statutes to work from, and we do have understandings of what's reasonable and what's not reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10575.515s">And</a>  those are the lenses that we really try to look at these projects when we're trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10580.877s">to</a>  ask for certain things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10583.719s">And</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10585.401s">Can</a>  we get it to code, ADA code, pretty reasonably in the project if they're opening it up anyway? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10594.187s">Or</a>  is it something where it's unreasonable to bring it up to code? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10597.29s">So</a>  we are, of course, looking at that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10601.673s">If</a>  they're not working the sidewalk and the sidewalk needs design work and it has rippling implications for raising it, then we do need to go through a design effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10613.377s">We</a>  do need to take a look at what all the implications are of that particular stretch of curbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10622.24s">So</a>  it is definitely not as easy as just <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10625.725s">raise</a>  the curb and make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10628.546s">It</a>  requires some careful design. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10630.927s">And</a>  there isn't a code that says what height the curb should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10634.128s">It's</a>  more of standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10635.748s">So</a>  the city has a set book of standards that we look at when anybody does any road work in the city that we're going to ask them to meet.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10645.093s">And</a>  in terms of the gorilla in the room, the elephant in the room, whatever you want to call it, MWRA, have you sat down with MWRA and discussed the further criteria of the mitigation agreement or the requests and recommendations that your office has related to their project when they come on board? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10664.823s">Or</a>  is this still a little premature for that?</p>

    <p>[Tim McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10668.684s">It's</a>  not premature. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10669.885s">So</a>  we have been talking to MWRA about this project for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10674.563s">We've</a>  met with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10676.165s">I</a>  don't know if we've actually had all three entities, City of MWRA and National Grid, all in the same meeting or call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10682.55s">But</a>  we have been referring to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10684.992s">And</a>  the bulk of the conversation with MWRA has been what their scope of their project is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10691.057s">It's</a>  not just Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10692.479s">It's</a>  a couple of other places in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10694.899s">And</a>  also, too, the restoration work that MWRA is providing, they've worked with us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10704.462s">Again,</a>  they fall under the same set of obligations as any other utility company opening on our streets.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10711.545s">Mr.</a>  President, I think at this point, I'm very comfortable echoing the sentiments of Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello that <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10721.605s">The</a>  city engineer just said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10723.046s">These</a>  three parties haven't even been in the same room. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10725.929s">So</a>  I would suggest an offer in the way of a motion that we have a committee of the whole with the MWRA National Grid, as well as representatives from the administration to discuss this permit and mitigation.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10736.299s">On</a>  that motion, I'll provide Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10738.001s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10738.822s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarapelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10743.607s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10757.647s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10758.587s">Sending</a>  the affirmative, zeroing the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10760.849s">This</a>  motion passes and I will schedule a committee to hold <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10767.32s">If</a>  not, it might be President Capiello that does it in the next term, just because we're running out of time in the month of December. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10775.284s">But</a>  we will schedule a committee to hold on this, hopefully sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10780.667s">On</a>  the main paper, is there a motion to put on the table, or? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10786.77s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of council, I'll ask to table the main paper, seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10793.503s">Seconded</a>  by Vice President Caraviello, Clerk Hurtubise. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10796.846s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise, please come to the hall.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10800.748s">So</a>  you've moved the committee to the hall, and you're tabling the main paper until it comes out? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10805.271s">Is</a>  that the resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10806.012s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10806.852s">Councilor</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10807.913s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10809.854s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10811.976s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10812.596s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10813.417s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10818.22s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10818.44s">Seven</a>  in favor of adjournment, I get the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10826.241s">It</a>  was cut to a mark seconded by Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10836.552s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions 20-660 offered by Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10841.335s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council request a briefing on the administration's newly established commission on parking policy and enforcement from the chairs of the commission, Jim Silva and Laurel Ruma, and be provided an explanation of the purpose of the commission as well as the due date for the commission's findings report.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10861.69s">Councilor</a>  Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10862.897s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10864.099s">I</a>  believe this paper speaks for itself, and I'll let the chair speak soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10867.863s">And</a>  I apologize that the second item on the agenda took us till 10 o'clock to get to, but I know they're very much used to these meetings, so I thank them for their patience. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10876.714s">But</a>  I'm the council rep on this commission, and there's a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10881.239s">community</a>  members and business owners who've been working very hard, regular meetings, weekly meetings, and doing a lot of work out in the community to move forward a number of issues around this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10891.726s">I'll</a>  hand it over to Jim and Laurel to speak on this more.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10895.808s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10901.216s">If</a>  I may, one minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10901.937s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10903.077s">Just</a>  a couple of weeks ago, Mr. President, a similar item came upon the agenda and we discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10908.838s">It's</a>  very important when we get updates from bodies, boards, commissions, the administration, that these updates are provided to us in writing so that we have that snapshot in time so that when the item comes up again at a later date, we have something to compare it to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10921.68s">And</a>  I'd hope that that still stands.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10924.601s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10925.889s">So</a>  if you're going to give us an update tonight, could you also please give it to us in writing? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10932.435s">That</a>  would be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10936.038s">Just</a>  so we have, I guess, a point of reference as to what we spoke at during the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10943.466s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10944.366s">So</a>  my name is Laurel Ruma, 149 Burgett Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10948.108s">And</a>  just for clarification, this is the first time we've been before the council on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10952.111s">So</a>  this is an establishment of the commission, not necessarily an update, but going forward, it's noted and we will provide them in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10961.716s">My</a>  co-chair is Jim Silva.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10965.478s">Jim</a>  Silva, 115 Yale street.</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10968.36s">And</a>  the two of us have been appointed by the mayor to develop a, as well as other members of the commission and the purpose of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10977.295s">the</a>  Parking Policy and Enforcement Commission is to go by her purposes of establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10989.078s">And</a>  so for the purpose of the record, it'd be good to go over her founding of this commission and why. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=10996.439s">And</a>  this is all public record, but again, we'll put it in the package for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11001.555s">Mayor's</a>  Commission on Parking Policy and Enforcement, I hereby establish this committee, the Mayor's Commission on Parking Policy and Enforcement, for the following purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11010.682s">One,</a>  to evaluate the City of Medford's current policies pertaining to on-street parking in residential, commercial, and industrial areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11019.108s">Two,</a>  to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of area-wide parking policies as it relates to the MBTA Green Line Extension, scheduled to open late 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11029.773s">Three,</a>  to study the fees currently assessed for on-street parking in the city of Medford, including meters, passes, and permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11037.139s">Four,</a>  to study the methods of parking fee collection in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11041.102s">Five,</a>  to evaluate the city of Medford's current arrangement of parking enforcement to wit the outsourcing of parking administration and enforcement to a third party vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11049.448s">And</a>  six, to make recommendations of the policy changes to her honor the mayor if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11057.554s">the</a>  following individuals are the designees of applicable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11061.076s">One</a>  resident appointed by the Mayor to serve as chairperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11064.337s">You</a>  get two. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11066.538s">No</a>  fewer than three residents and or business owners of the City of Medford appointed by the Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11069.999s">A</a>  member of City Council, which is Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11071.5s">A</a>  member of City Council, which is Councilor Lueb. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11074.95s">and</a>  the chief of police of Medford and or his designee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11079.592s">City</a>  staff shall be made available to the commission to assist with completing this charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11083.213s">The</a>  commission is directed to begin work immediately and submit a report to the mayor with the recommendations by March 31st, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11090.716s">This</a>  was signed by the mayor, October 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11094.857s">And</a>  from that point on, Jim Silva and I have been part of this commission and the members of the commission are the following people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11104.846s">Um,</a>  many who are still on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11106.948s">Thank</a>  you all very much for being here, including Morgan Carroll, Pam Cirillo, D.J. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11112.292s">Benigno,</a>  Nicole Morell, Jeffrey Mung, Saketh Rama, Fred Roche, myself, Laurel Siegel, and Jim Silva. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11123.741s">And</a>  the Police Department representative has been Sergeant Hartnett, um, as well as at times the chief himself, which has been very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11132.41s">So</a>  our charges as the commission is to look at what the current parking situation is now, how it can be improved for both business districts and residential, as well as the fees, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11145.594s">So</a>  we are currently meeting every Wednesday at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11149.475s">We</a>  welcome any public input to these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11154.506s">We</a>  have divided ourselves up into two committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11157.148s">One</a>  committee is focused on residential, one on commercial business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11162.353s">And</a>  the status so far of the residential meeting has been to reach out to neighboring communities to get an understanding of their parking situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11173.538s">We</a>  are a differing and complex community, as we all know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11179.28s">The</a>  important part about the Mayor's charge is to really look at the areas that are surrounding the MBTA, the new Greenline stations that are coming in, and that's at College and Boston Avenue near Tufts University, as well as Ball Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11194.445s">So</a>  although we are not only looking at those two geographic areas, we are looking at the rest of Medford for residential <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11205.579s">that</a>  our main concentration is this area, which we are, as Jim and I are also the mayoral appointees for the Greenline Extension Committee, as well, greatly concerned that these particular neighborhoods will be severely impacted by folks coming in to take the T to town eventually. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11225.545s">The</a>  business committee subcommittee is doing this excellent work, talking to businesses that have ideas and brainstorming and various suggestions on what to do about business parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11240.737s">They</a>  have also, we have also all created this survey that we have sent out to businesses through the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11248.279s">This</a>  is now publicly available on the City of Medford's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11252.321s">We</a>  strongly encourage all businesses to take the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11255.142s">We</a>  are actively looking for feedback from every single business in the City of Medford, whether or not you are in a parking center, whether or not you have a meter in front of your business or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11265.785s">We</a>  do want to hear from as many businesses as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11269.306s">As</a>  you can imagine, the pandemic has made it difficult to reach out, you know, meeting as many people as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11276.973s">So</a>  what we're trying to do here is reach out through public forums, such as the City Council on the City of Medford's website, as well as through the Chamber and basically handing out flyers where it's safe and applicable to talk to businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11295.136s">We</a>  will also be doing a residential parking survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11298.059s">So</a>  we do want all residents of Medford, whether you have a business or not, whether you own a house or not, we would love to hear everyone's opinions about the current parking situation in Medford and how it can be made better. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11310.491s">The</a>  link to the survey is available on the City of Medford's website, and I'll stop here if anyone has any questions for Jim or I.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11323.87s">Councilor</a>  Morell and Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11326.212s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11327.293s">Laurel,</a>  do you know where specifically on the website the link to that survey could be found?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11331.156s">Yeah,</a>  so it was just posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11335.559s">So</a>  it's on the city news announcements from December 4th, but the title is Mayor's Commission on Parking Policy Enforcement Seeking Business Input via Survey.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11345.146s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11345.687s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11347.16s">Councilor</a>  Morell, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11349.621s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11350.741s">And</a>  I want to thank the two chairs, Laurel and Jim, for their dedication to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11357.283s">They've</a>  been involved with a lot of different projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11360.384s">And</a>  this project is a big undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11364.925s">I</a>  sat on the original parking enforcement committee back some, I don't know, probably 10 years ago now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11371.427s">And</a>  at that time, it was a large undertaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11373.968s">And</a>  they're taking on, in addition, the Green Line extension and some other issues that city-wide permit parking and some other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11382.11s">My</a>  question to the two chairs is, if someone's interested in a particular subject, as you know, there's a lot involved with from enforcement to districts to meters or kiosk and how we're going to enforce things. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11399.516s">If</a>  someone is just interested in one aspect, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11403.757s">How</a>  do they know when that will be brought up? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11406.197s">Are</a>  they allowed to get onto the Wednesday meetings and just bring up any subject, or is there an agenda that you follow and talk about just certain items? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11416.259s">How</a>  does that work?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11418.72s">Thanks,</a>  Councilor, because we are acting on behalf of the mayor as a city commission, we do have public meetings with public schedules posted ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11428.101s">We</a>  offer time at the end of the meetings for any public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11431.675s">So</a>  honestly, we are not progressing in a linear form. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11435.478s">We</a>  are sort of taking all issues as they come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11439.021s">It</a>  sounds like a massive undertaking, but we only have three months to complete our report as of now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11443.485s">So</a>  if anyone is interested in any of those particular issues, whether it is meters or private ways, we are welcome to come in and bring it to the commission pretty much at any time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11459.961s">So</a>  how, as a commission, are you publicizing your meetings and are they well attended over the last, you know, several weeks since you've been meeting?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11471.67s">Meetings</a>  are posted on the city website or the event calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11475.773s">I</a>  would say no, probably folks don't know that we are operating it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11481.036s">There's</a>  a lot of commissions going on in the city right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11483.738s">And</a>  we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11486.428s">just</a>  looking to pretty much get our name out there as well and really encourage folks that are interested in parking to come to the meetings and or reach out to Jim and I. We have all of the contact information also available.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11501.231s">So</a>  is the expectation at some point that you're going to have, you know, like a full-blown public hearing where residents will be invited to hear recommendations and give input? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11517.084s">Is</a>  that the ultimate?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11520.567s">It's</a>  possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11522.688s">You</a>  know, it's within the realm of possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11525.99s">I</a>  would say right now we're very focused on getting as much information as possible for the recommendation for the mayor's report. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11534.176s">The</a>  mayor's charge was fairly specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11537.338s">So</a>  we also have a number of previous parking studies that have been done, as you said, 10 years ago and more recent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11547.505s">So</a>  ideally, we would like to get to a place where we have public input as a large meeting, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11553.711s">It</a>  will not probably be in the next month.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11556.353s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11557.094s">And</a>  just if I can give a word of caution, I think that's one thing that could get in the way of this whole process, is that if the public input is held, and I'm not saying this is the case, but if it's held to the end, you may get a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11573.989s">animosity</a>  and people thinking they've been left out of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11578.41s">And</a>  so somehow, and it's a difficult, I agree with you, there's a lot going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11583.911s">Somehow</a>  I think it's important that public hearings be set up along this whole process and not just wait till the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11593.052s">And</a>  I'll leave that up to the committee, but I would highly recommend that in the interest of transparency and so forth.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11603.692s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11605.413s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11606.714s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11608.775s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and thanks, Chairman Low. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11612.096s">You</a>  guys always step up to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11614.405s">do</a>  these big tasks that no one else wants to volunteer for. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11616.927s">All</a>  right, thank you for your help. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11620.591s">Is</a>  there any discussion amongst your group with life after Republic Parking? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11626.396s">I</a>  know their contract is coming to the end very soon, and is there any discussions on that?</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11638.903s">At</a>  this point, we have not had those kind of discussions at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11642.907s">Basically,</a>  we've interviewed to go over procedure process and actually the tools needed and specifically what could be identified as enhancements. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11654.92s">We're</a>  here to make recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11656.781s">So</a>  enforcement is one of these recommendations we'll be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11660.622s">So</a>  we need to know what products are available to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11665.164s">And</a>  so most of this has been like a data gathering situation where we're trying to define specifics of process.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11674.027s">As</a>  Republic Parking been receptive to suggestions,</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11680.234s">They</a>  have been very receptive, they've been open. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11684.135s">We</a>  have a person who's administering all of these interviews, Pam Cerullo, who has done a fantastic job. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11692.198s">And</a>  they are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11693.599s">We</a>  have a meeting with them, and then they're available for any questions, any updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11699.321s">So</a>  they've been very forthcoming with information. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11701.982s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11702.742s">So</a>  are you tackling, I would think, probably the two problem areas would be South Medford and the Hillside area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11710.109s">Are</a>  those your two biggest areas you're working on at the moment?</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11714.431s">They</a>  are the GLX areas, quite honestly, so yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11717.732s">And</a>  they're some of the most densely populated areas, so parking is, resident parking and business parking, are on people's minds, so yes.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11728.376s">Is</a>  there any talk of bringing that parking back on Boston Avenue where they, along that GLX line, where they took them all those spots away, from like College Ave down to, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11741.243s">The</a>  Dunkin' Donuts?</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11743.987s">We</a>  recently had a conversation with Rocco DiRico, who is also the Hillside representative for the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11753.158s">We're,</a>  again, asking the businesses what works, what doesn't work, et cetera, what their needs are, what their employee parking needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11762.064s">All</a>  of that data information are gathering. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11765.426s">I</a>  think that's sort of a secondary aspect, looking at parking, seeing what's available, what the needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11771.651s">So</a>  ultimately, I'm certain that we will come to some sort of realization of our needs.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11777.555s">Thanks,</a>  Jim.</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11779.678s">To</a>  address that specific concern, obviously there's still a lot of construction happening between Tufts and the GLX, so it's on a larger roadmap to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11792.768s">We're</a>  not necessarily looking at every street.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11797.732s">My</a>  question was, you know, on Boston Avenue, where College is down, they used to be all parking along this strip that's now gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11808.216s">probably</a>  a public representative duty for these spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11811.657s">Are</a>  those spots going to be brought back after the train station comes in?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11817.961s">There's</a>  discussion about what will happen to those spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11820.642s">I</a>  can't say for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11823.504s">It's</a>  in flux.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11825.665s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11828.616s">Thank</a>  you vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11833.32s">We</a>  have a council of bears has a question and then we'll go on to Mari. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11839.485s">Council</a>  of bears.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11988.124s">There</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11989.045s">It's</a>  commissionpe at gmail.com.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=11998.006s">We</a>  also have a phone number, area code 339-221-7027.</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12003.988s">And</a>  again, all this contact information is also on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12011.391s">Our</a>  meetings other than this week, because it is the start of Hanukkah, this week's meeting is Thursday at 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12019.274s">The</a>  Zoom information link is on the city's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12022.575s">Other</a>  than that, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12024.824s">The</a>  public meetings are held Wednesday at 7 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12028.547s">We</a>  welcome the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12030.649s">And</a>  then one other piece of business is that everyone should know that the Green Line meeting is happening, and the public meeting is happening tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12038.296s">You</a>  can sign up to the MBTA's website to attend the meeting, but it'll be an update meeting of what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12042.839s">And</a>  Jim and I would be happy to come back before the Council and give you an update on the Green Line as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12048.473s">Great,</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12050.755s">And</a>  John, everyone knows how to get a hold of me.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12053.497s">Yes,</a>  we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12055.799s">Thank</a>  you, Marty. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12060.003s">If</a>  I may, Jim and Laurel, I believe a while back, there was a parking study that was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12067.189s">I</a>  think it was when Chief Sacco was leaving and Chief Buckley was coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12073.674s">Is</a>  that something that you're looking at?</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12075.676s">Actually,</a>  we're using that as a baseline, one of our baselines. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12079.439s">It</a>  has specific numbers, it has specific focus, so yes, we're using that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12083.722s">And</a>  it is available for anyone to view. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12086.264s">Any</a>  information that people want to review, just contact through the email and we'll send you a link.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12092.829s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12093.69s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12094.17s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12094.93s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12096.011s">Thank</a>  you for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12097.773s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12098.373s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12099.354s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12100.433s">Mr.</a>  President, just one question regarding the scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12105.716s">Does</a>  it include recommendations regarding taking the parking service in-house as well as removal of the kiosk? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12114.802s">Will</a>  that be things that the commission works on?</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12120.152s">What</a>  we're doing is we're getting recommendations from the public through the public response. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12126.074s">What</a>  we're gathering also is cost involved in other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12129.775s">We're</a>  asking specific questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12132.396s">So</a>  we're hopeful when we submit our recommendations, we'll also have an opportunity to have some sort of implementation process with a rough estimate of cost, et cetera, if you're to change things out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12146.181s">And</a>  very basic, very, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12148.448s">very</a>  minimal, but at the same time, it will give the implementation folks an opportunity to focus. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12154.611s">So</a>  the answer to your question is we're looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12157.232s">We're</a>  getting the results of public input in regards to that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12162.735s">So</a>  your ultimate recommendations will include looking at whether or not to take in-house or to look at an alternative from the kiosk.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12175.012s">I</a>  think it will be easier for folks to make that decision based on the information we're able to compile and sort of the direction of the report will sort of be telling on the decisions that need to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12186.941s">So,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12188.162s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12188.362s">It's</a>  a shame that everything's on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12193.526s">It's</a>  a complicated, as you know, topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12196.508s">The</a>  current parking in Medford is street by street for parking for residents and then <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12203.572s">enforcement.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12207.996s">And</a>  so, you know, the issue is, is if we want more enforcement, then we'd have to look at the entire program anyway, because we have X amount of enforcement officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12215.721s">So</a>  one decision then triggers many others. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12220.024s">So,</a>  yes, we are looking at what it looks like to have the current parking program, what it looks like to have the existing parking program, what it looks like to have the existing parking <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12225.738s">parking</a>  across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12226.979s">It</a>  looks like to have zone parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12228.3s">I</a>  would say probably the one option that's not on the table right now is no parking enforcement whatsoever.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12236.766s">If</a>  I could just jump in one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12239.048s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12241.03s">Michael,</a>  I am looking for the City Council to give us a huge bond to support this whole program.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12253.935s">How's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12255.136s">That</a>  sounds like a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12257.738s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12260.628s">So</a>  I just want to understand, so this commission will be making recommendations from what I'm hearing sometime in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12267.53s">That's</a>  when the mayor asked for recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12270.671s">And</a>  then the actual implementation, has there been any discussion about once recommendations are with the mayor, has there been any discussion about implementation, which is I would assume the next phase of this?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12286.476s">Correct,</a>  there is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12287.996s">We</a>  are charged just to make recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12291.895s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12295.818s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12297.419s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks brought up something about the kiosks, whether they stay, whether they go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12302.622s">If</a>  I recall, I think during the discussions, I think we owned them at the end of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12308.746s">So</a>  the question is, do we keep them? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12313.369s">I</a>  think President Falco and I have gone to a couple of shows there, and we asked about the lifespan of <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12320.91s">Those</a>  kiosks, and they're saying they're seven to ten years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12324.872s">And</a>  those are going to be ten years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12326.072s">I</a>  mean, is the decision made, do we take them and throw them out, or do we spend the money to upgrade them and bring them up to speed? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12334.776s">Because</a>  those are upgradable, and let's see, we are going to own them at the end of our contract here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12342.379s">So</a>  either we make use of them, or we figure we throw them out.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12447.467s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12448.848s">I</a>  don't know if it's the result of flushing or whatnot, maybe some underground utility work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12454.553s">But</a>  for about nine to 11 days over the past two weeks or so, there's been a tremendous amount of brown water in South Medford neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12465.262s">Sometimes</a>  actually stretching all the way up to the back end of High Street, over by the river, near Mari's restaurant actually, up the street more or less though towards the barbershop and <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12476.811s">the</a>  jewelry store, Rollins and VIP. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12479.417s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I've gotten a number of complaints stretching from Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12487.088s">all</a>  the way back to the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12488.97s">So</a>  I'm asking the DPW Water Department to provide us with an update as to what's going on, why there was so much brown water in the area for such an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12496.957s">You</a>  know, a lot of people were a little upset when they were trying to make the mashed potatoes and they ran the water and it was brown on Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12503.483s">So</a>  I'm just hoping we can get some clarification and address some concerns, Mr. President, as to what's going on.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12508.748s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12509.749s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by- Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12751.946s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12753.307s">I</a>  was heartened today that there has now been action from Governor Baker on, he's rolled us back to phase three, step one, given the concerning statistics, concerning is an under, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12766.406s">underwhelming</a>  word to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12768.148s">COVID</a>  cases across the state are double what they were during the spring lockdown, both in terms of daily cases and the seven day average. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12775.938s">It's</a>  rising exponentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12777.7s">Two</a>  thirds, 67% of Massachusetts ICU beds are already occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12782.946s">That's</a>  closer to 90 to 95% in Rhode Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12787.357s">Tens</a>  of thousands of cases and hundreds more, if not thousands more deaths are expected. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12791.979s">And</a>  we've had some major clusters here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12795.001s">So</a>  yes, Governor Baker reverted to phase three, step one today. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12799.443s">But</a>  we weren't even at phase one when we had half as many cases in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12803.905s">So,</a>  you know, it really does present some serious health dangers to <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12809.856s">thousands</a>  of residents and I would say thousands of residents here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12815.06s">I</a>  would just like an update by next week at our December 15th meeting on any actions the city is able to take on mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12824.347s">I</a>  understand that it's essential that we follow the state guidelines in terms of phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12828.75s">We're</a>  not going to be able to address the spread of this disease alone if other communities are not doing it with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12835.535s">But</a>  I think there are a lot of steps that could be taken <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12838.498s">like</a>  a robocall before the holidays to remind people to stay safe, to meet gathering limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12843.36s">You</a>  know, we've, we're basically just now starting to see the Thanksgiving spike in COVID cases across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12850.123s">And</a>  we don't want to double down over the December holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12856.025s">And,</a>  you know, we have months ahead and we have the winter months ahead before a vaccine gets distributed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12862.168s">And</a>  I think the last thing we want to see is Massachusetts and quite frankly, the entire country, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12867.795s">you</a>  know, coming into the train station, having just lost more people and had more cases in the past few months than we did in our first spike and second spike earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12879.785s">So</a>  that's really the intent, is for both written and verbal update from the administration on anything that they are doing and that, you know, any actions that they are taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12890.133s">And</a>  I think, to me, a big piece of that should be what guidelines and suggestions are we making to people <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12896.816s">for</a>  how they should, you know, gather or not gather during the holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12904.178s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12904.918s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Peers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12908.36s">Any</a>  other comments?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12909.4s">Mr.</a>  President, didn't we vote on a paper that was very similar to this, asking the mayor to appear before us and she agreed to appear before us periodically to give updates?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12918.763s">You</a>  are correct because I remember, I think it was Councilor Morell's paper.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12924.769s">I</a>  think she said Perry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12926.272s">I</a>  think the mayor's response is out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12928.135s">It</a>  was periodically. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12929.597s">I</a>  don't think it came out monthly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12931.08s">It</a>  came out periodically. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12933.063s">But</a>  it's my understanding that the statistics data and the like are all compiled on <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12938.913s">Wednesdays,</a>  and they have their powwows on Wednesdays relative to this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12942.476s">So</a>  we'd be getting the week before's information if we did that on a Tuesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12948.842s">But</a>  whatever direction we go when we go, and Mr. President, I just again request that we get this in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12954.206s">I</a>  feel like our meetings are turning into more like television shows and less like meetings.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12958.19s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12958.89s">I</a>  understand and I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12959.871s">I</a>  mean, we should have something in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12962.373s">We</a>  definitely do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12965.87s">you</a>  know, some sort of an update from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12967.81s">We</a>  haven't received one. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12968.811s">What</a>  was it, Councilor Morell, if you don't mind, do you know the last time we actually received?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12973.372s">I</a>  think we got it in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12974.692s">We</a>  didn't get it in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12976.152s">And</a>  then we're in December now, I believe, because I believe that the second month was missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12981.913s">I</a>  think also it was, you know, cases were still at least on the lower end. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12987.254s">So</a>  I think needing the update now is more dire.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12993.056s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12993.616s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12993.916s">And</a>  I, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=12995.738s">I</a>  miss, I did not include it in here, but a written and verbal update is the language I used in my next resolution, but I would like that for this resolution as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13004.842s">And</a>  I agree with councilor Knight for any update that this council receives.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13009.624s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13010.104s">And</a>  if actually, you know, if I could actually vice president, if you wouldn't mind coming up, I just have a couple, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have met here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13031.702s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward, because I think it is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13034.264s">And</a>  I think Councilor Morell, thank you for bringing our resolution forward a few months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13039.788s">And</a>  I think it's important that we receive periodic updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13044.911s">Actually,</a>  they should be monthly updates, but we should be notified on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13049.094s">Because</a>  I know I'm getting all kinds of questions with regard to, I think some of the data, general questions as to, and I think a lot of it is education with regard to, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13062.043s">You</a>  know, I got a lot of questions about, you know, what is the threshold for notifying the community about potential exposure? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13069.925s">So</a>  if there are, you know, how is a cluster determined? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13073.466s">You</a>  know, if a cluster is determined, you know, is there ability to contact trace or whatnot? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13080.228s">So</a>  if we could, if you wouldn't mind, if we, if Councilor Bears, if we could, if I could amend that to, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13086.49s">for</a>  the administration of the Board of Health to respond as to what is the threshold for notifying the community about potential exposure? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13094.794s">And</a>  how is a cluster determined? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13099.516s">And</a>  if there is a cluster in the community, especially in the business community, what types of organizations are subject to public notification? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13108.213s">Is</a>  it restaurants? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13109.313s">Is</a>  it retail? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13110.634s">Is</a>  it healthcare providers? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13112.815s">How</a>  do they define that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13113.935s">I've</a>  been getting a lot of questions about that type of thing, questions like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13126.06s">How</a>  does a communication work between the Board of Health and businesses? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13131.992s">Are</a>  the businesses given information from the Board of Health as to what is expected? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13137.596s">How</a>  is this communicated? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13138.797s">Are</a>  businesses getting information via email? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13143.881s">Is</a>  it a periodic email from the Board of Health? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13148.084s">We</a>  need to know how that's being communicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13149.986s">I'm</a>  sure it's being communicated, or I hope it's being communicated, but we need a clear indication of exactly how it's being communicated to the business community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13162.688s">And</a>  last but not least, I know there was an event this weekend at the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13168.597s">And</a>  I think they had about 250 people at the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13173.304s">And</a>  my question I guess is, did the Board of Health approve that event? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13179.257s">I'm</a>  not sure how that works, but I think that we need to get answers on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13183.962s">Did</a>  they approve the event? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13185.804s">And</a>  it sounds like towards the end of the event, it was modified. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13189.749s">So</a>  it became, I think the person that was performing was supposed to be singing in public, on the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13197.497s">And</a>  Councilor, Vice President Caraviello, you might be able to explain this further, but I think that last minute- They had them perform in the green room.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13205.723s">They</a>  were operating about at 10% capacity, and they had all the safety protocols in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13213.929s">And</a>  I think at the last minute, either the Board of Health or the Department of Health stepped in and made them change to <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13223.253s">I</a>  think the band was on stage, but the actual performer performed in another room. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13227.935s">So</a>  he was on like a screen in front of the 250 people that were in the auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13235.399s">So</a>  I don't know if that was either through our Board of Health or the Department of Health made that recommendation, I can't-.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13240.782s">And</a>  that's a clarification I'd like to receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13243.223s">I</a>  think if I could amend the paper further to find out who approved the event originally and <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13250.706s">Who</a>  requested the modifications to the event? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13254.548s">I</a>  mean, from what I could tell from the research I did, I think the tickets went on sale in October, and the event was, I believe it was December 4th, I think this past Saturday.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13265.834s">And</a>  it sounded like- I think it was three or four shows.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13268.436s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13269.376s">And</a>  the event changed, I think, right beforehand. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13271.358s">So</a>  if we could get some clarification on that, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13275.48s">I</a>  thank Councilor Bearst for bringing this forward and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13280.028s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may, and I support all of those amendments, and that was actually kind of more my intent with this next resolution, but I'm happy to have an amendment on this resolution wherever it needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13293.32s">What</a>  does enforcement mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13295.723s">That's</a>  really the question I have here, you know, and it's, I'm going to talk more about it on the next item, but there's just rumors and <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13303.857s">and</a>  I think we've all seen some of the less factual ones that seem to have been out there recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13311.682s">We</a>  need clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13313.643s">What</a>  does enforcement mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13314.724s">How</a>  is that being communicated? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13316.445s">And</a>  is it being administered equitably across everyone in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13321.628s">So</a>  I support Councilor Falco's amendments, and that's my intent with both this resolution and the next resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13329.253s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13822.704s">I'd</a>  like to offer a B paper, Mr. President, on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13825.987s">I</a>  mean, it builds right upon what Councilor Bears is talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13829.772s">It's</a>  the narrative and the spin that's put on certain issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13833.896s">I'm</a>  offering a B paper asking what the criteria is for a robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13842.082s">Over</a>  this past week, we all got robocalls concerning certain business establishments in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13848.345s">That</a>  was the only robocall I ever got about a business establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13851.427s">I've</a>  never heard about any other establishments ever in this community that have ever had any type of outbreak or any type of contract tracing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13858.97s">So</a>  it's very concerning to me, Mr. President, especially based upon the current circumstances in the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13865.993s">where</a>  one out of five is unemployed, where we're seeing a lot of small businesses closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13870.277s">I</a>  think sometimes taking a deep breath and thinking a little bit before speaking makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13876.181s">I</a>  know I'm certainly guilty of not doing that a lot of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13879.964s">But</a>  ultimately, I'd like to know what the criteria that's being used is for a robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13885.114s">notification</a>  to the community relative to COVID clusters. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13887.915s">Is</a>  there a policy or a protocol? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13890.156s">Is</a>  it just, you know, when I feel like doing it, I'm going to do it or what? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=13894.138s">I</a>  mean, because I think that, you know, every action has a reaction and the reaction that the community has can be very damaging to small businesses if our ducks aren't in a row and our facts are not accurate.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14027.733s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14029.354s">I</a>  think one of the greatest tragedies of this pandemic is that we haven't been able to mourn people that we've lost either to COVID-19 or to other, you know, causes of death during this pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14041.342s">And</a>  from what we know from past incidents like this, and there's actually been very little that's happened as quickly as this has, the COVID-19 death rate is faster on a daily basis than any war in the history of the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14057.652s">The</a>  Civil War is an example of a very similar lack of being able to mourn, and it impacted people's lives for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14066.257s">So</a>  the intent here is that we would have a memorial of some kind to the pandemic, to the people who we've lost, and also to people, I think, who may suffer the rest of their lives due to the disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14080.986s">But</a>  I don't want to, say, put any timelines on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14083.848s">I</a>  was hoping <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14085.307s">that</a>  we would be discussing this, you know, maybe closer to being on a path to vaccination and on the other side of this pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14095.554s">But</a>  I, you know, I put it forward as the idea has been discussed and come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14099.957s">And</a>  I think it's just important that we acknowledge that it's something that we want to do as a community to acknowledge and give ourselves some space to mourn this collective tragedy once the pandemic restrictions are lifted. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14114.627s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14284.177s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14286.119s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14286.799s">I</a>  think during these trying times, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14290.253s">placing</a>  more restrictions and more burdens on businesses and eating establishments is the last thing we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14295.356s">If</a>  I go to Carol's restaurant and I sit down and I want to have something to eat and I say, no, Mari, keep the silverware. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14300.759s">I</a>  don't want the silverware, I want the plastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14302.46s">Or</a>  I can, plastic by request, I just don't understand it, Mr. President, if they send out a delivery to a house or a work establishment, then they get a phone call, there are no forks and knives, can you bring them back? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14313.586s">I</a>  mean, it puts an impact on the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14316.247s">When</a>  it comes to cost-saving measures and cost-cutting measures, businesses do a pretty good job policing themselves and regulating themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14322.09s">And</a>  if this is something that they want to implement, they should. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14325.031s">But</a>  I just don't think at this point in time, further regulating and further burdening businesses, especially, mostly these are small businesses that do take up business, is the right thing to do at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14336.396s">So</a>  for that reason, I'll be voting no.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14338.677s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14339.617s">Any</a>  other questions or comments from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14342.198s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14342.939s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14344.402s">Is</a>  this for take-out only or is it for dine-in take-out? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14350.043s">Good</a>  question. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14350.604s">I'm</a>  not quite sure what this applies to.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14352.344s">Could</a>  the Council please clarify?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14354.384s">The</a>  intent was for take-out and delivery.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14358.485s">Take-out</a>  and delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14359.506s">Oh,</a>  so OK, it's just take-out and delivery only?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14362.366s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14365.867s">Yes,</a>  it was just the idea that sometimes you get 10 forks and knives stuck in a bag, and you don't need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14372.469s">And</a>  if you need them, you could <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14374.145s">just</a>  say, can you add forks and knives to the delivery order is essentially the intent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14379.47s">I</a>  mean, given the conditions and also the staff enforcement levels that we are able to operate in the city, I think this would largely be more of a guidance and a suggestion or, you know, I do not think that we will have someone in every restaurant enforcing the, you know, utensil policy with the severe, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14399.155s">I</a>  think it's more to say, you know, this is something that's easy to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14403.098s">You</a>  may not be doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14403.919s">It</a>  helps a lot, given the fact that the rise in takeout and delivery is so much higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14410.564s">You</a>  know, there were, when we had full in-restaurant dining, indoor dining, most people were getting silverware at the restaurant, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14419.011s">Now,</a>  a lot more people are doing takeout and delivery instead of eating indoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14422.914s">So,</a>  you know, usually when you get something delivered or you take something out, it comes home, you have silverware at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14428.213s">Then</a>  you have four plastic forks and knives in your bag, too, and they end up being unused or stuffed in a drawer at best, if not just immediately thrown away. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14436.939s">So</a>  that was the intent of this resolution.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14444.944s">OK,</a>  so first of all, do you want to amend the resolution to say take out only?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14450.088s">Sure,</a>  I'd be happy to only provide plastic utensils, straws, and stirrers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14456.692s">for</a>  takeout and delivery upon the request of the customer.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14463.114s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14463.955s">Yes,</a>  let's see, Councilor Marks had the floor, and then Councilor Morell had her hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14468.456s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14469.596s">I</a>  just want to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14471.377s">I</a>  think Councilor Bears said this would be for guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14474.978s">However,</a>  it's asking the Board of Health and the Office of Energy and Environment to establish a policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14482.141s">Most</a>  policies will have some type of enforcement <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14486.682s">with</a>  the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14487.542s">So</a>  do you anticipate an enforcement onto this policy, or is it guidance? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14493.064s">Because</a>  they're two completely different things.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14496.686s">I</a>  mean, I think functionally a lot of our policies are not enforced fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14501.347s">That</a>  was just a statement that I was making in general, because we don't have the resources to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14507.069s">If</a>  changing the word policy to guidance would make Councilors more amenable to moving this forward, I personally would be happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14516.57s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14518.492s">Well,</a>  I'm not sure, Mr. President, if we currently don't have enough resources, why would we add on another administrative responsibility if we don't have enough resources right now to control what we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14531.325s">I</a>  just don't know what this is getting at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14535.912s">If</a>  I'm at work and I order a cup of soup and it arrives and there's no spoon, that's a concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14542.974s">And</a>  I guess we take for granted that a restaurant, if I'm doing takeout, is going to put the necessary things in the bag so I can consume my food. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14555.098s">And</a>  part of that may be a straw, a napkin, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14560.719s">And</a>  so I'm not quite sure what this is getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14563.161s">Is</a>  this COVID related or is this outside of COVID? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14567.625s">I</a>  don't know what this is getting at.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14574.631s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14576.272s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14577.989s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14578.789s">I</a>  mean, this is in direct response to just the increase of single-use plastics that's come as a result of COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14584.393s">There's</a>  a lot of, you know, unfortunately the meals that are not being had inside of restaurants are being replaced, thankfully, by takeout. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14591.757s">And</a>  there's just, it's so much more plastic that does come with a cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14595.599s">It</a>  comes with a cost to all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14597.14s">It</a>  comes with a cost to future Councilors introducing resolutions when these forks and spoons are on the felsway dumped in someone's yard and we want to have them cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14605.984s">I</a>  mean, I think it's, this is actually a fairly, some ordering services, this is a common selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14612.627s">You</a>  can select whether or not to have utensils. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14615.788s">I</a>  know a few establishments I frequent in Medford actually do have this option, and it would be something that, again, just guidance, I imagine this is guidance as well, but something that when you're placing an order, someone on the phone says, okay, do you need utensils with that, as opposed to just, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14632.135s">Throwing</a>  a fistful in but again, this is not something that we have the ability to really <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14639.62s">It's</a>  not something we really have the ability to enforce, of course, but I think having guidance that people can look to and say, okay, this is probably just a way to minimize waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14647.924s">I</a>  think it's, is there a direct response to the way the pandemic has reshaped the, and really to push back a lot of advances we have made in reusables and now has really increased the amount of plastic trash we're seeing, you know, as a community globally, everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14665.672s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14667.407s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14668.127s">Just</a>  if I could, I'm a little confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14673.648s">If</a>  it's something we can't enforce, then why are we asking to a border health and the energy environment office to establish a policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14685.57s">If</a>  it's something we can't enforce and then only to only provide plastic utensils upon request. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14692.592s">So</a>  you're asking businesses, <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14694.988s">not</a>  to provide this unless someone asks you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14697.909s">So</a>  I don't understand how they're saying in one point it's, you know, it's only, you know, it's, it's, it's just guidance, but they want a policy that surrounds it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14710.187s">and</a>  I assume a policy, you know, to me, the better approach would be if this is a cause and something you're interested in, why not approach the Chamber of Commerce and ask the Chamber of Commerce, hey, you know what, we're concerned about the plastic utensils and the number of utensils that are given out and I share a lot of those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14729.691s">But</a>  I'm not sure a legislative enactment or a policy has to be the way to go about getting the word out in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14738.364s">You</a>  may have businesses owners that would love to save money, because they're very expensive, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14745.153s">And</a>  they may love to save money on that, but I'm not sure this is the appropriate way of doing this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14751.638s">And</a>  we heard for a long period of time about doing away with straws. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14758.363s">Now</a>  it's stirrers, plastic utensils. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14764.508s">I</a>  just think there's a better way of doing this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14767.91s">Therefore,</a>  I cannot support this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14769.511s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14770.692s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14771.733s">We</a>  have Councilor Knight and Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14773.634s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14775.697s">I</a>  was just going to ask if Mr. Costas was still on the call from the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. President, but I think he goes to bed at 930.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14788.742s">I'd</a>  be happy to propose that I amend the words a policy to guidance.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14795.424s">Guidance?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14799.646s">So</a>  you have guidance and takeout only. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14801.647s">Takeout</a>  and delivery only. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14803.167s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14804.268s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14805.515s">have</a>  a motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14807.436s">I</a>  have the floor, Sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14808.197s">So</a>  there was there was a couple of a couple of amendments that were put forth.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14836.708s">Let</a>  me check with the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14843.11s">It's</a>  buffered by both, right?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14844.25s">Yeah,</a>  because I moved approval because I moved approval and then Councilor Bears wanted to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14849.712s">So</a>  I kind of jumped the gun on moving approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14852.053s">So</a>  I very rudely moved approval before he could speak.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14855.735s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14857.088s">Okay,</a>  so technically under Robert's rules, once discussion has occurred, there is a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14861.229s">I'm</a>  just saying that technically under Robert's rules, once discussion has occurred, it functions as a second.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14868.59s">So</a>  I have a, the consular morale did move approval, but I don't have, I don't have a second in my notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14878.212s">So,</a>  and the clerk doesn't have a second either. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14882.033s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14886.148s">We</a>  can put it on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14886.989s">You</a>  just take a vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14887.95s">Either</a>  way.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14938.87s">Mr.</a>  President, motion to waive the reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14944.988s">I</a>  would be happy to provide a brief summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14947.929s">Prior,</a>  I was also going to make a motion to send it to the solicitor for review before holding a committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14953.251s">But</a>  I would be happy to provide a brief summary if.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14955.711s">Please</a>  do so.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14957.212s">Essentially,</a>  back in January, I filed a paper requesting that the city solicitor develop a framework for an ordinance around regulations for short-term rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14969.856s">The</a>  Acts of 2018 by the Massachusetts General <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14974.139s">Court,</a>  the Mass General Laws, allow the city to implement regulations around short-term rentals, including a registry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14983.206s">This</a>  would complement the vote we took earlier this year to charge an excise tax to short-term rental properties in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=14992.333s">I</a>  based this ordinance, which is pretty lengthy, as you can see, both on the solicitor's framework as well as ordinances in Boston and Salem <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15004.038s">But</a>  I did, I think, strike a balance different from both of those ordinances in this proposed ordinance for sake of time and the fact that this is one of the last things on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15017.607s">I</a>  would make a motion to send this draft to the solicitor for review and then hold a committee of the whole with the building commissioner, finance director, community development director, and city solicitor after it has been reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15031.761s">Mr.</a>  President, similar papers are already in the ordinance committee.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15040.166s">Why</a>  would we send a draft ordinance to the city solicitor for review?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15050.631s">I</a>  haven't seen it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15052.612s">Why</a>  would we have a city solicitor look at a seven page draft ordinance <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15058.058s">that</a>  hasn't been looked at by this council, no recommendations by this council, no public meeting by this council, other than the fact that it paid off this agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15067.842s">Why</a>  would we send this paper to the city solicitor for review? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15072.304s">Review</a>  of what? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15073.884s">Review</a>  of this language? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15076.258s">Is</a>  the city solicitor now part of this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15080.62s">I</a>  mean, I don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15082.061s">I</a>  don't understand putting the seven-page ordinance on, Mr. President, because we have ways of initiating subjects, Mr. President, for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15092.826s">But,</a>  hey, that could be, you know, I'm not going to criticize that, but why would we send a paper to the city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15100.029s">It</a>  makes zero sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15102.99s">I</a>  would like to provide some answers.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15104.472s">Councilor</a>  Marks, I'll answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15105.472s">The</a>  reason I offered the motion was because in 2017, in 2019, in 2020, we've tasked the city solicitor with drafting an ordinance relative to short-term rentals in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15117.381s">Between</a>  2017 and 2019, there was a series of litigation events and other regulatory parameters that were established that created a criteria that would now allow a community to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15130.031s">So</a>  I know I've sent <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15132.96s">the</a>  solicitor's office at least 50 pages worth of documentation, a white page report on best practices on how to regulate short-term rentals and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15145.183s">And</a>  in the last discussion that we had with the city solicitor, it was that she was working on a draft, still to date, I do believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15152.385s">And</a>  the reason to send this to her would be to have her review it and contrast it with what she has already worked on to see if there's any items in here that might be <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15160.707s">left</a>  out and then present it back to the council for us to review.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15164.369s">That</a>  seems like a convoluted way of going about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15167.291s">It</a>  really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15168.952s">I</a>  know I appreciate your response, but that seems like we're the legislative body. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15173.595s">So</a>  if this is language that we want to attain, we should send it to committee, the whole subcommittee, take a look at it, review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15181.759s">It</a>  just doesn't make sense, especially now knowing that the city solicitor may be working on an ordinance at this council's request and then giving her another seven pages, saying take a look at this, unless we think she's doing nothing all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15194.444s">It</a>  just makes no sense to me.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15196.465s">It</a>  just makes no sense.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15197.706s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15198.286s">I</a>  know that, if I may really quickly, I know that the city solicitor is quite busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15203.408s">Is</a>  that Jonathan? <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15206.169s">And</a>  I know that, I believe Councilor Knight, you were saying you had an ordinance similar to this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15212.514s">The</a>  ordinance subcommittee just met, what was it, last month and we prioritized several papers that were in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15218.138s">The</a>  first paper I believe was, we had food trucks, we had sick leave bank, we had short term rentals, we had small cell wireless towers were the four top items that we discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15230.066s">There</a>  might have been one other in there out of the five, but <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15232.621s">you</a>  know, right there at the top of the iceberg from important items that the subcommittee was going to be working on to put out as a work product to this committee of the whole as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15241.646s">So</a>  with that being said, maybe we send it to the subcommittee that's working on that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15246.749s">And</a>  we could take some of the ideas that are in this and contrast it with what the city solicitor gives us when she does.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15252.072s">That's</a>  what I was going to recommend is that when it comes back, then reconcile the two and see what's missing and see if there's something that should be put in.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15262.188s">I</a>  understand that Councilor Knight has introduced resolutions on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15265.75s">The</a>  item discussed in the ordinance subcommittee, while I'm not a member of the subcommittee, I believe was the paper we received from the city solicitor outlining a draft framework for a short-term rental ordinance, which is what this council requested in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15278.557s">As</a>  I was the filer of that request, and then we received a draft framework, which in my opinion was still very <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15286.493s">It</a>  was more a list of questions than a framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15289.235s">My</a>  assumption from that was that that was the product of the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15292.597s">And</a>  so I went ahead using that framework and other ordinances to draft a draft ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15297.339s">I'm</a>  not a member of the ordinances subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15300.401s">And</a>  my intent here, I'd be happy to strip out sending it to the solicitor review and just have a committee of the whole on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15305.344s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15307.265s">She</a>  was part of the process that I initiated with my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15311.107s">She</a>  sent a framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15312.488s">I</a>  developed a draft based on that framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15316.3s">I</a>  did not think it would be unreasonable to send that back to her, considering that she's been part of this chain of events, but I would be happy to adjust my motion just to have a committee of the whole on this matter with the people I suggested.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15328.992s">So</a>  Councilor Bears, is your motion to move this to committee of the whole for further review?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15333.976s">Sure,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15335.338s">On</a>  that motion, seconded by... Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15341.268s">Councilor</a>  Rao. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15342.608s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15343.809s">I</a>  do believe when the paper was initially introduced in January, Mr. President, and the clerk may be able to take a look in the records if he hasn't before him, the prior paper was joined to it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15356.472s">Which</a>  one?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15356.992s">The</a>  prior paper was joined.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15358.492s">Joined.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15358.812s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15360.153s">What</a>  prior paper are you referring to?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15361.953s">The</a>  paper from the previous session that we were working on.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15364.534s">That's</a>  what I'm thinking of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15365.194s">I</a>  remember there was one that dated a while back.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15366.674s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15367.335s">The</a>  paper from the previous session was joined to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15370.531s">And</a>  now the paper from the previous session still remains in the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15375.496s">And</a>  it's never been reported out of the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15377.959s">And</a>  the reason it hasn't been reported out of the subcommittee is because we're waiting for the information from the city solicitor's office.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15383.545s">So</a>  maybe that's what needs to be had rather than... You know, we can entertain new language, but this seems like it's... <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15390.35s">asking</a>  for its own separate process. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15393.493s">And</a>  I think, you know, it's, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15398.216s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15399.778s">Is</a>  the motion already on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15401.819s">I</a>  just, if I may, I do not care what process we go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15406.703s">I</a>  want to achieve this goal, which we've been trying to achieve for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15410.266s">I'm</a>  happy to do that in any way that my fellow Councilors want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15413.362s">I</a>  think that this language reflects good research, and it could be a good baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15417.144s">I</a>  have not seen a proposed ordinance based on the Medford Code of Ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15421.706s">That's</a>  why I took the liberty of drafting this as a councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15424.728s">And</a>  I did not mean any ill intent by proposing it on this agenda, or to subvert any existing processes, or erase any existing motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15433.852s">So</a>  if the council thinks that the Subcommittee on Ordinances is the place to discuss this, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15440.53s">I</a>  don't know how I will be able to have input on that discussion, but that's fine with me, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15443.833s">I</a>  just want to get something done. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15445.675s">So</a>  I will withdraw my motion in favor of the motion on the subcommittee on ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15451.32s">But</a>  there's no subterfuge here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15453.161s">This</a>  is just language and research that I did and wrote out to put before the council to try to advance this issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15459.847s">I</a>  think it's reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15461.095s">I</a>  think it's balanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15461.996s">I</a>  think upon further review, people will find that this is a good approach for the city and reflects the prior motions that have been made around the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15469.322s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15469.703s">So,</a>  Councilor Bears, are you okay with withdrawing that motion and sending it to the subcommittee on ordinances?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15475.608s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L-hLu0ibDYc&t=15476.749s">I</a>  truly did not think these would be the three controversial issues of the night.</p>
