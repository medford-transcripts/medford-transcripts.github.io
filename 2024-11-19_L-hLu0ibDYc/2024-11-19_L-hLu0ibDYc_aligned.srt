Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

11
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:27,915
The rules are suspended.

12
00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:29,236
Councilor Morrell.

13
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:32,919
Motion to take paper 20-672 out of order.

14
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,844
I know Anne-Marie with the Medford Streets program is only able to be on for the earlier part of the meeting.

15
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:40,405
I'm sorry, 20-672?

16
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:40,585
Yes.

17
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,071
This is communications from the mayor.

18
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:08,135
December 1st, 2020, to President John Falco and honorable members of the Memphis City Council, from Rianna Longo, current mayor, regarding licensing of food trucks.

19
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:16,319
Dear President Falco and members of the Memphis City Council, I respectfully request that the City Council approve the following list of food trucks for events.

20
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:20,358
that are scheduled for the coming months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

21
00:02:20,498 --> 00:02:32,642
In the city's temporary policies, limiting events and gatherings, the attached application includes some unique considerations, which have been reviewed and approved by my office, as well as the Board of Health.

22
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,602
Method streets updated request.

23
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:43,785
Location dates to be determined by resident request, seeking up to five locations between November and March, requesting one lunch,

24
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:49,661
and or dinner in one dessert truck per location and or date.

25
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:51,443
Thank you for your consideration.

26
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:53,584
Respectfully submitted, Mayor Brianna Longo-Kern.

27
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:56,766
Councilor Morrell.

28
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:57,967
Thank you, Mr. President.

29
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:01,410
It's my understanding that Annemarie Aigner is on the call.

30
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,731
She's behind this program.

31
00:03:02,751 --> 00:03:06,053
I think she can speak more specifically into what they're seeking.

32
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:08,915
Mr. President.

33
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,739
Councilor, Councilor Knight.

34
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:21,207
Yeah, I do believe this paper was before the council previously and the council said we have no problem with entertaining the idea provided that they provide us with the dates and locations as to when these food trucks are going to be operating in our community.

35
00:03:21,227 --> 00:03:24,489
Okay.

36
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,790
Thank you.

37
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,372
Council Knight, I believe you are correct in that.

38
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:28,713
Um,

39
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:33,625
did you say, I'm sorry, Councilor Morrell, did you say someone was on the call that?

40
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:37,707
Yeah, it's Anne-Marie Aigner, A-I-G-N-E-R.

41
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:42,070
And I think it's just that their request has been updated.

42
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,210
And the mayor has her hand up.

43
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,971
So let's see.

44
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,472
Mayor, you want to go first?

45
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,513
Thank you.

46
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:53,896
I don't know if Anne-Marie is on the call, but I know Jackie Peeks, our communications director is on the call as well as myself.

47
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:57,238
And this is something that I believe was approved by the city council.

48
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,221
Months ago, thank you very much.

49
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:05,968
It wasn't taken advantage of, so we're asking for the extension of the up to five dates per resident requests.

50
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,271
And we ask for your approval of that tonight.

51
00:04:08,931 --> 00:04:09,952
OK, thank you.

52
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:11,754
I don't recall voting in favor of this.

53
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:13,556
I don't recall voting in favor of this.

54
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:15,298
Counselor Knight.

55
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:18,081
I don't recall voting in favor of this paper, Mr. President, previously.

56
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:20,920
I don't know.

57
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,801
It was contingent upon them submitting the dates to us for further review to dates and locations for further review.

58
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:27,642
But it wasn't something that we said, yeah, okay, do it.

59
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:30,222
Just go five locations anytime you want.

60
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:32,603
We still wanted to know the dates and times and locations.

61
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:33,263
Okay.

62
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,524
And this paper tonight doesn't provide that either.

63
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:38,845
Um, and I should have a Jackie peaks.

64
00:04:39,105 --> 00:04:40,585
Do you want, would you like to speak on this issue?

65
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:49,047
Jackie.

66
00:04:54,422 --> 00:04:58,787
Jackie looks like she might be having some technical issues.

67
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:03,752
Vice President Carvello.

68
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:04,593
Thank you, Mr. President.

69
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:13,482
I remember this coming up before and I thought we voted in favor, but I wasn't sure, but I don't have any problem voting for this.

70
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:14,644
I'm a little confused.

71
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:19,013
Who comes out to food trucks between November and March?

72
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:27,895
I mean, I want it to be successful, but who's gonna be standing out in January outside freezing with a food truck?

73
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:34,037
That's my only question.

74
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:39,058
I wanna see the thing be successful, but how successful are you gonna be between the coldest months of the year?

75
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,800
Standing in someone's driveway, parking, standing in the snow with a food truck.

76
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:48,772
That's really my only question.

77
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:49,212
I mean, you know.

78
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:51,953
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

79
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:52,694
Councilor Morrell.

80
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:54,435
Thank you, Mr. President.

81
00:05:54,475 --> 00:06:00,097
I did speak with Anne Marie and I know a few just food trucks are operating this way and that they're taking all orders ahead of time.

82
00:06:00,758 --> 00:06:03,099
So it's really people placing orders ahead of time online.

83
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,240
People come out to the food truck.

84
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,982
It's a, you know, a contactless handoff to get their meals, social distancing, waiting.

85
00:06:09,382 --> 00:06:11,784
I think it's really just another way to kind of get get take-out in these times.

86
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,831
We just lost the audio connection.

87
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:38,293
I'm not here for a meeting.

88
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:39,614
I'm not here for a TV show.

89
00:06:39,674 --> 00:06:39,854
I know.

90
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:42,496
So he's working on that.

91
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:43,397
Please continue.

92
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:51,983
So, Mr. President, ultimately, I believe the food truck licensing process was established as a pilot program, if I'm not mistaken, well before my time on the council.

93
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:53,885
And I guess my question is, has this

94
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:55,623
application process change now?

95
00:06:56,144 --> 00:07:00,248
I mean, are we doing things differently than we were previously based upon the nature of the applications?

96
00:07:00,308 --> 00:07:11,058
And if so, maybe that's something we need to talk about because the council has prioritized the food truck ordinance as something that we want to look at moving forward on through the ordinance subcommittee, Mr. President.

97
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:15,703
So if there's any changes to the application process that's going on, it might be nice for us to know about that as well so that as we

98
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:25,978
further discussions on the food truck ordinance, we can have some of the input that the administration's had based upon the applications and the nature of requests that they've seen over the course of the last year or so.

99
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:28,642
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

100
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:32,414
Councilman Scott Kelly.

101
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:33,034
Thank you, Mr. President.

102
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:42,558
Again, I think that I, for beginning, I think this is moving forward to initiate the involvement in food trucks in our community.

103
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:44,259
I think that it's important.

104
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,301
I think that you're seeing that as a positive trend.

105
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:52,263
And I think it's important to add this aspect to our community.

106
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:55,404
But again, my biggest concern, especially with the

107
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:06,475
with the dire issues with our brick and mortar buildings right now, approving five dates without certainty.

108
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:17,764
I think it falls into the confusion that I have is taking business away from those organizations that are drowning right now.

109
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,806
So these are the questions that we have.

110
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:26,371
That's why I believe it was in committee with the ordinance so we could talk about this and vet it out properly because I

111
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:30,073
Like I said, I'm not against the food trucks, I think it's important.

112
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:41,575
I would love to see someday an area where we line 20 food trucks down in a certain area like they do in other communities and followings come out to that area.

113
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:53,877
But when you're talking about what's happening, even right now with the governor's order of restaurants and the limitations of people at a table.

114
00:08:55,154 --> 00:09:02,062
putting a food truck on a busy weekend day next to a establishment in Medford Square.

115
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:11,912
And instead of people doing takeout out of that area to keep them going, and bringing in a food truck that might not even be part of, even registered in Medford.

116
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,655
I find that a problem right now.

117
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:17,795
So I can't, I wouldn't support this right now.

118
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:22,076
I think it's important that we establish what we wanted to do.

119
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:26,818
If there's a date, if there are events that the mayor is asking for, that's what we've done in the past.

120
00:09:27,238 --> 00:09:34,580
Until we finalize this, until we get through this pandemic, until brick and mortar establishments

121
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,721
are on solid ground again.

122
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:47,447
I apologize, but I just, as much as I like it, I just, there's too many variables right now that I get weighing against my decision to vote in favor of anything tonight.

123
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:48,267
Thank you.

124
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,688
Thank you, Councilor Scarfelli.

125
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,910
We have Jackie Peeks.

126
00:09:58,093 --> 00:09:59,254
Jackie, I'm going to try to unmute.

127
00:09:59,354 --> 00:09:59,834
Oh, there you go.

128
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,316
Hi, is that working?

129
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:02,656
Yes.

130
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:13,847
Okay, sorry, for some reason there was sound issues with Zoom initially, so I couldn't hear what you were saying at the very beginning and I apologize.

131
00:10:14,668 --> 00:10:18,794
Ann Marie is here and can provide much more detail on the application.

132
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:29,702
And I again, apologize, I don't know what the initial questions were, but just to provide some context for the initial application that came through, I believe it was in June or July.

133
00:10:29,722 --> 00:10:32,424
And this is again, just an extension of that.

134
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:41,450
What the streets program is seeking to do is by resident request, they would bring a truck to a residential area.

135
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,833
We'd worked with them on their application and sort of specified

136
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,294
working in residential neighborhoods as much as possible.

137
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:57,457
And per the council's request, initially, we had heard some questions to come back and clarify the specific dates.

138
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:04,639
And based on what the program is designed to do, it's by resident request, which they may not have at this moment in time.

139
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,742
So what we've asked Anne Marie and her team to do is if there is a resident request, they would come back to us.

140
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:14,563
We would alert the council as to the proposed date and location.

141
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:18,710
and that's how that would be if the council would agree to that.

142
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:27,157
And I think, you know, this is, again, I would defer to Ann Marie for details of the program.

143
00:11:27,197 --> 00:11:41,503
I would also just like to mention that more recently, the street team has been reaching out to schools and PTAs and sort of working with schools to provide additional support where, you know, families may need fundraising and things like that.

144
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:48,046
So they are willing to, you know, they would like to work with the community and support the community in various ways as well.

145
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:50,947
But again, I would defer to Ann Marie on details.

146
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:52,843
Point of information, Mr. President.

147
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:54,244
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

148
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:58,685
I certainly appreciate their willingness and desire to want to work with the community.

149
00:11:58,725 --> 00:12:03,466
We have a number of great establishments in Medford, like Roswell's Restaurant, for example, does great work here in the community.

150
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:08,408
This councilor just recognized Richie for the work he does in his philanthropy here in the community.

151
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,451
So, you know, we have a number of businesses that want to do good things for the people that live here that are based here in this community as well.

152
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:20,333
I did hear that the way this is is they want a blanket permit and then they want to come back to the council to tell us when they're coming.

153
00:12:20,814 --> 00:12:22,574
Well, that's pretty much the way it works right now.

154
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:27,175
If you want to come, you just tell us what the date is and the time is and you come before the council with your application and we'll hear it.

155
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:35,138
So, I'm a little confused as to why we're changing the process when the processes seem to work pretty well in the past and if, you know, it's like not like they're going to come.

156
00:12:35,878 --> 00:12:37,739
If they don't know, there are people here that are going to buy it.

157
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,681
It sounds like it's pretty much just, does your neighborhood want to do delivery from this pizza place today?

158
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:45,583
Because this pizza place will come to your neighborhood with the truck and bring you the food.

159
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:50,506
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm looking at this and I'm kind of saying, we're changing the process now.

160
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:55,489
It seems like the process that we've had in place previously is a process that would work just fine.

161
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:56,929
They have a date, a time, and a location.

162
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:00,531
If they want to go to a neighborhood, come before us, petition us, and we'll vote on it.

163
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,113
But a blanket permit and the changing of the,

164
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:14,659
material application of the food truck pilot program, which shouldn't be called the pilot program anymore because it's been in place for like nine years, you know, is ultimately problematic to me.

165
00:13:14,679 --> 00:13:19,443
And this is a paper that, you know, I don't think we need to deviate from the way we've been doing things, Mr. President.

166
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:21,586
I don't think this makes it any

167
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,169
better for the community, any more protections for our business community?

168
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,773
Just based upon what I'm hearing right now, maybe my mind can be changed and I can be swayed.

169
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:34,717
But I just kind of, I'm starting to get the feeling that it's like.

170
00:13:35,963 --> 00:13:37,064
It doesn't matter what the rules say.

171
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:39,586
We're just doing anything, however we feel like doing it right now.

172
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:42,429
And then when anybody says anything about it, it's coronavirus.

173
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,994
So I'm a little confused by the way the application process has changed and the way that the criteria has changed.

174
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:51,997
With that being said, I'm not opposed to food trucks in our community.

175
00:13:52,017 --> 00:13:54,679
I think we should have an ordinance, and I think we should allow them.

176
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,342
But I think it needs to be tightened up a little bit more than what we have here presently.

177
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:01,945
The proposed ordinance is far more restrictive than what's been outlined.

178
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:12,974
this document right here, for example, the proposed ordinance would say that if you are going to be located within 200 yards of a brick and mortar establishment, you have to get their permission to locate them.

179
00:14:13,014 --> 00:14:18,398
So there are some things I think that, you know what I mean, safeguards that we can put into the community, and that's what we've been working on through the ordinance.

180
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:24,943
So, you know, when I look at this, it's not something that I'm comfortable supporting this evening right now, I'll tell you that.

181
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:26,644
Thank you, Councilor Nights.

182
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:28,005
We have Anne Marie with us.

183
00:14:28,505 --> 00:14:30,647
Anne Marie, can we have your name and address for the record?

184
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:31,908
I'm going to unmute you right now.

185
00:14:34,358 --> 00:14:35,098
There you go.

186
00:14:35,419 --> 00:14:35,519
Yes.

187
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:35,939
Hi.

188
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:36,479
Thank you.

189
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,560
And thank you, councilor.

190
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,741
And thank you, councilors.

191
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:39,721
Thank you, Mr. President.

192
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:43,304
Thank you, Jackie, for your weighing in.

193
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:51,329
Bottom line, we're not trying to replace anybody at all.

194
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:57,573
We're trying to offer your neighbors and your residents and your much quarantined,

195
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,574
and beleaguered residents another dining opportunity.

196
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:04,195
That's all.

197
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,736
We support the restaurants.

198
00:15:07,096 --> 00:15:09,518
We don't want to be instead of the restaurants.

199
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,837
We don't, you're correct, these are small businesses.

200
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:31,425
You're right, they don't pay taxes, but their delivery is at this point, and neither does Amazon, neither does Uber Eats, neither do some of the other delivery services, but regardless, they try to support

201
00:15:32,795 --> 00:15:34,015
the residents.

202
00:15:34,256 --> 00:15:37,557
It's starting with the neighbors and that's why it's called neighborhood streets.

203
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:51,382
We go where we're invited and I believe we've been invited at least since April to neighborhoods that are just looking for another dining option.

204
00:15:52,062 --> 00:15:52,462
That's all.

205
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:56,424
And while also supporting small businesses.

206
00:15:57,224 --> 00:16:01,806
In addition, we are now reaching out to PTOs and PTAs

207
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:06,244
recognizing that they have very limited fundraising opportunities.

208
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:12,346
And just today, we raised several hundred dollars for a PTA in Belmont.

209
00:16:12,386 --> 00:16:14,107
And we wanted to do that in Medford.

210
00:16:14,547 --> 00:16:16,028
We respect the rules.

211
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:24,931
We understand we are simply another option, neighborhood option for residents.

212
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:26,591
And that's all we were meant to be.

213
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:31,313
And I think there are many people who will go to a restaurant, many people who will

214
00:16:32,017 --> 00:16:32,738
cook at home.

215
00:16:33,138 --> 00:16:44,970
Many people who will order a pizza and many people who might say, wouldn't it be nice to have a way to safely order, pre-order a meal, come pick it up and go home and eat it.

216
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,211
And it's cooked.

217
00:16:46,692 --> 00:16:48,594
And that's how we were meant to be.

218
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,636
I don't know if anybody has any questions for me.

219
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,411
Thank you, Anne Marie.

220
00:16:52,531 --> 00:16:56,773
And if I may, Anne Marie, just as a administrative matter, we just need your name and address.

221
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:57,673
The clerk needs your name.

222
00:16:57,774 --> 00:16:59,354
Oh, I apologize for that.

223
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:06,218
My name is Anne Marie Eigner, 66 Ralph Street, Watertown, 02472.

224
00:17:06,778 --> 00:17:13,922
And I represent Food Truck Ventures and the Neighborhood Streets Program and the Streets for Schools Program.

225
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:15,103
Thank you.

226
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:16,522
Thank you very much.

227
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:17,963
Councilor Marks.

228
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:24,530
Thank you, Mr. President, and I don't think anyone behind this reel thinks this is a bad idea.

229
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:32,777
I think what I'm hearing from my colleagues is that in the past when we approved food trucks, we always got date and location.

230
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:43,270
And I would feel more comfortable that we revisit this when there's an actual date and location of an actual truck that would like to come into the community.

231
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:49,137
And we'll take them as we've done in the past, Mr. President, each one on its own merit and move forward.

232
00:17:49,537 --> 00:18:01,825
But as this prepares tonight, just an open-ended, you know, list of potential, you know, food trucks, I couldn't support this tonight either, Mr. President.

233
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:08,089
So I would ask that the administration come back when they do have a full-fledged request.

234
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:09,450
Thank you.

235
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,130
Councilor Marks.

236
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:14,553
Okay, we have a couple of hands up here.

237
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,375
We have John from the Chamber of Commerce.

238
00:18:18,671 --> 00:18:20,012
Name and address for the record, John.

239
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:26,915
John Costas, 56 Hayne Street, business in Medford Square.

240
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:30,516
This is the first I've heard about this.

241
00:18:31,897 --> 00:18:37,619
And I really think that that's, it's kind of a disservice to all small businesses.

242
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,680
They're getting hit really, really hard now.

243
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:44,682
And they just got reduced in capacity.

244
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:46,963
They lost their outside dining.

245
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:52,365
Their only source of revenue now is takeout or in dining services.

246
00:18:53,566 --> 00:19:02,873
And to put food trucks and remote, you know, food right in the neighborhood, obviously people are going to like this because it's convenient.

247
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:03,693
It's down the street.

248
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:06,335
They can just order what they want and they walk down and pick it up.

249
00:19:07,516 --> 00:19:12,419
But food trucks should stay like it's been doing by special permit at events.

250
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,162
You need a food truck at your event, you get food trucks at your event.

251
00:19:16,897 --> 00:19:23,380
But I think to make it policy that food trucks can come and go in neighborhoods, it's just wrong.

252
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:26,222
It's really shows a lack of support.

253
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:29,144
I mean, small, modern, pop little restaurants here.

254
00:19:29,164 --> 00:19:31,405
You know, our restaurants need help.

255
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,726
And right now it's getting worse.

256
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,427
It's not getting better.

257
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:37,288
And now that winter's here.

258
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:40,690
So this is for myself personally.

259
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,952
I'm not speaking for the Chamber of Commerce on this, because the Chamber of Commerce,

260
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,985
wasn't aware this was coming up, so we did not have a discussion on it.

261
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:58,612
But as myself, a business owner in Method Square for 40 years, I really have a problem with food trucks in residential neighborhoods.

262
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:11,541
And I agree it should be reconsidered at some future date, but don't, don't hurt our, you know, brick and mortar stores at this time during this COVID period.

263
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:14,162
It's just a disservice.

264
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:14,843
Thank you.

265
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:16,596
Thank you very much.

266
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:23,120
Would anybody else like to speak on this issue that's on the Zoom call here?

267
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,361
Okay, I don't see any hands up.

268
00:20:27,642 --> 00:20:28,963
Any of the councilors want to speak on this?

269
00:20:31,504 --> 00:20:31,845
Okay.

270
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:34,706
Chair awaits a motion.

271
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:37,548
Motion received and placed on file, Mr. President.

272
00:20:37,568 --> 00:20:45,432
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Naito to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

273
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:47,839
Clark-Urnaby, please call the roll.

274
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:54,125
Councilor Bears?

275
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:54,685
No.

276
00:20:58,949 --> 00:20:59,750
Vice President Caravagno?

277
00:20:59,810 --> 00:20:59,990
Yes.

278
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:03,513
Councilor Knight?

279
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:04,334
Yes.

280
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,097
Councilor Marks?

281
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:08,718
Yes.

282
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,440
Councilor Morrell?

283
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:11,841
No.

284
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:15,742
Councilor Scarpelli?

285
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:16,262
Yes.

286
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,063
President Falco?

287
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:20,103
Yes.

288
00:21:20,123 --> 00:21:22,504
7 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.

289
00:21:22,524 --> 00:21:23,124
5 and 2.

290
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,345
I'm sorry, 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative.

291
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,146
The paper is received in place.

292
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,706
Mr. President, while we're under suspension.

293
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:34,067
Mr. President, while we're under suspension, Mr. President.

294
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:34,367
20-656.

295
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:35,228
One at a time.

296
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:37,048
Vice President Cabral.

297
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,349
Mr. President, while we're under suspension, if we could take a paper 20-656.

298
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:39,389
20-656.

299
00:21:45,423 --> 00:21:46,304
All on the same page.

300
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:16,275
Is it page 16?

301
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,278
It's literally the same page as well.

302
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:21,879
Got it.

303
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:22,460
Okay, 20656.

304
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,981
Page 16, Mr. President.

305
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:26,542
Page 16, thank you.

306
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,083
Communications from the mayor.

307
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:35,468
November 25th, 2020, to the honorable president and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

308
00:22:36,469 --> 00:22:40,392
Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend

309
00:22:41,388 --> 00:22:56,751
The city council authorized me as mayor on behalf of the city of Medford to enter into a tax increment financing, TIF, T-I-F, agreement with Monogram Gourmet Foods LLC in accordance with the Massachusetts Economic Development Incentive Program.

310
00:22:57,492 --> 00:23:03,593
and Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 23A, Chapter 40, Section 59, and Chapter 59.

311
00:23:04,113 --> 00:23:23,297
I'll be present at the meeting with members of the administration, Chief Assessor Ellen Bordeaux, Jeffrey Monica from Monogram Gourmet Foods, and Maria DeStefano from the Massachusetts Office of Business Development to discuss the agreement as well as Monogram Gourmet Foods' plan for their proposed operation in the city of Medford.

312
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:25,798
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

313
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:28,639
Sincerely, Liana Longo Kern, Mayor.

314
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,500
Vice President Carvialho.

315
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,441
Thank you, Mr. President.

316
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:35,482
I'm glad we're taking this back up again this evening.

317
00:23:37,723 --> 00:23:44,826
For the past six years, this whole community has been screaming, no more houses, no more apartments.

318
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:46,447
We want commercial development.

319
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:48,167
We want commercial development.

320
00:23:50,750 --> 00:24:00,218
Last week, we got probably the largest commercial development in the history of this community of $40 million.

321
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:02,620
That's come forward to us.

322
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:04,022
And again.

323
00:24:06,602 --> 00:24:17,330
I know there were some questions last week, and I would hope that we'd be able to work this out this evening, and hopefully vote favorably on this tonight, Mr. President.

324
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:30,540
So I await comments from my other counselors and members of the administration, and the people from Monogram Gourmet Foods also this evening.

325
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,262
So I'll await further discussion, Mr. President.

326
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:35,419
Thank you, Vice President Carviello.

327
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:36,360
We have Councilor Morrell.

328
00:24:37,781 --> 00:24:38,401
Thank you, Mr. President.

329
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:41,063
I don't know who's here to answer questions right now.

330
00:24:41,343 --> 00:24:42,744
I have some questions, I don't know.

331
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,986
Are all the same people present on this to address questions?

332
00:24:46,467 --> 00:24:48,648
Yeah, you can ask questions now if you like.

333
00:24:48,668 --> 00:24:48,828
Okay.

334
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:51,950
I have a question.

335
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,393
I know, I apologize, I didn't print out the tip.

336
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:58,014
I just have it on my phone, the actual proposed agreement.

337
00:24:58,515 --> 00:25:00,316
But I know there's the option that if the,

338
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:06,960
there's the opportunity and process to decertify the TIF.

339
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:17,946
Is there a process for through the state or I guess other measures for clawbacks if the terms of this weren't met and it were decertified?

340
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:22,829
I don't know who's on the phone.

341
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:25,350
We have, Mr. President, thank you.

342
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,331
We have Maria DeStefano from the state.

343
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,832
I think she'd probably be best to answer this question for you.

344
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:30,233
Yes.

345
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:30,673
Thank you.

346
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,370
OK, we have Maria Giuseppina.

347
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,931
I just need to unmute her.

348
00:25:36,151 --> 00:25:36,971
Yeah, I'm trying to.

349
00:25:37,051 --> 00:25:40,552
I'll try again.

350
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:51,715
Adam, do you want to try to unmute?

351
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,816
We're going to have the clerk see if he can unmute her.

352
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:54,836
I'm not having any luck.

353
00:25:57,158 --> 00:25:58,338
was a question about clawbacks.

354
00:25:59,098 --> 00:25:59,318
Yes.

355
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:00,179
Yeah.

356
00:26:00,199 --> 00:26:12,361
The question is just if, you know, if the process to decertify happens because the terms of this agreement aren't met, is there an opportunity or mechanism through the state for clawbacks or is that something that the city would have to pursue otherwise?

357
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:16,402
Or have you seen other cities do this again?

358
00:26:16,602 --> 00:26:20,343
Not that I don't want this to happen, but I'm just trying to understand what that process might look like.

359
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:22,624
She's been unmuted.

360
00:26:23,444 --> 00:26:24,444
Maria, you have the floor.

361
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:37,910
there because it is you could certainly pursue that.

362
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:41,673
I have not seen that happen.

363
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:43,515
I haven't seen that happen very often.

364
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:51,623
Typically the company is really wanting to be in that in a specific location and that municipality really wants them there.

365
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:54,606
So there's always some type of an agreement.

366
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:55,847
Have I seen sometimes

367
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:06,749
I haven't seen municipalities act in a way that they would want to decertify that project.

368
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:23,576
It would need, you know, I've seen them do it within reason, but I, you know, when something perhaps is egregious, but not in a, typically I see municipalities and companies working together to try to resolve whatever is happening.

369
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:25,117
So the answer is yes, you could,

370
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:27,323
you could certainly decertify them.

371
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:32,725
It would really be on the city to initiate that.

372
00:27:33,746 --> 00:27:35,886
It's a fairly easy process.

373
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:45,930
You send a letter to me and we get it to the EACC and we start the process and they vote on it at a policy meeting or another EACC meeting.

374
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:49,285
I'm just trying to understand what that would look like.

375
00:27:49,305 --> 00:27:49,425
Okay.

376
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:51,786
And but there's nothing prohibiting clawbacks.

377
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:53,568
If that were something that were to happen again.

378
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,568
I don't want this to happen.

379
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:58,111
I'm not speaking this, but I'm just trying to understand what that would look like.

380
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,513
So that would be initiated in the city.

381
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,935
Okay.

382
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:05,076
And then I just have one more question specifically about the tip.

383
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:05,857
I believe it says.

384
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:06,257
And again, I

385
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:21,732
So the hiring would occur over those five years to get to the total of 250.

386
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:23,694
Let's see.

387
00:28:29,221 --> 00:28:29,581
Yeah.

388
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:32,184
Yeah, this is I'm sorry.

389
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:36,489
This is Jeff Monica, vice president of Monogram Gourmet Foods.

390
00:28:37,338 --> 00:28:38,699
and based in Memphis, Tennessee.

391
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:41,239
Yes, mayor and counselors, yes.

392
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:48,842
Our commitment is to employ an additional 200, well, 250 new employees to our company in the city of Medford.

393
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:56,225
And the period of the, is through, I think it's fiscal 2026, if I'm not mistaken.

394
00:28:56,845 --> 00:29:08,361
And then I believe the chief of staff said last week, then that the terms of the TIF are so that those jobs are held at least until the end of the TIF in 2030 or I guess 2031.

395
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:10,303
Correct?

396
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:12,206
Or that's how I understood it?

397
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:13,868
Yes.

398
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:14,449
OK.

399
00:29:15,646 --> 00:29:16,627
All right, thank you.

400
00:29:16,907 --> 00:29:28,772
Councilor, I would just advise you that we will probably hire those employees within 12 months of opening the facility, which we anticipate, if the TIF is granted, could be this coming summer.

401
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:31,653
We're trying to target an August 1st start.

402
00:29:32,554 --> 00:29:37,956
If we don't have the jobs and the people hired, we're not gonna be in business.

403
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:40,717
We gotta move quickly to hire the employees.

404
00:29:40,897 --> 00:29:45,019
So we're hopeful that that'll happen in the first 12 to 24 months maximum.

405
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:45,895
OK, thank you.

406
00:29:45,915 --> 00:29:46,975
Yeah, that was my original question.

407
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:50,056
I was just trying to reflect the language I see in the actual proposed agreement.

408
00:29:51,016 --> 00:29:51,277
Thank you.

409
00:29:51,397 --> 00:29:51,917
That's all I have.

410
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,397
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

411
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:55,238
We have Councilor Behrs and Councilor Knight.

412
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:55,958
Councilor Behrs.

413
00:29:56,238 --> 00:29:57,178
Thank you, Mr. President.

414
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,179
And I want to echo Vice President Carabiello's statement.

415
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:03,960
I think it's great that we're having commercial investment in the community.

416
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,921
And I have my general concerns about TIPS as a development strategy.

417
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:12,722
But I think in this case, after review and after the questions,

418
00:30:13,641 --> 00:30:19,143
that have been asked and answered, it seems like a good move for this specific case and this specific project.

419
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:25,346
One thing I do want to add, I think 250 jobs is a great benefit to our community.

420
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:31,068
I think that that would be an even stronger benefit if many of those were union jobs.

421
00:30:31,148 --> 00:30:33,949
As we know, unionized jobs pay a higher prevailing wage.

422
00:30:34,009 --> 00:30:37,271
And that's something that we really need in this community, considering the cost of living.

423
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:42,513
So I would like to motion that the council would send the following language to the city administration

424
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:50,964
for potential inclusion in this agreement pending review by legal counsel and whatever the administration deems necessary.

425
00:30:51,445 --> 00:30:56,047
And I can read the language when the clerk is ready.

426
00:31:01,591 --> 00:31:12,477
The language will just be monogram foods will not contest any efforts by workers at this facility to unionize using card check or any other legally authorized mechanism to establish a collective bargaining unit.

427
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:12,797
And again,

428
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:19,337
sending that language over to the city administration for their review and discussion for potential inclusion in the agreement.

429
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:36,673
I was encouraged to hear from Mr. Modica that some of the facilities that Monogram operates are unionized, so I would hope that this would be more of a formality than needing to be enforced if workers were to unionize, but I do think it's important

430
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:46,169
that we try to make sure that as many jobs in our community as possible are good union jobs, where workers get the benefits of being in a collective bargaining unit.

431
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:47,950
Thank you, Mr. President.

432
00:31:48,771 --> 00:31:49,711
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

433
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:53,194
So on the motion of Councilor Peers... Would you like to amend that, Mr. President?

434
00:31:53,674 --> 00:31:58,238
Okay, so... Is that an amendment?

435
00:31:59,338 --> 00:32:04,482
It's a motion to send language to the city administration for potential inclusion in the agreement.

436
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:08,784
It's a B paper.

437
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:14,508
So on that B paper, seconded by... I have a couple of concerns about it, Mr. President.

438
00:32:14,568 --> 00:32:16,730
Seconded by Councilor Morrell, Councilor Night.

439
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:20,015
I think it needs to be reviewed by legal counsel.

440
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:30,421
And the reason I think that, Mr. President, is because we can't request that an entity or an organization waive their rights under federal law as a condition of permitting, right?

441
00:32:30,641 --> 00:32:34,724
So I think that that's something that might need legal review from Solicitor Scanlon.

442
00:32:35,444 --> 00:32:45,490
But I would like to offer a C paper, Mr. President, requesting that Monogram Foods and the administration meet with Boston Building Trades.

443
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:51,808
to discuss the potential for a project-specific labor agreement at this house, at this location for the build-out.

444
00:32:53,228 --> 00:32:55,409
And that gentleman would be Francis X. Callahan.

445
00:32:55,549 --> 00:32:57,269
He's the Chairman of the Building Trades at this point in time.

446
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:00,230
I'd offer that as a C paper, Mr. President, if this is approved and moving forward.

447
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,930
So we have a C paper offered by Council on 8.

448
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:03,571
Second.

449
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:04,891
Second by Councilor Piers.

450
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:07,951
And Mr. President, if I may.

451
00:33:09,232 --> 00:33:09,832
Councilor Piers.

452
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:14,893
Just to clarify on the B paper, absolutely pending legal council review or any other

453
00:33:16,212 --> 00:33:20,916
it would be at the administration's discretion to ask Solicitor Scanlon about the language.

454
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:22,858
So that's my intent in this motion.

455
00:33:23,098 --> 00:33:23,779
Second, Mr. President.

456
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:24,619
Thank you.

457
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,500
Councilor Morrell.

458
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:27,142
Thank you, Mr. President.

459
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:36,650
I do have one more question regarding if there is any update from the administration as far as findings regarding to the applicability of the soldier ordinance to this project and what that might look like.

460
00:33:39,332 --> 00:33:39,993
Thank you, Councilor.

461
00:33:40,073 --> 00:33:42,535
Councilor Morrell, that was to Alicia Hunt.

462
00:33:45,102 --> 00:34:01,911
I'm sorry, I wasn't available earlier to respond to this, but I am meeting with Mr. Modica from Monogram Foods on Thursday to review our solar ordinance and the requirements for it and to see how it fits with their project.

463
00:34:03,272 --> 00:34:05,774
I do believe that it's going to be applicable.

464
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:13,638
I don't see it being a huge burden on their company, but we'll be talking about it in more detail on Thursday.

465
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:17,498
And I think he has something to add.

466
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:18,418
Yeah.

467
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:19,359
I'm sorry.

468
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:19,839
I'll wait.

469
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:20,980
Yeah.

470
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:29,945
Since last week's meeting, we have engaged with our engineering team to begin looking at this pending the approval of the TIF.

471
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:39,631
The building roof has got some sloped portion and there is quite a bit of refrigeration equipment, which contains ammonia.

472
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:42,732
Um, so we'll have to look at how that would interface.

473
00:34:42,792 --> 00:34:49,035
And that caused me to schedule a meeting and work with work through Dave Rodriguez of economic development and the mayor staff.

474
00:34:49,095 --> 00:34:50,295
And we're got the team together.

475
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:56,298
I've got my engineers available tomorrow, pending the outcome tonight to meet with Alicia.

476
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:58,479
Uh, I would just tell you two other things.

477
00:34:58,579 --> 00:35:09,263
We have our meat snack plant in Chandler, Minnesota is 100% supplied electricity from 13 solar gardens that we have in the state of Minnesota.

478
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:11,646
and that's a program through XL Energy.

479
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:21,329
So we are very, if it will work and we can, structure will have supported, we will go forward and take a look at that to the best of our ability.

480
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:30,611
Remember, this is a lease building and the owner Medford Bakery Realty LLC is the actual owner of the facility.

481
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:31,612
We are a tenant.

482
00:35:32,032 --> 00:35:38,594
So they will have to be brought in once we determine applicability with working with Alicia and her team.

483
00:35:40,091 --> 00:35:42,253
That's the update since last Tuesday's meeting.

484
00:35:43,473 --> 00:35:43,874
Okay, great.

485
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:44,514
Thank you both.

486
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:47,496
Thank you, Councilor Rao.

487
00:35:47,516 --> 00:35:49,417
Councilor Layton.

488
00:35:49,718 --> 00:35:50,258
Councilor Marks.

489
00:35:50,278 --> 00:35:51,119
Thank you, Mr. President.

490
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:52,580
And I want to thank...

491
00:35:56,358 --> 00:36:05,723
This council last week tabled this request in order to notify residents of the Wellington and Haines Square area.

492
00:36:06,384 --> 00:36:08,765
And in particular, I want to thank the city administration.

493
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:17,630
They sent out a great robocall, in my opinion, alerting residents of this particular meeting how to participate, Mr. President.

494
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:23,033
And also, if they had any questions or concerns regarding this TIF

495
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:25,915
And this new establishment, a Middlesex Ave.

496
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:33,202
So I want to thank the administration and thank this council for including residents in their input.

497
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:35,584
It's very important during this process.

498
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:44,591
Mr. President, I think it was about four years ago this council voted for the only TIF that I can recall with Bianco Sausage.

499
00:36:45,312 --> 00:36:52,734
And at the time, Mr. President, their commitment to this city was to add 20 new full-time jobs.

500
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,355
And now we're looking at a commitment of 250 jobs.

501
00:36:56,915 --> 00:37:02,717
So I see this as a real job growth and economic recovery.

502
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:06,940
revitalizer, which I think will be good for the area.

503
00:37:07,521 --> 00:37:11,945
And I agree with my colleagues regarding living wages and so forth.

504
00:37:12,506 --> 00:37:16,089
And I'm sure we could probably work towards that, Mr. President.

505
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:24,874
The questions that I raised last week, I still have this week, Mr. President, and I'm going to propose them again.

506
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:36,284
And I'm not sure if we've had any time to work on some of this, but I really would like to try to pin down the potential trucking routes

507
00:37:37,485 --> 00:37:39,247
to this establishment, Mr. President.

508
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:46,834
I know we're talking about increasing business there from what currently exists.

509
00:37:47,534 --> 00:37:55,481
And I think it's important for those of us that actually surround this, there are neighborhoods around this facility.

510
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:58,324
I realize this is a commercial area.

511
00:37:58,864 --> 00:38:06,806
But it's embedded in a residential neighborhood, both the Haines Square and the Wellington neighborhood with many residents.

512
00:38:06,886 --> 00:38:28,151
So I would like to find out from maybe Mr. Moniker if he's had the ability to respond to the question that I asked last week of what potential truck routes they will be looking at, knowing that two of the major roads that exist around this area don't allow major trucking.

513
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:36,134
So in my opinion, that would disperse trucks on some of the secondary roads, and I have a concern.

514
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:40,676
So that would be my first question, Mr. President, regarding the truck routes.

515
00:38:41,217 --> 00:38:51,461
And if Mr. Monica has had the opportunity to look into it, if not, I think it's something that still requires a response, Mr. President, to this council.

516
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:52,481
Thank you, council.

517
00:38:52,501 --> 00:38:52,762
Mr. Monica.

518
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:56,449
Yes, thank you council for the question.

519
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,411
We have had a discussion.

520
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:00,492
I have actually have a representative.

521
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:04,695
One of my peers is in Boston area tonight.

522
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,636
They'll be touring the facility tomorrow.

523
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:11,659
We did look at basic traffic ingress and egress from trucks.

524
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,401
It'll all be contained to Middlesex.

525
00:39:15,462 --> 00:39:17,263
Is that Middlesex street or Middlesex road?

526
00:39:17,283 --> 00:39:18,704
I'm not sure the right name.

527
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:27,831
And the truck traffic and employee traffic will be entering on and off of Middlesex.

528
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:35,617
The only question that was raised is how difficult will it be to make a left turn out of the property onto Middlesex?

529
00:39:35,817 --> 00:39:42,662
And just coincidentally, I was talking with Mr. Rodriguez the other day and the chief of police was in his office.

530
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:48,287
So I had the unique opportunity of inquiring, are there any restrictions with what type of traffic?

531
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:53,292
do we see there, he said, you should have no problem in going in and out and Middlesex.

532
00:39:53,372 --> 00:40:05,684
And I also inquired about weight restrictions and he said, you should have no problems using Middlesex and an accessing is that highway 28, I think will be the main artery we would take.

533
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:07,765
to get out of the area.

534
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:10,487
So I don't anticipate a problem, Councilor.

535
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:15,350
Obviously we have to comply with all traffic and local weight ordinances.

536
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,611
That's common practice for any business.

537
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:19,933
So I don't anticipate that to be a problem.

538
00:40:19,973 --> 00:40:29,079
And if left turns are a problem coming out of there, we will generate a right turn only process and route our trucks down Middlesex and loop back around to 28th.

539
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,282
So that's the research we've done since your question last Tuesday night.

540
00:40:35,238 --> 00:40:40,225
Okay, I appreciate you looking into that and I thank you for your response.

541
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:50,680
The other question I had was, you mentioned originally that Monogram was going to open as two shifts with the potential of a third shift.

542
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:58,205
I know at this point you probably can't commit, but I have a concern about a potential third shift.

543
00:40:59,365 --> 00:41:09,790
And I was wondering if a third shift would require the extended hours for any business, and would that be a vote of the council?

544
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,913
This, I don't think, is a question for Mr. Modica, but I don't know who else we have on the call.

545
00:41:14,953 --> 00:41:19,275
Do we have Commissioner Moki or anyone else on the call?

546
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:27,312
Mayor Longo, current.

547
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:30,474
Mr. President, yes, we don't have Commissioner Moki on the call.

548
00:41:30,514 --> 00:41:31,274
We have Ms.

549
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:33,095
Hunt, Mr. Rodriguez.

550
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:35,096
We have our traffic engineer, Todd Blake.

551
00:41:36,984 --> 00:41:38,886
But we do not have Commissioner Mulkey.

552
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:39,786
My apologies.

553
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:40,687
Point of information, Mr. President.

554
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,927
Point of information, Councilor Layton.

555
00:41:42,088 --> 00:41:43,769
I'm going to tap it on my zoning book here.

556
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:50,413
Section 94-145, hours of operation of retail or wholesale store, factory, or manufacturing plant.

557
00:41:51,373 --> 00:42:01,019
A, no retail or wholesale store, factory, or manufacturing plant shall conduct business or operate in a single family general residence, apartment, commercial, or industrial zone between the hours of 11 p.m.

558
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,559
and 7 a.m.

559
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,526
A special permit to extend those hours of operation between 11 and 7 may be granted by the council provided in section 9481.

560
00:42:09,908 --> 00:42:14,253
So it appears that the extended hours permit would be applicable in this instance.

561
00:42:15,374 --> 00:42:18,037
Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for bringing that up.

562
00:42:23,117 --> 00:42:23,738
That was helpful.

563
00:42:23,778 --> 00:42:33,226
So Mr. President, knowing that this would require a special permit of the council, I think eases some of the concern I have regarding a third shift.

564
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,448
I'm not saying I'm opposed to a third shift.

565
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:41,193
I realize that the previous business, I believe, did have a third shift, an active third shift there.

566
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:49,356
But that eases some of my concerns of residents that I spoke to regarding potential trucking at 1, 2, 3 in the morning.

567
00:42:49,796 --> 00:43:00,359
And we all know when 18 wheelers go by your house and hit the many potholes we have on our roads and the many divots we have, that it shakes homes and so forth, Mr. President.

568
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:02,260
So that's comforting to know.

569
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:09,044
My third point, Mr. President, and I brought this up last week, and it's a major concern, Mr. President.

570
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:14,367
Middlesex Ave, and I don't have to tell anyone behind this reel, is a disgrace.

571
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:22,392
The sidewalk, the road, the lighting, everything on that road is a complete and utter disgrace.

572
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:31,137
There hasn't been any attention, I've been in the area for almost 30 years now, and there hasn't been any attention to that road since I've been here.

573
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:32,617
And that's no lie.

574
00:43:33,297 --> 00:44:01,203
And I realize it's a state road, and I'm hoping with this partnership through an act of state legislation, which is the TIF agreement, that we could get a commitment similar to what we received just recently from the Department of Transportation regarding the corner of Main Street and South Street, Mr. President, that the city administration, Todd Blake, the city engineer,

575
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:10,687
sit and meet with the State Department of Transportation, Mr. President, and put together a full-fledged plan.

576
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:23,152
We're talking about $40 million in renovation, and equipment, and a new establishment, and yet we're talking $0 about infrastructure.

577
00:44:24,026 --> 00:44:27,849
I mean, I think it speaks volume about what we need to address.

578
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:29,990
And it is that road, Mr. President.

579
00:44:31,091 --> 00:44:33,272
And I would just like to put that out there.

580
00:44:33,312 --> 00:44:37,955
I believe the mayor said that we had the traffic engineer, Todd Blake, on tonight.

581
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:43,299
I went through this about a month and a half ago with the BJ's gas station.

582
00:44:43,819 --> 00:44:48,583
One of the major concerns was the exiting from BJ's location.

583
00:44:49,463 --> 00:44:59,753
And again, it was stated, I believe Todd Blake was on the calls, that they would look at the exiting of that particular parking lot.

584
00:45:00,053 --> 00:45:01,915
This is no different, this is a door down.

585
00:45:02,356 --> 00:45:03,857
This is no different, Mr. President.

586
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:08,622
And I think if we're going to talk about $40 million in this commitment,

587
00:45:09,482 --> 00:45:11,804
It should go hand in hand with improvements to that road.

588
00:45:12,164 --> 00:45:21,749
So I'd like to hear from the traffic engineer and the city engineer regarding what the next steps are and potentially how the state.

589
00:45:22,149 --> 00:45:25,431
I'm sorry, is it DeStefano, the woman from the state?

590
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:26,772
Yes.

591
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:38,599
May be able to get involved on an infrastructure type if indeed they do get involved in moving this forward where she is from the state, Mr. President.

592
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,260
Councilor Matz, who would you like to hear from first?

593
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:42,522
Either one, Mr. President.

594
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:47,486
Okay, so Mr. Stefano is right in front of me here, so I will unmute.

595
00:45:48,466 --> 00:45:49,207
I'll try to unmute you.

596
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:50,028
There we go, okay.

597
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:52,469
Thank you, Council President.

598
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:53,530
Thank you, Councilor.

599
00:45:53,891 --> 00:45:59,095
Certainly, I am happy to sit down with, well, whether it's in person or via email.

600
00:46:01,289 --> 00:46:07,711
I'm happy to sit down with the mayor, with Mr. Rodriguez, with Alicia, whomever I can.

601
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:12,313
And we can talk about, there's several, there's an infrastructure program for the state.

602
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:15,054
We can also make connections with MassDOT.

603
00:46:15,134 --> 00:46:16,994
I'm happy to help in whatever way I can.

604
00:46:18,995 --> 00:46:19,835
Thank you, Mr. President.

605
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,236
Maybe if we can hear from the city.

606
00:46:21,556 --> 00:46:22,796
Yes, absolutely.

607
00:46:23,296 --> 00:46:25,397
I think Todd, I thought I saw Todd Blake on the line.

608
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:27,578
I got him, Mr. President.

609
00:46:27,598 --> 00:46:28,318
He's on mute.

610
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:30,805
Hi, how are you doing, everyone?

611
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:33,366
Todd Blake, Traffic Engineer for City Manager.

612
00:46:34,587 --> 00:46:52,673
So council members, thank you for your comments on good points, and I think there'll be other opportunities as we move forward through that permit process you referenced to address these things, but it's a good point to point out to us to get in touch with the state and talk about possible improvements, whether it's related to this or otherwise.

613
00:46:55,848 --> 00:47:03,794
So, Todd, while we have you, I know you were involved with the BJ's gas station as part of the conversation.

614
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:12,660
Can you shed some light on what improvements, if any, are going to take place due to the recent approval of the BJ's gas station?

615
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,361
Yeah, no problem.

616
00:47:15,942 --> 00:47:25,008
So for the BJ's gas station project, we requested that, as part of the permit process, we recommended and requested that they improve

617
00:47:25,715 --> 00:47:31,839
pedestrian and bicycle access to that facility, because it was built so long ago, it was very car-centric.

618
00:47:32,399 --> 00:47:41,464
So they were upgrading the sidewalk, I believe, along the frontage of their establishment, and also from Middlesex to their front door.

619
00:47:42,305 --> 00:47:51,270
And they were also adding bike lanes and bike sharrows, subject to state approval on the state road.

620
00:47:53,242 --> 00:48:14,271
Just to clarify for folks, because it's a gas station, the mitigation for the ped bike was to try to offset the possible additional car traffic, vehicle traffic, by switching the short existing trips to BJ's from car to pedestrian bike that might be shorter trips to potentially offset.

621
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:20,614
That's how, because it's counterintuitive to some people, it's a gas station wide pedestrian bicycles, but it's in the hope to

622
00:48:21,618 --> 00:48:28,444
have a mode shift of existing short trips to BJ's to offset potentially additional car traffic.

623
00:48:29,525 --> 00:48:29,725
Right.

624
00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:31,726
So Todd, just to fill me in.

625
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:38,652
So is that commitment based on a commitment between BJ's and the Department of Transportation?

626
00:48:38,972 --> 00:48:39,913
How does that work?

627
00:48:41,314 --> 00:48:42,916
So whatever's on the site,

628
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:48,110
Well, it was all permitted through the permit process, but whatever's on the site is through the city permit.

629
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:52,052
Whatever's on the state road is subject to their approval as well.

630
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:55,953
So it's approved locally, but then it also has to get approved by the state.

631
00:48:56,293 --> 00:49:05,017
Similar to local stream improvements related to development over there, where we recommend improvements on local street, but also at the intersection that the state owns.

632
00:49:05,557 --> 00:49:11,640
So we approved it local, or the boards approved it locally, and then it's subject to the state approval as well.

633
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:23,347
Okay, so any commitment that's on Middlesex Ave would be a commitment of DOT, correct?

634
00:49:23,487 --> 00:49:43,038
No, in the BJ's case, if that's what you're asking, the BJ's would be, if they get approved by the state, and another example is the Logan Street example, if the permit process included something in those permits, those examples, they constructed the improvements on state property with states.

635
00:49:44,742 --> 00:49:49,984
So what you're telling me is then eventually Monogram is going to have to go through the approval process.

636
00:49:50,725 --> 00:50:05,671
And during that process, a similar agreement that was made with BJ's regarding the licensing and so forth will most likely take place with Monogram in the city regarding any safety concerns on Middlesex Ave.

637
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:12,554
And I would imagine there would be opportunity to revisit that during that process.

638
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,044
I wouldn't want to say what exactly that process is at this point.

639
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:19,146
I'd defer to Paul and Alicia.

640
00:50:21,928 --> 00:50:38,251
So I guess what I'm trying to do, and I don't feel warm and fuzzy from your response, I'm trying to figure out whose responsibility is it to make sure that Middlesex Ave gets the needed improvements during this approval of a $40 million project.

641
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:46,613
As we heard from Vice President Caviello, it's probably one of the larger endeavors that this city has seen, and I don't hear any infrastructure mentions.

642
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:56,230
And I find that hard to believe that we're not discussing infrastructure improvements during such a large project.

643
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:04,122
Is that for me as well?

644
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:09,871
Anyone from the administration that would like to handle that?

645
00:51:10,171 --> 00:51:22,958
I just would like to hear some more concrete information on what potentially negotiations will exist, what meetings are going to be called, what's going to happen to that roadway.

646
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:25,580
Has anyone walked down that roadway?

647
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,222
Am I the only one that's ever walked down Middlesex Ave?

648
00:51:29,402 --> 00:51:30,703
It's a complete nightmare.

649
00:51:31,023 --> 00:51:31,543
It really is.

650
00:51:31,563 --> 00:51:32,744
It's a complete nightmare.

651
00:51:33,404 --> 00:51:33,805
Walk down.

652
00:51:34,918 --> 00:51:43,384
We have a scheduled meeting with MassDOT District 4 on another matter that everyone's interested in, Maine itself.

653
00:51:43,464 --> 00:51:49,348
So whenever we meet with them, we'll take the opportunity to discuss possible improvements on any state roads.

654
00:51:49,788 --> 00:51:55,632
We work all the time with MassDOT and DCR to get improvements wherever we can, whenever we can.

655
00:51:56,173 --> 00:52:01,737
You know, recent examples with DCR on Felsway West, Bump House, and that neighborhood.

656
00:52:02,722 --> 00:52:16,111
you know, so we will have the opportunity very soon to talk with Matthew and touch base upon, you know, the condition of Middlesex Avenue and our request.

657
00:52:16,712 --> 00:52:19,774
If I may, Council Members, I think may have a longer hand up.

658
00:52:20,114 --> 00:52:20,694
Yes, I know.

659
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:21,115
I think Ms.

660
00:52:21,595 --> 00:52:27,519
Hunt has something to add, but I just want to just reassure you with Maria's help and our

661
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:30,733
we're not looking for improvements for monogram, but as

662
00:52:48,234 --> 00:52:57,197
I think you have more department heads on here than I announced earlier, many more, but we will work together to try to get some much-needed improvements to Middlesex Avenue.

663
00:52:57,457 --> 00:52:58,397
Point of information, Mr. President?

664
00:52:58,977 --> 00:53:00,378
Point of information, Councilman Knight.

665
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:03,058
It appears that this project would be subject to linkage fees.

666
00:53:03,078 --> 00:53:10,221
Would the administration be willing to dedicate the linkage fees that are generated through this project for improvements to Middlesex Avenue for partnering with the state in making those improvements?

667
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:11,481
May I long occur?

668
00:53:20,178 --> 00:53:20,718
I'm miss hunt.

669
00:53:20,959 --> 00:53:24,361
If you want to help me with this, but with regards to linkage fees and then I can.

670
00:53:25,882 --> 00:53:28,383
I would be happy to speak to the linkage fees question.

671
00:53:29,444 --> 00:53:35,188
So I would have to examine whether or not linkage fees are going to be levied on this.

672
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:42,112
But what I can tell you is that linkage fees, the linkage funds that we have do not, um,

673
00:53:43,267 --> 00:53:47,150
have to be spent directly at that moment.

674
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,352
So we actually have a linkage account that can be used.

675
00:53:50,573 --> 00:53:53,815
The difficulty here is that it's a state road.

676
00:53:54,075 --> 00:54:11,048
We've been developing very excellent relationships with MassDOT over the past 11 months, and we feel very confident that we can have a conversation with them about improvements to Middlesex Ave and who would be paying for such improvements.

677
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:32,699
And in fact, as part of the BJ's commitment through the site plan review process that was being required of them through the community development board, is that they will be paying for the bike lane improvements, all and restriping of Middlesex Ave, inclusive of the area in front of this development.

678
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:37,228
as part of their approval, pending approval with MassDOT.

679
00:54:37,768 --> 00:54:44,370
We don't think it'll be hard to get the improvement for MassDOT to have the private company pay for this striping.

680
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:51,373
We haven't worked our way through the entire conversation with them, but we feel that that will go forward.

681
00:54:51,813 --> 00:55:02,737
We can also have a conversation with MassDOT about the application of linkage funds that we have for this area and for improving that road

682
00:55:03,223 --> 00:55:13,110
if that would be of assistance in getting MassDOT to approve the improvements, as you're saying, to this area.

683
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,631
We'll also be working with- So you have no question, Mr. President.

684
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:19,394
Yes, linkage fees apply, and yes, we'll be willing to do it, and no, we won't.

685
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:19,914
You know what I mean?

686
00:55:19,934 --> 00:55:21,976
That's as simple as I'm looking at you, Mr. President.

687
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:26,499
So if they apply, yes, we would absolutely bring them to this location.

688
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:29,781
Okay, why would linkage fees not apply at this location?

689
00:55:30,797 --> 00:55:33,399
So linkage fees apply for new development.

690
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,481
And this is a renovation.

691
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,563
And so it is unclear to me.

692
00:55:37,703 --> 00:55:39,424
Renovation over a certain size.

693
00:55:39,564 --> 00:55:39,824
Right.

694
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:47,471
A substantial reservation in excess of 50% of the structure that's 10,000 square feet, which is what this project is, I believe, based upon what was presented.

695
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:54,677
So Paul Mopey and I need to be having a conversation about exactly what is going to be applying to this location.

696
00:55:55,757 --> 00:56:00,041
But regardless of that, we can use money in the linkage account for

697
00:56:00,609 --> 00:56:04,053
for repair for improvements at this location.

698
00:56:04,433 --> 00:56:09,598
Depending on whether we can use any linkage on a state road.

699
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:20,710
That is something that we're going to have to clarify because it is not clear to me that we could use any municipal funds on a state road regardless of their source.

700
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:31,996
And we actually cannot require a company, a business of any kind to do improvements to a state road without the state agreeing to it.

701
00:56:32,377 --> 00:56:32,597
Right.

702
00:56:32,637 --> 00:56:45,666
But we can't partner with the state, just like we've seen neighbors in Malden do, for example, when they partially funded a study for the reconfiguration of the Highland Avenue-Fells Way intersection there.

703
00:56:46,106 --> 00:56:48,628
And the city put up some money to do the traffic study.

704
00:56:48,648 --> 00:56:50,049
And once the traffic study was complete,

705
00:56:50,429 --> 00:56:53,110
the state kicked up the money to do the repairs.

706
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,070
So- And that, yes, absolutely.

707
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:58,491
And that was a MassDCR partnership.

708
00:56:58,791 --> 00:57:00,771
And this is a MassDOT road.

709
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,932
So the MassDCR partnership program won't work here.

710
00:57:03,972 --> 00:57:07,492
We'll have to talk to MassDOT and see what they're open to.

711
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:12,053
If I might add, we have a precedent.

712
00:57:12,093 --> 00:57:14,414
We have worked on similar projects in other cities.

713
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:24,294
We have paid to move a curb cut because of that local city traffic engineer said, let's move that curb cut 50 feet to the west or to the east.

714
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:25,695
So we will be cooperative.

715
00:57:26,296 --> 00:57:32,581
Obviously we have to fund our part, which is on our property that we're leasing, but we're going to be smart about that.

716
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:38,125
We do not want a conflict with traffic with the neighboring property, BJ's or any of the residential.

717
00:57:38,165 --> 00:57:44,250
So we will be supportive of whatever Alicia and the state would like us to do within reason.

718
00:57:46,935 --> 00:57:48,335
Councilor Marks, you had the floor.

719
00:57:48,776 --> 00:57:49,776
Thank you, Mr. President.

720
00:57:49,796 --> 00:57:54,297
I know my colleagues have other questions, too, so I'll be brief.

721
00:57:55,037 --> 00:58:05,380
I just want to make sure, Mr. President, and it sounds like the city has given this some consideration on looking at some of the infrastructure that exists, in particular, Middlesex Ave.

722
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,281
So I do feel comfortable, Mr. President.

723
00:58:08,961 --> 00:58:14,283
As a community, we can no longer sit back and state that, oh, I'm sorry, this is a state road.

724
00:58:14,603 --> 00:58:15,483
We can't do anything.

725
00:58:15,943 --> 00:58:27,454
Because it's difficult to tell a taxpayer when they're paying $8,000 in taxes that, sorry, we can't touch your tree, we can't trim your tree, we can't do your sidewalk, and we have nothing to do with your road.

726
00:58:27,875 --> 00:58:33,761
That's very difficult, Mr. President, and I think these conversations have to be had when we have the opportunity.

727
00:58:34,181 --> 00:58:38,364
And a $40 million renovation, in my opinion, is the time to do it.

728
00:58:38,864 --> 00:58:48,209
And I hope the city keeps us informed regarding what the next steps are on state road improvements, in particular Middlesex Ave.

729
00:58:48,910 --> 00:59:00,717
Regarding the TIF agreement itself, Mr. President, and this may be a question for Chief of Staff Rodriguez, is there language in there that would state that there's a 90 day notice

730
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:10,073
of any corporate decision to change the nature or the character of their business operations to notify the city?

731
00:59:11,195 --> 00:59:12,819
Is there any language that speaks to that?

732
00:59:14,142 --> 00:59:18,786
We're taking a quick review right now, but I don't recall that being as part of it.

733
00:59:19,587 --> 00:59:25,352
I think Maria can weigh in on that sort of structural change to a TIF agreement after it's approved by the EACC.

734
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:27,374
They're generally made with the entity itself.

735
00:59:28,155 --> 00:59:37,684
I don't think there's a change in purpose language that's in there, but Maria can expand on whether she's seen that language included before that process worked out.

736
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:48,026
So Mr. President, I had the opportunity to look at a few recent TIF agreements, and they had language that stated just that.

737
00:59:48,606 --> 01:00:05,077
So I thought it would be helpful that when and if and when we put this agreement together, and I would just state this as a motion, that the administration add a 90-day notice of any corporate decision to change the nature and or character

738
01:00:06,116 --> 01:00:11,049
of their business operations that they notified the city of Medford.

739
01:00:12,211 --> 01:00:18,135
And naturally, if the attorney has to put that, that's just language that I jotted down quickly.

740
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,577
So I would offer that in the form of a motion, Mr. President.

741
01:00:22,357 --> 01:00:36,867
Also that if there's not already currently that exist, and again, this would be a question for Mr. Rodriguez, that annual reports on job creation, retention of Method residents be provided to us.

742
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:43,683
as the city of Medford, and I'm not sure if that language currently exists or something similar.

743
01:00:43,703 --> 01:00:45,227
It doesn't have to be the exact.

744
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:50,034
Yeah, it's in section 70 of the agreement.

745
01:00:50,214 --> 01:00:52,536
Okay, so we can eliminate that, Mr. President.

746
01:00:53,057 --> 01:00:59,382
And then I think as Councilor Morrell mentioned, there should be language in there within the TIF agreement.

747
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:03,246
Failure to comply will result in decertification.

748
01:01:04,307 --> 01:01:07,630
Somewhere that should be listed within the TIF agreement itself.

749
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:18,200
Mr. President, and I'm not sure if that's currently in there now, but I would recommend if it's not, that that be a motion as well, Mr. President.

750
01:01:20,324 --> 01:01:21,344
It is also included, Councilor.

751
01:01:21,524 --> 01:01:21,945
That's off.

752
01:01:22,165 --> 01:01:25,846
So it would be just- Thank you, Mr. Chief of Staff.

753
01:01:26,446 --> 01:01:37,669
So it would be just that one motion, Mr. President, that the 90 day notice, if there's any change in their business nature or character of their business, that they notify the city, Mr. President.

754
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:40,550
And that's it for now.

755
01:01:40,590 --> 01:01:40,910
Thank you.

756
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:41,970
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

757
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:47,512
So that will be a D paper on the motion of Councilor Marks and the D paper seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

758
01:01:49,007 --> 01:01:51,068
So we have a number of councils that want to speak.

759
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:55,931
Next up is Councilor Knight, Councilor Scott Kelly, Councilor Barrett, Councilor Knight.

760
01:01:57,652 --> 01:01:58,912
Mr. President, thank you very much.

761
01:01:58,952 --> 01:02:02,935
And Mr. Monica, I want to thank you for your patience in going through this process.

762
01:02:03,135 --> 01:02:08,077
I know it's quite an initiation to the Memphis City Council that you've taken over the past couple of weeks.

763
01:02:08,177 --> 01:02:12,680
And I as one council want to say, number one, it's great to see that your company wants to invest here.

764
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:16,162
Ultimately, there is zero jobs at this location now.

765
01:02:17,345 --> 01:02:28,181
And with the approval of this TIF, we have the ability to bring 250 jobs to our community, plus the construction jobs that are going to be related to it, plus we're going to be able to redevelop an underutilized site.

766
01:02:28,762 --> 01:02:31,987
And from my discussions with the city assessor,

767
01:02:32,507 --> 01:02:35,569
If nothing happens at this property, then we don't lose anything, right?

768
01:02:35,589 --> 01:02:39,731
I mean, right now, it is what it is based upon the way the tip is structured.

769
01:02:41,332 --> 01:02:45,234
In order for us to move forward on this, we're going to be in a much better place than we are today.

770
01:02:45,894 --> 01:02:47,775
So why is one councilor uncomfortable supporting this?

771
01:02:48,815 --> 01:02:55,239
I think we've raised a lot of issues, A paper, B paper, C paper, D paper at this point, Mr. President, and they're all valid, valid concerns.

772
01:03:00,502 --> 01:03:07,563
more focused, not necessarily on the merits of the organization or the business that's going to be done, but the application in the seamless transition.

773
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:18,937
to a renovation of a site that's located in the neighborhood and our ability to make sure that those that are responsible and accountable to make sure that certain aspects of this job go right do.

774
01:03:20,078 --> 01:03:27,782
So when we talk about linkage and we talk about the solar ordinance, we're talking about items that we want the applicant to know about and know what they're getting into.

775
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,244
So with that being said, Mr. President,

776
01:03:31,304 --> 01:03:33,806
This evening, I'm very comfortable voting to support this TIF.

777
01:03:33,867 --> 01:03:35,648
I think we've done a good job vetting it.

778
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:45,177
We've taken the opportunity to open our eyes and our ears to the neighborhood and the neighbor's concerns, while also examining the economic benefits that it's going to bring to the city.

779
01:03:45,857 --> 01:03:50,822
So I, as one councilor, will be supporting this paper this evening, and I would move forward for approval.

780
01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:53,384
Board of Information, Mr. President.

781
01:03:53,504 --> 01:03:54,285
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

782
01:03:56,093 --> 01:04:01,215
So on the motion to approve the paper, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, Councilor Marks.

783
01:04:02,075 --> 01:04:04,816
Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate that comment.

784
01:04:05,516 --> 01:04:13,459
However, we did notify thousands of Method residents of this meeting, and we have yet to hear.

785
01:04:13,579 --> 01:04:22,823
I know we started off with the council, so I look eager to hear from residents and maybe some of the concerns that may exist out there, Mr. President, as well.

786
01:04:23,983 --> 01:04:27,566
And everyone will have an opportunity to ask their questions, make their comments.

787
01:04:27,586 --> 01:04:30,528
I have a couple more councilors that would like to speak on this issue.

788
01:04:30,928 --> 01:04:33,650
We have Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Behrs.

789
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,931
Councilor Scarpelli.

790
01:04:35,991 --> 01:04:36,812
Thank you, Mr. President.

791
01:04:37,012 --> 01:04:39,654
I appreciate Councilor Moxx for bringing that point up.

792
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:48,960
I think that's the last piece that, as we go through this process, that I want to applaud because I think that the word was,

793
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:51,963
distributed to that area.

794
01:04:52,163 --> 01:04:54,347
I think that the administration did their due diligence.

795
01:04:54,767 --> 01:04:56,530
I think this council did their due diligence.

796
01:04:58,332 --> 01:05:06,003
I think that we are moving forward in a position where bringing jobs, especially possible unionized jobs, to our community.

797
01:05:06,063 --> 01:05:06,604
I think we've

798
01:05:07,345 --> 01:05:12,228
We have hit every target that we were put in this place to do.

799
01:05:12,348 --> 01:05:17,031
So I appreciate Mr. Moniker and his team for choosing Medford.

800
01:05:17,271 --> 01:05:22,174
I think that everything seems to be in a positive outlook.

801
01:05:22,234 --> 01:05:26,256
I think the administration has done a great job following through with this process.

802
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:37,064
As my fellow colleagues have already mentioned, I will be supporting this unless I hear something really drastic from our neighbors.

803
01:05:37,104 --> 01:05:45,591
But I think that Council Marks really hit a nerve when he talks about Middlesex Ave and a forgotten road by our state.

804
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:53,256
And what other way to do it as an elected official with probably one of the major

805
01:05:54,797 --> 01:06:01,799
issues and development growth areas that we'll see there for years.

806
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:11,781
So using that as some leverage to make sure the state and our city administration understands there is a viable neighborhood that really needs some attention.

807
01:06:11,841 --> 01:06:19,583
So again, I thank Mr. Moniker and I look forward to seeing the jobs and the possible

808
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:25,145
you know, money going through our businesses in that area as well.

809
01:06:25,205 --> 01:06:26,225
So thank you so much.

810
01:06:26,485 --> 01:06:29,447
And again, I look forward to the residents discussion.

811
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:31,567
Thank you.

812
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:32,728
Thank you, Mr. President.

813
01:06:32,928 --> 01:06:36,009
I actually do have a couple of questions on Middlesex Avenue.

814
01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:47,754
The first one is for Director Hunt or Engineer Blake, which is, is Middlesex Avenue on any schedule or list for upgrades or repair by MassDOT already?

815
01:06:52,733 --> 01:06:54,493
I, Todd, do you know?

816
01:06:54,513 --> 01:06:57,474
I don't have any list from MassDOT.

817
01:06:57,494 --> 01:06:58,214
Maybe you have it?

818
01:06:58,454 --> 01:07:02,315
We have Tim McGiver with us.

819
01:07:02,335 --> 01:07:05,955
Besides the Wellington Circle study, I'm not aware of others.

820
01:07:06,435 --> 01:07:07,556
City Engineer, Tim McGiver.

821
01:07:09,096 --> 01:07:09,956
Hi, good evening, Council.

822
01:07:10,996 --> 01:07:15,557
So there is some improvements that are slated by MassDOT on Middlesex Avenue.

823
01:07:16,397 --> 01:07:21,278
I don't have them right in front of me, but I believe it's second, third,

824
01:07:22,306 --> 01:07:23,287
4th and 5th Avenue.

825
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:28,830
I might have got that wrong, but there's four to five intersections that they'll be doing pedestrian upgrades.

826
01:07:29,231 --> 01:07:32,013
I thought it was actually going to happen this season, but it looks like it's going to happen next season.

827
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:35,295
Would that include resurfacing, Tim?

828
01:07:36,287 --> 01:07:43,291
No, I think the project is very focused on ADA compliance and improving the pedestrian ramps at those four intersections.

829
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:48,534
Again, I can follow up the exact list of intersections, but it's along that stretch.

830
01:07:48,715 --> 01:07:49,355
That would be helpful.

831
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:49,915
Thanks, Tim.

832
01:07:50,075 --> 01:07:53,317
And then this general question for all three of you as well.

833
01:07:54,790 --> 01:08:03,997
And we just haven't brought it up, but the MBTA right-of-way, there's a train right-of-way that runs right next to this property, actually between BJ's and this property.

834
01:08:04,037 --> 01:08:04,718
It's very old.

835
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:08,180
It's the old Medford Branch Railway that used to come down into Medford Square.

836
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:12,143
If you go on Park Street, there's a bridge, and there's a bridge over the Fellsway.

837
01:08:13,524 --> 01:08:15,566
It's just kind of a pet interest of mine.

838
01:08:16,086 --> 01:08:23,152
Is there any discussion about use or reuse of that right-of-way that's been mentioned to any city department, as far as you know?

839
01:08:24,195 --> 01:08:38,867
There is, and Alicia can speak more to the detail of it, there was an exploration of using that for a pedestrian crossover to get out of the Wellington neighborhood, basically, and more of a direct pedestrian connection to the Wellington station.

840
01:08:38,887 --> 01:08:47,794
But I believe that is not going to be happening because the owners of that bridge that goes across the tracks don't want that to happen.

841
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:51,557
And Alicia can speak more details of that particular finding.

842
01:08:51,937 --> 01:08:53,819
Is that, sorry, just quick clarification.

843
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:55,421
Is that the bridge on the Felsway or?

844
01:08:55,441 --> 01:08:58,304
The bridge that goes over the tracks, over the orange lines.

845
01:08:58,404 --> 01:08:59,465
It's actually not a bridge.

846
01:08:59,585 --> 01:09:02,388
It's the orange line dips down underneath the spur.

847
01:09:02,668 --> 01:09:03,789
Yeah, it connects to the orange line.

848
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:04,350
Got it.

849
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:04,670
Thank you.

850
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:06,112
And thanks, Alicia, in advance.

851
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:28,227
Right, we have, so, Mr. Councilor, we have been looking at that for quite a while, that spur, and we've talked to some groups, including Bikes to the Sea, and Walk Medford, and the Bike Commission, about looking at a project to turn that spur into a pedestrian and bicycle path.

852
01:09:28,527 --> 01:09:34,428
We thought that we could actually cross the orange line there at First Street,

853
01:09:34,848 --> 01:09:45,293
But it turns out that there is, in fact, still use of an old train line on top of that that runs above the Orange Line underpass.

854
01:09:45,834 --> 01:09:48,515
And it's an active use, about twice a day.

855
01:09:48,535 --> 01:09:53,978
So we can't cross right there, but we're still looking at whether that spur

856
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:58,702
would be something that we can make into a bike and pedestrian path.

857
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:13,537
I know that the residential developer there behind the property next to BJ's, it's building condominium buildings, is actually interested in working with us to turn that into a shared use path.

858
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:24,774
and potentially a walking path under 28 if we can figure out if that's gonna be possible at the other end, on the opposite end of that property.

859
01:10:25,114 --> 01:10:29,877
But it is something that is on our list of potential future projects.

860
01:10:29,937 --> 01:10:37,341
We just haven't had the, frankly, the manpower to invest in developing that further over the past year or so.

861
01:10:38,329 --> 01:10:41,532
I appreciate you indulging me and asking these questions.

862
01:10:41,592 --> 01:10:50,539
And my last one, is there any non-bike or pedestrian or any light rail or heavy rail potential for that right-of-way that's been mentioned or discussed?

863
01:10:53,922 --> 01:10:55,463
It seems very unlikely.

864
01:10:56,164 --> 01:10:56,424
Got it.

865
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:57,224
Thank you very much.

866
01:10:58,485 --> 01:10:58,806
Okay.

867
01:10:58,846 --> 01:10:59,726
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

868
01:11:00,747 --> 01:11:02,989
Any other questions from the council before we open it up to the public?

869
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:03,790
Okay.

870
01:11:05,404 --> 01:11:08,146
Let's see, would anyone like to speak on this issue?

871
01:11:08,186 --> 01:11:10,008
We'll start off with John.

872
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:12,370
Can I mute you?

873
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:15,152
Trying to unmute you now.

874
01:11:16,533 --> 01:11:17,433
John, you have two minutes.

875
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:18,975
Okay.

876
01:11:19,795 --> 01:11:34,767
Well, John, president of the Medford Chamber of Commerce, and I think that the 40 years I've been in Medford Square doing business, I think this opportunity is fantastic, and it's not something that comes around very frequently.

877
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:41,602
The Chamber of Commerce supports it, and I'd like to read a letter into the record.

878
01:11:43,443 --> 01:11:55,888
To the Honorable City Council, the Medford Chamber of Commerce supports the mayor's proposal for a TIF in favor of Monogamy and Gourmet Food to take over the old Venom Circus location on Middlesex Ave.

879
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:59,390
This building has been vacant for at least two years.

880
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:17,828
And having a well-respected company invest $40 million in this building for the next 50 years is a win for Medford, which includes the residents of the area, since the company will only be operating limited shifts rather than 24-7, as was the case with Bread and Circus.

881
01:12:19,429 --> 01:12:26,693
The number of job opportunities Monogram Gourmet Food would generate is valuable, especially under the current COVID conditions.

882
01:12:27,499 --> 01:12:30,420
and having them favoring Medford residents is a plus.

883
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:39,062
Opportunities like this do not come around every day and not to support this proposal would be a disservice to the community.

884
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:48,225
The community would gain much more than tax breaks and is very little to ask for considering the great return on the city's investment.

885
01:12:49,194 --> 01:12:54,356
To reiterate, we would like very much for the Memphis City Council to support this proposal.

886
01:12:55,677 --> 01:13:00,819
It was exciting when I heard about it last week, and it's still exciting today.

887
01:13:01,059 --> 01:13:03,040
So please consider the proposal.

888
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:03,680
Thank you.

889
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,620
John, thank you very much.

890
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,082
Appreciate it.

891
01:13:08,182 --> 01:13:08,702
Anyone else?

892
01:13:08,882 --> 01:13:10,743
Is there anyone else that would like to speak on this matter?

893
01:13:29,542 --> 01:13:32,423
So while we're looking for people, we have Mayalongo Kern.

894
01:13:34,084 --> 01:13:36,985
If nobody else has any comments, I just want to

895
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:38,038
Thank you very much.

896
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:38,499
Thank you.

897
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:40,961
Thank the for all your due diligence this past week.

898
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:48,608
I know a lot of you have been working with us on the robocall as well as in and out of the office to ask questions and to lend your support.

899
01:13:49,289 --> 01:13:52,071
We thank Mister Monica for coming to the city of

900
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:05,969
invest $40 million into our community and create 250 jobs where Medford's unemployment rate is up over 8% is invaluable.

901
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:08,632
And we look forward to getting started on this project.

902
01:14:08,713 --> 01:14:11,756
I will be present during the state meeting on Friday.

903
01:14:11,776 --> 01:14:13,057
I look forward to it.

904
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:16,261
And I want to thank the team, the entire team, our city assessor.

905
01:14:16,728 --> 01:14:27,015
our chief financial officer, city engineer, office of community development, my chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez, Jackie Peeks, Maria DeStefano from the state.

906
01:14:28,356 --> 01:14:36,541
This is a great example of collaboration among the city, the state, and the city council, and I thank you for that, and welcome, Mr. Modica, hopefully.

907
01:14:38,022 --> 01:14:41,905
It sounds very positive that you'll be a partner here in Medford, and we appreciate that.

908
01:14:43,826 --> 01:14:44,646
We are excited.

909
01:14:44,726 --> 01:14:49,008
Thank you for all the, thank you for your consideration and the council as well.

910
01:14:49,048 --> 01:14:54,511
We appreciate the opportunity and we think this will be a great partnership for many years to come.

911
01:14:56,572 --> 01:14:57,412
Thank you very much.

912
01:14:57,972 --> 01:14:59,193
I'll just check one more time.

913
01:14:59,213 --> 01:15:01,754
Would anybody else like to speak on this before we call the roll?

914
01:15:01,774 --> 01:15:07,057
Okay, do you see anyone?

915
01:15:07,917 --> 01:15:08,237
Okay.

916
01:15:10,924 --> 01:15:11,884
Vice President Cabrera.

917
01:15:12,365 --> 01:15:13,505
Oh, move the question.

918
01:15:13,565 --> 01:15:13,685
Okay.

919
01:15:14,226 --> 01:15:15,806
So we have a number of papers before us.

920
01:15:16,227 --> 01:15:17,727
Okay.

921
01:15:17,928 --> 01:15:20,809
We have a D paper that was offered by Councilor Marks.

922
01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:23,210
That was seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

923
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,611
Would you like to read the wording to the paper?

924
01:15:26,712 --> 01:15:27,212
Clerk Urtubis.

For some reason, I lost the video.

1014
01:19:41,797 --> 01:19:44,339
So yes, my name is Mei-Hui Hu.

1015
01:19:44,959 --> 01:19:47,301
My client's here, Ron Yang.

1016
01:19:47,421 --> 01:19:50,463
He's also participating in this video conference.

1017
01:19:51,744 --> 01:19:55,886
This is a petition by the corporation, Rainbow Rain Corporation.

1018
01:19:56,927 --> 01:20:00,532
corporation doing business as Rose's Sushi Bar.

1019
01:20:01,212 --> 01:20:08,942
And we are purchasing, this is a license, this is an application for a common vigilance license.

1020
01:20:09,449 --> 01:20:20,035
We are planning to take over the existing Rose's Chinese restaurant at the existing 315 Boston Avenue location.

1021
01:20:20,535 --> 01:20:27,138
There will be no change to the seating capacity and the operating hours remain the same as well.

1022
01:20:27,579 --> 01:20:33,142
We are actually just presenting the same services to our existing patron.

1023
01:20:33,622 --> 01:20:36,363
And Mr. Ren Ying is the first time

1024
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:41,025
business operator in Medford.

1025
01:20:41,065 --> 01:20:52,648
So he's looking forward to this opportunity to coming to Medford and contributing his experience in restaurant operating business.

1026
01:20:53,009 --> 01:20:55,989
And hopefully that this will be a right fit for him.

1027
01:20:56,009 --> 01:20:57,790
Okay.

1028
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:58,510
Thank you.

1029
01:20:59,230 --> 01:20:59,871
Thank you very much.

1030
01:21:00,831 --> 01:21:02,952
Did you say it's, is it Yang or Yang?

1031
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:04,012
Is it with a G at the end?

1032
01:21:05,526 --> 01:21:06,466

1033
01:21:06,687 --> 01:21:08,868
Y-A-N, okay, Yan, okay, thank you.

1034
01:21:09,349 --> 01:21:11,650
We see that we do have everything in order.

1035
01:21:13,372 --> 01:21:17,315
All the departments have signed off positively with this changeover, I know that.

1036
01:21:17,775 --> 01:21:21,038
But we do have a question on the time of operations.

1037
01:21:21,078 --> 01:21:23,479
What time is the previous business?

1038
01:21:24,509 --> 01:21:33,935
It might be a conflict because depending on what the hours are will depend on a separate visit to the council with hours.

1039
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:35,596
So do you have the times that they have?

1040
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:47,323
I am reading from their manu from the prior business.

1041
01:21:48,264 --> 01:21:50,205

01:21:58,454 --> 01:21:59,835
I see everything in order, Mr. President.

1047
01:21:59,855 --> 01:22:00,335

01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:10,877
I will unmute him right now.

1080
01:23:12,394 --> 01:23:15,777
It looks like we have Francis Carino as his hand up.

1081
01:23:15,797 --> 01:23:18,799
No, actually, I'm sorry.

1082

My name is John DePinto.

I'm representing the sons of Italy tonight.

1084
01:23:24,504 --> 01:23:25,765
I don't know how to do this stuff.

1085
01:23:25,805 --> 01:23:26,606
I'm on my sister's Zoom.

1086
01:23:28,007 --> 01:23:29,168
You're doing a great job.

1087
01:23:29,228 --> 01:23:34,732
Could you just give us a brief overview of what you're asking us for approval to?

1088
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:35,132
Yes.

1089
01:23:35,352 --> 01:23:38,234
We don't know if we're going to, but we want to be able to open.

1090
01:23:38,254 --> 01:23:43,318
Right now, we cannot open because we're sons of Italy, and we don't have any food.

1091
01:23:44,058 --> 01:23:48,321
So per the virus regs now, in order to open, you have to have food.

1092
01:23:48,762 --> 01:23:49,742
I have a menu here.

1093
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:55,987
We will be serving hot dogs, egg breakfast sandwiches, personal pizza, and hamburgers.

1094
01:23:56,507 --> 01:23:58,928
if we get the approval of the license.

1095
01:24:00,189 --> 01:24:03,791
So that we can then have food with alcohol, because right now all we have is alcohol.

1096
01:24:04,591 --> 01:24:04,832
So.

1097
01:24:05,192 --> 01:24:18,879
It's simple, I know we've done this in the past with other clubs, and I know that the sensitivity has been very good to our, in supporting our communities, both on the line and Method Ensemble.

1098
01:24:18,939 --> 01:24:21,700
I see everything in order, Mr. President.

1099
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,401
I move approval.

On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caravaglio.

1102
01:24:29,225 --> 01:24:30,405
Any questions from the council?

1103
01:24:31,745 --> 01:24:32,386
Any questions?

1104
01:24:32,726 --> 01:24:33,426
No one has a hand up.

1105
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:37,227
Okay, on that motion offered by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caravaglio.

Yes.

1111
01:24:45,589 --> 01:24:46,109
Councilor Nights?

1112
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,389
Yes.

1113
01:24:46,729 --> 01:24:47,290
Councilor Marks?

1114
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:47,810
Yes.

1115
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,670
Councilor Morrell?

1116
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:49,050
Yes.

1117
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:50,190
Councilor Scarpelli?

1118
01:24:50,871 --> 01:24:51,091
Yes.

1119
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:52,011
President Felken?

1120
01:24:53,652 --> 01:24:56,755
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1121

Thank you, congratulations, good luck.

1122
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:04,981
I'll run the suspension, council at eight.

1123
01:25:05,001 --> 01:25:10,246
26.639, no. 643.

1124
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:27,979
It's a long agenda, there's a lot of pages.

1125
01:25:38,157 --> 01:25:42,219
Notice of public hearing, 20-639, City of Medford.

1126

That's page four.

1131

That's okay.

1132
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,351
I went to the middle of page five.

1133

A link to this hearing will be posted no later than Friday, December 4th, 2020.

1136

1145
01:27:13,443 --> 01:27:18,347
Adam Hurnaby, city clerk, advertised in the Medford transcript November 26th, 2020 and December 3rd, 2020.

1146
01:27:18,467 --> 01:27:19,607
And we met earlier tonight.

1147
01:27:24,843 --> 01:27:29,748
in our Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss the tax rate.

1148
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:33,611
And we have our chief assessor with us tonight, Ellen Burdell.

1149
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:41,037
And Ellen, if you would like to... I'm trying to unmute you right now, Ellen.

1150
01:27:45,161 --> 01:27:46,442
There we go.

1151
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:47,723
Thank you.

1152
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:51,152
Good evening, councilors, President Falco.

1153
01:27:52,052 --> 01:27:55,254
If I may, really quick.

1154
01:27:55,334 --> 01:27:55,515
Yes.

1155
01:27:56,035 --> 01:27:58,617
So I kept doing administrative thing, something first.

1156
01:27:58,637 --> 01:28:07,002
So at this point I would open this hearing in favor of those, those in favor of the petition.

1157
01:28:08,503 --> 01:28:09,724
Ellen, would you like to speak on this?

1158
01:28:11,345 --> 01:28:13,006
Certainly, tonight's,

1159
01:28:13,843 --> 01:28:21,777
hearing is a requirement of mass general law that the city council determine the tax policy for

1160
01:28:23,681 --> 01:28:33,666
the city of Medford by either keeping a single tax rate or doing a split tax rate, splitting between residential, commercial, industrial, personal property.

1161
01:28:34,306 --> 01:28:45,052
In addition, you also need to vote whether or not to adopt a residential exemption and whether or not to adopt a small commercial exemption, as well as an open space exemption.

1162
01:28:47,350 --> 01:28:48,071
Thank you very much.

1163
01:28:49,093 --> 01:28:50,675
So you're speaking in favor of the paper?

1164
01:28:51,416 --> 01:28:51,917
That's correct.

1165
01:28:52,037 --> 01:28:52,478
Thank you.

1166
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,743
Is there anyone else that would like to speak in favor of the paper?

1167
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,002
Will Nevar, let's see.

1168
01:29:06,022 --> 01:29:06,502
Mr. President.

1169
01:29:06,823 --> 01:29:08,084
Can we have your name and address for the record?

1170
01:29:08,104 --> 01:29:08,724
If I may Mr. President.

1171
01:29:08,784 --> 01:29:09,785
Actually Will, one minute please.

1172
01:29:09,825 --> 01:29:10,326
Councilor Knight.

1173
01:29:10,486 --> 01:29:20,594
I think it might make sense for us to outline what votes we took in the subcommittee meeting earlier in the evening so that the people understand what it is that they are either opposed or against.

1174
01:29:21,015 --> 01:29:24,858
Right now it's, are you opposed to a paper that would determine a residential factor?

1175
01:29:27,779 --> 01:29:32,741
I don't think that that's really a very indicative of what exactly on the table.

1176
01:29:32,781 --> 01:29:44,966
I think it might be better off set if you know, we had a little breakdown as to what each of these four items meant and what the council voted on in the subcommittee meeting so that we could move forward in that regard.

1177
01:29:44,986 --> 01:29:46,667
Okay.

1178
01:29:46,767 --> 01:29:48,187
Ellen, do you want to speak to those points?

1179
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:50,428
Certainly.

1180
01:29:51,309 --> 01:29:54,110
Again, I,

1181
01:29:56,123 --> 01:29:57,724
I'm sorry, I'm just going back through.

1182
01:29:59,545 --> 01:30:04,948
So to speak to the first point of a- I may.

1183
01:30:05,569 --> 01:30:12,193
I think, I mean, ultimately the council voted in subcommittee to determine that we would adopt the lowest residential factor, right?

1184
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:21,238
So the issue before us is whether or not we want to, people are in favor of us adopting the lowest residential factor by having a single tax rate, right?

1185
01:30:22,013 --> 01:30:24,235
And I mean, I think that's as simple as the explanation goes.

1186
01:30:24,275 --> 01:30:30,260
I know when we get into the residential exemption and the small commercial exemption, the explanation might be a little bit further than that.

1187
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,742
But a brief synopsis, I think, would be warranted.

1188
01:30:32,862 --> 01:30:35,564
We don't need to get into the law books on it.

1189
01:30:36,925 --> 01:30:37,045
OK.

1190
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:39,407
I'd be like to give a brief synopsis on each of those points.

1191
01:30:40,828 --> 01:30:43,270
So maybe we go through the votes that we took, the council voted to do this.

1192
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:43,951
That's fine.

1193
01:30:43,971 --> 01:30:45,272
And then Ellen can explain what that means.

1194
01:30:45,292 --> 01:30:45,332
OK.

1195
01:30:53,231 --> 01:31:09,799
I can very quickly and briefly say, city council selecting the minimum residential factor of the 91.2072 will provide a split to the maximum, providing the best benefit for the residential properties in Medford.

1196
01:31:09,819 --> 01:31:14,101
Okay.

1197
01:31:14,141 --> 01:31:15,061
Councilor Knight, is that good?

1198
01:31:15,801 --> 01:31:16,622
Sounds good to me, Mr. President.

1199
01:31:16,642 --> 01:31:17,662
Okay, thank you very much.

1200
01:31:17,682 --> 01:31:20,884
Next point, to select an open space discount,

1201
01:31:21,993 --> 01:31:22,693
Do you want to talk to that?

1202
01:31:23,654 --> 01:31:24,034
Certainly.

1203
01:31:24,054 --> 01:31:27,476
There's basically a new point.

1204
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:31,398
There is no properties classified as open space in the city of Medford.

1205
01:31:31,918 --> 01:31:35,880
So there's no point for the city to adopt an open space exemption.

1206
01:31:37,621 --> 01:31:38,001
Thank you.

1207
01:31:38,921 --> 01:31:40,482
Next point is a residential exemption.

1208
01:31:42,042 --> 01:31:51,307
So the residential exemption is a shift within the residential class from the higher value properties to the lower value properties.

1209
01:31:52,508 --> 01:32:01,293
The shift occurs within that residential class by giving any owner occupied property, regardless of their value, an exemption.

1210
01:32:02,073 --> 01:32:04,814
but it shifts, it increases the tax rate.

1211
01:32:05,374 --> 01:32:07,694
Therefore, there becomes a break-even point.

1212
01:32:08,355 --> 01:32:14,116
And the break-even point I calculated for fiscal 21 would be any property valued over $727,400.

1213
01:32:14,536 --> 01:32:24,558
So you are allowed to do a residential shift within, an exemption within the shift, within that category.

1214
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:25,499
However,

1215
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:32,264
The big caveats to that is it requires an annual application.

1216
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:37,128
We have not, the city council has not approved this in the past.

1217
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:45,715
It's something that we should be looking at in the springtime so that residents can apply prior to the generation of a third quarter tax bill.

1218
01:32:47,557 --> 01:32:47,697
And

1219
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:56,196
I'm not sure I can clarify that more if that would help city council.

1220
01:32:56,476 --> 01:33:00,479
I do believe it was not recommended by the administration to adopt such at this point in time.

1221
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:01,900
That's correct.

1222
01:33:02,101 --> 01:33:03,021
It is not recommended.

1223
01:33:03,262 --> 01:33:04,683
Point of information, Councilor Scott-Belle.

1224
01:33:04,703 --> 01:33:15,371
I know it's something we did say we will visit in March with Ellen and this administration, this council, to see if it's something as we move forward with the numbers increasing.

1225
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:17,373
So I wanted to add that, Mr. President.

1226
01:33:17,393 --> 01:33:17,453
Yes.

1227
01:33:17,473 --> 01:33:18,614
Thank you, Councilor Scott-Belle.

1228
01:33:20,102 --> 01:33:26,124
And Ellen, thank you for that, your comments on the residential exemption.

1229
01:33:26,544 --> 01:33:29,525
Did you want to speak to this small commercial exemption?

1230
01:33:30,506 --> 01:33:40,629
So the small commercial exemption provides an exemption for commercial value properties under a million dollars with 10 employees or less.

1231
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:47,492
When I reviewed the database, we had 241 properties that are under the million dollars in the commercial class.

1232
01:33:48,733 --> 01:34:00,223
the benefit of that doesn't typically help the small business owner, because the small business owner that occupies that space typically isn't the owner of the property.

1233
01:34:00,623 --> 01:34:02,024
They're just the owner of the business.

1234
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:07,308
So again, not many communities in Massachusetts offer this.

1235
01:34:07,929 --> 01:34:16,156
A city council was very, very generous with adopting a small personal property exemption earlier this year, and that assisted small business owners.

1236
01:34:16,912 --> 01:34:24,938
So at this point in time, again, a small commercial exemption, it would probably not be the best time to do this.

1237
01:34:24,958 --> 01:34:26,899
Okay.

1238
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:28,641
Thank you very much.

1239
01:34:28,661 --> 01:34:32,343
Okay.

1240
01:34:34,885 --> 01:34:35,726
So let's see, Will.

1241
01:34:36,146 --> 01:34:37,747
Will Nevaeh, thank you for waiting patiently.

1242
01:34:37,947 --> 01:34:39,388
You wanted to speak in favor of this?

1243
01:34:43,071 --> 01:34:43,171
Will?

1244
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:46,647
Yes, sorry about that.

1245
01:34:46,707 --> 01:34:51,091
I want to thank Adam Knight for giving me a chance to hear that explanation.

1246
01:34:51,892 --> 01:34:52,653
That was helpful.

1247
01:34:54,434 --> 01:34:56,797
William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1248
01:34:58,988 --> 01:35:01,812
And the residential factor, what I want to say is this.

1249
01:35:01,832 --> 01:35:06,437
In the past few years, Medford has adopted the lowest residential factor available.

1250
01:35:06,477 --> 01:35:08,099
It sounds like you're going to do that again this time.

1251
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:14,367
Such a policy has the pro that it reduces the tax burden on residential property owners.

1252
01:35:15,288 --> 01:35:18,650
but has the con that it increases the burden on commercial development.

1253
01:35:19,151 --> 01:35:26,496
I think if we're worried about lack of commercial development, then we need to look into ways to reduce the tax burden when we do commercial development.

1254
01:35:27,056 --> 01:35:30,299
I'm of course not suggesting you put the residential factor at one today.

1255
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:36,163
That'd clearly be insane because you've got pandemic and that'd be a tax hike for residential owners.

1256
01:35:36,723 --> 01:35:45,051
But ultimately, this desire for high commercial growth and high commercial taxes is a contradiction that needs to be resolved.

1257
01:35:45,751 --> 01:35:49,655
It's a tough political and technical question that needs answering.

1258
01:35:51,517 --> 01:35:53,258
And the owner-occupied exemption

1259
01:35:55,055 --> 01:35:57,396
It sounds like you're going to keep that at zero.

1260
01:35:57,956 --> 01:35:59,856
And I think that is good policy.

1261
01:36:00,336 --> 01:36:09,278
Because an owner-occupied exemption will encourage people who plan to live in a house to offer more money for it.

1262
01:36:09,758 --> 01:36:15,680
So the benefit goes to the incumbent owners who will sell for higher prices rather than those buying.

1263
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:24,683
It'll also increase rental housing costs because renters will have to pay owners more money to dissuade owners selling the apartment to owner occupiers.

1264
01:36:24,703 --> 01:36:29,685
In other words, that'd be a pro-condo conversion measure.

1265
01:36:30,005 --> 01:36:31,926
It would encourage condo conversions, I think.

1266
01:36:32,906 --> 01:36:54,545
The latter aspect raises clear equity concerns because more vulnerable populations tend to rent, and if we sort of push them into buying with this policy, that will, vulnerable populations tend to pay higher interest rates on their mortgages due to, you know, if you make less money, you pay a higher interest rate, and also there's discrimination concerns, et cetera.

1267
01:36:54,946 --> 01:36:58,629
I think it's important we stick with not doing the residential exemption.

1268
01:36:59,249 --> 01:36:59,550
Thank you.

1269
01:37:00,475 --> 01:37:00,995
Thank you, Will.

1270
01:37:01,476 --> 01:37:06,880
Is there anybody else that would like to speak in favor, in favor of the proposal?

1271
01:37:06,900 --> 01:37:17,989
Nope.

1272
01:37:18,069 --> 01:37:18,249
Yeah.

1273
01:37:25,278 --> 01:37:27,380
Okay, I believe this is Andrew Castagnetti.

1274
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:29,041
Andrew, we're trying to unmute you right now.

1275
01:37:29,221 --> 01:37:29,862
Oh, there you go.

1276
01:37:29,902 --> 01:37:31,403
Andrew, name and address for the record, please.

1277
01:37:32,884 --> 01:37:34,065
Good evening, councilors.

1278
01:37:35,726 --> 01:37:36,627
Can you hear me, please?

1279
01:37:36,947 --> 01:37:37,808
Yes, we can hear you.

1280
01:37:38,808 --> 01:37:39,109
Great.

1281
01:37:39,909 --> 01:37:42,171
I'm Andrew Castagnetti, Method, Massachusetts.

1282
01:37:42,251 --> 01:37:47,896
It's nice to see you all back in the city hall chambers.

1283
01:37:48,256 --> 01:37:53,140
Not in O'Heiden, but when can the taxpayers come attend in person, sir?

1284
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:54,040
You know?

1285
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:54,721
We're trying.

1286
01:37:56,497 --> 01:37:57,457
Got to get through the COVID.

1287
01:37:58,438 --> 01:37:58,838
Thank you.

1288
01:37:59,478 --> 01:38:01,680
Anyways, welcome back to the new admiral.

1289
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,601
Thank you for your attention.

1290
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:05,562
I'll be very brief.

1291
01:38:06,622 --> 01:38:15,266
I'm here for the 10th year to ask you and the mayor to lower our real estate tax bills for own occupied homeowners.

1292
01:38:15,947 --> 01:38:19,068
It's not a hard thing to do, but with the people.

1293
01:38:19,849 --> 01:38:22,490
Simply adopt mass general law,

1294
01:38:23,098 --> 01:38:28,823
Chapter 59, Section 5C, at the full 35% exemption.

1295
01:38:30,244 --> 01:38:48,540
This act will lower the average owner-occupied real estate tax bill by $2,000 yearly in O2-155, as it is being done in Chelsea, Everett, Malvern, Cambridge, and even in all of Boston.

1296
01:38:49,621 --> 01:38:51,082
So why not here?

1297
01:38:52,812 --> 01:39:18,377
This Massachusetts state law has been applied for over 28 years times an average of, let's say $1,000 a year equals over $28,000 in total loss savings and all the charge by this city's against the average owner occupied homeowner, if they live in their home.

1298
01:39:20,718 --> 01:39:21,558
So why not here?

1299
01:39:22,525 --> 01:39:49,322
Furthermore, the city will still receive the full total real estate tax levy that the city demands because the law states that our tax savings is simply shifted and added to all the absentee residential apartment building owners from one unit to 350 unit buildings.

1300
01:39:50,623 --> 01:39:51,984
It is a commercial

1301
01:39:52,482 --> 01:39:53,782
business enterprise.

1302
01:39:55,303 --> 01:40:01,505
Furthermore, these owners mostly don't live or vote in our city.

1303
01:40:03,385 --> 01:40:04,146
Imagine this.

1304
01:40:06,006 --> 01:40:19,050
Even our Massachusetts state politicians had a touch of heart to relieve some of our real estate taxpayers when they copied California's Proposition 13 law.

1305
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:19,110
So,

1306
01:40:22,065 --> 01:40:22,785
Why not here?

1307
01:40:22,805 --> 01:40:34,428
Because after all, we own occupied homeowners have a vested interest and take pride in improving our city, I think.

1308
01:40:36,308 --> 01:40:48,431
Also, this would help renters to become first time home buyers in Medford with lower real estate tax bills if they live in the home.

1309
01:40:50,032 --> 01:40:51,552
So please, I ask again,

1310
01:40:52,340 --> 01:41:09,145
Why not here stop the discrimination and help us adopt the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption under state of Massachusetts law for method homeowners only if they actually live in their house.

1311
01:41:09,465 --> 01:41:13,606
Of course, it is 28 years long overdue.

1312
01:41:14,466 --> 01:41:15,406
Thank you for listening.

1313
01:41:16,667 --> 01:41:17,787
Thank you, Mr. Cassinetti.

1314
01:41:19,187 --> 01:41:21,288
Would anyone else like to speak in favor?

1315
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:31,554
Seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1316
01:41:32,655 --> 01:41:35,317
Would anyone like to speak in opposition?

1317
01:41:37,118 --> 01:41:39,600
Would anyone like to speak in opposition of the petition?

1318
01:41:39,620 --> 01:41:43,743
Okay.

1319
01:41:45,004 --> 01:41:47,645
Seeing and hearing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1320
01:41:50,788 --> 01:41:51,928
Councilors have any questions?

1321
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:54,210
Councilor Knight.

1322
01:41:54,491 --> 01:41:58,778
Motion to adopt the lowest residential factor to be used for FY 2021, Mr. President.

1323
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:04,186
On that motion, by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

1324
01:42:04,347 --> 01:42:04,627
Second.

1325
01:42:04,968 --> 01:42:05,529
Mr. President?

1326
01:42:06,009 --> 01:42:06,951
Councilor Scarpelli?

1327
01:42:07,512 --> 01:42:08,093
Councilor Marks?

1328
01:42:09,049 --> 01:42:18,880
Thank you, Mr. President, and I appreciate the comments by Mr. Navar that regarding the residential factor.

1329
01:42:19,761 --> 01:42:24,506
And some of what he mentioned, if not all, is completely on track.

1330
01:42:25,247 --> 01:42:34,209
that we heard tonight from the city assessor that Method is a desirable community because we have such a low residential tax rate.

1331
01:42:34,849 --> 01:42:42,931
And therefore, people want to come into the community and buy property because we have such a great low tax rate.

1332
01:42:43,511 --> 01:42:54,913
And on the flip side, Mr. President, commercial business may not see fit to come to our community because of the extremely aggressive and high tax rate.

1333
01:42:55,814 --> 01:43:15,390
And when we do the split rate, which we've been doing for years, we've always shifted, and I voted for it, we've always shifted the burden from the residents to commercial, saying, well, they're a commercial business and they should pay more in the community.

1334
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:19,793
And I agree with that, Mr. President, but I think you get it to a point where

1335
01:43:20,974 --> 01:43:25,457
The burden on the commercial, Mr. President, is having an impact on the community.

1336
01:43:26,118 --> 01:43:37,446
And when you see the percent of property in our community by value by class, almost 90% of the percent of levy

1337
01:43:39,527 --> 01:43:46,112
that we derive from our income is for residential property, 90%.

1338
01:43:47,233 --> 01:43:49,514
And then the commercial industrial make up 8.72%.

1339
01:43:50,155 --> 01:44:03,965
So you can see over the years, the shift, we're losing a lot of the commercial base, which we rely on now because they pay a much higher tax rate and we're gaining more residential, which pays a lower.

1340
01:44:04,325 --> 01:44:14,313
And at some point, we as a community are going to make a tough decision and say we don't have enough of this commercial that we've been shifting the burden to, to support our budget.

1341
01:44:15,113 --> 01:44:20,858
And I think that's going to be the question, Mr. President, that we're going to have to answer to eventually.

1342
01:44:21,298 --> 01:44:25,099
And I think it's creeping around sooner than we expect, Mr. President.

1343
01:44:26,139 --> 01:44:32,020
The numbers, if you look at the single tax rate, which we haven't supported since I've been on the council.

1344
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:41,842
If you look at the single tax rate, so that would be one tax rate for both commercial and residential, an average single family would pay $6,326.

1345
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:48,761
And the average commercial business would pay $14,707.

1346
01:44:50,161 --> 01:44:54,022
So that's with one tax rate for both sides.

1347
01:44:54,722 --> 01:45:04,284
Then you look at it, Mr. President, and if you were going to do a split rate, which we currently do, at 115%, the average single family would pay $6,215 and the average commercial would pay $6,915.

1348
01:45:11,068 --> 01:45:16,849
Then if you fast forward that into what we currently do is a split rate with 175% shift.

1349
01:45:16,869 --> 01:45:18,849
The average single family pays 5,768, so you can see it's decreased.

1350
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:20,850
And the average commercial pays 25,737.

1351
01:45:20,930 --> 01:45:23,930
So they went with the single tax rate from 14,000 for commercial up to 25,000.

1352
01:45:37,295 --> 01:45:43,140
And then if you split the rate at 115%, they went from 16,000 to 25,000.

1353
01:45:43,721 --> 01:45:47,204
Those are huge jumps, Mr. President.

1354
01:45:47,664 --> 01:45:58,234
And if you look at, if we were to reverse this a little bit and look at shifting the burden to residential, the average single family at 175, at the single family rate,

1355
01:46:03,428 --> 01:46:07,329
The single rate would pay $6,000, and at the split rate would pay $6,215.

1356
01:46:07,569 --> 01:46:20,394
The difference, really, if we sat down and started going through this, because you're shifting it over so many different properties, it's not as big as the commercial side.

1357
01:46:21,014 --> 01:46:30,638
And I know it's not a popular thing to say, but if we're really serious about keeping commercial in this city, Mr. President, and expanding the commercial tax base,

1358
01:46:31,838 --> 01:46:33,840
I think we have to take a look at it at some point.

1359
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:39,106
And sometimes, you know, officials have to stand up and take tough votes, Mr. President.

1360
01:46:39,486 --> 01:46:41,228
But I think it's something we have to look at.

1361
01:46:41,829 --> 01:46:48,756
And, you know, it's probably not going to be this time, but I think next year I would request, Mr. President,

1362
01:46:49,256 --> 01:46:54,997
that we have meetings a month or two prior to the budget meeting.

1363
01:46:55,457 --> 01:46:57,878
I'm sorry, the tax vote meeting.

1364
01:46:58,298 --> 01:47:00,599
So we could start looking at the residential factor.

1365
01:47:00,939 --> 01:47:09,721
So we could start looking at the residential exemption that has been discussed about by area residents, Mr. President.

1366
01:47:10,081 --> 01:47:18,143
And give us enough lead time to make some informed decisions rather than tonight, which most of us, to be quite honest with you,

1367
01:47:20,604 --> 01:47:27,431
I hate to say it, our hands are tied, because this is based on the budget that we put forward and it is what it is.

1368
01:47:28,452 --> 01:47:40,685
So I would ask Mr. President, under the leadership of yourself or whoever, as the Council of Vice President, Kaviel's the next president, that we have meetings well in advance.

1369
01:47:41,185 --> 01:47:45,648
to when we set the tax rate so we can discuss some of the issues, Mr. President.

1370
01:47:46,008 --> 01:47:50,350
As we heard tonight, I always thought that the tax rate was due at the end of January.

1371
01:47:50,710 --> 01:47:57,854
We heard that you could vote on it to have it done at the end of June, which gives you another six months of additional

1372
01:47:59,335 --> 01:48:04,341
growth that you could use in a time of recession like we're seeing now.

1373
01:48:04,742 --> 01:48:09,247
That's six months that could add some new growth onto it and give us some additional revenue.

1374
01:48:09,807 --> 01:48:13,872
And that's the lead time I think we need as a council to start discussing this.

1375
01:48:15,974 --> 01:48:34,606
I'm prepared to vote on this tonight, Mr. President, but I think, you know, we have to take a long, hard look at how we average out the property in our community and see if it makes sense to continue to shift the way we're shifting if we're really serious about keeping a commercial base in this community.

1376
01:48:34,706 --> 01:48:35,047
Thank you.

1377
01:48:35,067 --> 01:48:36,407
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1378
01:48:36,568 --> 01:48:37,308
Councilor Peers.

1379
01:48:38,169 --> 01:48:39,129
Thank you, Mr. President.

1380
01:48:39,189 --> 01:48:44,953
And thank you to Councilor Marks, Mr. Navarro, and to all my colleagues, you know,

1381
01:48:45,914 --> 01:48:53,517
What we're talking about here are different ways of adjusting the distribution of the taxes that we currently assess on the community.

1382
01:48:54,257 --> 01:49:02,940
We've done the same thing for a long time, and we've seen some negative externalities on the commercial side, especially, that I think a lot of people don't like.

1383
01:49:03,761 --> 01:49:05,221
So I think it is time to reassess.

1384
01:49:05,881 --> 01:49:12,484
Another piece of this, though, is the amount that we have to spend as a city on city services, which, as we all know,

1385
01:49:13,455 --> 01:49:33,209
too low that every department is understaffed our schools and every city department doesn't have the resources it needs and I think in addition to exploring the residential factor and also I think the residential exemption there may be a combination of these tools with the distribution and the tools at our disposals to increase revenue that would allow us to

1386
01:49:34,638 --> 01:49:54,731
have a just distribution for the people of Medford, commercial and residential both, property owners, as well as raising the revenue that we need, as I mentioned, and I essentially mentioned this during our budget conversation in June, to increase the revenue that we have for city services so that we can provide to the people of Medford the services that they deserve.

1387
01:49:55,291 --> 01:49:59,814
And I think that's a conversation that's long overdue, so I hope that that

1388
01:50:00,939 --> 01:50:07,698
As part of the conversations around the tax rate and the budget, we can have an honest conversation about the unmet needs of

1389
01:50:08,223 --> 01:50:13,545
our community when it comes to city services, as well as the distribution of the tax assessment.

1390
01:50:13,965 --> 01:50:14,846
Thank you, Mr. President.

1391
01:50:15,006 --> 01:50:16,266
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

1392
01:50:16,366 --> 01:50:32,413
And we discussed in our committee the whole earlier tonight about having a community hall meeting in March to kind of kick that off and talk about different options and to talk about the residential exemption and other issues.

1393
01:50:32,513 --> 01:50:36,074
So in March, we'll be talking more about those topics.

1394
01:50:36,455 --> 01:50:36,935
Just to let you know.

1395
01:50:37,995 --> 01:50:49,979
Okay, so there was a motion on the floor, and that motion was offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, and the motion was, can you read that again, Councilor, Clerk Artavis?

1396
01:50:52,620 --> 01:50:58,102
The motion was to adopt the lowest residential factor possible to be used in 2021, which is 91.2072, I believe.

1397
01:50:58,122 --> 01:50:59,343
That is correct.

1398
01:51:00,223 --> 01:51:01,203
Ellen, that's correct, right?

1399
01:51:08,872 --> 01:51:09,532
Thumbs up, okay.

1400
01:51:12,094 --> 01:51:12,294
Yes.

1401
01:51:12,634 --> 01:51:13,275
Okay, perfect.

1402
01:51:13,635 --> 01:51:15,396
On that motion, Clerk Bernal, please call the roll.

1403
01:51:16,277 --> 01:51:16,857

1437
01:52:20,177 --> 01:52:20,738
Councilor Morrell.

1438
01:52:21,613 --> 01:52:22,394
Thank you Mr. President.

1439
01:52:22,634 --> 01:52:28,502
Before we take the vote on the owner occupied exemption, I do want to just share that I very much support this.

1440
01:52:28,622 --> 01:52:30,664
I do think it's something that Medford very much needs.

1441
01:52:31,425 --> 01:52:36,372
Based on the presentation we had earlier tonight in the Committee of the Whole, as far as Ellen recommending that

1442
01:52:36,912 --> 01:52:43,515
If Medford were to adopt this, it needs to be done earlier in the year so residents can actually benefit from this and apply for this.

1443
01:52:44,055 --> 01:52:49,857
So I'm going to be voting no tonight, but I do very much believe that Medford would benefit from an owner-occupied exemption.

1444
01:52:49,897 --> 01:52:56,380
I look forward to a future presentation from Ellen on this more in depth and more conversation around this.

1445
01:52:56,780 --> 01:52:57,720
Thank you.

1446
01:52:59,281 --> 01:53:00,221
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1447
01:53:06,084 --> 01:53:07,765
Motion to adopt a residential exemption.

1448
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:14,709
And the motion of Councilor Behr is to adopt, to select a, I'm sorry, adopt a residential exemption.

1449
01:53:14,789 --> 01:53:15,350
Seconded by.

1450
01:53:18,019 --> 01:53:18,559
Seconded by?

1451
01:53:18,980 --> 01:53:19,260
Second.

1452
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:20,681
Councilor Scarpelli.

1453
01:53:20,701 --> 01:53:22,162
Mr. President, before you call the roll.

1454
01:53:22,442 --> 01:53:24,923
Yes, sorry, Councilor Marks.

1455
01:53:25,584 --> 01:53:26,545
Thank you, Mr. President.

1456
01:53:26,845 --> 01:53:38,652
I just wanted to clarify that last year when we discussed the residential exemption, and I know Mr. Castaneda has been a stalwart regarding this.

1457
01:53:39,393 --> 01:53:44,096
He says 10 years, I think he's been talking about this for 20 years, or at least it seems 20 years.

1458
01:53:45,860 --> 01:53:46,921
So long, Mr. President.

1459
01:53:48,222 --> 01:54:07,522
Last year when we discussed it, I think Councilor Knight brought up the fact that the numbers that we received that were the break even point for assessments over, I think it was 640,000 Councilor Knight mentioned, was a little over 2,000 households that were owner occupied, that lived in their home.

1460
01:54:08,022 --> 01:54:18,244
If we voted for residential exemption, because their property was assessed at over a certain amount of money, which was the break even point, they would still have to pay a higher tax rate.

1461
01:54:18,984 --> 01:54:23,485
And we were told there were about 2,000 properties in the community, that was last year.

1462
01:54:23,825 --> 01:54:35,627
And that's a number I've been monitoring over the years, because I think we as a council, I won't speak for anyone else, said if the numbers were falling, meaning that there were less and less people that fell in this range.

1463
01:54:36,507 --> 01:54:46,177
that were the exception to the rule that we may see favorable to vote on this and provide a property tax, a residential exemption.

1464
01:54:46,698 --> 01:54:56,488
We heard tonight, Mr. President, from the city assessor that they're saying now there's over 4,000 properties that are above the break even point, Mr. President.

1465
01:54:57,148 --> 01:55:05,773
And in addition, out of the 4,000, 1,300 properties of people that are over the age of 60, which are seniors in our community.

1466
01:55:06,933 --> 01:55:13,137
So these numbers are very staggering, Mr. President, and there may have been a discrepancy over the years.

1467
01:55:13,877 --> 01:55:21,865
As we heard from the city's assessor, and I won't put words in her mouth, that they may have not been counting every type of property.

1468
01:55:22,245 --> 01:55:30,613
So they may have been just looking at single families and not condos or two families or multi-families.

1469
01:55:31,773 --> 01:55:40,936
So this number, in my opinion, is a little alarming that there's so many people that would fall out of the range of residential exemption.

1470
01:55:41,576 --> 01:55:48,219
And I'm looking forward to discussions possibly in March regarding

1471
01:55:49,819 --> 01:55:53,641
actually taking a closer look at this and seeing if these are the true numbers.

1472
01:55:54,042 --> 01:56:00,565
I think the city assessor made a commitment that she would revisit these numbers to see if they're true and accurate.

1473
01:56:01,006 --> 01:56:09,290
But I just want Mr. Castanetti and others to know that we do monitor this, we do keep an eye on this, and the numbers have fluctuated.

1474
01:56:09,711 --> 01:56:12,532
And in this case, they fluctuated in a way that

1475
01:56:14,854 --> 01:56:16,735
I couldn't support at this particular point.

1476
01:56:16,955 --> 01:56:20,638
There's just too many people, Mr. President, that would be impacted by this.

1477
01:56:21,739 --> 01:56:26,043
And I think the good outweighs the bad in this, Mr. President.

1478
01:56:26,543 --> 01:56:27,604
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1479
01:56:27,724 --> 01:56:28,425
Councilor Behrs?

1480
01:56:28,745 --> 01:56:32,969
I just also want to add that it would be great to get figures.

1481
01:56:33,149 --> 01:56:34,810
We have kind of estimates right now.

1482
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:39,694
I think if we had that historical data, it would present a much clearer picture, as Councilor Marks indicated.

1483
01:56:40,435 --> 01:56:42,116
But the flip side is that there are as many as 11,000

1484
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:44,851
properties that could benefit.

1485
01:56:45,672 --> 01:56:47,713
So it's definitely a difficult decision.

1486
01:56:47,733 --> 01:56:49,594
That's our job is to make difficult decisions.

1487
01:56:49,654 --> 01:56:53,857
But I think it's important that we talk about costs and benefits as well.

1488
01:56:54,918 --> 01:56:57,800
Probably many seniors who are in that 11,000.

1489
01:56:58,841 --> 01:57:04,005
So we really need to have the facts in front of us to make an informed decision on the residential exemption.

1490
01:57:04,245 --> 01:57:04,565
Thank you.

1491
01:57:05,005 --> 01:57:05,346
Thank you.

1492
01:57:07,698 --> 01:57:08,178
Councilor Nye.

1493
01:57:08,618 --> 01:57:18,763
And just on Councilor Marks' point, Mr. President, looking at the math and the numbers that were put before us this evening, that 4,000 households looks like it represents about almost a quarter of the community.

1494
01:57:20,584 --> 01:57:25,126
So that would be one in four paying more, even though they're owner-occupied.

1495
01:57:25,586 --> 01:57:27,087
And I think that's very important to point out.

1496
01:57:27,147 --> 01:57:30,228
So, you know, I think that, you know, garbage in, garbage out, right?

1497
01:57:30,348 --> 01:57:31,809
You can only make good decisions with good data.

1498
01:57:32,029 --> 01:57:33,330
And that's what we need to focus on.

1499
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:34,090
You are correct.

1500
01:57:35,373 --> 01:57:40,598
So on the motion of Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly, Clerk Carter please call the roll.

1501
01:57:42,901 --> 01:57:43,401
Councilor Behrs.

02:00:54,765 --> 02:00:56,626
If I could just have your name and address for the record.

1567
02:00:56,786 --> 02:01:01,488
And if you could give us a brief statement as to why you are in favor of the petition.

1568
02:01:02,548 --> 02:01:02,768
Sure.

1569
02:01:03,148 --> 02:01:04,589
My name is Adam LaRusso.

1570
02:01:05,209 --> 02:01:08,490
I'm living at 18 Preble street in Boston.

1571
02:01:10,331 --> 02:01:12,372
So I'm the one that filed the petition.

1572
02:01:12,452 --> 02:01:14,693
I just want to thank the city council for hearing me tonight.

1573
02:01:15,956 --> 02:01:21,078
So what I'm looking to do at 507 High Street is open up a private tattoo studio.

1574
02:01:21,098 --> 02:01:31,321
I think it's important to point out that what I'm looking to do is not a typical tattoo shop, but a private, appointment-only tattoo studio.

1575
02:01:31,841 --> 02:01:36,043
And this would be to the degree that even the door would be locked.

1576
02:01:36,203 --> 02:01:38,003
Unless you have an appointment, you would come in.

1577
02:01:38,283 --> 02:01:39,884
And other than that, no public.

1578
02:01:41,606 --> 02:01:47,369
traffic, and it would be a very small scale operation.

1579
02:01:48,509 --> 02:01:55,832
And I did want to address that I know that tattoo shops typically have a certain stigma, a certain connotation.

1580
02:01:56,512 --> 02:02:04,435
And I wanted to make sure that I was available to answer any questions from anyone that might come about because of this.

1581
02:02:04,455 --> 02:02:04,675
Thank you.

1582
02:02:04,715 --> 02:02:04,895
Thank you.

1583
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:06,371
Okay, thank you very much.

1584
02:02:06,971 --> 02:02:11,433
At this point, I'd ask anyone else in favor of the petition that would like to speak.

1585
02:02:11,673 --> 02:02:14,794
Okay, we have Colin Burgoyne.

1586
02:02:16,175 --> 02:02:17,275
Can I try to unmute you?

1587
02:02:17,295 --> 02:02:19,616
Name and address for the record.

1588
02:02:21,357 --> 02:02:24,558
Colin Burgoyne at 161 George Street in Medford.

1589
02:02:25,238 --> 02:02:28,300
I'm also the owner of Colleen's Ice Cream Shop here in Medford.

1590
02:02:29,200 --> 02:02:31,701
And I just wanted to speak to Adam LaRusso.

1591
02:02:31,721 --> 02:02:33,222
He's been a personal friend of mine

1592
02:02:34,777 --> 02:02:39,081
But more than that, just really proud of the work he's done as an artist.

1593
02:02:39,601 --> 02:02:41,923
He's one of the best young artists we have in the city.

1594
02:02:43,084 --> 02:02:49,689
He has signed on to do some mural work with us, and I did commission a few pieces for ourselves.

1595
02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:54,793
And we really support him being able to open up his shop here in Medford.

1596
02:02:55,334 --> 02:03:03,320
After being in the business for so long in Cambridge and in Somerville, I think it's great that he's come back home to set up shop.

1597
02:03:05,732 --> 02:03:06,573
Colin, thank you very much.

1598
02:03:06,593 --> 02:03:09,075
Okay, those in favor.

1599
02:03:09,095 --> 02:03:11,196
We have a Reverend Wendy.

1600
02:03:12,858 --> 02:03:14,279
I'm going to try to unmute you.

1601
02:03:14,699 --> 02:03:19,203
If you could give us your name and address for the record, and if you could tell us why you're in favor of the petition.

1602
02:03:20,624 --> 02:03:23,786
Thank you, President Falco and City Council.

1603
02:03:24,567 --> 02:03:25,828
My name is Wendy Miller-Olape.

1604
02:03:27,362 --> 02:03:37,628
I am a resident at 105 Brook Street and a fellow shopkeeper, if you will, in West Medford Square.

1605
02:03:37,748 --> 02:03:41,130
So I have a brief letter that I'd like to share for the record.

1606
02:03:41,230 --> 02:03:44,272
I sent it earlier, but I was late for the deadline, so.

1607
02:03:45,012 --> 02:03:51,597
I am in support of artist Adam LaRusso's application to open a body art studio in West Medford.

1608
02:03:52,278 --> 02:04:01,165
He and the studio that he intends to open I'm sure will be a brilliant addition to our city and specifically West Medford's neighborhood business and art scene.

1609
02:04:01,645 --> 02:04:08,311
I've known Mr. LaRusso for five years and have interacted with him as pastor and one of his spiritual guides.

1610
02:04:08,971 --> 02:04:32,357
as the facilitator of a deeply inspirational art experience when his work, his paintings, were installed at our gallery, as a partner in building Beloved Community, which I've watched him do in the art scene and with other colleagues, and as a very satisfied and safely held recipient of one of his beautiful pieces of art, which is on my forearm here.

1611
02:04:33,377 --> 02:04:54,305
In addition to bringing these kinds of commitments to our city, Mr. LaRusso is a gifted, celebrated, and inspirational painter, an active member of the Boston area art community, an invested co-op studio member, and has actually achieved acclaim as one of Boston's most highly regarded and sought after artists.

1612
02:04:54,406 --> 02:04:57,347
He is considered one of the top artists in our area.

1613
02:04:58,247 --> 02:05:12,479
He and his family have been active members of the Medford community for generations and his family values that I can attest to and their investment in Medford is a grounding influence in the manner in which he invests in his clients and in his business model.

1614
02:05:12,499 --> 02:05:20,545
I'm confident knowing him as I do that his studio will be a bright spot in our city and will attract great energy to our neighborhood.

1615
02:05:21,126 --> 02:05:22,327
So thank you for your attention.

1616
02:05:22,447 --> 02:05:24,588
I highly support having him be here.

1617
02:05:25,449 --> 02:05:26,170
Thank you very much.

1618
02:05:28,576 --> 02:05:31,299
Would anyone else like to speak in favor of the petition?

1619
02:05:31,319 --> 02:05:39,327
Okay, hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1620
02:05:40,928 --> 02:05:43,711
Is there anyone in opposition of the petition that would like to speak?

1621
02:05:43,771 --> 02:05:44,672
Anyone in opposition?

1622
02:05:48,816 --> 02:05:49,317
Adam, you see anything?

1623
02:05:55,684 --> 02:05:56,004
Okay.

1624
02:05:56,825 --> 02:05:59,488
Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

1625
02:06:00,009 --> 02:06:03,753
At this point, I recognize Councilor Scarpelli.

1626
02:06:05,171 --> 02:06:09,074
Councilor Pierce.

1627
02:06:09,475 --> 02:06:10,275
Thank you, Mr. President.

1628
02:06:10,315 --> 02:06:16,100
I just wanted to thank Adam and Reverend Wendy and everyone else who spoke.

1629
02:06:16,360 --> 02:06:28,030
I just wanted to add that there were a number of letters from members of our community attesting to Mr. LaRusso's both skill and also devotion to our community.

1630
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:31,292
And I think that those testimonies speak volumes.

1631
02:06:31,372 --> 02:06:34,355
So I'm supportive of this.

1632
02:06:35,022 --> 02:06:35,703
Tonight, thank you.

1633
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:36,964
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

1634
02:06:37,004 --> 02:06:37,925
Councilor Scarapelli.

1635
02:06:39,126 --> 02:06:39,947
Thank you, Mr. President.

1636
02:06:40,268 --> 02:06:53,702
I know that I had a great discussion with Mr. LaRusso, and I too received a lot of correspondence from our residents in supporting of a very fine and respected young man.

1637
02:06:56,828 --> 02:07:03,151
In our discussion, and I know Mr. LaRusso would speak on any question that people would like to offer.

1638
02:07:03,632 --> 02:07:15,939
I know that the questions I had from people that were a little nervous about when you hear a tattoo parlor that's coming to your neighborhood, the things they fear are these frightening,

1639
02:07:17,981 --> 02:07:35,261
pictures of artwork that depict violence or sexual things in sexual nature and it really scares a community and I think that Mr. LaRusso and I had a great discussion and you know I believe he put it as his

1640
02:07:37,443 --> 02:07:45,645
It sounds like an artist studio for the body, and understanding that it's by appointment only, that the building will be unassuming.

1641
02:07:45,765 --> 02:08:00,930
I think that the biggest questions that we talked openly about being across the street from the church, there might be some negative concerns with that, but he reiterated his deep faith.

1642
02:08:02,130 --> 02:08:12,734
And his support to the church and making sure that whatever he does as a business here in Medford, that it's done with class and with respect for that neighborhood.

1643
02:08:13,394 --> 02:08:14,494
And again,

1644
02:08:16,627 --> 02:08:37,247
He hit all the buzzwords for me that you have a well-respected individual that has the total best interests of all of the neighbors and making sure that he is putting forth a classy and respected organization in this community.

1645
02:08:39,009 --> 02:08:46,832
I know that we typically do move, request to move this to a committee of the whole.

1646
02:08:46,852 --> 02:08:58,256
So we do hear from other residents in making sure that there's some concerns that if they had, they can listen to a very educated and eloquent individual.

1647
02:08:59,016 --> 02:09:17,689
can speak on behalf of his art prowess and realize that he is really, could be an important piece of not only the West Memphis community, but I think a model for other neighborhoods that are looking to bring in the body art and the tattooing industry.

1648
02:09:17,749 --> 02:09:19,251
So, thank you, Mr. President.

1649
02:09:19,271 --> 02:09:20,211
Thank you, Councilor Scarpello.

1650
02:09:20,231 --> 02:09:22,953
We have Councilor Morrell, then Vice President Scarviello.

1651
02:09:23,373 --> 02:09:23,954
Councilor Morrell.

1652
02:09:24,274 --> 02:09:24,494
you.

1653
02:09:24,554 --> 02:09:24,774
Thank you.

1654
02:09:24,794 --> 02:09:25,174
Mister President.

1655
02:09:25,214 --> 02:09:27,935
If I could through the chair, just a question for Mister LaRusso.

1656
02:09:28,695 --> 02:09:33,357
There's those big, beautiful windows on the property there previously filled with antiques.

1657
02:09:33,497 --> 02:09:39,018
But I do know your neighbors, potential neighbors at Bistro 5 take a more kind of subdued approach.

1658
02:09:39,079 --> 02:09:39,459
The windows.

1659
02:09:39,519 --> 02:09:45,340
I'm just curious what you envision for those big if you wouldn't have that space.

1660
02:09:54,690 --> 02:09:56,231
want to have anything flashy.

1661
02:09:56,792 --> 02:10:09,180
I think one of the reasons why I'm opening a private studio, as opposed to continuing to work in a very well-respected tattoo shop, is to have something that is very small, very intimate, very unassuming.

1662
02:10:10,861 --> 02:10:15,785
And so I don't even plan on really putting much artwork in them, to be honest.

1663
02:10:15,805 --> 02:10:22,129
There would be a sign with the name of the shop, but very simple, very clean,

1664
02:10:23,965 --> 02:10:24,846
And that would really be it.

1665
02:10:25,668 --> 02:10:26,469
OK, yeah, thank you.

1666
02:10:26,569 --> 02:10:35,703
I know and I know this is not what you're proposing, but I think some people's fears stem from the fact of thinking they someone's going to wander up to the window and pick out their tattoo and go inside.

1667
02:10:35,783 --> 02:10:38,708
So I appreciate you clarifying that.

1668
02:10:39,159 --> 02:10:44,023
No, of course, and I totally understand where people's hesitations come from.

1669
02:10:45,163 --> 02:10:59,393
So again, any questions, I would definitely welcome them, because I want to make sure that not only am I granted so graciously the opportunity to do business Medford, but people know that I am going to be contributing as

1670
02:11:02,950 --> 02:11:05,553
like an actual member of the community.

1671
02:11:06,895 --> 02:11:15,005
It's hard for me to speak because I tend to be pretty humble, but I actually am a very well-respected and sought-after tattoo artist.

1672
02:11:15,886 --> 02:11:17,368
I have people traveling from

1673
02:11:17,982 --> 02:11:28,071
New York to Florida to Chicago, I guess not right now because of COVID, but I tattoo members of the Patriots to members of the clergy.

1674
02:11:28,091 --> 02:11:41,323
I work with a lot of different people and I have such a great opportunity to have such a great client list that the whole point of doing this for me is to again, do something that's very small, intimate, unassuming, relaxing.

1675
02:11:41,843 --> 02:11:44,244
So people don't actually have to deal with a tattoo shop.

1676
02:11:44,704 --> 02:11:48,986
That's, you know, probably more of what you would think of like a very loud, buzzy place.

1677
02:11:49,087 --> 02:11:50,927
This would be the complete opposite.

1678
02:11:51,688 --> 02:11:55,089
Again, intimate, unassuming, small appointment only.

1679
02:11:55,109 --> 02:11:57,290
So I just want to make sure that that's clear.

1680
02:11:58,511 --> 02:11:58,731
Great.

1681
02:11:58,851 --> 02:11:59,211
Thank you.

1682
02:11:59,552 --> 02:12:00,552
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1683
02:12:00,692 --> 02:12:03,093
We have Vice President Carvillo.

1684
02:12:04,874 --> 02:12:06,015
Thank you, Mr. President.

1685
02:12:06,235 --> 02:12:10,017
And again, I'll reiterate what some of the other councilors have brought up.

1686
02:12:13,755 --> 02:12:25,362
There's a church and a school right across the street from you, so if you could keep your establishment as tasteful and tactful as possible, that's about the only thing I can request of you.

1687
02:12:27,443 --> 02:12:37,470
I'd also like to, if we can get a report on the status of the other facility in West Leavitt that we voted on last year.

1688
02:12:37,570 --> 02:12:38,370
Are they coming?

1689
02:12:38,430 --> 02:12:39,171
Are they not coming?

1690
02:12:41,699 --> 02:12:48,062
and have that, so when we do have a community hall, we'll know what the status of that studio is also.

1691
02:12:48,082 --> 02:12:51,103
So if we can make that part of the paper, Mr. President.

1692
02:12:51,203 --> 02:12:55,844
Okay, so we'll make that, we'll have to do a B paper for that, okay?

1693
02:12:56,445 --> 02:12:58,645
So on the motion of Vice President Caviello, seconded by?

1694
02:12:58,665 --> 02:13:00,786
Second.

1695
02:13:01,246 --> 02:13:02,026
Councilor Scott Fevella.

1696
02:13:02,707 --> 02:13:03,247
Councilor Marks.

1697
02:13:04,137 --> 02:13:05,097
Thank you, Mr. President.

1698
02:13:05,277 --> 02:13:10,439
And I want to thank Mr. LaRusso for expressing interest in coming to our community.

1699
02:13:11,399 --> 02:13:14,240
I just had a couple of really quick questions.

1700
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:17,241
What would his staff consist of?

1701
02:13:17,261 --> 02:13:20,161
Thank you, Councilor.

1702
02:13:20,201 --> 02:13:21,362
So it would be just me.

1703
02:13:22,162 --> 02:13:23,682
I would be the only working artist.

1704
02:13:24,503 --> 02:13:32,685
I have toyed around with the idea of possibly hiring a front desk person for a day or two during the week, more so to help with the administration.

1705
02:13:33,606 --> 02:13:39,747
So sending emails and whatnot, but that's another thing to share is that I would be the only sole artist.

1706
02:13:40,247 --> 02:13:41,448
So just me.

1707
02:13:42,888 --> 02:13:50,109
And would your establishment consist of strictly tattooing or would it be body piercing as well?

1708
02:13:51,570 --> 02:13:52,930
It would be strictly tattooing.

1709
02:13:53,830 --> 02:13:54,150
Okay.

1710
02:13:55,151 --> 02:13:56,771
And I'm sure you're familiar.

1711
02:13:56,791 --> 02:14:02,052
You said you work for a current tattoo establishment.

1712
02:14:02,858 --> 02:14:03,038
Yes.

1713
02:14:03,619 --> 02:14:24,338
So I'm sure you're aware of all the proper protocols and procedures for the placement of syringes and needles and anything else associated with your business, blood and any other bodily fluids that are associated with your particular business.

1714
02:14:26,108 --> 02:14:27,168
Yes, sir.

1715
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:31,850
Very much so as a self-proclaimed germaphobe, I am very well aware.

1716
02:14:32,110 --> 02:14:42,173
And actually, uh, I was speaking with Sophie in the health department and actually had a couple of suggestions on, uh, ways to possibly update the health code and actually be even a little bit safer.

1717
02:14:42,693 --> 02:14:51,136
Um, I pride myself in not just creating good tattoos and a good experience, but third and just as important as those things, uh, a safe experience.

1718
02:14:51,756 --> 02:14:53,597
Um, because not only is it my reputation,

1719
02:14:53,996 --> 02:14:55,397
but it's also someone's health.

1720
02:14:55,657 --> 02:14:57,798
And I take that incredibly seriously.

1721
02:14:57,818 --> 02:15:05,022
Um, and I pride myself in always watching when I'm in a tattoo space, things that could be improved upon.

1722
02:15:05,062 --> 02:15:07,484
That's something I take extremely seriously.

1723
02:15:07,504 --> 02:15:19,231
Um, and would a hundred percent continue to do so, not just maintain status quo, but always improve and stay up to date on anything that's coming out in the industry that could make people safer.

1724
02:15:19,831 --> 02:15:23,013
I can a hundred percent assure you that is very important to me.

1725
02:15:24,557 --> 02:15:28,038
And what would you anticipate your hours of operation to be in general?

1726
02:15:29,879 --> 02:15:30,619
Sure.

1727
02:15:30,819 --> 02:15:33,780
So it would probably be in the 10 a.m.

1728
02:15:33,920 --> 02:15:36,400
to 6 p.m.-ish range.

1729
02:15:36,821 --> 02:15:39,941
I'm sure that if someday I ran a little bit late, maybe 7.

1730
02:15:41,102 --> 02:15:44,823
But not really early in the morning, because it's difficult to make appointments early.

1731
02:15:44,843 --> 02:15:47,343
And I tend not to like to work late.

1732
02:15:47,423 --> 02:15:50,144
So I would assume somewhere between 10 a.m.

1733
02:15:50,464 --> 02:15:51,225
and 6 p.m.

1734
02:15:51,645 --> 02:15:52,605
with an hour, give or take.

1735
02:15:54,038 --> 02:15:55,739
Are we looking at how many days a week?

1736
02:15:57,981 --> 02:16:00,623
Most likely four, but the possibility of five.

1737
02:16:02,824 --> 02:16:03,124
Okay.

1738
02:16:03,344 --> 02:16:06,166
Currently four is what my preferred schedule is.

1739
02:16:07,327 --> 02:16:07,567
Okay.

1740
02:16:07,967 --> 02:16:20,416
And if you were to know there was another establishment that existed within a hundred yards from your establishment that does the same type of tattooing, would that discourage you from going to this location?

1741
02:16:21,628 --> 02:16:22,308
Not at all.

1742
02:16:23,229 --> 02:16:29,891
To be completely blunt, I don't really care if there's another tattoo shop.

1743
02:16:30,771 --> 02:16:41,695
Because of what I do is so specialized, and again, I may say so myself quite humbly, because I'm so sought after, I don't think it's really going to affect my business.

1744
02:16:42,532 --> 02:16:47,756
The interactions I've had with the landlords of 507 High Street have been brilliant.

1745
02:16:48,717 --> 02:16:59,125
I've been really excited to not only be working with them, but be near folks like Wendy up the street at Sanctuary and Colin who spoke earlier.

1746
02:17:00,056 --> 02:17:02,418
And so it wouldn't deter me at all.

1747
02:17:04,319 --> 02:17:12,367
I tried to do a little bit of research, and I actually have never heard of them, which is strange because I'm pretty up-to-date on local tattoo communities.

1748
02:17:12,447 --> 02:17:17,191
So I'm sure I might reach out just to introduce myself, but that would be it.

1749
02:17:17,291 --> 02:17:18,833
Just like a friendly neighbor, hello.

1750
02:17:19,627 --> 02:17:19,807
Right.

1751
02:17:20,107 --> 02:17:22,349
And I appreciate that.

1752
02:17:22,389 --> 02:17:27,313
And the reason why I bring it up is because Council Vice President Caviello brought up a very valid point.

1753
02:17:28,094 --> 02:17:37,002
We, this council, approved a tattoo parlor, probably 100 yards, 200 yards from the establishment that you're looking at.

1754
02:17:37,022 --> 02:17:40,865
And, you know, I think it's unfair that

1755
02:17:41,666 --> 02:17:45,469
that hasn't taken place yet, and most people have probably forgotten about it.

1756
02:17:46,210 --> 02:17:48,112
And here you are, a new establishment coming in.

1757
02:17:48,452 --> 02:17:55,419
So I think it's important to know what may eventually, or already has been approved, but may eventually pop up next door to you.

1758
02:17:55,799 --> 02:17:58,622
Because people make business decisions based on that.

1759
02:17:59,603 --> 02:18:04,288
A number of factors, and that could be one, proximity of other like establishments and so forth.

1760
02:18:04,868 --> 02:18:20,979
And maybe that's something we have to look at as a council when we issue a special permit that I believe, as Councilor Knight mentioned, and he'd probably know better than I, that it's good for up to a year, which sounds kind of excessive, to be quite honest with you.

1761
02:18:21,060 --> 02:18:29,986
And I think that opens up a lot of different doors when you have things hanging out there and you're not sure what may or may not go in there after approval.

1762
02:18:31,027 --> 02:18:33,968
So that's something we may want to look at as a council.

1763
02:18:34,509 --> 02:18:39,892
And my last thing is I have to admit, I am a little jealous of Reverend Wendy's tattoo.

1764
02:18:40,893 --> 02:18:49,799
And if she's willing, maybe she could show us some more of her tattoos because that was pretty impressive.

1765
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:53,021
But I wish you well.

1766
02:18:53,261 --> 02:18:55,142
And I wish you all but good luck.

1767
02:18:56,063 --> 02:18:56,743
Thank you very much.

1768
02:18:56,763 --> 02:18:57,664
I appreciate that.

1769
02:18:58,389 --> 02:19:05,094
And if I may, just to add on to a comment you made, counselor, I am 100% ready to go.

1770
02:19:06,535 --> 02:19:10,598
So obviously, I need to do a final health inspect walkthrough.

1771
02:19:10,618 --> 02:19:14,081
But other than that, I'm ready to get in there and start paying taxes.

1772
02:19:14,621 --> 02:19:19,665
So if you folks will have me, I would love to be in there as soon as possible.

1773
02:19:19,825 --> 02:19:23,968
And I'm really, really excited to be part of the Medford community.

1774
02:19:23,988 --> 02:19:26,550
I'm third generation Medfordian.

1775
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:29,341
And this is very exciting for me.

1776
02:19:29,481 --> 02:19:30,921
So thank you for hearing me.

1777
02:19:31,941 --> 02:19:32,301
Thank you.

1778
02:19:32,661 --> 02:19:33,862
We have a couple more questions.

1779
02:19:33,922 --> 02:19:35,642
Counselor Knight, then Counselor Morrell.

1780
02:19:35,702 --> 02:19:36,362
Counselor Knight.

1781
02:19:36,822 --> 02:19:38,003
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1782
02:19:38,703 --> 02:19:40,703
Mr. LaRusso, thank you for coming this evening.

1783
02:19:40,984 --> 02:19:47,525
I'd first like to start off by saying that your abilities nor is your character in question this evening.

1784
02:19:48,565 --> 02:19:54,487
I got a phone call from a dear friend of mine, Chris Murphy, raving about your character and the type of person that you are.

1785
02:19:56,068 --> 02:20:02,751
And his opinion that you'd be a great fit in Medford, and that goes a long way with me.

1786
02:20:03,431 --> 02:20:07,893
You know, personal relationships that I have with individuals in the community and their opinion mean a lot.

1787
02:20:10,237 --> 02:20:12,019
I'm certainly no prude, I have tattoos.

1788
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:15,301
Not too happy that I got them when I was a young kid, but I got to live with them.

1789
02:20:15,621 --> 02:20:16,122
They're forever.

1790
02:20:17,043 --> 02:20:30,974
And I think that you're well aware of the concern that some people in the neighborhood have and some people in the parish have relative to the location of the studio and the aesthetics that may or may not be present there upon opening.

1791
02:20:31,585 --> 02:20:40,766
And I do have a specific request, and I'm hoping to be willing to entertain it, would be that you conduct a community meeting with the neighbors and with the residents in the parish.

1792
02:20:42,954 --> 02:20:48,958
To explain to them exactly what it is you're trying to do down there, and what direction you're looking to go in.

1793
02:20:49,058 --> 02:20:52,860
I certainly have no issue with the tattoo shop in West Memphis Square.

1794
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:56,042
I voted for one just a couple weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago, Mr. President.

1795
02:20:56,763 --> 02:20:58,004
I'm no prude by any means.

1796
02:20:58,724 --> 02:21:01,326
But there are certain concerns that have been raised by my neighbors.

1797
02:21:01,606 --> 02:21:02,326
I live in the neighborhood.

1798
02:21:02,346 --> 02:21:03,427
I live within walking distance.

1799
02:21:04,127 --> 02:21:08,070
I've heard about this application before I knew about it when it was coming across our table.

1800
02:21:09,311 --> 02:21:13,754
And it's been an issue of concern for some of the residents that live down there.

1801
02:21:14,375 --> 02:21:15,116
So I'm asking.

1802
02:21:17,865 --> 02:21:29,596
with the hope that you'll be willing to conduct a community meeting or an open house of some sort to allow people to come down so you can explain to them what it is you're doing, what it is you're trying to do in the neighborhood, and address some of the concerns that may have arisen.

1803
02:21:30,857 --> 02:21:38,844
Ultimately, because this is a special permit that's before the council, we do have the ability and the right to attach special conditions upon it, so on and so forth.

1804
02:21:39,805 --> 02:21:48,451
I'm not thinking this is going to be a tattoo parlor that has vulgar pictures hanging in the windows right across the street from a church that just doesn't fly anymore.

1805
02:21:48,932 --> 02:21:50,553
The days of those type of tattoos are over.

1806
02:21:51,273 --> 02:21:58,518
This type of art form has transformed from bikers, veterans, and people in jail to everybody.

1807
02:21:58,578 --> 02:22:00,360
The barista at the Starbucks has a tattoo now.

1808
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:04,261
The Reverend in Sanctuary Church has a tattoo, everybody has tattoos.

1809
02:22:04,281 --> 02:22:06,721
They're commonplace, they're normal.

1810
02:22:06,861 --> 02:22:10,222
But that doesn't alleviate some of the issues that have been brought up to me.

1811
02:22:10,502 --> 02:22:12,103
So I'm asking that you do that.

1812
02:22:12,223 --> 02:22:14,743
I'm on your own, I have no problem supporting this this evening.

1813
02:22:15,323 --> 02:22:30,167
However, I would ask that you at some point in time prior to opening, conduct just a small meeting with the residents and the neighbors and members of the parish to tell them what you're doing and to kind of explain to them what your aesthetics are going to be like so they don't have any fears as to any type of

1814
02:22:31,228 --> 02:22:31,508
God.

1815
02:22:32,549 --> 02:22:35,814
Imagery that may be offensive to the practice of their faith.

1816
02:22:37,437 --> 02:22:38,678
Of course, I would 100%

1817
02:22:40,193 --> 02:22:42,735
not just be willing, but love to actively do that.

1818
02:22:43,336 --> 02:22:49,701
It sounds like, as you were saying, you're not just hearing things from other people, but you also live in that area.

1819
02:22:50,221 --> 02:22:57,307
And if you would like to reach out, or I can reach out to you, maybe we could connect and you could help me get in touch with those folks.

1820
02:22:57,387 --> 02:23:03,232
And somehow we could set something up, whether it's in person or in Zoom, whatever people are most comfortable with.

1821
02:23:03,693 --> 02:23:04,473
And I would love that.

1822
02:23:05,534 --> 02:23:13,356
Because again, I don't want to just get in there and do business, but be some sort of a light in the community.

1823
02:23:13,656 --> 02:23:23,579
I think that's something that's really important about art, and hence the name Last Light, is that art has always been something really important in humanity.

1824
02:23:24,319 --> 02:23:25,340
It provides light.

1825
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:31,782
It provides love and a reminder that we are all connected in some bigger way.

1826
02:23:33,884 --> 02:23:49,912
I would be honored and love to have some sort of a either meeting, whether again, whether resume or whatnot with folks, not just to, uh, like, make them just just okay with it, but answer any questions and hopefully teach them something new.

1827
02:23:49,932 --> 02:23:51,873
That would be an awesome opportunity.

1828
02:23:51,933 --> 02:23:53,894
I'd love that.

1829
02:23:54,254 --> 02:23:55,775
Mr. President, I just asked that we put a

1830
02:23:56,452 --> 02:24:05,900
90-day review on it, just to be sure that the meeting happens and if any issues pop up, we can bring them back in and sit down and talk about what we can do to resolve them.

1831
02:24:06,460 --> 02:24:11,925
It's not a mechanism or a vehicle for us to come and yank your license away from you after three months or anything like that, Adam.

1832
02:24:11,945 --> 02:24:12,925
I don't want you worrying about that.

1833
02:24:13,286 --> 02:24:13,846
I appreciate that.

1834
02:24:13,866 --> 02:24:14,226
Thank you.

1835
02:24:14,246 --> 02:24:23,454
What it is is it's a mechanism for us to address some of the concerns that may come up during the first months of operation so that we can come up with a plan so that you can live harmoniously with the residents.

1836
02:24:24,214 --> 02:24:24,555
Of course.

1837
02:24:25,687 --> 02:24:26,587
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1838
02:24:26,607 --> 02:24:29,408
So that is an amendment by Councilor Knight for a 90 day review.

1839
02:24:30,009 --> 02:24:30,609
Councilor Morrell.

1840
02:24:31,609 --> 02:24:32,449
Thank you, Mr. President.

1841
02:24:32,749 --> 02:24:37,571
Yeah, I just have one more question thinking about signage and this, I support this paper.

1842
02:24:37,591 --> 02:24:43,553
So this is an kind of a inhibitor to that, but talking, so you mentioned signage in the windows.

1843
02:24:43,593 --> 02:24:49,755
I know there's currently just kind of the larger signage on the facade that exists at the current space.

1844
02:24:50,276 --> 02:24:52,316
Do you imagine you'll be using that as well?

1845
02:24:52,456 --> 02:24:53,076
And will that,

1846
02:24:55,037 --> 02:24:59,819
I'm just trying to think out loud and understand what this might look like in total, assuming that other tattoo place also.

1847
02:25:20,912 --> 02:25:25,233
day when I was speaking to the landlord about the signage.

1848
02:25:25,453 --> 02:25:31,474
And just to clarify, like, above the glass, there's, like, bigger signs for every business.

1849
02:25:31,534 --> 02:25:32,435
Is that what you're speaking about?

1850
02:25:32,475 --> 02:25:32,595
Yes.

1851
02:25:32,875 --> 02:25:33,095
Yeah.

1852
02:25:34,475 --> 02:25:34,795
Of course.

1853
02:25:35,255 --> 02:25:44,197
So I would put the last light name, but I was actually considering not putting Tattoo, because I thought it would be a little bit more

1854
02:25:45,103 --> 02:25:50,547
Again, I think it's important for me to be unassuming, especially because it is appointment only.

1855
02:25:50,887 --> 02:26:00,094
It's actually probably going to be easier for me, especially it's appointment only, and I would be the only person working there, to not have a bunch of people knocking on the door or something.

1856
02:26:00,234 --> 02:26:08,540
I don't foresee that happening because I'm going to have proper signage in order to indicate to people that if they are interested to check out the website, that it is appointment only.

1857
02:26:09,948 --> 02:26:13,610
But I don't necessarily want to advertise that way.

1858
02:26:13,630 --> 02:26:23,638
I think I've done a great job with word of mouth and just my reputation to be able to advertise that I don't really need the sign to actually read tattoo.

1859
02:26:23,778 --> 02:26:26,460
So that was actually something that I was probably just going to skip over.

1860
02:26:26,480 --> 02:26:30,983
And hopefully that also alleviates any concern.

1861
02:26:31,443 --> 02:26:31,903
you know, I don't know.

1862
02:26:31,923 --> 02:26:32,264
I don't know.

1863
02:26:32,284 --> 02:26:34,705
I don't have any information about having like it obvious that there's another tattoo shop.

1864
02:26:35,165 --> 02:26:40,869
It would probably look more like somebody was driving by somewhere between like a yoga studio and an art gallery.

1865
02:26:41,789 --> 02:26:44,391
Um, not so much a tattoo shop by any means.

1866
02:26:44,771 --> 02:26:45,332
Okay, Great.

1867
02:26:45,352 --> 02:26:45,592
Thank you.

1868
02:26:45,652 --> 02:26:47,373
And I thank you for entertaining that question.

1869
02:26:47,433 --> 02:26:48,453
I do support the paper.

1870
02:26:48,734 --> 02:26:52,796
I just know that, you know, there may be questions that we get from the community later on.

1871
02:26:52,856 --> 02:26:55,038
It's just making sure I can address those properly.

1872
02:26:55,058 --> 02:26:55,518
So thank you.

1873
02:27:00,865 --> 02:27:06,607
And Adam, you didn't come here for business advice, but I'll give a little marketing advice anyway.

1874
02:27:07,107 --> 02:27:10,848
Given your market, it might add to the brand exclusivity to do that.

1875
02:27:10,948 --> 02:27:13,409
So I think it might be a smart decision all around.

1876
02:27:13,849 --> 02:27:14,169
Thank you.

1877
02:27:15,730 --> 02:27:16,410
Yes, thank you.

1878
02:27:16,430 --> 02:27:18,451
And that's part of the consideration.

1879
02:27:18,551 --> 02:27:20,291
So I appreciate your encouragement.

1880
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:20,711
Thank you.

1881
02:27:21,292 --> 02:27:22,292
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

1882
02:27:23,332 --> 02:27:24,133
Okay, any other questions?

1883
02:27:26,994 --> 02:27:28,254
Okay, we'll share away to motion.

1884
02:27:29,445 --> 02:27:30,126
Motion to approve.

1885
02:27:31,046 --> 02:27:37,531

Mr. President, is there a B paper?

1889
02:27:47,599 --> 02:27:48,660
Sorry?

1890
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:50,661

1892
02:27:51,282 --> 02:27:51,862
Oh, I see.

1893
02:27:51,922 --> 02:27:54,084
There's a B paper.

1894
02:27:54,104 --> 02:27:56,465
We have a B paper from you, so we have to go to that first.

1895
02:27:57,384 --> 02:27:58,185
You had a B paper.

1896
02:27:58,225 --> 02:27:59,366
We have to vote on that first.

1897
02:28:00,307 --> 02:28:04,851
The B papers for a report on the status of the other, uh, the other tattoo studio that the council approved.

1898
02:28:04,891 --> 02:28:05,111
Okay.

02:28:05,291 --> 02:28:06,152

1901

Thank you.

1941

Mr. President, motion to revert to the regular order of business.

Yes.

1948
02:29:29,508 --> 02:29:29,988
Councilor Knight?

1949
02:29:30,068 --> 02:29:30,328
Yes.

1950
02:29:30,608 --> 02:29:31,229
Councilor Marks?

1951
02:29:31,269 --> 02:29:31,629
Yes.

1952
02:29:31,829 --> 02:29:32,509
Councilor Morrell?

1953
02:29:32,689 --> 02:29:32,910
Yes.

1954
02:29:33,150 --> 02:29:33,990
Councilor Scarpelli?

1955
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:34,190
Yes.

1956
02:29:34,370 --> 02:29:35,111
President Falco?

1957
02:29:35,311 --> 02:29:35,531
Yes.

1958
02:29:35,591 --> 02:29:36,992
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1959
02:29:37,012 --> 02:29:37,752
The motion passes.

1960
02:29:37,792 --> 02:29:40,234
We will now revert to the regular order of business.

1961
02:29:45,530 --> 02:29:46,711
That's a continuation.

1962
02:29:46,731 --> 02:29:47,972
It's a continued correct.

1963
02:29:48,012 --> 02:29:48,233
Yep.

1964
02:29:49,314 --> 02:29:57,680
Hearings two zero dash six zero zero petition for grant the location, national great gas main locations, Medford, Massachusetts city clerk's office.

1965
02:29:59,001 --> 02:30:01,183
This is a continuation of a public hearing.

1966
02:30:01,884 --> 02:30:03,285
Uh, we met with, um,

1967
02:30:04,120 --> 02:30:13,443
It was National Grid back a few weeks ago, and they were going to come before us tonight, and I think update us with a few questions.

1968
02:30:13,503 --> 02:30:15,044
We had a number of questions for them.

1969
02:30:15,884 --> 02:30:18,365
And let's see, we have Diana Cuddy with us.

1970
02:30:19,926 --> 02:30:20,466
Hi, Diana.

1971
02:30:22,046 --> 02:30:23,267
I'm going to unmute you right now.

1972
02:30:24,867 --> 02:30:26,008
Good evening.

1973
02:30:27,868 --> 02:30:29,209
And we also have, let's see, do we have,

1974
02:30:31,777 --> 02:30:33,298
Tim was here.

1975
02:30:33,518 --> 02:30:34,519
Tim McGiven was here.

1976
02:30:34,619 --> 02:30:42,064
Let me see if he's... Oh, there he is.

1977
02:30:43,024 --> 02:30:43,605
Sorry, Tim.

1978
02:30:48,108 --> 02:30:48,368
Okay.

1979
02:30:48,688 --> 02:30:49,869
Tim, I'll unmute you as well.

1980
02:30:52,530 --> 02:30:53,171
Okay.

1981
02:30:53,191 --> 02:31:00,936
So we have a number of, and I believe we received a memo this week also from the city engineer regarding

1982
02:31:01,538 --> 02:31:02,599
was it point number 12?

1983
02:31:02,859 --> 02:31:05,721
Am I correct?

1984
02:31:05,861 --> 02:31:07,703
Do you want to talk to that, Tim?

1985
02:31:09,384 --> 02:31:09,644
Sure.

1986
02:31:10,344 --> 02:31:16,789
So the memo was an update after the, I believe it was the first hearing with National Grid.

1987
02:31:17,930 --> 02:31:24,415
I spoke to MWRA shortly thereafter to go over the schedule.

1988
02:31:24,435 --> 02:31:30,359
And ultimately that ended up in a summary that is thus basically MWRA

1989
02:31:32,675 --> 02:31:37,618
they need to start at the beginning of spring because of the nature of their project.

1990
02:31:38,158 --> 02:31:50,346
So the lag time between when National Grid finishes their work and MWRA starts their work is going to be either eight months or 20 months.

1991
02:31:51,407 --> 02:32:01,193
So with that said, I revised my recommendation on number 12 to a mill and overlay restoration

1992
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:13,085
which would be pretty typical, you know, a 6 to 8 foot, 4 to 8 foot swath, depending on the pavement, for the run of the work.

1993
02:32:13,165 --> 02:32:21,088
So if there is that 20-month leg, we'll have a pavement that will last that 20 months.

1994
02:32:21,869 --> 02:32:28,932
So when MWRI comes in, obviously, they're going to dig the street up again, and then they'll resurface the whole thing, curb to curb.

1995
02:32:32,698 --> 02:32:35,199
Any of the cops have questions about that?

1996
02:32:35,219 --> 02:32:44,262
Okay.

1997
02:32:44,322 --> 02:32:45,323
And I believe.

1998
02:32:49,144 --> 02:32:49,944
So, Mr. President.

1999
02:32:50,645 --> 02:32:51,205
Cut the marks.

2000
02:32:52,112 --> 02:33:04,164
So last we left off, Mr. President, is that legal counsel from National Grid was going to speak to our acting city's solicitor regarding some mitigation.

2001
02:33:05,025 --> 02:33:09,370
And I'm very eager to hear what the results have been, Mr. President.

2002
02:33:10,112 --> 02:33:10,953
Thank you council.

2003
02:33:11,013 --> 02:33:12,295
Diana, could you speak to that please?

2004
02:33:12,495 --> 02:33:12,755
Sure.

2005
02:33:12,795 --> 02:33:13,456
Yes, of course.

2006
02:33:14,197 --> 02:33:15,839
Yes, we had a meeting on Friday.

2007
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:28,413
Our legal counsel, our staff engineer that designed the project and is working with MWRA's project manager and Tim and the existing city solicitor, Kim Scanlon.

2008
02:33:29,621 --> 02:33:48,945
And basically, Tim can correct me if I'm wrong, but we came under, came to the agreement that we will do the, National Geographic will do the video inspection of where our proposed work is going over the city's infrastructure to use as a baseline.

2009
02:33:49,025 --> 02:33:52,926
And then once we'll review that over the winter and work with

2010
02:33:53,785 --> 02:34:01,509
to see what the next steps would be, whether that's if we have the spot open, they come in and repair something that's in disrepair.

2011
02:34:02,109 --> 02:34:05,131
Anything we break, of course, we would fix if that's the case.

2012
02:34:06,372 --> 02:34:13,115
And then we understand the paving because of the lag time now with MWRA, that we would do that.

2013
02:34:13,495 --> 02:34:15,356
They would have reimbursed us for that.

2014
02:34:18,158 --> 02:34:21,079
And then I guess beyond that,

2015
02:34:23,170 --> 02:34:32,698
requesting that the council be amenable to removing the remaining conditions that, so that the ones that are above and beyond that.

2016
02:34:35,680 --> 02:34:38,322
And the city solicitor was in agreement with us.

2017
02:34:40,584 --> 02:34:42,445
So, Mr. President.

2018
02:34:43,166 --> 02:34:43,266
So,

2019
02:34:46,675 --> 02:35:00,407
I'm a little disappointed that we've waited this long to get that answer, because that answer does not address what this Memphis City Council has requested in regards to mitigation, Mr. President.

2020
02:35:01,148 --> 02:35:04,991
And if we have to rehash this, I'm willing to go over it again tonight.

2021
02:35:05,512 --> 02:35:13,138
But this council requested that some mitigation be put forth by either the MWRA or National Grid

2022
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:18,445
regarding the curbing on that stretch of Riverside F.

2023
02:35:19,738 --> 02:35:24,281
And we were told that originally they weren't willing to do the whole project.

2024
02:35:24,761 --> 02:35:28,703
I think this council stood up and said, we're not looking for you to do the whole project.

2025
02:35:29,024 --> 02:35:47,855
We're looking for you to set aside some money that we as a community can put into bringing the curbs up higher than the street, where much of the curbing is level with the road and very dangerous for pedestrian safety in that particular area, Mr. President.

2026
02:35:48,515 --> 02:35:57,261
And now we're hearing that as part of this project, it could be a lag of up to eight to 20 months.

2027
02:35:57,721 --> 02:36:04,005
So they may start the spring of 2021 and not finish for 20 months out, Mr. President.

2028
02:36:04,566 --> 02:36:15,733
And what they'll do is put down a binary code, coding, whatever it is, so that we can ride on it for 20 months while it looks like

2029
02:36:17,795 --> 02:36:19,397
you know, a pile of you know what.

2030
02:36:21,318 --> 02:36:23,180
It doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

2031
02:36:23,420 --> 02:36:24,962
This makes zero sense.

2032
02:36:25,322 --> 02:36:29,706
Why would we want, as a community, want to sit on a construction site for 20 months?

2033
02:36:30,547 --> 02:36:36,052
And the residents that have to live there, Mr. President, when they open their door and face that, Mr. President.

2034
02:36:37,154 --> 02:36:39,415
It just makes no sense to me at all.

2035
02:36:39,455 --> 02:36:50,520
I'm very disappointed that National Grid's not willing to step up, Mr. President, on a project of this size and help out the community in regards to mitigation.

2036
02:36:52,020 --> 02:36:53,761
They pay mitigation, Mr. President.

2037
02:36:54,782 --> 02:36:55,842
There's no bones about it.

2038
02:36:57,063 --> 02:36:59,984
Legal or not legal, they pay mitigation, Mr. President.

2039
02:37:00,762 --> 02:37:04,924
So if that's the case tonight, they don't have my vote, Mr. President.

2040
02:37:05,464 --> 02:37:06,944
They're not going to move forward with my vote.

2041
02:37:07,344 --> 02:37:08,985
Other members of the council may see fit.

2042
02:37:09,445 --> 02:37:12,446
But we got zero out of this project.

2043
02:37:13,046 --> 02:37:16,368
Nothing but inconvenience for the residents, Mr. President.

2044
02:37:16,588 --> 02:37:21,209
And don't forget, this started out with doing construction during the holiday season.

2045
02:37:21,790 --> 02:37:23,930
And then they pushed it a little further back.

2046
02:37:24,531 --> 02:37:28,012
And now we're hearing there could be a 20-month lag in between.

2047
02:37:28,985 --> 02:37:30,025
How does that benefit us?

2048
02:37:31,625 --> 02:37:34,846
Benefits their schedule, the MWRA and National Grid.

2049
02:37:35,086 --> 02:37:39,567
How does that benefit the city of Method on a major thoroughfare in our community?

2050
02:37:40,847 --> 02:37:41,987
It doesn't, Mr. President.

2051
02:37:42,307 --> 02:37:46,848
And if they're not willing to sit down and talk mitigation, they don't have this council's support.

2052
02:37:47,108 --> 02:37:53,649
And I hope my other council colleagues stand up too, Mr. President, on what's right on behalf of this community and its residents.

2053
02:37:54,870 --> 02:37:55,290
Thank you.

2054
02:37:55,490 --> 02:37:56,430
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2055
02:37:57,591 --> 02:37:59,492
Councilor Behrs and Councilor Scott Kelly.

2056
02:37:59,512 --> 02:38:00,252
Councilor Behrs.

2057
02:38:01,212 --> 02:38:01,993
And this is to Ms.

2058
02:38:02,033 --> 02:38:03,673
Cuddy or Mr. McGivern.

2059
02:38:04,173 --> 02:38:10,016
What is the cost amount we're talking about in terms of potential mitigation, like Councilor Marks just mentioned?

2060
02:38:13,197 --> 02:38:13,957
Tim, do you want?

2061
02:38:14,977 --> 02:38:21,660
Mitigation, in my opinion, is like mitigating something that, restoring it back to, you know,

2062
02:38:22,747 --> 02:38:26,288
it's original condition or acceptable condition.

2063
02:38:26,688 --> 02:38:44,732
So we are, because of the MWRA's lag in getting in right behind us, there's a, hopefully, it won't be the 20 months, but, so we would restore, the street would just be like a typical main relay where we would come back in, restore the pavement to the condition that it was in.

2064
02:38:45,502 --> 02:38:47,103
before or a little better.

2065
02:38:47,923 --> 02:38:49,523
And then they would come back in after us.

2066
02:38:49,563 --> 02:38:54,545
They would do their work and then, you know, they would do the curb to curb restoration.

2067
02:38:54,985 --> 02:39:00,407
And the benefit would be, you know, the city has new infrastructure there.

2068
02:39:00,447 --> 02:39:06,189
The MWRA has, I'm not exactly sure on their exact details of the project, but Tim can speak to that.

2069
02:39:07,370 --> 02:39:10,411
So there are some benefits to the city for this.

2070
02:39:11,628 --> 02:39:19,659
I just wanted to mention again, we were asked to move our stuff for the MWRA to come in and do this major project that they have.

2071
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:25,207
So, you know, we're being driven by them.

2072
02:39:25,227 --> 02:39:27,350
This wasn't a main relay we were anticipating.

2073
02:39:28,517 --> 02:39:32,198
Point of information, Mr. President.

2074
02:39:32,678 --> 02:39:33,719
Thank you, Mr. President.

2075
02:39:34,039 --> 02:39:37,340
My definition of mitigation may be a little different.

2076
02:39:38,521 --> 02:39:41,282
Restoring back to how it was is a given.

2077
02:39:41,822 --> 02:39:45,423
That's what happens on every utility project in this community.

2078
02:39:45,903 --> 02:39:50,185
Every utility project, they're required to return it back to the way it was.

2079
02:39:50,606 --> 02:39:53,187
Mitigation is going over and above, Mr. President.

2080
02:39:53,447 --> 02:39:54,788
We're asking over and above.

2081
02:39:55,068 --> 02:39:56,989
We're not asking to restore the way it was.

2082
02:39:57,349 --> 02:39:58,870
That's how every project is done.

2083
02:40:00,039 --> 02:40:03,782
So I'm not, I think our definition is a little different, Mr. President.

2084
02:40:04,322 --> 02:40:16,752
And, you know, it doesn't matter to me that National Grid's stepping in on behalf of, because they have to move their utility so the MWRA could do what they, it doesn't matter to me.

2085
02:40:16,772 --> 02:40:22,516
They're both utilities, Mr. President, and they both should step up to the plate and assist this community.

2086
02:40:23,197 --> 02:40:23,577
Thank you.

2087
02:40:24,638 --> 02:40:25,819
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2088
02:40:26,899 --> 02:40:27,860
Councilor Pierce, you had the floor.

2089
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:28,801
Just to answer,

2090
02:40:29,253 --> 02:40:37,800
to get an answer to the question, what's the difference between the cost of the full curb-to-curb resurfacing and the patching that you will be doing?

2091
02:40:40,222 --> 02:40:44,666
The difference in cost, I don't know.

2092
02:40:44,686 --> 02:40:45,907
Mr. McGibbon has an answer.

2093
02:40:45,927 --> 02:40:50,331
I mean, I can give you an estimate.

2094
02:40:50,591 --> 02:40:51,572
Yeah, back with an estimate.

2095
02:40:52,500 --> 02:41:02,525
We're talking about the difference between milling and overlay, the full width of the road, which is 20 some odd feet, versus milling and overlay, the trench patch.

2096
02:41:02,986 --> 02:41:11,510
So the trench patch mill and overlay is somewhere between typically five and eight feet, depending on the condition of the pavement surrounding it and how close or not to the curb it is.

2097
02:41:12,310 --> 02:41:18,854
So I can't give you a cost estimate based off of this information that I'm telling you now.

2098
02:41:19,418 --> 02:41:23,501
I'd have to take a much closer look at it and what would be required.

2099
02:41:24,262 --> 02:41:27,704
If full rebuilds need to happen in places when they do the final resurfacing, I don't know.

2100
02:41:27,724 --> 02:41:29,525
Are we talking a million dollars, $100,000, $50,000?

2101
02:41:29,585 --> 02:41:32,007
We're not talking seven-figure million dollars worth of work, no.

2102
02:41:41,258 --> 02:41:46,440
The order of magnitude is more than double if that's helpful.

2103
02:41:46,520 --> 02:41:52,623
So more than double the cost for a full resurface versus less than half of the width of the roadway.

2104
02:41:52,763 --> 02:41:55,285
But either way, it would be under a million dollars.

2105
02:41:56,045 --> 02:41:56,505
Oh, yeah.

2106
02:41:56,765 --> 02:41:58,026
Yeah, I think it would be.

2107
02:41:58,246 --> 02:41:58,866
I think it would be.

2108
02:41:58,887 --> 02:41:59,207
Yeah.

2109
02:41:59,607 --> 02:41:59,827
All right.

2110
02:42:00,167 --> 02:42:03,769
And Miss Cuddy, what was the annual profit of National Grid last year?

2111
02:42:07,223 --> 02:42:19,290
I think it's something like 90% into renewable, like figuring out better ways to do zero carbon.

2112
02:42:19,370 --> 02:42:23,232
I don't know what their net profit or gross profit was, though.

2113
02:42:23,713 --> 02:42:25,234
I think it's in the billions of dollars.

2114
02:42:25,434 --> 02:42:27,376
And then where is National Grid headquartered?

2115
02:42:27,436 --> 02:42:29,498
The international headquarters?

2116
02:42:30,219 --> 02:42:31,460
In Waltham, Massachusetts.

2117
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:31,760
No.

2118
02:42:31,800 --> 02:42:37,685
But I did want to say that... No, where is National Grid headquartered internationally?

2119
02:42:39,827 --> 02:42:41,888
The headquarters is in Waltham, Massachusetts.

2120
02:42:42,329 --> 02:42:43,810
But where is the corporate ownership?

2121
02:42:43,830 --> 02:42:44,411
Where do they live?

2122
02:42:44,491 --> 02:42:44,711
England.

2123
02:42:47,412 --> 02:42:52,594
We're owned through the UK, but the corporate headquarters is in Waltham, Massachusetts.

2124
02:42:52,614 --> 02:42:52,774
Got it.

2125
02:42:52,854 --> 02:42:59,016
So there's like billions of dollars in profits from a foreign company, and we can't spend less than a million dollars on a street in Medford.

2126
02:42:59,136 --> 02:42:59,957
Thank you, Mr. President.

2127
02:43:01,357 --> 02:43:03,178
Mr. Counselor Beers, Counselor Scott Pelley.

2128
02:43:04,298 --> 02:43:08,660
So again, Mr. President, I'm sorry we're going down this hole again.

2129
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:09,780
And Ms.

2130
02:43:09,800 --> 02:43:14,922
Cuddy seems to be the spokesperson that has to take the brunt of this.

2131
02:43:16,228 --> 02:43:27,929
I find it amazing that it has to be National Grid that comes before us because of an MWA problem that then reflects back to a National Grid problem.

2132
02:43:29,443 --> 02:43:35,028
Why aren't we sitting together with National Grid, I mean with MWRA?

2133
02:43:35,668 --> 02:43:47,618
Why don't we have all of the parties together in a room that they can understand what the constituents, what the residents of Riverside Ave have been hearing that is absolutely frightening them.

2134
02:43:48,059 --> 02:43:52,783
The understanding that close to two years they're going to look at a major

2135
02:43:54,131 --> 02:43:58,132
major concerns that they're going to be dealing with for 20 months, possibly.

2136
02:43:59,033 --> 02:44:19,079
So this is why I can't support this, because we still haven't gotten the answers for this counselor to go back to the constituents that live on Riverside Ave and talk to those people and say, we've dotted all the I's and crossed all the T's, and this is what we're going to have, and this is what's going to happen.

2137
02:44:19,439 --> 02:44:21,600
Because this is a major project.

2138
02:44:22,499 --> 02:44:25,660
So I don't know if Tim can answer this, Ms.

2139
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:34,564
Cuddy, I'm sorry, but we haven't talked to any representative from the MWRA and this community gives a lot of funding.

2140
02:44:36,074 --> 02:44:41,795
And we need to get their representatives here so we can talk to them and say, what are we doing?

2141
02:44:41,855 --> 02:44:44,356
Why can't this be done simultaneously?

2142
02:44:44,416 --> 02:45:01,100
Why can't we look at the mitigation for the curbs where it's a city, it's MWRA, it's National Grid working together to make sure that we can use all three entities to fix a problem that could go away if there's a way to work together.

2143
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:02,920
Maybe it's not a million dollars for National Grid.

2144
02:45:03,978 --> 02:45:05,218
Maybe it's a third.

2145
02:45:05,298 --> 02:45:06,739
Maybe it's a third for the city of Medford.

2146
02:45:06,759 --> 02:45:08,179
Maybe it's a third for MWRA.

2147
02:45:08,480 --> 02:45:09,700
But we haven't talked about that.

2148
02:45:10,120 --> 02:45:17,262
All we keep trying to do is push the same 13, 14 points that keep coming back that's not appeasing.

2149
02:45:17,543 --> 02:45:22,304
Forget about me, because honestly, I live in North Medford.

2150
02:45:22,324 --> 02:45:22,864
I live in the Heights.

2151
02:45:24,245 --> 02:45:31,127
The people that are there every single day, that when they heard 20 months now, is absolutely frightening.

2152
02:45:31,267 --> 02:45:33,128
So can anybody speak to that?

2153
02:45:34,124 --> 02:45:38,626
So yes, I can say our portion of the project, we would be done in six weeks.

2154
02:45:39,306 --> 02:45:47,109
So we would start excavation, do the main relay and do the paving that Tim mentioned in six weeks.

2155
02:45:47,850 --> 02:45:55,433
The other piece I just wanted to mention is, and if you wanted to see the letter that our legal counsel set up, it cites,

2156
02:45:57,088 --> 02:46:05,174
SJC state law that, so this type of project, because this isn't a new main, it's a main replacement.

2157
02:46:05,654 --> 02:46:07,656
These costs go back to the rate payers.

2158
02:46:07,696 --> 02:46:18,323
They go into the rate case and we are legally obligated to keep, to not have like above and beyond what the cost of the construction is.

2159
02:46:19,864 --> 02:46:25,548
So it's a legal obligation on our part for this particular type of work.

2160
02:46:25,883 --> 02:46:33,368
Well, and I can understand what you have to do for your position, but you also have to understand what I have to and we have to do in our positions.

2161
02:46:33,829 --> 02:46:33,969
Ms.

2162
02:46:33,989 --> 02:46:44,416
Cuddy, Tim, I think, what conversations, what discussions have we had with the MWRA that is this something that we can do?

2163
02:46:45,637 --> 02:46:52,783
We're talking about a 20 month project that has to be approved by an organization, National Grid, that's saying they're only going to be here for six weeks.

2164
02:46:53,563 --> 02:47:01,733
It seems like they're going to be in and out, but then the other organization that has nothing to do with this permit right now, it's going to take 20 months possibly.

2165
02:47:02,514 --> 02:47:05,898
Can you help us so we can answer the questions to those residents?

2166
02:47:08,576 --> 02:47:11,097
to the chair, it's not a 20-month project.

2167
02:47:11,237 --> 02:47:12,537
It's a 20-month leg.

2168
02:47:13,097 --> 02:47:22,960
So they need to be able, MWA needs to start in the beginning of the construction season so they can complete by the end of the construction season.

2169
02:47:23,440 --> 02:47:26,441
So their start time for the year is a spring.

2170
02:47:26,861 --> 02:47:34,143
So if it's not next spring, eight months away, then it's the following spring after that, 20 months, and so on and so forth.

2171
02:47:36,531 --> 02:47:38,574
It's just a lag, it's not the project.

2172
02:47:38,614 --> 02:47:41,638
So during those 20 months, there's no construction happening on the streets.

2173
02:47:41,658 --> 02:47:49,147
Okay, so that's the fear that when you hear, now to a traffic engineer, a lag sounds perfect.

2174
02:47:49,947 --> 02:47:56,830
To Mrs. Smith, who lives on Riverside Ave, who's 74 years old, that only place to park is her driveway, Tim.

2175
02:47:57,211 --> 02:47:57,991
This is what I'm saying.

2176
02:47:58,011 --> 02:48:00,592
I'm not trying to cause any, I'm not trying to be negative.

2177
02:48:00,612 --> 02:48:05,655
I'm trying to find a way that we can say, okay, so the way it sounds, it's coming out.

2178
02:48:05,995 --> 02:48:09,237
National Grid's going to do six weeks of work, rip up the road, leave.

2179
02:48:10,157 --> 02:48:12,759
And just go over it with overlay.

2180
02:48:12,979 --> 02:48:22,144
And then the residents are going to have to deal possibly up to 20 months with delays with this type of road that they have to drive on, walk on every single day.

2181
02:48:25,746 --> 02:48:27,047
President, I can address that?

2182
02:48:27,267 --> 02:48:27,927
Yes, please, Tim.

2183
02:48:28,848 --> 02:48:29,308
Sure.

2184
02:48:29,328 --> 02:48:35,051
So the service restoration that National Grid would do under this scenario,

2185
02:48:37,180 --> 02:48:43,922
From my understanding of Riverside Ave, I've driven it a couple times recently to understand a little bit better for these conversations.

2186
02:48:44,623 --> 02:48:47,824
It would be significantly better than what's even there today.

2187
02:48:48,244 --> 02:48:54,306
So I think doing a grind and an overlay, that's a legitimate resurfacing job.

2188
02:48:54,386 --> 02:49:02,629
So that lane or half of Riverside that is done after National Grid does their six weeks of work,

2189
02:49:03,886 --> 02:49:09,728
It's not just, it's going to hold up for the 20 months plus.

2190
02:49:09,769 --> 02:49:13,750
I mean, that's what usually we would see for final restoration on some streets.

2191
02:49:14,630 --> 02:49:17,272
So it's kind of up there with final restoration.

2192
02:49:17,312 --> 02:49:24,815
It's just not the whole road, because it wouldn't make sense, really, to have National Grid do a curb-to-curb mill and overlay.

2193
02:49:25,215 --> 02:49:32,398
Because MWRA is coming back at some point in the beginning of A spring to open up pits so they can do their line project.

2194
02:49:33,757 --> 02:49:34,397
And things like that.

2195
02:49:34,437 --> 02:49:39,338
So that 20 months, there's no construction during that 20 months.

2196
02:49:39,438 --> 02:49:40,839
Say that the lag is 20.

2197
02:49:41,239 --> 02:49:42,119
It could be shorter than that.

2198
02:49:42,139 --> 02:49:42,679
It could be eight.

2199
02:49:43,099 --> 02:49:46,480
But if it is 20, then we'll have a street.

2200
02:49:46,600 --> 02:49:51,381
It's not going to be the pothole-ridden street that we might be envisioning.

2201
02:49:51,441 --> 02:49:55,742
It's going to be nice, smooth pavement or a chunk of it, the chunk that

2202
02:49:56,393 --> 02:50:00,375
So that piece is going to be nicer than the rest of Riverside Avenue.

2203
02:50:01,836 --> 02:50:07,399
But unfortunately, then MWR will come in and dig it up, and then grind it, and then repay it.

2204
02:50:07,879 --> 02:50:13,662
So just to set expectations, that 20 months, that's not construction.

2205
02:50:13,702 --> 02:50:15,883
That's just regular Riverside Avenue.

2206
02:50:16,223 --> 02:50:18,725
OK, so thank you for clarifying.

2207
02:50:19,025 --> 02:50:21,646
Like I said, that's one of the biggest questions I've been fielding.

2208
02:50:22,046 --> 02:50:24,968
And I think I concur with Council Marks

2209
02:50:26,550 --> 02:50:31,733
Maybe there is, have we had a discussion with all three entities to say, Ms.

2210
02:50:31,753 --> 02:50:38,658
Cutty says that the amount of mitigation with how much money they're putting into it, it doesn't equate.

2211
02:50:38,738 --> 02:50:47,264
But has there been discussion where the three entities have worked together to try to fix a wrong that is Riverside Ave curbing?

2212
02:50:47,604 --> 02:50:53,728
Just in that, especially for me, that locust turn and probably up to the next,

2213
02:50:56,119 --> 02:51:01,825
The next intersection, the next street, like I said, I don't think it's monumental.

2214
02:51:01,845 --> 02:51:04,128
I don't think it's all 1,400 feet.

2215
02:51:05,389 --> 02:51:13,538
So again, I'd like to hear, we could have that conversation to try to fix that wrong, so thank you.

2216
02:51:14,900 --> 02:51:15,601
Thank you, Councilor.

2217
02:51:15,621 --> 02:51:17,503
Scott Kelly, Vice President Carviello.

2218
02:51:18,445 --> 02:51:19,165
Thank you, Mr. President.

2219
02:51:21,306 --> 02:51:23,607
Over the last few weeks, we've been beating this back and forth.

2220
02:51:24,547 --> 02:51:27,768
I kind of feel bad for National Grid, because this isn't their project.

2221
02:51:29,909 --> 02:51:35,250
It's an MWRA project, and MWRA is nowhere to be seen or heard for that.

2222
02:51:35,590 --> 02:51:40,812
I say we don't have any more discussions on this until the MWRA comes up, steps up to the table.

2223
02:51:42,323 --> 02:51:47,986
I mean, again, they're doing this at the request of the MWRA.

2224
02:51:48,526 --> 02:51:52,108
This isn't their project, and we're killing them.

2225
02:51:53,409 --> 02:52:04,575
It's really not fair, and I say at the next meeting that this go no further until the MWRA officials come before us, Mr. President.

2226
02:52:06,116 --> 02:52:07,177
Thank you, Vice President Carviel.

2227
02:52:09,297 --> 02:52:15,540
Mr. President, the notes I have say, I said, why don't we move to have a committee of the whole with the MWRA and National Grid over the project and mitigation?

2228
02:52:16,020 --> 02:52:19,762
I mean, ultimately, National Grid wouldn't even be here if it wasn't because MWRA asked them to.

2229
02:52:20,322 --> 02:52:30,406
And as I looked at the heat map just a couple weeks ago, the map that allows us to take a look at the gas leaks in the area, we've had a significant number of gas leaks along that street.

2230
02:52:30,446 --> 02:52:32,367
That we're going to remain on that street is gas leaks.

2231
02:52:32,547 --> 02:52:38,430
National Grid admittedly had no intention of coming down there and repairing any of those unless they really had to, unless they were grade one gas leaks.

2232
02:52:39,470 --> 02:52:49,456
You know, so I'm looking at this project and I'm saying to myself, you know, National Grid was never going to come here unless MWRA asked them to.

2233
02:52:49,516 --> 02:52:51,678
Now that they're coming here, they are going to make repairs.

2234
02:52:52,058 --> 02:52:53,038
Okay, that's all well and good.

2235
02:52:53,359 --> 02:52:54,559
But this isn't about the project.

2236
02:52:54,599 --> 02:53:00,083
This is about mitigation to the residents in the neighborhood that are going to be forced to put up with the construction that's going on down there, right?

2237
02:53:00,623 --> 02:53:06,947
So the one question I do have would be for the city engineer and it's, you know, is there a code relative to

2238
02:53:08,692 --> 02:53:16,175
a safety code or a building code or a construction code relative to sidewalk and curving height in relation to the street.

2239
02:53:17,055 --> 02:53:31,201
And if there is, when we're allowing these public utilities to come in our community and restore them to equal or better condition, we're really letting them come in and establish something that's not up to code.

2240
02:53:33,545 --> 02:53:41,914
I mean, if someone were to come into this building, when we built the new police station, we had to make sure that it met the seismic requirements that were necessary for a building of that nature.

2241
02:53:41,954 --> 02:53:47,621
We had to take into consideration the floodplain and all these different other items when we were building a new building.

2242
02:53:48,161 --> 02:53:53,387
When we renovate buildings, we talked about the renovation of certain homes in the community.

2243
02:53:53,887 --> 02:53:57,270
And we have to bring those homes up to code when they're given a building permit.

2244
02:53:57,310 --> 02:54:01,473
So I guess my question is, is there a code relative to sidewalk height in relation to the street?

2245
02:54:01,853 --> 02:54:08,678
And why are we allowing public utilities to come into our community and restore them to the condition they were in and not up to code if there is in fact a code?

2246
02:54:09,419 --> 02:54:11,300
Which there probably isn't, that's why we're letting them do it.

2247
02:54:12,521 --> 02:54:14,203
Tim, would you be able to address that?

2248
02:54:15,424 --> 02:54:15,984
Yep.

2249
02:54:16,024 --> 02:54:17,185
Thank you, President DeFranco.

2250
02:54:17,845 --> 02:54:21,168
So there is codes associated with ADA accessibility

2251
02:54:21,887 --> 02:54:25,489
And there's also guidance and all kinds of case law.

2252
02:54:26,190 --> 02:54:44,922
So if something is not to code and it's within reason for them to fix it, a utility company that exposes it, say, for example, there's a sidewalk panel that's cracked and it doesn't have a pimple pad on it, which a lot of people call those truncated combs.

2253
02:54:45,842 --> 02:54:52,965
Then, yes, we would ask that when they put the sidewalk panel back, that they install one of those to bring it up to code.

2254
02:54:53,525 --> 02:54:55,006
So it's a question of reason.

2255
02:54:55,086 --> 02:54:59,567
So when we look at it and we say, this infrastructure is getting dismantled.

2256
02:54:59,748 --> 02:55:04,950
When they put it back, is there anything reasonable that they should be doing to get it up to code?

2257
02:55:06,090 --> 02:55:08,351
Now, of course, there's nuances to this.

2258
02:55:09,131 --> 02:55:12,353
So existing conditions fall under the code as well.

2259
02:55:17,218 --> 02:55:22,404
But to repair those slopes would have you chasing grades up the street, for example.

2260
02:55:22,864 --> 02:55:27,369
That could be deemed unreasonable, and at an expense above and beyond what would be considered reasonable.

2261
02:55:27,813 --> 02:55:30,934
what the legal obligations of the utility entity are.

2262
02:55:31,794 --> 02:55:33,495
So we do look at that.

2263
02:55:33,595 --> 02:55:44,859
So for this particular situation, and I know we have talked about it in previous hearings, the city is looking at opportunities to improve this particular block of curbing.

2264
02:55:45,199 --> 02:55:46,620
I've looked at it a couple times now.

2265
02:55:47,920 --> 02:55:49,141
So, you know, there is,

2266
02:55:50,807 --> 02:55:54,808
And I've also been looking at what the obligations are, what the rules are.

2267
02:55:55,409 --> 02:56:03,811
And Councilor Knight, as you know, I have community mitigation on my to-do, and we're trying to figure out how to do that.

2268
02:56:04,992 --> 02:56:15,155
But just from a straight opening the street and then returning the street, we do have statutes to work from, and we do have understandings of what's reasonable and what's not reasonable.

2269
02:56:15,515 --> 02:56:19,877
And those are the lenses that we really try to look at these projects when we're trying to

2270
02:56:20,877 --> 02:56:22,799
to ask for certain things.

2271
02:56:23,719 --> 02:56:25,101
And you're right.

2272
02:56:25,401 --> 02:56:32,606
Can we get it to code, ADA code, pretty reasonably in the project if they're opening it up anyway?

2273
02:56:34,187 --> 02:56:37,170
Or is it something where it's unreasonable to bring it up to code?

2274
02:56:37,290 --> 02:56:40,933
So we are, of course, looking at that sort of thing.

2275
02:56:41,673 --> 02:56:53,317
If they're not working the sidewalk and the sidewalk needs design work and it has rippling implications for raising it, then we do need to go through a design effort.

2276
02:56:53,377 --> 02:57:01,880
We do need to take a look at what all the implications are of that particular stretch of curbing.

2277
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:04,381
So it is definitely not as easy as just

2278
02:57:05,725 --> 02:57:08,466
raise the curb and make it better.

2279
02:57:08,546 --> 02:57:10,567
It requires some careful design.

2280
02:57:10,927 --> 02:57:13,728
And there isn't a code that says what height the curb should be.

2281
02:57:14,128 --> 02:57:15,528
It's more of standards.

2282
02:57:15,748 --> 02:57:23,731
So the city has a set book of standards that we look at when anybody does any road work in the city that we're going to ask them to meet.

2283
02:57:25,093 --> 02:57:44,803
And in terms of the gorilla in the room, the elephant in the room, whatever you want to call it, MWRA, have you sat down with MWRA and discussed the further criteria of the mitigation agreement or the requests and recommendations that your office has related to their project when they come on board?

2284
02:57:44,823 --> 02:57:46,283
Or is this still a little premature for that?

2285
02:57:48,684 --> 02:57:49,765
It's not premature.

2286
02:57:49,885 --> 02:57:53,807
So we have been talking to MWRA about this project for some time.

2287
02:57:54,563 --> 02:57:55,924
We've met with them.

2288
02:57:56,165 --> 02:58:02,170
I don't know if we've actually had all three entities, City of MWRA and National Grid, all in the same meeting or call.

2289
02:58:02,550 --> 02:58:04,912
But we have been referring to each other.

2290
02:58:04,992 --> 02:58:10,977
And the bulk of the conversation with MWRA has been what their scope of their project is.

2291
02:58:11,057 --> 02:58:12,439
It's not just Riverside Avenue.

2292
02:58:12,479 --> 02:58:14,080
It's a couple of other places in the city.

2293
02:58:14,899 --> 02:58:23,602
And also, too, the restoration work that MWRA is providing, they've worked with us on that.

2294
02:58:24,462 --> 02:58:29,464
Again, they fall under the same set of obligations as any other utility company opening on our streets.

2295
02:58:31,545 --> 02:58:39,248
Mr. President, I think at this point, I'm very comfortable echoing the sentiments of Councilor Scott Pele and Councilor Caviello that

2296
02:58:41,605 --> 02:58:42,586
The city engineer just said it.

2297
02:58:43,046 --> 02:58:44,928
These three parties haven't even been in the same room.

2298
02:58:45,929 --> 02:58:55,218
So I would suggest an offer in the way of a motion that we have a committee of the whole with the MWRA National Grid, as well as representatives from the administration to discuss this permit and mitigation.

2299
02:58:56,299 --> 02:58:57,941
On that motion, I'll provide council a night.

2300
02:58:58,001 --> 02:58:58,281
Second.

2301
02:58:58,822 --> 02:59:00,363
Seconded by Councilor Scarapelli.

2302
02:59:03,607 --> 02:59:04,708
Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2303
02:59:08,980 --> 02:59:09,581
Councilor Behrs?

2304
02:59:09,621 --> 02:59:09,881
Yes.

2305
02:59:10,281 --> 02:59:11,162
Vice President Caravaglio?

2306
02:59:11,182 --> 02:59:11,242
Yes.

2307
02:59:11,882 --> 02:59:12,383
Councilor Night?

2308
02:59:12,423 --> 02:59:12,663
Yes.

2309
02:59:12,923 --> 02:59:13,463
Councilor Marks?

2310
02:59:13,483 --> 02:59:14,104
Yes.

2311
02:59:14,144 --> 02:59:14,744
Councilor Morrell?

2312
02:59:14,925 --> 02:59:15,165
Yes.

2313
02:59:15,425 --> 02:59:16,145
Councilor Scarpelli?

2314
02:59:16,165 --> 02:59:16,406
Yes.

2315
02:59:16,706 --> 02:59:17,406
President Falco?

2316
02:59:17,647 --> 02:59:17,887
Yes.

2317
02:59:18,587 --> 02:59:20,048
Sending the affirmative, zeroing the negative.

2318
02:59:20,849 --> 02:59:25,953
This motion passes and I will schedule a committee to hold

2319
02:59:27,320 --> 02:59:33,543
If not, it might be President Capiello that does it in the next term, just because we're running out of time in the month of December.

2320
02:59:35,284 --> 02:59:38,966
But we will schedule a committee to hold on this, hopefully sooner than later.

2321
02:59:40,667 --> 02:59:45,509
On the main paper, is there a motion to put on the table, or?

2322
02:59:46,770 --> 02:59:51,012
Okay, on the motion of council, I'll ask to table the main paper, seconded by.

2323
02:59:53,503 --> 02:59:56,005
Seconded by Vice President Carviello, Clerk Artemis.

2324
02:59:56,846 --> 02:59:59,828
Clerk Artemis, please come to the hall.

2325
03:00:00,748 --> 03:00:04,331
So you've moved the committee to the hall, and you're tabling the main paper until it comes out?

2326
03:00:05,271 --> 03:00:05,952
Is that the resolution?

2327
03:00:06,012 --> 03:00:06,232
OK.

2328
03:00:06,852 --> 03:00:07,413
Councilor Behrs?

2329
03:00:07,913 --> 03:00:08,113
Yes.

2330
03:00:09,854 --> 03:00:10,615
Vice President Carviello?

2331
03:00:10,795 --> 03:00:10,995
Yes.

2332
03:00:11,976 --> 03:00:12,436
Councilor Knight?

2333
03:00:12,596 --> 03:00:12,836
Yes.

2334
03:00:13,417 --> 03:00:13,957
Councilor Marks?

2335
03:00:14,418 --> 03:00:14,638
Yes.

2336
03:00:14,918 --> 03:00:15,498
Councilor Morrell?

2337
03:00:15,778 --> 03:00:16,019
Yes.

2338
03:00:16,299 --> 03:00:17,019
Councilor Scarpelli?

2339
03:00:17,099 --> 03:00:17,360
Yes.

2340
03:00:17,540 --> 03:00:18,200
President Falco?

2341
03:00:18,220 --> 03:00:18,400
Yes.

2342
03:00:18,440 --> 03:00:20,442
Seven in favor of adjournment, I get the motion passes.

2343
03:00:26,241 --> 03:00:31,581
It was cut to a mark seconded by Vice President Carvio.

2344
03:00:36,552 --> 03:00:40,755
Motions, orders, and resolutions 20-660 offered by Councilor Morrell.

2345
03:00:41,335 --> 03:01:00,529
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request a briefing on the administration's newly established commission on parking policy and enforcement from the chairs of the commission, Jim Silva and Laurel Ruma, and be provided an explanation of the purpose of the commission as well as the due date for the commission's findings report.

2346
03:01:01,690 --> 03:01:02,291
Councilor Morrell.

2347
03:01:02,897 --> 03:01:03,878
Thank you, Mr. President.

2348
03:01:04,099 --> 03:01:07,843
I believe this paper speaks for itself, and I'll let the chair speak soon.

2349
03:01:07,863 --> 03:01:16,013
And I apologize that the second item on the agenda took us till 10 o'clock to get to, but I know they're very much used to these meetings, so I thank them for their patience.

2350
03:01:16,714 --> 03:01:20,619
But I'm the council rep on this commission, and there's a number of

2351
03:01:21,239 --> 03:01:31,606
community members and business owners who've been working very hard, regular meetings, weekly meetings, and doing a lot of work out in the community to move forward a number of issues around this.

2352
03:01:31,726 --> 03:01:34,387
I'll hand it over to Jim and Laurel to speak on this more.

2353
03:01:35,808 --> 03:01:36,529
Thank you, Councilor.

2354
03:01:41,216 --> 03:01:41,877
If I may, one minute.

2355
03:01:41,937 --> 03:01:42,877
Councilor Knight.

2356
03:01:43,077 --> 03:01:48,418
Just a couple of weeks ago, Mr. President, a similar item came upon the agenda and we discussed that.

2357
03:01:48,838 --> 03:02:01,620
It's very important when we get updates from bodies, boards, commissions, the administration, that these updates are provided to us in writing so that we have that snapshot in time so that when the item comes up again at a later date, we have something to compare it to, Mr. President.

2358
03:02:01,680 --> 03:02:03,361
And I'd hope that that still stands.

2359
03:02:04,601 --> 03:02:04,761
Yes.

2360
03:02:05,889 --> 03:02:11,234
So if you're going to give us an update tonight, could you also please give it to us in writing?

2361
03:02:12,435 --> 03:02:16,018
That would be greatly appreciated.

2362
03:02:16,038 --> 03:02:21,404
Just so we have, I guess, a point of reference as to what we spoke at during the meeting.

2363
03:02:23,466 --> 03:02:24,286
Absolutely.

2364
03:02:24,366 --> 03:02:26,068
So my name is Laurel Ruma, 149 Burgett Avenue.

2365
03:02:28,108 --> 03:02:32,011
And just for clarification, this is the first time we've been before the council on this issue.

2366
03:02:32,111 --> 03:02:39,435
So this is an establishment of the commission, not necessarily an update, but going forward, it's noted and we will provide them in writing.

2367
03:02:41,716 --> 03:02:43,697
My co-chair is Jim Silva.

2368
03:02:45,478 --> 03:02:47,199
Jim Silva, 115 Yale street.

2369
03:02:48,360 --> 03:02:56,785
And the two of us have been appointed by the mayor to develop a, as well as other members of the commission and the purpose of

2370
03:02:57,295 --> 03:03:08,858
the Parking Policy and Enforcement Commission is to go by her purposes of establishment.

2371
03:03:09,078 --> 03:03:14,999
And so for the purpose of the record, it'd be good to go over her founding of this commission and why.

2372
03:03:16,439 --> 03:03:20,220
And this is all public record, but again, we'll put it in the package for you.

2373
03:03:21,555 --> 03:03:29,901
Mayor's Commission on Parking Policy and Enforcement, I hereby establish this committee, the Mayor's Commission on Parking Policy and Enforcement, for the following purpose.

2374
03:03:30,682 --> 03:03:38,047
One, to evaluate the City of Medford's current policies pertaining to on-street parking in residential, commercial, and industrial areas.

2375
03:03:39,108 --> 03:03:47,734
Two, to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of area-wide parking policies as it relates to the MBTA Green Line Extension, scheduled to open late 2021.

2376
03:03:49,773 --> 03:03:56,158
Three, to study the fees currently assessed for on-street parking in the city of Medford, including meters, passes, and permits.

2377
03:03:57,139 --> 03:04:00,441
Four, to study the methods of parking fee collection in the city of Medford.

2378
03:04:01,102 --> 03:04:08,668
Five, to evaluate the city of Medford's current arrangement of parking enforcement to wit the outsourcing of parking administration and enforcement to a third party vendor.

2379
03:04:09,448 --> 03:04:13,872
And six, to make recommendations of the policy changes to her honor the mayor if necessary.

2380
03:04:17,554 --> 03:04:20,375
the following individuals are the designees of applicable.

2381
03:04:21,076 --> 03:04:24,317
One resident appointed by the Mayor to serve as chairperson.

2382
03:04:24,337 --> 03:04:26,458
You get two.

2383
03:04:26,538 --> 03:04:29,979
No fewer than three residents and or business owners of the City of Medford appointed by the Mayor.

2384
03:04:29,999 --> 03:04:31,480
A member of City Council, which is Councilor Morrell.

2385
03:04:31,500 --> 03:04:33,861
A member of City Council, which is Councilor Lueb.

2386
03:04:34,950 --> 03:04:38,952
and the chief of police of Medford and or his designee.

2387
03:04:39,592 --> 03:04:43,153
City staff shall be made available to the commission to assist with completing this charge.

2388
03:04:43,213 --> 03:04:50,036
The commission is directed to begin work immediately and submit a report to the mayor with the recommendations by March 31st, 2021.

2389
03:04:50,716 --> 03:04:54,057
This was signed by the mayor, October 5th.

2390
03:04:54,857 --> 03:05:04,181
And from that point on, Jim Silva and I have been part of this commission and the members of the commission are the following people.

2391
03:05:04,846 --> 03:05:06,928
Um, many who are still on the call.

2392
03:05:06,948 --> 03:05:12,252
Thank you all very much for being here, including Morgan Carroll, Pam Cirillo, D.J.

2393
03:05:12,292 --> 03:05:23,201
Benigno, Nicole Morrell, Jeffrey Mung, Saketh Rama, Fred Roche, myself, Laurel Siegel, and Jim Silva.

2394
03:05:23,741 --> 03:05:30,747
And the Police Department representative has been Sergeant Hartnett, um, as well as at times the chief himself, which has been very helpful.

2395
03:05:32,410 --> 03:05:45,414
So our charges as the commission is to look at what the current parking situation is now, how it can be improved for both business districts and residential, as well as the fees, et cetera.

2396
03:05:45,594 --> 03:05:48,875
So we are currently meeting every Wednesday at 7 p.m.

2397
03:05:49,475 --> 03:05:53,497
We welcome any public input to these meetings.

2398
03:05:54,506 --> 03:05:56,928
We have divided ourselves up into two committees.

2399
03:05:57,148 --> 03:06:01,632
One committee is focused on residential, one on commercial business.

2400
03:06:02,353 --> 03:06:12,041
And the status so far of the residential meeting has been to reach out to neighboring communities to get an understanding of their parking situations.

2401
03:06:13,538 --> 03:06:18,100
We are a differing and complex community, as we all know.

2402
03:06:19,280 --> 03:06:32,845
The important part about the Mayor's charge is to really look at the areas that are surrounding the MBTA, the new Greenline stations that are coming in, and that's at College and Boston Avenue near Tufts University, as well as Ball Square.

2403
03:06:34,445 --> 03:06:42,808
So although we are not only looking at those two geographic areas, we are looking at the rest of Medford for residential

2404
03:06:45,579 --> 03:07:04,445
that our main concentration is this area, which we are, as Jim and I are also the mayoral appointees for the Greenline Extension Committee, as well, greatly concerned that these particular neighborhoods will be severely impacted by folks coming in to take the T to town eventually.

2405
03:07:05,545 --> 03:07:18,956
The business committee subcommittee is doing this excellent work, talking to businesses that have ideas and brainstorming and various suggestions on what to do about business parking.

2406
03:07:20,737 --> 03:07:27,799
They have also, we have also all created this survey that we have sent out to businesses through the Chamber of Commerce.

2407
03:07:28,279 --> 03:07:31,701
This is now publicly available on the City of Medford's website.

2408
03:07:32,321 --> 03:07:35,082
We strongly encourage all businesses to take the survey.

2409
03:07:35,142 --> 03:07:44,865
We are actively looking for feedback from every single business in the City of Medford, whether or not you are in a parking center, whether or not you have a meter in front of your business or not.

2410
03:07:45,785 --> 03:07:48,626
We do want to hear from as many businesses as possible.

2411
03:07:49,306 --> 03:07:56,953
As you can imagine, the pandemic has made it difficult to reach out, you know, meeting as many people as possible.

2412
03:07:56,973 --> 03:08:12,946
So what we're trying to do here is reach out through public forums, such as the City Council on the City of Medford's website, as well as through the Chamber and basically handing out flyers where it's safe and applicable to talk to businesses.

2413
03:08:15,136 --> 03:08:18,039
We will also be doing a residential parking survey.

2414
03:08:18,059 --> 03:08:29,690
So we do want all residents of Medford, whether you have a business or not, whether you own a house or not, we would love to hear everyone's opinions about the current parking situation in Medford and how it can be made better.

2415
03:08:30,491 --> 03:08:37,538
The link to the survey is available on the City of Medford's website, and I'll stop here if anyone has any questions for Jim or I.

2416
03:08:43,870 --> 03:08:45,251
Councilor Morrell and Councilor Marks.

2417
03:08:46,212 --> 03:08:46,973
Thank you, Mr. President.

2418
03:08:47,293 --> 03:08:51,136
Laurel, do you know where specifically on the website the link to that survey could be found?

2419
03:08:51,156 --> 03:08:55,299
Yeah, so it was just posted.

2420
03:08:55,559 --> 03:09:04,686
So it's on the city news announcements from December 4th, but the title is Mayor's Commission on Parking Policy Enforcement Seeking Business Input via Survey.

2421
03:09:05,146 --> 03:09:05,526
Okay, great.

2422
03:09:05,687 --> 03:09:05,947
Thank you.

2423
03:09:07,160 --> 03:09:08,420
Councilor Morrell, Councilor Marks.

2424
03:09:09,621 --> 03:09:10,621
Thank you, Mr. President.

2425
03:09:10,741 --> 03:09:16,503
And I want to thank the two chairs, Laurel and Jim, for their dedication to this community.

2426
03:09:17,283 --> 03:09:19,484
They've been involved with a lot of different projects.

2427
03:09:20,384 --> 03:09:23,945
And this project is a big undertaking.

2428
03:09:24,925 --> 03:09:30,767
I sat on the original parking enforcement committee back some, I don't know, probably 10 years ago now.

2429
03:09:31,427 --> 03:09:33,508
And at that time, it was a large undertaking.

2430
03:09:33,968 --> 03:09:41,790
And they're taking on, in addition, the Green Line extension and some other issues that city-wide permit parking and some other issues.

2431
03:09:42,110 --> 03:09:58,235
My question to the two chairs is, if someone's interested in a particular subject, as you know, there's a lot involved with from enforcement to districts to meters or kiosk and how we're going to enforce things.

2432
03:09:59,516 --> 03:10:03,237
If someone is just interested in one aspect,

2433
03:10:03,757 --> 03:10:06,097
How do they know when that will be brought up?

2434
03:10:06,197 --> 03:10:15,759
Are they allowed to get onto the Wednesday meetings and just bring up any subject, or is there an agenda that you follow and talk about just certain items?

2435
03:10:16,259 --> 03:10:16,979
How does that work?

2436
03:10:18,720 --> 03:10:27,281
Thanks, Councilor, because we are acting on behalf of the mayor as a city commission, we do have public meetings with public schedules posted ahead of time.

2437
03:10:28,101 --> 03:10:31,142
We offer time at the end of the meetings for any public comments.

2438
03:10:31,675 --> 03:10:35,418
So honestly, we are not progressing in a linear form.

2439
03:10:35,478 --> 03:10:38,381
We are sort of taking all issues as they come up.

2440
03:10:39,021 --> 03:10:43,385
It sounds like a massive undertaking, but we only have three months to complete our report as of now.

2441
03:10:43,485 --> 03:10:58,238
So if anyone is interested in any of those particular issues, whether it is meters or private ways, we are welcome to come in and bring it to the commission pretty much at any time.

2442
03:10:59,961 --> 03:11:09,888
So how, as a commission, are you publicizing your meetings and are they well attended over the last, you know, several weeks since you've been meeting?

2443
03:11:11,670 --> 03:11:15,753
Meetings are posted on the city website or the event calendar.

2444
03:11:15,773 --> 03:11:21,016
I would say no, probably folks don't know that we are operating it.

2445
03:11:21,036 --> 03:11:23,678
There's a lot of commissions going on in the city right now.

2446
03:11:23,738 --> 03:11:25,320
And we are,

2447
03:11:26,428 --> 03:11:39,531
just looking to pretty much get our name out there as well and really encourage folks that are interested in parking to come to the meetings and or reach out to Jim and I. We have all of the contact information also available.

2448
03:11:41,231 --> 03:11:55,875
So is the expectation at some point that you're going to have, you know, like a full-blown public hearing where residents will be invited to hear recommendations and give input?

2449
03:11:57,084 --> 03:11:58,205
Is that the ultimate?

2450
03:12:00,567 --> 03:12:01,307
It's possible.

2451
03:12:02,688 --> 03:12:05,970
You know, it's within the realm of possibility.

2452
03:12:05,990 --> 03:12:14,096
I would say right now we're very focused on getting as much information as possible for the recommendation for the mayor's report.

2453
03:12:14,176 --> 03:12:16,758
The mayor's charge was fairly specific.

2454
03:12:17,338 --> 03:12:26,625
So we also have a number of previous parking studies that have been done, as you said, 10 years ago and more recent.

2455
03:12:27,505 --> 03:12:32,790
So ideally, we would like to get to a place where we have public input as a large meeting, yes.

2456
03:12:33,711 --> 03:12:35,232
It will not probably be in the next month.

2457
03:12:36,353 --> 03:12:36,533
Right.

2458
03:12:37,094 --> 03:12:52,228
And just if I can give a word of caution, I think that's one thing that could get in the way of this whole process, is that if the public input is held, and I'm not saying this is the case, but if it's held to the end, you may get a lot of

2459
03:12:53,989 --> 03:12:57,750
animosity and people thinking they've been left out of the process.

2460
03:12:58,410 --> 03:13:03,171
And so somehow, and it's a difficult, I agree with you, there's a lot going on in the community.

2461
03:13:03,911 --> 03:13:12,312
Somehow I think it's important that public hearings be set up along this whole process and not just wait till the end.

2462
03:13:13,052 --> 03:13:21,814
And I'll leave that up to the committee, but I would highly recommend that in the interest of transparency and so forth.

2463
03:13:23,692 --> 03:13:24,352
Thank you.

2464
03:13:25,413 --> 03:13:26,413
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2465
03:13:26,714 --> 03:13:27,714
Vice President Caviello.

2466
03:13:28,775 --> 03:13:31,776
Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks, Chairman Low.

2467
03:13:32,096 --> 03:13:33,317
You guys always step up to do.

2468
03:13:34,405 --> 03:13:36,887
do these big tasks that no one else wants to volunteer for.

2469
03:13:36,927 --> 03:13:39,750
All right, thank you for your help.

2470
03:13:40,591 --> 03:13:46,356
Is there any discussion amongst your group with life after Republic Parking?

2471
03:13:46,396 --> 03:13:54,023
I know their contract is coming to the end very soon, and is there any discussions on that?

2472
03:13:58,903 --> 03:14:02,767
At this point, we have not had those kind of discussions at all.

2473
03:14:02,907 --> 03:14:14,199
Basically, we've interviewed to go over procedure process and actually the tools needed and specifically what could be identified as enhancements.

2474
03:14:14,920 --> 03:14:16,661
We're here to make recommendations.

2475
03:14:16,781 --> 03:14:20,142
So enforcement is one of these recommendations we'll be doing.

2476
03:14:20,622 --> 03:14:24,764
So we need to know what products are available to the city.

2477
03:14:25,164 --> 03:14:33,187
And so most of this has been like a data gathering situation where we're trying to define specifics of process.

2478
03:14:34,027 --> 03:14:38,969
As Republic Parking been receptive to suggestions,

2479
03:14:40,234 --> 03:14:42,735
They have been very receptive, they've been open.

2480
03:14:44,135 --> 03:14:51,658
We have a person who's administering all of these interviews, Pam Cerullo, who has done a fantastic job.

2481
03:14:52,198 --> 03:14:53,199
And they are available.

2482
03:14:53,599 --> 03:14:58,801
We have a meeting with them, and then they're available for any questions, any updates.

2483
03:14:59,321 --> 03:15:01,542
So they've been very forthcoming with information.

2484
03:15:01,982 --> 03:15:02,182
Yes.

2485
03:15:02,742 --> 03:15:09,625
So are you tackling, I would think, probably the two problem areas would be South Memphis and the Hillside area.

2486
03:15:10,109 --> 03:15:13,050
Are those your two biggest areas you're working on at the moment?

2487
03:15:14,431 --> 03:15:17,552
They are the GLX areas, quite honestly, so yes.

2488
03:15:17,732 --> 03:15:27,056
And they're some of the most densely populated areas, so parking is, resident parking and business parking, are on people's minds, so yes.

2489
03:15:28,376 --> 03:15:39,021
Is there any talk of bringing that parking back on Boston Avenue where they, along that GLX line, where they took them all those spots away, from like College Ave down to,

2490
03:15:41,243 --> 03:15:41,984
The Dunkin' Donuts?

2491
03:15:43,987 --> 03:15:52,059
We recently had a conversation with Rocco DiRico, who is also the Hillside representative for the business.

2492
03:15:53,158 --> 03:16:01,584
We're, again, asking the businesses what works, what doesn't work, et cetera, what their needs are, what their employee parking needs are.

2493
03:16:02,064 --> 03:16:04,426
All of that data information are gathering.

2494
03:16:05,426 --> 03:16:11,170
I think that's sort of a secondary aspect, looking at parking, seeing what's available, what the needs are.

2495
03:16:11,651 --> 03:16:16,574
So ultimately, I'm certain that we will come to some sort of realization of our needs.

2496
03:16:17,555 --> 03:16:17,915
Thanks, Jim.

2497
03:16:19,678 --> 03:16:32,228
To address that specific concern, obviously there's still a lot of construction happening between Tufts and the GLX, so it's on a larger roadmap to discuss.

2498
03:16:32,768 --> 03:16:36,391
We're not necessarily looking at every street.

2499
03:16:37,732 --> 03:16:45,758
My question was, you know, on Boston Avenue, where College is down, they used to be all parking along this strip that's now gone.

2500
03:16:48,216 --> 03:16:50,897
probably a public representative duty for these spots.

2501
03:16:51,657 --> 03:16:56,260
Are those spots going to be brought back after the train station comes in?

2502
03:16:57,961 --> 03:17:00,502
There's discussion about what will happen to those spots.

2503
03:17:00,642 --> 03:17:01,843
I can't say for sure.

2504
03:17:03,504 --> 03:17:04,084
It's in flux.

2505
03:17:05,665 --> 03:17:05,945
Thank you.

2506
03:17:08,616 --> 03:17:11,038
Thank you vice president.

2507
03:17:13,320 --> 03:17:18,444
We have a council of bears has a question and then we'll go on to Mari.

2508
03:17:19,485 --> 03:17:20,045
Council of bears.

2509
03:17:20,286 --> 03:17:21,166
Thank you, Mr. President.

2510
03:17:21,206 --> 03:17:22,387
Not a question, just a comment.

2511
03:17:22,407 --> 03:17:28,092
I want to thank the chairs and the members of the commission for taking on this difficult project.

2512
03:17:28,332 --> 03:17:30,874
And I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

2513
03:17:31,074 --> 03:17:31,395
Thank you.

2514
03:17:32,315 --> 03:17:32,596
Thank you.

2515
03:17:32,616 --> 03:17:33,356
Council of bears.

2516
03:17:34,197 --> 03:17:34,557
Okay.

2517
03:17:34,597 --> 03:17:36,379
We have a, let's see Mari Carroll.

2518
03:17:39,039 --> 03:17:39,780
I'm trying to unmute you.

2519
03:17:43,002 --> 03:17:43,302
There you go.

2520
03:17:43,682 --> 03:17:44,182
How's that?

2521
03:17:44,403 --> 03:17:44,863
We in?

2522
03:17:45,203 --> 03:17:45,603
Perfect.

2523
03:17:48,045 --> 03:17:48,845
Thank you, everyone.

2524
03:17:49,386 --> 03:18:02,855
I just have to tell you, I'm so delighted to be on this commission, number one, of people that just get it and they care about the city and want to do the right thing.

2525
03:18:03,735 --> 03:18:05,076
It's not going to be perfect.

2526
03:18:05,416 --> 03:18:07,157
Nothing ever is in the beginning,

2527
03:18:09,194 --> 03:18:17,817
You know, we have taken in and we're going basically door-to-door in all the, I am the chair for the business community.

2528
03:18:18,217 --> 03:18:27,341
We've been in Haines Square, we're about to go into West Mefford, Mefford Square, in the hillside, we've had all the reps out of the chamber.

2529
03:18:28,694 --> 03:18:30,095
to do the right thing here.

2530
03:18:30,555 --> 03:18:32,757
And we're going to come up with something.

2531
03:18:32,977 --> 03:18:37,320
And I'm going to tell you, you guys, everyone knows me that's sitting on that council.

2532
03:18:37,720 --> 03:18:41,503
It's not going to be perfect, but you know, we're going to retweak it to make it right.

2533
03:18:42,044 --> 03:18:44,405
You can only do the best you can.

2534
03:18:44,665 --> 03:18:54,352
And the mayor has put together a commission led by Jim Morrow that they're doing a great job.

2535
03:18:54,492 --> 03:18:57,435
And be it with us, work with us,

2536
03:18:58,462 --> 03:19:02,463
We're going to work with everybody else, and let's do the right thing here.

2537
03:19:04,204 --> 03:19:06,885
And also, I hate National Grid.

2538
03:19:07,305 --> 03:19:11,106
So four and a half years with my doorstep.

2539
03:19:11,526 --> 03:19:13,007
And get rid of that.

2540
03:19:13,307 --> 03:19:24,350
George, they show up at 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock at all your constituents' front door on Riverside Ave.

2541
03:19:24,410 --> 03:19:26,031
So tell them to get ready.

2542
03:19:28,911 --> 03:19:29,251
Thank you.

2543
03:19:29,271 --> 03:19:30,372
Keep the kind words, Mario.

2544
03:19:30,452 --> 03:19:31,913
Thank you, Mario.

2545
03:19:32,273 --> 03:19:33,674
Thanks, you guys, as always.

2546
03:19:33,714 --> 03:19:34,415
You know that.

2547
03:19:35,316 --> 03:19:35,736
Thank you.

2548
03:19:37,557 --> 03:19:39,879
Jim O'Neill, thank you for all your hard work with us.

2549
03:19:39,979 --> 03:19:41,500
And Mario, thank you for your hard work as well.

2550
03:19:42,020 --> 03:19:47,544
If someone wants to reach out to either of you individually, is there a contact or is there an email address?

2551
03:19:48,124 --> 03:19:48,524
There is.

2552
03:19:49,045 --> 03:19:51,567
It's commissionpe at gmail.com.

2553
03:19:53,704 --> 03:19:57,165
So commissionpeteredward at gmail.com PE.

2554
03:19:58,006 --> 03:20:03,968
We also have a phone number, area code 339-221-7027.

2555
03:20:03,988 --> 03:20:11,311
And again, all this contact information is also on the website.

2556
03:20:11,391 --> 03:20:18,293
Our meetings other than this week, because it is the start of Hanukkah, this week's meeting is Thursday at 3 p.m.

2557
03:20:19,274 --> 03:20:22,035
The Zoom information link is on the city's website.

2558
03:20:22,575 --> 03:20:23,155
Other than that,

2559
03:20:24,824 --> 03:20:27,787
The public meetings are held Wednesday at 7 o'clock.

2560
03:20:28,547 --> 03:20:29,488
We welcome the public.

2561
03:20:30,649 --> 03:20:37,555
And then one other piece of business is that everyone should know that the Green Line meeting is happening, and the public meeting is happening tomorrow night.

2562
03:20:38,296 --> 03:20:42,819
You can sign up to the MBTA's website to attend the meeting, but it'll be an update meeting of what's happening.

2563
03:20:42,839 --> 03:20:47,904
And Jim and I would be happy to come back before the Council and give you an update on the Green Line as well.

2564
03:20:48,473 --> 03:20:49,854
Great, thank you very much.

2565
03:20:50,755 --> 03:20:53,477
And John, everyone knows how to get a hold of me.

2566
03:20:53,497 --> 03:20:55,779
Yes, we do.

2567
03:20:55,799 --> 03:20:56,940
Thank you, Marty.

2568
03:21:00,003 --> 03:21:07,168
If I may, Jim and Laurel, I believe a while back, there was a parking study that was done.

2569
03:21:07,189 --> 03:21:12,453
I think it was when Chief Sacco was leaving and Chief Buckley was coming in.

2570
03:21:13,674 --> 03:21:14,735
Is that something that you're looking at?

2571
03:21:15,676 --> 03:21:18,518
Actually, we're using that as a baseline, one of our baselines.

2572
03:21:19,439 --> 03:21:23,682
It has specific numbers, it has specific focus, so yes, we're using that.

2573
03:21:23,722 --> 03:21:25,564
And it is available for anyone to view.

2574
03:21:26,264 --> 03:21:32,429
Any information that people want to review, just contact through the email and we'll send you a link.

2575
03:21:32,829 --> 03:21:33,189
Perfect.

2576
03:21:33,690 --> 03:21:34,130
Sounds good.

2577
03:21:34,170 --> 03:21:34,870
Thank you very much.

2578
03:21:34,930 --> 03:21:35,471
Appreciate it.

2579
03:21:36,011 --> 03:21:36,992
Thank you for all your hard work.

2580
03:21:37,773 --> 03:21:38,353
Any other questions?

2581
03:21:38,373 --> 03:21:38,673
Thank you.

2582
03:21:39,354 --> 03:21:39,654
Thank you.

2583
03:21:40,433 --> 03:21:44,876
Mr. President, just one question regarding the scope.

2584
03:21:45,716 --> 03:21:54,442
Does it include recommendations regarding taking the parking service in-house as well as removal of the kiosk?

2585
03:21:54,802 --> 03:21:57,744
Will that be things that the commission works on?

2586
03:22:00,152 --> 03:22:04,654
What we're doing is we're getting recommendations from the public through the public response.

2587
03:22:06,074 --> 03:22:09,695
What we're gathering also is cost involved in other communities.

2588
03:22:09,775 --> 03:22:11,616
We're asking specific questions.

2589
03:22:12,396 --> 03:22:25,821
So we're hopeful when we submit our recommendations, we'll also have an opportunity to have some sort of implementation process with a rough estimate of cost, et cetera, if you're to change things out.

2590
03:22:26,181 --> 03:22:27,422
And very basic, very,

2591
03:22:28,448 --> 03:22:33,971
very minimal, but at the same time, it will give the implementation folks an opportunity to focus.

2592
03:22:34,611 --> 03:22:36,892
So the answer to your question is we're looking at that.

2593
03:22:37,232 --> 03:22:42,715
We're getting the results of public input in regards to that.

2594
03:22:42,735 --> 03:22:54,280
So your ultimate recommendations will include looking at whether or not to take in-house or to look at an alternative from the kiosk.

2595
03:22:55,012 --> 03:23:06,521
I think it will be easier for folks to make that decision based on the information we're able to compile and sort of the direction of the report will sort of be telling on the decisions that need to go forward.

2596
03:23:06,941 --> 03:23:07,341
So, yes.

2597
03:23:08,162 --> 03:23:08,262
So.

2598
03:23:08,362 --> 03:23:11,364
It's a shame that everything's on the table.

2599
03:23:13,526 --> 03:23:16,468
It's a complicated, as you know, topic.

2600
03:23:16,508 --> 03:23:22,693
The current parking in Medford is street by street for parking for residents and then

2601
03:23:23,572 --> 03:23:27,455
enforcement.

2602
03:23:27,996 --> 03:23:35,621
And so, you know, the issue is, is if we want more enforcement, then we'd have to look at the entire program anyway, because we have X amount of enforcement officers.

2603
03:23:35,721 --> 03:23:39,824
So one decision then triggers many others.

2604
03:23:40,024 --> 03:23:45,108
So, yes, we are looking at what it looks like to have the current parking program, what it looks like to have the existing parking program, what it looks like to have the existing parking

2605
03:23:45,738 --> 03:23:46,559
parking across the city.

2606
03:23:46,979 --> 03:23:48,280
It looks like to have zone parking.

2607
03:23:48,300 --> 03:23:54,445
I would say probably the one option that's not on the table right now is no parking enforcement whatsoever.

2608
03:23:56,766 --> 03:23:59,028
If I could just jump in one more time.

2609
03:23:59,048 --> 03:24:00,950
Yes, please.

2610
03:24:01,030 --> 03:24:10,037
Michael, I am looking for the City Council to give us a huge bond to support this whole program.

2611
03:24:13,935 --> 03:24:15,036
How's that?

2612
03:24:15,136 --> 03:24:16,477
That sounds like a good idea.

2613
03:24:17,738 --> 03:24:18,839
Mr. President, if I could.

2614
03:24:20,628 --> 03:24:26,690
So I just want to understand, so this commission will be making recommendations from what I'm hearing sometime in March.

2615
03:24:27,530 --> 03:24:29,631
That's when the mayor asked for recommendations.

2616
03:24:30,671 --> 03:24:45,355
And then the actual implementation, has there been any discussion about once recommendations are with the mayor, has there been any discussion about implementation, which is I would assume the next phase of this?

2617
03:24:46,476 --> 03:24:47,636
Correct, there is not.

2618
03:24:47,996 --> 03:24:50,217
We are charged just to make recommendations.

2619
03:24:51,895 --> 03:24:52,916
Okay, thank you.

2620
03:24:53,336 --> 03:24:55,357
Thank you, Councilor Marks, Vice President Caviello.

2621
03:24:55,818 --> 03:24:56,858
Thank you, Mr. President.

2622
03:24:57,419 --> 03:25:01,041
I think Councilor Marks brought up something about the kiosks, whether they stay, whether they go.

2623
03:25:02,622 --> 03:25:08,246
If I recall, I think during the discussions, I think we owned them at the end of the contract.

2624
03:25:08,746 --> 03:25:13,049
So the question is, do we keep them?

2625
03:25:13,369 --> 03:25:20,074
I think President Falco and I have gone to a couple of shows there, and we asked about the lifespan of

2626
03:25:20,910 --> 03:25:23,971
Those kiosks, and they're saying they're seven to ten years.

2627
03:25:24,872 --> 03:25:26,012
And those are going to be ten years.

2628
03:25:26,072 --> 03:25:34,356
I mean, is the decision made, do we take them and throw them out, or do we spend the money to upgrade them and bring them up to speed?

2629
03:25:34,776 --> 03:25:41,799
Because those are upgradable, and let's see, we are going to own them at the end of our contract here.

2630
03:25:42,379 --> 03:25:45,321
So either we make use of them, or we figure we throw them out.

2631
03:25:46,761 --> 03:25:47,942
Thank you, Vice President Carviel.

2632
03:25:48,622 --> 03:25:49,824
Any other questions from the council?

2633
03:25:50,525 --> 03:25:51,546
Comments, questions?

2634
03:25:52,288 --> 03:25:52,448
No.

2635
03:25:53,089 --> 03:25:55,212
Any comments or questions from the public?

2636
03:25:57,435 --> 03:25:58,397
Marty, Marty.

2637
03:26:00,303 --> 03:26:06,064
And just to answer the copy of what he just asked, I think everything's on the table at this point.

2638
03:26:06,124 --> 03:26:07,405
Nothing's been decided.

2639
03:26:07,445 --> 03:26:13,406
We're just getting into operations of both the business community side and residential side.

2640
03:26:14,046 --> 03:26:23,868
All of this stuff will be coming forth with, you know, we're on a fast track to do a good job and let's just do it.

2641
03:26:24,388 --> 03:26:26,328
What we have right now doesn't work.

2642
03:26:27,949 --> 03:26:28,549
Thank you, Marty.

2643
03:26:29,403 --> 03:26:31,424
Okay, any other questions from the public?

2644
03:26:32,764 --> 03:26:36,285
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by?

2645
03:26:37,605 --> 03:26:42,367
Vice President Carvio, Clerk Hertoghez, please call the roll.

2646
03:26:42,767 --> 03:26:47,628
Sorry, is the motion to receive and place on file, Councilor Morrell?

2647
03:26:48,209 --> 03:26:50,349
Yes, okay, on the motion to receive and place on file.

2648
03:26:54,731 --> 03:26:55,831
Clerk Hertoghez, please call the roll.

2649
03:26:56,723 --> 03:26:57,303
Councilor Behrs.

2650
03:26:57,784 --> 03:26:58,004
Yes.

2651
03:26:58,344 --> 03:26:59,304
Vice president Carabiello.

2652
03:26:59,344 --> 03:26:59,564
Yes.

2653
03:27:00,165 --> 03:27:00,665
Councilor Night.

2654
03:27:01,405 --> 03:27:01,905
Councilor Marks.

2655
03:27:02,126 --> 03:27:02,386
Yes.

2656
03:27:02,646 --> 03:27:03,226
Councilor Morrell.

2657
03:27:03,426 --> 03:27:03,666
Yes.

2658
03:27:03,966 --> 03:27:04,727
Councilor Scarpelli.

2659
03:27:05,047 --> 03:27:05,327
Yes.

2660
03:27:05,567 --> 03:27:06,268
President Falco.

2661
03:27:06,328 --> 03:27:06,548
Yes.

2662
03:27:06,568 --> 03:27:08,729
7, 8, 4, 0, the negative, the motion passes.

2663
03:27:08,749 --> 03:27:11,050
Okay.

2664
03:27:11,570 --> 03:27:13,431
2, 0, dash 6, 6, 1.

2665
03:27:14,131 --> 03:27:24,336
Offered by Councilor Night, be it resolved that the Bedford City Council request a report from the DPW commissioner concerning brown water in the South Bedford area water delivery system.

2666
03:27:25,317 --> 03:27:25,837
Councilor Night.

2667
03:27:27,467 --> 03:27:28,688
Mr. President, thank you very much.

2668
03:27:28,848 --> 03:27:34,133
I don't know if it's the result of flushing or whatnot, maybe some underground utility work.

2669
03:27:34,553 --> 03:27:45,041
But for about nine to 11 days over the past two weeks or so, there's been a tremendous amount of brown water in South Medford neighborhoods.

2670
03:27:45,262 --> 03:27:55,590
Sometimes actually stretching all the way up to the back end of High Street, over by the river, near Mari's restaurant actually, up the street more or less though towards the barbershop and

2671
03:27:56,811 --> 03:27:58,775
the jewelry store, Rollins and VIP.

2672
03:27:59,417 --> 03:28:06,351
So with that being said, Mr. President, I've gotten a number of complaints stretching from Main Street.

2673
03:28:07,088 --> 03:28:08,249
all the way back to the square.

2674
03:28:08,970 --> 03:28:15,836
So I'm asking the DPW Water Department to provide us with an update as to what's going on, why there was so much brown water in the area for such an extended period of time.

2675
03:28:16,957 --> 03:28:23,403
You know, a lot of people were a little upset when they were trying to make the mashed potatoes and they ran the water and it was brown on Thanksgiving.

2676
03:28:23,483 --> 03:28:28,728
So I'm just hoping we can get some clarification and address some concerns, Mr. President, as to what's going on.

2677
03:28:28,748 --> 03:28:29,348
Okay.

2678
03:28:29,749 --> 03:28:31,450
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by- Mr. President.

2679
03:28:33,356 --> 03:28:34,997
Councilman Harkes.

2680
03:28:35,357 --> 03:28:41,581
If Council and I wouldn't mind amending it, I got a complaint recently about the top of Governor's Ave along South Border Road.

2681
03:28:42,001 --> 03:28:43,181
Same thing, brown water.

2682
03:28:43,922 --> 03:28:48,044
The fire department's been out there opening up the hydrants and releasing some of the water.

2683
03:28:48,384 --> 03:28:51,046
And then within a couple of weeks, the water's brown again.

2684
03:28:51,066 --> 03:28:52,667
They put two cups side by side.

2685
03:28:52,707 --> 03:28:56,429
And you can clearly see that there's something going on, Mr. President.

2686
03:28:57,049 --> 03:29:06,540
And so if Councilor Knight wouldn't mind adding the top of Governor's Ave along Saltwater Road, if that could be reviewed at the same time, that'd be great.

2687
03:29:06,700 --> 03:29:06,980
Excellent.

2688
03:29:07,261 --> 03:29:07,981
Great, thank you.

2689
03:29:08,482 --> 03:29:16,471
On the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Caviello, come in front of me, please come over.

2690
03:29:20,873 --> 03:29:21,433
Councilor Behrs?

2691
03:29:21,754 --> 03:29:21,994
Yes.

2692
03:29:22,274 --> 03:29:23,134
Vice President Caravaglia?

2693
03:29:23,154 --> 03:29:23,215
Yes.

2694
03:29:23,715 --> 03:29:24,215
Councilor Night?

2695
03:29:24,796 --> 03:29:25,056
Yes.

2696
03:29:25,296 --> 03:29:25,856
Councilor Marks?

2697
03:29:25,916 --> 03:29:26,296
Yes.

2698
03:29:26,457 --> 03:29:27,057
Councilor Morrell?

2699
03:29:30,099 --> 03:29:31,300
Councilor Morrell is absent from the chamber.

2700
03:29:31,320 --> 03:29:32,060
Councilor Scarpelli?

2701
03:29:32,601 --> 03:29:32,861
Yes.

2702
03:29:32,881 --> 03:29:33,901
President Fevella?

2703
03:29:34,282 --> 03:29:34,502
Yes.

2704
03:29:34,822 --> 03:29:37,163
Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

2705
03:29:37,203 --> 03:29:38,124
The motion passes.

2706
03:29:38,144 --> 03:29:41,106
2-0-662 offered by Councilor Marks.

2707
03:29:41,166 --> 03:29:47,210
Be it resolved that the Anheuser-Busch Corporation located at Riverside Avenue cut back the tree branches

2708
03:29:47,818 --> 03:29:52,362
overhanging the backyard of 84 Sydney Street in the interest of public safety.

2709
03:29:52,742 --> 03:29:53,423
Councilor Marks.

2710
03:29:54,163 --> 03:29:55,084
Thank you, Mr. President.

2711
03:29:55,104 --> 03:29:57,226
I think it was about 13 or 14 months ago.

2712
03:29:57,686 --> 03:30:07,235
This council did a committee, the whole review of the lot of land in between Budweiser and the residents on Sydney Street.

2713
03:30:08,175 --> 03:30:09,977
It was all overgrown, Mr. President.

2714
03:30:10,377 --> 03:30:17,605
The trees, we took a walk through that whole area and it was gnarly back there and very dangerous actually.

2715
03:30:18,226 --> 03:30:30,420
And due to this council and the city administration with their help, Budweiser actually, because they own the property, went back there and did actually, I have to say, a great job of cleaning up.

2716
03:30:30,820 --> 03:30:39,244
They left a lot of the mature trees along the fences of neighbors on Sydney, of which they did go out recently and cut some of them.

2717
03:30:40,245 --> 03:30:47,869
84 Sydney just contacted me and said there's a big overhanging branch of a very mature tree that's on the Anheuser Budweiser.

2718
03:30:51,691 --> 03:31:00,814
and they ask in the interest of public safety, because they're concerned with the recent windstorms, that the branches be cut back in the interest of public safety.

2719
03:31:00,854 --> 03:31:07,216
So I ask that this be sent to DPW and the city engineer's office.

2720
03:31:07,716 --> 03:31:10,557
I believe they're the ones that intervened last time on our behalf.

2721
03:31:12,218 --> 03:31:13,438
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2722
03:31:14,378 --> 03:31:17,279
Anybody, any questions or comments from the council?

2723
03:31:17,780 --> 03:31:18,140
Second.

2724
03:31:18,580 --> 03:31:19,040
Any hands up?

2725
03:31:20,490 --> 03:31:39,648
okay on the motion of councillor mark seconded by tonight Clark her to be please come over council bears yes vice president carry over council night yes council marks yes council Morrell yes councillor Scarpelli yes president Falco

2726
03:31:40,176 --> 03:31:41,337
Yes.

2727
03:31:41,417 --> 03:31:42,638
7 the affirmative, 0 the negative.

2728
03:31:42,658 --> 03:31:43,498
The motion passes.

2729
03:31:43,518 --> 03:31:46,660
20-663 offered by Councilor Behrs.

2730
03:31:46,760 --> 03:31:52,524
Whereas COVID-19 cases are spiking across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

2731
03:31:52,584 --> 03:31:57,367
Governor Baker has chosen to take no further action to protect

2732
03:31:57,830 --> 03:32:07,394
the health of residents and whereas super spreader events have seriously impacted residents of Medford, including members of our city and school staff.

2733
03:32:07,514 --> 03:32:21,720
Now, therefore be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration explore any and all options to increase COVID-19 mitigation action actions in the city of Medford and provide an update on any plans to protect

2734
03:32:22,581 --> 03:32:31,566
residents from COVID-19 community spread no later than the December 15th meeting of the Medford City Council, Council Affairs.

2735
03:32:31,946 --> 03:32:32,926
Thank you, Mr. President.

2736
03:32:33,307 --> 03:32:45,933
I was heartened today that there has now been action from Governor Baker on, he's rolled us back to phase three, step one, given the concerning statistics, concerning is an under,

2737
03:32:46,406 --> 03:32:47,648
underwhelming word to use.

2738
03:32:48,148 --> 03:32:55,537
COVID cases across the state are double what they were during the spring lockdown, both in terms of daily cases and the seven day average.

2739
03:32:55,938 --> 03:32:57,199
It's rising exponentially.

2740
03:32:57,700 --> 03:33:02,265
Two thirds, 67% of Massachusetts ICU beds are already occupied.

2741
03:33:02,946 --> 03:33:04,368
That's closer to 90 to 95% in Rhode Island.

2742
03:33:07,357 --> 03:33:11,459
Tens of thousands of cases and hundreds more, if not thousands more deaths are expected.

2743
03:33:11,979 --> 03:33:14,901
And we've had some major clusters here in Medford.

2744
03:33:15,001 --> 03:33:18,582
So yes, Governor Baker reverted to phase three, step one today.

2745
03:33:19,443 --> 03:33:23,725
But we weren't even at phase one when we had half as many cases in the spring.

2746
03:33:23,905 --> 03:33:29,027
So, you know, it really does present some serious health dangers to

2747
03:33:29,856 --> 03:33:33,879
thousands of residents and I would say thousands of residents here in Medford.

2748
03:33:35,060 --> 03:33:44,327
I would just like an update by next week at our December 15th meeting on any actions the city is able to take on mitigation.

2749
03:33:44,347 --> 03:33:48,670
I understand that it's essential that we follow the state guidelines in terms of phases.

2750
03:33:48,750 --> 03:33:55,355
We're not going to be able to address the spread of this disease alone if other communities are not doing it with us.

2751
03:33:55,535 --> 03:33:57,817
But I think there are a lot of steps that could be taken

2752
03:33:58,498 --> 03:34:02,860
like a robocall before the holidays to remind people to stay safe, to meet gathering limits.

2753
03:34:03,360 --> 03:34:10,103
You know, we've, we're basically just now starting to see the Thanksgiving spike in COVID cases across the state.

2754
03:34:10,123 --> 03:34:14,765
And we don't want to double down over the December holidays.

2755
03:34:16,025 --> 03:34:22,148
And, you know, we have months ahead and we have the winter months ahead before a vaccine gets distributed.

2756
03:34:22,168 --> 03:34:27,210
And I think the last thing we want to see is Massachusetts and quite frankly, the entire country,

2757
03:34:27,795 --> 03:34:39,004
you know, coming into the train station, having just lost more people and had more cases in the past few months than we did in our first spike and second spike earlier this year.

2758
03:34:39,785 --> 03:34:50,093
So that's really the intent, is for both written and verbal update from the administration on anything that they are doing and that, you know, any actions that they are taking.

2759
03:34:50,133 --> 03:34:55,557
And I think, to me, a big piece of that should be what guidelines and suggestions are we making to people

2760
03:34:56,816 --> 03:35:03,318
for how they should, you know, gather or not gather during the holidays.

2761
03:35:04,178 --> 03:35:04,518
Thank you.

2762
03:35:04,918 --> 03:35:05,999
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

2763
03:35:08,360 --> 03:35:09,080
Any other comments?

2764
03:35:09,400 --> 03:35:16,162
Mr. President, didn't we vote on a paper that was very similar to this, asking the mayor to appear before us and she agreed to appear before us periodically to give updates?

2765
03:35:18,763 --> 03:35:21,724
You are correct because I remember, I think it was Councilor Morrell's paper.

2766
03:35:24,769 --> 03:35:26,212
I think she said Perry.

2767
03:35:26,272 --> 03:35:28,055
I think the mayor's response is out.

2768
03:35:28,135 --> 03:35:28,956
It was periodically.

2769
03:35:29,597 --> 03:35:31,060
I don't think it came out monthly.

2770
03:35:31,080 --> 03:35:32,081
It came out periodically.

2771
03:35:33,063 --> 03:35:38,071
But it's my understanding that the statistics data and the like are all compiled on

2772
03:35:38,913 --> 03:35:42,456
Wednesdays, and they have their powwows on Wednesdays relative to this stuff.

2773
03:35:42,476 --> 03:35:48,041
So we'd be getting the week before's information if we did that on a Tuesday night.

2774
03:35:48,842 --> 03:35:53,526
But whatever direction we go when we go, and Mr. President, I just again request that we get this in writing.

2775
03:35:54,206 --> 03:35:57,589
I feel like our meetings are turning into more like television shows and less like meetings.

2776
03:35:58,190 --> 03:35:58,790
No, no, no.

2777
03:35:58,890 --> 03:35:59,851
I understand and I agree.

2778
03:35:59,871 --> 03:36:01,372
I mean, we should have something in writing.

2779
03:36:02,373 --> 03:36:03,154
We definitely do.

2780
03:36:05,870 --> 03:36:07,770
you know, some sort of an update from the administration.

2781
03:36:07,810 --> 03:36:08,751
We haven't received one.

2782
03:36:08,811 --> 03:36:12,071
What was it, Councilor Morrell, if you don't mind, do you know the last time we actually received?

2783
03:36:13,372 --> 03:36:14,652
I think we got it in October.

2784
03:36:14,692 --> 03:36:15,872
We didn't get it in November.

2785
03:36:16,152 --> 03:36:20,973
And then we're in December now, I believe, because I believe that the second month was missed.

2786
03:36:21,913 --> 03:36:26,594
I think also it was, you know, cases were still at least on the lower end.

2787
03:36:27,254 --> 03:36:29,675
So I think needing the update now is more dire.

2788
03:36:33,056 --> 03:36:33,416
Thank you.

2789
03:36:33,616 --> 03:36:33,836
Yes.

2790
03:36:33,916 --> 03:36:34,156
And I,

2791
03:36:35,738 --> 03:36:44,802
I miss, I did not include it in here, but a written and verbal update is the language I used in my next resolution, but I would like that for this resolution as well.

2792
03:36:44,842 --> 03:36:48,203
And I agree with councilor Knight for any update that this council receives.

2793
03:36:49,624 --> 03:36:50,004
Thank you.

2794
03:36:50,104 --> 03:36:56,907
And if actually, you know, if I could actually vice president, if you wouldn't mind coming up, I just have a couple, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to have met here.

2795
03:37:11,702 --> 03:37:14,244
Thank you for bringing this forward, because I think it is very important.

2796
03:37:14,264 --> 03:37:19,628
And I think Councilor Morrell, thank you for bringing our resolution forward a few months ago.

2797
03:37:19,788 --> 03:37:24,311
And I think it's important that we receive periodic updates.

2798
03:37:24,911 --> 03:37:29,074
Actually, they should be monthly updates, but we should be notified on a regular basis.

2799
03:37:29,094 --> 03:37:39,902
Because I know I'm getting all kinds of questions with regard to, I think some of the data, general questions as to, and I think a lot of it is education with regard to,

2800
03:37:42,043 --> 03:37:49,805
You know, I got a lot of questions about, you know, what is the threshold for notifying the community about potential exposure?

2801
03:37:49,925 --> 03:37:53,426
So if there are, you know, how is a cluster determined?

2802
03:37:53,466 --> 03:38:00,188
You know, if a cluster is determined, you know, is there ability to contact trace or whatnot?

2803
03:38:00,228 --> 03:38:04,930
So if we could, if you wouldn't mind, if we, if Councilor Beers, if we could, if I could amend that to,

2804
03:38:06,490 --> 03:38:14,774
for the administration of the Board of Health to respond as to what is the threshold for notifying the community about potential exposure?

2805
03:38:14,794 --> 03:38:17,795
And how is a cluster determined?

2806
03:38:19,516 --> 03:38:26,979
And if there is a cluster in the community, especially in the business community, what types of organizations are subject to public notification?

2807
03:38:28,213 --> 03:38:28,953
Is it restaurants?

2808
03:38:29,313 --> 03:38:30,034
Is it retail?

2809
03:38:30,634 --> 03:38:31,774
Is it healthcare providers?

2810
03:38:32,815 --> 03:38:33,815
How do they define that?

2811
03:38:33,935 --> 03:38:40,298
I've been getting a lot of questions about that type of thing, questions like that.

2812
03:38:46,060 --> 03:38:50,822
How does a communication work between the Board of Health and businesses?

2813
03:38:51,992 --> 03:38:56,896
Are the businesses given information from the Board of Health as to what is expected?

2814
03:38:57,596 --> 03:38:58,777
How is this communicated?

2815
03:38:58,797 --> 03:39:03,401
Are businesses getting information via email?

2816
03:39:03,881 --> 03:39:05,923
Is it a periodic email from the Board of Health?

2817
03:39:08,084 --> 03:39:09,966
We need to know how that's being communicated.

2818
03:39:09,986 --> 03:39:19,433
I'm sure it's being communicated, or I hope it's being communicated, but we need a clear indication of exactly how it's being communicated to the business community.

2819
03:39:22,688 --> 03:39:27,776
And last but not least, I know there was an event this weekend at the Chevalier Theater.

2820
03:39:28,597 --> 03:39:32,483
And I think they had about 250 people at the theater.

2821
03:39:33,304 --> 03:39:37,911
And my question I guess is, did the Board of Health approve that event?

2822
03:39:39,257 --> 03:39:43,402
I'm not sure how that works, but I think that we need to get answers on that.

2823
03:39:43,962 --> 03:39:45,044
Did they approve the event?

2824
03:39:45,804 --> 03:39:49,468
And it sounds like towards the end of the event, it was modified.

2825
03:39:49,749 --> 03:39:56,717
So it became, I think the person that was performing was supposed to be singing in public, on the stage.

2826
03:39:57,497 --> 03:40:05,703
And Councilor, Vice President Caviello, you might be able to explain this further, but I think that last minute- They had them perform in the green room.

2827
03:40:05,723 --> 03:40:13,869
They were operating about at 10% capacity, and they had all the safety protocols in advance.

2828
03:40:13,929 --> 03:40:21,715
And I think at the last minute, either the Board of Health or the Department of Health stepped in and made them change to

2829
03:40:23,253 --> 03:40:27,355
I think the band was on stage, but the actual performer performed in another room.

2830
03:40:27,935 --> 03:40:35,359
So he was on like a screen in front of the 250 people that were in the auditorium.

2831
03:40:35,399 --> 03:40:40,602
So I don't know if that was either through our Board of Health or the Department of Health made that recommendation, I can't-.

2832
03:40:40,782 --> 03:40:42,943
And that's a clarification I'd like to receive.

2833
03:40:43,223 --> 03:40:49,366
I think if I could amend the paper further to find out who approved the event originally and

2834
03:40:50,706 --> 03:40:53,968
Who requested the modifications to the event?

2835
03:40:54,548 --> 03:41:05,574
I mean, from what I could tell from the research I did, I think the tickets went on sale in October, and the event was, I believe it was December 4th, I think this past Saturday.

2836
03:41:05,834 --> 03:41:08,076
And it sounded like- I think it was three or four shows.

2837
03:41:08,436 --> 03:41:09,336
Okay.

2838
03:41:09,376 --> 03:41:11,298
And the event changed, I think, right beforehand.

2839
03:41:11,358 --> 03:41:15,000
So if we could get some clarification on that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

2840
03:41:15,480 --> 03:41:18,802
I thank Councilor Beast for bringing this forward and move approval.

2841
03:41:20,028 --> 03:41:32,279
Mr. President, if I may, and I support all of those amendments, and that was actually kind of more my intent with this next resolution, but I'm happy to have an amendment on this resolution wherever it needs to be.

2842
03:41:33,320 --> 03:41:35,022
What does enforcement mean?

2843
03:41:35,723 --> 03:41:42,449
That's really the question I have here, you know, and it's, I'm going to talk more about it on the next item, but there's just rumors and

2844
03:41:43,857 --> 03:41:49,801
and I think we've all seen some of the less factual ones that seem to have been out there recently.

2845
03:41:51,682 --> 03:41:53,183
We need clarity.

2846
03:41:53,643 --> 03:41:54,664
What does enforcement mean?

2847
03:41:54,724 --> 03:41:56,125
How is that being communicated?

2848
03:41:56,445 --> 03:42:01,528
And is it being administered equitably across everyone in the community?

2849
03:42:01,628 --> 03:42:09,093
So I support Councilor Falco's amendments, and that's my intent with both this resolution and the next resolution.

2850
03:42:09,253 --> 03:42:09,633
Thank you.

2851
03:42:11,575 --> 03:42:11,955
Any questions?

2852
03:42:14,022 --> 03:42:17,623
On the motion by Councilor Behrs, as amended by Councilor Falco.

2853
03:42:19,904 --> 03:42:20,604
Seconded by?

2854
03:42:21,165 --> 03:42:21,505
Second.

2855
03:42:22,005 --> 03:42:23,225
Seconded by Councilor Mox.

2856
03:42:27,507 --> 03:42:28,407
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2857
03:42:29,607 --> 03:42:30,208
Councilor Behrs?

2858
03:42:31,128 --> 03:42:31,408
Yes.

2859
03:42:31,668 --> 03:42:33,269
Vice President Kerrio, actually you gotta go last.

2860
03:42:33,889 --> 03:42:34,469
Councilor Knight?

2861
03:42:35,089 --> 03:42:35,369
Yes.

2862
03:42:35,570 --> 03:42:36,050
Thank you.

2863
03:42:36,510 --> 03:42:37,130
Councilor Marks?

2864
03:42:37,350 --> 03:42:37,710
Yes.

2865
03:42:38,190 --> 03:42:38,771
Councilor Morrell?

2866
03:42:39,351 --> 03:42:39,571
Yes.

2867
03:42:39,851 --> 03:42:40,591
Councilor Scarpelli?

2868
03:42:40,611 --> 03:42:40,711
Yes.

2869
03:42:41,532 --> 03:42:42,232
President Falco?

2870
03:42:43,552 --> 03:42:46,193
because you got to- Vice President Kerrio?

2871
03:42:46,213 --> 03:42:46,853
There we go.

2872
03:42:46,873 --> 03:42:47,753
7th affirmative.

2873
03:42:49,394 --> 03:42:50,214
Motion passes.

2874
03:42:54,876 --> 03:43:01,098
While I'm on the council floor, it would be okay to suspend the rules and take a few resolutions out of order.

2875
03:43:01,258 --> 03:43:01,458
Yes.

2876
03:43:02,779 --> 03:43:05,380
On the motion by Councilor Falcone to suspend the rules.

2877
03:43:05,980 --> 03:43:07,680
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

2878
03:43:08,120 --> 03:43:09,141
The clerk, please call the roll.

2879
03:43:12,824 --> 03:43:13,545
Councilor Behrs?

2880
03:43:13,645 --> 03:43:13,905
No.

2881
03:43:16,647 --> 03:43:18,048
OK.

2882
03:43:20,130 --> 03:43:20,791
Councilor Knight?

2883
03:43:21,491 --> 03:43:23,633
What's this, a motion to table the rest of the agenda?

2884
03:43:23,913 --> 03:43:24,854
Absolutely not.

2885
03:43:24,874 --> 03:43:25,915
It's to suspend the rules.

2886
03:43:25,935 --> 03:43:36,664
While President Falcone is on the floor, on the podium, he has two resolutions on hand.

2887
03:43:36,684 --> 03:43:38,225
You know he's on the floor.

2888
03:43:38,305 --> 03:43:38,405
No.

2889
03:43:45,217 --> 03:43:45,497
I'm not.

2890
03:43:45,597 --> 03:43:45,998
All right.

2891
03:43:46,538 --> 03:43:47,119
Councilor Marks.

2892
03:43:47,339 --> 03:43:47,719
Yes.

2893
03:43:49,721 --> 03:43:50,381
Councilor Morrell.

2894
03:43:50,562 --> 03:43:50,802
Yes.

2895
03:43:52,163 --> 03:43:52,964
Councilor Scarpelli.

2896
03:43:53,104 --> 03:43:53,364
Yes.

2897
03:43:53,604 --> 03:43:54,445
President Falco.

2898
03:43:54,865 --> 03:43:55,166
Yes.

2899
03:43:55,206 --> 03:43:55,926
Vice President Caraballo.

2900
03:43:55,946 --> 03:43:56,126
Yes.

2901
03:43:57,888 --> 03:43:59,389
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

2902
03:43:59,429 --> 03:44:00,030
Motion passes.

2903
03:44:02,215 --> 03:44:02,636
2-0-668.

2904
03:44:02,656 --> 03:44:15,351
2-0-668 offered by President Falco to be resolved that the DPW install mock parking spaces on Governor's Avenue from the intersection of Governor's Ave to High Street, the Terrace Road in the interest of public safety.

2905
03:44:15,551 --> 03:44:16,292
President Falco.

2906
03:44:16,772 --> 03:44:18,634
Thank you, President Caviello.

2907
03:44:19,275 --> 03:44:20,877
I've received a number of calls from

2908
03:44:21,838 --> 03:44:35,353
business owners down in Bedford Square regarding the parking on Governor's Ave and how it's become quite dangerous throughout the day and cars just kind of parking anywhere.

2909
03:44:37,796 --> 03:44:52,448
Just in the interest of public safety, if we could have marked spots, parking spaces on Governor's Ave from the bottom of Governor's Ave and High Street up to Terrace Road in the interest of public safety.

2910
03:44:52,548 --> 03:44:58,393
And if this could be forwarded to the Traffic Commission for their approval as well.

2911
03:44:59,134 --> 03:44:59,634
Move approval.

2912
03:45:00,455 --> 03:45:02,457
Councilor Knight.

2913
03:45:02,577 --> 03:45:06,240
Are these parking spots right now, are they business only, Mr. President?

2914
03:45:07,130 --> 03:45:08,311
I think just regular parking.

2915
03:45:08,391 --> 03:45:09,151
Just regular parking?

2916
03:45:09,171 --> 03:45:10,091
I don't even think they're marked.

2917
03:45:10,111 --> 03:45:11,972
They're not marked.

2918
03:45:12,032 --> 03:45:12,633
It's just wide open.

2919
03:45:12,673 --> 03:45:17,695
There's one, I believe, handicapped spot in front of Zero Governors Ave.

2920
03:45:18,935 --> 03:45:20,456
Two the most, but I know there's at least one.

2921
03:45:21,817 --> 03:45:26,659
Is it the sponsor's intention to reserve these spaces just for business permits?

2922
03:45:26,679 --> 03:45:26,859
No.

2923
03:45:26,899 --> 03:45:29,460
It's basically just, for me, it's just public safety.

2924
03:45:29,500 --> 03:45:32,081
It's just, from what I'm hearing, it's just out of control.

2925
03:45:32,101 --> 03:45:33,782
People can't park, so they need lines?

2926
03:45:34,752 --> 03:45:37,333
Yeah, so cars have specific spots.

2927
03:45:37,413 --> 03:45:40,173
Right now it just seems like it's a free for all.

2928
03:45:40,533 --> 03:45:42,094
Yes, Mr. President, I vote in favor of this.

2929
03:45:42,434 --> 03:45:43,974
Thank you very much for your support.

2930
03:45:44,934 --> 03:45:47,595
The motion of President Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2931
03:45:47,775 --> 03:45:48,955
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2932
03:45:50,556 --> 03:45:51,136
Councilor Behrs?

2933
03:45:51,176 --> 03:45:51,436
Yes.

2934
03:45:52,316 --> 03:45:52,836
Councilor Knight?

2935
03:45:52,876 --> 03:45:53,136
Yes.

2936
03:45:53,356 --> 03:45:53,916
Councilor Marks?

2937
03:45:55,097 --> 03:45:56,057
Councilor Marks is absent.

2938
03:45:56,597 --> 03:45:57,177
Councilor Morrell?

2939
03:45:57,457 --> 03:45:57,677
Yes.

2940
03:45:58,317 --> 03:45:59,077
Councilor Scarpelli?

2941
03:45:59,097 --> 03:45:59,357
Yes.

2942
03:45:59,618 --> 03:46:00,338
President Falco?

2943
03:46:00,358 --> 03:46:00,578
Yes.

2944
03:46:00,778 --> 03:46:01,538
Vice President Caravaglia?

2945
03:46:01,578 --> 03:46:01,638
Yes.

2946
03:46:02,742 --> 03:46:06,443
Six in affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

2947
03:46:06,463 --> 03:46:16,946
20669 offered by President Falco, be it resolved that the DPW remove the trash in between the address of 205 and 243 Felsway West in the interest of public safety.

2948
03:46:17,006 --> 03:46:17,906
President Falco.

2949
03:46:18,026 --> 03:46:19,206
Thank you, President Caviello.

2950
03:46:19,226 --> 03:46:26,208
During my walk, I noticed there was a lot of trash in between the addresses.

2951
03:46:28,523 --> 03:46:34,385
there's a few wooded lots on the Felsway and it was everything from mattresses to computer parts.

2952
03:46:35,025 --> 03:46:36,705
And thank you to the DPW.

2953
03:46:36,925 --> 03:46:43,868
I think they removed almost all of it, but I walked by the other day and I think there's like a small like box spring that's still there.

2954
03:46:44,328 --> 03:46:47,008
So if that could, if that could be removed.

2955
03:46:49,667 --> 03:46:50,528
as soon as possible.

2956
03:46:51,268 --> 03:46:52,589
I greatly appreciate it.

2957
03:46:52,709 --> 03:46:55,271
It just, it really makes the area look really rundown.

2958
03:46:55,791 --> 03:47:01,594
So if we could just kind of keep that clean and if the DPW could attend to that as soon as possible, greatly appreciate it.

2959
03:47:01,714 --> 03:47:02,675
Thank you.

2960
03:47:03,596 --> 03:47:04,616
Thank you, Mr. President.

2961
03:47:04,736 --> 03:47:09,259
I took the liberty of looking at the property database and all of those lots are privately owned.

2962
03:47:09,339 --> 03:47:12,901
None of them are owned by the city of Medford or state agencies.

2963
03:47:13,742 --> 03:47:18,685
So I'd like to make an amendment if acceptable that DPW at least explore

2964
03:47:20,771 --> 03:47:24,752
I don't know what our options are here, but yeah, well, yeah, there you go.

2965
03:47:25,053 --> 03:47:26,813
That's the, that's the phrase I was looking for.

2966
03:47:27,854 --> 03:47:34,597
Explore the liens on, on their tax bills to address the condition of the property and the fact that the city had to come in and clean it up.

2967
03:47:34,797 --> 03:47:35,117
Thank you.

2968
03:47:37,058 --> 03:47:38,639
Approval is amended.

2969
03:47:39,279 --> 03:47:43,441
The motion by President Falco is amended by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2970
03:47:44,681 --> 03:47:45,602
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2971
03:47:47,383 --> 03:47:47,863

2972
03:47:48,767 --> 03:47:48,987
Yes.

2973
03:47:49,607 --> 03:47:50,108
Councilor Knight?

2974
03:47:50,648 --> 03:47:50,908
Yes.

2975
03:47:51,288 --> 03:47:51,769
Councilor Marks?

2976
03:47:51,789 --> 03:47:51,869
Yes.

2977
03:47:52,249 --> 03:47:53,409
Councilor Morrell?

2978
03:47:53,649 --> 03:47:53,910
Yes.

2979
03:47:54,730 --> 03:47:55,210
Councilor Scarpelli?

2980
03:47:55,370 --> 03:47:55,630
Yes.

2981
03:47:55,991 --> 03:47:57,011
President Falcone?

2982
03:47:58,392 --> 03:47:58,632
Yes.

2983
03:47:58,692 --> 03:47:59,172
Vice President Ferriero?

2984
03:47:59,192 --> 03:47:59,252
Yes.

2985
03:47:59,272 --> 03:47:59,773
Seven in the affirmative.

2986
03:47:59,793 --> 03:48:00,393
Motion passes.

2987
03:48:00,713 --> 03:48:01,834
We're under suspension, Mr. President.

2988
03:48:01,854 --> 03:48:02,214
The records?

2989
03:48:11,335 --> 03:48:13,216
Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

2990
03:48:13,476 --> 03:48:18,960
Motion to revert to the regular order of business by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2991
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:20,321
Clerk Hurnaby, please call the roll.

2992
03:48:26,304 --> 03:48:26,925
Councilor Behrs.

2993
03:48:27,105 --> 03:48:27,365
Yes.

2994
03:48:28,106 --> 03:48:28,946
Vice President Kerrio.

2995
03:48:29,046 --> 03:48:29,286
Yes.

2996
03:48:29,567 --> 03:48:30,047
Councilor Knight.

2997
03:48:31,238 --> 03:48:31,758
Councilor Marks?

2998
03:48:31,938 --> 03:48:32,178
Yes.

2999
03:48:32,378 --> 03:48:32,979
Councilor Morrell?

3000
03:48:33,159 --> 03:48:33,499
Yes.

3001
03:48:33,639 --> 03:48:34,339
Councilor Scarpelli?

3002
03:48:34,379 --> 03:48:34,459
Yes.

3003
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:35,680
President Falco?

3004
03:48:35,720 --> 03:48:35,920
Yes.

3005
03:48:35,980 --> 03:48:37,521
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

3006
03:48:37,541 --> 03:48:38,361
The motion passes.

3007
03:48:38,381 --> 03:48:47,665
20-664 offered by Council of Mayors be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration provide a written and verbal update

3008
03:48:48,525 --> 03:49:00,394
to the Memphis City Council no later than the December 15th meeting of the Memphis City Council regarding enforcement of the COVID-19 health and safety rules and regulations at local businesses or large private residential gatherings.

3009
03:49:00,574 --> 03:49:10,262
And generally the city will pursue civil or criminal investigations of alleged violations of COVID-19 health and safety rules and regulations.

3010
03:49:11,042 --> 03:49:11,823
Councilor Baird.

3011
03:49:12,143 --> 03:49:13,064
Thank you, Mr. President.

3012
03:49:13,144 --> 03:49:15,366
Very similar to the discussion we were just having.

3013
03:49:15,386 --> 03:49:17,187
I think it's really important.

3014
03:49:18,169 --> 03:49:25,332
especially given the surge in cases and as we've seen rumors flying about across the city about various clusters.

3015
03:49:26,852 --> 03:49:29,213
What is the city's policy around enforcement?

3016
03:49:29,833 --> 03:49:31,854
How is it being enforced?

3017
03:49:31,974 --> 03:49:36,536
And I'm not encouraging or discouraging any specific type of enforcement.

3018
03:49:36,556 --> 03:49:43,058
I just think it's very important that residents know what the city is doing around health and safety rules and regulations.

3019
03:49:43,198 --> 03:49:47,320
I think the most important thing is that we're helping people to understand the rules and regulations

3020
03:49:47,850 --> 03:49:51,172
and how they can be followed before any violations occur.

3021
03:49:51,632 --> 03:50:08,861
But obviously, if messages are going out with organizations being named or people being named, I think it's important that that policy is a blanket policy and applies equitably to any situation or any case where such a communication is deemed necessary.

3022
03:50:09,461 --> 03:50:12,803
And I'd also like to know if there's anything ongoing.

3023
03:50:13,443 --> 03:50:16,725
I know that the word investigations has been thrown around a little bit recently.

3024
03:50:18,579 --> 03:50:19,720
That's the motion.

3025
03:50:20,601 --> 03:50:21,442
Thank you, Mr. President.

3026
03:50:22,704 --> 03:50:25,487
I'd like to offer a B paper, Mr. President, on this.

3027
03:50:25,987 --> 03:50:29,691
I mean, it builds right upon what Councilor Baez is talking about.

3028
03:50:29,772 --> 03:50:33,616
It's the narrative and the spin that's put on certain issues.

3029
03:50:33,896 --> 03:50:38,722
I'm offering a B paper asking what the criteria is for a robocall.

3030
03:50:42,082 --> 03:50:46,865
Over this past week, we all got robocalls concerning certain business establishments in this community.

3031
03:50:48,345 --> 03:50:51,066
That was the only robocall I ever got about a business establishment.

3032
03:50:51,427 --> 03:50:57,950
I've never heard about any other establishments ever in this community that have ever had any type of outbreak or any type of contract tracing.

3033
03:50:58,970 --> 03:51:04,773
So it's very concerning to me, Mr. President, especially based upon the current circumstances in the economy.

3034
03:51:05,993 --> 03:51:09,616
where one out of five is unemployed, where we're seeing a lot of small businesses closing.

3035
03:51:10,277 --> 03:51:15,701
I think sometimes taking a deep breath and thinking a little bit before speaking makes a lot of sense.

3036
03:51:16,181 --> 03:51:19,544
I know I'm certainly guilty of not doing that a lot of the time.

3037
03:51:19,964 --> 03:51:24,268
But ultimately, I'd like to know what the criteria that's being used is for a robocall.

3038
03:51:25,114 --> 03:51:27,775
notification to the community relative to COVID clusters.

3039
03:51:27,915 --> 03:51:30,096
Is there a policy or a protocol?

3040
03:51:30,156 --> 03:51:34,058
Is it just, you know, when I feel like doing it, I'm going to do it or what?

3041
03:51:34,138 --> 03:51:46,184
I mean, because I think that, you know, every action has a reaction and the reaction that the community has can be very damaging to small businesses if our ducks aren't in a row and our facts are not accurate.

3042
03:51:49,125 --> 03:51:49,565
Thank you.

3043
03:51:49,705 --> 03:51:50,346
Councilor Knight.

3044
03:51:52,006 --> 03:51:53,287
Any questions from the council?

3045
03:51:54,788 --> 03:51:59,850
Concerns, any comments, anything online?

3046
03:52:00,691 --> 03:52:00,851
No.

3047
03:52:01,491 --> 03:52:05,033
So we'll take the B paper first, offered by Councilor Knight on the B paper.

3048
03:52:06,113 --> 03:52:07,594
Offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

3049
03:52:09,114 --> 03:52:11,135
Councilor Scott Kelly, Clerk Herterby, please call the roll.

3050
03:52:13,436 --> 03:52:13,957
Councilor Behrs?

3051
03:52:14,497 --> 03:52:14,697
Yes.

3052
03:52:15,237 --> 03:52:16,098
Vice President Kerrio?

3053
03:52:16,278 --> 03:52:16,478
Yes.

3054
03:52:16,818 --> 03:52:17,258
Councilor Knight?

3055
03:52:17,298 --> 03:52:17,558
Yes.

3056
03:52:18,258 --> 03:52:18,799
Councilor Marks?

3057
03:52:19,199 --> 03:52:19,319
Yes.

3058
03:52:19,726 --> 03:52:20,326
Councilor Morrell.

3059
03:52:20,526 --> 03:52:20,786
Yes.

3060
03:52:21,247 --> 03:52:22,007
Councilor Scarpelli.

3061
03:52:22,247 --> 03:52:22,447
Yes.

3062
03:52:22,587 --> 03:52:23,287
President Falco.

3063
03:52:23,327 --> 03:52:23,508
Yes.

3064
03:52:23,548 --> 03:52:24,888
Seven affirmative, zero negative.

3065
03:52:24,908 --> 03:52:26,349
The motion passes.

3066
03:52:27,629 --> 03:52:37,353
Unmanned motion offered by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

3067
03:52:39,114 --> 03:52:39,674
Councilor Behrs.

3068
03:52:39,814 --> 03:52:40,014
Yes.

3069
03:52:40,314 --> 03:52:41,195
Vice President Caravaglio.

3070
03:52:41,235 --> 03:52:41,395
Yes.

3071
03:52:41,935 --> 03:52:42,455
Councilor Knight.

3072
03:52:42,515 --> 03:52:42,815
Yes.

3073
03:52:43,196 --> 03:52:43,756
Councilor Marks.

3074
03:52:43,776 --> 03:52:44,276
Yes.

3075
03:52:44,650 --> 03:52:45,291
Councilor Morrell?

3076
03:52:45,491 --> 03:52:45,731
Yes.

3077
03:52:46,232 --> 03:52:46,913
Councilor Scarpelli?

3078
03:52:46,933 --> 03:52:47,033
Yes.

3079
03:52:47,454 --> 03:52:48,154
President Fevella?

3080
03:52:48,194 --> 03:52:48,415
Yes.

3081
03:52:48,495 --> 03:52:50,337
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

3082
03:52:50,377 --> 03:52:51,298
The motion passes.

3083
03:52:51,318 --> 03:52:59,909
20-666 offered by Councilor Beers and Councilor Morrell be resolved at the Memphis City, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council.

3084
03:52:59,949 --> 03:53:01,892
You skipped 665, Mr. President.

3085
03:53:03,573 --> 03:53:03,953
Very good.

3086
03:53:03,993 --> 03:53:04,614
Thank you.

3087
03:53:04,794 --> 03:53:09,956
If we're putting me at the end, I'm sorry.

3088
03:53:09,996 --> 03:53:13,638
The note, um, two zero dash six, six, five offered by council appears.

3089
03:53:13,738 --> 03:53:21,361
Whereas nearly 2000 Method residents have tested positive for COVID-19 in hundreds of sadly died due to the disease.

3090
03:53:21,901 --> 03:53:27,784
Now, therefore be it resolved by the method city council council that the city administration established a commission

3091
03:53:28,667 --> 03:53:46,289
for the construction of a COVID-19 memorial in the city of Medford, be it further resolved that the commission, that this commission can begin to meet after the conclusion of the COVID-19 state of emergency, but may meet earlier at the discretion of the city administration.

3092
03:53:46,389 --> 03:53:47,150
Councilor Behrs.

3093
03:53:47,733 --> 03:53:48,774
Thank you, Mr. President.

3094
03:53:49,354 --> 03:54:00,682
I think one of the greatest tragedies of this pandemic is that we haven't been able to mourn people that we've lost either to COVID-19 or to other, you know, causes of death during this pandemic.

3095
03:54:01,342 --> 03:54:16,453
And from what we know from past incidents like this, and there's actually been very little that's happened as quickly as this has, the COVID-19 death rate is faster on a daily basis than any war in the history of the United States.

3096
03:54:17,652 --> 03:54:25,337
The Civil War is an example of a very similar lack of being able to mourn, and it impacted people's lives for a very long time.

3097
03:54:26,257 --> 03:54:39,665
So the intent here is that we would have a memorial of some kind to the pandemic, to the people who we've lost, and also to people, I think, who may suffer the rest of their lives due to the disease.

3098
03:54:40,986 --> 03:54:43,767
But I don't want to, say, put any timelines on that.

3099
03:54:43,848 --> 03:54:44,508
I was hoping

3100
03:54:45,307 --> 03:54:54,533
that we would be discussing this, you know, maybe closer to being on a path to vaccination and on the other side of this pandemic.

3101
03:54:55,554 --> 03:54:59,917
But I, you know, I put it forward as the idea has been discussed and come up.

3102
03:54:59,957 --> 03:55:14,287
And I think it's just important that we acknowledge that it's something that we want to do as a community to acknowledge and give ourselves some space to mourn this collective tragedy once the pandemic restrictions are lifted.

3103
03:55:14,627 --> 03:55:14,927
Thank you.

3104
03:55:15,837 --> 03:55:16,897
Thank you, Councilor Peers.

3105
03:55:16,917 --> 03:55:22,779
I don't want to remember this, I want to forget it.

3106
03:55:22,859 --> 03:55:24,500
Would any Councilors like to speak on this?

3107
03:55:27,081 --> 03:55:27,481
Okay.

3108
03:55:28,762 --> 03:55:29,382
Anyone here?

3109
03:55:29,402 --> 03:55:30,582
No one has a hand up.

3110
03:55:31,202 --> 03:55:31,622
Okay.

3111
03:55:34,003 --> 03:55:36,124
On the motion of Councilor Peers, seconded by?

3112
03:55:38,425 --> 03:55:39,145
Councilor Morrell.

3113
03:55:40,225 --> 03:55:41,466
Clerk Carter please call the roll.

3114
03:55:44,608 --> 03:55:45,128
Councilor Behrs?

3115
03:55:45,148 --> 03:55:46,648
I'm sorry, yes.

3116
03:55:47,229 --> 03:55:48,029
Vice President Caravaglia?

3117
03:55:48,049 --> 03:55:48,169
No.

3118
03:55:49,329 --> 03:55:49,829
Councilor Knight?

3119
03:55:49,969 --> 03:55:50,149
No.

3120
03:55:53,470 --> 03:55:54,050
Councilor Marks?

3121
03:55:54,230 --> 03:55:54,410
No.

3122
03:56:02,592 --> 03:56:03,152
Councilor Morrell?

3123
03:56:03,412 --> 03:56:03,612
Yes.

3124
03:56:05,393 --> 03:56:06,113
Councilor Scarpelli?

3125
03:56:06,573 --> 03:56:06,793
No.

3126
03:56:09,854 --> 03:56:10,434
President Falco?

3127
03:56:15,132 --> 03:56:15,432
Four, three.

3128
03:56:16,213 --> 03:56:17,875
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

3129
03:56:17,915 --> 03:56:19,716
The motion passes.

3130
03:56:19,977 --> 03:56:22,019
20666 offered by Councilor Beers and Councilor Morrell.

3131
03:56:22,579 --> 03:56:38,975
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the Board of Health and Office of Energy and Environment establish a policy that restaurants and other eating establishments only provide plastic utensils, straws, and stirrers upon request of the customer.

3132
03:56:39,759 --> 03:56:41,141
Councilor Beres.

3133
03:56:42,703 --> 03:56:45,007
I would be happy to defer to Councilor Morrell.

3134
03:56:46,268 --> 03:56:46,949
Councilor Morrell.

3135
03:56:47,755 --> 03:56:48,455
Thank you, Mr. President.

3136
03:56:48,495 --> 03:56:50,297
I know it's 11 p.m.

3137
03:56:50,337 --> 03:56:58,882
on the dot and you guys don't want to hear me talk about plastics, forks and knives right now, but I agree with Councilor Behrs that this is important.

3138
03:56:59,683 --> 03:57:08,588
The pandemic will recede, but the amount of single use and disposable items that has vastly increased because of the pandemic will not be gone anytime soon.

3139
03:57:09,229 --> 03:57:13,772
We can't avoid the use of PPE, but there are things like plastic utensils that

3140
03:57:14,552 --> 03:57:16,893
They take about a thousand years to break down if they ever do.

3141
03:57:17,574 --> 03:57:24,917
And I know many of us come home with plastic utensils from the takeout of restaurants in the area that we're trying to support that we simply don't need.

3142
03:57:24,977 --> 03:57:25,958
We have utensils at home.

3143
03:57:26,058 --> 03:57:40,244
So I think it's just a common sense resolution that just to minimize the amount of these that go out in takeaway bags that people may never use and just put in their drawers at home and eventually throw away and they end up in a landfill and never break down.

3144
03:57:40,344 --> 03:57:43,566
So I move approval on this kind of common sense measure.

3145
03:57:45,243 --> 03:57:49,086
On the motion of Councilor Morrell, Councilor Behrs.

3146
03:57:49,306 --> 03:58:00,194
And I would just add that it's actually a cost savings to the restaurants and businesses as well, because they're not just giving away these utensils and other materials that they're purchasing and may never be used.

3147
03:58:00,474 --> 03:58:00,795
Thank you.

3148
03:58:01,255 --> 03:58:01,575
Thank you.

3149
03:58:01,655 --> 03:58:04,157
On the motion of Councilor Morrell, Councilor Behrs, seconded by?

3150
03:58:04,177 --> 03:58:06,079
Mr. President.

3151
03:58:06,119 --> 03:58:06,579
Councilor Knight.

3152
03:58:06,799 --> 03:58:08,420
I think during these trying times,

3153
03:58:10,253 --> 03:58:14,755
placing more restrictions and more burdens on businesses and eating establishments is the last thing we should be doing.

3154
03:58:15,356 --> 03:58:19,598
If I go to Carol's restaurant and I sit down and I want to have something to eat and I say, no, Mari, keep the silverware.

3155
03:58:20,759 --> 03:58:22,199
I don't want the silverware, I want the plastic.

3156
03:58:22,460 --> 03:58:33,125
Or I can, plastic by request, I just don't understand it, Mr. President, if they send out a delivery to a house or a work establishment, then they get a phone call, there are no forks and knives, can you bring them back?

3157
03:58:33,586 --> 03:58:34,926
I mean, it puts an impact on the business.

3158
03:58:36,247 --> 03:58:41,549
When it comes to cost-saving measures and cost-cutting measures, businesses do a pretty good job policing themselves and regulating themselves.

3159
03:58:42,090 --> 03:58:44,010
And if this is something that they want to implement, they should.

3160
03:58:45,031 --> 03:58:56,376
But I just don't think at this point in time, further regulating and further burdening businesses, especially, mostly these are small businesses that do take up business, is the right thing to do at this point in time, Mr. President.

3161
03:58:56,396 --> 03:58:57,576
So for that reason, I'll be voting no.

3162
03:58:58,677 --> 03:58:59,477
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3163
03:58:59,617 --> 03:59:01,438
Any other questions or comments from the council?

3164
03:59:02,198 --> 03:59:02,718
Mr. President.

3165
03:59:02,939 --> 03:59:03,519
Councilor Marks.

3166
03:59:04,402 --> 03:59:09,383
Is this for take-out only or is it for dine-in take-out?

3167
03:59:10,043 --> 03:59:10,584
Good question.

3168
03:59:10,604 --> 03:59:12,304
I'm not quite sure what this applies to.

3169
03:59:12,344 --> 03:59:13,924
Could the Council please clarify?

3170
03:59:14,384 --> 03:59:16,145
The intent was for take-out and delivery.

3171
03:59:18,485 --> 03:59:19,406
Take-out and delivery.

3172
03:59:19,506 --> 03:59:21,806
Oh, so OK, it's just take-out and delivery only?

3173
03:59:22,366 --> 03:59:25,147
Yeah, I mean, I don't.

3174
03:59:25,867 --> 03:59:31,729
Yes, it was just the idea that sometimes you get 10 forks and knives stuck in a bag, and you don't need them.

3175
03:59:32,469 --> 03:59:33,269
And if you need them, you could

3176
03:59:34,145 --> 03:59:39,410
just say, can you add forks and knives to the delivery order is essentially the intent.

3177
03:59:39,470 --> 03:59:58,548
I mean, given the conditions and also the staff enforcement levels that we are able to operate in the city, I think this would largely be more of a guidance and a suggestion or, you know, I do not think that we will have someone in every restaurant enforcing the, you know, utensil policy with the severe, you know,

3178
03:59:59,155 --> 04:00:02,118
I think it's more to say, you know, this is something that's easy to do.

3179
04:00:03,098 --> 04:00:03,879
You may not be doing it.

3180
04:00:03,919 --> 04:00:10,144
It helps a lot, given the fact that the rise in takeout and delivery is so much higher.

3181
04:00:10,564 --> 04:00:18,571
You know, there were, when we had full in-restaurant dining, indoor dining, most people were getting silverware at the restaurant, right?

3182
04:00:19,011 --> 04:00:22,454
Now, a lot more people are doing takeout and delivery instead of eating indoors.

3183
04:00:22,914 --> 04:00:27,738
So, you know, usually when you get something delivered or you take something out, it comes home, you have silverware at home.

3184
04:00:28,213 --> 04:00:36,178
Then you have four plastic forks and knives in your bag, too, and they end up being unused or stuffed in a drawer at best, if not just immediately thrown away.

3185
04:00:36,939 --> 04:00:41,242
So that was the intent of this resolution.

3186
04:00:44,944 --> 04:00:48,727
OK, so first of all, do you want to amend the resolution to say take out only?

3187
04:00:50,088 --> 04:00:55,852
Sure, I'd be happy to only provide plastic utensils, straws, and stirrers.

3188
04:00:56,692 --> 04:00:59,653
for takeout and delivery upon the request of the customer.

3189
04:01:03,114 --> 04:01:03,714
Mr. President.

3190
04:01:03,955 --> 04:01:08,416
Yes, let's see, Councilor Marks had the floor, and then Councilor Morrell had her hand up.

3191
04:01:08,456 --> 04:01:09,156
Councilor Marks.

3192
04:01:09,596 --> 04:01:10,637
I just want to understand.

3193
04:01:11,377 --> 04:01:14,338
I think Councilor Beers said this would be for guidance.

3194
04:01:14,978 --> 04:01:21,520
However, it's asking the Board of Health and the Office of Energy and Environment to establish a policy.

3195
04:01:22,141 --> 04:01:25,542
Most policies will have some type of enforcement

3196
04:01:26,682 --> 04:01:27,522
with the policy.

3197
04:01:27,542 --> 04:01:33,044
So do you anticipate an enforcement onto this policy, or is it guidance?

3198
04:01:33,064 --> 04:01:34,965
Because they're two completely different things.

3199
04:01:36,686 --> 04:01:41,327
I mean, I think functionally a lot of our policies are not enforced fully.

3200
04:01:41,347 --> 04:01:45,849
That was just a statement that I was making in general, because we don't have the resources to do that.

3201
04:01:47,069 --> 04:01:54,792
If changing the word policy to guidance would make counselors more amenable to moving this forward, I personally would be happy to do that.

3202
04:01:56,570 --> 04:01:56,910
Thank you.

3203
04:01:58,492 --> 04:02:10,664
Well, I'm not sure, Mr. President, if we currently don't have enough resources, why would we add on another administrative responsibility if we don't have enough resources right now to control what we have?

3204
04:02:11,325 --> 04:02:14,448
I just don't know what this is getting at, Mr. President.

3205
04:02:15,912 --> 04:02:21,574
If I'm at work and I order a cup of soup and it arrives and there's no spoon, that's a concern, Mr. President.

3206
04:02:22,974 --> 04:02:34,537
And I guess we take for granted that a restaurant, if I'm doing takeout, is going to put the necessary things in the bag so I can consume my food.

3207
04:02:35,098 --> 04:02:39,979
And part of that may be a straw, a napkin, whatever it might be.

3208
04:02:40,719 --> 04:02:43,101
And so I'm not quite sure what this is getting at.

3209
04:02:43,161 --> 04:02:47,605
Is this COVID related or is this outside of COVID?

3210
04:02:47,625 --> 04:02:53,650
I don't know what this is getting at.

3211
04:02:54,631 --> 04:02:55,872
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3212
04:02:56,272 --> 04:02:56,993
Councilor Morrell.

3213
04:02:57,989 --> 04:02:58,669
Thank you, Mr. President.

3214
04:02:58,789 --> 04:03:04,353
I mean, this is in direct response to just the increase of single-use plastics that's come as a result of COVID.

3215
04:03:04,393 --> 04:03:11,016
There's a lot of, you know, unfortunately the meals that are not being had inside of restaurants are being replaced, thankfully, by takeout.

3216
04:03:11,757 --> 04:03:15,539
And there's just, it's so much more plastic that does come with a cost.

3217
04:03:15,599 --> 04:03:16,739
It comes with a cost to all of us.

3218
04:03:17,140 --> 04:03:24,864
It comes with a cost to future counselors introducing resolutions when these forks and spoons are on the felsway dumped in someone's yard and we want to have them cleaned up.

3219
04:03:25,984 --> 04:03:32,567
I mean, I think it's, this is actually a fairly, some ordering services, this is a common selection.

3220
04:03:32,627 --> 04:03:35,688
You can select whether or not to have utensils.

3221
04:03:35,788 --> 04:03:51,295
I know a few establishments I frequent in Medford actually do have this option, and it would be something that, again, just guidance, I imagine this is guidance as well, but something that when you're placing an order, someone on the phone says, okay, do you need utensils with that, as opposed to just,

3222
04:03:52,135 --> 04:03:56,920
Throwing a fistful in but again, this is not something that we have the ability to really

3223
04:03:59,620 --> 04:04:07,804
It's not something we really have the ability to enforce, of course, but I think having guidance that people can look to and say, okay, this is probably just a way to minimize waste.

3224
04:04:07,924 --> 04:04:24,731
I think it's, is there a direct response to the way the pandemic has reshaped the, and really to push back a lot of advances we have made in reusables and now has really increased the amount of plastic trash we're seeing, you know, as a community globally, everywhere.

3225
04:04:25,672 --> 04:04:25,912
Thank you.

3226
04:04:27,407 --> 04:04:27,987
Mr. President.

3227
04:04:28,127 --> 04:04:33,608
Just if I could, I'm a little confused.

3228
04:04:33,648 --> 04:04:45,190
If it's something we can't enforce, then why are we asking to a border health and the energy environment office to establish a policy?

3229
04:04:45,570 --> 04:04:52,212
If it's something we can't enforce and then only to only provide plastic utensils upon request.

3230
04:04:52,592 --> 04:04:53,952
So you're asking businesses,

3231
04:04:54,988 --> 04:04:57,089
not to provide this unless someone asks you.

3232
04:04:57,909 --> 04:05:09,053
So I don't understand how they're saying in one point it's, you know, it's only, you know, it's, it's, it's just guidance, but they want a policy that surrounds it.

3233
04:05:10,187 --> 04:05:29,110
and I assume a policy, you know, to me, the better approach would be if this is a cause and something you're interested in, why not approach the Chamber of Commerce and ask the Chamber of Commerce, hey, you know what, we're concerned about the plastic utensils and the number of utensils that are given out and I share a lot of those concerns.

3234
04:05:29,691 --> 04:05:38,083
But I'm not sure a legislative enactment or a policy has to be the way to go about getting the word out in the community.

3235
04:05:38,364 --> 04:05:44,212
You may have businesses owners that would love to save money, because they're very expensive, by the way.

3236
04:05:45,153 --> 04:05:51,018
And they may love to save money on that, but I'm not sure this is the appropriate way of doing this, Mr. President.

3237
04:05:51,638 --> 04:05:57,843
And we heard for a long period of time about doing away with straws.

3238
04:05:58,363 --> 04:06:01,425
Now it's stirrers, plastic utensils.

3239
04:06:04,508 --> 04:06:07,630
I just think there's a better way of doing this, Mr. President.

3240
04:06:07,910 --> 04:06:09,331
Therefore, I cannot support this tonight.

3241
04:06:09,511 --> 04:06:10,132
Mr. President.

3242
04:06:10,692 --> 04:06:11,713
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3243
04:06:11,733 --> 04:06:13,594
We have Councilor Knight and Councilor Behrs.

3244
04:06:13,634 --> 04:06:14,175
Councilor Knight.

3245
04:06:15,697 --> 04:06:21,359
I was just going to ask if Mr. Costas was still on the call from the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. President, but I think he goes to bed at 930.

3246
04:06:22,940 --> 04:06:24,040
He's not with us any longer.

3247
04:06:26,221 --> 04:06:26,581
Thank you.

3248
04:06:26,801 --> 04:06:27,541
Thank you, Councilor Nye.

3249
04:06:27,562 --> 04:06:28,282
Councilor Behrs?

3250
04:06:28,742 --> 04:06:34,904
I'd be happy to propose that I amend the words a policy to guidance.

3251
04:06:35,424 --> 04:06:35,745
Guidance?

3252
04:06:39,646 --> 04:06:41,407
So you have guidance and takeout only.

3253
04:06:41,647 --> 04:06:42,587
Takeout and delivery only.

3254
04:06:43,167 --> 04:06:43,387
Yes.

3255
04:06:44,268 --> 04:06:44,388
OK.

3256
04:06:45,515 --> 04:06:47,276
have a motion to approve.

3257
04:06:47,436 --> 04:06:48,177
I have the floor, Sir.

3258
04:06:48,197 --> 04:06:52,480
So there was there was a couple of a couple of amendments that were put forth.

3259
04:07:16,708 --> 04:07:17,528
Let me check with the clerk.

3260
04:07:23,110 --> 04:07:24,210
It's buffered by both, right?

3261
04:07:24,250 --> 04:07:29,092
Yeah, because I moved approval because I moved approval and then Councilor Behrs wanted to speak.

3262
04:07:29,712 --> 04:07:31,293
So I kind of jumped the gun on moving approval.

3263
04:07:32,053 --> 04:07:34,274
So I very rudely moved approval before he could speak.

3264
04:07:35,735 --> 04:07:36,415
Is there a second?

3265
04:07:37,088 --> 04:07:41,209
Okay, so technically under Robert's rules, once discussion has occurred, there is a second.

3266
04:07:41,229 --> 04:07:48,170
I'm just saying that technically under Robert's rules, once discussion has occurred, it functions as a second.

3267
04:07:48,590 --> 04:07:58,072
So I have a, the consular morale did move approval, but I don't have, I don't have a second in my notes.

3268
04:07:58,212 --> 04:08:01,953
So, and the clerk doesn't have a second either.

3269
04:08:02,033 --> 04:08:02,473
Okay.

3270
04:08:06,148 --> 04:08:06,949
We can put it on file.

3271
04:08:06,989 --> 04:08:07,890
You just take a vote on it.

3272
04:08:07,950 --> 04:08:08,330
Either way.

3273
04:08:08,590 --> 04:08:17,118
The motion is Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Behrs, as amended by Councilor Behrs twice.

3274
04:08:19,079 --> 04:08:20,140
Clerk Herbies, please call the roll.

3275
04:08:24,584 --> 04:08:25,165
Councilor Behrs?

3276
04:08:25,305 --> 04:08:25,525
Yes.

3277
04:08:28,427 --> 04:08:29,148
Vice President Kerrio?

3278
04:08:29,168 --> 04:08:29,208
No.

3279
04:08:32,771 --> 04:08:33,251
Councilor Knight?

3280
04:08:33,532 --> 04:08:33,612
No.

3281
04:08:36,272 --> 04:08:36,812
Councilor Marks?

3282
04:08:37,033 --> 04:08:37,213
No.

3283
04:08:39,775 --> 04:08:40,315
Councilor Morrell?

3284
04:08:40,696 --> 04:08:40,916
Yes.

3285
04:08:43,438 --> 04:08:44,138
Councilor Scarpelli?

3286
04:08:44,519 --> 04:08:44,719
No.

3287
04:08:46,600 --> 04:08:47,241
President Falcone?

3288
04:08:47,942 --> 04:08:48,142
Yes.

3289
04:08:48,502 --> 04:08:50,424
3 in the affirmative, 4 in the negative.

3290
04:08:50,604 --> 04:08:51,424
The motion fails.

3291
04:08:51,444 --> 04:08:58,610
20-667, offered by Council of Bears, Chapter 49, Housing.

3292
04:08:58,870 --> 04:09:00,872
Mr. President, motion to waive the reading.

3293
04:09:04,988 --> 04:09:07,729
I would be happy to provide a brief summary.

3294
04:09:07,929 --> 04:09:13,211
Prior, I was also going to make a motion to send it to the solicitor for review before holding a committee of the whole meeting.

3295
04:09:13,251 --> 04:09:15,231
But I would be happy to provide a brief summary if.

3296
04:09:15,711 --> 04:09:17,172
Please do so.

3297
04:09:17,212 --> 04:09:28,315
Essentially, back in January, I filed a paper requesting that the city solicitor develop a framework for an ordinance around regulations for short-term rentals.

3298
04:09:29,856 --> 04:09:33,777
The Acts of 2018 by the Massachusetts General

3299
04:09:34,139 --> 04:09:41,945
Court, the Mass General Laws, allow the city to implement regulations around short-term rentals, including a registry.

3300
04:09:43,206 --> 04:09:50,751
This would complement the vote we took earlier this year to charge an excise tax to short-term rental properties in the community.

3301
04:09:52,333 --> 04:10:03,541
I based this ordinance, which is pretty lengthy, as you can see, both on the solicitor's framework as well as ordinances in Boston and Salem

3302
04:10:04,038 --> 04:10:16,926
But I did, I think, strike a balance different from both of those ordinances in this proposed ordinance for sake of time and the fact that this is one of the last things on the agenda.

3303
04:10:17,607 --> 04:10:30,615
I would make a motion to send this draft to the solicitor for review and then hold a committee of the whole with the building commissioner, finance director, community development director, and city solicitor after it has been reviewed.

3304
04:10:31,761 --> 04:10:33,962
Mr. President, similar papers are already in the ordinance committee.

3305
04:10:35,783 --> 04:10:39,745
Councilor Marks.

3306
04:10:40,166 --> 04:10:50,351
Why would we send a draft ordinance to the city solicitor for review?

3307
04:10:50,631 --> 04:10:51,412
I haven't seen it.

3308
04:10:52,612 --> 04:10:57,135
Why would we have a city solicitor look at a seven page draft ordinance

3309
04:10:58,058 --> 04:11:07,342
that hasn't been looked at by this council, no recommendations by this council, no public meeting by this council, other than the fact that it paid off this agenda.

3310
04:11:07,842 --> 04:11:12,204
Why would we send this paper to the city solicitor for review?

3311
04:11:12,304 --> 04:11:13,364
Review of what?

3312
04:11:13,884 --> 04:11:14,885
Review of this language?

3313
04:11:16,258 --> 04:11:19,820
Is the city solicitor now part of this council?

3314
04:11:20,620 --> 04:11:21,981
I mean, I don't understand.

3315
04:11:22,061 --> 04:11:32,005
I don't understand putting the seven-page ordinance on, Mr. President, because we have ways of initiating subjects, Mr. President, for this council.

3316
04:11:32,826 --> 04:11:40,009
But, hey, that could be, you know, I'm not going to criticize that, but why would we send a paper to the city solicitor?

3317
04:11:40,029 --> 04:11:41,830
It makes zero sense at all.

3318
04:11:42,990 --> 04:11:44,432
I would like to provide some answers.

3319
04:11:44,472 --> 04:11:45,452
Councilor Marks, I'll answer that.

3320
04:11:45,472 --> 04:11:56,881
The reason I offered the motion was because in 2017, in 2019, in 2020, we've tasked the city solicitor with drafting an ordinance relative to short-term rentals in the community.

3321
04:11:57,381 --> 04:12:09,310
Between 2017 and 2019, there was a series of litigation events and other regulatory parameters that were established that created a criteria that would now allow a community to do this.

3322
04:12:10,031 --> 04:12:11,412
So I know I've sent

3323
04:12:12,960 --> 04:12:24,923
the solicitor's office at least 50 pages worth of documentation, a white page report on best practices on how to regulate short-term rentals and the like.

3324
04:12:25,183 --> 04:12:31,765
And in the last discussion that we had with the city solicitor, it was that she was working on a draft, still to date, I do believe.

3325
04:12:32,385 --> 04:12:40,007
And the reason to send this to her would be to have her review it and contrast it with what she has already worked on to see if there's any items in here that might be

3326
04:12:40,707 --> 04:12:43,749
left out and then present it back to the council for us to review.

3327
04:12:44,369 --> 04:12:47,231
That seems like a convoluted way of going about this.

3328
04:12:47,291 --> 04:12:48,572
It really does.

3329
04:12:48,952 --> 04:12:53,514
I know I appreciate your response, but that seems like we're the legislative body.

3330
04:12:53,595 --> 04:13:00,959
So if this is language that we want to attain, we should send it to committee, the whole subcommittee, take a look at it, review it.

3331
04:13:01,759 --> 04:13:13,484
It just doesn't make sense, especially now knowing that the city solicitor may be working on an ordinance at this council's request and then giving her another seven pages, saying take a look at this, unless we think she's doing nothing all day.

3332
04:13:14,444 --> 04:13:15,725
It just makes no sense to me.

3333
04:13:16,465 --> 04:13:17,686
It just makes no sense.

3334
04:13:17,706 --> 04:13:17,966
Mr. President?

3335
04:13:18,286 --> 04:13:22,187
I know that, if I may really quickly, I know that the city solicitor is quite busy.

3336
04:13:23,408 --> 04:13:23,928
Is that Jonathan?

3337
04:13:26,169 --> 04:13:32,494
And I know that, I believe Councilor Knight, you were saying you had an ordinance similar to this.

3338
04:13:32,514 --> 04:13:38,018
The ordinance subcommittee just met, what was it, last month and we prioritized several papers that were in there.

3339
04:13:38,138 --> 04:13:49,906
The first paper I believe was, we had food trucks, we had sick leave bank, we had short term rentals, we had small cell wireless towers were the four top items that we discussed.

3340
04:13:50,066 --> 04:13:52,108
There might have been one other in there out of the five, but

3341
04:13:52,621 --> 04:14:00,806
you know, right there at the top of the iceberg from important items that the subcommittee was going to be working on to put out as a work product to this committee of the whole as well.

3342
04:14:01,646 --> 04:14:06,309
So with that being said, maybe we send it to the subcommittee that's working on that as well.

3343
04:14:06,749 --> 04:14:11,832
And we could take some of the ideas that are in this and contrast it with what the city solicitor gives us when she does.

3344
04:14:12,072 --> 04:14:20,397
That's what I was going to recommend is that when it comes back, then reconcile the two and see what's missing and see if there's something that should be put in.

3345
04:14:22,188 --> 04:14:24,970
I understand that Councilor Knight has introduced resolutions on this as well.

3346
04:14:25,750 --> 04:14:37,156
The item discussed in the ordinance subcommittee, while I'm not a member of the subcommittee, I believe was the paper we received from the city solicitor outlining a draft framework for a short-term rental ordinance, which is what this council requested in January.

3347
04:14:38,557 --> 04:14:44,780
As I was the filer of that request, and then we received a draft framework, which in my opinion was still very

3348
04:14:46,493 --> 04:14:48,594
It was more a list of questions than a framework.

3349
04:14:49,235 --> 04:14:52,517
My assumption from that was that that was the product of the solicitor.

3350
04:14:52,597 --> 04:14:56,799
And so I went ahead using that framework and other ordinances to draft a draft ordinance.

3351
04:14:57,339 --> 04:14:59,341
I'm not a member of the ordinances subcommittee.

3352
04:15:00,401 --> 04:15:05,304
And my intent here, I'd be happy to strip out sending it to the solicitor review and just have a committee of the whole on this.

3353
04:15:05,344 --> 04:15:05,884
That's fine.

3354
04:15:07,265 --> 04:15:10,607
She was part of the process that I initiated with my motion.

3355
04:15:11,107 --> 04:15:12,008
She sent a framework.

3356
04:15:12,488 --> 04:15:14,429
I developed a draft based on that framework.

3357
04:15:16,300 --> 04:15:28,972
I did not think it would be unreasonable to send that back to her, considering that she's been part of this chain of events, but I would be happy to adjust my motion just to have a committee of the whole on this matter with the people I suggested.

3358
04:15:28,992 --> 04:15:33,756
So Councilor Beers, is your motion to move this to committee of the whole for further review?

3359
04:15:33,976 --> 04:15:34,777
Sure, yes.

3360
04:15:35,338 --> 04:15:40,663
On that motion, seconded by... Second.

3361
04:15:41,268 --> 04:15:41,848
Councilor Rao.

3362
04:15:42,608 --> 04:15:43,649
Councilor Knight.

3363
04:15:43,809 --> 04:15:54,071
I do believe when the paper was initially introduced in January, Mr. President, and the clerk may be able to take a look in the records if he hasn't before him, the prior paper was joined to it.

3364
04:15:56,472 --> 04:15:56,792
Which one?

3365
04:15:56,992 --> 04:15:58,052
The prior paper was joined.

3366
04:15:58,492 --> 04:15:58,712
Joined.

3367
04:15:58,812 --> 04:15:59,012
OK.

3368
04:16:00,153 --> 04:16:01,893
What prior paper are you referring to?

3369
04:16:01,953 --> 04:16:04,514
The paper from the previous session that we were working on.

3370
04:16:04,534 --> 04:16:05,174
That's what I'm thinking of.

3371
04:16:05,194 --> 04:16:06,654
I remember there was one that dated a while back.

3372
04:16:06,674 --> 04:16:06,754
Yeah.

3373
04:16:07,335 --> 04:16:09,255
The paper from the previous session was joined to it.

3374
04:16:10,531 --> 04:16:14,675
And now the paper from the previous session still remains in the subcommittee.

3375
04:16:15,496 --> 04:16:17,018
And it's never been reported out of the subcommittee.

3376
04:16:17,959 --> 04:16:22,764
And the reason it hasn't been reported out of the subcommittee is because we're waiting for the information from the city solicitor's office.

3377
04:16:23,545 --> 04:16:29,131
So maybe that's what needs to be had rather than... You know, we can entertain new language, but this seems like it's...

3378
04:16:30,350 --> 04:16:31,971
asking for its own separate process.

3379
04:16:33,493 --> 04:16:36,635
And I think, you know, it's, I don't know.

3380
04:16:38,216 --> 04:16:38,517
Second.

3381
04:16:39,778 --> 04:16:41,359
Is the motion already on the floor?

3382
04:16:41,819 --> 04:16:46,303
I just, if I may, I do not care what process we go through.

3383
04:16:46,703 --> 04:16:49,865
I want to achieve this goal, which we've been trying to achieve for a while.

3384
04:16:50,266 --> 04:16:52,888
I'm happy to do that in any way that my fellow counselors want to do.

3385
04:16:53,362 --> 04:16:57,004
I think that this language reflects good research, and it could be a good baseline.

3386
04:16:57,144 --> 04:17:01,466
I have not seen a proposed ordinance based on the Medford Code of Ordinances.

3387
04:17:01,706 --> 04:17:04,247
That's why I took the liberty of drafting this as a councilor.

3388
04:17:04,728 --> 04:17:13,732
And I did not mean any ill intent by proposing it on this agenda, or to subvert any existing processes, or erase any existing motions.

3389
04:17:13,852 --> 04:17:19,495
So if the council thinks that the Subcommittee on Ordinances is the place to discuss this, that's fine.

3390
04:17:20,530 --> 04:17:23,773
I don't know how I will be able to have input on that discussion, but that's fine with me, too.

3391
04:17:23,833 --> 04:17:25,434
I just want to get something done.

3392
04:17:25,675 --> 04:17:30,359
So I will withdraw my motion in favor of the motion on the subcommittee on ordinances.

3393
04:17:31,320 --> 04:17:33,121
But there's no subterfuge here.

3394
04:17:33,161 --> 04:17:39,407
This is just language and research that I did and wrote out to put before the council to try to advance this issue forward.

3395
04:17:39,847 --> 04:17:40,708
I think it's reasonable.

3396
04:17:41,095 --> 04:17:41,916
I think it's balanced.

3397
04:17:41,996 --> 04:17:49,122
I think upon further review, people will find that this is a good approach for the city and reflects the prior motions that have been made around the issue.

3398
04:17:49,322 --> 04:17:49,683
Thank you.

3399
04:17:49,703 --> 04:17:55,288
So, Councilor Behrs, are you okay with withdrawing that motion and sending it to the subcommittee on ordinances?

3400
04:17:55,608 --> 04:17:56,629
Yes, Mr. President.

3401
04:17:56,749 --> 04:17:59,592
I truly did not think these would be the three controversial issues of the night.

3402
04:18:00,977 --> 04:18:02,979
No one's saying it's controversial.

3403
04:18:03,079 --> 04:18:06,542
We're just saying there's an order of how we do business, Mr. President.

3404
04:18:06,562 --> 04:18:16,230
If we're discussing an item already in subcommittee or committee of the whole, and to reintroduce something different, Mr. President, on the floor is not how we operate as a council.

3405
04:18:16,530 --> 04:18:17,831
That's all that's being said.

3406
04:18:18,131 --> 04:18:19,773
That's not how we operate, Mr. President.

3407
04:18:20,933 --> 04:18:21,734
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

3408
04:18:21,754 --> 04:18:24,877
So Councilor Beers has withdrawn his motion to send it to committee of the whole.

3409
04:18:25,637 --> 04:18:29,961
A motion of Councilor Beers to send it to the subcommittee of ordinances for further review.

3410
04:18:31,979 --> 04:18:32,599
Seconded by?

3411
04:18:33,700 --> 04:18:34,761
Seconded by Councilor Knight?

3412
04:18:36,361 --> 04:18:36,502
Ms.

3413
04:18:36,522 --> 04:18:37,422
Councilor Knight, did you second?

3414
04:18:37,802 --> 04:18:38,002
Yes.

3415
04:18:38,183 --> 04:18:38,523
OK.

3416
04:18:38,763 --> 04:18:40,524
On that motion, clerk, please call the roll.

3417
04:18:42,465 --> 04:18:42,965
Councilor Behrs.

3418
04:18:42,985 --> 04:18:43,826
There's no one on line there.

3419
04:18:43,846 --> 04:18:44,086
Yes.

3420
04:18:44,646 --> 04:18:45,527
