00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:05,767
Hello, my name is Dominic Cattino, your favorite voice of Medford High.

2
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:10,569
Today I'm here with Audrey Ledbetter, the Philosopher in Residence here at Medford High School.

3
00:00:11,029 --> 00:00:12,910
Thank you for joining me today, Miss Audrey.

4
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:14,011
Thank you.

5
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:19,614
All right, so before we get started, can you please share with us what exactly is a Philosopher in Residence?

6
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:30,639
Yes, a Philosopher in Residence is a way of infusing philosophy into high schools that takes pressure off of faculty and administrators so that someone with philosophy experience

7
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:42,614
with an education in philosophy can include philosophy into a high school without having to hire a teacher who has a background in philosophy, a PhD in philosophy, and that sort of thing.

8
00:00:42,694 --> 00:00:47,437
So the kind of work that I've done so far is I've guest lectured in a class about justice.

9
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:50,038
I've been working with the Ethics Bowl team.

10
00:00:50,499 --> 00:01:00,505
I've been working with the Tufts Philosophy Workshop, which is an after school program on Thursdays that students can come and break out into groups

11
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:07,839
Tufts philosophy students to talk about different philosophical topics and what else have I done.

12
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,861
I've also led a professional development workshop, which was really awesome.

13
00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:17,323
And yeah, so basically I'm just a resource to expand and support all philosophy programs here.

14
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:18,847
Lovely.

15
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:24,548
Does that have anything to do at all with the Ethics Bowl or the Ethics Club or whatever it's called?

16
00:01:24,588 --> 00:01:25,468
Yeah.

17
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:31,409
I wouldn't say that my role is to support the Ethics Bowl.

18
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:36,330
The Ethics Bowl has been here for 10 years, actually, since Ethics Bowl began.

19
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,871
And my work has been assisting them as a coach.

20
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:42,191
I also coach the Tufts Ethics Bowl team.

21
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:44,831
And we did really well this year.

22
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:47,512
And I was just at nationals with the high school.

23
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,994
team and we got fourth, which was awesome.

24
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,137
Why do you think it's important for philosophy to be taught in high school?

25
00:01:54,625 --> 00:02:07,253
Yeah, so when I think about philosophy, pre-college philosophy, well, first of all, philosophy is something that is generally associated with academia, with college, higher education.

26
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:14,658
And philosophy, to me and to the people who do this work, is not something that should be confined in such a way.

27
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:17,780
And so the idea

28
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:27,868
Of having philosophy in high schools is to sort of break out of that stereotype of philosophy and also to when I think about teaching philosophy before college.

29
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:28,869
I think about two things.

30
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:30,691
I think about the method of doing philosophy.

31
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:32,584
and the topics in philosophy.

32
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:54,709
So when we think about the method of philosophy, it's a lot about independent, critical thinking, using, like, thinking about, thinking through things, discussion, talking with people, like, using argumentation, figuring out how to structure an argument, how to defend a claim, how to, like, how to give way to counterarguments, and that sort of thing that's, like, very, very

33
00:02:55,269 --> 00:03:12,498
fundamental to the practice of doing philosophy and that kind of method and that kind of independent critical thinking is something that is very important for democratic participation and also just general empowerment for a student to be able to think for themselves and not be given, you know, a list of

34
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:21,950
you know, biological things to memorize, you know, or write a paper in English about a certain book.

35
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,857
It's really to like, it's the method I think transcends

36
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:30,147
different departments and different types of classes.

37
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:44,786
So topics like, you know, starting out with like what is the meaning of life, which is very broad, and like with Ethics Bowl we do a lot of ethical issues, like some of the issues that came up in high school cases were taking in

38
00:03:45,547 --> 00:04:00,764
immigrants, what were other good ones, Chad GPT, the morality of GMOs, and just things like that, like thinking about complex ethical issues that might come up tangential to other classes in high school but aren't given

39
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:01,945
the full treatment.

40
00:04:03,086 --> 00:04:24,885
So there's ethics, there's you know the meaning of life, there's free will, do we have free will, there's metaphysics, what is what exists, there's epistemology, how do we know something, and these are all topics that are very important to education generally and really touch a lot on the topics that are taught in high schools but never really given the time of day.

41
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,828
because of, for plenty of very good reasons.

42
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:37,633
So the idea of having me here is that I am a resource to kind of like expand thinking in those areas beyond what's taught in the normal high school curriculum.

43
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,694
On top of Ethics Bowl, do you do anything with mock trials with the school?

44
00:04:42,014 --> 00:04:43,635
No, I haven't worked with mock trial yet.

45
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:49,139
I'm just starting to get my bearings and get involved with Ethics Bowl.

46
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:55,043
Mr. Esner, the teacher who works with Ethics Bowl, is a teacher we've worked with in the past for the philosophy workshop.

47
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:57,845
So I've kind of started with his work in philosophy.

48
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:00,767
He also teaches an intro philosophy class here.

49
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:06,571
So that's where I've started, but I hope to expand to more areas.

50
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:07,712
So not mock trial yet.

51
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:11,592
What philosophical question are you most interested in right now?

52
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:19,597
Right now, I am most interested in what does it mean to have character as a person.

53
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:24,039
It's the term character comes up all the time.

54
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:28,541
You know, character development, character growth, when you're watching a series, like character growth.

55
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:34,244
And also like going back to Aristotle and Plato, they talk about a lot about moral character.

56
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:37,906
And like how to develop virtue and moral character.

57
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:40,967
And there's also, you know, colloquially we talk about like

58
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:44,408
out of character actions and someone acting out of character.

59
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:50,253
So right now I'm just really interested in pinning down what it actually means to have character as a person.

60
00:05:50,753 --> 00:05:52,394
Is it something that we automatically have?

61
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:55,096
Is it something that we grow to have?

62
00:05:56,337 --> 00:05:56,958
And that kind of thing.

63
00:05:56,998 --> 00:06:03,203
So that's where my real interests are in philosophy right now, beyond doing this, the work in the high schools.

64
00:06:03,923 --> 00:06:05,425
Do you have a favorite philosopher?

65
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:16,364
Philosopher, this is hard because when people ask this they expect me to say like, you know, Plato, Aristotle, you know, all of these, you know, fancy old names.

66
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:22,112
There's a woman named Amiya Srinivasan at Oxford who's doing

67
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:38,812
feminist philosophy and she recently wrote a book called The Right to Sex that feminism in the 21st century and it's just it's very it's very measured and very well written and I find her writing both like compelling and technically philosophically good so I would say

68
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,693
That is my favorite philosopher right now.

69
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:43,874
But I feel like I'm missing so many people.

70
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:44,694
But yeah.

71
00:06:44,774 --> 00:06:46,795
And you said she is at Tufts.

72
00:06:46,855 --> 00:06:48,075
She's at Oxford.

73
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:49,455
She's currently at Oxford.

74
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:50,256
But yeah, present day.

75
00:06:50,316 --> 00:06:51,016
She's alive right now.

76
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:53,656
And there are a lot of amazing philosophers at Tufts too.

77
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:57,097
One of our faculty just won a Pulitzer Prize, which is awesome.

78
00:06:57,677 --> 00:06:59,378
And everyone's just doing really exciting work.

79
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,418
And it's really fun to be around them.

80
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:01,810
All right.

81
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:02,531
Lovely.

82
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:04,494
Thank you so much for being here.

83
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:05,635
We appreciate your time.

84
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:07,858
And those answers were lovely, even though you didn't prepare for it.

85
00:07:08,059 --> 00:07:11,323
Thank you so much for giving me the time to answer.

86
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:14,407
Can we dip to black now?

87
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:15,789
I made that awkward.
