 ព័ត៌មានលម្អិតមួយចំនួនអំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះគឺជាការជូនដំណឹងអំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំសាធារណៈនេះត្រូវបានបោះពុម្ពផ្សាយនៅក្នុងកាសែត Medford Transcript នៅថ្ងៃទី 8 ខែកក្កដា ឆ្នាំ 2021។
 អ្នកជិតខាងទាំងអស់ក្នុងចម្ងាយ 300 ហ្វីតនៃ Mystic Avenue ក៏ត្រូវបានជូនដំណឹងអំពីការប្រជុំតាមរយៈសំបុត្រដែលមានការបញ្ជាក់ផងដែរ។
 ទីក្រុង Medford ក៏បានប្រកាសកិច្ចប្រជុំនៅលើគេហទំព័ររបស់ខ្លួនផងដែរ។
 កំណត់ចំណាំរហ័សមួយចំនួនដែលខ្ញុំចង់បន្ថែមគឺថាកិច្ចប្រជុំរួមបញ្ចូលសមត្ថភាពក្នុងការបង្កើតចំណងជើងបិទសម្រាប់អ្នកដែលត្រូវការពួកវាជាផ្នែកនៃស្ថានភាព។

 ដូច្នេះ ចំណងជើងរងគឺតែងតែមានសម្រាប់អ្នកដែលត្រូវការវា។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាលក្ខណៈពិសេសនេះគឺនៅក្នុងម៉ឺនុយទាញចុះក្រោមនៅផ្នែកខាងក្រោមនៃអេក្រង់។

 នោះហើយជាកន្លែងដែលក្រុមហ៊ុនរបស់យើងចូលមក។
 យើងតំណាងឱ្យ 3A Wellness នៅរដ្ឋ Massachusetts ហើយ CCC បានកំណត់យើងជាភាគីអព្យាក្រឹតនៅក្នុងកិច្ចប្រជុំ ពីព្រោះយើងមិនមានការគ្រប់គ្រងដោយផ្ទាល់ ឬដោយប្រយោលលើអាជ្ញាប័ណ្ណនោះទេ។
 សូមធ្វើបទបង្ហាញបន្ទាប់។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=601.659s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome everyone to our community outreach meeting.
 It is a privilege to be able to discuss our plans with you all this evening, and I very much look forward to the chance to answer your questions and respond to your comments later on in the meeting.
 As a bit of background, I am one of the founders of Theory Wellness, a local cannabis organization that is headquartered in Stoneham.
 We were founded in 2015 and our mission is to create the highest quality dispensary experience for our local communities, our customers, and our employees.
 We have a long and successful track record of operating compliant, safe, and community-centric dispensaries in the Commonwealth, and now employ approximately 300 talented team members here in Massachusetts, providing living wages and a comprehensive benefit package, including a 401k plan.
 We are well known as one of the most respected cannabis organizations in the state, routinely meeting with a variety of cannabis industry stakeholders and regulators to help improve how legal cannabis works here in Massachusetts.
 We take our responsibility to operate as industry leaders very seriously and would be honored to bring our world-class operations to Medford.
 Our first dispensary is a medical only facility that we opened in Bridgewater in 2017.
 We have since then grown to operate two other dispensaries in Massachusetts, one in Chicopee and one in Great Barrington, both of which serve medical patients and adult use customers.
 The Great Barrington location was one of the first recreational stores to open in the state, and that was in January of 2019.
 So this has given us over two years of experience, which is very helpful here in Medford, on how to operate these businesses successfully.
 Thierry also operates indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities and manufactures a wide variety of products.
 In sum, we operate 10 different cannabis licenses here in Massachusetts, which is equal or more to any operational experience of any other business in the state.
 Having at this point served over 1 million different customers in Massachusetts, we look forward to bringing our extensive experience and track record to our South Medford neighborhood.
 Next slide, please.
 After that as well, please.
 So community is very important for us at Theory.
 And that's one of the unique aspects on how we run our business is our approach to community relations.
 We believe the relationship begins by being good listeners, understanding the concerns and desires from all the stakeholders in the community.
 From day one, Theory has listened to and worked closely with our communities to develop positive working relationships that extend from government officials to local businesses, to grassroots organizations, and most importantly, local residents.
 Theory was one of the first cannabis companies in the state to develop a host community agreement, working with the town of Bridgewater since 2016 to share a portion of our revenue with the town to support their municipal programming.
 Since then, Theory has contributed over $8 million in direct financial contributions to our host communities.
 Beyond hiring locally and providing significant economic stimulus, we have focused on building long-term collaborative relationships with municipal governments, as well as local community organizations.
 We have launched an educational series on cannabis, sponsored numerous charitable events, hosted food and clothing drives, and supported over 20 nonprofits in our local communities.
 We look forward to continue on this path with our new project here in Medford.
 Next slide, please.
 So this slide is an overview of our site plan.
 We're proposing a marijuana retailer to be located at 162 Mystic Avenue.
 The site is currently vacant and was previously used as a car dealership.
 Our proposal is to completely renovate and beautify not just the building, but the entire site.
 We searched for over a year to find the perfect location for a dispensary and are extremely happy to be proposing a location at 162 Mystic Ave for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed throughout the presentation.
 These reasons include first and foremost parking.
 This site includes 59 parking stalls with the site plan that you're looking at right now, which is critical to ensure that no traffic issues arise and that we have no nuisance to our neighborhood.
 Number two, the details of the site are pretty unique.
 As shown in the site plan, we have selected a building that has enough space to not just house a dispensary, but also donate 10,000 square feet of space to the arts community, which we will look forward to providing more information on in the upcoming slides.
 Another key benefit of this proposal is that we are able to develop the dispensary in the rear of the building, ensuring that the dispensary is discreetly featured on Mystic Avenue and not front and center.
 Earlier this year, we commissioned a poll of over 250 Medford residents, and it was clear that the majority of residents preferred a dispensary to be discreetly cited like this proposal and not prominently on a main road.
 Next slide, please.
 In respect to zoning compliance, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, Medford has a zoning ordinance that designates the C2 and industrial zones as the two areas in the city where an adult-use dispensary can operate.
 This use is subject to obtaining a special permit from the Zoning Board of Affairs, and there are not regulations from the local health board pertaining to dispensaries.
 That being said, theory has proposed a comprehensive plan to monitor local health impacts and looks forward to working with the Medford Health Department to safely operate our business.
 Our site at 162 Mystic Ave is in the C2 district and is in full compliance with the city's zoning ordinance.
 Importantly, we are over 500 feet away from any K through 12 schools, as shown as a diagram here.
 We have already fully designed our site and construction plans and look forward to working with local builders and contractors when we are ready to construct our facility.
 Renderings of our exterior and interior are provided on the following slides.
 Next slide, please.
 Perfect.
 So this is the proposed exterior of the dispensary.
 As you can see, we, you know, are renovating the entire site and really beautifying the exterior of the building.
 Next slide.
 The proposed interior rendering is where we create a welcoming, bright, and safe environment for our guests.
 Next slide.
 So now we're going to talk about a very interesting partnership we have here with the arts community in Medford.
 A core value of ours, and one of the primary reasons of our success to date, is our steadfast commitment to contributing in meaningful ways to the communities that we operate in.
 In Medford, we are extremely excited and fortunate to be proposing a variety of ways in which we will expect to benefit the community.
 First and foremost, we have established a tremendous partnership with the arts community in Medford.
 For the last six months, we have had discussions with local leaders in the arts community and learned that despite good efforts and intentions, the arts community in Medford has never been able to find a home.
 That will all change with Theory Medford.
 We have committed to donating 10,000 square feet of our building to the Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that will help manage this brand new arts center.
 In addition to providing the space free of charge, Theory will completely renovate the space to the specifications necessary to provide this community benefit.
 This will create studio space, meeting space, office space, and performing space for the arts.
 Our architect has already been working on preliminary floor plans as mentioned on this slide and we couldn't be happier with the partnership and if all goes to plan we would have the community art center up and running in early 2022.
 Next slide.
 Theory understands that diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity are necessary foundational pillars in building a strong team that represents the communities we operate in and facilitates the creation of a value-driven organization.
 Theory also recognizes how the war on drugs disproportionately affected certain communities of color.
 As leaders in the cannabis industry, we have a real responsibility to lead by example, create positive change, and foster opportunities for generational wealth creation for those who have been negatively affected by the unjust historical policies.
 To that end, in 2019 theory launched a first of its kind social equity program, providing $250,000 in no strings attached zero interest financing.
 In addition to resources training and coaching to an economic empowerment applicant who is in the process of launching their own dispensary.
 After interviewing around a dozen qualified applicants, in July of 2019, Theory selected entrepreneurs Vanessa Jean Baptiste and Mark Bouquet of Legal Greens to be the first participants in our program.
 Legal Greens is comprised of these two business partners, both Black, one being a woman, who grew up and reside in neighborhoods that were adversely affected by the war on drugs.
 After nearly two years, in March 2021, Legal Greens opened their recreational dispensary in Brockton, becoming the first Black-owned
 woman-owned recreational dispensary on the East Coast.
 We're very proud of the team at Legal Greens and look forward to replicating this program in Medford if we're fortunate enough to continue on with our project here.
 Additionally, Theory is committed to hiring a diverse workforce in Medford.
 We truly believe that our people is what allows our company to be most successful and that diversity is an asset to any organization.
 proven to foster improved decision-making, increased innovation, stronger customer relationships, and increased employee engagement.
 In Medford, Theory has worked closely with the Mystic branch of the NAACP on a comprehensive diversity hiring plan.
 We are committed to creating a workforce that is at least 50% women, 35% diverse, and 5% veteran, with this goal extending through all management positions.
 Theory offers terrific advancement opportunities and goes through great lengths in our recruitment process to ensure we are hiring without bias or discrimination.
 Next slide, please.
 A major driver of our positive impact in Medford will be economic.
 First, we plan on hiring over 60 well-paid full-time individuals with a mandate that the workforce is diverse and local.
 Specifically, at least 75% of our employees will be Medford residents.
 All team members are provided comprehensive benefits, which include a 401k plan.
 We're especially proud to offer this 401k plan, which right now is not very common in the cannabis industry due to the challenges in working with finding a provider for a program like that.
 As the number one retailer in Massachusetts, we are confident in our projections that each year our Medford dispensary will provide the city with over $2 million in direct cash contributions through both tax revenue and our community host agreement.
 In addition to the commitments to donate to the arts community, Theory has also allocated $50,000 per year to support local nonprofits.
 This is consistent with our track record as we have already support dozens of nonprofits throughout the state.
 Next slide, please.
 We acknowledge and appreciate that one of the possible negative impacts from an adult use dispensary is localized traffic condition.
 In order to meet the economic development goals of the city while simultaneously avoiding any traffic congestion problems, an operator must carefully choose a location that is suitable to handle a high volume of customers.
 There are very few properties within the permitted zones in Medford that provide easy access, have sufficient parking, contain good interior space, and would not materially impact localized traffic.
 This is something that we took very seriously and we're well qualified to analyze having years of experience citing and operating high traffic retail dispensers.
 After looking at dozens of options in Medford for our proposed site, we committed to 162 Mystic Avenue based on a number of factors, including and importantly, the site's ability to serve our projected number of customer visits per day from an access parking and favorable traffic impact perspective.
 Our location is a former car dealership located two minutes off 93 with 59 parking stalls, significantly more than what our projected daily customer visits would demand as further detailed below.
 By comparison, in Great Barrington and Chicopee, where we also operate recreational dispensaries, our location served between 600 and over 1,000 customers per day on busy days with less parking capacity and have had zero material traffic issues to date.
 To demonstrate the suitability of our proposed location, Theory engaged a professional traffic engineering and analysis firm to perform a comprehensive traffic study.
 This 27-page traffic study concluded that our operation of a marijuana retailer at 162 Mystic Avenue would not negatively impact traffic on Mystic Ave.
 Furthermore, as we have done at our other locations, we will work closely with the Medford Police Department to ensure we have a comprehensive traffic control plan in place, including police details as necessary for the initial opening period.
 Next slide, please.
 Our track record and experience showcase that our operational plans and staff training will lead to the safe operations of a marijuana retailer in Medford, including ensuring that diversion and underage sales do not take place at our location.
 We have served over 1 million customers in Massachusetts without any underage sales.
 We check identification three times, once at the door, once in the reception room, and again at the sales counter.
 Furthermore, we use a machine called ID Science that scans each identification for validity.
 This equipment is also used in casinos and updates itself every 30 days with a
 comprehensive database of all valid forms of state ID across the country, as well as all passports in the world.
 By using this machine, we have caught hundreds of expired or invalid forms of identification at our other locations.
 All of our products are secured in the vault, which has extensive security features.
 We are also constantly monitoring our parking areas and have a zero tolerance policy for consumption of cannabis on site.
 Any customers that are found to be consuming on site would be permanently banned from returning to our location.
 Next slide, please.
 An important aspect to discuss is the safety and security that will be designed and implemented at our dispensary.
 It is first helpful to acknowledge and appreciate that Theory has served over a million customers with an excellent safety and security track record.
 And in our other communities, we maintain direct lines of communication with our local law enforcement partners, whom have written letters of recommendation, calling Theory a model for others to follow.
 Our comprehensive safety and security plan would first be reviewed with the Medford Police Department prior to being finalized.
 We always look forward to receiving feedback and improving our plan based on conversations with law enforcement professionals.
 At all times during operational hours, Theory has a highly trained safety and security team that works both inside and outside the dispensary.
 They are there to ensure that no prohibited activities take place on our premise.
 In large part due to our terrific safety and security team, we have not had any nuisance complaints about unsavory customer activity from any of our neighbors at our existing locations.
 Moreover, the dispensary will be outfitted with an extensive alarm and video monitoring system using the most modern technology available.
 This technology is a cornerstone of our safety and security plan and allows us to offer both a welcoming and safe environment for our guests and our neighbors.
 Next slide, please.
 Theory is committed to leading the cannabis industry by taking meaningful measures towards achieving a more sustainable future, despite the level of short-term investment it may require.
 Sustainability is a fundamental value at Theory, woven into our decision-making on a daily basis.
 To date, we have invested millions in energy-reductive technology, effectively offsetting over 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year by moving 90% of our cannabis cultivation operations outdoors, and have greened the majority of our energy usage by purchasing over 85% of our energy from renewable sources.
 Our plan for Medford will push our sustainability actions even further.
 We have a 79-point sustainability action plan consisting of bold measures, including the installation of 263 solar panels on our roof, pledging to electrify our vehicles, obtaining 100% of our company-wide energy needs from renewables, purchasing carbon offsets, sourcing from and supporting local businesses, installing electric vehicle charging stations, incentivizing public transportation,
 using sustainable design and building materials, and sponsoring green entrepreneurship in the city of Medford.
 To hold ourselves accountable, we will establish a director of sustainability and engage with third party consultants to audit our dispensary on a periodic basis.
 Theory admires and respects the City of Medford's ambitious goals relating to sustainability and energy efficiency and believes our operation will align with and contribute meaningfully towards a shared mission.
 We look forward to being a corporate steward and a contributing member of the Medford community.
 Next slide, please.
 Over the years, Thierry has spent extensive time in the Medford community to understand the concerns and desires of Medford residents and businesses relating to the siting and operation of a marijuana retailer.
 Thierry undertook an independent survey of over 250 Medford residents and incorporated their feedback into our proposal, ensuring that our location, our charitable initiatives, and our hiring plans serve the community best.
 Additionally, we have forged a remarkable relationship with local arts community to design, construct, and provide free ongoing use of a 10,000 square foot community center for the arts, a landmark partnership of historic value.
 Thierry has spoken extensively with hundreds of abutters, local businesses, local leaders, and residents, and received tremendous support, evidenced by the over 60 local letters of support that we've received from a variety of locations as shown in the map on this slide.
 To ensure our local relationship only continues to strengthen, Thierry will be hiring a full-time director of community relations whose primary responsibility is fostering and strengthening the quality of our relationship with the community.
 This individual will be based in Medford and will serve as the day-to-day face of Thierry and a conduit for our community relations.
 This is beyond attending and participating in meetings and community events relating to our business.
 They'll also be managing our charitable budget for local nonprofits.
 Next slide, please.
 So to sum it up, I am confident that Theory is the most qualified applicant to operate in Medford for a couple of reasons.
 First, we have the experience necessary to ensure our dispensary in Medford will be world-class.
 We have an industry-leading track record of success and safety at our other operations in Great Barrington, Chicopee, and Bridgewater.
 We have served over 1 million guests without incident, while maintaining a 99 percentile customer rating.
 We have become a model company to our regulators, our host communities, and our customers.
 We have demonstrated that we know exactly how to operate a world-class cannabis dispensary.
 Second, we have an ambitious, progressive, and well-thought-out plan for positive community impacts here in Medford.
 We have created an incredible partnership with the arts community to construct and donate a brand new 10,000 square feet center for the arts, a first-of-its-kind program for the city.
 Moreover, we will be providing over 60 well-paying jobs with full benefits in 401k, supporting local businesses and non-profits, financing local entrepreneurs and social equity applicants, and contributing to the sustainability and diversity goals of the City.
 From a pure economic perspective, we will contribute over $2 million per year to the city in direct payments, amounts we have shown to provide to our other communities.
 Third, after years of scouting, we have carefully chosen a location that we believe makes an ideal site for a dispensary from an infrastructure, traffic, and security standpoint.
 Moreover, our location reflects the desires and priorities of the local community.
 Our location at 162 Mystic Avenue is discreet, has tremendous parking, is located in a C2 district away from residential, and will be completely revitalized through our site beautification plan.
 Having been on the forefront of the industry for years, I appreciate the challenges and unknowns that this new type of business can present.
 With our comprehensive plan for positive impact, industry-leading reputation, and operating experience, I know theory would be the premier choice for the City of Medford.
 I want to thank you all for your attention so far, and now I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan for the question and answer portion of the meeting.
 Thank you, and next slide.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2139.428s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Конечно.
 Спасибо, Джонатан.
 Я просто хочу поблагодарить Мэй за ваши добрые слова, и мы очень рады работать с вами и арт-сообществом над этим проектом.
 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2149.717s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Идеальный.
 Согласитесь на вопрос после Пэм Шенли.
 Здесь есть несколько вопросов, поэтому я прочитаю общую презентацию, а затем рассмотрю их один за другим.
 Здравствуйте, спасибо, что вы здесь, и спасибо за несколько вопросов, Пэм, член Catch Arts Group в Медфорде и жительница Медфорда.
 Во-первых, каковы основные отношения между диспансером и Medford Arts Group?
 Брэндон. Если вы хотите подвести итоги отношений, я знаю, что об этом уже упоминалось.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2185.371s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, мы будем играть важную роль как землевладелец, предоставив помещение и построив арт-центр именно так, как предлагает арт-партнер.
 У нас нет никакого контроля над деятельностью или участием, кроме владения в сообществе.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2211.02s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Идеальный.
 Следующий вопрос: могут ли они арендовать помещения для занятий искусством, представлений и вечеринок?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2218.666s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, действительно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2222.269s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Кто возглавит Medford Arts Group или они вольны делать все, что захотят, в пределах своих возможностей?
 Каковы эти потенциальные ограничения?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2231.896s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Поэтому я не могу много говорить об управлении арт-кооперативами с нашей точки зрения.
 Я имею в виду, что это некоммерческая организация, которая хорошо работает со всеми, кто там работает.
 По моему мнению, они вольны использовать то, что, по их мнению, лучше для сообщества.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2257.742s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Следующий вопрос короткий.
 Могу ли я использовать Wi-Fi?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2261.113s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: О, конечно.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2263.555s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Хорошо, все в порядке.
 Последние два.
 Искусство Когда художественная группа Медфорда сможет войти в здание?
 На этот раз в 24:07, да?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2275.425s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Это верно.
 Это верно.
 Она полностью отделена от аптеки, и они полностью контролируют частоту посещения людьми.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2285.853s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Идеальный.
 Последний вопрос касается парковки.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2289.263s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, перед Центром искусств будет обычная парковка и парковка, доступная ADA.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2296.666s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: ល្អណាស់ អរគុណ Brandon និងអរគុណ Pam ដែលបានដាក់សំណួររបស់អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​នឹង​ជួប​អ្នក​ក្នុង​សន្និសីទ​ដែរ ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​រីករាយ​ដែល​យើង​មាន​ឱកាស​ឆ្លើយ​សំណួរ​របស់​អ្នក។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់, សំណួរទីបីគឺមកពី Cindy Watson ។
 ការសិក្សាជាច្រើនបង្ហាញថាសិល្បៈអាចជួយសង្គ្រោះជីវិតមនុស្សបាន ប៉ុន្តែផ្ទុយទៅវិញវាក៏អាចសម្លាប់ជីវិតបានដែរ។
 កន្លែងសម្រាប់សិល្បៈ។
 កាលពីខែសីហាកន្លងទៅ លោកប្រធានាធិបតី Biden បានប្រកាសថា អនាគតរបស់យើងគឺនៅក្នុងវិស័យសិល្បៈ។
 វាគឺជាការបង្ហាញនៃព្រលឹងរបស់យើង។
 សេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍ដ៏ជ្រាលជ្រៅនេះគឺជាការព្រមានថា ត្រូវតែយកលុយពីថវិកាសហព័ន្ធ ដើម្បីផ្តល់មូលនិធិដល់សិល្បៈ និងវប្បធម៌។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​អាន​អត្ថបទ​នេះ​ដោយ​ប្រុង​ប្រយ័ត្ន ប៉ុន្តែ​សម្រាប់​តែ​កំណត់​ចំណាំ សម្រាប់​សំណួរ និង​ចម្លើយ និង​ដើម្បី​
 សម្រាប់ឱកាសក្នុងការនិយាយ ខ្ញុំនឹងព្យាយាមនិយាយបន្ថែមទៀតអំពីប្រធានបទនៃទ្រឹស្តីសុភមង្គល និងការចូលរួមរបស់វានៅក្នុងសហគមន៍។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះមតិយោបល់នៅទីនេះ និងសារនេះដែលយើងបានទទួល។
 ដូច្នេះ សេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍​ដ៏​ធំ​នេះ​ជាការ​ព្រមាន​អំពី​តម្រូវការ​ផ្លាស់ប្តូរ​ថវិកា​ពី​ថវិកា​សហព័ន្ធ​ទៅជា​សិល្បៈ និង​វប្បធម៌។
 បច្ចុប្បន្ន​នេះ សហរដ្ឋ​អាមេរិក​នៅ​ឆ្ងាយ​ពី​ដៃគូ​អឺរ៉ុប​របស់​ខ្លួន​ក្នុង​ការ​ផ្តល់​មូលនិធិ​ដល់​សិល្បៈ។
 គាត់និយាយបំផ្លើសតម្រូវការ។
 វិចិត្រករ​ជុំវិញ​ពិភពលោក​បាន​គាំទ្រ​គំនិត​នេះ ហើយ​បាន​បញ្ចេញ​សារ​ដ៏​គួរ​ឲ្យ​ចាប់អារម្មណ៍​នេះ។
 អស់រយៈពេល 15 ខែកន្លងមកនេះ អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំដឹងគឺការរំលេចនូវអ្វីដែលងងឹតបំផុត បង្កើតភាពរីករាយ ធ្វើល្អគ្រប់ឱកាស និងមើលឃើញភាពស្រស់ស្អាតជារៀងរាល់ថ្ងៃនៅក្នុងការងាររបស់សិល្បករដែលជឿថាវានឹងជួយយើងរកឃើញខ្លួនឯង។
 វាបានជួយខ្ញុំ ហើយប្រហែលជាវានឹងជួយអ្នកផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាសិល្បៈនឹងជួយយើងស៊ូទ្រាំនឹងការបាត់បង់នៅពេលដែលមហាសមុទ្រមិនអាចផ្ទុកការឈឺចាប់របស់យើង។
 ការផ្តល់ជូនល្អណាស់។
 មន្ទីរសុខាភិបាលទីក្រុងត្រូវបានកោតសរសើរចំពោះការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងរួមគ្នាជាមួយសហគមន៍សិល្បៈក្នុងការផ្តល់កន្លែងដែលត្រូវការច្រើន។
 ពួកគេទទួលស្គាល់តម្រូវការដើម្បីការពារបុព្វហេតុរបស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាកិច្ចសហប្រតិបត្តិការនេះនឹងក្លាយជាការពិត។
 គ្មានការសង្ស័យទេ វានឹងនាំមកនូវស្នាមញញឹមនៅលើមុខមនុស្សគ្រប់រូប ព្រោះវាជាភាសាសកល។
 ដូច្នេះ​សូម​អរគុណ Cindy ។
 ខ្ញុំក៏នឹងផ្តល់ឱកាសឱ្យ Brandon ឆ្លើយសំណួរនេះផងដែរ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2432.47s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, повтори, Джонатан.
 Спасибо
 Спасибо, Синди.
 Мы ценим ваши добрые слова и надеемся на сотрудничество.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2443.914s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Хорошо, следующий вопрос от Роберта Гарсиа.
 Босс воздушного шара не знает марку или нет, извините.
 Но кого это волнует, Theory Wellness — самая прибыльная компания по производству марихуаны в Массачусетсе.
 Они работают в Бриджуотере, Чикопи и Грейт-Баррингтоне более 4 лет.
 Это будет лучший партнер по финансированию марихуаны для Медфорда и налогоплательщиков США.
 Насколько я понимаю, они должны платить 3% от общей прибыли.
 Ни один кандидат не может к ним приблизиться.
 Так что мы можем.
 В этом нет никаких сомнений.
 Но я дам Брэндону шанс ответить еще раз.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2481.071s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, спасибо, Джонатан.
 Я так думаю, я думаю, что у него есть местный бизнес.
 Просто чтобы внести ясность с экономической точки зрения, мы будем делить 6% доходов, а не прибыли, тем самым предоставляя городу дополнительное финансирование, которое облегчит бремя для других налогоплательщиков и всего остального, что они примут.
 Поэтому мы действительно хотим помочь сообществу таким образом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2506.076s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Идеальный.
 Да, это от Сильвии Гарсиа.
 Я, Сильвия Гарсия, поддерживаю это.
 Ваша теория здоровья и приложение называют точку продажи марихуаны в приложении Mystery, потому что я видел ваш план, и здание выглядит потрясающе.
 В частности, мне нравится, что бизнес по производству марихуаны расположен в задней части здания, вдали от дороги и вне поля зрения, а в передней части здания будет зона, где не употребляют марихуану.
 Итак, это слово
 Сильвия живет в Медфорде.
 Я не буду публиковать его адрес, но он приехал как резидент, и мы это ценим.
 Брэндон, я дам тебе еще один шанс ответить.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2547.392s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Нет, мы ценим отзыв Сильвии.
 Спасибо за вашу поддержку.
 Мы полностью согласны, и, как вы упомянули, когда мы проводили комплексный опрос жителей Медфорда в начале этого года, мы ясно слышали, что люди хотят, чтобы взрослые курили, но они хотят делать это в тихом месте, и мы предлагаем здесь прекрасную возможность.
 Спасибо.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2570.233s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Спасибо, Брэндон.
 Это слово
 Мелисса Мигель, еще одна жительница Медфорда, я не хочу снова читать всю эту речь.
 Он написал городским властям: «Я пишу сегодня, чтобы выразить свою поддержку теории благосостояния и предлагаемому веб-сайту на Мистик-авеню в Южном Медфорде.
 Как давний житель Южного Медфорда, я имею удовольствие видеть ответственных партнеров по сообществу и ответственных партнеров по сообществу, ведущих бизнес в нашем сообществе.
 Они имеют долгую историю употребления марихуаны в Массачусетсе и очень обеспокоены безопасностью.
 Они обеспечивают круглосуточное наблюдение за вашей собственностью и гарантируют, что конфиденциальность частной собственности поблизости не будет нарушена.
 Медфорд проделал огромную работу по привлечению бизнеса в Южный Медфорд, и я надеюсь, что ситуация изменится с одобрения Центра молочного здоровья Mystic Avenue.
 Брэндон, я дам тебе еще одну возможность проявить себя.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2629.179s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Хорошо, мы ценим вашу поддержку, Мелисса.
 Мы искренне верим и согласны с вами, что наше присутствие по адресу 162 Mystic Ave повысит общую безопасность этого сообщества и приведет новых клиентов к другим местным предприятиям, которые будут делать покупки у нас.
 Эти клиенты обязательно посетят и наши соседние страны.
 Вот почему мы считаем, что это хорошо для делового сообщества Южного Медфорда.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2659.97s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Яркий
 Следующий вопрос от Джонатана Фэгана.
 Он поздоровался.
 Меня зовут Джонатан Фэган.
 Я член правления CATCH и основатель Медфордского джазового фестиваля.
 Я хотел бы еще раз заявить о своей поддержке Siri Wellness в преддверии сегодняшней встречи, тем более что они предлагают предоставить сообществу 10 000 квадратных футов арт-пространства, новую площадку, которая будет поддерживать платные представления и исполнительское искусство.
 Сыграл большую роль в возрождении арт-сообщества, особенно учитывая количество закрытых за последние месяцы мест.
 Выставка Mystic Avenue обеспечит столь необходимую известность, особенно для художников и других художников, которые хотят продемонстрировать свои работы более широкому сообществу.
 Пожалуйста, сообщите мне о встречах, о том, как это работает, и скажите, что еще я могу сделать, чтобы сделать Джонсона лучше.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2712.832s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо Джонатан.
 Мы ценим вашу щедрость и поддержку и очень приветствуем возможность предоставить пространство для искусства.
 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2728.183s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Идеальный.
 Согласитесь с последним вопросом Джессики Рубитико.
 Извините, если я ошибся.
 Я рад поддержать теорию Приятного Мистического Проспекта.
 Они усердно работали, чтобы привезти произведения искусства из Медфорда в свое место на Мистик-авеню.
 Искусству в Медфорде никогда не было места, и пришло время.
 Спасибо, Сири, мы любим тебя.
 Это от Джессики, она живет в Медфорде.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2759.583s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, спасибо, Джессика.
 Мы искренне благодарим вас за вашу поддержку и были бы очень счастливы и удачливы, если бы нам удалось продолжить этот проект и запустить центр искусств.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2771.817s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Да, спасибо, Брэндон.
 На этом вопрос, заданный ранее, завершается.
 Сейчас я перейду к разделу вопросов и ответов.
 Я просто хочу сказать, что участников было всего 18.
 Это от Бренды Бри.
 С какой художественной организацией Медфорда вы работаете?
 Думаю, мы еще раз подтвердим.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2793.761s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, эта организация называется Arts Collaborative.
 Это недавно созданная некоммерческая организация.
 Я знаю, что это сотрудничество нескольких художников из Медфорда, которые собрались вместе, чтобы помочь нам спроектировать пространство для арт-сообщества, поэтому технически они будут арендовать бесплатное теоретическое пространство.
 Итак, Arts Collaborative — это название художественной организации, с которой мы работаем.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2825.547s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Спасибо, Брэндон.
 Следующий вопрос... Хорошо, очень хорошо.
 Извините, это новая территория.
 Дэнни Леон спрашивает, сможет ли Брэндон доказать, что он владеет Temescal Wellness?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2847.619s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, я думаю... Я присоединился к компании в Нью-Гемпшире, некоммерческой организации под названием Temescal Wellness.
 Много лет назад.
 Я не владею, не управляю и не понимаю ничего, связанного с 10 Minute Health Massachusetts.
 Так что никакого богатства там нет.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2870.754s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Спасибо, Брэндон.
 Еще одна история от Дэна Леона, можете ли вы объяснить владельца Theory Farms?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2881.58s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Итак, Theory Farms — это проект, начатый мной и несколькими другими основателями Theory, и все началось несколько лет назад, когда он получил временную лицензию.
 Мы так и не продолжили проект и фактически аннулировали разрешение.
 Поэтому я не знаю, кто в настоящее время владеет Theory Farms, но полагаю, что они поменяют свое название на другое, когда получат лицензию.
 Но нас сейчас не интересуют теоретические фермы.
 Хорошо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2913.761s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Спасибо, Брендан.
 Последний вопрос и ответ исходила от Бренды Дых.
 Как разделена парковка между аптекой и арт-пространством?
 Всем ли найдется место?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2925.963s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, я думаю, когда мы завершим местный план и план развития посредством арт-сотрудничества, мы сможем больше поговорить о том, как мы хотим управлять парковкой.
 Хм, конечно, да, я это знаю, почему это то, что заранее известно как парковка.
 И если у них будет более крупное мероприятие, я думаю, мы хотим сотрудничать с командой руководства нашей аптеки, чтобы быть уверенными, что мы готовы к нему справиться.
 В случае крупных мероприятий, если это может повлиять на нашу собственную деятельность, мы можем использовать парковку на территории для решения этой проблемы, и вы знаете, мы можем использовать это в случае необходимости, например, заставив наших сотрудников парковаться на улице на день или более.
 Но учитывая, что на территории имеется 59 парковочных мест, я совершенно уверен, что у нас не возникнет проблем с парковкой, и мы будем полностью готовы к тому, чтобы каждый мог быстро и легко найти место.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2981.528s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Идеальный.
 Спасибо, Брэндон.
 Я больше не вижу вопросов в разделе вопросов и ответов чата Zoom и продолжу к тем, кто поднимет руки.
 Поэтому я пошел к Кену Краузе.
 Кен, мы разрешим тебе включить микрофон и видео, если хочешь.
 Так что да.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3002.521s">[Krause]</a>: Ты слышишь меня?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3003.862s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: В.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3004.522s">[Krause]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Да, Кен Краузе.
 Прожил в Медфорде 21 год.
 За это время я стал активно сотрудничать с художественными и экологическими организациями.
 Я в восторге от предвкушения Центра искусств, вершины вашей почти 15-летней неустанной работы в арт-сообществе.
 Медфордское художественное сотрудничество
 Я жил там несколько лет и смотрел некоторые места.
 Это очень интересно.
 Мне также приятно, что отель уделяет особое внимание устойчивому развитию.
 Итак, у меня есть два вопроса.
 Первый
 Наверное, самый короткий ответ.
 Что касается строительства этого объекта недвижимости, я не вижу деревьев на представленной короткой фотографии.
 На Мистик-авеню, как правило, острая нехватка зелени, и мне интересно, есть ли у вас какие-либо ландшафтные планы, чтобы посмотреть, есть ли в этом потенциал, или вы планируете добавить зелень на это место.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3066.07s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, спасибо, Кен.
 Это Брэндон.
 Я могу ответить на этот вопрос
 Прежде всего, спасибо за вашу поддержку и уважение к искусству.
 Ник и я, основатели теории, глубоко заботимся об устойчивости и ценим идею древесного покрова.
 Наш проект по ландшафтному дизайну еще не завершен, так что я действительно могу подумать
 Я думаю, что мы определенно хотим большего.
 Добавьте его в пейзаж.
 Знаете, есть некоторые возражения.
 С точки зрения безопасности мы не хотим выключать наши камеры или что-то в этом роде, но в некоторых частях сайта может использоваться древесный покров, чтобы добавить тень.
 Так что я думаю, что это хороший момент.
 Хорошей новостью является то, что мы еще не завершили проект сада.
 Так что мы определенно можем это принять во внимание.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3109.836s">[Krause]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Мой второй вопрос: я обсуждал это с людьми из спасательного сообщества, и они очень заинтересованы в том, чтобы иметь возможность легко поддерживать центр искусств и посещать там мероприятия, а также, возможно, иметь там студию.
 Их опасения связаны с верой в то, что они могут жить комфортно.
 Посетите локацию возле аптеки позади нее.
 Вы упомянули что-то о совершенно отдельном сайте, что я считаю важным, а также о строгой политике неиспользования этого сайта.
 Интересно, можно ли подробнее рассказать об обустройстве закрытого пространства и есть ли общее пространство?
 Есть ли отдельный вход?
 Есть ли какие-либо другие детали, которые могут помочь нам понять, как эти две сущности работают по отдельности?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3183.104s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо, Кен.
 Это очень хороший вопрос.
 Некоторые моменты, требующие ответа.
 Поначалу это были совершенно разные помещения, между ними могло быть пустое пространство для хранения, но на самом деле не было возможности получить доступ к какому-либо другому пространству.
 Вход также полностью независимый.
 Кроме того, теперь у нас есть аптека, и со временем мы действительно научились гарантировать
 Бизнес работает подсознательно, как розничный магазин, поэтому обычный человек может не знать, что мы делаем, если только он не придет к нам за марихуаной.
 Например, магазин не будет источать неприятные запахи, поскольку все товары запечатываются и предварительно упаковываются перед прибытием на место.
 Знаете, у нас нет больших бутылок с пробами, марихуаны и тому подобного.
 В этом смысле это очень профессионально и необдуманно.
 Это также относится к нашему плану веб-сайта.
 Так что внешний вид нашего здания действительно делает это место красивым, но мы не делаем то, что делаем, ярко.
 Марихуана не уходит.
 Нет яркого неонового света.
 Он очень профессиональный и внимательный.
 Я полностью понимаю эти опасения, и они действительно устоялись.
 Лучше всего, когда мы сотрудничаем в искусстве
 Если возникает проблема, мы быстро обсуждаем, как решить и улучшить проблему или конфликтную точку, чтобы каждый получил максимальную отдачу от партнерства.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3286.031s">[Krause]</a>: Большое спасибо.
 Удачи</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3288.373s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3293.357s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Все хорошо.
 Я позабочусь о том, чтобы наступил май.
 Марк Блейк, пожалуйста, еще раз прости меня за мое произношение.
 Привет Мэг.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3307.686s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: Сделайте объезд.
 Да, я просто хочу поблагодарить вас за ваше сегодняшнее выступление.
 Это очень полезно.
 Мой вопрос: я не уверен: где будет расти растение марихуаны?
 На площадке или за ее пределами?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3331.624s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, это хороший вопрос, Мэй.
 Спасибо, что задали этот вопрос.
 Таким образом, мы являемся компанией вертикальной интеграции, которая позволяет нам получать выгоду от выращивания собственных растений марихуаны.
 Итак, мы делаем это в двух местах за пределами Медфорда, штат Массачусетс.
 Так что марихуана не будет процветать в Медфорде.
 Мы выросли в доме.
 Итак, у нас есть крытая ферма в Бриджуотере и ферма по выращиванию марихуаны под открытым небом в Шеффилде, Беркшир.
 Затем продукт сушат, проверяют, упаковывают и отправляют дистрибьюторам, но на объекте нет завода.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3373.481s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: Спасибо, Брэндон.
 Я просто хочу сказать, насколько важно, чтобы у Медфорда и арт-сообщества наконец появился дом.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3385.426s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Спасибо
 Мы ждем этого.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3395.974s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Я опущу твои руки.
 Если у вас есть дополнительные вопросы, задайте их еще раз.
 Хороший следующий вопрос, но я вижу Лорел С. Поэтому я выведу вас из режима активации.
 Итак, Лорел.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3409.425s">[Laurel Siegel]</a>: Привет
 Я Лорел Сигел, нынешний президент Medford Arts Collaborative.
 Я также являюсь президентом CACHE и просто хочу поговорить с Arts Partnership, если смогу.
 В результате у нас есть члены Медфордского совета искусств CACHE и Медфордской школы искусств, а также другие заинтересованные стороны художественного сообщества.
 Именно поэтому мы привносим богатый опыт и знания в арт-сообщество Медфорда.
 Главное, что я хочу сказать: я хочу воспользоваться этой возможностью, спасибо Теории за эту возможность.
 Я думаю, что это прекрасная возможность для арт-сообщества Медфорда.
 Я ценю вашу щедрость и профессионализм при отправке нам запроса.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3458.059s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Спасибо, Лорел.
 Мы ценим вашу поддержку и надеемся на продолжение сотрудничества с вами и другими арт-партнерами.
 Так что еще раз спасибо.
 Спасибо</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3470.322s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Спасибо, Лорел.
 Извините, я только что почувствовал запах.
 Тогда у Кена есть еще один вопрос.
 Я верну Кена.
 Верно?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3493.12s">[Krause]</a>: Спасибо
 Ну, ко мне пришел еще один вопрос.
 Я не видел исследования трафика, о котором вы упомянули.
 Сюда входит движение грузовиков на территорию и за ее пределы, а также транспорт и другие возможности.
 Будете ли вы получать транспорт туда и обратно или сделаете это полностью сами?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3521.245s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Да, конечно.
 Действительно хороший вопрос, Кен.
 Напоминаем нашим зрителям: обычно мы приносим извинения за то, что сказали, что Медфорд разместил на городском веб-сайте полную программу для всех заявителей в больницу Медфорд, включая копию нашего плана доставки.
 Но в основном,
 Ответ, связанный с транспортом, заключается в том, что мы будем доставлять в Медфорд только один автомобиль несколько раз в неделю.
 Так что существенного влияния на трафик это не окажет.
 Это автомобили Форд Транзит.
 Это не 18 колеса.
 Мне бы хотелось, чтобы мы были заняты, но мы не могли.
 Они перевозят марихуану один или два раза в неделю.
 Не отправляйте из Медфорда.
 Поэтому будут осуществляться только входящие раздачи.
 По неосторожности, не в рабочее время, в любое время суток.
 Таким образом, перемещение всего лишь нескольких автомобилей в неделю не окажет существенного влияния на движение транспорта.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3588.006s">[Krause]</a>: Хорошо, спасибо.
 Я пытался скачать приложение, но оно весит около 108 МБ.
 Вот почему это так скучно.
 Это слишком много для моего маленького компьютера.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3600.131s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Нет, он очень старый
 Но мы много думали над нашим предложением.
 Я думаю, что это действительно способ оценить длину этого предложения.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3612.856s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Спасибо, Кен.
 Ссылку на участника удалю.
 Ну, других вопросов в Q&A у меня нет и роста другой руки я не вижу.
 Дэни вовремя
 Дэнни Леоне Вы международный оператор MSO?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3635.709s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Таким образом, наш бренд Theory Wellness также работает в штате Мэн.
 Однако в контексте данного предложения Theory Wellness Incorporated мы являемся компанией, базирующейся в Массачусетсе и только в Массачусетсе.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3655.418s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Хорошо, отлично.
 Это в прямом эфире.
 О, я тоже смотрю вопросы и ответы.
 Я также проверяю темы участников, чтобы узнать, поднял ли кто-нибудь руку.
 В данный момент я ничего не вижу.
 Я думаю, что у нас будет последний звонок.
 Контактная информация также доступна, если есть какие-либо вопросы.
 Ты знаешь, что думать.
 Я знаю, что они отправили электронное письмо, чтобы связаться с ними, и я уверен, что они будут открыты для любого разговора, который состоится после сегодняшней встречи.
 Итак, есть ли вопросы у желающих пообщаться или присоединиться к чату?
 Спасибо
 Я получил копию от Кена.
 Кен Краузе спрашивает: Можете ли вы рассказать нам следующий шаг в процессе отбора?
 Я думаю, это для Медфорда, а не штата.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3713.547s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: В Медфорде, конечно, есть Консультативный комитет по каннабису, созданный несколькими чиновниками из Медфорда.
 В настоящее время они оценивают это предложение и выбирают трех ключевых кандидатов, чтобы представить мэру так называемое Соглашение о дружбе с сообществом, что является следующим шагом в этом процессе.
 Мы понимаем, что до сих пор обсуждалось, что рекомендация будет окончательно доработана к концу августа и что мэр может немедленно достичь соглашения с принимающим сообществом.
 Если нам повезет выбрать, мы сможем подать заявку на государственную лицензию, получить специальное разрешение от ЗБА и подготовиться к строительству клиник и арт-центров.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3772.758s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Спасибо, Брэндон.
 Ладно, я сделаю последний звонок.
 Кен написал в разделе вопросов и ответов.
 Спасибо
 Так что, если у кого-то возникнут дополнительные вопросы, я приостановлю последний звонок примерно на минуту.
 Но я думаю, что сейчас мы просто хотим сказать спасибо всем, кто слушал, комментировал или задавал вопросы.
 Это конструктивный диалог сообщества
 Важно сохранять и поддерживать сильный характер сообщества.
 Спасибо всем, что нашли время присоединиться к нам.
 Если у вас есть дополнительные вопросы, свяжитесь с кандидатом по адресу электронной почты, указанному на главном экране.
 Это сообщество emorywellness.org.
 Я хотел бы еще раз проверить ссылку «Вопросы и ответы» и ссылку участника, чтобы узнать, есть ли еще один последний вопрос, которого я здесь не увидел.
 Еще раз спасибо, Брэндон.
 Я пришлю его вам, если вы захотите его снять.
 Скажем одно последнее слово.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3832.568s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Не совсем, спасибо, Джонатан.
 Спасибо всем за интерес и участие в этой встрече.
 Мы с нетерпением ждем возможности стать здесь частью сообщества Медфорда.
 Мы стремимся по-настоящему управлять аптекой мирового класса, которая приносит пользу обществу во многих важных отношениях.
 Как упомянул Джонатан, если у вас есть какие-либо идеи, свяжитесь с нами.
 У нас действительно открытая политика, и мы с нетерпением ждем возможности обсудить и обсудить любые вопросы, которые могут возникнуть у людей по поводу нашего предложения.
 Желаю всем приятного вечера и еще раз спасибо, что пришли.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3871.666s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Всем спасибо и спокойной ночи.</p>
