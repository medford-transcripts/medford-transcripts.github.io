    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=601.659s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome everyone to our community outreach meeting.
 It is a privilege to be able to discuss our plans with you all this evening, and I very much look forward to the chance to answer your questions and respond to your comments later on in the meeting.
 As a bit of background, I am one of the founders of Theory Wellness, a local cannabis organization that is headquartered in Stoneham.
 We were founded in 2015 and our mission is to create the highest quality dispensary experience for our local communities, our customers, and our employees.
 We have a long and successful track record of operating compliant, safe, and community-centric dispensaries in the Commonwealth, and now employ approximately 300 talented team members here in Massachusetts, providing living wages and a comprehensive benefit package, including a 401k plan.
 We are well known as one of the most respected cannabis organizations in the state, routinely meeting with a variety of cannabis industry stakeholders and regulators to help improve how legal cannabis works here in Massachusetts.
 We take our responsibility to operate as industry leaders very seriously and would be honored to bring our world-class operations to Medford.
 Our first dispensary is a medical only facility that we opened in Bridgewater in 2017.
 We have since then grown to operate two other dispensaries in Massachusetts, one in Chicopee and one in Great Barrington, both of which serve medical patients and adult use customers.
 The Great Barrington location was one of the first recreational stores to open in the state, and that was in January of 2019.
 So this has given us over two years of experience, which is very helpful here in Medford, on how to operate these businesses successfully.
 Thierry also operates indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities and manufactures a wide variety of products.
 In sum, we operate 10 different cannabis licenses here in Massachusetts, which is equal or more to any operational experience of any other business in the state.
 Having at this point served over 1 million different customers in Massachusetts, we look forward to bringing our extensive experience and track record to our South Medford neighborhood.
 Next slide, please.
 After that as well, please.
 So community is very important for us at Theory.
 And that's one of the unique aspects on how we run our business is our approach to community relations.
 We believe the relationship begins by being good listeners, understanding the concerns and desires from all the stakeholders in the community.
 From day one, Theory has listened to and worked closely with our communities to develop positive working relationships that extend from government officials to local businesses, to grassroots organizations, and most importantly, local residents.
 Theory was one of the first cannabis companies in the state to develop a host community agreement, working with the town of Bridgewater since 2016 to share a portion of our revenue with the town to support their municipal programming.
 Since then, Theory has contributed over $8 million in direct financial contributions to our host communities.
 Beyond hiring locally and providing significant economic stimulus, we have focused on building long-term collaborative relationships with municipal governments, as well as local community organizations.
 We have launched an educational series on cannabis, sponsored numerous charitable events, hosted food and clothing drives, and supported over 20 nonprofits in our local communities.
 We look forward to continue on this path with our new project here in Medford.
 Next slide, please.
 So this slide is an overview of our site plan.
 We're proposing a marijuana retailer to be located at 162 Mystic Avenue.
 The site is currently vacant and was previously used as a car dealership.
 Our proposal is to completely renovate and beautify not just the building, but the entire site.
 We searched for over a year to find the perfect location for a dispensary and are extremely happy to be proposing a location at 162 Mystic Ave for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed throughout the presentation.
 These reasons include first and foremost parking.
 This site includes 59 parking stalls with the site plan that you're looking at right now, which is critical to ensure that no traffic issues arise and that we have no nuisance to our neighborhood.
 Number two, the details of the site are pretty unique.
 As shown in the site plan, we have selected a building that has enough space to not just house a dispensary, but also donate 10,000 square feet of space to the arts community, which we will look forward to providing more information on in the upcoming slides.
 Another key benefit of this proposal is that we are able to develop the dispensary in the rear of the building, ensuring that the dispensary is discreetly featured on Mystic Avenue and not front and center.
 Earlier this year, we commissioned a poll of over 250 Medford residents, and it was clear that the majority of residents preferred a dispensary to be discreetly cited like this proposal and not prominently on a main road.
 Next slide, please.
 In respect to zoning compliance, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, Medford has a zoning ordinance that designates the C2 and industrial zones as the two areas in the city where an adult-use dispensary can operate.
 This use is subject to obtaining a special permit from the Zoning Board of Affairs, and there are not regulations from the local health board pertaining to dispensaries.
 That being said, theory has proposed a comprehensive plan to monitor local health impacts and looks forward to working with the Medford Health Department to safely operate our business.
 Our site at 162 Mystic Ave is in the C2 district and is in full compliance with the city's zoning ordinance.
 Importantly, we are over 500 feet away from any K through 12 schools, as shown as a diagram here.
 We have already fully designed our site and construction plans and look forward to working with local builders and contractors when we are ready to construct our facility.
 Renderings of our exterior and interior are provided on the following slides.
 Next slide, please.
 Perfect.
 So this is the proposed exterior of the dispensary.
 As you can see, we, you know, are renovating the entire site and really beautifying the exterior of the building.
 Next slide.
 The proposed interior rendering is where we create a welcoming, bright, and safe environment for our guests.
 Next slide.
 So now we're going to talk about a very interesting partnership we have here with the arts community in Medford.
 A core value of ours, and one of the primary reasons of our success to date, is our steadfast commitment to contributing in meaningful ways to the communities that we operate in.
 In Medford, we are extremely excited and fortunate to be proposing a variety of ways in which we will expect to benefit the community.
 First and foremost, we have established a tremendous partnership with the arts community in Medford.
 For the last six months, we have had discussions with local leaders in the arts community and learned that despite good efforts and intentions, the arts community in Medford has never been able to find a home.
 That will all change with Theory Medford.
 We have committed to donating 10,000 square feet of our building to the Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that will help manage this brand new arts center.
 In addition to providing the space free of charge, Theory will completely renovate the space to the specifications necessary to provide this community benefit.
 This will create studio space, meeting space, office space, and performing space for the arts.
 Our architect has already been working on preliminary floor plans as mentioned on this slide and we couldn't be happier with the partnership and if all goes to plan we would have the community art center up and running in early 2022.
 Next slide.
 Theory understands that diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity are necessary foundational pillars in building a strong team that represents the communities we operate in and facilitates the creation of a value-driven organization.
 Theory also recognizes how the war on drugs disproportionately affected certain communities of color.
 As leaders in the cannabis industry, we have a real responsibility to lead by example, create positive change, and foster opportunities for generational wealth creation for those who have been negatively affected by the unjust historical policies.
 To that end, in 2019 theory launched a first of its kind social equity program, providing $250,000 in no strings attached zero interest financing.
 In addition to resources training and coaching to an economic empowerment applicant who is in the process of launching their own dispensary.
 After interviewing around a dozen qualified applicants, in July of 2019, Theory selected entrepreneurs Vanessa Jean Baptiste and Mark Bouquet of Legal Greens to be the first participants in our program.
 Legal Greens is comprised of these two business partners, both Black, one being a woman, who grew up and reside in neighborhoods that were adversely affected by the war on drugs.
 After nearly two years, in March 2021, Legal Greens opened their recreational dispensary in Brockton, becoming the first Black-owned
 woman-owned recreational dispensary on the East Coast.
 We're very proud of the team at Legal Greens and look forward to replicating this program in Medford if we're fortunate enough to continue on with our project here.
 Additionally, Theory is committed to hiring a diverse workforce in Medford.
 We truly believe that our people is what allows our company to be most successful and that diversity is an asset to any organization.
 proven to foster improved decision-making, increased innovation, stronger customer relationships, and increased employee engagement.
 In Medford, Theory has worked closely with the Mystic branch of the NAACP on a comprehensive diversity hiring plan.
 We are committed to creating a workforce that is at least 50% women, 35% diverse, and 5% veteran, with this goal extending through all management positions.
 Theory offers terrific advancement opportunities and goes through great lengths in our recruitment process to ensure we are hiring without bias or discrimination.
 Next slide, please.
 A major driver of our positive impact in Medford will be economic.
 First, we plan on hiring over 60 well-paid full-time individuals with a mandate that the workforce is diverse and local.
 Specifically, at least 75% of our employees will be Medford residents.
 All team members are provided comprehensive benefits, which include a 401k plan.
 We're especially proud to offer this 401k plan, which right now is not very common in the cannabis industry due to the challenges in working with finding a provider for a program like that.
 As the number one retailer in Massachusetts, we are confident in our projections that each year our Medford dispensary will provide the city with over $2 million in direct cash contributions through both tax revenue and our community host agreement.
 In addition to the commitments to donate to the arts community, Theory has also allocated $50,000 per year to support local nonprofits.
 This is consistent with our track record as we have already support dozens of nonprofits throughout the state.
 Next slide, please.
 We acknowledge and appreciate that one of the possible negative impacts from an adult use dispensary is localized traffic condition.
 In order to meet the economic development goals of the city while simultaneously avoiding any traffic congestion problems, an operator must carefully choose a location that is suitable to handle a high volume of customers.
 There are very few properties within the permitted zones in Medford that provide easy access, have sufficient parking, contain good interior space, and would not materially impact localized traffic.
 This is something that we took very seriously and we're well qualified to analyze having years of experience citing and operating high traffic retail dispensers.
 After looking at dozens of options in Medford for our proposed site, we committed to 162 Mystic Avenue based on a number of factors, including and importantly, the site's ability to serve our projected number of customer visits per day from an access parking and favorable traffic impact perspective.
 Our location is a former car dealership located two minutes off 93 with 59 parking stalls, significantly more than what our projected daily customer visits would demand as further detailed below.
 By comparison, in Great Barrington and Chicopee, where we also operate recreational dispensaries, our location served between 600 and over 1,000 customers per day on busy days with less parking capacity and have had zero material traffic issues to date.
 To demonstrate the suitability of our proposed location, Theory engaged a professional traffic engineering and analysis firm to perform a comprehensive traffic study.
 This 27-page traffic study concluded that our operation of a marijuana retailer at 162 Mystic Avenue would not negatively impact traffic on Mystic Ave.
 Furthermore, as we have done at our other locations, we will work closely with the Medford Police Department to ensure we have a comprehensive traffic control plan in place, including police details as necessary for the initial opening period.
 Next slide, please.
 Our track record and experience showcase that our operational plans and staff training will lead to the safe operations of a marijuana retailer in Medford, including ensuring that diversion and underage sales do not take place at our location.
 We have served over 1 million customers in Massachusetts without any underage sales.
 We check identification three times, once at the door, once in the reception room, and again at the sales counter.
 Furthermore, we use a machine called ID Science that scans each identification for validity.
 This equipment is also used in casinos and updates itself every 30 days with a
 comprehensive database of all valid forms of state ID across the country, as well as all passports in the world.
 By using this machine, we have caught hundreds of expired or invalid forms of identification at our other locations.
 All of our products are secured in the vault, which has extensive security features.
 We are also constantly monitoring our parking areas and have a zero tolerance policy for consumption of cannabis on site.
 Any customers that are found to be consuming on site would be permanently banned from returning to our location.
 Next slide, please.
 An important aspect to discuss is the safety and security that will be designed and implemented at our dispensary.
 It is first helpful to acknowledge and appreciate that Theory has served over a million customers with an excellent safety and security track record.
 And in our other communities, we maintain direct lines of communication with our local law enforcement partners, whom have written letters of recommendation, calling Theory a model for others to follow.
 Our comprehensive safety and security plan would first be reviewed with the Medford Police Department prior to being finalized.
 We always look forward to receiving feedback and improving our plan based on conversations with law enforcement professionals.
 At all times during operational hours, Theory has a highly trained safety and security team that works both inside and outside the dispensary.
 They are there to ensure that no prohibited activities take place on our premise.
 In large part due to our terrific safety and security team, we have not had any nuisance complaints about unsavory customer activity from any of our neighbors at our existing locations.
 Moreover, the dispensary will be outfitted with an extensive alarm and video monitoring system using the most modern technology available.
 This technology is a cornerstone of our safety and security plan and allows us to offer both a welcoming and safe environment for our guests and our neighbors.
 Next slide, please.
 Theory is committed to leading the cannabis industry by taking meaningful measures towards achieving a more sustainable future, despite the level of short-term investment it may require.
 Sustainability is a fundamental value at Theory, woven into our decision-making on a daily basis.
 To date, we have invested millions in energy-reductive technology, effectively offsetting over 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year by moving 90% of our cannabis cultivation operations outdoors, and have greened the majority of our energy usage by purchasing over 85% of our energy from renewable sources.
 Our plan for Medford will push our sustainability actions even further.
 We have a 79-point sustainability action plan consisting of bold measures, including the installation of 263 solar panels on our roof, pledging to electrify our vehicles, obtaining 100% of our company-wide energy needs from renewables, purchasing carbon offsets, sourcing from and supporting local businesses, installing electric vehicle charging stations, incentivizing public transportation,
 using sustainable design and building materials, and sponsoring green entrepreneurship in the city of Medford.
 To hold ourselves accountable, we will establish a director of sustainability and engage with third party consultants to audit our dispensary on a periodic basis.
 Theory admires and respects the City of Medford's ambitious goals relating to sustainability and energy efficiency and believes our operation will align with and contribute meaningfully towards a shared mission.
 We look forward to being a corporate steward and a contributing member of the Medford community.
 Next slide, please.
 Over the years, Thierry has spent extensive time in the Medford community to understand the concerns and desires of Medford residents and businesses relating to the siting and operation of a marijuana retailer.
 Thierry undertook an independent survey of over 250 Medford residents and incorporated their feedback into our proposal, ensuring that our location, our charitable initiatives, and our hiring plans serve the community best.
 Additionally, we have forged a remarkable relationship with local arts community to design, construct, and provide free ongoing use of a 10,000 square foot community center for the arts, a landmark partnership of historic value.
 Thierry has spoken extensively with hundreds of abutters, local businesses, local leaders, and residents, and received tremendous support, evidenced by the over 60 local letters of support that we've received from a variety of locations as shown in the map on this slide.
 To ensure our local relationship only continues to strengthen, Thierry will be hiring a full-time director of community relations whose primary responsibility is fostering and strengthening the quality of our relationship with the community.
 This individual will be based in Medford and will serve as the day-to-day face of Thierry and a conduit for our community relations.
 This is beyond attending and participating in meetings and community events relating to our business.
 They'll also be managing our charitable budget for local nonprofits.
 Next slide, please.
 So to sum it up, I am confident that Theory is the most qualified applicant to operate in Medford for a couple of reasons.
 First, we have the experience necessary to ensure our dispensary in Medford will be world-class.
 We have an industry-leading track record of success and safety at our other operations in Great Barrington, Chicopee, and Bridgewater.
 We have served over 1 million guests without incident, while maintaining a 99 percentile customer rating.
 We have become a model company to our regulators, our host communities, and our customers.
 We have demonstrated that we know exactly how to operate a world-class cannabis dispensary.
 Second, we have an ambitious, progressive, and well-thought-out plan for positive community impacts here in Medford.
 We have created an incredible partnership with the arts community to construct and donate a brand new 10,000 square feet center for the arts, a first-of-its-kind program for the city.
 Moreover, we will be providing over 60 well-paying jobs with full benefits in 401k, supporting local businesses and non-profits, financing local entrepreneurs and social equity applicants, and contributing to the sustainability and diversity goals of the City.
 From a pure economic perspective, we will contribute over $2 million per year to the city in direct payments, amounts we have shown to provide to our other communities.
 Third, after years of scouting, we have carefully chosen a location that we believe makes an ideal site for a dispensary from an infrastructure, traffic, and security standpoint.
 Moreover, our location reflects the desires and priorities of the local community.
 Our location at 162 Mystic Avenue is discreet, has tremendous parking, is located in a C2 district away from residential, and will be completely revitalized through our site beautification plan.
 Having been on the forefront of the industry for years, I appreciate the challenges and unknowns that this new type of business can present.
 With our comprehensive plan for positive impact, industry-leading reputation, and operating experience, I know theory would be the premier choice for the City of Medford.
 I want to thank you all for your attention so far, and now I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan for the question and answer portion of the meeting.
 Thank you, and next slide.

 그는 Pam Shanley의 안부를 물어보기로 동의했습니다.
 여기에는 많은 문제가 있으므로 전체 프레젠테이션을 읽고 하나씩 해결하겠습니다.
 안녕하세요, 여기 와주셔서 감사하고 몇 가지 질문을 해주셔서 감사합니다. Pam, Medford 거주자이자 Catch Arts 그룹 멤버입니다.
 첫째, 진료소와 Medford Arts Collection의 주요 관계는 무엇입니까?
 브랜든. 관계를 평가하고 싶다면 이것이 이미 언급되었다는 것을 알고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2185.371s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 네, 저희는 아트파트너가 제안하는 대로 공간을 제공하고 아트센터를 건립하여 토지주로서 중요한 역할을 하도록 하겠습니다.
 우리는 커뮤니티 소유권 이외의 활동이나 참여에 대해 통제권을 갖지 않습니다.</p>

 다음 질문: 미술 수업, 공연, 파티를 위해 공간을 빌릴 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2218.666s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 예.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2222.269s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Medford Arts Group을 누가 이끌 것인가, 아니면 그들은 능력 내에서 원하는 것을 자유롭게 할 수 있습니까?
 이러한 잠재적인 한계는 무엇입니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2231.896s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 그러므로 우리 입장에서는 예술협동조합의 운영에 대해 많은 말씀을 드릴 수가 없습니다.
 내 말은, 그곳에서 일하는 모든 사람에게 잘 돌아가는 비영리 조직이라는 거죠.
 제 생각에는 그들은 사회에 가장 좋다고 생각하는 것을 자유롭게 사용할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2257.742s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 다음 질문은 짧습니다.
 Wi-Fi를 사용할 수 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2261.113s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 아, 물론이죠.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2263.555s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 알았어, 괜찮아.
 마지막 두 개.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2275.425s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.

 마지막 질문은 주차에 관한 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2289.263s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 예, 예술 센터 앞에 일반 및 ADA 이용 가능 주차장이 있습니다.</p>

 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​នឹង​ជួប​អ្នក​ក្នុង​សន្និសីទ​ដែរ ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​រីករាយ​ដែល​យើង​មាន​ឱកាស​ឆ្លើយ​សំណួរ​របស់​អ្នក។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់, សំណួរទីបីគឺមកពី Cindy Watson ។
 ការសិក្សាជាច្រើនបង្ហាញថាសិល្បៈអាចជួយសង្គ្រោះជីវិតមនុស្សបាន ប៉ុន្តែផ្ទុយទៅវិញវាក៏អាចសម្លាប់ជីវិតបានដែរ។
 កន្លែងសម្រាប់សិល្បៈ។
 កាលពីខែសីហាកន្លងទៅ លោកប្រធានាធិបតី Biden បានប្រកាសថា អនាគតរបស់យើងគឺនៅក្នុងវិស័យសិល្បៈ។
 វាគឺជាការបង្ហាញនៃព្រលឹងរបស់យើង។
 សេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍ដ៏ជ្រាលជ្រៅនេះគឺជាការព្រមានថា ត្រូវតែយកលុយពីថវិកាសហព័ន្ធ ដើម្បីផ្តល់មូលនិធិដល់សិល្បៈ និងវប្បធម៌។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​អាន​អត្ថបទ​នេះ​ដោយ​ប្រុង​ប្រយ័ត្ន ប៉ុន្តែ​សម្រាប់​តែ​កំណត់​ចំណាំ សម្រាប់​សំណួរ និង​ចម្លើយ និង​ដើម្បី​
 សម្រាប់ឱកាសក្នុងការនិយាយ ខ្ញុំនឹងព្យាយាមនិយាយបន្ថែមទៀតអំពីប្រធានបទនៃទ្រឹស្តីសុភមង្គល និងការចូលរួមរបស់វានៅក្នុងសហគមន៍។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះមតិយោបល់នៅទីនេះ និងសារនេះដែលយើងបានទទួល។
 ដូច្នេះ សេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍​ដ៏​ធំ​នេះ​ជាការ​ព្រមាន​អំពី​តម្រូវការ​ផ្លាស់ប្តូរ​ថវិកា​ពី​ថវិកា​សហព័ន្ធ​ទៅជា​សិល្បៈ និង​វប្បធម៌។
 បច្ចុប្បន្ន​នេះ សហរដ្ឋ​អាមេរិក​នៅ​ឆ្ងាយ​ពី​ដៃគូ​អឺរ៉ុប​របស់​ខ្លួន​ក្នុង​ការ​ផ្តល់​មូលនិធិ​ដល់​សិល្បៈ។
 គាត់និយាយបំផ្លើសតម្រូវការ។
 វិចិត្រករ​ជុំវិញ​ពិភពលោក​បាន​គាំទ្រ​គំនិត​នេះ ហើយ​បាន​បញ្ចេញ​សារ​ដ៏​គួរ​ឲ្យ​ចាប់អារម្មណ៍​នេះ។
 អស់រយៈពេល 15 ខែកន្លងមកនេះ អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំដឹងគឺការរំលេចនូវអ្វីដែលងងឹតបំផុត បង្កើតភាពរីករាយ ធ្វើល្អគ្រប់ឱកាស និងមើលឃើញភាពស្រស់ស្អាតជារៀងរាល់ថ្ងៃនៅក្នុងការងាររបស់សិល្បករដែលជឿថាវានឹងជួយយើងរកឃើញខ្លួនឯង។
 វាបានជួយខ្ញុំ ហើយប្រហែលជាវានឹងជួយអ្នកផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាសិល្បៈនឹងជួយយើងស៊ូទ្រាំនឹងការបាត់បង់នៅពេលដែលមហាសមុទ្រមិនអាចផ្ទុកការឈឺចាប់របស់យើង។
 ការផ្តល់ជូនល្អណាស់។
 មន្ទីរសុខាភិបាលទីក្រុងត្រូវបានកោតសរសើរចំពោះការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងរួមគ្នាជាមួយសហគមន៍សិល្បៈក្នុងការផ្តល់កន្លែងដែលត្រូវការច្រើន។
 ពួកគេទទួលស្គាល់តម្រូវការដើម្បីការពារបុព្វហេតុរបស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាកិច្ចសហប្រតិបត្តិការនេះនឹងក្លាយជាការពិត។
 គ្មានការសង្ស័យទេ វានឹងនាំមកនូវស្នាមញញឹមនៅលើមុខមនុស្សគ្រប់រូប ព្រោះវាជាភាសាសកល។
 ដូច្នេះ​សូម​អរគុណ Cindy ។
 ខ្ញុំក៏នឹងផ្តល់ឱកាសឱ្យ Brandon ឆ្លើយសំណួរនេះផងដែរ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2432.47s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 응, 다시 말해봐, 조나단.
 감사합니다
 고마워요, 신디.
 귀하의 친절한 말씀에 감사드리며 귀하와 함께 일할 수 있기를 기대합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2443.914s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 알겠습니다. 다음 질문은 Robert Garcia님입니다.
 벌룬헤드는 브랜드를 모르고, 죄송합니다.
 하지만 누가 신경쓰겠어요? Theory Wellness는 매사추세츠에서 가장 수익성이 높은 마리화나 회사입니다.
 그들은 4년 넘게 Bridgewater, Chicopee 및 Great Barrington에 서비스를 제공해 왔습니다.
 이는 Medford와 미국 납세자들을 위한 최고의 마리화나 자금 조달 파트너가 될 것입니다.
 내가 아는 한 그들은 총 이익의 3%를 지불해야 합니다.
 어떤 후보자도 그들에게 접근할 수 없습니다.
 그래서 우리는 할 수 있습니다.
 그것에 대해서는 의심의 여지가 없습니다.
 하지만 Brandon에게 다시 대답할 기회를 주겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2481.071s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 네, 고마워요, 조나단.
 내 생각에는 그 사람이 지역 사업을 하고 있는 것 같아요.
 경제적으로 명확하게 하기 위해 우리는 이익이 아닌 수입의 6%를 공유하여 다른 납세자들과 그들이 수용하는 모든 것에 대한 부담을 완화할 추가 자금을 시에 제공할 것입니다.
 그래서 우리는 이런 방식으로 지역사회를 돕고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2506.076s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 이상적인.
 네, 실비아 가르시아가 보낸 거예요.
 나 실비아 가르시아는 이를 지지한다.
 귀하의 계획을 봤고 건물이 멋져 보였기 때문에 귀하의 건강 이론과 응용 프로그램이 Mystery App의 마리화나 약국에 연결되었습니다.
 특히, 마리화나 판매점을 건물 뒤쪽, 눈에 띄지 않는 곳에 위치시키고, 건물 앞쪽에 마리화나 금지 구역을 마련한 점이 마음에 듭니다.
 그러니까 이 말이지
 실비아는 메드포드에 산다.
 나는 그의 주소를 공개하지 않을 것이지만 그는 주민으로 들어왔고 우리는 그것에 대해 감사하고 있습니다.
 브랜든, 다시 한 번 답변할 기회를 드리겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2547.392s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 아니요, Sylvia의 의견에 감사드립니다.
 귀하의 지원에 감사드립니다.
 우리는 귀하의 의견에 전적으로 동의하며 귀하가 언급한 대로 올해 초 메드포드 주민을 대상으로 종합적인 조사를 실시했을 때 사람들은 어른들이 담배를 피우기를 원하지만 조용한 곳에서 담배를 피우기를 원한다는 것을 분명히 들었고 우리는 여기서 좋은 기회를 제공합니다.
 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2570.233s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 고마워요 브랜든.
 이것은 단어입니다
 메드포드의 또 다른 주민인 멜리사 미구엘(Melissa Miguel) 저는 편지 전체를 다시 읽고 싶지 않습니다.
 “저는 오늘 제안된 복지 이론과 사우스 메드퍼드의 미스틱 스트리트에 있는 웹사이트에 대한 지지를 표명하기 위해 글을 쓰고 있습니다.”라고 그는 시 공무원들에게 썼습니다.
 South Medford의 오랜 거주자로서 저는 책임감 있는 지역사회 파트너와 책임감 있는 지역사회 파트너가 우리 지역사회에서 사업을 수행하는 모습을 보게 되어 기쁩니다.
 그들은 매사추세츠에서 오랫동안 마리화나를 사용해 왔으며 안전에 대해 매우 우려하고 있습니다.
 이들은 귀하의 재산을 연중무휴 24시간 모니터링하고 근처 사유 재산의 개인정보가 침해되지 않도록 보장합니다.
 Medford는 South Medford에 사업체를 유치하는 데 훌륭한 성과를 거두었으며 Mystic Avenue Dairy Health Center의 승인으로 이러한 상황이 바뀌기를 바랍니다.
 브랜든, 당신에게 자신을 증명할 또 다른 기회를 주겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2629.179s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 당신의 지지에 감사드립니다, 멜리사.
 우리는 162 Mystic Ave에서의 우리 존재가 이 지역 사회의 전반적인 안전을 향상시키고 우리와 함께 쇼핑할 다른 지역 사업체에 새로운 고객을 유치할 것이라고 진심으로 믿고 동의합니다.
 이 고객들은 반드시 이웃 국가를 방문할 것입니다.
 이것이 바로 우리가 이것이 South Medford 비즈니스 커뮤니티에 좋은 일이라고 생각하는 이유입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2659.97s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 브라이트
 다음 질문은 Jonathan Fagan의 질문입니다.
 그는 인사했다.
 제 이름은 조나단 페이건입니다.
 저는 CATCH 이사회 회원이자 Medford Jazz Festival의 창립자입니다.
 오늘 회의에 앞서 Siri Wellness에 대한 지지를 거듭 강조하고 싶습니다. 특히 유료 공연과 공연 예술을 지원하는 새로운 장소인 10,000평방피트의 예술 공간을 지역 사회에 제공하겠다고 제안한 Siri Wellness에 대한 지지를 다시 한번 강조하고 싶습니다.
 그는 특히 최근 몇 달 동안 문을 닫은 공연장 수를 고려하면 예술계를 활성화하는 데 큰 역할을 했습니다.
 Mystic Avenue 갤러리는 특히 자신의 작품을 더 넓은 커뮤니티에 선보이고 싶어하는 예술가와 기타 예술가들에게 절실히 필요한 노출을 제공할 것입니다.
 회의와 진행 방식에 대해 알려주고 Johnson을 개선하기 위해 제가 할 수 있는 일이 무엇인지 알려주세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2712.832s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 네, 고마워요 조나단.
 여러분의 관대함과 지원에 감사드리며, 예술을 위한 공간을 제공할 수 있는 기회를 진심으로 환영합니다.
 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2728.183s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 이상적인.
 Jessica Robetico의 마지막 질문에 동의합니다.
 내가 틀렸다면 죄송합니다.
 나는 Pleasant Mystic Avenue 이론을 지지하게 되어 기쁘게 생각합니다.
 그들은 Medford의 예술 작품을 Mystic Avenue의 위치로 가져오기 위해 열심히 노력했습니다.
 메드퍼드에는 예술이 설 자리가 없었고, 이제 때가 왔습니다.
 감사합니다 Siri, 사랑해요.
 이건 메드포드에 사는 제시카가 보낸 거예요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2759.583s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 네, 고마워요, 제시카.
 여러분의 성원에 진심으로 감사드리며, 이 프로젝트를 계속해서 아트센터를 운영할 수 있다면 매우 기쁘고 행운이 있을 것입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2771.817s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 네, 고마워요, 브랜든.
 이것으로 아까 했던 질문을 마칩니다.
 이제 질문과 답변 섹션으로 이동하겠습니다.
 단지 18명의 참가자가 있었다고 말하고 싶습니다.
 브렌다 브레이(Brenda Brey)가 보낸 메시지입니다.
 어떤 메드퍼드 예술 단체와 협력하고 있나요?
 다시 한번 확인해 보도록 하겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2793.761s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 예, 이 조직은 Arts Collaborative라고 합니다.
 새로 창설된 비영리단체입니다.
 나는 이것이 예술 공동체를 위한 공간 디자인을 돕기 위해 함께 모인 여러 ​​메드포드 예술가들의 협력이라는 것을 알고 있으므로 기술적으로 그들은 무료 이론적 공간을 임대할 것입니다.
 그래서 Arts Collaborative는 우리가 함께 일하는 예술 단체의 이름입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2825.547s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 고마워요 브랜든.
 다음 질문... 좋아요, 아주 좋아요.
 죄송합니다. 이곳은 새로운 영역입니다.
 Danny Leon은 Brandon이 자신이 Temescal Wellness를 소유하고 있음을 증명할 수 있는지 묻습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2847.619s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 네, 아마도... 저는 뉴햄프셔에 있는 Temescal Wellness라는 비영리 단체에 입사했습니다.
 수년 전.
 나는 10 Minute Health Massachusetts와 관련된 어떠한 것도 소유, 운영 또는 이해하지 않습니다.
 그래서 거기에는 부가 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2870.754s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 고마워요 브랜든.
 Dan Lyon의 또 다른 이야기입니다. Theory Farms의 소유자가 누구인지 설명해 주시겠습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2881.58s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 그래서 Theory Farms는 저와 몇몇 Theory 창립자들에 의해 시작된 프로젝트입니다. 이 모든 것은 몇 년 전 임시 라이선스를 받았을 때 시작되었습니다.
 우리는 프로젝트를 계속하지 않았고 실제로 허가를 취소했습니다.
 그래서 현재 Theory Farms의 소유자가 누구인지는 모르지만 라이센스를 받으면 이름을 다른 이름으로 변경할 것이라고 가정합니다.
 그러나 우리는 이제 이론적인 농장에는 관심이 없습니다.
 괜찮은</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2913.761s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 고마워요, 브렌든.
 마지막 질문과 답변은 Brenda Deitch가 맡았습니다.
 약국과 예술공간의 주차공간은 어떻게 구분되나요?
 모두를 위한 공간이 있나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2925.963s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 네, 일단 지역 계획과 TCP 개발 계획이 확정되면 주차 관리 방법에 대해 더 이야기할 수 있을 것 같습니다.
 물론 그렇습니다. 이전에 주차장으로 알려진 이유가 무엇인지 알고 있습니다.
 그리고 대규모 행사가 있을 경우 약국 관리팀과 협력하여 이를 처리할 준비가 되었는지 확인하고 싶습니다.
 대규모 행사의 경우 운영에 영향을 미칠 수 있는 경우 현장 주차장을 사용하여 해당 문제를 해결할 수 있으며, 필요한 경우 직원을 하루 이상 거리에 두는 등 필요한 경우 이를 사용할 수 있습니다.
 하지만 현장에 59개의 주차 공간이 있기 때문에 주차 문제가 없을 것이라고 확신하며 모든 사람이 빠르고 쉽게 주차 공간을 확보할 수 있도록 만반의 준비를 갖추겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2981.528s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 이상적인.
 고마워요 브랜든.
 Zoom 채팅의 Q&A 섹션에 더 이상 질문이 표시되지 않으며 손을 드는 분들을 위해 계속됩니다.
 그래서 Ken Krause에게 갔습니다.
 켄, 원하시면 마이크와 비디오를 켜도록 할게요.
 그렇습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3002.521s">[Krause]</a>: 내 말 들려?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3003.862s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 안에.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3004.522s">[Krause]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 네, 켄 크라우스.
 그는 메드퍼드에서 21년 동안 살았습니다.
 이 기간 동안 그녀는 예술 및 환경 단체에 적극적으로 참여했습니다.
 저는 예술계에서 거의 15년간의 노력의 정점인 예술 센터의 전망이 매우 기대됩니다.
 메드퍼드 아트 콜라보레이션
 나는 그곳에서 몇 년 동안 살면서 몇몇 곳을 살펴보았습니다.
 이것은 매우 흥미롭습니다.
 또한 호텔이 지속 가능성에 중점을 두고 있다는 점이 기쁩니다.
 그래서 두 가지 질문이 있습니다.
 첫째로
 아마도 가장 짧은 대답 일 것입니다.
 이 부동산의 건설과 관련하여 제공된 삽화에는 나무가 전혀 보이지 않습니다.
 미스틱 스트리트는 녹지가 매우 부족한 편인데 혹시 조경 계획이 있는지, 아니면 녹지 공간을 추가할 계획이 있는지 궁금합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3066.07s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 응, 고마워, 켄.
 브랜든이에요.
 나는 이 질문에 답할 수 있다
 먼저, 예술에 대한 여러분의 지지와 존중에 감사드립니다.
 Theory의 창립자인 Nick과 저는 지속 가능성에 깊은 관심을 갖고 있으며 나무 덮개에 대한 아이디어를 소중히 여깁니다.
 우리 조경 프로젝트가 아직 끝나지 않아서 정말 생각할 수 있어요
 나는 우리가 확실히 더 많은 것을 원한다고 생각합니다.
 풍경에 추가해보세요.
 몇 가지 이의가 있습니다.
 안전의 관점에서 우리는 카메라나 그와 유사한 것을 끄고 싶지 않지만 사이트의 일부에서는 그늘을 추가하기 위해 나무 덮개를 사용할 수 있습니다.
 그래서 나는 그것이 좋은 지적이라고 생각합니다.
 좋은 소식은 정원 프로젝트가 아직 끝나지 않았다는 것입니다.
 그래서 우리는 그것을 확실히 고려할 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3109.836s">[Krause]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 두 번째 질문은 구조 커뮤니티 사람들과 이 문제에 대해 논의해 왔는데 그들은 아트 센터를 쉽게 지원하고 그곳의 행사에 참석하며 심지어 그곳에 스튜디오를 가질 수도 있다는 점에 매우 관심이 있다는 것입니다.
 그들의 두려움은 편안하게 살 수 있다는 믿음에서 비롯됩니다.
 그 뒤에 있는 약국 근처에 있는 곳을 방문하세요.
 제가 중요하다고 생각하는 완전히 별개의 사이트와 해당 사이트에 대한 엄격한 사용 금지 정책에 대해 언급하셨습니다.
 밀폐된 공간의 배치와 공유 공간이 있는지 좀 더 자세히 알려주실 수 있으신가요?
 입구가 따로 있나요?
 이 두 엔터티가 별도로 작동하는 방식을 이해하는 데 도움이 될 수 있는 다른 세부 정보가 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3183.104s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 고마워요, 켄.
 이것은 매우 좋은 질문입니다.
 답변이 필요한 몇 가지 사항.
 처음에는 완전히 분리된 방이었고, 그 사이에 빈 수납공간이 있을 수도 있지만 실제로는 다른 공간으로 접근할 수 있는 방법이 없었습니다.
 입구도 완전히 독립되어 있습니다.
 게다가, 우리는 이제 약국을 갖게 되었고, 시간이 지나면서 우리는 보장하는 방법을 실제로 배웠습니다.
 이 사업은 소매점처럼 무의식적으로 운영되기 때문에 일반 사람들은 마리화나를 사러 오지 않는 이상 우리가 무엇을 하는지 모를 수도 있습니다.
 예를 들어, 모든 제품은 현장 도착 전 밀봉 및 사전 포장되기 때문에 매장에서는 불쾌한 냄새가 나지 않습니다.
 아시다시피, 우리는 큰 샘플병이나 마리화나 같은 건 없어요.
 그런 의미에서 그것은 매우 전문적이고 사려 깊습니다.
 이는 당사 웹사이트 계획에도 적용됩니다.
 그래서 우리 건물의 모습은 그 장소를 아름답게 만들지만, 우리가 하는 일을 화려하게 만들지는 않습니다.
 마리화나는 사라지지 않습니다.
 밝은 네온 불빛이 없습니다.
 그는 매우 전문적이고 세심합니다.
 나는 이러한 우려를 완전히 이해하며 잘 확립되어 있습니다.
 우리는 예술 분야에서 협력하는 것이 좋습니다
 문제가 발생하면 문제나 갈등 지점을 해결하고 개선하는 방법을 신속하게 논의하여 모두가 파트너십을 최대한 활용할 수 있도록 합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3286.031s">[Krause]</a>: 매우 감사합니다.
 행운을 빌어요</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3288.373s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3293.357s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 모든 것이 괜찮습니다.
 5월은 꼭 오도록 할게요.
 마크 블레이크님, 제 발음을 다시 한 번 용서해주세요.
 안녕 멕.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3307.686s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: 차례를 취하십시오.
 네, 오늘 말씀해주셔서 감사하다는 말씀을 전하고 싶습니다.
 이것은 매우 유용합니다
 내 질문: 잘 모르겠습니다. 마리화나 식물은 어디에서 자랄까요?
 경기장 안팎?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3331.624s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 네, 좋은 질문이에요, 메이.
 이 질문을 해주셔서 감사합니다.
 따라서 우리는 자체적으로 마리화나 식물을 재배하여 이익을 얻을 수 있는 수직 통합 회사입니다.
 그래서 우리는 매사추세츠 주 메드퍼드 외곽의 두 곳에서 이를 수행합니다.
 따라서 마리화나는 메드퍼드에서 번성하지 않을 것입니다.
 우리는 집에서 자랐습니다.
 그래서 우리는 브리지워터(Bridgwater)에 실내 농장을 갖고 있고 버크셔주 셰필드(Sheffield)에 야외 대마초 농장을 갖고 있습니다.
 그 후 제품을 건조, 검사, 포장하여 유통업체에 배송하지만 현장 공장은 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3373.481s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: 고마워요 브랜든.
 저는 메드포드와 예술계가 마침내 집을 갖는 것이 얼마나 중요한지 말하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3385.426s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 감사합니다
 우리는 이것을 기다리고 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3395.974s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 손을 내려 놓겠습니다.
 추가 문의사항이 있으시면 다시 질문해 주세요.
 다음 질문은 좋지만 Laurel S가 보입니다. 그러면 활성화 모드를 종료하겠습니다.
 그럼, 로렐.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3409.425s">[Laurel Siegel]</a>: 안녕하세요
 저는 현재 Medford Arts Collaborative의 회장인 Laurel Siegel입니다.
 저는 CACHE의 회장이기도 하며 가능하다면 Arts Partnership과 이야기를 나누고 싶습니다.
 그 결과, 우리는 Medford Arts Council CACHE와 Medford School of the Arts의 회원뿐만 아니라 예술계의 다른 이해관계자들을 보유하고 있습니다.
 이것이 바로 우리가 Medford의 예술 커뮤니티에 풍부한 경험과 지식을 제공하는 이유입니다.
 내가 말하고 싶은 가장 중요한 것은 이 기회를 활용하고 싶다는 것입니다. 이 기회를 주신 Theory에게 감사드립니다.
 저는 이것이 메드포드의 예술 커뮤니티를 위한 좋은 기회라고 생각합니다.
 귀하의 요청을 보내주신 귀하의 관대함과 전문성에 감사드립니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3458.059s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 고마워요, 로렐.
 귀하의 지원에 감사드리며 귀하 및 다른 예술 파트너와 계속해서 협력하기를 기대합니다.

 감사합니다</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3470.322s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 고마워요, 로렐.
 죄송해요. 냄새만 맡았어요.
 그러면 Ken은 또 다른 질문을 합니다.
 내가 켄을 다시 데려올게요.
 오른쪽?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3493.12s">[Krause]</a>: 감사합니다
 글쎄, 또 다른 질문이 나에게 왔습니다.
 나는 당신이 언급한 교통 연구를 본 적이 없습니다.
 여기에는 기타 운송 수단 및 기능 외에도 해당 지역 안팎으로 트럭의 이동이 포함됩니다.
 왕복 셔틀을 받으시겠습니까, 아니면 전적으로 직접 하시겠습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3521.245s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 물론이죠.
 정말 좋은 질문이에요, 켄.
 시청자 여러분께 다시 한 번 말씀드리지만, Medford가 전달 계획 사본을 포함하여 Medford Hospital의 모든 지원자를 위한 전체 프로그램을 시 웹사이트에 게시했다는 점에 대해 전반적으로 사과드립니다.
 하지만 대부분
 교통에 대한 답변은 일주일에 몇 번만 Medford에 차량 한 대만 배달한다는 것입니다.
 따라서 이는 교통에 큰 영향을 미치지 않습니다.
 포드 트랜짓 차량들입니다.
 이것은 18개의 바퀴가 아닙니다.
 우리가 바빴으면 좋았을 텐데 그렇지 않았어요.
 그들은 일주일에 한두 번 마리화나를 운송합니다.
 Medford에서는 배송되지 않습니다.
 따라서 들어오는 배포만 실행됩니다.
 업무시간 중이 아닌, 하루 중 언제든지 과실로 인한 경우.
 따라서 일주일에 몇 대의 자동차를 이동하는 것은 교통 흐름에 큰 영향을 미치지 않습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3588.006s">[Krause]</a>: 좋아요, 고마워요.
 앱을 다운받아봤는데 108MB 정도네요.
 그래서 너무 지루합니다.
 내 작은 컴퓨터에는 너무 많은 것 같습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3600.131s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 아니요, 그 사람은 늙었어요
 그러나 우리는 우리의 제안에 많은 생각을 했습니다.
 제 생각에는 이것이 바로 이 문장의 길이를 판단하는 방법이라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3612.856s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: 고마워요 켄.
 해당 게시물 링크는 삭제하겠습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3635.709s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 그래서 우리의 Theory Wellness 브랜드는 메인주에서도 운영됩니다.
 그러나 이 프레젠테이션의 목적에 따라 Theory Wellness Incorporated는 매사추세츠에 본사를 둔 기업이며 매사추세츠에 본사를 둔 기업일 뿐입니다.</p>

 또한 참가자의 스레드를 스캔하여 손을 든 사람이 있는지 확인합니다.
 지금은 아무것도 볼 수 없습니다.
 내 생각엔 우리가 마지막 결정을 내릴 것 같아.
 질문이 있는 경우 연락처 정보도 제공됩니다.
 당신은 무엇을 생각해야할지 알고 있습니다.
 나는 그들이 그들에게 연락하기 위해 이메일을 보낸 것을 알고 있으며 그들이 오늘 회의 이후에 일어나는 모든 대화에 열려 있을 것이라고 확신합니다.
 그렇다면 채팅에 관심이 있거나 채팅에 참여하는 데 질문이 있는 사람이 있나요?
 감사합니다
 Ken에게서 사본을 받았습니다.
 Ken Krause가 묻습니다. 선택 과정의 다음 단계가 무엇인지 알려주실 수 있나요?
 나는 이것이 주를 위한 것이 아니라 메드포드를 위한 것이라고 생각합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3713.547s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: 물론 Medford에는 여러 Medford 관계자가 만든 대마초 자문위원회가 있습니다.
 그들은 현재 제안을 평가하고 다음 단계인 소위 지역사회 친화적인 합의안을 시장에게 제출하기 위해 세 명의 유력 후보를 선정하고 있습니다.
 우리는 지금까지 논의가 8월 말까지 권고안이 마무리될 것이며 시장이 즉시 호스트 커뮤니티와 합의에 도달할 수도 있다는 점을 알고 있습니다.
 운이 좋게 선발되면 주 면허를 신청하고, ZBA로부터 특별 허가를 받고, 진료소와 예술 센터 건립을 준비할 수 있습니다.</p>
