    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=601.659s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>:  Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome everyone to our community outreach meeting.
 It is a privilege to be able to discuss our plans with you all this evening, and I very much look forward to the chance to answer your questions and respond to your comments later on in the meeting.
 As a bit of background, I am one of the founders of Theory Wellness, a local cannabis organization that is headquartered in Stoneham.
 We were founded in 2015 and our mission is to create the highest quality dispensary experience for our local communities, our customers, and our employees.
 We have a long and successful track record of operating compliant, safe, and community-centric dispensaries in the Commonwealth, and now employ approximately 300 talented team members here in Massachusetts, providing living wages and a comprehensive benefit package, including a 401k plan.
 We are well known as one of the most respected cannabis organizations in the state, routinely meeting with a variety of cannabis industry stakeholders and regulators to help improve how legal cannabis works here in Massachusetts.
 We take our responsibility to operate as industry leaders very seriously and would be honored to bring our world-class operations to Medford.
 Our first dispensary is a medical only facility that we opened in Bridgewater in 2017.
 We have since then grown to operate two other dispensaries in Massachusetts, one in Chicopee and one in Great Barrington, both of which serve medical patients and adult use customers.
 The Great Barrington location was one of the first recreational stores to open in the state, and that was in January of 2019.
 So this has given us over two years of experience, which is very helpful here in Medford, on how to operate these businesses successfully.
 Thierry also operates indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities and manufactures a wide variety of products.
 In sum, we operate 10 different cannabis licenses here in Massachusetts, which is equal or more to any operational experience of any other business in the state.
 Having at this point served over 1 million different customers in Massachusetts, we look forward to bringing our extensive experience and track record to our South Medford neighborhood.
 Next slide, please.
 After that as well, please.
 So community is very important for us at Theory.
 And that's one of the unique aspects on how we run our business is our approach to community relations.
 We believe the relationship begins by being good listeners, understanding the concerns and desires from all the stakeholders in the community.
 From day one, Theory has listened to and worked closely with our communities to develop positive working relationships that extend from government officials to local businesses, to grassroots organizations, and most importantly, local residents.
 Theory was one of the first cannabis companies in the state to develop a host community agreement, working with the town of Bridgewater since 2016 to share a portion of our revenue with the town to support their municipal programming.
 Since then, Theory has contributed over $8 million in direct financial contributions to our host communities.
 Beyond hiring locally and providing significant economic stimulus, we have focused on building long-term collaborative relationships with municipal governments, as well as local community organizations.
 We have launched an educational series on cannabis, sponsored numerous charitable events, hosted food and clothing drives, and supported over 20 nonprofits in our local communities.
 We look forward to continue on this path with our new project here in Medford.
 Next slide, please.
 So this slide is an overview of our site plan.
 We're proposing a marijuana retailer to be located at 162 Mystic Avenue.
 The site is currently vacant and was previously used as a car dealership.
 Our proposal is to completely renovate and beautify not just the building, but the entire site.
 We searched for over a year to find the perfect location for a dispensary and are extremely happy to be proposing a location at 162 Mystic Ave for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed throughout the presentation.
 These reasons include first and foremost parking.
 This site includes 59 parking stalls with the site plan that you're looking at right now, which is critical to ensure that no traffic issues arise and that we have no nuisance to our neighborhood.
 Number two, the details of the site are pretty unique.
 As shown in the site plan, we have selected a building that has enough space to not just house a dispensary, but also donate 10,000 square feet of space to the arts community, which we will look forward to providing more information on in the upcoming slides.
 Another key benefit of this proposal is that we are able to develop the dispensary in the rear of the building, ensuring that the dispensary is discreetly featured on Mystic Avenue and not front and center.
 Earlier this year, we commissioned a poll of over 250 Medford residents, and it was clear that the majority of residents preferred a dispensary to be discreetly cited like this proposal and not prominently on a main road.
 Next slide, please.
 In respect to zoning compliance, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, Medford has a zoning ordinance that designates the C2 and industrial zones as the two areas in the city where an adult-use dispensary can operate.
 This use is subject to obtaining a special permit from the Zoning Board of Affairs, and there are not regulations from the local health board pertaining to dispensaries.
 That being said, theory has proposed a comprehensive plan to monitor local health impacts and looks forward to working with the Medford Health Department to safely operate our business.
 Our site at 162 Mystic Ave is in the C2 district and is in full compliance with the city's zoning ordinance.
 Importantly, we are over 500 feet away from any K through 12 schools, as shown as a diagram here.
 We have already fully designed our site and construction plans and look forward to working with local builders and contractors when we are ready to construct our facility.
 Renderings of our exterior and interior are provided on the following slides.
 Next slide, please.
 Perfect.
 So this is the proposed exterior of the dispensary.
 As you can see, we, you know, are renovating the entire site and really beautifying the exterior of the building.
 Next slide.
 The proposed interior rendering is where we create a welcoming, bright, and safe environment for our guests.
 Next slide.
 So now we're going to talk about a very interesting partnership we have here with the arts community in Medford.
 A core value of ours, and one of the primary reasons of our success to date, is our steadfast commitment to contributing in meaningful ways to the communities that we operate in.
 In Medford, we are extremely excited and fortunate to be proposing a variety of ways in which we will expect to benefit the community.
 First and foremost, we have established a tremendous partnership with the arts community in Medford.
 For the last six months, we have had discussions with local leaders in the arts community and learned that despite good efforts and intentions, the arts community in Medford has never been able to find a home.
 That will all change with Theory Medford.
 We have committed to donating 10,000 square feet of our building to the Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that will help manage this brand new arts center.
 In addition to providing the space free of charge, Theory will completely renovate the space to the specifications necessary to provide this community benefit.
 This will create studio space, meeting space, office space, and performing space for the arts.
 Our architect has already been working on preliminary floor plans as mentioned on this slide and we couldn't be happier with the partnership and if all goes to plan we would have the community art center up and running in early 2022.
 Next slide.
 Theory understands that diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity are necessary foundational pillars in building a strong team that represents the communities we operate in and facilitates the creation of a value-driven organization.
 Theory also recognizes how the war on drugs disproportionately affected certain communities of color.
 As leaders in the cannabis industry, we have a real responsibility to lead by example, create positive change, and foster opportunities for generational wealth creation for those who have been negatively affected by the unjust historical policies.
 To that end, in 2019 theory launched a first of its kind social equity program, providing $250,000 in no strings attached zero interest financing.
 In addition to resources training and coaching to an economic empowerment applicant who is in the process of launching their own dispensary.
 After interviewing around a dozen qualified applicants, in July of 2019, Theory selected entrepreneurs Vanessa Jean Baptiste and Mark Bouquet of Legal Greens to be the first participants in our program.
 Legal Greens is comprised of these two business partners, both Black, one being a woman, who grew up and reside in neighborhoods that were adversely affected by the war on drugs.
 After nearly two years, in March 2021, Legal Greens opened their recreational dispensary in Brockton, becoming the first Black-owned
 woman-owned recreational dispensary on the East Coast.
 We're very proud of the team at Legal Greens and look forward to replicating this program in Medford if we're fortunate enough to continue on with our project here.
 Additionally, Theory is committed to hiring a diverse workforce in Medford.
 We truly believe that our people is what allows our company to be most successful and that diversity is an asset to any organization.
 proven to foster improved decision-making, increased innovation, stronger customer relationships, and increased employee engagement.
 In Medford, Theory has worked closely with the Mystic branch of the NAACP on a comprehensive diversity hiring plan.
 We are committed to creating a workforce that is at least 50% women, 35% diverse, and 5% veteran, with this goal extending through all management positions.
 Theory offers terrific advancement opportunities and goes through great lengths in our recruitment process to ensure we are hiring without bias or discrimination.
 Next slide, please.
 A major driver of our positive impact in Medford will be economic.
 First, we plan on hiring over 60 well-paid full-time individuals with a mandate that the workforce is diverse and local.
 Specifically, at least 75% of our employees will be Medford residents.
 All team members are provided comprehensive benefits, which include a 401k plan.
 We're especially proud to offer this 401k plan, which right now is not very common in the cannabis industry due to the challenges in working with finding a provider for a program like that.
 As the number one retailer in Massachusetts, we are confident in our projections that each year our Medford dispensary will provide the city with over $2 million in direct cash contributions through both tax revenue and our community host agreement.
 In addition to the commitments to donate to the arts community, Theory has also allocated $50,000 per year to support local nonprofits.
 This is consistent with our track record as we have already support dozens of nonprofits throughout the state.
 Next slide, please.
 We acknowledge and appreciate that one of the possible negative impacts from an adult use dispensary is localized traffic condition.
 In order to meet the economic development goals of the city while simultaneously avoiding any traffic congestion problems, an operator must carefully choose a location that is suitable to handle a high volume of customers.
 There are very few properties within the permitted zones in Medford that provide easy access, have sufficient parking, contain good interior space, and would not materially impact localized traffic.
 This is something that we took very seriously and we're well qualified to analyze having years of experience citing and operating high traffic retail dispensers.
 After looking at dozens of options in Medford for our proposed site, we committed to 162 Mystic Avenue based on a number of factors, including and importantly, the site's ability to serve our projected number of customer visits per day from an access parking and favorable traffic impact perspective.
 Our location is a former car dealership located two minutes off 93 with 59 parking stalls, significantly more than what our projected daily customer visits would demand as further detailed below.
 By comparison, in Great Barrington and Chicopee, where we also operate recreational dispensaries, our location served between 600 and over 1,000 customers per day on busy days with less parking capacity and have had zero material traffic issues to date.
 To demonstrate the suitability of our proposed location, Theory engaged a professional traffic engineering and analysis firm to perform a comprehensive traffic study.
 This 27-page traffic study concluded that our operation of a marijuana retailer at 162 Mystic Avenue would not negatively impact traffic on Mystic Ave.
 Furthermore, as we have done at our other locations, we will work closely with the Medford Police Department to ensure we have a comprehensive traffic control plan in place, including police details as necessary for the initial opening period.
 Next slide, please.
 Our track record and experience showcase that our operational plans and staff training will lead to the safe operations of a marijuana retailer in Medford, including ensuring that diversion and underage sales do not take place at our location.
 We have served over 1 million customers in Massachusetts without any underage sales.
 We check identification three times, once at the door, once in the reception room, and again at the sales counter.
 Furthermore, we use a machine called ID Science that scans each identification for validity.
 This equipment is also used in casinos and updates itself every 30 days with a
 comprehensive database of all valid forms of state ID across the country, as well as all passports in the world.
 By using this machine, we have caught hundreds of expired or invalid forms of identification at our other locations.
 All of our products are secured in the vault, which has extensive security features.
 We are also constantly monitoring our parking areas and have a zero tolerance policy for consumption of cannabis on site.
 Any customers that are found to be consuming on site would be permanently banned from returning to our location.
 Next slide, please.
 An important aspect to discuss is the safety and security that will be designed and implemented at our dispensary.
 It is first helpful to acknowledge and appreciate that Theory has served over a million customers with an excellent safety and security track record.
 And in our other communities, we maintain direct lines of communication with our local law enforcement partners, whom have written letters of recommendation, calling Theory a model for others to follow.
 Our comprehensive safety and security plan would first be reviewed with the Medford Police Department prior to being finalized.
 We always look forward to receiving feedback and improving our plan based on conversations with law enforcement professionals.
 At all times during operational hours, Theory has a highly trained safety and security team that works both inside and outside the dispensary.
 They are there to ensure that no prohibited activities take place on our premise.
 In large part due to our terrific safety and security team, we have not had any nuisance complaints about unsavory customer activity from any of our neighbors at our existing locations.
 Moreover, the dispensary will be outfitted with an extensive alarm and video monitoring system using the most modern technology available.
 This technology is a cornerstone of our safety and security plan and allows us to offer both a welcoming and safe environment for our guests and our neighbors.
 Next slide, please.
 Theory is committed to leading the cannabis industry by taking meaningful measures towards achieving a more sustainable future, despite the level of short-term investment it may require.
 Sustainability is a fundamental value at Theory, woven into our decision-making on a daily basis.
 To date, we have invested millions in energy-reductive technology, effectively offsetting over 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year by moving 90% of our cannabis cultivation operations outdoors, and have greened the majority of our energy usage by purchasing over 85% of our energy from renewable sources.
 Our plan for Medford will push our sustainability actions even further.
 We have a 79-point sustainability action plan consisting of bold measures, including the installation of 263 solar panels on our roof, pledging to electrify our vehicles, obtaining 100% of our company-wide energy needs from renewables, purchasing carbon offsets, sourcing from and supporting local businesses, installing electric vehicle charging stations, incentivizing public transportation,
 using sustainable design and building materials, and sponsoring green entrepreneurship in the city of Medford.
 To hold ourselves accountable, we will establish a director of sustainability and engage with third party consultants to audit our dispensary on a periodic basis.
 Theory admires and respects the City of Medford's ambitious goals relating to sustainability and energy efficiency and believes our operation will align with and contribute meaningfully towards a shared mission.
 We look forward to being a corporate steward and a contributing member of the Medford community.
 Next slide, please.
 Over the years, Thierry has spent extensive time in the Medford community to understand the concerns and desires of Medford residents and businesses relating to the siting and operation of a marijuana retailer.
 Thierry undertook an independent survey of over 250 Medford residents and incorporated their feedback into our proposal, ensuring that our location, our charitable initiatives, and our hiring plans serve the community best.
 Additionally, we have forged a remarkable relationship with local arts community to design, construct, and provide free ongoing use of a 10,000 square foot community center for the arts, a landmark partnership of historic value.
 Thierry has spoken extensively with hundreds of abutters, local businesses, local leaders, and residents, and received tremendous support, evidenced by the over 60 local letters of support that we've received from a variety of locations as shown in the map on this slide.
 To ensure our local relationship only continues to strengthen, Thierry will be hiring a full-time director of community relations whose primary responsibility is fostering and strengthening the quality of our relationship with the community.
 This individual will be based in Medford and will serve as the day-to-day face of Thierry and a conduit for our community relations.
 This is beyond attending and participating in meetings and community events relating to our business.
 They'll also be managing our charitable budget for local nonprofits.
 Next slide, please.
 So to sum it up, I am confident that Theory is the most qualified applicant to operate in Medford for a couple of reasons.
 First, we have the experience necessary to ensure our dispensary in Medford will be world-class.
 We have an industry-leading track record of success and safety at our other operations in Great Barrington, Chicopee, and Bridgewater.
 We have served over 1 million guests without incident, while maintaining a 99 percentile customer rating.
 We have become a model company to our regulators, our host communities, and our customers.
 We have demonstrated that we know exactly how to operate a world-class cannabis dispensary.
 Second, we have an ambitious, progressive, and well-thought-out plan for positive community impacts here in Medford.
 We have created an incredible partnership with the arts community to construct and donate a brand new 10,000 square feet center for the arts, a first-of-its-kind program for the city.
 Moreover, we will be providing over 60 well-paying jobs with full benefits in 401k, supporting local businesses and non-profits, financing local entrepreneurs and social equity applicants, and contributing to the sustainability and diversity goals of the City.
 From a pure economic perspective, we will contribute over $2 million per year to the city in direct payments, amounts we have shown to provide to our other communities.
 Third, after years of scouting, we have carefully chosen a location that we believe makes an ideal site for a dispensary from an infrastructure, traffic, and security standpoint.
 Moreover, our location reflects the desires and priorities of the local community.
 Our location at 162 Mystic Avenue is discreet, has tremendous parking, is located in a C2 district away from residential, and will be completely revitalized through our site beautification plan.
 Having been on the forefront of the industry for years, I appreciate the challenges and unknowns that this new type of business can present.
 With our comprehensive plan for positive impact, industry-leading reputation, and operating experience, I know theory would be the premier choice for the City of Medford.
 I want to thank you all for your attention so far, and now I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan for the question and answer portion of the meeting.
 Thank you, and next slide.

 វាបានជួយខ្ញុំ ហើយប្រហែលជាវានឹងជួយអ្នកផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាសិល្បៈនឹងជួយយើងស៊ូទ្រាំនឹងការបាត់បង់នៅពេលដែលមហាសមុទ្រមិនអាចផ្ទុកការឈឺចាប់របស់យើង។
 ការផ្តល់ជូនល្អណាស់។
 មន្ទីរសុខាភិបាលទីក្រុងត្រូវបានកោតសរសើរចំពោះការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងរួមគ្នាជាមួយសហគមន៍សិល្បៈក្នុងការផ្តល់កន្លែងដែលត្រូវការច្រើន។
 ពួកគេទទួលស្គាល់តម្រូវការដើម្បីការពារបុព្វហេតុរបស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាកិច្ចសហប្រតិបត្តិការនេះនឹងក្លាយជាការពិត។

 ដូច្នេះ​សូម​អរគុណ Cindy ។
 ខ្ញុំក៏នឹងផ្តល់ឱកាសឱ្យ Brandon ឆ្លើយសំណួរនេះផងដែរ។</p>

 សម្រាប់ព្រឹត្តិការណ៍ធំៗ ប្រសិនបើវាអាចប៉ះពាល់ដល់ប្រតិបត្តិការរបស់យើងផ្ទាល់ យើងពិតជាអាចប្រើការចតនៅនឹងកន្លែងដើម្បីដោះស្រាយរឿងនោះ ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេថាយើងអាចប្រើអានុភាពប្រសិនបើចាំបាច់ ដូចជាការឱ្យបុគ្គលិករបស់យើងចតនៅតាមផ្លូវមួយថ្ងៃ ឬយូរជាងនេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាមួយនឹងកន្លែងចតរថយន្តចំនួន 59 នៅនឹងកន្លែង ខ្ញុំមានទំនុកចិត្តយ៉ាងខ្លាំងថាយើងនឹងមិនមានបញ្ហាចំណតទេ ហើយនឹងត្រូវបានរៀបចំយ៉ាងពេញលេញដើម្បីធានាថាអ្នកគ្រប់គ្នាអាចស្វែងរកកន្លែងទំនេរបានយ៉ាងឆាប់រហ័ស និងងាយស្រួល។</p>

 រស់នៅ Medford អស់រយៈពេល 21 ឆ្នាំ។
 ក្នុងអំឡុងពេលនេះ ខ្ញុំបានចូលរួមជាពិសេសជាមួយអង្គការសិល្បៈ និងបរិស្ថាន។
 ខ្ញុំរំភើបនឹងការរំពឹងទុកនៃមជ្ឈមណ្ឌលសិល្បៈដែលជាចំណុចកំពូលនៃការងារដែលមិនចេះនឿយហត់ជិត 15 ឆ្នាំរបស់អ្នកនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍សិល្បៈ។
 Medford Arts សហការ
 ខ្ញុំ​រស់​នៅ​ទី​នោះ​ពីរ​បី​ឆ្នាំ ហើយ​មើល​កន្លែង​មួយ​ចំនួន។
 នេះគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំក៏រីករាយដែលសណ្ឋាគារសង្កត់ធ្ងន់លើនិរន្តរភាព។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមានសំណួរពីរ។
 ទីមួយ
 ប្រហែលជាចម្លើយខ្លីបំផុត។
 ទាក់​ទង​នឹង​ការ​សាង​សង់​អចលន​ទ្រព្យ​នេះ ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ឃើញ​មាន​ដើម​ឈើ​ណា​មួយ​ក្នុង​រូបភាព​ខ្លី​ដែល​បាន​ផ្តល់​ជូន​នោះ​ទេ។
 ជាទូទៅមានការខ្វះខាតយ៉ាងធ្ងន់ធ្ងរនៃរុក្ខជាតិបៃតងនៅលើ Mystic Avenue ហើយខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើអ្នកមានផែនការទេសភាពដើម្បីមើលថាតើមានសក្តានុពលឬប្រសិនបើអ្នកមានគម្រោងបន្ថែមពណ៌បៃតងទៅកន្លែងនោះ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3066.07s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: បាទ អរគុណ Ken ។
 នេះគឺជា Brandon ។
 ខ្ញុំអាចឆ្លើយសំណួរនេះបាន
 ជាដំបូងសូមអរគុណចំពោះការគាំទ្រ និងគោរពសិល្បៈ។
 Nick និង I ដែលជាស្ថាបនិកទ្រឹស្តី យកចិត្តទុកដាក់យ៉ាងខ្លាំងអំពីនិរន្តរភាព និងពេញចិត្តចំពោះមតិយោបល់អំពីគម្របដើមឈើ។
 គម្រោងទេសភាពរបស់យើងមិនទាន់ត្រូវបានបញ្ចប់នៅឡើយទេ ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំពិតជាអាចពិចារណាបាន
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងប្រាកដជាចង់បានច្រើនជាងនេះ។
 បន្ថែមវាទៅទេសភាព។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ មានការជំទាស់មួយចំនួន។
 តាមទស្សនៈសុវត្ថិភាព យើងមិនចង់បិទកាមេរ៉ារបស់យើង ឬអ្វីៗដូចនោះទេ ប៉ុន្តែតំបន់មួយចំនួននៃគេហទំព័រពិតជាអាចប្រើគម្របដើមឈើមួយចំនួនដើម្បីបន្ថែមម្លប់។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ជា​ចំណុច​ល្អ។
 ដំណឹង​ល្អ​គឺ​ថា​យើង​មិន​ទាន់​បាន​បញ្ចប់​គម្រោង​សួន​របស់​យើង​នៅ​ឡើយ​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​យើង​ប្រាកដ​ជា​អាច​យក​វា​ទៅ​ក្នុង​គណនី។</p>

 សំណួរទីពីររបស់ខ្ញុំគឺ ខ្ញុំបានពិភាក្សាជាមួយមនុស្សនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍សង្គ្រោះ ហើយពួកគេចាប់អារម្មណ៍យ៉ាងខ្លាំងក្នុងការអាចគាំទ្រមជ្ឈមណ្ឌលសិល្បៈបានយ៉ាងងាយស្រួល និងចូលរួមក្នុងព្រឹត្តិការណ៍នៅទីនោះ ហើយប្រហែលជាមានស្ទូឌីយោនៅទីនោះ។
 កង្វល់​របស់​ពួកគេ​ទាក់ទង​នឹង​ការ​ជឿជាក់​ថា​ពួកគេ​អាច​រស់នៅ​បាន​ស្រួល
 ចូលមើលទីតាំងនៅជិតឱសថស្ថាន នៅពីក្រោយវា។
 អ្នកបាននិយាយអ្វីមួយអំពីកន្លែងដាច់ដោយឡែកទាំងស្រុង ដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាមានសារៈសំខាន់ ក៏ដូចជាគោលការណ៍មិនប្រើប្រាស់យ៉ាងតឹងរឹងនៅលើគេហទំព័រ។
 ខ្ញុំឆ្ងល់ថាតើអ្នកអាចនិយាយបន្ថែមទៀតអំពីការរៀបចំកន្លែងបិទជិត និងថាតើមានកន្លែងរួមដែរឬទេ?
 តើមានច្រកចូលឯកជនទេ?
 តើមានព័ត៌មានលម្អិតផ្សេងទៀតដែលអាចជួយយើងឱ្យយល់ពីរបៀបដែលអង្គភាពទាំងពីរនេះធ្វើការដោយឡែកពីគ្នាដែរឬទេ?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3183.104s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: មិនអីទេ អរគុណ Ken ។
 នេះជាសំណួរល្អណាស់។
 ចំណុចមួយចំនួនដែលត្រូវឆ្លើយ។
 ជាដំបូង ពួកវាមានចន្លោះខុសគ្នាទាំងស្រុង វាពិតជាអាចមានកន្លែងផ្ទុកទទេរវាងពួកវា អ្នកដឹងទេ ប៉ុន្តែពិតជាគ្មានវិធីដើម្បីចូលប្រើកន្លែងណាមួយផ្សេងទៀតនោះទេ។
 ច្រកចូលក៏ឯករាជ្យទាំងស្រុងផងដែរ។
 បន្ថែមពីលើនេះ បច្ចុប្បន្ននេះ យើងដំណើរការកន្លែងលក់ថ្នាំ ហើយយូរៗទៅយើងពិតជាបានរៀនពីរបៀបធានា
 អាជីវកម្មនេះដំណើរការដោយមិនដឹងខ្លួន ដូចជាហាងលក់រាយ ដូច្នេះមនុស្សជាមធ្យមប្រហែលជាមិនដឹងថាយើងធ្វើអ្វីទេ លុះត្រាតែពួកគេមករកយើងដើម្បីទិញកញ្ឆា។
 ជាឧទាហរណ៍ ហាងនឹងមិនបញ្ចេញក្លិនមិនល្អទេ ព្រោះផលិតផលទាំងអស់ត្រូវបានផ្សាភ្ជាប់ និងវេចខ្ចប់ជាមុន មុនពេលមកដល់ទីតាំង។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងមិនមានដបគំរូធំ កញ្ឆា និងរបស់របរដូចនោះទេ។
 ក្នុង​ន័យ​នេះ​វា​គឺ​ជា​វិជ្ជាជីវៈ​ខ្លាំង​ណាស់​និង​មិន​ចេះ​ពិចារណា​។
 នេះក៏អនុវត្តចំពោះផែនការគេហទំព័ររបស់យើងផងដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះ​រូបរាង​អគារ​របស់​យើង​ពិត​ជា​ធ្វើ​ឲ្យ​កន្លែង​នោះ​មាន​សោភ័ណភាព ប៉ុន្តែ​យើង​មិន​ធ្វើ​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ធ្វើ​ក្នុង​របៀប​ដែល​ភ្លឺ​ភ្នែក​នោះ​ទេ។
 គ្មានស្លឹកកញ្ឆា។
 មិនមានពន្លឺអ៊ីយូតាភ្លឺទេ។
 គាត់​មាន​ជំនាញ​វិជ្ជាជីវៈ​ខ្លាំង​ណាស់​ហើយ​ចេះ​ពិចារណា។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ទាំងស្រុងពីកង្វល់ទាំងនេះ ហើយពួកគេពិតជាត្រូវបានបង្កើតឡើងយ៉ាងល្អ។
 អ្វីដែលល្អបំផុតគឺនៅពេលដែលយើងសហការគ្នាក្នុងសិល្បៈ
 ប្រសិនបើមានបញ្ហាកើតឡើង យើងពិភាក្សាយ៉ាងឆាប់រហ័សអំពីរបៀបដោះស្រាយ និងកែលម្អបញ្ហា ឬចំណុចនៃជម្លោះ ដើម្បីធានាថាអ្នកគ្រប់គ្នាទទួលបានអត្ថប្រយោជន៍ច្រើនបំផុតពីភាពជាដៃគូ។</p>

 ដូច្នេះមានតែការចែកចាយចូលប៉ុណ្ណោះដែលនឹងត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើង។
 ដោយមិនប្រុងប្រយ័ត្ន មិនមែនក្នុងម៉ោងធ្វើការ នៅពេលណាមួយនៃថ្ងៃនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ការ​ផ្លាស់ទី​រថយន្ត​តែ​ពីរ​បី​គ្រឿង​ក្នុង​មួយ​សប្តាហ៍​នឹង​មិន​មាន​ផល​ប៉ះពាល់​ខ្លាំង​ដល់​ចរាចរណ៍​ទេ។</p>

 ខ្ញុំបានព្យាយាមទាញយកកម្មវិធី ប៉ុន្តែវាមានប្រហែល 108MB។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលវាធុញទ្រាន់ណាស់។
 នេះច្រើនពេកសម្រាប់កុំព្យូទ័រតូចរបស់ខ្ញុំមិនអាចដោះស្រាយបាន។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3600.131s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: អត់ទេ វាចាស់ណាស់
 ប៉ុន្តែយើងបានគិតច្រើនអំពីសំណើរបស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ពិត​ជា​វិធី​មួយ​ដើម្បី​មើល​ប្រវែង​នៃ​សំណើ​នេះ។</p>

 យើងយល់ថាអ្វីដែលបានពិភាក្សាកន្លងមកគឺថា អនុសាសន៍នឹងត្រូវបានបញ្ចប់នៅចុងខែសីហា ហើយថាអភិបាលក្រុងអាចឈានដល់កិច្ចព្រមព្រៀងភ្លាមៗជាមួយសហគមន៍ម្ចាស់ផ្ទះ។
 ប្រសិនបើយើងមានសំណាងគ្រប់គ្រាន់ក្នុងការជ្រើសរើស យើងអាចដាក់ពាក្យសុំអាជ្ញាប័ណ្ណរដ្ឋ ទទួលបានលិខិតអនុញ្ញាតពិសេសពី ZBA ហើយត្រៀមខ្លួនដើម្បីចាប់ផ្តើមសាងសង់នៅគ្លីនិក និងមជ្ឈមណ្ឌលសិល្បៈ។</p>
