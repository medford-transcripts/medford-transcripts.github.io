1
00:00:07,863 --> 00:00:09,064
Okay, good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:19,893
Seeing that it is five o'clock, I'd like to welcome everybody to the community outreach meeting hosted by Siri Wellness for the redevelopment and use of 162 Mystic Avenue.

3
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:21,414
My name is John Capano.

4
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,916
I'll be moderating tonight's event.

5
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:25,778
The meeting will begin momentarily.

6
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:28,981
However, we're just going to wait a few minutes to allow everyone to join the meeting.

7
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:34,005
All attendees will remain on mute until the Q&A section at the end of the presentation.

8
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:38,146
So we'll reconvene and kind of get the meeting going in a few moments here.

9
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:44,449
But I just wanted to let everyone know that tonight is being recorded and we're going to get started in just a few moments.

10
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:45,270
So thank you.

11
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,330
We appreciate your patience.

12
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:27,696
Okay, I'm going to give it another minute here.

13
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:41,119
So to kick off the community outreach mean again, but I just like to welcome everyone again on the behalf of stereo wellness for the redevelopment use of 162 mystic Avenue, we're going to begin the event at about 504.

14
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,541
I'm going to give everyone just about one more minute to join.

15
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:49,441
I just want to let everyone know that tonight's meeting is being recorded.

16
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:51,642
Just so everyone is aware of that.

17
00:03:51,782 --> 00:03:52,022
Thank you.

18
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:23,329
Okay, seeing as 505, I think we can get started here.

19
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:31,750
So again, good evening and welcome to the community outreach meeting, hosted by CERI Wellness for the Redevelopment and Use of 162 Mystic Avenue.

20
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,391
My name is John Capano.

21
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:38,872
I'm an attorney with Smith, Costello and Crawford, and I will be moderating tonight's event.

22
00:05:39,712 --> 00:05:44,573
Pursuant to the local planning ordinance and state requirements, including Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 94G,

23
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:50,995
and the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission, and we'll refer to them tonight as the CCC throughout the presentation.

24
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:51,675
I'm sure of that.

25
00:05:52,856 --> 00:05:55,017
Tonight's meeting is being recorded.

26
00:05:56,257 --> 00:06:04,721
Video recording of this meeting will be available at www.seriewellness.org backslash MA backslash Medford.

27
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:11,564
At this time, we have 13 attendees in tonight's meeting.

28
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:14,025
Next slide, please.

29
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,708
The agenda for our meeting tonight is as follows.

30
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:24,369
First, I'll provide introductions as well as meeting guidelines and information.

31
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:29,191
Then I'll provide an overview of the process for starting a marijuana dispensary in Medford.

32
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:34,153
Next, Area Wellness will provide you with a presentation of their organization and their project.

33
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:39,015
And then we'll have a question and answer period to address any questions you might have here tonight.

34
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:40,875
Next slide, please.

35
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:45,437
In regard to how this meeting will work,

36
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:51,859
If you'd like to ask a question, please use the raise hand icon at the bottom of your screen to let us know during the question and answer period.

37
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:54,420
Those of you on the phone can press star 9.

38
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:59,043
Notification is sent to me, and I'll let you know when there's an opportunity for you to speak.

39
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:04,367
You can also use the Q&A feature on Zoom to enter your question at any time.

40
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:08,189
These questions will be answered during the question and answer period.

41
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,572
Until the question and answer period, all participants will be on mute.

42
00:07:13,453 --> 00:07:14,033
Next slide, please.

43
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:24,252
A few details regarding this meeting are that the notice for this public meeting was published in the Medford Transcript newspaper on July 8, 2021.

44
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:31,995
All abutters within 300 feet of Mystic Avenue have also been sent a meeting notice via certified mail.

45
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,236
The city of Medford also advertised this meeting on their city's website.

46
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:47,180
A few quick little notes I'd like to add as well is that the meeting includes closed caption features for anyone that needs it as a part of the state

47
00:07:48,189 --> 00:07:52,731
licensing process, we have to abide by the ADA accessibility guidelines.

48
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:56,573
So they are closed caption available to any of those who need it.

49
00:07:56,973 --> 00:08:00,134
I believe the feature is found on the bottom of your screen in your zoom menu.

50
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:12,320
The applicant also posted all meeting materials prior to the tonight's meeting at least 24 hours in advance on their website, as you at the website seen on the slide here.

51
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,301
And lastly,

52
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:26,304
My role in tonight's meeting is a meeting moderator, because the CCC asks that no one involved with the license or has a direct vested interest in the license be the moderator of the meeting.

53
00:08:26,745 --> 00:08:28,165
That's where our firm comes in.

54
00:08:29,085 --> 00:08:40,168
We represent 3A Wellness here in Massachusetts, and the CCC has designated us as a neutral party to the meeting, because we have no direct or indirect control of the license.

55
00:08:40,828 --> 00:08:41,408
Next slide, please.

56
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:49,345
Okay, great.

57
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:56,510
Before we move into the presentation, we wanted to provide you with a little bit of background on why we're meeting here this evening.

58
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:04,035
In 2016, 57.4% of Medford voters endorsed the ballot question to legalize recreational marijuana.

59
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:15,642
This question also passed at the state level and due to the support of residents of Medford, the city has been working through the rules and regulations surrounding how to implement legal cannabis safely and effectively in Medford.

60
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:22,733
Last year, the City Council passed a comprehensive ordinance to permit up to three recreational marijuana dispensaries in Medford.

61
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:30,615
These are permitted to be located in the C2 zone with various proposing their dispensary as well as the industrial zone.

62
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:42,818
As part of Medford's process, the City established a Cannabis Advisory Committee to recommend to the Mayor's Office which organizations and locations are in the City's best interest to operate a retail marijuana dispensary in the City.

63
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:46,799
Those recommendations will be sent to the Mayor's Office by the end of the summer.

64
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:53,594
We will now begin the presentation by Thierry Wilmes.

65
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:57,236
I'll turn over the presentation to Brandon Pollock, the CEO of Thierry.

66
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:58,697
Brandon, thank you.

67
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:06,081
Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome everyone to our community outreach meeting.

68
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:16,548
It is a privilege to be able to discuss our plans with you all this evening, and I very much look forward to the chance to answer your questions and respond to your comments later on in the meeting.

69
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:23,833
As a bit of background, I am one of the founders of Theory Wellness, a local cannabis organization that is headquartered in Stoneham.

70
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:32,899
We were founded in 2015 and our mission is to create the highest quality dispensary experience for our local communities, our customers, and our employees.

71
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:49,879
We have a long and successful track record of operating compliant, safe, and community-centric dispensaries in the Commonwealth, and now employ approximately 300 talented team members here in Massachusetts, providing living wages and a comprehensive benefit package, including a 401k plan.

72
00:10:51,665 --> 00:11:04,197
We are well known as one of the most respected cannabis organizations in the state, routinely meeting with a variety of cannabis industry stakeholders and regulators to help improve how legal cannabis works here in Massachusetts.

73
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:12,665
We take our responsibility to operate as industry leaders very seriously and would be honored to bring our world-class operations to Medford.

74
00:11:14,065 --> 00:11:19,651
Our first dispensary is a medical only facility that we opened in Bridgewater in 2017.

75
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:30,102
We have since then grown to operate two other dispensaries in Massachusetts, one in Chicopee and one in Great Barrington, both of which serve medical patients and adult use customers.

76
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:36,907
The Great Barrington location was one of the first recreational stores to open in the state, and that was in January of 2019.

77
00:11:37,788 --> 00:11:44,353
So this has given us over two years of experience, which is very helpful here in Medford, on how to operate these businesses successfully.

78
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:52,341
Thierry also operates indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities and manufactures a wide variety of products.

79
00:11:53,041 --> 00:12:00,888
In sum, we operate 10 different cannabis licenses here in Massachusetts, which is equal or more to any operational experience of any other business in the state.

80
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:10,296
Having at this point served over 1 million different customers in Massachusetts, we look forward to bringing our extensive experience and track record to our South Medford neighborhood.

81
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:11,878
Next slide, please.

82
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:19,073
After that as well, please.

83
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:26,329
So community is very important for us at Theory.

84
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:31,673
And that's one of the unique aspects on how we run our business is our approach to community relations.

85
00:12:32,173 --> 00:12:39,259
We believe the relationship begins by being good listeners, understanding the concerns and desires from all the stakeholders in the community.

86
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:52,009
From day one, Theory has listened to and worked closely with our communities to develop positive working relationships that extend from government officials to local businesses, to grassroots organizations, and most importantly, local residents.

87
00:12:53,294 --> 00:13:04,198
Theory was one of the first cannabis companies in the state to develop a host community agreement, working with the town of Bridgewater since 2016 to share a portion of our revenue with the town to support their municipal programming.

88
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:11,340
Since then, Theory has contributed over $8 million in direct financial contributions to our host communities.

89
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:23,304
Beyond hiring locally and providing significant economic stimulus, we have focused on building long-term collaborative relationships with municipal governments, as well as local community organizations.

90
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:33,652
We have launched an educational series on cannabis, sponsored numerous charitable events, hosted food and clothing drives, and supported over 20 nonprofits in our local communities.

91
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,435
We look forward to continue on this path with our new project here in Medford.

92
00:13:38,576 --> 00:13:39,157
Next slide, please.

93
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,941
So this slide is an overview of our site plan.

94
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:48,584
We're proposing a marijuana retailer to be located at 162 Mystic Avenue.

95
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:53,206
The site is currently vacant and was previously used as a car dealership.

96
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:58,089
Our proposal is to completely renovate and beautify not just the building, but the entire site.

97
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:08,775
We searched for over a year to find the perfect location for a dispensary and are extremely happy to be proposing a location at 162 Mystic Ave for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed throughout the presentation.

98
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,933
These reasons include first and foremost parking.

99
00:14:13,514 --> 00:14:23,743
This site includes 59 parking stalls with the site plan that you're looking at right now, which is critical to ensure that no traffic issues arise and that we have no nuisance to our neighborhood.

100
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:27,407
Number two, the details of the site are pretty unique.

101
00:14:28,508 --> 00:14:43,033
As shown in the site plan, we have selected a building that has enough space to not just house a dispensary, but also donate 10,000 square feet of space to the arts community, which we will look forward to providing more information on in the upcoming slides.

102
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:54,497
Another key benefit of this proposal is that we are able to develop the dispensary in the rear of the building, ensuring that the dispensary is discreetly featured on Mystic Avenue and not front and center.

103
00:14:55,917 --> 00:15:08,324
Earlier this year, we commissioned a poll of over 250 Medford residents, and it was clear that the majority of residents preferred a dispensary to be discreetly cited like this proposal and not prominently on a main road.

104
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:10,325
Next slide, please.

105
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:27,479
In respect to zoning compliance, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, Medford has a zoning ordinance that designates the C2 and industrial zones as the two areas in the city where an adult-use dispensary can operate.

106
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:37,382
This use is subject to obtaining a special permit from the Zoning Board of Affairs, and there are not regulations from the local health board pertaining to dispensaries.

107
00:15:38,142 --> 00:15:45,604
That being said, theory has proposed a comprehensive plan to monitor local health impacts and looks forward to working with the Medford Health Department to safely operate our business.

108
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:53,385
Our site at 162 Mystic Ave is in the C2 district and is in full compliance with the city's zoning ordinance.

109
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:59,747
Importantly, we are over 500 feet away from any K through 12 schools, as shown as a diagram here.

110
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:08,324
We have already fully designed our site and construction plans and look forward to working with local builders and contractors when we are ready to construct our facility.

111
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:13,205
Renderings of our exterior and interior are provided on the following slides.

112
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:15,405
Next slide, please.

113
00:16:15,865 --> 00:16:16,165
Perfect.

114
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:19,846
So this is the proposed exterior of the dispensary.

115
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:25,668
As you can see, we, you know, are renovating the entire site and really beautifying the exterior of the building.

116
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:27,048
Next slide.

117
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:35,733
The proposed interior rendering is where we create a welcoming, bright, and safe environment for our guests.

118
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:38,135
Next slide.

119
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:48,737
So now we're going to talk about a very interesting partnership we have here with the arts community in Medford.

120
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:59,800
A core value of ours, and one of the primary reasons of our success to date, is our steadfast commitment to contributing in meaningful ways to the communities that we operate in.

121
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:07,282
In Medford, we are extremely excited and fortunate to be proposing a variety of ways in which we will expect to benefit the community.

122
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:12,864
First and foremost, we have established a tremendous partnership with the arts community in Medford.

123
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:24,490
For the last six months, we have had discussions with local leaders in the arts community and learned that despite good efforts and intentions, the arts community in Medford has never been able to find a home.

124
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,951
That will all change with Theory Medford.

125
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:36,215
We have committed to donating 10,000 square feet of our building to the Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that will help manage this brand new arts center.

126
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:47,279
In addition to providing the space free of charge, Theory will completely renovate the space to the specifications necessary to provide this community benefit.

127
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:53,322
This will create studio space, meeting space, office space, and performing space for the arts.

128
00:17:54,322 --> 00:18:06,908
Our architect has already been working on preliminary floor plans as mentioned on this slide and we couldn't be happier with the partnership and if all goes to plan we would have the community art center up and running in early 2022.

129
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:07,188
Next slide.

130
00:18:13,686 --> 00:18:26,240
Theory understands that diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity are necessary foundational pillars in building a strong team that represents the communities we operate in and facilitates the creation of a value-driven organization.

131
00:18:27,335 --> 00:18:33,078
Theory also recognizes how the war on drugs disproportionately affected certain communities of color.

132
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:47,386
As leaders in the cannabis industry, we have a real responsibility to lead by example, create positive change, and foster opportunities for generational wealth creation for those who have been negatively affected by the unjust historical policies.

133
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:58,535
To that end, in 2019 theory launched a first of its kind social equity program, providing $250,000 in no strings attached zero interest financing.

134
00:18:58,996 --> 00:19:06,621
In addition to resources training and coaching to an economic empowerment applicant who is in the process of launching their own dispensary.

135
00:19:07,401 --> 00:19:19,784
After interviewing around a dozen qualified applicants, in July of 2019, Theory selected entrepreneurs Vanessa Jean Baptiste and Mark Bouquet of Legal Greens to be the first participants in our program.

136
00:19:20,444 --> 00:19:29,066
Legal Greens is comprised of these two business partners, both Black, one being a woman, who grew up and reside in neighborhoods that were adversely affected by the war on drugs.

137
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:37,008
After nearly two years, in March 2021, Legal Greens opened their recreational dispensary in Brockton, becoming the first Black-owned

138
00:19:37,768 --> 00:19:40,251
woman-owned recreational dispensary on the East Coast.

139
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:49,138
We're very proud of the team at Legal Greens and look forward to replicating this program in Medford if we're fortunate enough to continue on with our project here.

140
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,764
Additionally, Theory is committed to hiring a diverse workforce in Medford.

141
00:19:56,144 --> 00:20:02,329
We truly believe that our people is what allows our company to be most successful and that diversity is an asset to any organization.

142
00:20:03,306 --> 00:20:10,168
proven to foster improved decision-making, increased innovation, stronger customer relationships, and increased employee engagement.

143
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:18,050
In Medford, Theory has worked closely with the Mystic branch of the NAACP on a comprehensive diversity hiring plan.

144
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:27,733
We are committed to creating a workforce that is at least 50% women, 35% diverse, and 5% veteran, with this goal extending through all management positions.

145
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:35,502
Theory offers terrific advancement opportunities and goes through great lengths in our recruitment process to ensure we are hiring without bias or discrimination.

146
00:20:36,703 --> 00:20:37,264
Next slide, please.

147
00:20:40,947 --> 00:20:44,188
A major driver of our positive impact in Medford will be economic.

148
00:20:44,788 --> 00:20:50,869
First, we plan on hiring over 60 well-paid full-time individuals with a mandate that the workforce is diverse and local.

149
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:54,910
Specifically, at least 75% of our employees will be Medford residents.

150
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,911
All team members are provided comprehensive benefits, which include a 401k plan.

151
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:10,293
We're especially proud to offer this 401k plan, which right now is not very common in the cannabis industry due to the challenges in working with finding a provider for a program like that.

152
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:25,103
As the number one retailer in Massachusetts, we are confident in our projections that each year our Medford dispensary will provide the city with over $2 million in direct cash contributions through both tax revenue and our community host agreement.

153
00:21:25,883 --> 00:21:34,329
In addition to the commitments to donate to the arts community, Theory has also allocated $50,000 per year to support local nonprofits.

154
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:40,013
This is consistent with our track record as we have already support dozens of nonprofits throughout the state.

155
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:42,270
Next slide, please.

156
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:54,299
We acknowledge and appreciate that one of the possible negative impacts from an adult use dispensary is localized traffic condition.

157
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:07,649
In order to meet the economic development goals of the city while simultaneously avoiding any traffic congestion problems, an operator must carefully choose a location that is suitable to handle a high volume of customers.

158
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:19,689
There are very few properties within the permitted zones in Medford that provide easy access, have sufficient parking, contain good interior space, and would not materially impact localized traffic.

159
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:29,119
This is something that we took very seriously and we're well qualified to analyze having years of experience citing and operating high traffic retail dispensers.

160
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:46,928
After looking at dozens of options in Medford for our proposed site, we committed to 162 Mystic Avenue based on a number of factors, including and importantly, the site's ability to serve our projected number of customer visits per day from an access parking and favorable traffic impact perspective.

161
00:22:48,569 --> 00:23:02,312
Our location is a former car dealership located two minutes off 93 with 59 parking stalls, significantly more than what our projected daily customer visits would demand as further detailed below.

162
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:18,316
By comparison, in Great Barrington and Chicopee, where we also operate recreational dispensaries, our location served between 600 and over 1,000 customers per day on busy days with less parking capacity and have had zero material traffic issues to date.

163
00:23:19,677 --> 00:23:28,983
To demonstrate the suitability of our proposed location, Theory engaged a professional traffic engineering and analysis firm to perform a comprehensive traffic study.

164
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:39,650
This 27-page traffic study concluded that our operation of a marijuana retailer at 162 Mystic Avenue would not negatively impact traffic on Mystic Ave.

165
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:56,062
Furthermore, as we have done at our other locations, we will work closely with the Medford Police Department to ensure we have a comprehensive traffic control plan in place, including police details as necessary for the initial opening period.

166
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:58,165
Next slide, please.

167
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:15,162
Our track record and experience showcase that our operational plans and staff training will lead to the safe operations of a marijuana retailer in Medford, including ensuring that diversion and underage sales do not take place at our location.

168
00:24:16,012 --> 00:24:20,256
We have served over 1 million customers in Massachusetts without any underage sales.

169
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:27,562
We check identification three times, once at the door, once in the reception room, and again at the sales counter.

170
00:24:28,223 --> 00:24:34,388
Furthermore, we use a machine called ID Science that scans each identification for validity.

171
00:24:34,928 --> 00:24:39,793
This equipment is also used in casinos and updates itself every 30 days with a

172
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:46,499
comprehensive database of all valid forms of state ID across the country, as well as all passports in the world.

173
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:53,225
By using this machine, we have caught hundreds of expired or invalid forms of identification at our other locations.

174
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:58,273
All of our products are secured in the vault, which has extensive security features.

175
00:24:58,814 --> 00:25:04,677
We are also constantly monitoring our parking areas and have a zero tolerance policy for consumption of cannabis on site.

176
00:25:05,177 --> 00:25:11,041
Any customers that are found to be consuming on site would be permanently banned from returning to our location.

177
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:12,762
Next slide, please.

178
00:25:15,944 --> 00:25:22,048
An important aspect to discuss is the safety and security that will be designed and implemented at our dispensary.

179
00:25:23,026 --> 00:25:29,313
It is first helpful to acknowledge and appreciate that Theory has served over a million customers with an excellent safety and security track record.

180
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:39,884
And in our other communities, we maintain direct lines of communication with our local law enforcement partners, whom have written letters of recommendation, calling Theory a model for others to follow.

181
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:46,914
Our comprehensive safety and security plan would first be reviewed with the Medford Police Department prior to being finalized.

182
00:25:47,335 --> 00:25:53,024
We always look forward to receiving feedback and improving our plan based on conversations with law enforcement professionals.

183
00:25:54,363 --> 00:26:02,109
At all times during operational hours, Theory has a highly trained safety and security team that works both inside and outside the dispensary.

184
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:06,472
They are there to ensure that no prohibited activities take place on our premise.

185
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:17,800
In large part due to our terrific safety and security team, we have not had any nuisance complaints about unsavory customer activity from any of our neighbors at our existing locations.

186
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:26,732
Moreover, the dispensary will be outfitted with an extensive alarm and video monitoring system using the most modern technology available.

187
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:35,216
This technology is a cornerstone of our safety and security plan and allows us to offer both a welcoming and safe environment for our guests and our neighbors.

188
00:26:36,017 --> 00:26:36,637
Next slide, please.

189
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:49,779
Theory is committed to leading the cannabis industry by taking meaningful measures towards achieving a more sustainable future, despite the level of short-term investment it may require.

190
00:26:50,479 --> 00:26:56,003
Sustainability is a fundamental value at Theory, woven into our decision-making on a daily basis.

191
00:26:56,803 --> 00:27:15,207
To date, we have invested millions in energy-reductive technology, effectively offsetting over 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year by moving 90% of our cannabis cultivation operations outdoors, and have greened the majority of our energy usage by purchasing over 85% of our energy from renewable sources.

192
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:20,528
Our plan for Medford will push our sustainability actions even further.

193
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:48,584
We have a 79-point sustainability action plan consisting of bold measures, including the installation of 263 solar panels on our roof, pledging to electrify our vehicles, obtaining 100% of our company-wide energy needs from renewables, purchasing carbon offsets, sourcing from and supporting local businesses, installing electric vehicle charging stations, incentivizing public transportation,

194
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:56,550
using sustainable design and building materials, and sponsoring green entrepreneurship in the city of Medford.

195
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:05,733
To hold ourselves accountable, we will establish a director of sustainability and engage with third party consultants to audit our dispensary on a periodic basis.

196
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:18,813
Theory admires and respects the City of Medford's ambitious goals relating to sustainability and energy efficiency and believes our operation will align with and contribute meaningfully towards a shared mission.

197
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:23,495
We look forward to being a corporate steward and a contributing member of the Medford community.

198
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:24,695
Next slide, please.

199
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:39,494
Over the years, Thierry has spent extensive time in the Medford community to understand the concerns and desires of Medford residents and businesses relating to the siting and operation of a marijuana retailer.

200
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:54,903
Thierry undertook an independent survey of over 250 Medford residents and incorporated their feedback into our proposal, ensuring that our location, our charitable initiatives, and our hiring plans serve the community best.

201
00:28:56,343 --> 00:29:09,974
Additionally, we have forged a remarkable relationship with local arts community to design, construct, and provide free ongoing use of a 10,000 square foot community center for the arts, a landmark partnership of historic value.

202
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:25,487
Thierry has spoken extensively with hundreds of abutters, local businesses, local leaders, and residents, and received tremendous support, evidenced by the over 60 local letters of support that we've received from a variety of locations as shown in the map on this slide.

203
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:41,059
To ensure our local relationship only continues to strengthen, Thierry will be hiring a full-time director of community relations whose primary responsibility is fostering and strengthening the quality of our relationship with the community.

204
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:49,684
This individual will be based in Medford and will serve as the day-to-day face of Thierry and a conduit for our community relations.

205
00:29:51,167 --> 00:29:55,950
This is beyond attending and participating in meetings and community events relating to our business.

206
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,751
They'll also be managing our charitable budget for local nonprofits.

207
00:30:01,212 --> 00:30:01,913
Next slide, please.

208
00:30:04,954 --> 00:30:11,758
So to sum it up, I am confident that Theory is the most qualified applicant to operate in Medford for a couple of reasons.

209
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,141
First, we have the experience necessary to ensure our dispensary in Medford will be world-class.

210
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:24,963
We have an industry-leading track record of success and safety at our other operations in Great Barrington, Chicopee, and Bridgewater.

211
00:30:26,063 --> 00:30:33,144
We have served over 1 million guests without incident, while maintaining a 99 percentile customer rating.

212
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:42,617
We have become a model company to our regulators, our host communities, and our customers.

213
00:30:42,938 --> 00:30:46,719
We have demonstrated that we know exactly how to operate a world-class cannabis dispensary.

214
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:54,443
Second, we have an ambitious, progressive, and well-thought-out plan for positive community impacts here in Medford.

215
00:30:55,023 --> 00:31:03,887
We have created an incredible partnership with the arts community to construct and donate a brand new 10,000 square feet center for the arts, a first-of-its-kind program for the city.

216
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:22,794
Moreover, we will be providing over 60 well-paying jobs with full benefits in 401k, supporting local businesses and non-profits, financing local entrepreneurs and social equity applicants, and contributing to the sustainability and diversity goals of the City.

217
00:31:24,502 --> 00:31:34,427
From a pure economic perspective, we will contribute over $2 million per year to the city in direct payments, amounts we have shown to provide to our other communities.

218
00:31:36,167 --> 00:31:45,752
Third, after years of scouting, we have carefully chosen a location that we believe makes an ideal site for a dispensary from an infrastructure, traffic, and security standpoint.

219
00:31:46,564 --> 00:31:51,847
Moreover, our location reflects the desires and priorities of the local community.

220
00:31:52,367 --> 00:32:04,373
Our location at 162 Mystic Avenue is discreet, has tremendous parking, is located in a C2 district away from residential, and will be completely revitalized through our site beautification plan.

221
00:32:05,694 --> 00:32:12,858
Having been on the forefront of the industry for years, I appreciate the challenges and unknowns that this new type of business can present.

222
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:23,797
With our comprehensive plan for positive impact, industry-leading reputation, and operating experience, I know theory would be the premier choice for the City of Medford.

223
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:31,962
I want to thank you all for your attention so far, and now I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan for the question and answer portion of the meeting.

224
00:32:32,402 --> 00:32:33,263
Thank you, and next slide.

225
00:32:36,145 --> 00:32:36,725
Thank you, Brandon.

226
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:49,011
Okay, as a reminder, pursuant to local planning ordinances and state requirements, including Massachusetts General Law Chapter 94G and the CCC regulations, this meeting is a public meeting and is being recorded.

227
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,994
I just kind of want to refresh everybody on the meeting guidelines.

228
00:32:52,454 --> 00:32:55,877
I will now open up the public comment and Q&A portion of the meeting.

229
00:32:56,658 --> 00:33:01,121
I will first be reading the questions and comments we received in advance by residents.

230
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:05,505
Then I'll recognize those questions that have already been posted in the Q&A section.

231
00:33:05,972 --> 00:33:08,293
And then finally, we'll open up for general questions and answers.

232
00:33:09,274 --> 00:33:14,476
Please use the raise hand icon at the bottom of your screen to let us know if you wish to speak.

233
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:16,957
Those of you on the phone, you can press star nine.

234
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:23,360
A notification is sent to me and I'll let you know when it is your turn to go ahead and ask your question or make your comment.

235
00:33:24,401 --> 00:33:28,543
You can also use the Q&A icon to enter a question for all the panelists to see.

236
00:33:29,103 --> 00:33:33,385
I will then read your question out loud and have our subject matter experts answer that question.

237
00:33:34,243 --> 00:33:40,086
Once you're recognized to speak, you can mute or unmute yourself with the radio microphone icon in the Zoom app.

238
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:46,209
If there is a red slash through, if there's a red slash marked through it, your line is muted.

239
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:53,133
So let me go ahead and pull up, I believe we got eight questions and comments in advance.

240
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:57,335
I'm gonna go read through those in the order in which they came in.

241
00:33:57,855 --> 00:34:01,797
I'll allow Brandon or whoever the subject matter expert is

242
00:34:02,697 --> 00:34:08,520
an opportunity to respond, and then we will move on to the next question in the next section.

243
00:34:09,501 --> 00:34:11,162
So this is from May.

244
00:34:12,022 --> 00:34:16,125
May, I apologize for mispronouncing your last name, but I think it's Mark Brick.

245
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:28,972
She wrote, dear Theory Wellness, as an advocate of the arts in the city of Medford for more than 30 years and the founder of CATCH, C-A-T-H-E in Medford,

246
00:34:29,762 --> 00:34:42,246
I know firsthand how important it is for the arts community to have a home where we can have meetings, offer programs to the general public without charge or minimum fee, and have space for artists, studios, et cetera.

247
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:51,808
Interest in the arts and culture has grown immensely in the past decade, so to have a community center would increase our ability to respond to this trend.

248
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:57,010
In the past five years, art-related programs slash events have grown from 605 events

249
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:00,474
to more than 1,000, an increase of 65%.

250
00:35:02,455 --> 00:35:07,278
Your offer for 10,000 square feet of space on Mystic Avenue would be the answer to our needs and dreams.

251
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:24,308
Every town adjacent to our city has a Center for the Arts community, so we wholeheartedly support your application to the City of Medford for establishing an adult use resale business that will include providing Art Collaborative Medford, a nonprofit organization, with a space for a community arts center.

252
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:31,921
Thank you on behalf of many art-related organizations in the community for your proposal in support of the arts.

253
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:38,587
Brandon, I'll allow you an opportunity to kind of make, there's no question there, but kind of make comment on what was submitted from May.

254
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:39,648
Sure.

255
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:40,369
Thanks, Jonathan.

256
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:49,257
I'll just say thank you, May, for the kind words, and we're very excited to work with you and the arts community on this project.

257
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:49,697
Thank you.

258
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:51,679
Great.

259
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,900
OK, the next question is from Pam Shanley.

260
00:35:55,941 --> 00:36:03,722
There's there's a handful of questions here, so I'm going to read the general statement made and then will break down each question one by one.

261
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:12,044
It says hi, thank you for doing this here and a couple of questions from Pam, a member of Catch Arts Group in Medford and a resident of Medford.

262
00:36:12,664 --> 00:36:17,465
First, what is the potential relationship with the dispensary and the Medford Arts Group?

263
00:36:20,068 --> 00:36:24,751
Brandon, if you'd just like to summarize that relationship, I know it was addressed.

264
00:36:25,371 --> 00:36:41,499
Yeah, so essentially we would be acting as a landlord where we're providing the space free of charge, as well as constructing the Arts Center to the specifications presented by the Arts Collaborative.

265
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,824
We would have no operational control or involvement other than just being a landlord where we're providing free rental to the community.

266
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,081
Great.

267
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:57,205
The next question here, would they have the freedom to rent out the space for art classes, performances, and parties?

268
00:36:58,666 --> 00:36:59,527
Yeah, absolutely.

269
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:06,692
Who would manage the Medford Art Group or will they have the freedom to do anything within set boundaries?

270
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,574
What would these potential boundaries be?

271
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:17,938
So I can't speak too much about the management of the Arts Collaborative from our perspective.

272
00:37:17,978 --> 00:37:27,200
That is, you know, it's a nonprofit organization that it seems like it's very well managed with a diverse group of people working on that.

273
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:34,822
And from my view, you know, they have the freedom to use the spaces they see as the best use for the community.

274
00:37:37,742 --> 00:37:38,643
The next question is short.

275
00:37:38,663 --> 00:37:39,923
Will there be Wi-Fi available?

276
00:37:41,113 --> 00:37:41,994
Uh, yeah, absolutely.

277
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:44,296
Um, okay.

278
00:37:44,376 --> 00:37:45,116
Last two.

279
00:37:45,437 --> 00:37:51,882
What are the hours that the arts, what are the hours that the Medford arts group would have accessibility to the building?

280
00:37:52,442 --> 00:37:53,743
Uh, would it be 24 seven?

281
00:37:55,425 --> 00:37:55,605
Yep.

282
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:55,865
Yeah.

283
00:37:55,885 --> 00:38:04,732
It's a, it's a totally separate space from the dispensary and they would have full control over the, um, the times that they want individuals, you know, accessing the space.

284
00:38:05,853 --> 00:38:06,073
Great.

285
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,255
And then the last question was on parking.

286
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:15,345
Yep, they'll be parking both ADA accessible and conventional parking stalls right in front of the Arts Center.

287
00:38:16,666 --> 00:38:19,907
Great, thank you Brandon and thank you Pam for submitting your question.

288
00:38:19,927 --> 00:38:25,569
I do see you here on the meeting as well, so I'm happy that we had a chance to answer your question.

289
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:29,790
OK, third question is from Cindy Watson.

290
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:38,013
There's a plethora of research to indicate that the arts are a lifeline, but conversely a death.

291
00:38:39,003 --> 00:38:41,104
of space to accommodate the art.

292
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:45,267
Last August, President Biden declared, the future of who we are lies in the art.

293
00:38:45,787 --> 00:38:47,228
It is the expression of our soul.

294
00:38:48,028 --> 00:38:53,912
This profound statement is a wake-up call for the need to allocate money from the federal budget to fund the arts and culture.

295
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:03,777
I'm just going to read through this, but just for the record, for the Q&A and for the

296
00:39:06,368 --> 00:39:13,550
for the opportunity to speak, which I'm gonna try to say a little bit more on topic with Theory Wellness and their involvement in the community.

297
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:18,231
However, I do appreciate the comments made here and this message we received.

298
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:29,553
So, this profound statement is a wake-up call for the need to allocate money for the federal budget to fund arts and culture.

299
00:39:29,713 --> 00:39:34,835
Currently, the United States lags greatly behind our European counterparts in the funding for arts.

300
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:38,352
exaggerated this need.

301
00:39:39,473 --> 00:39:44,897
Artists from across the world support this notion with one expressing this touching message.

302
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:58,427
What I know about the last 15 months is about outstanding the darkest, to make joy, to make good at every opportunity, to see beauty in every day in the work of the artists who believe will help us find ourselves again.

303
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,128
This helps me and maybe you too.

304
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:05,732
I believe art will help us carry our loss when the ocean cannot hold our sorrow.

305
00:40:06,877 --> 00:40:07,518
Very nice quote.

306
00:40:08,018 --> 00:40:13,701
City wellness should be complimented on their endeavors to collaborate with the arts community in providing much needed space.

307
00:40:13,901 --> 00:40:17,083
They recognize the need to champion our cause.

308
00:40:17,503 --> 00:40:19,705
It is my hope that this partnership comes to fruition.

309
00:40:20,225 --> 00:40:25,968
It will certainly put a smile on everyone's face that is truly, which is truly the universal language.

310
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:28,229
So thank you, Cindy.

311
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:31,051
I'll offer Brandon an opportunity to respond to that as well.

312
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:34,591
Yeah, echo that Jonathan.

313
00:40:34,611 --> 00:40:34,991
Thank you.

314
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:36,071
Thank you, Cindy.

315
00:40:37,472 --> 00:40:41,333
We appreciate the kind words and also very much look forward to the partnership.

316
00:40:43,914 --> 00:40:47,175
Okay, the next question is from Robert Garcia.

317
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:52,637
Balloon boss, I don't know if that's a business name or, or, so forgive me for that.

318
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:57,719
But to whom it may concern, Theory Wellness is one of the most lucrative marijuana companies in Massachusetts.

319
00:40:58,199 --> 00:41:01,940
They've been in the business for over four years in Bridgewater, Chicopee and Great Barrington.

320
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,407
It would be the best financial cannabis partner for Medford and we taxpayers.

321
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:10,108
As I understand it, they must pay to see 3% of gross profit.

322
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:13,529
No other applicant come close comes close to them.

323
00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:15,649
So we can.

324
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,370
There's no question there.

325
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,191
But again, I'll offer Brandon an opportunity to respond.

326
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:22,351
Yeah, thanks, Jonathan.

327
00:41:22,431 --> 00:41:24,692
And I think, yeah, I think it's local business owner.

328
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:40,771
And to clarify from an economic perspective, we're actually going to be sharing 6% of our revenue, not profits, so an even more significant amount of cash with the city, which should help ease the burden on other taxpayers, all else fixed.

329
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:43,633
So we certainly look forward to helping the community in that way.

330
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:46,996
Great.

331
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,719
OK, so this is from Sylvia Garcia.

332
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,741
I, Sylvia Garcia, support

333
00:41:52,367 --> 00:41:59,314
theory wellness and its application to cite a cannabis dispensary on mystic app because I saw their plans and the building looks beautiful.

334
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:09,443
I particularly like how the cannabis business is located in the rear of the building away from the street and out of everybody's view, while the front of the building will have a separate use unrelated to marijuana.

335
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:13,327
So, and this comes from

336
00:42:16,232 --> 00:42:17,973
Sylvia, who is a Medford resident.

337
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:22,895
I won't put her address out, but she signed as her resident, which we appreciate.

338
00:42:24,756 --> 00:42:26,737
So again, Brandon, I'll offer you an opportunity to respond.

339
00:42:27,392 --> 00:42:29,414
No, we appreciate the comment, Sylvia.

340
00:42:29,454 --> 00:42:31,115
Thank you for your support.

341
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:47,871
And we certainly agree that, as you mentioned, when we did a comprehensive poll of Medford residents earlier this year, we heard loud and clear that folks, they do want adult use cannabis, but they want it in a discrete location, which we have the perfect opportunity to provide here.

342
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:48,411
So thank you.

343
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:50,754
Thank you, Brandon.

344
00:42:50,774 --> 00:42:52,075
This is from

345
00:42:53,021 --> 00:42:57,943
Melissa Miguel, another Medford resident, I don't want to read out the whole address again.

346
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:05,705
She wrote in city officials, I am writing today to show support of theory wellness and a proposed location on Mystic Avenue in South Medford.

347
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:19,629
As long as a longtime South Medford resident, I am pleased to see a responsible neighbor partner interest and a responsible neighborhood partner interested in doing their business in our neighborhood.

348
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:25,335
They have a great track record in marijuana in Massachusetts and take safety and security very seriously.

349
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:33,960
They provide a 24 hour surveillance of their property while ensuring no infringement on the privacy of the private property in the surrounding area.

350
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:44,027
Medford has done a poor job in attracting businesses to South Medford area and I hope that it's changing with the approval of Dairy Wellness on Mystic Avenue.

351
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:48,070
Again, Brandon, I'll offer you an opportunity to comment.

352
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:52,341
Yeah, no, we appreciate the support, Melissa.

353
00:43:53,142 --> 00:44:08,193
We certainly believe and agree with you that our presence at 162 Mystic Ave would increase the overall safety and security of the neighborhood as well as provide new customers to other local businesses that are going to be shopping with us.

354
00:44:09,394 --> 00:44:13,036
Certainly those customers will be visiting our neighbors as well.

355
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:17,740
So we think it's a win-win for the business community in South Medford.

356
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,470
That's great.

357
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,211
Next question is from Jonathan Fagan.

358
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:24,812
He says, hello again.

359
00:44:25,192 --> 00:44:26,152
My name is Jonathan Fagan.

360
00:44:26,172 --> 00:44:30,693
I'm a board member of CATCH and the founder of Medford Jazz Festival.

361
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:45,598
I want to reiterate my support for Siri Wellness' application ahead of their meeting later today, especially because of their proposed dedication of 10,000 square feet of art space to the community, a new space supporting both the performing and visual arts for pay

362
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:53,718
an enormous role in revitalizing the whole arts community, especially considering the number of venues that have closed in recent months.

363
00:44:54,279 --> 00:45:03,166
Storefront on Mystic Avenue would provide a much needed visibility, especially for painters and other artists looking to show their work to the broader community.

364
00:45:03,646 --> 00:45:10,352
Keep me posted about the meeting, about how the meeting goes, and let me know what else I can do to help best Johnson.

365
00:45:12,832 --> 00:45:14,273
Yeah, no, thanks, Jonathan.

366
00:45:14,313 --> 00:45:24,000
We appreciate the kind words and the support and certainly would look forward to the opportunity to provide the space to the arts.

367
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:24,520
Thank you.

368
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:28,383
Great.

369
00:45:29,443 --> 00:45:35,908
OK, the last submitted question is from Jessica Rubitico.

370
00:45:36,688 --> 00:45:38,670
Sorry if I mispronounced the last name there.

371
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:41,832
I'm very pleased to support theory wellness on Mystic Ave.

372
00:45:42,255 --> 00:45:48,598
They have gone above and beyond the call by bringing the arts of Medford to their site fronting Mystic Avenue.

373
00:45:48,618 --> 00:45:52,519
The arts in Medford have never had a home and it's about time.

374
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:54,100
Thank you, Siri, we love you.

375
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,122
This is from Jessica and she is a Medford resident.

376
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,723
Yeah, thanks, Jessica.

377
00:46:00,743 --> 00:46:09,827
We very much appreciate the support and would be very pleased and fortunate if we can continue to move forward with the project and get the Arts Center up and running.

378
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:12,617
Great, thank you, Brandon.

379
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:15,438
So that concludes the questions that were submitted in advance.

380
00:46:16,078 --> 00:46:18,738
I'm going to now go over to the Q&A section.

381
00:46:19,658 --> 00:46:23,659
I just want to note for the record that we have 18 attendees in the meeting right now.

382
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:25,679
So this is from Brenda Bree.

383
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,880
Which arts organization in Medford are you partnering with?

384
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:33,261
I think we'll just clarify that again.

385
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:36,861
Yeah, the organization is called the Arts Collaborative.

386
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:39,722
It's a newly formed nonprofit that is

387
00:46:40,763 --> 00:47:01,167
My understanding is sort of a collaboration between multiple existing art groups in Medford that are coming together to work together to, you know, help us design the space for the arts community and then would be the ones that are technically subleasing the space from theory free of charge.

388
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:05,527
So the Arts Collaborative is the name of the arts organization that we're working with.

389
00:47:05,547 --> 00:47:09,348
Thank you, Brandon.

390
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:13,970
The next question... Okay, great.

391
00:47:15,771 --> 00:47:18,573
Sorry, this is a little new territory here.

392
00:47:18,953 --> 00:47:27,459
Danny Leon asks, can Brandon clarify his ownership in Temescal Wellness?

393
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:37,567
Yeah, so I'm guessing this... So I was involved with a company called Temescal Wellness as a nonprofit in the state of New Hampshire.

394
00:47:38,547 --> 00:47:39,488
many, many years ago.

395
00:47:39,828 --> 00:47:46,812
I have no ownership or involvement or control or knowledge about anything to 10 minutes wellness in Massachusetts.

396
00:47:46,852 --> 00:47:48,313
So no, no ownership there.

397
00:47:50,754 --> 00:47:51,414
Thank you, Brandon.

398
00:47:54,196 --> 00:47:59,919
Another one from Dan Leon, can you please explain the ownership of Theory Farms?

399
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:07,844
So Theory Farms, that was a project that myself and some of the other founders of Theory

400
00:48:08,642 --> 00:48:12,285
started several years ago that obtained a provisional license.

401
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:16,568
We never moved forward with the project and actually divested from that license.

402
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:26,475
So I am not aware of the current ownership of Theory Farms, though I believe they've actually, once they acquired the license, changed their name to something else.

403
00:48:26,575 --> 00:48:31,059
But we currently have no interest in Theory Farms.

404
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,060
OK.

405
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:34,521
Thank you, Brendan.

406
00:48:35,702 --> 00:48:38,344
The last Q&A section is from Brenda Breath.

407
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:41,839
How will parking be shared between the dispensary and the art space?

408
00:48:41,979 --> 00:48:43,942
Will some spaces be reserved for each?

409
00:48:45,963 --> 00:48:55,329
Yeah, so I think, um, as we finalize our, our site plan and our development plan with the arts collaborative, we can talk more about how we want to run parking.

410
00:48:55,829 --> 00:49:06,695
Um, I think generally we'll want to make sure that there is some parking reserved for, um, for the arts collaborative, um, anytime they might, might need it, you know, right in front of the space.

411
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:14,200
And then if they're having larger events, I think we'd want to just have a collaborative relationship with our dispensary management team to make sure that we're prepared to handle.

412
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:27,001
a larger event if it may impact our own operations, we certainly can handle that with how much parking we have on site and can, you know, use levers such as having our staff park across the street for a day or something like that if necessary.

413
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:40,287
But with 59 parking stalls on the site, I'm really confident we're going to have no parking concerns at all and we'll be, you know, really well set up to ensure that everyone can quickly and easily find a place to park.

414
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:41,728
Great.

415
00:49:41,768 --> 00:49:42,368
Thank you, Brandon.

416
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:50,034
Seeing no more questions in the Q&A section of the Zoom chat, I'm going to move to those with their hands raised.

417
00:49:51,014 --> 00:49:53,216
So I'm going to go to Ken Krause.

418
00:49:54,056 --> 00:50:00,580
Ken, we're going to allow you to open up your microphone and video if you so choose.

419
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,020
So Ken.

420
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:02,921
Can you hear me?

421
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:04,082
Yes.

422
00:50:04,522 --> 00:50:05,022
Okay, thank you.

423
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:05,983
Yeah, Ken Krause.

424
00:50:06,843 --> 00:50:08,605
21-year Medford resident.

425
00:50:09,286 --> 00:50:14,573
I've been involved with arts and environmental organizations in particular over that time.

426
00:50:14,593 --> 00:50:23,684
Very excited about the prospects of the Arts Center, which has been an ongoing effort by people in the arts community for probably 15 years.

427
00:50:23,724 --> 00:50:25,146
The Arts Collaborative Medford has been

428
00:50:25,872 --> 00:50:28,635
at it for several years, looking at a couple of venues.

429
00:50:29,015 --> 00:50:29,956
So that's very exciting.

430
00:50:29,976 --> 00:50:35,121
I'm also pleased with the sustainability emphasis on the property.

431
00:50:35,141 --> 00:50:36,763
So I have two questions.

432
00:50:37,403 --> 00:50:38,064
The first one,

433
00:50:38,987 --> 00:50:40,388
is probably the shorter answer.

434
00:50:40,748 --> 00:50:47,192
With regard to building out the property, I didn't see any trees in the brief image that was shown.

435
00:50:48,033 --> 00:51:04,423
Trees are greatly lacking along Mystic Avenue in general and I wonder if you have the landscaping plan to the point where you know if there is potential or if you do have plans to add trees to the property.

436
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:06,691
Yeah, thanks, Ken.

437
00:51:06,711 --> 00:51:07,371
This is Brandon.

438
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,012
I can answer that.

439
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:12,115
First, thank you for your support and respect to the art side of things.

440
00:51:13,376 --> 00:51:21,462
Myself and Nick, the founders of Theory, we really do care about sustainability and appreciate the comment regarding tree cover.

441
00:51:22,063 --> 00:51:26,386
Our landscaping plan is not finalized, so I certainly can take that into consideration.

442
00:51:26,426 --> 00:51:27,627
I think we certainly want to add

443
00:51:29,249 --> 00:51:30,350
add that to the landscape.

444
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,331
You know, there's a couple caveats.

445
00:51:32,371 --> 00:51:40,417
We don't want to be blocking our cameras or things like that from a security perspective, but there's certainly areas of the site that could use some tree cover that should add some shade.

446
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:42,839
So I think that's a great, great point.

447
00:51:43,259 --> 00:51:46,762
And the good news is we haven't finalized the landscaping plan.

448
00:51:46,782 --> 00:51:48,323
So we certainly can take that into account.

449
00:51:49,836 --> 00:51:50,596
Okay, thank you.

450
00:51:51,056 --> 00:52:10,021
My second question is, I've had conversations with people in the recovery community, and they are very interested in being able to comfortably support the Art Center and attend events there, perhaps have a studio there.

451
00:52:10,582 --> 00:52:17,584
And their concerns have been related to their confidence that they're gonna be able to comfortably

452
00:52:20,142 --> 00:52:24,904
visit a site in such close proximity to the dispensary right behind it.

453
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:39,068
And you said a few things regarding the space as being totally separate, which is important, I think, and also the strict policy about no consumption on site.

454
00:52:39,608 --> 00:52:49,439
I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about how the setup is going to be in terms of the spaces being contiguous and are there shared spaces?

455
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:52,101
Are there separate entrances?

456
00:52:52,602 --> 00:53:02,272
Any more detail that would help us understand how the two entities will be functioning but together but separate?

457
00:53:03,104 --> 00:53:04,145
Yeah, no, thanks, Ken.

458
00:53:04,165 --> 00:53:06,646
That's a very good, a good question.

459
00:53:06,686 --> 00:53:08,888
A couple of points there to respond.

460
00:53:08,988 --> 00:53:20,235
First, they are totally different spaces and there's actually going to be a small kind of empty storage area, potentially, you know, in between them, but there's absolutely no access from one space to the other.

461
00:53:21,816 --> 00:53:23,877
Totally separate entrances as well.

462
00:53:24,998 --> 00:53:32,443
Additionally, we, you know, we currently operate dispensaries and have really learned over time how to make sure that our

463
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:43,277
operation operates very discreetly and just like a retail store that a layperson may not even know what exactly we're doing unless they were seeking us out to purchase cannabis.

464
00:53:43,938 --> 00:53:52,702
So, for example, there's no odors that are emitted from the store because all of the products are airtight and prepackaged before they arrive at the location.

465
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:58,025
And we don't have, you know, big sample jars open and things like that of cannabis.

466
00:53:58,145 --> 00:54:02,287
It's very professional and discreet in that respect.

467
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:07,802
And that also transitions into our site plan.

468
00:54:07,822 --> 00:54:14,304
So our exterior of the building is, we're certainly going to be beautifying the site, but we're not making it flash in respect to what we do.

469
00:54:14,344 --> 00:54:16,244
There's no cannabis leaves on the exterior.

470
00:54:16,264 --> 00:54:17,745
There's no flashing neon signs.

471
00:54:18,445 --> 00:54:20,445
It's very professional and discreet.

472
00:54:20,545 --> 00:54:25,887
So I definitely understand those concerns, and they're certainly very valid.

473
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:31,068
Most importantly, as we work as partners with the Arts Collaborative,

474
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:43,529
If issues do arise, we're going to be talking very quickly on how to resolve those issues and improve any inconveniences or friction points to make sure that everyone's getting the most they can out of the partnership.

475
00:54:46,031 --> 00:54:46,532
Thank you very much.

476
00:54:46,572 --> 00:54:46,872
Good luck.

477
00:54:48,373 --> 00:54:48,694
Thank you.

478
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:53,718
All right.

479
00:54:54,278 --> 00:54:56,040
I'm going to have May come on.

480
00:54:57,161 --> 00:55:01,264
May Mark Breck, and forgive me again for messing up the pronunciation.

481
00:55:03,062 --> 00:55:03,462
Hi, Meg.

482
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:09,827
Unmute.

483
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:14,491
Yes, I just want to say thank you very much for having this presentation today.

484
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,652
It's been very informative.

485
00:55:17,473 --> 00:55:25,859
The question I have is, I wasn't quite sure, where is this, the marijuana plants going to be grown?

486
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,583
Is that on site or is that at some off site location?

487
00:55:31,624 --> 00:55:33,306
Yeah, that's a good question, May.

488
00:55:33,406 --> 00:55:34,567
Thank you for that question.

489
00:55:34,687 --> 00:55:42,475
So we're a vertically integrated company, which allows us the benefit of cultivating our own cannabis plants.

490
00:55:43,055 --> 00:55:47,520
So we do that in two locations in Massachusetts that are not in Medford.

491
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,723
So there'll be no cannabis cultivated in Medford.

492
00:55:51,444 --> 00:55:52,585
We cultivate indoors.

493
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:59,978
So indoor agriculture in Bridgewater, and then we have an outdoor cannabis farm in Sheffield out in the Berkshires.

494
00:56:00,698 --> 00:56:11,261
So those products are dried, tested, packaged, and then transported to the dispensary for sale, but there's no plants on site.

495
00:56:13,481 --> 00:56:14,181
Thank you, Brandon.

496
00:56:14,441 --> 00:56:23,143
And I'd just like to say how important this will be for Medford and the arts community to finally have a home.

497
00:56:25,426 --> 00:56:25,766
Thank you.

498
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:27,227
We look forward to it.

499
00:56:35,974 --> 00:56:37,115
I'm just going to lower your hand.

500
00:56:37,135 --> 00:56:39,337
And if you have another question, feel free to please raise it again.

501
00:56:40,158 --> 00:56:46,282
The next question or the next hand raised I see is Laurel S. So I'm going to move you from the unmuted.

502
00:56:47,563 --> 00:56:47,984
So Laurel.

503
00:56:49,425 --> 00:56:49,585
Hi.

504
00:56:49,945 --> 00:56:54,489
So I am Laurel Siegel, and I am the current chair of Arts Collaborative Medford.

505
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:01,662
I'm also the president of CACHE, and I just wanted to sort of speak a little bit to Arts Collaborative, if I may, for a moment.

506
00:57:02,582 --> 00:57:11,204
So we are comprised of members of CACHE, the Medford Arts Council, and Arts Medford, as well as other stakeholders in the arts community.

507
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:16,606
And so we're bringing a lot of experience and knowledge of the Medford arts community to the table.

508
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:23,796
And mostly I just wanted to say, take this opportunity to say thank you to Theory for presenting this opportunity.

509
00:57:23,896 --> 00:57:27,760
I think this is a tremendous opportunity for the arts community in Medford.

510
00:57:28,621 --> 00:57:34,588
And I appreciate the generosity and the professionalism of the proposal that's been presented to us.

511
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:38,839
Thank you, Laurel.

512
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:47,581
We appreciate the support and certainly look forward to continuing to work with you and the rest of the team at Arts Collaborative.

513
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:48,501
So thanks again.

514
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:50,302
Thank you.

515
00:57:50,322 --> 00:57:51,742
Thank you, Laurel.

516
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:06,745
Sorry, I'm just kind of correcting the center.

517
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:08,737
So Ken has another question.

518
00:58:08,757 --> 00:58:10,318
I'm going to allow Ken to come back on.

519
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:11,179
Ken?

520
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:13,421
Thank you.

521
00:58:13,441 --> 00:58:14,762
Yeah, just another question that came to mind.

522
00:58:15,882 --> 00:58:19,585
I haven't looked at the traffic study that you referenced.

523
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:28,892
Did that take into account truck traffic to and from the site for both deliveries and anything else that might be

524
00:58:30,584 --> 00:58:39,557
leaving the site by truck and will you be shipping from this location or is it an entirely walk-in type of operation?

525
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:41,686
Yeah, sure.

526
00:58:41,886 --> 00:58:43,648
Good, definitely good questions, Ken.

527
00:58:43,928 --> 00:59:02,987
And just as a reminder to our audience, in general, we do have, or sorry, I should say the City of Medford has posted the full applications of all the candidates for dispensaries in Medford on the city's website, and that would include a copy of our traffic plan.

528
00:59:03,027 --> 00:59:03,968
But essentially,

529
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:12,833
The answer regarding transport is that we will only have a delivery vehicle go to Medford a couple times a week.

530
00:59:13,714 --> 00:59:15,875
So it's not a material impact on traffic.

531
00:59:15,955 --> 00:59:17,936
These are Ford transit vans.

532
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:20,458
They're not 18 wheelers.

533
00:59:20,778 --> 00:59:23,559
I wish we were that busy, but we are not that busy.

534
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:29,322
It's just transit vans that transport cannabis once or twice a week.

535
00:59:29,683 --> 00:59:31,724
There's no outgoing deliveries from Medford.

536
00:59:31,744 --> 00:59:33,605
So it's just incoming deliveries that are done

537
00:59:34,366 --> 00:59:38,113
discreetly, not during business hours at randomized times per day.

538
00:59:38,954 --> 00:59:45,808
And, you know, therefore, just a couple of van deliveries a week don't have any material impact on traffic.

539
00:59:48,006 --> 00:59:48,686
OK, thank you.

540
00:59:48,746 --> 00:59:53,388
And I've tried to download the application, but it's like 108 megabytes.

541
00:59:53,528 --> 00:59:55,709
And so it's very exhaustive.

542
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:59,211
It's a little too much for my little computer to handle.

543
01:00:00,131 --> 01:00:01,852
Yeah, no, it's pretty extensive.

544
01:00:01,892 --> 01:00:04,113
But we've been putting a lot of thought into our proposal.

545
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,974
And that's certainly, I guess, one way is reflected in the length of the application.

546
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:13,437
Thank you, Ken.

547
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,878
I'm just going to clean up the participants link.

548
01:00:19,238 --> 01:00:25,362
OK, I don't have any more questions in the Q&A section, nor do I see any more hands raised.

549
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,524
So just in time, Danny.

550
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:33,067
Danny Leone, are you an MSO, multi-state operator?

551
01:00:35,709 --> 01:00:40,692
So our brand, Theory Wellness, we do operate in the state of Maine as well.

552
01:00:40,772 --> 01:00:47,537
However, this proposal from Theory Wellness Incorporated, we are a Massachusetts-based, Massachusetts-only company.

553
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:55,818
Okay, great.

554
01:01:01,302 --> 01:01:01,983
It's live.

555
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:08,448
Okay, so I'm also, I'm looking in the Q&A section.

556
01:01:08,468 --> 01:01:10,950
I'm also looking in the participants chain for any hands up.

557
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,252
I'm not seeing any at the moment.

558
01:01:13,312 --> 01:01:16,614
I guess we'll do kind of a last call.

559
01:01:17,455 --> 01:01:20,797
There's also contact information if there are any questions that come out.

560
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:23,160
You know, think of anything.

561
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:32,604
I know they've posted an email for them to be reached at, and I'm sure they'd be happy to take up any conversations that come following tonight's meeting.

562
01:01:32,724 --> 01:01:41,509
So any last questions or either from those who wishing to speak or those wishing to enter into the chat?

563
01:01:42,049 --> 01:01:42,749
Thank you.

564
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:43,490
Got one from Ken.

565
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:48,232
Ken Krause asked, can you tell us what the next step is in the selection process?

566
01:01:50,504 --> 01:01:52,866
I imagine that's for Medford, not the state.

567
01:01:53,547 --> 01:02:03,735
Sure, so Medford has a Cannabis Advisory Committee, which is made up of different staff members of the city of Medford.

568
01:02:04,396 --> 01:02:18,547
They are currently evaluating proposals and will be essentially choosing three applicants to recommend to the mayor's office for what's called a host community agreement, and that's the next step in the process.

569
01:02:19,768 --> 01:02:33,855
Our understanding of what's been discussed so far is that those recommendations will be completed by the end of August, and then the mayor presumably will be entering in the host community agreements right after that.

570
01:02:34,035 --> 01:02:47,482
And we can, if we're fortunate enough to be selected, can then apply for our state license, apply for our special permit with the ZBA, and get ready to start construction on the dispensary and the art center.

571
01:02:52,758 --> 01:02:53,378
Thank you, Brandon.

572
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,641
All right, I'll keep that kind of last call open and rolling.

573
01:02:59,562 --> 01:03:00,802
Ken wrote into the Q&A.

574
01:03:00,822 --> 01:03:01,202
Thank you.

575
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:08,486
So I'll kind of keep the last call open for a minute or so if anyone has any more questions.

576
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:16,450
But I think at this time, we just want to thank all of you that have listened, participated, and offered comments or asked questions.

577
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:19,672
This is the type of constructive community dialogue

578
01:03:20,146 --> 01:03:24,048
It's so vital to preserve and maintain strength in a community character.

579
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:26,389
We appreciate everyone who took the time to join us.

580
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:32,972
If you do have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact the applicant at the email found on the presentation screen here.

581
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:35,614
It is community at theorywellness.org.

582
01:03:36,474 --> 01:03:44,798
I want to do one more check of both the Q&A and the participants link to see if there are any last final questions I'm not seeing here.

583
01:03:44,818 --> 01:03:47,620
So again, thank you, Brandon.

584
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,641
I'll kick it over to you if you want to kind of close up

585
01:03:50,607 --> 01:03:51,447
have the final word.

586
01:03:52,568 --> 01:03:53,668
