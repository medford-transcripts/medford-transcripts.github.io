 Estarei moderando o evento desta noite.
 A reunião começará momentaneamente.
 No entanto, esperaremos apenas alguns minutos para permitir que todos participem da reunião.
 Todos os participantes permanecerão em silêncio até a seção de perguntas e respostas no final da apresentação.
 Então nos reuniremos novamente e iniciaremos a reunião em alguns instantes aqui.
 Mas eu só queria avisar a todos que esta noite está sendo gravada e iniciaremos em alguns instantes.
 Então, obrigado.
 Agradecemos sua paciência.
 Ok, vou esperar mais um minuto.
 Então, para iniciar o alcance da comunidade novamente, mas gostaria de dar as boas-vindas a todos em nome da Stereo Wellness para a remodelação da 162 Mystic Avenue, iniciaremos o evento aproximadamente em 504.
 Vou dar a todos mais um minuto para participar.
 Só quero que todos saibam que a reunião desta noite está sendo gravada.
 Para que todos tenham consciência disso.
 Obrigado.
 Bem, vendo o 505, acho que podemos começar por aqui.
 Mais uma vez, boa noite e bem-vindos à reunião de divulgação comunitária, organizada pelo CERI Wellness para a Reconstrução e Uso da 162 Mystic Avenue.
 Meu nome é John Capano.
 Sou advogado de Smith, Costello e Crawford e moderarei o evento desta noite.
 De acordo com a lei de planejamento local e os requisitos estaduais, incluindo a Lei Geral de Massachusetts, Capítulo 94G,
 e a Comissão de Controle de Cannabis de Massachusetts, e esta noite nos referiremos a eles como CCC durante toda a apresentação.
 Tenho certeza disso.
 A reunião desta noite está sendo gravada.
 A gravação em vídeo desta reunião estará disponível em www.seriewellness.org barra invertida MA barra invertida Medford.
 Neste momento, temos 13 participantes na reunião desta noite.
 Próximo slide, por favor.
 A agenda da nossa reunião desta noite é a seguinte.
 Primeiramente, farei apresentações, bem como orientações e informações sobre reuniões.

 Próximo slide, por favor.
 Quanto à forma como esta reunião funcionará,
 Se você quiser fazer uma pergunta, use o ícone de levante a mão na parte inferior da tela para nos informar durante o período de perguntas e respostas.
 Aqueles de vocês que estão ao telefone podem pressionar estrela 9.
 Uma notificação será enviada para mim e avisarei você quando tiver a oportunidade de falar.

 Essas perguntas serão respondidas durante o período de perguntas e respostas.
 Até a sessão de perguntas e respostas, todos os participantes permanecerão em silêncio.
 Próximo slide, por favor.
 Alguns detalhes sobre esta reunião são que o aviso desta reunião pública foi publicado no jornal Medford Transcript em 8 de julho de 2021.
 Todos os vizinhos num raio de 300 pés da Mystic Avenue também receberam um aviso de reunião por correio certificado.
 A cidade de Medford também anunciou esta reunião no site da cidade.
 Algumas pequenas notas rápidas que também gostaria de acrescentar são que a reunião inclui recursos de legendas ocultas para qualquer pessoa que precise deles como parte do status.
 processo de licenciamento, temos que cumprir as diretrizes de acessibilidade da ADA.
 Portanto, são legendas disponíveis para quem precisar delas.
 Acredito que a função esteja localizada na parte inferior da tela, no menu de zoom.
 O candidato também publicou todos os materiais da reunião antes da reunião desta noite com pelo menos 24 horas de antecedência em seu site, como você faz no site visto no slide aqui.
 E finalmente,
 Meu papel na reunião desta noite é o de moderador da reunião, porque o CCC solicita que ninguém envolvido com a licença ou que tenha interesse direto na licença seja o moderador da reunião.
 É aí que entra a nossa empresa.
 Representamos a 3A Wellness aqui em Massachusetts e o CCC nos designou como parte neutra na reunião porque não temos controle direto ou indireto da licença.
 Próximo slide, por favor.
 Ok, ótimo.
 Antes de prosseguirmos para a apresentação, queremos dar-lhes um pequeno contexto sobre o motivo pelo qual estamos reunidos aqui esta noite.
 Em 2016, 57,4% dos eleitores de Medford apoiaram a questão eleitoral para legalizar a maconha recreativa.
 Esta questão também foi aprovada a nível estatal e, graças ao apoio dos residentes de Medford, a cidade tem trabalhado em regras e regulamentos sobre como implementar de forma segura e eficaz a cannabis legal em Medford.
 No ano passado, a Câmara Municipal aprovou um decreto abrangente para permitir até três dispensários recreativos de maconha em Medford.
 Estes podem estar localizados na zona C2 e vários propõem o seu dispensário, bem como a zona industrial.
 Como parte do processo de Medford, a cidade estabeleceu um Comitê Consultivo sobre Cannabis para recomendar ao Gabinete do Prefeito quais organizações e locais são mais adequados para a cidade operar um dispensário de varejo de maconha na cidade.
 Essas recomendações serão enviadas ao Gabinete do Prefeito no final do verão.
 Iniciamos agora a apresentação de Thierry Wilmes.
 Passarei a apresentação a Brandon Pollock, CEO de Thierry.
 Brandon, obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=601.659s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome everyone to our community outreach meeting.
 It is a privilege to be able to discuss our plans with you all this evening, and I very much look forward to the chance to answer your questions and respond to your comments later on in the meeting.
 As a bit of background, I am one of the founders of Theory Wellness, a local cannabis organization that is headquartered in Stoneham.
 We were founded in 2015 and our mission is to create the highest quality dispensary experience for our local communities, our customers, and our employees.
 We have a long and successful track record of operating compliant, safe, and community-centric dispensaries in the Commonwealth, and now employ approximately 300 talented team members here in Massachusetts, providing living wages and a comprehensive benefit package, including a 401k plan.
 We are well known as one of the most respected cannabis organizations in the state, routinely meeting with a variety of cannabis industry stakeholders and regulators to help improve how legal cannabis works here in Massachusetts.
 We take our responsibility to operate as industry leaders very seriously and would be honored to bring our world-class operations to Medford.
 Our first dispensary is a medical only facility that we opened in Bridgewater in 2017.
 We have since then grown to operate two other dispensaries in Massachusetts, one in Chicopee and one in Great Barrington, both of which serve medical patients and adult use customers.
 The Great Barrington location was one of the first recreational stores to open in the state, and that was in January of 2019.
 So this has given us over two years of experience, which is very helpful here in Medford, on how to operate these businesses successfully.
 Thierry also operates indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities and manufactures a wide variety of products.
 In sum, we operate 10 different cannabis licenses here in Massachusetts, which is equal or more to any operational experience of any other business in the state.
 Having at this point served over 1 million different customers in Massachusetts, we look forward to bringing our extensive experience and track record to our South Medford neighborhood.
 Next slide, please.
 After that as well, please.
 So community is very important for us at Theory.
 And that's one of the unique aspects on how we run our business is our approach to community relations.
 We believe the relationship begins by being good listeners, understanding the concerns and desires from all the stakeholders in the community.
 From day one, Theory has listened to and worked closely with our communities to develop positive working relationships that extend from government officials to local businesses, to grassroots organizations, and most importantly, local residents.
 Theory was one of the first cannabis companies in the state to develop a host community agreement, working with the town of Bridgewater since 2016 to share a portion of our revenue with the town to support their municipal programming.
 Since then, Theory has contributed over $8 million in direct financial contributions to our host communities.
 Beyond hiring locally and providing significant economic stimulus, we have focused on building long-term collaborative relationships with municipal governments, as well as local community organizations.
 We have launched an educational series on cannabis, sponsored numerous charitable events, hosted food and clothing drives, and supported over 20 nonprofits in our local communities.
 We look forward to continue on this path with our new project here in Medford.
 Next slide, please.
 So this slide is an overview of our site plan.
 We're proposing a marijuana retailer to be located at 162 Mystic Avenue.
 The site is currently vacant and was previously used as a car dealership.
 Our proposal is to completely renovate and beautify not just the building, but the entire site.
 We searched for over a year to find the perfect location for a dispensary and are extremely happy to be proposing a location at 162 Mystic Ave for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed throughout the presentation.
 These reasons include first and foremost parking.
 This site includes 59 parking stalls with the site plan that you're looking at right now, which is critical to ensure that no traffic issues arise and that we have no nuisance to our neighborhood.
 Number two, the details of the site are pretty unique.
 As shown in the site plan, we have selected a building that has enough space to not just house a dispensary, but also donate 10,000 square feet of space to the arts community, which we will look forward to providing more information on in the upcoming slides.
 Another key benefit of this proposal is that we are able to develop the dispensary in the rear of the building, ensuring that the dispensary is discreetly featured on Mystic Avenue and not front and center.
 Earlier this year, we commissioned a poll of over 250 Medford residents, and it was clear that the majority of residents preferred a dispensary to be discreetly cited like this proposal and not prominently on a main road.
 Next slide, please.
 In respect to zoning compliance, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, Medford has a zoning ordinance that designates the C2 and industrial zones as the two areas in the city where an adult-use dispensary can operate.
 This use is subject to obtaining a special permit from the Zoning Board of Affairs, and there are not regulations from the local health board pertaining to dispensaries.
 That being said, theory has proposed a comprehensive plan to monitor local health impacts and looks forward to working with the Medford Health Department to safely operate our business.
 Our site at 162 Mystic Ave is in the C2 district and is in full compliance with the city's zoning ordinance.
 Importantly, we are over 500 feet away from any K through 12 schools, as shown as a diagram here.
 We have already fully designed our site and construction plans and look forward to working with local builders and contractors when we are ready to construct our facility.
 Renderings of our exterior and interior are provided on the following slides.
 Next slide, please.
 Perfect.
 So this is the proposed exterior of the dispensary.
 As you can see, we, you know, are renovating the entire site and really beautifying the exterior of the building.
 Next slide.
 The proposed interior rendering is where we create a welcoming, bright, and safe environment for our guests.
 Next slide.
 So now we're going to talk about a very interesting partnership we have here with the arts community in Medford.
 A core value of ours, and one of the primary reasons of our success to date, is our steadfast commitment to contributing in meaningful ways to the communities that we operate in.
 In Medford, we are extremely excited and fortunate to be proposing a variety of ways in which we will expect to benefit the community.
 First and foremost, we have established a tremendous partnership with the arts community in Medford.
 For the last six months, we have had discussions with local leaders in the arts community and learned that despite good efforts and intentions, the arts community in Medford has never been able to find a home.
 That will all change with Theory Medford.
 We have committed to donating 10,000 square feet of our building to the Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that will help manage this brand new arts center.
 In addition to providing the space free of charge, Theory will completely renovate the space to the specifications necessary to provide this community benefit.
 This will create studio space, meeting space, office space, and performing space for the arts.
 Our architect has already been working on preliminary floor plans as mentioned on this slide and we couldn't be happier with the partnership and if all goes to plan we would have the community art center up and running in early 2022.
 Next slide.
 Theory understands that diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity are necessary foundational pillars in building a strong team that represents the communities we operate in and facilitates the creation of a value-driven organization.
 Theory also recognizes how the war on drugs disproportionately affected certain communities of color.
 As leaders in the cannabis industry, we have a real responsibility to lead by example, create positive change, and foster opportunities for generational wealth creation for those who have been negatively affected by the unjust historical policies.
 To that end, in 2019 theory launched a first of its kind social equity program, providing $250,000 in no strings attached zero interest financing.
 In addition to resources training and coaching to an economic empowerment applicant who is in the process of launching their own dispensary.
 After interviewing around a dozen qualified applicants, in July of 2019, Theory selected entrepreneurs Vanessa Jean Baptiste and Mark Bouquet of Legal Greens to be the first participants in our program.
 Legal Greens is comprised of these two business partners, both Black, one being a woman, who grew up and reside in neighborhoods that were adversely affected by the war on drugs.
 After nearly two years, in March 2021, Legal Greens opened their recreational dispensary in Brockton, becoming the first Black-owned
 woman-owned recreational dispensary on the East Coast.
 We're very proud of the team at Legal Greens and look forward to replicating this program in Medford if we're fortunate enough to continue on with our project here.
 Additionally, Theory is committed to hiring a diverse workforce in Medford.
 We truly believe that our people is what allows our company to be most successful and that diversity is an asset to any organization.
 proven to foster improved decision-making, increased innovation, stronger customer relationships, and increased employee engagement.
 In Medford, Theory has worked closely with the Mystic branch of the NAACP on a comprehensive diversity hiring plan.
 We are committed to creating a workforce that is at least 50% women, 35% diverse, and 5% veteran, with this goal extending through all management positions.
 Theory offers terrific advancement opportunities and goes through great lengths in our recruitment process to ensure we are hiring without bias or discrimination.
 Next slide, please.
 A major driver of our positive impact in Medford will be economic.
 First, we plan on hiring over 60 well-paid full-time individuals with a mandate that the workforce is diverse and local.
 Specifically, at least 75% of our employees will be Medford residents.
 All team members are provided comprehensive benefits, which include a 401k plan.
 We're especially proud to offer this 401k plan, which right now is not very common in the cannabis industry due to the challenges in working with finding a provider for a program like that.
 As the number one retailer in Massachusetts, we are confident in our projections that each year our Medford dispensary will provide the city with over $2 million in direct cash contributions through both tax revenue and our community host agreement.
 In addition to the commitments to donate to the arts community, Theory has also allocated $50,000 per year to support local nonprofits.
 This is consistent with our track record as we have already support dozens of nonprofits throughout the state.
 Next slide, please.
 We acknowledge and appreciate that one of the possible negative impacts from an adult use dispensary is localized traffic condition.
 In order to meet the economic development goals of the city while simultaneously avoiding any traffic congestion problems, an operator must carefully choose a location that is suitable to handle a high volume of customers.
 There are very few properties within the permitted zones in Medford that provide easy access, have sufficient parking, contain good interior space, and would not materially impact localized traffic.
 This is something that we took very seriously and we're well qualified to analyze having years of experience citing and operating high traffic retail dispensers.
 After looking at dozens of options in Medford for our proposed site, we committed to 162 Mystic Avenue based on a number of factors, including and importantly, the site's ability to serve our projected number of customer visits per day from an access parking and favorable traffic impact perspective.
 Our location is a former car dealership located two minutes off 93 with 59 parking stalls, significantly more than what our projected daily customer visits would demand as further detailed below.
 By comparison, in Great Barrington and Chicopee, where we also operate recreational dispensaries, our location served between 600 and over 1,000 customers per day on busy days with less parking capacity and have had zero material traffic issues to date.
 To demonstrate the suitability of our proposed location, Theory engaged a professional traffic engineering and analysis firm to perform a comprehensive traffic study.
 This 27-page traffic study concluded that our operation of a marijuana retailer at 162 Mystic Avenue would not negatively impact traffic on Mystic Ave.
 Furthermore, as we have done at our other locations, we will work closely with the Medford Police Department to ensure we have a comprehensive traffic control plan in place, including police details as necessary for the initial opening period.
 Next slide, please.
 Our track record and experience showcase that our operational plans and staff training will lead to the safe operations of a marijuana retailer in Medford, including ensuring that diversion and underage sales do not take place at our location.
 We have served over 1 million customers in Massachusetts without any underage sales.
 We check identification three times, once at the door, once in the reception room, and again at the sales counter.
 Furthermore, we use a machine called ID Science that scans each identification for validity.
 This equipment is also used in casinos and updates itself every 30 days with a
 comprehensive database of all valid forms of state ID across the country, as well as all passports in the world.
 By using this machine, we have caught hundreds of expired or invalid forms of identification at our other locations.
 All of our products are secured in the vault, which has extensive security features.
 We are also constantly monitoring our parking areas and have a zero tolerance policy for consumption of cannabis on site.
 Any customers that are found to be consuming on site would be permanently banned from returning to our location.
 Next slide, please.
 An important aspect to discuss is the safety and security that will be designed and implemented at our dispensary.
 It is first helpful to acknowledge and appreciate that Theory has served over a million customers with an excellent safety and security track record.
 And in our other communities, we maintain direct lines of communication with our local law enforcement partners, whom have written letters of recommendation, calling Theory a model for others to follow.
 Our comprehensive safety and security plan would first be reviewed with the Medford Police Department prior to being finalized.
 We always look forward to receiving feedback and improving our plan based on conversations with law enforcement professionals.
 At all times during operational hours, Theory has a highly trained safety and security team that works both inside and outside the dispensary.
 They are there to ensure that no prohibited activities take place on our premise.
 In large part due to our terrific safety and security team, we have not had any nuisance complaints about unsavory customer activity from any of our neighbors at our existing locations.
 Moreover, the dispensary will be outfitted with an extensive alarm and video monitoring system using the most modern technology available.
 This technology is a cornerstone of our safety and security plan and allows us to offer both a welcoming and safe environment for our guests and our neighbors.
 Next slide, please.
 Theory is committed to leading the cannabis industry by taking meaningful measures towards achieving a more sustainable future, despite the level of short-term investment it may require.
 Sustainability is a fundamental value at Theory, woven into our decision-making on a daily basis.
 To date, we have invested millions in energy-reductive technology, effectively offsetting over 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year by moving 90% of our cannabis cultivation operations outdoors, and have greened the majority of our energy usage by purchasing over 85% of our energy from renewable sources.
 Our plan for Medford will push our sustainability actions even further.
 We have a 79-point sustainability action plan consisting of bold measures, including the installation of 263 solar panels on our roof, pledging to electrify our vehicles, obtaining 100% of our company-wide energy needs from renewables, purchasing carbon offsets, sourcing from and supporting local businesses, installing electric vehicle charging stations, incentivizing public transportation,
 using sustainable design and building materials, and sponsoring green entrepreneurship in the city of Medford.
 To hold ourselves accountable, we will establish a director of sustainability and engage with third party consultants to audit our dispensary on a periodic basis.
 Theory admires and respects the City of Medford's ambitious goals relating to sustainability and energy efficiency and believes our operation will align with and contribute meaningfully towards a shared mission.
 We look forward to being a corporate steward and a contributing member of the Medford community.
 Next slide, please.
 Over the years, Thierry has spent extensive time in the Medford community to understand the concerns and desires of Medford residents and businesses relating to the siting and operation of a marijuana retailer.
 Thierry undertook an independent survey of over 250 Medford residents and incorporated their feedback into our proposal, ensuring that our location, our charitable initiatives, and our hiring plans serve the community best.
 Additionally, we have forged a remarkable relationship with local arts community to design, construct, and provide free ongoing use of a 10,000 square foot community center for the arts, a landmark partnership of historic value.
 Thierry has spoken extensively with hundreds of abutters, local businesses, local leaders, and residents, and received tremendous support, evidenced by the over 60 local letters of support that we've received from a variety of locations as shown in the map on this slide.
 To ensure our local relationship only continues to strengthen, Thierry will be hiring a full-time director of community relations whose primary responsibility is fostering and strengthening the quality of our relationship with the community.
 This individual will be based in Medford and will serve as the day-to-day face of Thierry and a conduit for our community relations.
 This is beyond attending and participating in meetings and community events relating to our business.
 They'll also be managing our charitable budget for local nonprofits.
 Next slide, please.
 So to sum it up, I am confident that Theory is the most qualified applicant to operate in Medford for a couple of reasons.
 First, we have the experience necessary to ensure our dispensary in Medford will be world-class.
 We have an industry-leading track record of success and safety at our other operations in Great Barrington, Chicopee, and Bridgewater.
 We have served over 1 million guests without incident, while maintaining a 99 percentile customer rating.
 We have become a model company to our regulators, our host communities, and our customers.
 We have demonstrated that we know exactly how to operate a world-class cannabis dispensary.
 Second, we have an ambitious, progressive, and well-thought-out plan for positive community impacts here in Medford.
 We have created an incredible partnership with the arts community to construct and donate a brand new 10,000 square feet center for the arts, a first-of-its-kind program for the city.
 Moreover, we will be providing over 60 well-paying jobs with full benefits in 401k, supporting local businesses and non-profits, financing local entrepreneurs and social equity applicants, and contributing to the sustainability and diversity goals of the City.
 From a pure economic perspective, we will contribute over $2 million per year to the city in direct payments, amounts we have shown to provide to our other communities.
 Third, after years of scouting, we have carefully chosen a location that we believe makes an ideal site for a dispensary from an infrastructure, traffic, and security standpoint.
 Moreover, our location reflects the desires and priorities of the local community.
 Our location at 162 Mystic Avenue is discreet, has tremendous parking, is located in a C2 district away from residential, and will be completely revitalized through our site beautification plan.
 Having been on the forefront of the industry for years, I appreciate the challenges and unknowns that this new type of business can present.
 With our comprehensive plan for positive impact, industry-leading reputation, and operating experience, I know theory would be the premier choice for the City of Medford.
 I want to thank you all for your attention so far, and now I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan for the question and answer portion of the meeting.
 Thank you, and next slide.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=1956.145s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obrigado, Brandão.
 Bem, como lembrete, de acordo com as leis de planejamento local e os requisitos estaduais, incluindo a Lei Geral de Massachusetts, Capítulo 94G e os regulamentos do CCC, esta reunião é pública e está sendo gravada.
 Eu só queria atualizar a todos sobre as diretrizes da reunião.
 Agora abrirei a parte de comentários públicos e perguntas e respostas da reunião.
 Vou primeiro ler as perguntas e comentários que recebemos dos residentes.
 Portanto, reconhecerei as perguntas que já foram postadas na seção de perguntas e respostas.
 E, finalmente, abriremos para perguntas e respostas gerais.
 Use o ícone de levantar a mão na parte inferior da tela para nos informar se deseja conversar.
 Aqueles de vocês que estão ao telefone podem digitar estrela nove.
 Uma notificação será enviada para mim e avisarei quando for sua vez de fazer sua pergunta ou comentário.
 Você também pode usar o ícone Perguntas e Respostas para inserir uma pergunta para todos os palestrantes verem.
 Em seguida, lerei sua pergunta em voz alta e pedirei que nossos especialistas no assunto respondam a ela.
 Depois de ser reconhecido para falar, você pode ativar ou desativar seu som com o ícone do microfone do rádio no aplicativo Zoom.
 Se houver uma barra vermelha marcada, se houver uma barra vermelha marcada, sua linha está silenciada.
 Então deixe-me ir em frente e parar. Acho que temos oito perguntas e comentários antecipadamente.
 Vou lê-los na ordem em que apareceram.
 Vou permitir que Brandon ou quem quer que seja o especialista no assunto
 uma chance de responder e então passaremos para a próxima pergunta na próxima seção.
 Então isso é de maio.
 May, peço desculpas por pronunciar mal seu sobrenome, mas acho que é Mark Brick.
 Ela escreveu, querida Theory Wellness, como defensora das artes na cidade de Medford por mais de 30 anos e fundadora do CATCH, C-A-T-H-E em Medford:
 Sei em primeira mão o quão importante é para a comunidade artística ter uma casa onde possamos ter encontros, oferecer programas ao público em geral sem cobrança ou taxa mínima, e ter espaço para artistas, estúdios, etc.
 O interesse pelas artes e pela cultura cresceu enormemente na última década, pelo que ter um centro comunitário aumentaria a nossa capacidade de responder a esta tendência.
 Nos últimos cinco anos, os eventos de redução de programas relacionados com as artes aumentaram de 605 eventos para
 para mais de 1.000, um aumento de 65%.
 A oferta de 10.000 pés quadrados de espaço na Mystic Avenue seria a resposta às nossas necessidades e sonhos.
 Cada cidade adjacente à nossa cidade tem um Centro Comunitário para as Artes, por isso apoiamos sinceramente a sua candidatura à cidade de Medford para estabelecer um negócio de revenda para uso adulto que incluirá o fornecimento à Art Collaborative Medford, uma organização sem fins lucrativos, com espaço para um centro comunitário de artes.
 Obrigado em nome de muitas organizações relacionadas com as artes na comunidade pela sua contribuição em apoio às artes.
 Brandon, vou lhe dar a oportunidade, sem dúvida, de comentar o que foi enviado em maio.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2139.428s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Claro.
 Obrigado, Jônatas.
 Direi apenas obrigado, May, por suas amáveis ​​palavras e estamos muito entusiasmados em trabalhar com você e a comunidade artística neste projeto.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2149.717s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Excelente.
 Bem, a próxima pergunta é de Pam Shanley.
 Há algumas perguntas aqui, então lerei a declaração geral feita e, em seguida, analisarei cada pergunta uma por uma.
 Olá, obrigado por fazer isso aqui e por algumas perguntas de Pam, membro do Catch Arts Group em Medford e residente em Medford.
 Primeiro, qual é a relação potencial com o dispensário e o Medford Arts Group?
 Brandon, se você quiser resumir esse relacionamento, sei que foi abordado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2185.371s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, agiríamos essencialmente como proprietários e cederíamos o espaço gratuitamente, bem como construiríamos o Centro de Artes de acordo com as especificações apresentadas pela Arts Collaborative.
 Não teríamos nenhum controle operacional ou envolvimento além de simplesmente sermos proprietários, onde oferecemos aluguel gratuito à comunidade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2211.02s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Excelente.
 A próxima questão aqui é: eles teriam liberdade para alugar o espaço para aulas de arte, shows e festas?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2218.666s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, absolutamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2222.269s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Quem dirigiria o Medford Art Group ou eles terão a liberdade de fazer qualquer coisa dentro dos limites?
 Quais seriam esses limites potenciais?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2231.896s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Então não posso falar muito sobre a gestão do Arts Collaborative na nossa perspectiva.
 Quero dizer, é uma organização sem fins lucrativos que parece ser muito bem administrada, com um grupo diversificado de pessoas trabalhando nela.
 E do meu ponto de vista, eles têm a liberdade de utilizar os espaços que consideram ser o melhor uso para a comunidade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2257.742s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: A próxima pergunta é curta.
 O Wi-Fi estará disponível?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2261.113s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Ah, sim, absolutamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2263.555s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: OK, tudo bem.
 Os dois últimos.
 Quais são os horários em que as artes, quais são os horários em que o grupo artístico de Medford teria acesso ao prédio?
 Uh, isso seria 24 sete?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2275.425s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim.
 Sim.
 É um espaço completamente separado do dispensário e eles teriam controle total sobre quantas vezes desejam que as pessoas acessem o espaço.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2285.853s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Excelente.
 E então a última pergunta foi sobre estacionamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2289.263s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, estarão estacionando vagas convencionais e acessíveis para ADA bem em frente ao Centro de Artes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2296.666s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Ótimo, obrigado Brandon e obrigado Pam por enviar sua pergunta.
 Vejo você aqui na reunião também, então estou feliz por termos tido a oportunidade de responder sua pergunta.
 Bem, a terceira pergunta é de Cindy Watson.
 Há muitas pesquisas que indicam que as artes são um salva-vidas, mas, inversamente, uma morte.
 de espaço para acomodar arte.
 Em agosto passado, declarou o presidente Biden, o futuro de quem somos está na arte.
 É a expressão da nossa alma.
 Esta declaração profunda é um alerta sobre a necessidade de alocar dinheiro do orçamento federal para financiar as artes e a cultura.
 Vou ler isto com atenção, mas apenas para registro, para as perguntas e respostas, e para
 Para ter oportunidade de falar, tentarei falar um pouco mais sobre o tema Teoria do Bem-Estar e seu envolvimento na comunidade.
 Contudo, agradeço os comentários feitos aqui e esta mensagem que recebemos.
 Portanto, esta declaração profunda é um alerta sobre a necessidade de alocar dinheiro do orçamento federal para financiar as artes e a cultura.
 Atualmente, os Estados Unidos estão muito atrás dos seus homólogos europeus no financiamento das artes.
 Ele exagerou essa necessidade.
 Artistas de todo o mundo apoiam esta ideia e expressam esta comovente mensagem.
 O que sei dos últimos 15 meses é sobre destacar o que há de mais sombrio, fazer alegria, fazer o bem em todas as oportunidades, ver beleza todos os dias no trabalho de artistas que acreditam que nos ajudarão a nos reencontrar.
 Isso me ajuda e talvez você também.
 Acredito que a arte nos ajudará a lidar com a nossa perda quando o oceano não conseguir conter a nossa dor.
 Citação muito boa.
 O bem-estar da cidade deve ser elogiado pelos seus esforços para colaborar com a comunidade artística para fornecer o espaço tão necessário.
 Eles reconhecem a necessidade de defender a nossa causa.
 Tenho esperança de que esta parceria se concretize.
 Sem dúvida, colocará um sorriso no rosto de todos, porque é verdadeiramente a linguagem universal.
 Então, obrigado Cindy.
 Oferecerei a Brandon a oportunidade de responder a isso também.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2432.47s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, repita isso, Jonathan.
 Obrigado.
 Obrigado Cindy.
 Agradecemos as amáveis ​​palavras e também aguardamos ansiosamente a parceria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2443.914s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Bem, a próxima pergunta é de Robert García.
 Chefe do balão, não sei se é marca ou, me perdoe por isso.
 Mas quem se importa, a Theory Wellness é uma das empresas de maconha mais lucrativas de Massachusetts.
 Eles estão no mercado há mais de quatro anos em Bridgewater, Chicopee e Great Barrington.
 Ele seria o melhor parceiro financeiro de cannabis para Medford e para nós, contribuintes.
 Pelo que entendi, eles têm que pagar para ver 3% do lucro bruto.
 Nenhum outro candidato chega perto deles.
 Então nós podemos.
 Não há dúvida sobre isso.
 Mas, novamente, oferecerei a Brandon a oportunidade de responder.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2481.071s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, obrigado, Jônatas.
 E acho que sim, acho que ele é dono de uma empresa local.
 E para esclarecer, do ponto de vista económico, vamos na verdade partilhar 6% das nossas receitas, não dos lucros, portanto, uma quantia ainda mais significativa de dinheiro com a cidade, o que deverá ajudar a aliviar a carga sobre outros contribuintes, todo o resto será resolvido.
 Portanto, certamente esperamos ajudar a comunidade dessa forma.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2506.076s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Excelente.
 Bem, isto é de Sylvia García.
 Eu, Sylvia García, apoio
 Teoria do bem-estar e seu aplicativo para citar um dispensário de cannabis no Mystic App porque vi seus planos e o prédio está lindo.
 Gosto particularmente de como o negócio de cannabis está localizado na parte de trás do prédio, longe da rua e fora da vista de todos, enquanto a frente do prédio terá um uso separado não relacionado à maconha.
 Então, e isso vem de
 Sylvia, que mora em Medford.
 Não vou publicar o endereço dele, mas ele assinou como residente, o que agradecemos.
 Mais uma vez, Brandon, vou oferecer-lhe a oportunidade de responder.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2547.392s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Não, agradecemos o comentário, Sylvia.
 Obrigado pelo seu apoio.
 E certamente concordamos que, como mencionou, quando fizemos um extenso inquérito aos residentes de Medford no início deste ano, ouvimos em alto e bom som que as pessoas querem que os adultos consumam cannabis, mas querem-na num local discreto, que temos a oportunidade perfeita para fornecer aqui.
 Então, obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2570.233s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obrigado, Brandão.
 isso é de
 Melissa Miguel, outra moradora de Medford, não quero reler o discurso inteiro.
 Ela escreveu às autoridades municipais: Estou escrevendo hoje para mostrar meu apoio à teoria do bem-estar e à proposta de localização na Mystic Avenue, em South Medford.
 Como residente de longa data de South Medford, tenho o prazer de ver o interesse de um Parceiro de Bairro Responsável e de um Parceiro de Bairro Responsável interessado em fazer negócios no nosso bairro.
 Eles têm uma grande história com a maconha em Massachusetts e levam a segurança muito a sério.
 Eles fornecem vigilância 24 horas por dia de sua propriedade e garantem que a privacidade da propriedade privada na área circundante não seja violada.
 Medford fez um péssimo trabalho ao atrair empresas para a área de South Medford e espero que isso esteja mudando com a aprovação do Dairy Wellness na Mystic Avenue.
 Mais uma vez, Brandon, vou oferecer-lhe a oportunidade de comentar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2629.179s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, não, agradecemos o apoio, Melissa.
 Certamente acreditamos e concordamos com você que nossa presença na 162 Mystic Ave aumentaria a segurança geral do bairro e também proporcionaria novos clientes a outras empresas locais que farão compras conosco.
 Certamente esses clientes também visitarão os nossos vizinhos.
 É por isso que achamos que é benéfico para a comunidade empresarial de South Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2659.97s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Brilhante.
 A próxima pergunta é de Jonathan Fagan.
 Ele diz, olá de novo.
 Meu nome é Jonathan Fagan.
 Sou membro do conselho do CATCH e fundador do Medford Jazz Festival.
 Quero reiterar o meu apoio à candidatura da Siri Wellness antes da reunião de hoje, especialmente tendo em conta a sua proposta de dedicar 10.000 pés quadrados de espaço artístico à comunidade, um novo espaço que apoia tanto as artes performativas como as visuais numa base paga.
 um enorme papel na revitalização de toda a comunidade artística, especialmente considerando o número de espaços que fecharam nos últimos meses.
 A vitrine na Mystic Avenue proporcionaria a visibilidade necessária, especialmente para pintores e outros artistas que desejam mostrar seu trabalho para a comunidade em geral.
 Mantenha-me informado sobre a reunião, como está indo a reunião e diga-me o que mais posso fazer para ajudar melhor Johnson.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2712.832s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, não, obrigado, Jônatas.
 Agradecemos as amáveis ​​palavras e apoio e certamente esperamos ter a oportunidade de proporcionar um espaço para as artes.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2728.183s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Excelente.
 Bom, a última pergunta enviada é da Jéssica Rubitico.
 Desculpe se pronunciei mal o sobrenome lá.
 Estou muito feliz em apoiar a teoria do bem-estar na Mystic Ave.
 Eles foram além ao trazer as artes de Medford para seu site na Mystic Avenue.
 As artes em Medford nunca tiveram um lar e já era hora.
 Obrigado Siri, nós amamos você.
 Isto é de Jessica e ela mora em Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2759.583s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, obrigado, Jéssica.
 Agradecemos imensamente o apoio e ficaríamos muito felizes e afortunados se pudéssemos continuar avançando com o projeto e colocar o Centro de Artes em funcionamento.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2771.817s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Ótimo, obrigado Brandon.
 Isso conclui as questões que foram apresentadas antecipadamente.
 Passarei agora para a seção de perguntas e respostas.
 Quero apenas deixar registrado que temos 18 pessoas presentes na reunião neste momento.
 Isto é de Brenda Bree.
 Com qual organização artística de Medford você está fazendo parceria?
 Acho que vamos esclarecer isso novamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2793.761s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, a organização se chama Arts Collaborative.
 É uma organização sem fins lucrativos recém-criada que
 Eu entendo que é uma espécie de colaboração entre vários grupos artísticos existentes em Medford que estão se unindo para trabalhar juntos para, você sabe, nos ajudar a projetar o espaço para a comunidade artística e então seriam eles que estariam tecnicamente sublocando o espaço da teoria de graça.
 Então Arts Collaborative é o nome da organização artística com a qual trabalhamos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2825.547s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obrigado, Brandão.
 Próxima pergunta... Ok, ótimo.
 Desculpe, este é um pequeno território novo aqui.
 Danny Leon pergunta: Brandon pode esclarecer sua propriedade no Temescal Wellness?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2847.619s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, acho que isso... Estive envolvido com uma empresa chamada Temescal Wellness como uma organização sem fins lucrativos no estado de New Hampshire.
 há muitos, muitos anos.
 Não tenho propriedade, envolvimento, controle ou conhecimento de nada relacionado ao 10 Minutes of Wellness em Massachusetts.
 Então não, não há nenhuma propriedade lá.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2870.754s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obrigado, Brandão.
 Outro de Dan Leon, você pode explicar a propriedade da Theory Farms?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2881.58s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Então Theory Farms, esse foi um projeto que eu e alguns dos outros fundadores da Theory
 Tudo começou há vários anos, quando obteve uma licença provisória.
 Nunca avançamos com o projeto e realmente nos livramos dessa licença.
 Portanto, não conheço a propriedade atual da Theory Farms, embora acredite que assim que adquiriram a licença mudaram de nome para outro nome.
 Mas atualmente não temos interesse em Fazendas Teóricas.
 OK.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2913.761s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obrigado Brendan.
 A última pergunta e resposta é de Brenda Breath.
 Como será dividido o estacionamento entre o dispensário e o espaço de arte?
 Serão reservados alguns espaços para cada um?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2925.963s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, penso que à medida que finalizarmos o nosso plano de localização e o nosso plano de desenvolvimento com a colaboração artística, poderemos falar mais sobre como queremos gerir o estacionamento.
 Hum, acho que geralmente queremos ter certeza de que há estacionamento reservado para, hum, para artes colaborativas, hum, sempre que precisarem, você sabe, bem na frente do espaço.
 E então, se eles realizarem eventos maiores, acho que gostaríamos de ter um relacionamento colaborativo com nossa equipe de gerenciamento de dispensários para garantir que estamos preparados para lidar com isso.
 Um evento maior, se puder afetar nossas próprias operações, certamente podemos lidar com isso com a quantidade de estacionamento que temos no local e podemos, você sabe, usar alavancas como fazer com que nossa equipe estacione do outro lado da rua por um dia ou algo assim, se necessário.
 Mas com 59 vagas de estacionamento no local, estou realmente confiante de que não teremos problemas de estacionamento e estaremos, você sabe, muito bem preparados para garantir que todos possam encontrar uma vaga de estacionamento de forma rápida e fácil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2981.528s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Excelente.
 Obrigado, Brandão.
 Não vendo mais perguntas na seção de perguntas e respostas do chat do Zoom, passarei para aquelas com as mãos levantadas.
 Então vou procurar Ken Krause.
 Ken, permitiremos que você abra seu microfone e vídeo, se desejar.
 Então Ken.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3002.521s">[Krause]</a>: Você pode me ouvir?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3003.862s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3004.522s">[Krause]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 Sim, Ken Krause.
 Residente em Medford há 21 anos.
 Estive envolvido com organizações artísticas e ambientais em particular durante esse período.
 Estou muito entusiasmado com as perspectivas para o Centro de Artes, que tem sido um esforço contínuo de pessoas da comunidade artística há provavelmente 15 anos.
 O Arts Collaborative Medford foi
 nele por vários anos, olhando alguns lugares.
 Isso é muito emocionante.
 Também estou satisfeito com a ênfase na sustentabilidade da propriedade.
 Então eu tenho duas perguntas.
 O primeiro,
 é provavelmente a resposta mais curta.
 Relativamente à construção do imóvel, não vi nenhuma árvore na breve imagem que foi apresentada.
 No geral, há uma grave falta de árvores ao longo da Mystic Avenue e estou me perguntando se você tem o plano de paisagismo a ponto de saber se há potencial ou se tem planos de adicionar árvores à propriedade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3066.07s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, obrigado, Ken.
 Este é Brandon.
 Eu posso responder isso.
 Em primeiro lugar, obrigado pelo seu apoio e respeito pelo lado artístico das coisas.
 Nick e eu, os fundadores da Theory, realmente nos preocupamos com a sustentabilidade e apreciamos o comentário sobre a cobertura arbórea.
 Nosso plano de paisagismo não está finalizado, então certamente posso levar isso em consideração.
 Acho que certamente queremos adicionar
 adicione isso à paisagem.
 Você sabe, há algumas advertências.
 Não queremos bloquear nossas câmeras ou coisas assim do ponto de vista da segurança, mas certamente há áreas do local que poderiam usar alguma cobertura de árvores que deveria adicionar alguma sombra.
 Então eu acho que esse é um ótimo ponto.
 E a boa notícia é que ainda não finalizamos o plano de paisagismo.
 Portanto, certamente podemos levar isso em consideração.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3109.836s">[Krause]</a>: Bem obrigado.
 A minha segunda pergunta é que tenho conversado com pessoas da comunidade de recuperação e elas estão muito interessadas em poder apoiar confortavelmente o Centro de Arte e participar em eventos lá, talvez ter um estúdio lá.
 E as suas preocupações têm estado relacionadas com a confiança de que conseguirão viver confortavelmente
 visite um local tão próximo do dispensário logo atrás dele.
 E você falou algumas coisas sobre o espaço ser totalmente separado, o que eu acho importante, e também a política rígida de não consumo no local.
 Gostaria de saber se você poderia falar um pouco mais sobre como será a configuração em termos de espaços contíguos e existem espaços compartilhados?
 Existem entradas separadas?
 Mais algum detalhe para nos ajudar a entender como as duas entidades funcionarão juntas, mas separadamente?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3183.104s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, não, obrigado, Ken.
 Essa é uma pergunta muito boa.
 Alguns pontos para responder.
 Primeiro, são espaços totalmente diferentes e na verdade haverá uma espécie de área de armazenamento vazia, potencialmente, você sabe, entre eles, mas não há absolutamente nenhum acesso de um espaço ao outro.
 Entradas totalmente separadas também.
 Além disso, atualmente operamos dispensários e, com o tempo, aprendemos realmente como garantir que nossos
 A operação funciona de forma muito discreta e como uma loja de varejo, então um leigo pode nem saber exatamente o que estamos fazendo, a menos que esteja nos procurando para comprar cannabis.
 Assim, por exemplo, a loja não emite odores porque todos os produtos são herméticos e pré-embalados antes de chegarem ao local.
 E não temos, você sabe, grandes potes abertos de amostras e coisas como cannabis.
 Ele é muito profissional e discreto nesse sentido.
 E isso também se aplica ao nosso plano de site.
 Então o nosso exterior do prédio certamente embelezaremos o local, mas não deixaremos chamativo o que fazemos.
 Não há folhas de cannabis lá fora.
 Não há sinais de néon piscando.
 Ele é muito profissional e discreto.
 Eu definitivamente entendo essas preocupações e elas são certamente muito válidas.
 Mais importante ainda, como trabalhamos como parceiros da Arts Collaborative,
 Se surgirem problemas, conversaremos rapidamente sobre como resolvê-los e melhorar quaisquer problemas ou pontos de atrito para garantir que todos aproveitem ao máximo a parceria.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3286.031s">[Krause]</a>: Muito obrigado.
 Boa sorte.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3288.373s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3293.357s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Tudo bem.
 Vou fazer com que maio chegue.
 Esse Mark Breck, e me perdoe novamente por bagunçar a pronúncia.
 Olá Meg.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3307.686s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: Ative o mudo.
 Sim, só quero agradecer muito por fazer esta apresentação hoje.
 Foi muito informativo.
 A pergunta que tenho é: não tinha certeza: onde as plantas de maconha serão cultivadas?
 É no local ou em algum lugar externo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3331.624s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, essa é uma boa pergunta, May.
 Obrigado por essa pergunta.
 Portanto, somos uma empresa verticalmente integrada, o que nos permite o benefício de cultivar as nossas próprias plantas de cannabis.
 Então fazemos isso em dois locais em Massachusetts que não ficam em Medford.
 Portanto, nenhuma cannabis será cultivada em Medford.
 Nós crescemos dentro de casa.
 Portanto, temos agricultura interna em Bridgewater e uma fazenda de cannabis ao ar livre em Sheffield, em Berkshires.
 Então esses produtos são secos, testados, embalados e depois transportados para o dispensário para venda, mas não há fábricas no local.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3373.481s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: Obrigado, Brandão.
 E gostaria apenas de dizer o quão importante será para Medford e a comunidade artística finalmente terem um lar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3385.426s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Obrigado.
 Estamos ansiosos por isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3395.974s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Só vou abaixar sua mão.
 E se você tiver outra dúvida, fique à vontade para perguntar novamente.
 A próxima pergunta ou a próxima mão que vejo é Laurel S. Então, vou tirar você do modo ativado.
 Então Laurel.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3409.425s">[Laurel Siegel]</a>: Olá.
 Sou Laurel Siegel e sou a atual presidente da Arts Collaborative Medford.
 Também sou o presidente do CACHE e queria apenas conversar um pouco com a Arts Collaborative, se me permitem, por um momento.
 Portanto, somos compostos por membros do CACHE, do Medford Arts Council e do Arts Medford, bem como de outras partes interessadas na comunidade artística.
 É por isso que estamos trazendo muita experiência e conhecimento da comunidade artística de Medford.
 E principalmente eu só queria dizer: aproveito para agradecer à Teoria por apresentar esta oportunidade.
 Acho que esta é uma tremenda oportunidade para a comunidade artística de Medford.
 E agradeço a generosidade e o profissionalismo da proposta que nos foi apresentada.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3458.059s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Obrigado Laurel.
 Agradecemos o apoio e certamente esperamos continuar a trabalhar com você e o restante da equipe Arts Collaborative.
 Então, obrigado novamente.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3470.322s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obrigado Laurel.
 Desculpe, estou apenas corrigindo o centro.
 Então Ken tem outra pergunta.
 Vou deixar Ken voltar.
 Conhecido?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3493.12s">[Krause]</a>: Obrigado.
 Sim, apenas mais uma pergunta que me veio à mente.
 Não olhei o estudo de tráfego que você mencionou.
 Isso levou em consideração o tráfego de caminhões de e para o local, tanto para entregas quanto para qualquer outra coisa que pudesse ser
 Você transportará o local e enviará a partir deste local ou será uma operação totalmente presencial?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3521.245s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim claro.
 Boas, definitivamente boas perguntas, Ken.
 E apenas como um lembrete para o nosso público, em geral, temos, ou sinto muito, devo dizer que a cidade de Medford publicou as inscrições completas de todos os candidatos a dispensários em Medford no site da cidade, e isso incluiria uma cópia do nosso plano de tráfego.
 Mas essencialmente,
 A resposta em relação ao transporte é que teremos apenas um veículo de entrega que irá a Medford algumas vezes por semana.
 Portanto, não é um impacto material no tráfego.
 Estas são vans Ford Transit.
 Eles não são veículos de 18 rodas.
 Eu gostaria que estivéssemos tão ocupados, mas não estamos tão ocupados.
 São apenas vans de trânsito que transportam cannabis uma ou duas vezes por semana.
 Não há entregas de Medford.
 Portanto, apenas as entregas recebidas são feitas.
 discretamente, não durante o horário comercial, em horários aleatórios do dia.
 E, portanto, apenas algumas entregas de van por semana não têm impacto material no trânsito.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3588.006s">[Krause]</a>: Tudo bem, obrigado.
 Tentei baixar o aplicativo, mas tem cerca de 108 megabytes.
 E é por isso que é muito exaustivo.
 É demais para o meu pequeno computador aguentar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3600.131s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Sim, não, é bastante extenso.
 Mas temos pensado muito na nossa proposta.
 E acho que essa é certamente uma maneira de refletir sobre a duração da solicitação.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3612.856s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obrigado Ken.
 Vou apenas limpar o link dos participantes.
 Bem, não tenho mais perguntas nas perguntas e respostas, nem vejo mais mãos levantadas.
 Bem na hora, Danny.
 Danny Leone, você é um operador MSO multiestadual?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3635.709s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Portanto, nossa marca, Theory Wellness, também atua no estado do Maine.
 Porém, nesta proposta da Theory Wellness Incorporated, somos uma empresa sediada em Massachusetts, exclusivamente em Massachusetts.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3655.418s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Ok, ótimo.
 Está ao vivo.
 Bem, também estou olhando a seção de perguntas e respostas.
 Também estou olhando a cadeia de participantes para ver se alguém levanta a mão.
 Não vejo nenhum no momento.
 Acho que faremos uma espécie de última chamada.
 Também há informações de contato caso surja alguma dúvida.
 Você sabe, pense em qualquer coisa.
 Sei que eles postaram um e-mail para contatá-los e tenho certeza de que ficarão felizes em atender qualquer conversa que surgir após a reunião desta noite.
 Então, alguma última pergunta de quem quer conversar ou de quem quer entrar no chat?
 Obrigado.
 Recebi um de Ken.
 Ken Krause perguntou: Você pode nos dizer qual é o próximo passo no processo de seleção?
 Imagino que isso seja para Medford, não para o estado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3713.547s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Claro, Medford tem um Comitê Consultivo sobre Cannabis, composto por diferentes funcionários da cidade de Medford.
 Eles estão atualmente avaliando propostas e irão essencialmente escolher três candidatos para recomendar ao gabinete do prefeito para o chamado acordo da comunidade anfitriã, e esse é o próximo passo no processo.
 Nosso entendimento é que o que foi discutido até agora é que essas recomendações serão concluídas até o final de agosto e então, presumivelmente, o prefeito celebrará acordos com a comunidade anfitriã imediatamente depois disso.
 E podemos, se tivermos a sorte de sermos selecionados, solicitar nossa licença estadual, solicitar nossa licença especial junto à ZBA e nos preparar para iniciar a construção do dispensário e do centro de arte.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3772.758s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: Obrigado, Brandão.
 Tudo bem, vou manter esse tipo de última chamada aberta e em andamento.
 Ken escreveu nas perguntas e respostas.
 Obrigado.
 Então, manterei a última ligação aberta por cerca de um minuto se alguém tiver mais alguma dúvida.
 Mas acho que agora só queremos agradecer a todos que ouviram, participaram e fizeram comentários ou fizeram perguntas.
 Este é o tipo de diálogo comunitário construtivo
 É muito vital preservar e manter a força do caráter comunitário.
 Agradecemos a todos que reservaram um tempo para se juntar a nós.
 Se você tiver mais dúvidas, sinta-se à vontade para entrar em contato com o candidato pelo endereço de e-mail na tela inicial aqui.
 É uma comunidade emorywellness.org.
 Quero fazer mais uma verificação no link de perguntas e respostas e no link dos participantes para ver se há alguma pergunta final que não vejo aqui.
 Obrigado mais uma vez, Brandon.
 Vou passar para você se quiser encerrar.
 tenha a última palavra.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3832.568s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: Claro que não, obrigado Jonathan.
 Simplesmente obrigado a todos pela atenção e presença na reunião.
 Estamos ansiosos pela oportunidade de sermos membros da comunidade de Medford aqui.
 Estamos empenhados em operar um dispensário verdadeiramente de classe mundial que beneficie a comunidade de várias maneiras importantes.
 E como Jonathan mencionou, não hesite em nos contatar se tiver alguma coisa em mente.
