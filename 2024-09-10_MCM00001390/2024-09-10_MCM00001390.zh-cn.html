 我的名字是约翰·卡帕诺。
 我将主持今晚的活动。
 会议马上开始。
 但是，我们只会等待几分钟，以便每个人都可以加入会议。
 所有参与者将保持沉默，直到演示结束的问答部分。
 然后我们稍后将在这里重新召集并开始会议。
 但我只是想让大家知道今晚正在录制中，我们将在稍后开始。
 所以谢谢你。
 我们感谢您的耐心等待。
 好的，我再等一分钟。
 因此，再次开始社区外展活动，但我想代表 Stereo Wellness 欢迎大家参与神秘大道 162 号的改造，我们将在 504 左右开始活动。
 我再给大家一分钟的时间来参与。
 我只是想让大家知道今晚的会议正在录制中。
 让大家都知道这一点。
 谢谢。
 好吧，看到 505，我想我们可以从这里开始。
 再次，晚上好，欢迎参加由 CERI Wellness 主办的关于神秘大道 162 号重建和使用的社区外展会议。
 我的名字是约翰·卡帕诺。
 我是史密斯、科斯特洛和克劳福德的律师，我将主持今晚的活动。
 根据当地规划法和州要求，包括马萨诸塞州普通法第 94G 章，
 和马萨诸塞州大麻管制委员会，今晚我们将在整个演示过程中将它们称为 CCC。
 我确信这一点。
 今晚的会议正在录制中。
 本次会议的视频录制可在 www.seriewellness.org backslash MA backslash Medford 上获取。
 目前今晚的会议有 13 名参与者。
 请下一张幻灯片。
 我们今晚会议的议程如下。
 首先，我将提供演示以及有关会议的指导和信息。
 下面，我将概述在梅德福开设大麻药房的过程。
 接下来，Area Wellness 将介绍您的组织和项目。
 然后我们将有一个问答时间来回答你们今晚可能提出的任何问题。
 请下一张幻灯片。
 至于这次会议将如何进行，
 如果您想提出问题，请在问答期间使用屏幕底部的举手图标告知我们。
 打电话的人可以按星号 9。
 我们将向我发送通知，当我有机会发言时我会通知您。
 您还可以随时使用 Zoom 上的问答功能输入您的问题。

 我相信该功能位于屏幕底部的缩放菜单中。
 该候选人还至少提前 24 小时在其网站上发布了今晚会议之前的所有会议材料，正如您在此处幻灯片中看到的网站上所做的那样。
 最后，
 我在今晚的会议上的角色是会议主持人，因为 CCC 要求任何涉及许可证或与许可证有直接利益的人都不能担任会议主持人。
 这就是我们公司的用武之地。
 我们在马萨诸塞州代表 3A Wellness，CCC 在会议上指定我们为中立方，因为我们对许可证没有直接或间接控制权。
 请下一张幻灯片。
 好的，太好了。
 在我们开始演讲之前，我们想向您提供一些背景信息，说明我们今晚聚集在这里的原因。
 2016年，57.4%的梅德福选民支持休闲大麻合法化的投票问题。
 这一问题也得到了州一级的批准，并且在梅德福居民的支持下，该市一直在制定有关如何在梅德福安全有效地实施合法大麻的规则和条例。
 去年，市议会批准了一项全面法令，允许在梅德福开设最多三个休闲大麻药房。
 这些可以位于 C2 区，其中一些建议设有药房以及工业区。
 作为梅德福进程的一部分，该市成立了大麻咨询委员会，向市长办公室推荐最适合该市经营零售大麻药房的组织和地点。
 这些建议将于夏末发送至市长办公室。
 我们现在开始蒂埃里·威尔姆斯的演讲。
 我将把演讲交给 Thierry 首席执行官布兰登·波洛克 (Brandon Pollock)。
 布兰登，谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=601.659s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>:  Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome everyone to our community outreach meeting.
 It is a privilege to be able to discuss our plans with you all this evening, and I very much look forward to the chance to answer your questions and respond to your comments later on in the meeting.
 As a bit of background, I am one of the founders of Theory Wellness, a local cannabis organization that is headquartered in Stoneham.
 We were founded in 2015 and our mission is to create the highest quality dispensary experience for our local communities, our customers, and our employees.
 We have a long and successful track record of operating compliant, safe, and community-centric dispensaries in the Commonwealth, and now employ approximately 300 talented team members here in Massachusetts, providing living wages and a comprehensive benefit package, including a 401k plan.
 We are well known as one of the most respected cannabis organizations in the state, routinely meeting with a variety of cannabis industry stakeholders and regulators to help improve how legal cannabis works here in Massachusetts.
 We take our responsibility to operate as industry leaders very seriously and would be honored to bring our world-class operations to Medford.
 Our first dispensary is a medical only facility that we opened in Bridgewater in 2017.
 We have since then grown to operate two other dispensaries in Massachusetts, one in Chicopee and one in Great Barrington, both of which serve medical patients and adult use customers.
 The Great Barrington location was one of the first recreational stores to open in the state, and that was in January of 2019.
 So this has given us over two years of experience, which is very helpful here in Medford, on how to operate these businesses successfully.
 Thierry also operates indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities and manufactures a wide variety of products.
 In sum, we operate 10 different cannabis licenses here in Massachusetts, which is equal or more to any operational experience of any other business in the state.
 Having at this point served over 1 million different customers in Massachusetts, we look forward to bringing our extensive experience and track record to our South Medford neighborhood.
 Next slide, please.
 After that as well, please.
 So community is very important for us at Theory.
 And that's one of the unique aspects on how we run our business is our approach to community relations.
 We believe the relationship begins by being good listeners, understanding the concerns and desires from all the stakeholders in the community.
 From day one, Theory has listened to and worked closely with our communities to develop positive working relationships that extend from government officials to local businesses, to grassroots organizations, and most importantly, local residents.
 Theory was one of the first cannabis companies in the state to develop a host community agreement, working with the town of Bridgewater since 2016 to share a portion of our revenue with the town to support their municipal programming.
 Since then, Theory has contributed over $8 million in direct financial contributions to our host communities.
 Beyond hiring locally and providing significant economic stimulus, we have focused on building long-term collaborative relationships with municipal governments, as well as local community organizations.
 We have launched an educational series on cannabis, sponsored numerous charitable events, hosted food and clothing drives, and supported over 20 nonprofits in our local communities.
 We look forward to continue on this path with our new project here in Medford.
 Next slide, please.
 So this slide is an overview of our site plan.
 We're proposing a marijuana retailer to be located at 162 Mystic Avenue.
 The site is currently vacant and was previously used as a car dealership.
 Our proposal is to completely renovate and beautify not just the building, but the entire site.
 We searched for over a year to find the perfect location for a dispensary and are extremely happy to be proposing a location at 162 Mystic Ave for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed throughout the presentation.
 These reasons include first and foremost parking.
 This site includes 59 parking stalls with the site plan that you're looking at right now, which is critical to ensure that no traffic issues arise and that we have no nuisance to our neighborhood.
 Number two, the details of the site are pretty unique.
 As shown in the site plan, we have selected a building that has enough space to not just house a dispensary, but also donate 10,000 square feet of space to the arts community, which we will look forward to providing more information on in the upcoming slides.
 Another key benefit of this proposal is that we are able to develop the dispensary in the rear of the building, ensuring that the dispensary is discreetly featured on Mystic Avenue and not front and center.
 Earlier this year, we commissioned a poll of over 250 Medford residents, and it was clear that the majority of residents preferred a dispensary to be discreetly cited like this proposal and not prominently on a main road.
 Next slide, please.
 In respect to zoning compliance, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, Medford has a zoning ordinance that designates the C2 and industrial zones as the two areas in the city where an adult-use dispensary can operate.
 This use is subject to obtaining a special permit from the Zoning Board of Affairs, and there are not regulations from the local health board pertaining to dispensaries.
 That being said, theory has proposed a comprehensive plan to monitor local health impacts and looks forward to working with the Medford Health Department to safely operate our business.
 Our site at 162 Mystic Ave is in the C2 district and is in full compliance with the city's zoning ordinance.
 Importantly, we are over 500 feet away from any K through 12 schools, as shown as a diagram here.
 We have already fully designed our site and construction plans and look forward to working with local builders and contractors when we are ready to construct our facility.
 Renderings of our exterior and interior are provided on the following slides.
 Next slide, please.
 Perfect.
 So this is the proposed exterior of the dispensary.
 As you can see, we, you know, are renovating the entire site and really beautifying the exterior of the building.
 Next slide.
 The proposed interior rendering is where we create a welcoming, bright, and safe environment for our guests.
 Next slide.
 So now we're going to talk about a very interesting partnership we have here with the arts community in Medford.
 A core value of ours, and one of the primary reasons of our success to date, is our steadfast commitment to contributing in meaningful ways to the communities that we operate in.
 In Medford, we are extremely excited and fortunate to be proposing a variety of ways in which we will expect to benefit the community.
 First and foremost, we have established a tremendous partnership with the arts community in Medford.
 For the last six months, we have had discussions with local leaders in the arts community and learned that despite good efforts and intentions, the arts community in Medford has never been able to find a home.
 That will all change with Theory Medford.
 We have committed to donating 10,000 square feet of our building to the Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that will help manage this brand new arts center.
 In addition to providing the space free of charge, Theory will completely renovate the space to the specifications necessary to provide this community benefit.
 This will create studio space, meeting space, office space, and performing space for the arts.
 Our architect has already been working on preliminary floor plans as mentioned on this slide and we couldn't be happier with the partnership and if all goes to plan we would have the community art center up and running in early 2022.
 Next slide.
 Theory understands that diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity are necessary foundational pillars in building a strong team that represents the communities we operate in and facilitates the creation of a value-driven organization.
 Theory also recognizes how the war on drugs disproportionately affected certain communities of color.
 As leaders in the cannabis industry, we have a real responsibility to lead by example, create positive change, and foster opportunities for generational wealth creation for those who have been negatively affected by the unjust historical policies.
 To that end, in 2019 theory launched a first of its kind social equity program, providing $250,000 in no strings attached zero interest financing.
 In addition to resources training and coaching to an economic empowerment applicant who is in the process of launching their own dispensary.
 After interviewing around a dozen qualified applicants, in July of 2019, Theory selected entrepreneurs Vanessa Jean Baptiste and Mark Bouquet of Legal Greens to be the first participants in our program.
 Legal Greens is comprised of these two business partners, both Black, one being a woman, who grew up and reside in neighborhoods that were adversely affected by the war on drugs.
 After nearly two years, in March 2021, Legal Greens opened their recreational dispensary in Brockton, becoming the first Black-owned
 woman-owned recreational dispensary on the East Coast.
 We're very proud of the team at Legal Greens and look forward to replicating this program in Medford if we're fortunate enough to continue on with our project here.
 Additionally, Theory is committed to hiring a diverse workforce in Medford.
 We truly believe that our people is what allows our company to be most successful and that diversity is an asset to any organization.
 proven to foster improved decision-making, increased innovation, stronger customer relationships, and increased employee engagement.
 In Medford, Theory has worked closely with the Mystic branch of the NAACP on a comprehensive diversity hiring plan.
 We are committed to creating a workforce that is at least 50% women, 35% diverse, and 5% veteran, with this goal extending through all management positions.
 Theory offers terrific advancement opportunities and goes through great lengths in our recruitment process to ensure we are hiring without bias or discrimination.
 Next slide, please.
 A major driver of our positive impact in Medford will be economic.
 First, we plan on hiring over 60 well-paid full-time individuals with a mandate that the workforce is diverse and local.
 Specifically, at least 75% of our employees will be Medford residents.
 All team members are provided comprehensive benefits, which include a 401k plan.
 We're especially proud to offer this 401k plan, which right now is not very common in the cannabis industry due to the challenges in working with finding a provider for a program like that.
 As the number one retailer in Massachusetts, we are confident in our projections that each year our Medford dispensary will provide the city with over $2 million in direct cash contributions through both tax revenue and our community host agreement.
 In addition to the commitments to donate to the arts community, Theory has also allocated $50,000 per year to support local nonprofits.
 This is consistent with our track record as we have already support dozens of nonprofits throughout the state.
 Next slide, please.
 We acknowledge and appreciate that one of the possible negative impacts from an adult use dispensary is localized traffic condition.
 In order to meet the economic development goals of the city while simultaneously avoiding any traffic congestion problems, an operator must carefully choose a location that is suitable to handle a high volume of customers.
 There are very few properties within the permitted zones in Medford that provide easy access, have sufficient parking, contain good interior space, and would not materially impact localized traffic.
 This is something that we took very seriously and we're well qualified to analyze having years of experience citing and operating high traffic retail dispensers.
 After looking at dozens of options in Medford for our proposed site, we committed to 162 Mystic Avenue based on a number of factors, including and importantly, the site's ability to serve our projected number of customer visits per day from an access parking and favorable traffic impact perspective.
 Our location is a former car dealership located two minutes off 93 with 59 parking stalls, significantly more than what our projected daily customer visits would demand as further detailed below.
 By comparison, in Great Barrington and Chicopee, where we also operate recreational dispensaries, our location served between 600 and over 1,000 customers per day on busy days with less parking capacity and have had zero material traffic issues to date.
 To demonstrate the suitability of our proposed location, Theory engaged a professional traffic engineering and analysis firm to perform a comprehensive traffic study.
 This 27-page traffic study concluded that our operation of a marijuana retailer at 162 Mystic Avenue would not negatively impact traffic on Mystic Ave.
 Furthermore, as we have done at our other locations, we will work closely with the Medford Police Department to ensure we have a comprehensive traffic control plan in place, including police details as necessary for the initial opening period.
 Next slide, please.
 Our track record and experience showcase that our operational plans and staff training will lead to the safe operations of a marijuana retailer in Medford, including ensuring that diversion and underage sales do not take place at our location.
 We have served over 1 million customers in Massachusetts without any underage sales.
 We check identification three times, once at the door, once in the reception room, and again at the sales counter.
 Furthermore, we use a machine called ID Science that scans each identification for validity.
 This equipment is also used in casinos and updates itself every 30 days with a
 comprehensive database of all valid forms of state ID across the country, as well as all passports in the world.
 By using this machine, we have caught hundreds of expired or invalid forms of identification at our other locations.
 All of our products are secured in the vault, which has extensive security features.
 We are also constantly monitoring our parking areas and have a zero tolerance policy for consumption of cannabis on site.
 Any customers that are found to be consuming on site would be permanently banned from returning to our location.
 Next slide, please.
 An important aspect to discuss is the safety and security that will be designed and implemented at our dispensary.
 It is first helpful to acknowledge and appreciate that Theory has served over a million customers with an excellent safety and security track record.
 And in our other communities, we maintain direct lines of communication with our local law enforcement partners, whom have written letters of recommendation, calling Theory a model for others to follow.
 Our comprehensive safety and security plan would first be reviewed with the Medford Police Department prior to being finalized.
 We always look forward to receiving feedback and improving our plan based on conversations with law enforcement professionals.
 At all times during operational hours, Theory has a highly trained safety and security team that works both inside and outside the dispensary.
 They are there to ensure that no prohibited activities take place on our premise.
 In large part due to our terrific safety and security team, we have not had any nuisance complaints about unsavory customer activity from any of our neighbors at our existing locations.
 Moreover, the dispensary will be outfitted with an extensive alarm and video monitoring system using the most modern technology available.
 This technology is a cornerstone of our safety and security plan and allows us to offer both a welcoming and safe environment for our guests and our neighbors.
 Next slide, please.
 Theory is committed to leading the cannabis industry by taking meaningful measures towards achieving a more sustainable future, despite the level of short-term investment it may require.
 Sustainability is a fundamental value at Theory, woven into our decision-making on a daily basis.
 To date, we have invested millions in energy-reductive technology, effectively offsetting over 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year by moving 90% of our cannabis cultivation operations outdoors, and have greened the majority of our energy usage by purchasing over 85% of our energy from renewable sources.
 Our plan for Medford will push our sustainability actions even further.
 We have a 79-point sustainability action plan consisting of bold measures, including the installation of 263 solar panels on our roof, pledging to electrify our vehicles, obtaining 100% of our company-wide energy needs from renewables, purchasing carbon offsets, sourcing from and supporting local businesses, installing electric vehicle charging stations, incentivizing public transportation,
 using sustainable design and building materials, and sponsoring green entrepreneurship in the city of Medford.
 To hold ourselves accountable, we will establish a director of sustainability and engage with third party consultants to audit our dispensary on a periodic basis.
 Theory admires and respects the City of Medford's ambitious goals relating to sustainability and energy efficiency and believes our operation will align with and contribute meaningfully towards a shared mission.
 We look forward to being a corporate steward and a contributing member of the Medford community.
 Next slide, please.
 Over the years, Thierry has spent extensive time in the Medford community to understand the concerns and desires of Medford residents and businesses relating to the siting and operation of a marijuana retailer.
 Thierry undertook an independent survey of over 250 Medford residents and incorporated their feedback into our proposal, ensuring that our location, our charitable initiatives, and our hiring plans serve the community best.
 Additionally, we have forged a remarkable relationship with local arts community to design, construct, and provide free ongoing use of a 10,000 square foot community center for the arts, a landmark partnership of historic value.
 Thierry has spoken extensively with hundreds of abutters, local businesses, local leaders, and residents, and received tremendous support, evidenced by the over 60 local letters of support that we've received from a variety of locations as shown in the map on this slide.
 To ensure our local relationship only continues to strengthen, Thierry will be hiring a full-time director of community relations whose primary responsibility is fostering and strengthening the quality of our relationship with the community.
 This individual will be based in Medford and will serve as the day-to-day face of Thierry and a conduit for our community relations.
 This is beyond attending and participating in meetings and community events relating to our business.
 They'll also be managing our charitable budget for local nonprofits.
 Next slide, please.
 So to sum it up, I am confident that Theory is the most qualified applicant to operate in Medford for a couple of reasons.
 First, we have the experience necessary to ensure our dispensary in Medford will be world-class.
 We have an industry-leading track record of success and safety at our other operations in Great Barrington, Chicopee, and Bridgewater.
 We have served over 1 million guests without incident, while maintaining a 99 percentile customer rating.
 We have become a model company to our regulators, our host communities, and our customers.
 We have demonstrated that we know exactly how to operate a world-class cannabis dispensary.
 Second, we have an ambitious, progressive, and well-thought-out plan for positive community impacts here in Medford.
 We have created an incredible partnership with the arts community to construct and donate a brand new 10,000 square feet center for the arts, a first-of-its-kind program for the city.
 Moreover, we will be providing over 60 well-paying jobs with full benefits in 401k, supporting local businesses and non-profits, financing local entrepreneurs and social equity applicants, and contributing to the sustainability and diversity goals of the City.
 From a pure economic perspective, we will contribute over $2 million per year to the city in direct payments, amounts we have shown to provide to our other communities.
 Third, after years of scouting, we have carefully chosen a location that we believe makes an ideal site for a dispensary from an infrastructure, traffic, and security standpoint.
 Moreover, our location reflects the desires and priorities of the local community.
 Our location at 162 Mystic Avenue is discreet, has tremendous parking, is located in a C2 district away from residential, and will be completely revitalized through our site beautification plan.
 Having been on the forefront of the industry for years, I appreciate the challenges and unknowns that this new type of business can present.
 With our comprehensive plan for positive impact, industry-leading reputation, and operating experience, I know theory would be the premier choice for the City of Medford.
 I want to thank you all for your attention so far, and now I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan for the question and answer portion of the meeting.
 Thank you, and next slide.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=1956.145s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谢谢你，布兰登。
 嗯，提醒一下，根据当地规划法和州要求，包括马萨诸塞州普通法第94G章和CCC规定，这次会议是公开的，并且正在记录。
 我只是想向大家通报会议指南的最新情况。
 我现在将开始会议的公众评论和问答部分。
 我将首先阅读我们从居民那里收到的问题和评论。
 因此，我将确认已经在问答部分提出的问题。
 最后，我们将开放一般性问题和答案。

 所以让我继续前进并停下来。我想我们提前有八个问题和评论。
 我将按照它们出现的顺序阅读它们。
 我会让布兰登或任何人成为这个主题的专家
 有机会回答，然后我们将继续讨论下一节中的下一个问题。
 这是从五月开始的。
 梅，我很抱歉念错了你的姓氏，但我认为是马克·布里克。
 作为梅德福市 30 多年的艺术倡导者以及梅德福 CATCH、C-A-T-H-E 的创始人，她在《亲爱的理论健康》中写道：
 我亲身体会到，对于艺术界来说，拥有一个可以举行会议、向公众免费或最低费用提供节目以及为艺术家、工作室等提供空间的场所是多么重要。
 在过去的十年里，人们对艺术和文化的兴趣大大增加，因此拥有一个社区中心将提高我们应对这一趋势的能力。
 过去五年，与艺术相关的节目减少活动从 605 场增加到
 增加至 1,000 多个，增加了 65%。
 在神秘大道上提供 10,000 平方英尺的空间将是我们需求和梦想的答案。
 我们城市附近的每个城镇都有一个艺术社区中心，因此我们竭诚支持您向梅德福市提出建立成人用途转售业务的申请，其中包括为非营利组织梅德福艺术合作组织提供社区艺术中心的空间。
 我代表社会上众多与艺术相关的组织感谢您为支持艺术所做的贡献。
 布兰登，毫无疑问，我会给你机会对五月份发送的内容发表评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2139.428s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 当然。
 谢谢你，乔纳森。
 我只想说谢谢你，梅，你的好话，我们很高兴能与你和艺术界在这个项目上合作。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2149.717s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 出色的。
 好吧，下一个问题来自帕姆·尚利。
 这里有几个问题，所以我将阅读一般性陈述，然后逐一研究每个问题。
 您好，感谢您在这里做这件事，并感谢 Pam 提出的一些问题，Pam 是梅德福 Catch Arts Group 的成员，也是梅德福的居民。
 首先，与药房和梅德福艺术集团之间的潜在关系是什么？
 布兰登，如果你想总结一下这种关系，我知道它已经被涵盖了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2185.371s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，我们本质上将充当房东，免费提供空间，并根据艺术合作组织提出的规范建造艺术中心。
 除了作为房东向社区提供免费租金外，我们没有任何运营控制权或参与权。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2211.02s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 出色的。
 下一个问题是：他们可以自由租用艺术课、表演和聚会的空间吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2218.666s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，绝对是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2222.269s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谁来管理梅德福艺术集团，或者他们可以自由地在限制范围内做任何事情？
 这些潜在的限制是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2231.896s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 因此，从我们的角度来看，我不能对艺术合作社的管理说太多。
 我的意思是，这是一个运营良好的非营利组织，有各种各样的人在那里工作。
 从我的角度来看，他们可以自由地使用他们认为对社区最有利的空间。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2257.742s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 下一个问题很短。
 可以使用 Wi-Fi 吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2261.113s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 哦，是的，绝对是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2263.555s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 好的，一切都很好。
 最后两个。
 艺术、梅德福艺术团体什么时候可以进入这座建筑？
 呃，那是24点7分吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2275.425s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的。
 是的。
 这是一个与药房完全分开的空间，他们可以完全控制他们希望人们访问该空间的频率。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2285.853s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 出色的。
 最后一个问题是关于停车的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2289.263s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，他们将在艺术中心前面停放传统停车位和 ADA 无障碍停车位。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2296.666s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 太好了，感谢布兰登并感谢帕姆提交您的问题。
 我也会在会议上见到你，所以我很高兴我们有机会回答你的问题。
 嗯，第三个问题是辛迪·沃森（Cindy Watson）提出的。
 许多研究表明艺术可以救命，但反过来也可以致命。
 容纳艺术的空间。
 去年八月，拜登总统宣称，我们的未来在于艺术。
 它是我们灵魂的表达。
 这一深刻的声明是对需要从联邦预算中拨款资助艺术和文化的警告。
 我会仔细阅读这篇文章，但只是为了记录，为了问题和答案，为了
 为了有机会发言，我将尝试更多地谈论幸福理论及其对社区的参与这一话题。
 不过，我很感谢这里提出的评论以及我们收到的这条消息。
 因此，这一意义深远的声明是对需要从联邦预算中拨款资助艺术和文化的警告。
 目前，美国在资助艺术方面远远落后于欧洲同行。
 他夸大了这种需要。
 来自世界各地的艺术家支持这一想法并表达了这一感人的信息。
 在过去的 15 个月里，我所知道的是，要突出最黑暗的事物，创造快乐，抓住每一个机会做好事，每天在艺术家的作品中看到美丽，他们相信这将帮助我们重新找到自己。
 这对我有帮助，也许对你也有帮助。
 我相信当海洋无法容纳我们的痛苦时，艺术将帮助我们应对损失。
 非常好的报价。
 城市福利局与艺术界合作提供急需的空间的努力值得赞扬。
 他们认识到捍卫我们事业的必要性。
 我希望这种伙伴关系能够取得成果。
 毫无疑问，它会让每个人脸上露出笑容，因为它确实是通用语言。
 所以谢谢你辛迪。
 我也会为布兰登提供回应这一问题的机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2432.47s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，重复一遍，乔纳森。
 谢谢。
 谢谢你辛迪。
 我们感谢您的善意之言，也期待着合作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2443.914s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 好吧，下一个问题来自罗伯特·加西亚。
 气球老板，不知道是品牌还是，见谅。
 但谁在乎呢，Theory Wellness 是马萨诸塞州最赚钱的大麻公司之一。
 他们已在布里奇沃特、奇科皮和大巴灵顿开展业务四年多了。
 他将成为梅德福和美国纳税人最好的大麻金融合作伙伴。
 据我了解，他们必须付费才能看到3%的毛利润。
 没有其他候选人可以接近他们。
 所以我们可以。
 毫无疑问。
 但我会再次为布兰登提供回应的机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2481.071s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，谢谢你，乔纳森。
 我想是的，我认为他拥有一家当地企业。
 需要澄清的是，从经济角度来看，我们实际上将分享收入的 6%，而不是利润，因此向市政府提供更多资金，这应该有助于减轻其他纳税人的负担，其他一切都会得到解决。
 所以我们当然希望以这种方式帮助社区。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2506.076s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 出色的。
 嗯，这是西尔维娅·加西亚发来的。
 我，西尔维娅·加西亚，支持
 健康理论和您的应用程序在神秘应用程序上命名大麻药房，因为我看到了您的计划并且该建筑看起来很漂亮。
 我特别喜欢大麻业务位于建筑物的后面，远离街道，远离所有人的视线，而建筑物的前面将有一个单独的非大麻用途。
 所以，这来自
 西尔维娅住在梅德福。
 我不会公布他的地址，但他以居民身份登录，我们对此表示赞赏。
 布兰登，我将再次为您提供回应的机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2547.392s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 不，我们感谢您的评论，西尔维娅。
 感谢您的支持。
 我们当然同意，正如您提到的，当我们今年早些时候对梅德福居民进行广泛调查时，我们清楚地听到人们希望成年人吸食大麻，但他们希望在一个隐蔽的地方吸食大麻，而我们在这里提供了绝佳的机会。
 所以谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2570.233s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谢谢你，布兰登。
 这是来自
 另一位梅德福居民梅丽莎·米格尔（Melissa Miguel），我不想重读整个演讲。
 她写信给市政府官员：我今天写信是为了表达我对福利理论和南梅德福神秘大道拟议地点的支持。
 作为南梅德福的长期居民，我很高兴看到负责任的社区合作伙伴和负责任的社区合作伙伴有兴趣在我们的社区开展业务。
 他们在马萨诸塞州拥有悠久的大麻历史，并且非常重视安全。
 他们对您的财产提供24小时监控，并确保周边地区私人财产的隐私不被侵犯。
 梅德福在吸引企业到南梅德福地区方面做得很差，我希望随着神秘大道乳制品健康中心的批准，这种情况会有所改变。
 布兰登，我将再次为您提供发表评论的机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2629.179s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，不，我们感谢您的支持，梅丽莎。
 我们当然相信并同意您的看法，我们在 162 Mystic Ave 的存在将提高该社区的整体安全性，并为其他将在我们这里购物的当地企业提供新客户。
 这些客户肯定也会拜访我们的邻居。
 这就是为什么我们认为这对南梅德福商业界有利。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2659.97s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 明亮的。
 下一个问题来自乔纳森·费根。
 他说，你好。
 我的名字是乔纳森·费根。
 我是 CATCH 的董事会成员，也是梅德福爵士音乐节的创始人。
 我想在今天的会议之前重申我对 Siri Wellness 申请的支持，特别是考虑到他们提议为社区提供 10,000 平方英尺的艺术空间，这是一个支持付费表演和视觉艺术的新空间。
 在振兴整个艺术界方面发挥着巨大作用，特别是考虑到近几个月关闭的空间数量。
 神秘大道店面将提供急需的知名度，特别是对于想要向更广泛的社区展示其作品的画家和其他艺术家而言。
 让我随时了解会议情况、会议进展情况，并让我知道我还能做些什么来更好地帮助约翰逊。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2712.832s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，不用了，谢谢，乔纳森。
 我们感谢您的善意和支持，并当然希望有机会为艺术提供空间。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2728.183s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 出色的。
 好吧，最后一个问题来自 Jéssica Rubitico。
 Sorry if I mispronounced the last name there.
 我很高兴支持神秘大道的感觉良好理论。
 他们不遗余力地将梅德福艺术带到了他们的神秘大道网站。
 梅德福的艺术从来没有一个家，现在是时候了。
 Thank you Siri, we love you.
 This is from Jessica and she lives in Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2759.583s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，谢谢你，杰西卡。
 我们非常感谢您的支持，如果我们能够继续推进该项目并使艺术中心正常运行，我们将感到非常高兴和幸运。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2771.817s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 太好了，谢谢布兰登。
 前面提出的问题到此结束。
 我现在将进入问答部分。
 我只是想郑重声明一下，现在有 18 个人出席会议。
 这是布伦达·布里发来的。
 您与哪个梅德福艺术组织合作？
 我想我们会再次澄清这个问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2793.761s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，该组织称为艺术合作组织。
 这是一个新成立的非营利组织
 我知道这是梅德福现有的几个艺术团体之间的合作，他们聚集在一起，帮助我们为艺术社区设计空间，所以他们将是技术上免费转租理论空间的人。
 So Arts Collaborative 是我们合作的艺术组织的名称。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2825.547s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谢谢你，布兰登。
 下一个问题...好吧，太好了。
 抱歉，这是一个新领域。
 丹尼·莱昂问道：布兰登能否澄清他对 Temescal Wellness 的所有权？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2847.619s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，我认为……我参与了新罕布什尔州一家名为 Temescal Wellness 的非营利组织的公司。
 很多很多年前。
 我不拥有、参与、控制或了解与马萨诸塞州“10 分钟健康”相关的任何事情。
 所以不，那里没有财产。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2870.754s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谢谢你，布兰登。
 另一位来自 Dan Leon 的人，您能解释一下 Theory Farms 的所有权吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2881.58s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 所以 Theory Farms，这是我自己和 Theory 的其他一些创始人共同发起的一个项目这一切都始于几年前，当时他获得了临时执照。
 我们从未继续推进该项目，实际上还取消了该许可证。
 因此，我不知道 Theory Farms 目前的所有权，尽管我相信一旦他们获得许可证，他们就会将名称更改为另一个名称。
 但我们目前对理论农场不感兴趣。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2913.761s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谢谢布伦丹。
 最后一个问题和答案来自 Brenda Breath。
 药房和艺术空间的停车位如何划分？
 会为每个人保留一些空间吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2925.963s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，我认为当我们通过艺术合作最终确定我们的位置计划和开发计划时，我们将能够更多地讨论我们想要如何管理停车。
 嗯，我认为一般来说，我们希望确保为嗯，合作艺术预留停车位，嗯，只要他们需要，你知道，就在空间前面。
 然后，如果他们确实举办了更大的活动，我认为我们希望与我们的药房管理团队建立合作关系，以确保我们准备好处理这一问题。
 对于较大的活动，如果它可能影响我们自己的运营，我们当然可以利用现场的停车位来处理，并且您知道，如果有必要，我们可以使用杠杆，例如让我们的员工在街对面停车一天左右。
 但现场有 59 个停车位，我非常有信心我们不会出现任何停车问题，而且我们将做好充分准备，确保每个人都能快速、轻松地找到停车位。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2981.528s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 出色的。
 谢谢你，布兰登。
 在 Zoom 聊天的问答部分不再看到问题，我将继续讨论那些举手的问题。
 所以我要去寻找肯·克劳斯。
 肯，如果您愿意，我们将允许您打开麦克风和视频。
 所以肯.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3002.521s">[Ken Krause]</a>: 你能听到我吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3003.862s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3004.522s">[Ken Krause]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 是的，肯·克劳斯。
 梅德福居民 21 年。
 在此期间，我特别参与了艺术和环境组织。
 我对艺术中心的前景感到非常兴奋，这是艺术界人士近 15 年来不断努力的成果。
 梅德福艺术合作组织
 在里面呆了好几年，看了一些地方。
 这非常令人兴奋。
 我也对酒店对可持续发展的重视感到满意。
 所以我有两个问题。
 第一个，
 可能是最短的答案。
 关于该物业的建设，我在所提供的简短图像中没有看到任何树木。
 总体而言，神秘大道沿线严重缺乏树木，我想知道您是否制定了景观美化计划，以了解是否有潜力，或者您是否计划在该房产中添加树木。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3066.07s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，谢谢，肯。
 这是布兰登。
 我可以回答这个问题。
 首先，感谢您对艺术方面的支持和尊重。
 尼克和我，Theory 的创始人，非常关心可持续发展，也很欣赏关于树木覆盖的评论。
 我们的景观美化计划尚未最终确定，所以我当然可以考虑这一点。
 我想我们当然想添加
 将其添加到景观中。
 你知道，有一些警告。
 从安全角度来看，我们不想阻挡我们的摄像头或类似的东西，但站点的某些区域肯定可以使用一些树木覆盖来增加一些阴影。
 所以我认为这是一个很好的观点。
 好消息是我们还没有最终确定景观美化计划。
 所以我们当然可以考虑到这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3109.836s">[Ken Krause]</a>: 好吧，谢谢。
 我的第二个问题是，我一直在与康复社区的人们交谈，他们非常有兴趣能够轻松地支持艺术中心并参加那里的活动，也许在那里有一个工作室。
 他们的担忧与他们能够舒适地生活的信心有关
 访问一个离药房很近的地方，就在它后面。
 你提到了一些关于空间完全独立的事情，我认为这很重要，还有现场严格的无消费政策。
 我想知道您是否可以多谈谈连续空间的设置以及是否有共享空间？
 是否有单独的条目？
 还有其他细节可以帮助我们了解这两个实体如何单独合作吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3183.104s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，不用了，谢谢，肯。
 这是一个非常好的问题。
 需要回应的一些要点。
 首先，它们是完全不同的空间，实际上在它们之间可能会有一个空的存储区域，你知道，但绝对无法从一个空间访问另一个空间。
 入口也完全独立。
 此外，我们目前经营药房，随着时间的推移，我们真正学会了如何确保我们的
 该业务运作非常谨慎，就像一家零售店，因此外行甚至可能不知道我们在做什么，除非他们来找我们购买大麻。
 例如，商店不会散发气味，因为所有产品在到达该地点之前都是密封且预先包装的。
 你知道，我们没有大罐的样品和大麻之类的东西。
 从这个意义上说，他非常专业和谨慎。
 这也适用于我们的场地规划。
 所以我们的建筑外观肯定会美化这个地方，但我们不会把我们所做的事情做得很浮华。
 那里没有大麻叶。
 没有闪烁的霓虹灯。
 他非常专业而且谨慎。
 我绝对理解这些担忧，而且它们当然是非常合理的。
 最重要的是，当我们与艺术合作组织合作时，
 如果出现问题，我们将快速讨论如何解决它们并改善任何问题或摩擦点，以确保每个人都能从合作伙伴关系中获得最大收益。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3286.031s">[Ken Krause]</a>: 非常感谢。
 祝你好运。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3288.373s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3293.357s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 一切都好。
 我会确保五月到来。
 这位马克·布雷克，请再次原谅我搞砸了发音。
 你好梅格。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3307.686s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: 取消静音。
 是的，我只是想非常感谢您今天做这个演讲。
 这是非常有用的。
 我的问题是：我不确定：大麻植物将在哪里种植？
 是在现场还是异地？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3331.624s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，这是个好问题，梅。
 谢谢你提出这个问题。
 因此，我们是一家垂直整合的公司，这使我们能够从种植自己的大麻植物中受益。
 因此，我们在马萨诸塞州梅德福以外的两个地点进行此操作。
 因此，梅德福不会种植大麻。
 我们在室内长大。
 因此，我们在布里奇沃特有室内农场，在伯克郡的谢菲尔德有一个室外大麻农场。
 然后这些产品被干燥、测试、包装，然后运输到药房出售，但现场没有工厂。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3373.481s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: 谢谢你，布兰登。
 我只想说，对于梅德福和艺术界来说，最终拥有一个家是多么重要。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3385.426s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 谢谢。
 我们很期待。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3395.974s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 我只是要把你的手放下。
 如果您还有其他问题，请随时再次询问。
 下一个问题或我看到的下一手牌是 Laurel S。所以我会让你退出激活模式。
 所以劳雷尔。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3409.425s">[Laurel Siegel]</a>: 你好。
 我是劳雷尔·西格尔，现任梅德福艺术合作组织主席。
 我也是 CACHE 的主席，如果可以的话，我只是想和艺术合作组织聊一会儿。
 因此，我们由 CACHE、梅德福艺术委员会和梅德福艺术学院的成员以及艺术界的其他利益相关者组成。
 这就是为什么我们从梅德福艺术界带来了大量的经验和知识。
 我主要想说的是：我想借此机会感谢 Theory 提供的这个机会。
 我认为这对梅德福艺术界来说是一个巨大的机会。
 我感谢您向我们提交的提案的慷慨和专业精神。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3458.059s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 谢谢劳雷尔。
 我们感谢您的支持，并当然期待继续与您和艺术合作团队的其他成员合作。
 所以再次感谢。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3470.322s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谢谢劳雷尔。
 抱歉，我只是纠正中心。
 然后肯还有另一个问题。
 我会让肯回来的。
 已知？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3493.12s">[Ken Krause]</a>: 谢谢。
 是的，我又想到了一个问题。
 我没有看你提到的交通研究。
 这考虑了进出现场的卡车流量，包括送货和其他可能发生的事情。
 您是否会乘坐交通工具往返该地点，还是完全亲自进行操作？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3521.245s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的当然。
 好，绝对是好问题，肯。
 就像提醒我们的观众一样，总的来说，我们已经，或者很抱歉，我不得不说，梅德福市已在该市的网站上公布了梅德福药房所有申请人的完整申请，其中包括我们的交通计划副本。
 但本质上，
 关于交通的答案是，我们只会有一辆送货车辆，每周前往梅德福几次。
 因此，这不会对交通造成实质性影响。
 这些是福特全顺货车。
 它们不是 18 轮车。
 我希望我们有那么忙，但我们没那么忙。
 它们只是每周运输一到两次大麻的运输车。
 没有从梅德福发货。
 因此，仅进行传入交货。
 谨慎地，不在工作时间，在一天中的任意时间。
 因此，每周仅运送几辆货车不会对交通产生重大影响。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3588.006s">[Ken Krause]</a>: 好的，谢谢。
 我尝试下载该应用程序，但它大约有 108 MB。
 这就是为什么它非常累人。
 对于我的小电脑来说，这实在是太难处理了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3600.131s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 是的，不，它相当广泛。
 但我们对我们的提议进行了很多思考。
 我认为这当然是考虑请求长度的一种方法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3612.856s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谢谢肯。
 我只是要清除参与者链接。
 好吧，我在问答中没有更多问题，也没有看到更多举手。
 来得正是时候，丹尼。
 Danny Leone，您是多州 MSO 运营商吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3635.709s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 因此，我们的品牌 Theory Wellness 也在缅因州运营。
 然而，在 Theory Wellness Incorporated 的这项提案中，我们是一家总部位于马萨诸塞州的公司，且仅位于马萨诸塞州。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3655.418s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 好的，太好了。
 这是直播。
 嗯，我也在看问答部分。
 我还在查看参与者链，看看是否有人举手。
 我目前没有看到任何。
 我想我们会做最后一次通话。
 如果出现任何问题，还可以提供联系信息。
 你知道，想什么。
 我知道他们已经发布了一封电子邮件来联系他们，我相信他们会很乐意接受今晚会议后出现的任何对话。
 那么，想要聊天或想要加入聊天的人还有什么问题吗？
 谢谢。
 我从肯那里得到了一份。
 肯·克劳斯问道：您能告诉我们选择过程的下一步是什么吗？
 我想这是为了梅德福，而不是为了州政府。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3713.547s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 当然，梅德福有一个大麻咨询委员会，由梅德福市的不同官员组成。
 他们目前正在评估提案，基本上将选择三名候选人向市长办公室推荐，以达成所谓的东道社区协议，这是该过程的下一步。
 我们的理解是，到目前为止所讨论的是，这些建议将在八月底之前完成，然后市长可能会立即与东道社区达成协议。
 如果我们有幸被选中，我们可以申请州许可证，向 ZBA 申请特殊许可证，并准备开始药房和艺术中心的建设。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3772.758s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: 谢谢你，布兰登。
 好吧，我将继续进行最后一次通话。
 肯在问答中写道。
 谢谢。
 因此，如果有人还有任何其他问题，我将保留最后一次通话大约一分钟。
 但我想现在我们只想对所有倾听、参与、发表评论或提出问题的人表示感谢。
 这是一种建设性的社区对话
 维护和维持社区性格的力量非常重要。
 感谢所有花时间加入我们的人。
 如果您还有任何其他问题，请随时通过主屏幕上的电子邮件地址与候选人联系。
 这是一个 emorywellness.org 社区。
 我想再检查一下问答链接和参与者链接，看看是否有任何我在这里没有看到的最终问题。
 再次感谢，布兰登。
 如果你想关闭的话我会把它转给你。
 拥有最后的发言权。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3832.568s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: 当然不是，谢谢乔纳森。
 感谢大家对本次会议的关注和出席。
 我们期待有机会成为这里梅德福社区的成员。
 我们致力于经营一家真正世界一流的药房，以多种重要方式造福社区。
 正如乔纳森提到的，如果您有任何想法，请随时与我们联系。
 我们当然实行开放政策，并渴望与人们讨论和讨论人们对我们的提案提出的任何问题。
 在此，祝大家度过一个美好的夜晚，并再次感谢你们的光临。</p>
