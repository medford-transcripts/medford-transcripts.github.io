 Finalman,
 Wòl mwen nan reyinyon aswè a se moderatè paske CCC mande pou nenpòt moun ki enplike oswa ki gen yon enterè dirèk nan yon lisans pa kapab sèvi kòm moderatè.
 Se la kote konpayi nou an antre.

 Oke, gwo.
 Anvan nou kòmanse prezantasyon nou an, nou ta renmen ba ou kèk enfòmasyon sou rezon ki fè nou reyini la aswè a.
 An 2016, 57.4% votè Medford yo te sipòte kesyon bilten an pou legalize marigwana lwazi.
 Pwoblèm sa a te resevwa apwobasyon tou nan nivo eta a, epi avèk sipò rezidan Medford, vil la ap devlope règ ak règleman sou fason pou aplike marigwana legal nan Medford san danje epi efikas.
 Ane pase a, Konsèy Vil la te apwouve yon òdonans konplè ki pèmèt jiska twa dispansè marigwana lwazi ouvri nan Medford.
 Sa yo ka lokalize nan zòn C2, kèk ladan yo pwopoze pou loje dispansè, osi byen ke zòn endistriyèl.
 Nan kad Pwosesis Medford la, vil la te etabli yon Komite Konsiltatif Cannabis pou rekòmande pou Biwo Majistra a òganizasyon ak lokal ki pi bon pou opere dispansè marigwana an detay nan vil la.
 Yo pral voye rekòmandasyon yo nan biwo meri a nan fen sezon ete.
 Kounye a nou kòmanse prezantasyon Thierry Wilms.
 Mwen pral remèt prezantasyon an bay PDG Thierry Brandon Pollock.
 Brandon, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=601.659s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>:  Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome everyone to our community outreach meeting.
 It is a privilege to be able to discuss our plans with you all this evening, and I very much look forward to the chance to answer your questions and respond to your comments later on in the meeting.
 As a bit of background, I am one of the founders of Theory Wellness, a local cannabis organization that is headquartered in Stoneham.
 We were founded in 2015 and our mission is to create the highest quality dispensary experience for our local communities, our customers, and our employees.
 We have a long and successful track record of operating compliant, safe, and community-centric dispensaries in the Commonwealth, and now employ approximately 300 talented team members here in Massachusetts, providing living wages and a comprehensive benefit package, including a 401k plan.
 We are well known as one of the most respected cannabis organizations in the state, routinely meeting with a variety of cannabis industry stakeholders and regulators to help improve how legal cannabis works here in Massachusetts.
 We take our responsibility to operate as industry leaders very seriously and would be honored to bring our world-class operations to Medford.
 Our first dispensary is a medical only facility that we opened in Bridgewater in 2017.
 We have since then grown to operate two other dispensaries in Massachusetts, one in Chicopee and one in Great Barrington, both of which serve medical patients and adult use customers.
 The Great Barrington location was one of the first recreational stores to open in the state, and that was in January of 2019.
 So this has given us over two years of experience, which is very helpful here in Medford, on how to operate these businesses successfully.
 Thierry also operates indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities and manufactures a wide variety of products.
 In sum, we operate 10 different cannabis licenses here in Massachusetts, which is equal or more to any operational experience of any other business in the state.
 Having at this point served over 1 million different customers in Massachusetts, we look forward to bringing our extensive experience and track record to our South Medford neighborhood.
 Next slide, please.
 After that as well, please.
 So community is very important for us at Theory.
 And that's one of the unique aspects on how we run our business is our approach to community relations.
 We believe the relationship begins by being good listeners, understanding the concerns and desires from all the stakeholders in the community.
 From day one, Theory has listened to and worked closely with our communities to develop positive working relationships that extend from government officials to local businesses, to grassroots organizations, and most importantly, local residents.
 Theory was one of the first cannabis companies in the state to develop a host community agreement, working with the town of Bridgewater since 2016 to share a portion of our revenue with the town to support their municipal programming.
 Since then, Theory has contributed over $8 million in direct financial contributions to our host communities.
 Beyond hiring locally and providing significant economic stimulus, we have focused on building long-term collaborative relationships with municipal governments, as well as local community organizations.
 We have launched an educational series on cannabis, sponsored numerous charitable events, hosted food and clothing drives, and supported over 20 nonprofits in our local communities.
 We look forward to continue on this path with our new project here in Medford.
 Next slide, please.
 So this slide is an overview of our site plan.
 We're proposing a marijuana retailer to be located at 162 Mystic Avenue.
 The site is currently vacant and was previously used as a car dealership.
 Our proposal is to completely renovate and beautify not just the building, but the entire site.
 We searched for over a year to find the perfect location for a dispensary and are extremely happy to be proposing a location at 162 Mystic Ave for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed throughout the presentation.
 These reasons include first and foremost parking.
 This site includes 59 parking stalls with the site plan that you're looking at right now, which is critical to ensure that no traffic issues arise and that we have no nuisance to our neighborhood.
 Number two, the details of the site are pretty unique.
 As shown in the site plan, we have selected a building that has enough space to not just house a dispensary, but also donate 10,000 square feet of space to the arts community, which we will look forward to providing more information on in the upcoming slides.
 Another key benefit of this proposal is that we are able to develop the dispensary in the rear of the building, ensuring that the dispensary is discreetly featured on Mystic Avenue and not front and center.
 Earlier this year, we commissioned a poll of over 250 Medford residents, and it was clear that the majority of residents preferred a dispensary to be discreetly cited like this proposal and not prominently on a main road.
 Next slide, please.
 In respect to zoning compliance, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, Medford has a zoning ordinance that designates the C2 and industrial zones as the two areas in the city where an adult-use dispensary can operate.
 This use is subject to obtaining a special permit from the Zoning Board of Affairs, and there are not regulations from the local health board pertaining to dispensaries.
 That being said, theory has proposed a comprehensive plan to monitor local health impacts and looks forward to working with the Medford Health Department to safely operate our business.
 Our site at 162 Mystic Ave is in the C2 district and is in full compliance with the city's zoning ordinance.
 Importantly, we are over 500 feet away from any K through 12 schools, as shown as a diagram here.
 We have already fully designed our site and construction plans and look forward to working with local builders and contractors when we are ready to construct our facility.
 Renderings of our exterior and interior are provided on the following slides.
 Next slide, please.
 Perfect.
 So this is the proposed exterior of the dispensary.
 As you can see, we, you know, are renovating the entire site and really beautifying the exterior of the building.
 Next slide.
 The proposed interior rendering is where we create a welcoming, bright, and safe environment for our guests.
 Next slide.
 So now we're going to talk about a very interesting partnership we have here with the arts community in Medford.
 A core value of ours, and one of the primary reasons of our success to date, is our steadfast commitment to contributing in meaningful ways to the communities that we operate in.
 In Medford, we are extremely excited and fortunate to be proposing a variety of ways in which we will expect to benefit the community.
 First and foremost, we have established a tremendous partnership with the arts community in Medford.
 For the last six months, we have had discussions with local leaders in the arts community and learned that despite good efforts and intentions, the arts community in Medford has never been able to find a home.
 That will all change with Theory Medford.
 We have committed to donating 10,000 square feet of our building to the Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that will help manage this brand new arts center.
 In addition to providing the space free of charge, Theory will completely renovate the space to the specifications necessary to provide this community benefit.
 This will create studio space, meeting space, office space, and performing space for the arts.
 Our architect has already been working on preliminary floor plans as mentioned on this slide and we couldn't be happier with the partnership and if all goes to plan we would have the community art center up and running in early 2022.
 Next slide.
 Theory understands that diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity are necessary foundational pillars in building a strong team that represents the communities we operate in and facilitates the creation of a value-driven organization.
 Theory also recognizes how the war on drugs disproportionately affected certain communities of color.
 As leaders in the cannabis industry, we have a real responsibility to lead by example, create positive change, and foster opportunities for generational wealth creation for those who have been negatively affected by the unjust historical policies.
 To that end, in 2019 theory launched a first of its kind social equity program, providing $250,000 in no strings attached zero interest financing.
 In addition to resources training and coaching to an economic empowerment applicant who is in the process of launching their own dispensary.
 After interviewing around a dozen qualified applicants, in July of 2019, Theory selected entrepreneurs Vanessa Jean Baptiste and Mark Bouquet of Legal Greens to be the first participants in our program.
 Legal Greens is comprised of these two business partners, both Black, one being a woman, who grew up and reside in neighborhoods that were adversely affected by the war on drugs.
 After nearly two years, in March 2021, Legal Greens opened their recreational dispensary in Brockton, becoming the first Black-owned
 woman-owned recreational dispensary on the East Coast.
 We're very proud of the team at Legal Greens and look forward to replicating this program in Medford if we're fortunate enough to continue on with our project here.
 Additionally, Theory is committed to hiring a diverse workforce in Medford.
 We truly believe that our people is what allows our company to be most successful and that diversity is an asset to any organization.
 proven to foster improved decision-making, increased innovation, stronger customer relationships, and increased employee engagement.
 In Medford, Theory has worked closely with the Mystic branch of the NAACP on a comprehensive diversity hiring plan.
 We are committed to creating a workforce that is at least 50% women, 35% diverse, and 5% veteran, with this goal extending through all management positions.
 Theory offers terrific advancement opportunities and goes through great lengths in our recruitment process to ensure we are hiring without bias or discrimination.
 Next slide, please.
 A major driver of our positive impact in Medford will be economic.
 First, we plan on hiring over 60 well-paid full-time individuals with a mandate that the workforce is diverse and local.
 Specifically, at least 75% of our employees will be Medford residents.
 All team members are provided comprehensive benefits, which include a 401k plan.
 We're especially proud to offer this 401k plan, which right now is not very common in the cannabis industry due to the challenges in working with finding a provider for a program like that.
 As the number one retailer in Massachusetts, we are confident in our projections that each year our Medford dispensary will provide the city with over $2 million in direct cash contributions through both tax revenue and our community host agreement.
 In addition to the commitments to donate to the arts community, Theory has also allocated $50,000 per year to support local nonprofits.
 This is consistent with our track record as we have already support dozens of nonprofits throughout the state.
 Next slide, please.
 We acknowledge and appreciate that one of the possible negative impacts from an adult use dispensary is localized traffic condition.
 In order to meet the economic development goals of the city while simultaneously avoiding any traffic congestion problems, an operator must carefully choose a location that is suitable to handle a high volume of customers.
 There are very few properties within the permitted zones in Medford that provide easy access, have sufficient parking, contain good interior space, and would not materially impact localized traffic.
 This is something that we took very seriously and we're well qualified to analyze having years of experience citing and operating high traffic retail dispensers.
 After looking at dozens of options in Medford for our proposed site, we committed to 162 Mystic Avenue based on a number of factors, including and importantly, the site's ability to serve our projected number of customer visits per day from an access parking and favorable traffic impact perspective.
 Our location is a former car dealership located two minutes off 93 with 59 parking stalls, significantly more than what our projected daily customer visits would demand as further detailed below.
 By comparison, in Great Barrington and Chicopee, where we also operate recreational dispensaries, our location served between 600 and over 1,000 customers per day on busy days with less parking capacity and have had zero material traffic issues to date.
 To demonstrate the suitability of our proposed location, Theory engaged a professional traffic engineering and analysis firm to perform a comprehensive traffic study.
 This 27-page traffic study concluded that our operation of a marijuana retailer at 162 Mystic Avenue would not negatively impact traffic on Mystic Ave.
 Furthermore, as we have done at our other locations, we will work closely with the Medford Police Department to ensure we have a comprehensive traffic control plan in place, including police details as necessary for the initial opening period.
 Next slide, please.
 Our track record and experience showcase that our operational plans and staff training will lead to the safe operations of a marijuana retailer in Medford, including ensuring that diversion and underage sales do not take place at our location.
 We have served over 1 million customers in Massachusetts without any underage sales.
 We check identification three times, once at the door, once in the reception room, and again at the sales counter.
 Furthermore, we use a machine called ID Science that scans each identification for validity.
 This equipment is also used in casinos and updates itself every 30 days with a
 comprehensive database of all valid forms of state ID across the country, as well as all passports in the world.
 By using this machine, we have caught hundreds of expired or invalid forms of identification at our other locations.
 All of our products are secured in the vault, which has extensive security features.
 We are also constantly monitoring our parking areas and have a zero tolerance policy for consumption of cannabis on site.
 Any customers that are found to be consuming on site would be permanently banned from returning to our location.
 Next slide, please.
 An important aspect to discuss is the safety and security that will be designed and implemented at our dispensary.
 It is first helpful to acknowledge and appreciate that Theory has served over a million customers with an excellent safety and security track record.
 And in our other communities, we maintain direct lines of communication with our local law enforcement partners, whom have written letters of recommendation, calling Theory a model for others to follow.
 Our comprehensive safety and security plan would first be reviewed with the Medford Police Department prior to being finalized.
 We always look forward to receiving feedback and improving our plan based on conversations with law enforcement professionals.
 At all times during operational hours, Theory has a highly trained safety and security team that works both inside and outside the dispensary.
 They are there to ensure that no prohibited activities take place on our premise.
 In large part due to our terrific safety and security team, we have not had any nuisance complaints about unsavory customer activity from any of our neighbors at our existing locations.
 Moreover, the dispensary will be outfitted with an extensive alarm and video monitoring system using the most modern technology available.
 This technology is a cornerstone of our safety and security plan and allows us to offer both a welcoming and safe environment for our guests and our neighbors.
 Next slide, please.
 Theory is committed to leading the cannabis industry by taking meaningful measures towards achieving a more sustainable future, despite the level of short-term investment it may require.
 Sustainability is a fundamental value at Theory, woven into our decision-making on a daily basis.
 To date, we have invested millions in energy-reductive technology, effectively offsetting over 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year by moving 90% of our cannabis cultivation operations outdoors, and have greened the majority of our energy usage by purchasing over 85% of our energy from renewable sources.
 Our plan for Medford will push our sustainability actions even further.
 We have a 79-point sustainability action plan consisting of bold measures, including the installation of 263 solar panels on our roof, pledging to electrify our vehicles, obtaining 100% of our company-wide energy needs from renewables, purchasing carbon offsets, sourcing from and supporting local businesses, installing electric vehicle charging stations, incentivizing public transportation,
 using sustainable design and building materials, and sponsoring green entrepreneurship in the city of Medford.
 To hold ourselves accountable, we will establish a director of sustainability and engage with third party consultants to audit our dispensary on a periodic basis.
 Theory admires and respects the City of Medford's ambitious goals relating to sustainability and energy efficiency and believes our operation will align with and contribute meaningfully towards a shared mission.
 We look forward to being a corporate steward and a contributing member of the Medford community.
 Next slide, please.
 Over the years, Thierry has spent extensive time in the Medford community to understand the concerns and desires of Medford residents and businesses relating to the siting and operation of a marijuana retailer.
 Thierry undertook an independent survey of over 250 Medford residents and incorporated their feedback into our proposal, ensuring that our location, our charitable initiatives, and our hiring plans serve the community best.
 Additionally, we have forged a remarkable relationship with local arts community to design, construct, and provide free ongoing use of a 10,000 square foot community center for the arts, a landmark partnership of historic value.
 Thierry has spoken extensively with hundreds of abutters, local businesses, local leaders, and residents, and received tremendous support, evidenced by the over 60 local letters of support that we've received from a variety of locations as shown in the map on this slide.
 To ensure our local relationship only continues to strengthen, Thierry will be hiring a full-time director of community relations whose primary responsibility is fostering and strengthening the quality of our relationship with the community.
 This individual will be based in Medford and will serve as the day-to-day face of Thierry and a conduit for our community relations.
 This is beyond attending and participating in meetings and community events relating to our business.
 They'll also be managing our charitable budget for local nonprofits.
 Next slide, please.
 So to sum it up, I am confident that Theory is the most qualified applicant to operate in Medford for a couple of reasons.
 First, we have the experience necessary to ensure our dispensary in Medford will be world-class.
 We have an industry-leading track record of success and safety at our other operations in Great Barrington, Chicopee, and Bridgewater.
 We have served over 1 million guests without incident, while maintaining a 99 percentile customer rating.
 We have become a model company to our regulators, our host communities, and our customers.
 We have demonstrated that we know exactly how to operate a world-class cannabis dispensary.
 Second, we have an ambitious, progressive, and well-thought-out plan for positive community impacts here in Medford.
 We have created an incredible partnership with the arts community to construct and donate a brand new 10,000 square feet center for the arts, a first-of-its-kind program for the city.
 Moreover, we will be providing over 60 well-paying jobs with full benefits in 401k, supporting local businesses and non-profits, financing local entrepreneurs and social equity applicants, and contributing to the sustainability and diversity goals of the City.
 From a pure economic perspective, we will contribute over $2 million per year to the city in direct payments, amounts we have shown to provide to our other communities.
 Third, after years of scouting, we have carefully chosen a location that we believe makes an ideal site for a dispensary from an infrastructure, traffic, and security standpoint.
 Moreover, our location reflects the desires and priorities of the local community.
 Our location at 162 Mystic Avenue is discreet, has tremendous parking, is located in a C2 district away from residential, and will be completely revitalized through our site beautification plan.
 Having been on the forefront of the industry for years, I appreciate the challenges and unknowns that this new type of business can present.
 With our comprehensive plan for positive impact, industry-leading reputation, and operating experience, I know theory would be the premier choice for the City of Medford.
 I want to thank you all for your attention so far, and now I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan for the question and answer portion of the meeting.
 Thank you, and next slide.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=1956.145s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Mèsi, Brandon.
 Oke, kòm yon rapèl, reyinyon sa a se piblik epi yo anrejistre an konfòmite ak lwa planifikasyon lokal yo ak egzijans eta a, ki gen ladan Lwa Jeneral Massachusetts Chapit 94G ak règleman CCC.
 Mwen jis te vle mete tout moun ajou sou direktiv konferans yo.
 Kounye a mwen pral kòmanse kòmantè piblik la ak pòsyon kesyon ak repons nan reyinyon an.
 Mwen pral kòmanse pa li kesyon ak kòmantè nou te resevwa nan men rezidan yo.
 Se poutèt sa, mwen pral konfime kesyon yo te poze nan seksyon Q&A.
 Finalman, nou pral louvri kesyon jeneral ak repons.
 Sèvi ak ikòn leve men ki anba ekran an pou fè nou konnen si ou ta renmen chat.
 Moun ki rele yo ka antre nan Star Nine.
 N ap voye yon notifikasyon pou mwen epi m ap fè w konnen lè se tou w pou w poze yon kesyon oswa kòmantè.
 Ou kapab tou itilize ikòn Q&A pou mete yon kesyon pou tout moun ki pale yo wè.
 Lè sa a, mwen pral li kesyon ou a awotvwa epi mande youn nan ekspè nan sijè nou yo reponn.
 Yon fwa yo rekonèt ou kòm moun k ap pale, ou ka fèmen oswa dekole tèt ou lè l sèvi avèk ikòn mikwofòn radyo a nan app Zoom la.
 Si gen yon mak wouj, si gen yon mak wouj, liy ou a muet.
 Se konsa, kite m 'ale pi devan epi sispann. Mwen panse ke nou gen uit kesyon ak kòmantè davans.
 Mwen pral li yo nan lòd yo parèt.
 Mwen pral kite Brandon oswa nenpòt moun ki ekspè nan sijè sa a
 Pral gen yon opòtinite pou reponn, epi answit nou pral ale nan pwochen kesyon an nan pwochen seksyon an.
 Sa a kòmanse nan mwa me.
 Me, mwen regrèt mwen te mal pwononse siyati ou, men mwen te panse se te Mark Brick.
 Yon defansè boza nan Medford pou plis pase 30 ane ak fondatè Medford CATCH, C-A-T-H-E, li ekri nan Dear Theoretical Health:
 Mwen konnen premye men kijan li enpòtan pou kominote atistik la genyen yon lokal kote konferans yo ka fèt, pwogramasyon disponib pou piblik la san frè oswa yon pri minim, ak espas pou atis, estidyo, elatriye.
 Enterè nan atizay ak kilti ogmante anpil nan dènye deseni ki sot pase yo, kidonk gen yon sant kominotè pral amelyore kapasite nou pou reponn ak tandans sa a.
 Pandan senk ane ki sot pase yo, rediksyon pwogram ki gen rapò ak atizay yo te ogmante de 605 evènman yo
 a plis pase 1,000, yon ogmantasyon 65%.
 Bay 10,000 pye kare espas sou Mystic Avenue ta dwe repons a bezwen nou yo ak rèv nou yo.
 Chak vil toupre vil nou an gen yon sant kominotè atistik, kidonk nou sipòte aplikasyon w lan nan vil Medford ak tout kè w pou etabli yon biznis revente pou granmoun ki gen ladann espas pou yon sant atistik kominotè pou Medford Arts Partnership san bi likratif.
 Nan non anpil òganizasyon ki gen rapò ak atizay nan sosyete a, mwen ta renmen remèsye w pou kontribisyon w pou sipòte boza.
 Brandon san dout map baw posiblite pouw komante sa ki te voye an me.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2139.428s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: sètènman.
 Mèsi, Jonathan.
 Mwen jis vle di ou mèsi, May, pou bon pawòl ou yo e nou kontan anpil pou nou travay avèk ou menm ak kominote atistik la sou pwojè sa a.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2149.717s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Ekselan.
 Oke, pwochen kesyon soti nan Pam Shanley.
 Gen plizyè kesyon isit la, kidonk mwen pral li deklarasyon jeneral la epi answit gade chak kesyon youn pa youn.
 Bonjou, mèsi paske w fè sa isit la e mèsi pou kèk kesyon Pam, yon manm nan Catch Arts Group nan Medford ak yon rezidan nan Medford.
 Premyèman, ki relasyon ki kache ak dispansè a ak Medford Arts Group la?
 Brandon, si ou vle rezime relasyon an, mwen konnen li te deja kouvri.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2185.371s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, nou pral esansyèlman aji kòm pwopriyetè, bay espas la gratis, epi bati sant atizay la nan espesifikasyon yo pwopoze pa Arts Partnership.
 Nou pa gen okenn kontwòl operasyon oswa patisipasyon lòt pase kòm yon pwopriyetè bay lwaye gratis nan kominote a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2211.02s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Ekselan.
 Pwochen kesyon an se: èske yo gratis pou lwe espas pou klas atizay, pèfòmans ak pati?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2218.666s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, absoliman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2222.269s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Ki moun ki pral dirije Medford Arts Group la, oswa èske yo lib pou yo fè sa yo vle nan kontrent yo?
 Ki limit potansyèl sa yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2231.896s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Kidonk, mwen pa ka di twòp bagay sou jesyon koperativ arts nan pèspektiv nou.
 Mwen vle di, se yon san bi likratif ki byen dirije ak tout kalite moun k ap travay la.
 Nan pèspektiv mwen, yo lib pou yo sèvi ak espas yo panse ki pi bon pou kominote a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2257.742s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Pwochen kesyon an se yon ti kout.
 Èske mwen ka itilize Wi-Fi?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2261.113s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Oh wi, absoliman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2263.555s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: OK, tout bagay anfòm.
 De dènye yo.
 Arts, ki lè gwoup atizay Medford yo pral kapab jwenn aksè nan bilding lan?
 Eske se 24:07?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2275.425s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi.
 Wi.
 Li se yon espas konplètman separe ak dispansè a epi yo gen kontwòl konplè sou konbyen fwa yo vle moun vizite espas la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2285.853s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Ekselan.
 Dènye kesyon an se sou pakin.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2289.263s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, yo pral gen pakin tradisyonèl ak pakin aksesib ADA devan Arts Center.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2296.666s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Gran, mèsi Brandon ak mèsi Pam pou soumèt kesyon ou a.
 Mwen pral wè ou nan konferans lan tou, kidonk mwen byen kontan nou gen opòtinite pou reponn kesyon ou yo.
 Oke, twazyèm kesyon an soti nan Cindy Watson.
 Anpil etid montre ke atizay ka sove lavi, men ranvèse a ka touye tou.
 Yon espas pou atizay.
 Out pase a, Prezidan Biden te deklare ke avni nou se nan boza.
 Se yon ekspresyon nanm nou.
 Deklarasyon pwofon sa a se yon avètisman ke yo dwe pran lajan nan bidjè federal la pou finanse boza ak kilti.
 Mwen pral li atik sa a ak anpil atansyon, men jis pou dosye a, pou kesyon ak repons yo, ak pou
 Pou m ka gen opòtinite pou m pale, m ap eseye pale plis sou sijè teyori kontantman an ak patisipasyon li nan kominote a.
 Sepandan, mwen apresye kòmantè yo isit la ak mesaj sa a nou te resevwa.
 Se poutèt sa, deklarasyon sa a byen lwen se yon avètisman sou nesesite pou detounen finansman nan bidjè federal la pou atizay ak kilti.
 Kounye a, Etazini an reta byen lwen dèyè tokay Ewopeyen li yo nan finansman atizay yo.
 Li egzajere bezwen an.
 Atis atravè mond lan te sipòte lide sa a epi yo te eksprime mesaj touchan sa a.
 Pandan 15 mwa ki sot pase yo, tout sa mwen te konnen se mete aksan sou bagay ki pi fonse yo, kreye lajwa, fè sa ki byen nan chak opòtinite, epi wè bote a chak jou nan travay atis ki kwè ke li pral ede nou jwenn tèt nou ankò.
 Sa a te ede m 'e petèt li pral ede w tou.
 Mwen kwè atizay pral ede nou fè fas ak pèt lè oseyan an pa ka kenbe doulè nou an.
 Trè bon òf.
 Yo dwe felisite Depatman Byennèt Vil la pou efò li fè nan travay ak kominote atistik pou bay espas ki nesesè anpil.
 Yo rekonèt nesesite pou defann kòz nou.
 Mwen espere patenarya sa a pral reyalize.
 Pa gen dout ke li pral mete yon souri sou figi tout moun paske li se vrèman lang inivèsèl la.
 Se konsa, mèsi Cindy.
 Mwen pral bay Brandon tou yon opòtinite pou reponn kesyon sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2432.47s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, repete sa, Jonatan.
 Mèsi.
 Mèsi Cindy.
 Nou apresye mo jantiyès ou yo e nou espere travay ansanm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2443.914s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Oke, pwochen kesyon an soti nan Robert Garcia.
 Boss balon, mwen pa konnen si se mak la oswa ou pa, padon.
 Men, ki moun ki pran swen, Theory Wellness se youn nan konpayi Cannabis ki pi pwofitab nan Massachusetts.
 Yo te opere nan Bridgewater, Chicopee ak Great Barrington pou plis pase kat ane.
 Li pral pi bon patnè finansye Cannabis pou Medford ak kontribyab Ameriken yo.
 Dapre sa mwen konprann, yo dwe peye yo wè 3% pwofi brit la.
 Okenn lòt kandida pa ka pwoche bò kote yo.
 Se konsa, nou kapab.
 Pa gen okenn dout sou li.
 Men mwen pral bay Brandon yon lòt chans pou l reponn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2481.071s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, mèsi, Jonathan.
 Mwen panse sa, mwen panse ke li te posede yon biznis lokal.
 Jis pou klarifye, nan yon pèspektiv ekonomik nou pral aktyèlman pataje 6% nan revni an, pa pwofi yo, kidonk bay plis finansman nan vil la, ki ta dwe ede wete fado a sou lòt kontribyab yo ak tout lòt bagay yo pral pran swen.
 Se konsa, sètènman nou vle ede kominote a nan fason sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2506.076s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Ekselan.
 Oke, sa a soti nan Sylvia Garcia.
 Mwen menm, Sylvia Garcia, mwen sipòte
 Teyori sante ak aplikasyon w pou nonmen yon dispansè Cannabis sou aplikasyon mistè a paske mwen te wè plan w yo ak bilding lan sanble bèl.
 Mwen espesyalman renmen ke biznis la Cannabis sitiye nan dèyè bilding lan, lwen lari a ak soti nan je tout moun, pandan y ap devan bilding lan pral gen yon itilizasyon separe ki pa Cannabis.
 Se konsa, sa a soti nan
 Sylvia ap viv nan Medford.
 Mwen pap pibliye adrès li, men li konekte kòm rezidan e nou apresye sa.
 Brandon, mwen pral ba ou yon lòt chans pou reponn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2547.392s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Non, nou apresye kòmantè ou, Sylvia.
 Mèsi pou sipò ou.
 Nou sètènman dakò, ak jan ou mansyone, lè nou te fè yon sondaj vaste sou rezidan Medford pi bonè ane sa a, nou tande byen fò ak klè ke moun te vle granmoun yo fimen marigwana, men yo te vle fè li nan yon kote izole, epi nou bay opòtinite pafè a isit la.
 Se konsa, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2570.233s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Mèsi, Brandon.
 Sa a soti nan
 Melissa Miguel, yon lòt rezidan Medford, mwen pa vle reli tout diskou sa a.
 Li te ekri ofisyèl vil yo: M ap ekri jodi a pou m eksprime sipò mwen pou teyori byennèt la ak sit pwopoze a sou Mystic Avenue nan South Medford.
 Kòm yon rezidan ki dire lontan nan South Medford, mwen kontan wè Patnè Kominotè Responsab ak Patnè Kominotè Responsab ki enterese fè biznis nan kominote nou an.
 Yo gen yon istwa long nan Cannabis nan Massachusetts epi yo pran sekirite trè oserye.
 Yo bay siveyans 24 èdtan sou pwopriyete w la epi asire yo pa vyole vi prive pwopriyete prive nan zòn ki antoure a.
 Medford te fè yon move travay pou atire biznis nan zòn Sid Medford e mwen espere ke sa pral chanje ak apwobasyon Mystic Avenue Dairy Health Center.
 Brandon, mwen pral ba ou yon lòt opòtinite pou fè kòmantè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2629.179s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, non, nou apresye sipò ou, Melissa.
 Nou sètènman kwè epi dakò avèk ou ke prezans nou nan 162 Mystic Ave pral ogmante sekirite jeneral nan kominote sa a epi bay nouvo kliyan nan lòt biznis lokal ki pral achte avèk nou.
 Kliyan sa yo pral definitivman vizite vwazen nou yo tou.
 Se poutèt sa nou panse ke sa a se yon bon bagay pou kominote biznis Sid Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2659.97s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: klere.
 Pwochen kesyon an soti nan Jonathan Fagan.
 Li te di, bonjou.
 Non mwen se Jonathan Fagan.
 Mwen se yon manm konsèy CATCH ak fondatè Medford Jazz Festival la.
 Mwen ta renmen repete sipò mwen pou aplikasyon Siri Wellness anvan reyinyon jodi a, sitou paske yo te pwopoze yo pou bay kominote a 10,000 pye kare espas atistik, yon nouvo espas ki pral sipòte boza pèfòman ak vizyèl ki peye.
 Jwe yon gwo wòl nan revitalize kominote atistik la an jeneral, espesyalman konsidere kantite espas ki te fèmen nan dènye mwa yo.
 Vitrina Mystic Avenue a pral bay vizibilite ki nesesè anpil, espesyalman pou pent ak lòt atis ki vle montre travay yo nan pi laj kominote a.
 Kenbe m 'enfòme sou reyinyon an, ki jan li ale, epi kite m' konnen ki lòt bagay mwen kapab fè pou pi byen ede Johnson.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2712.832s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, non, mèsi, Jonathan.
 Nou apresye jantiyès ou ak sipò ou epi sètènman akeyi opòtinite pou bay espas pou boza.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2728.183s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Ekselan.
 Oke, dènye kesyon soti nan Jéssica Rubitico.
 Padon si mwen te mal pwononse siyati a la.
 Mwen kontan sipòte teyori Mystic Avenue pou santi m byen.
 Yo fè anpil efò pou pote atizay Medford sou sit Mystic Avenue yo.
 Art yo nan Medford pa janm gen yon kay, e li lè.
 Mèsi Siri, nou renmen ou.
 Sa a soti nan Jessica epi li abite nan Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2759.583s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, mèsi, Jessica.
 Nou trè rekonesan pou sipò ou epi nou ta kontan ak ere si nou ta ka avanse ak pwojè sa a epi mete Sant Atizay la kanpe ak fonksyone.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2771.817s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Bon, mèsi Brandon.
 Sa a konkli kesyon yo te soulve pi bonè.
 Kounye a mwen pral ale nan seksyon Q&A.
 Mwen jis vle di pou dosye a ke gen 18 moun ki nan prezans.
 Sa a soti nan Brenda Brie.
 Ki òganizasyon atistik Medford ou travay avèk?
 Mwen panse ke nou pral klarifye sa ankò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2793.761s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, òganizasyon an rele Arts Collaborative.
 Sa a se yon òganizasyon ki fèk etabli san bi likratif
 Mwen konnen sa a se yon kolaborasyon ant plizyè gwoup atistik ki egziste nan Medford ki te reyini ansanm pou ede nou konsepsyon espas pou kominote atistik la, kidonk se yo menm ki pral teknikman soulwe espas teyorik la gratis.
 Kidonk, Arts Collaborative se non òganizasyon atizay nou travay avèk yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2825.547s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Mèsi, Brandon.
 Pwochen kesyon... Oke, gwo.
 Padon, sa a se nouvo teritwa.
 Danny Leon mande: Èske Brandon ka klarifye pwopriyetè li nan Temescal Wellness?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2847.619s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, mwen panse... Mwen patisipe nan yon konpayi nan New Hampshire ki se yon san bi likratif ki rele Temescal Wellness.
 Anpil, anpil ane de sa.
 Mwen pa posede, patisipe, kontwole, oswa konprann anyen ki gen rapò ak 10 Minute Health Massachusetts.
 Se konsa, non, pa gen okenn pwopriyete la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2870.754s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Mèsi, Brandon.
 Yon lòt soti nan Dan Leon, èske ou ka eksplike pwopriyetè a nan Theory Farms?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2881.58s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Se konsa, Theory Farms, se yon pwojè ki te kòmanse pa mwen menm ak kèk nan lòt fondatè yo nan Theory e li tout te kòmanse kèk ane de sa lè li te resevwa yon lisans pwovizwa.
 Nou pa janm avanse ak pwojè a e an reyalite anile pèmi a.
 Kidonk, mwen pa konnen pwopriyetè aktyèl la nan Theory Farms, byenke mwen kwè yo pral chanje non an nan yon lòt lè yo jwenn lisans lan.
 Men, nou pa enterese kounye a nan fèm teyorik.
 OK</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2913.761s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Mèsi Brendan.
 Kesyon final la ak repons soti nan Brenda Breath.
 Ki jan espas pakin yo divize ant famasi ak espas atizay?
 Èske pral gen kèk espas rezève pou tout moun?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2925.963s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, mwen panse ke lè nou finalize plan lokal yo ak plan devlopman atravè kolaborasyon boza, nou pral kapab pale plis sou fason nou vle jere pakin.
 Um, mwen panse jeneralman, nou vle asire w ke pakin rezève pou, um, atizay kolaborasyon, um, osi lontan ke yo bezwen li, ou konnen, dwat devan espas la.
 Apre sa, si yo gen yon evènman pi gwo, mwen panse ke nou vle gen yon patenarya ak ekip jesyon famasi nou an asire w ke nou ap prepare pou jere sa.
 Pou pi gwo evènman, si li ta ka gen enpak sou pwòp operasyon nou yo, nou ka sètènman pwofite pakin nan sou sit la pou jere sa epi, ou konnen, nou ka itilize ogmante si sa nesesè, tankou fè anplwaye nou yo pake lòt bò lari a pou yon jou oswa konsa.
 Men, avèk 59 espas pakin sou plas, mwen trè konfidan ke nou p ap gen okenn pwoblèm pakin epi nou pral konplètman prepare pou asire tout moun ka jwenn yon espas rapid ak fasil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2981.528s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Ekselan.
 Mèsi, Brandon.
 Mwen pa wè kesyon ankò nan pòsyon Q&A nan chat Zoom la epi mwen pral ale sou moun k ap leve men yo.
 Se konsa, mwen ale jwenn Ken Krause.
 Ken, nou pral pèmèt ou limen mic ak videyo ou si ou vle.
 Donk wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3002.521s">[Ken Krause]</a>: ou ka tande mwen?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3003.862s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3004.522s">[Ken Krause]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Wi, Ken Krause.
 Rezidan Medford pou 21 ane.
 Pandan tan sa a mwen te patisipe patikilyèman nan òganizasyon atizay ak anviwònman an.
 Mwen trè eksite pou pwospè yon sant atizay ki se akimilasyon nan prèske 15 ane travay kontinyèl pa moun nan kominote atizay la.
 Medford Arts Collaborative
 Mwen te rete la pandan plizyè ane epi mwen te gade kèk kote.
 Sa a trè enteresan.
 Mon ti a kontan osi ki lotel i met lanfaz lo soutenabilite.
 Se konsa, mwen gen de kesyon.
 Premye a,
 Pwobableman repons ki pi kout la.
 Konsènan konstriksyon pwopriyete a, mwen pa wè okenn pye bwa nan imaj kout yo bay la.
 An jeneral, gen yon gwo mank de pye bwa sou Mystic Avenue e mwen t ap mande si ou gen yon plan jaden pou wè si gen potansyèl oswa si ou planifye pou ajoute pye bwa nan pwopriyete a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3066.07s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, mèsi Ken.
 Sa a se Brandon.
 Mwen ka reponn kesyon sa a.
 Premyerman, di ou mèsi pou sipò ou ak respè pou boza.
 Nick ak mwen menm, fondatè Teyori, pran swen pwofondman sou dirab epi apresye kòmantè yo sou kouvèti pyebwa.
 Plan aménagement nou yo poko finalize, donk mwen ka sètènman konsidere sa.
 Mwen panse ke nou sètènman vle ajoute
 Ajoute li nan jaden flè.
 Ou konnen, gen kèk opozisyon.
 Soti nan yon pèspektiv sekirite, nou pa vle bloke kamera nou yo oswa nenpòt bagay tankou sa, men sèten zòn nan sit la ka definitivman itilize kèk kouvèti pyebwa yo ajoute kèk lonbraj.
 Alor mon krwar sa i en bon pwen.
 Bon nouvèl la se nou poko finalize plan jaden nou yo.
 Se konsa, nou ka sètènman pran sa an kont.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3109.836s">[Ken Krause]</a>: Oke, mèsi.
 Dezyèm kesyon mwen an se, mwen te pale ak moun ki nan kominote rekiperasyon an e yo trè enterese nan yo te kapab fasilman sipòte sant atistik la ak asiste evènman laba ak petèt gen yon estidyo la.
 Enkyetid yo te gen rapò ak konfyans yo ke yo te kapab viv alèz
 Vizite yon kote ki trè pre famasi a, dwat dèyè li.
 Ou mansyone yon bagay sou espas ki konplètman separe, ki mwen panse ki enpòtan, epi tou strik politik pa gen okenn konsomasyon sou sit la.
 Mwen t ap mande si ou ta ka pale yon ti kras plis sou konfigirasyon espas ki pwòch yo epi si gen espas pataje?
 Èske gen yon antre separe?
 Èske gen nenpòt lòt detay ki ta ka ede nou konprann ki jan de antite sa yo travay ansanm endividyèlman?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3183.104s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, non, mèsi, Ken.
 Sa a se yon trè bon kesyon.
 Kèk pwen pou reponn.
 Premye a tout, yo se espas konplètman diferan, ka aktyèlman gen yon zòn depo vid ant yo, ou konnen, men pa gen absoliman okenn fason jwenn aksè nan youn nan lòt la.
 Antre a tou konplètman endepandan.
 Anplis de sa, kounye a nou opere yon dispansè ak sou tan nou te reyèlman aprann ki jan asire ke nou an
 Biznis la ap dirije trè diskrètman, tankou yon magazen an detay, kidonk yon pwofàn ta ka pa menm konnen sa nou fè sof si yo vin jwenn nou pou achte Cannabis.
 Pou egzanp, magazen an pa pral emèt odè paske tout pwodwi yo sele ak pre-anbalaj anvan yo rive nan kote a.
 Ou konnen, nou pa gen gwo krich echantiyon ak marigwana ak lòt bagay konsa.
 Nan sans sa a li trè pwofesyonèl ak diskrè.
 Sa a aplike tou pou planifikasyon sit nou an.
 Se konsa, gade nan bilding nou an definitivman anbeli kote a, men nou pa fè sa nou fè flachi.
 Pa gen fèy marigwana la.
 Pa gen limyè lumineuz k ap flache.
 Li trè pwofesyonèl ak diskrè.
 Mwen absoliman konprann enkyetid sa yo, epi yo sètènman trè valab.
 Pi bon nan tout, lè nou travay ak kolaborasyon boza,
 Si pwoblèm parèt, nou pral byen vit diskite sou fason pou rezoud yo epi amelyore nenpòt pwoblèm oswa pwen friksyon pou asire tout moun jwenn plis nan patenarya a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3286.031s">[Ken Krause]</a>: Mèsi anpil.
 Bon chans.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3288.373s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3307.686s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: Detounen.
 Wi, mwen jis vle remèsye ou anpil paske w bay diskou sa a jodi a.
 Sa a se trè itil.
 Kesyon mwen an se: mwen pa sèten: ki kote plant Cannabis yo pral grandi?
 Sou plas oswa deyò?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3331.624s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, sa se yon bon kesyon, Me.
 Mèsi paske w poze kesyon sa a.
 Se poutèt sa, nou se yon konpayi entegre vètikal, ki pèmèt nou benefisye de grandi pwòp plant Cannabis nou yo.
 Se konsa, nou fè sa nan de kote andeyò Medford, Massachusetts.
 Se poutèt sa, marigwana pa pral grandi nan Medford.
 Nou te grandi andedan kay la.
 Se konsa, nou gen yon fèm andedan kay la nan Bridgwater ak yon fèm Cannabis deyò nan Sheffield, Berkshire.
 Lè sa a, pwodwi yo seche, teste, pake, ak anbake nan dispansè pou vann, men pa gen okenn faktori sou sit.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3373.481s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: Mèsi, Brandon.
 Mwen jis vle di ki jan li enpòtan pou Medford ak kominote atistik la finalman gen yon kay.</p>

 Kòm sa yo, nou gen manm CACHE, Medford Arts Council, ak Medford School of the Arts, ansanm ak lòt moun ki gen enterè nan kominote atistik la.
 Se poutèt sa nou pote yon richès eksperyans ak konesans nan kominote atistik Medford.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3493.12s">[Ken Krause]</a>: Mèsi.
 Wi, yon lòt kesyon te rive m '.
 Mwen pa t gade etid trafik ou mansyone a.
 Sa a pran an kont trafik kamyon antre ak soti nan sit la, ki gen ladan livrezon ak lòt bagay ki ka rive.
 Èske w ap pran transpò pou ale ak soti nan kote a, oswa ou pral fè li antyèman tèt ou?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3521.245s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi nan kou.
 Oke, definitivman yon bon kesyon, Ken.
 Jis kòm yon rapèl pou telespektatè nou yo, an jeneral, nou gen, oswa mwen regrèt pou di, vil Medford afiche sou sit entènèt vil la aplikasyon konplè pou tout aplikan pou dispansè Medford, ki gen ladan yon kopi plan transpò nou an.
 Men, esansyèlman,
 Repons konsènan transpò a se ke nou pral gen sèlman yon machin livrezon ki vwayaje nan Medford kèk fwa pa semèn.
 Se poutèt sa, sa a pa pral gen yon enpak materyèl sou trafik.
 Sa yo se kamyon Ford Transit.
 Yo pa 18 wou.
 Mwen swete nou te okipe konsa, men nou pa.
 Yo se tou senpleman kamyon transpò ki delivre marigwana yon fwa oswa de fwa pa semèn.
 Pa anbake soti nan Medford.
 Se poutèt sa, sèlman fèk ap rantre livrezon yo fè.
 Diskrètman, pa pandan lè travay, nenpòt ki lè nan jounen an.
 Se poutèt sa, deplase sèlman kèk kamyon pa semèn pa pral gen yon enpak enpòtan sou trafik.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3588.006s">[Ken Krause]</a>: OK, mèsi.
 Mwen te eseye telechaje aplikasyon an men li se apeprè 108 MB.
 Se poutèt sa li fatigan anpil.
 Sa a se jis twòp pou ti òdinatè mwen an okipe.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3600.131s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Wi, non, li trè laj.
 Men, nou mete anpil reflechi nan pwopozisyon nou an.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se sètènman yon fason yo konsidere longè demann lan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3612.856s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Mèsi Ken.
 Mwen jis pral netwaye lyen patisipan an.
 Oke, mwen pa gen okenn lòt kesyon nan Q&A, epi mwen pa wè okenn lòt men leve.
 Jis nan tan, Danny.
 Danny Leone, èske w se yon operatè MSO milti-eta?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3635.709s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Se konsa, mak nou an, Theory Wellness, tou opere nan Maine.
 Sepandan, nan kontèks pwopozisyon Theory Wellness Incorporated sa a, nou se yon konpayi ki baze nan Massachusetts, epi sèlman nan Massachusetts.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3655.418s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Oke, gwo.
 Sa a se yon emisyon an dirèk.
 Oke, mwen ap gade tou nan seksyon an Q&A.
 Map tcheke tou chèn patisipan an pou wè si gen moun ki leve men yo.
 Mwen pa wè okenn nan moman sa a.
 Mwen panse ke nou pral gen yon dènye apèl.
 Enfòmasyon pou kontakte yo disponib tou si gen nenpòt kesyon.
 Ou konnen, kisa pou w panse.
 Mwen konnen yo te poste yon imèl pou kontakte yo e mwen sèten yo pral reseptif a nenpòt konvèsasyon ki parèt apre reyinyon aswè a.
 Kidonk, èske moun ki vle pale oswa ki vle rantre nan chat la gen nenpòt kesyon?
 Mèsi.
 Mwen te resevwa yon kopi nan men Ken.
 Ken Krause mande: Èske ou ka di nou ki pwochen etap yo nan pwosesis seleksyon an?
 Mwen devine sa a se pou Medford, pa eta a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3713.547s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Natirèlman, Medford gen yon Komite Konsiltatif Marigwana ki fòme ak diferan ofisyèl nan vil Medford.
 Aktyèlman yo ap evalye pwopozisyon yo e esansyèlman seleksyone twa kandida pou rekòmande pou majistra a pou sa yo rele yon akò kominote akèy, ki se pwochen etap la nan pwosesis la.
 Konpreyansyon nou se ke sa ki te diskite jiskaprezan se ke rekòmandasyon yo pral finalize nan fen mwa Out epi Lè sa a, Majistra a ka imedyatman jwenn yon akò ak kominote lame a.
 Si nou gen chans pou yo chwazi nou, nou ka aplike pou yon lisans leta, aplike pou yon lisans espesyal nan ZBA a, epi pare pou kòmanse konstriksyon dispansè ak sant atizay la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3772.758s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Mèsi, Brandon.
 Oke, mwen pral ale pi devan epi fè yon dènye apèl.
 Ken te ekri nan Q&A.
 Mèsi.
 Donk, si yon moun gen plis kesyon, mwen pral kenbe dènye apèl la pou apeprè yon minit.
 Men, mwen devine kounye a nou jis vle di mèsi ak tout moun ki koute, patisipe, kòmante, oswa poze kesyon.
 Sa a se yon konvèsasyon kominote konstriktif
 Li enpòtan pou konsève ak soutni fòs karaktè kominote a.
 Mèsi ak tout moun ki te pran tan pou vin jwenn nou.
 Si w gen nenpòt lòt kesyon, tanpri, ezite kontakte kandida a atravè adrès imel la sou ekran an lakay ou.
 Sa a se yon kominote emorywellness.org.
 Mwen vle tcheke lyen Q&A ak lyen patisipan an ankò pou wè si gen nenpòt kesyon final mwen pa wè isit la.
 Mèsi ankò, Brandon.
 Mwen pral voye li ba ou si ou vle li fèmen.
 Gen dènye di a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3832.568s">[Brandon Pollock]</a>: Natirèlman pa, mèsi Jonathan.
 Mèsi tout moun pou atansyon nou ak prezans nan reyinyon sa a.
 Nou espere opòtinite pou vin yon manm kominote Medford isit la.
 Nou pran angajman pou opere yon famasi vrèman klas mondyal ki benefisye kominote a nan plizyè fason enpòtan.
 Jan Jonatan te mansyone, si ou gen nenpòt lide, tanpri ou lib pou kontakte nou.
 Nou sètènman gen yon politik pòt ouvè e nou anvi diskite ak diskite nenpòt kesyon moun genyen sou pwopozisyon nou yo.
 Mwen swete nou tout yon bon sware e mèsi ankò pou vini.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3871.666s">[Jonathan Capano]</a>: Mèsi tout moun epi pase yon bon nwit.</p>
