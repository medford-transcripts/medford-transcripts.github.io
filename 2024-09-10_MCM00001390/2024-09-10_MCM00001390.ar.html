 ព័ត៌មានលម្អិតមួយចំនួនអំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះគឺជាការជូនដំណឹងអំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំសាធារណៈនេះត្រូវបានបោះពុម្ពផ្សាយនៅក្នុងកាសែត Medford Transcript នៅថ្ងៃទី 8 ខែកក្កដា ឆ្នាំ 2021។

 ទីក្រុង Medford ក៏បានប្រកាសកិច្ចប្រជុំនៅលើគេហទំព័ររបស់ខ្លួនផងដែរ។
 កំណត់ចំណាំរហ័សមួយចំនួនដែលខ្ញុំចង់បន្ថែមគឺថាកិច្ចប្រជុំរួមបញ្ចូលសមត្ថភាពក្នុងការបង្កើតចំណងជើងបិទសម្រាប់អ្នកដែលត្រូវការពួកវាជាផ្នែកនៃស្ថានភាព។

 ដូច្នេះ ចំណងជើងរងគឺតែងតែមានសម្រាប់អ្នកដែលត្រូវការវា។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាលក្ខណៈពិសេសនេះគឺនៅក្នុងម៉ឺនុយទាញចុះក្រោមនៅផ្នែកខាងក្រោមនៃអេក្រង់។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=601.659s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome everyone to our community outreach meeting.
 It is a privilege to be able to discuss our plans with you all this evening, and I very much look forward to the chance to answer your questions and respond to your comments later on in the meeting.
 As a bit of background, I am one of the founders of Theory Wellness, a local cannabis organization that is headquartered in Stoneham.
 We were founded in 2015 and our mission is to create the highest quality dispensary experience for our local communities, our customers, and our employees.
 We have a long and successful track record of operating compliant, safe, and community-centric dispensaries in the Commonwealth, and now employ approximately 300 talented team members here in Massachusetts, providing living wages and a comprehensive benefit package, including a 401k plan.
 We are well known as one of the most respected cannabis organizations in the state, routinely meeting with a variety of cannabis industry stakeholders and regulators to help improve how legal cannabis works here in Massachusetts.
 We take our responsibility to operate as industry leaders very seriously and would be honored to bring our world-class operations to Medford.
 Our first dispensary is a medical only facility that we opened in Bridgewater in 2017.
 We have since then grown to operate two other dispensaries in Massachusetts, one in Chicopee and one in Great Barrington, both of which serve medical patients and adult use customers.
 The Great Barrington location was one of the first recreational stores to open in the state, and that was in January of 2019.
 So this has given us over two years of experience, which is very helpful here in Medford, on how to operate these businesses successfully.
 Thierry also operates indoor and outdoor cultivation facilities and manufactures a wide variety of products.
 In sum, we operate 10 different cannabis licenses here in Massachusetts, which is equal or more to any operational experience of any other business in the state.
 Having at this point served over 1 million different customers in Massachusetts, we look forward to bringing our extensive experience and track record to our South Medford neighborhood.
 Next slide, please.
 After that as well, please.
 So community is very important for us at Theory.
 And that's one of the unique aspects on how we run our business is our approach to community relations.
 We believe the relationship begins by being good listeners, understanding the concerns and desires from all the stakeholders in the community.
 From day one, Theory has listened to and worked closely with our communities to develop positive working relationships that extend from government officials to local businesses, to grassroots organizations, and most importantly, local residents.
 Theory was one of the first cannabis companies in the state to develop a host community agreement, working with the town of Bridgewater since 2016 to share a portion of our revenue with the town to support their municipal programming.
 Since then, Theory has contributed over $8 million in direct financial contributions to our host communities.
 Beyond hiring locally and providing significant economic stimulus, we have focused on building long-term collaborative relationships with municipal governments, as well as local community organizations.
 We have launched an educational series on cannabis, sponsored numerous charitable events, hosted food and clothing drives, and supported over 20 nonprofits in our local communities.
 We look forward to continue on this path with our new project here in Medford.
 Next slide, please.
 So this slide is an overview of our site plan.
 We're proposing a marijuana retailer to be located at 162 Mystic Avenue.
 The site is currently vacant and was previously used as a car dealership.
 Our proposal is to completely renovate and beautify not just the building, but the entire site.
 We searched for over a year to find the perfect location for a dispensary and are extremely happy to be proposing a location at 162 Mystic Ave for a variety of reasons, which will be detailed throughout the presentation.
 These reasons include first and foremost parking.
 This site includes 59 parking stalls with the site plan that you're looking at right now, which is critical to ensure that no traffic issues arise and that we have no nuisance to our neighborhood.
 Number two, the details of the site are pretty unique.
 As shown in the site plan, we have selected a building that has enough space to not just house a dispensary, but also donate 10,000 square feet of space to the arts community, which we will look forward to providing more information on in the upcoming slides.
 Another key benefit of this proposal is that we are able to develop the dispensary in the rear of the building, ensuring that the dispensary is discreetly featured on Mystic Avenue and not front and center.
 Earlier this year, we commissioned a poll of over 250 Medford residents, and it was clear that the majority of residents preferred a dispensary to be discreetly cited like this proposal and not prominently on a main road.
 Next slide, please.
 In respect to zoning compliance, as Jonathan mentioned earlier, Medford has a zoning ordinance that designates the C2 and industrial zones as the two areas in the city where an adult-use dispensary can operate.
 This use is subject to obtaining a special permit from the Zoning Board of Affairs, and there are not regulations from the local health board pertaining to dispensaries.
 That being said, theory has proposed a comprehensive plan to monitor local health impacts and looks forward to working with the Medford Health Department to safely operate our business.
 Our site at 162 Mystic Ave is in the C2 district and is in full compliance with the city's zoning ordinance.
 Importantly, we are over 500 feet away from any K through 12 schools, as shown as a diagram here.
 We have already fully designed our site and construction plans and look forward to working with local builders and contractors when we are ready to construct our facility.
 Renderings of our exterior and interior are provided on the following slides.
 Next slide, please.
 Perfect.
 So this is the proposed exterior of the dispensary.
 As you can see, we, you know, are renovating the entire site and really beautifying the exterior of the building.
 Next slide.
 The proposed interior rendering is where we create a welcoming, bright, and safe environment for our guests.
 Next slide.
 So now we're going to talk about a very interesting partnership we have here with the arts community in Medford.
 A core value of ours, and one of the primary reasons of our success to date, is our steadfast commitment to contributing in meaningful ways to the communities that we operate in.
 In Medford, we are extremely excited and fortunate to be proposing a variety of ways in which we will expect to benefit the community.
 First and foremost, we have established a tremendous partnership with the arts community in Medford.
 For the last six months, we have had discussions with local leaders in the arts community and learned that despite good efforts and intentions, the arts community in Medford has never been able to find a home.
 That will all change with Theory Medford.
 We have committed to donating 10,000 square feet of our building to the Arts Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that will help manage this brand new arts center.
 In addition to providing the space free of charge, Theory will completely renovate the space to the specifications necessary to provide this community benefit.
 This will create studio space, meeting space, office space, and performing space for the arts.
 Our architect has already been working on preliminary floor plans as mentioned on this slide and we couldn't be happier with the partnership and if all goes to plan we would have the community art center up and running in early 2022.
 Next slide.
 Theory understands that diversity, inclusion, and equal opportunity are necessary foundational pillars in building a strong team that represents the communities we operate in and facilitates the creation of a value-driven organization.
 Theory also recognizes how the war on drugs disproportionately affected certain communities of color.
 As leaders in the cannabis industry, we have a real responsibility to lead by example, create positive change, and foster opportunities for generational wealth creation for those who have been negatively affected by the unjust historical policies.
 To that end, in 2019 theory launched a first of its kind social equity program, providing $250,000 in no strings attached zero interest financing.
 In addition to resources training and coaching to an economic empowerment applicant who is in the process of launching their own dispensary.
 After interviewing around a dozen qualified applicants, in July of 2019, Theory selected entrepreneurs Vanessa Jean Baptiste and Mark Bouquet of Legal Greens to be the first participants in our program.
 Legal Greens is comprised of these two business partners, both Black, one being a woman, who grew up and reside in neighborhoods that were adversely affected by the war on drugs.
 After nearly two years, in March 2021, Legal Greens opened their recreational dispensary in Brockton, becoming the first Black-owned
 woman-owned recreational dispensary on the East Coast.
 We're very proud of the team at Legal Greens and look forward to replicating this program in Medford if we're fortunate enough to continue on with our project here.
 Additionally, Theory is committed to hiring a diverse workforce in Medford.
 We truly believe that our people is what allows our company to be most successful and that diversity is an asset to any organization.
 proven to foster improved decision-making, increased innovation, stronger customer relationships, and increased employee engagement.
 In Medford, Theory has worked closely with the Mystic branch of the NAACP on a comprehensive diversity hiring plan.
 We are committed to creating a workforce that is at least 50% women, 35% diverse, and 5% veteran, with this goal extending through all management positions.
 Theory offers terrific advancement opportunities and goes through great lengths in our recruitment process to ensure we are hiring without bias or discrimination.
 Next slide, please.
 A major driver of our positive impact in Medford will be economic.
 First, we plan on hiring over 60 well-paid full-time individuals with a mandate that the workforce is diverse and local.
 Specifically, at least 75% of our employees will be Medford residents.
 All team members are provided comprehensive benefits, which include a 401k plan.
 We're especially proud to offer this 401k plan, which right now is not very common in the cannabis industry due to the challenges in working with finding a provider for a program like that.
 As the number one retailer in Massachusetts, we are confident in our projections that each year our Medford dispensary will provide the city with over $2 million in direct cash contributions through both tax revenue and our community host agreement.
 In addition to the commitments to donate to the arts community, Theory has also allocated $50,000 per year to support local nonprofits.
 This is consistent with our track record as we have already support dozens of nonprofits throughout the state.
 Next slide, please.
 We acknowledge and appreciate that one of the possible negative impacts from an adult use dispensary is localized traffic condition.
 In order to meet the economic development goals of the city while simultaneously avoiding any traffic congestion problems, an operator must carefully choose a location that is suitable to handle a high volume of customers.
 There are very few properties within the permitted zones in Medford that provide easy access, have sufficient parking, contain good interior space, and would not materially impact localized traffic.
 This is something that we took very seriously and we're well qualified to analyze having years of experience citing and operating high traffic retail dispensers.
 After looking at dozens of options in Medford for our proposed site, we committed to 162 Mystic Avenue based on a number of factors, including and importantly, the site's ability to serve our projected number of customer visits per day from an access parking and favorable traffic impact perspective.
 Our location is a former car dealership located two minutes off 93 with 59 parking stalls, significantly more than what our projected daily customer visits would demand as further detailed below.
 By comparison, in Great Barrington and Chicopee, where we also operate recreational dispensaries, our location served between 600 and over 1,000 customers per day on busy days with less parking capacity and have had zero material traffic issues to date.
 To demonstrate the suitability of our proposed location, Theory engaged a professional traffic engineering and analysis firm to perform a comprehensive traffic study.
 This 27-page traffic study concluded that our operation of a marijuana retailer at 162 Mystic Avenue would not negatively impact traffic on Mystic Ave.
 Furthermore, as we have done at our other locations, we will work closely with the Medford Police Department to ensure we have a comprehensive traffic control plan in place, including police details as necessary for the initial opening period.
 Next slide, please.
 Our track record and experience showcase that our operational plans and staff training will lead to the safe operations of a marijuana retailer in Medford, including ensuring that diversion and underage sales do not take place at our location.
 We have served over 1 million customers in Massachusetts without any underage sales.
 We check identification three times, once at the door, once in the reception room, and again at the sales counter.
 Furthermore, we use a machine called ID Science that scans each identification for validity.
 This equipment is also used in casinos and updates itself every 30 days with a
 comprehensive database of all valid forms of state ID across the country, as well as all passports in the world.
 By using this machine, we have caught hundreds of expired or invalid forms of identification at our other locations.
 All of our products are secured in the vault, which has extensive security features.
 We are also constantly monitoring our parking areas and have a zero tolerance policy for consumption of cannabis on site.
 Any customers that are found to be consuming on site would be permanently banned from returning to our location.
 Next slide, please.
 An important aspect to discuss is the safety and security that will be designed and implemented at our dispensary.
 It is first helpful to acknowledge and appreciate that Theory has served over a million customers with an excellent safety and security track record.
 And in our other communities, we maintain direct lines of communication with our local law enforcement partners, whom have written letters of recommendation, calling Theory a model for others to follow.
 Our comprehensive safety and security plan would first be reviewed with the Medford Police Department prior to being finalized.
 We always look forward to receiving feedback and improving our plan based on conversations with law enforcement professionals.
 At all times during operational hours, Theory has a highly trained safety and security team that works both inside and outside the dispensary.
 They are there to ensure that no prohibited activities take place on our premise.
 In large part due to our terrific safety and security team, we have not had any nuisance complaints about unsavory customer activity from any of our neighbors at our existing locations.
 Moreover, the dispensary will be outfitted with an extensive alarm and video monitoring system using the most modern technology available.
 This technology is a cornerstone of our safety and security plan and allows us to offer both a welcoming and safe environment for our guests and our neighbors.
 Next slide, please.
 Theory is committed to leading the cannabis industry by taking meaningful measures towards achieving a more sustainable future, despite the level of short-term investment it may require.
 Sustainability is a fundamental value at Theory, woven into our decision-making on a daily basis.
 To date, we have invested millions in energy-reductive technology, effectively offsetting over 2.4 million kilowatts of electricity per year by moving 90% of our cannabis cultivation operations outdoors, and have greened the majority of our energy usage by purchasing over 85% of our energy from renewable sources.
 Our plan for Medford will push our sustainability actions even further.
 We have a 79-point sustainability action plan consisting of bold measures, including the installation of 263 solar panels on our roof, pledging to electrify our vehicles, obtaining 100% of our company-wide energy needs from renewables, purchasing carbon offsets, sourcing from and supporting local businesses, installing electric vehicle charging stations, incentivizing public transportation,
 using sustainable design and building materials, and sponsoring green entrepreneurship in the city of Medford.
 To hold ourselves accountable, we will establish a director of sustainability and engage with third party consultants to audit our dispensary on a periodic basis.
 Theory admires and respects the City of Medford's ambitious goals relating to sustainability and energy efficiency and believes our operation will align with and contribute meaningfully towards a shared mission.
 We look forward to being a corporate steward and a contributing member of the Medford community.
 Next slide, please.
 Over the years, Thierry has spent extensive time in the Medford community to understand the concerns and desires of Medford residents and businesses relating to the siting and operation of a marijuana retailer.
 Thierry undertook an independent survey of over 250 Medford residents and incorporated their feedback into our proposal, ensuring that our location, our charitable initiatives, and our hiring plans serve the community best.
 Additionally, we have forged a remarkable relationship with local arts community to design, construct, and provide free ongoing use of a 10,000 square foot community center for the arts, a landmark partnership of historic value.
 Thierry has spoken extensively with hundreds of abutters, local businesses, local leaders, and residents, and received tremendous support, evidenced by the over 60 local letters of support that we've received from a variety of locations as shown in the map on this slide.
 To ensure our local relationship only continues to strengthen, Thierry will be hiring a full-time director of community relations whose primary responsibility is fostering and strengthening the quality of our relationship with the community.
 This individual will be based in Medford and will serve as the day-to-day face of Thierry and a conduit for our community relations.
 This is beyond attending and participating in meetings and community events relating to our business.
 They'll also be managing our charitable budget for local nonprofits.
 Next slide, please.
 So to sum it up, I am confident that Theory is the most qualified applicant to operate in Medford for a couple of reasons.
 First, we have the experience necessary to ensure our dispensary in Medford will be world-class.
 We have an industry-leading track record of success and safety at our other operations in Great Barrington, Chicopee, and Bridgewater.
 We have served over 1 million guests without incident, while maintaining a 99 percentile customer rating.
 We have become a model company to our regulators, our host communities, and our customers.
 We have demonstrated that we know exactly how to operate a world-class cannabis dispensary.
 Second, we have an ambitious, progressive, and well-thought-out plan for positive community impacts here in Medford.
 We have created an incredible partnership with the arts community to construct and donate a brand new 10,000 square feet center for the arts, a first-of-its-kind program for the city.
 Moreover, we will be providing over 60 well-paying jobs with full benefits in 401k, supporting local businesses and non-profits, financing local entrepreneurs and social equity applicants, and contributing to the sustainability and diversity goals of the City.
 From a pure economic perspective, we will contribute over $2 million per year to the city in direct payments, amounts we have shown to provide to our other communities.
 Third, after years of scouting, we have carefully chosen a location that we believe makes an ideal site for a dispensary from an infrastructure, traffic, and security standpoint.
 Moreover, our location reflects the desires and priorities of the local community.
 Our location at 162 Mystic Avenue is discreet, has tremendous parking, is located in a C2 district away from residential, and will be completely revitalized through our site beautification plan.
 Having been on the forefront of the industry for years, I appreciate the challenges and unknowns that this new type of business can present.
 With our comprehensive plan for positive impact, industry-leading reputation, and operating experience, I know theory would be the premier choice for the City of Medford.
 I want to thank you all for your attention so far, and now I'm going to turn it over to Jonathan for the question and answer portion of the meeting.
 Thank you, and next slide.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2139.428s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: بالتأكيد.
 شكرا جوناثان.
 أريد فقط أن أشكر ماي على كلماتك الطيبة ونحن متحمسون جدًا للعمل معك ومع المجتمع الفني في هذا المشروع.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2149.717s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مثالي.
 وافق على السؤال بعد بام شانلي.
 توجد العديد من المشكلات هنا، لذا سأقرأ العرض التقديمي الشامل ثم أتناولها واحدة تلو الأخرى.
 مرحبًا، شكرًا لوجودك هنا وشكرًا على الأسئلة القليلة، بام، عضو مجموعة كاتش آرتس في ميدفورد والمقيمة في ميدفورد.
 أولاً، ما هي العلاقة الأساسية بين المستوصف ومجموعة ميدفورد للفنون؟
 براندون. إذا كنت تريد تقييم العلاقة، أعلم أن هذا قد تم ذكره بالفعل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2185.371s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، سنلعب دورًا مهمًا باعتبارنا مالك الأرض من خلال توفير المساحة وبناء المركز الفني تمامًا كما يقترح الشريك الفني.
 ليس لدينا أي سيطرة على الأنشطة أو المشاركة بخلاف الملكية في المجتمع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2211.02s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مثالي.
 السؤال التالي: هل يمكنهم استئجار المساحة لدروس الفن والعروض والحفلات؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2218.666s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم فعلا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2222.269s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: من سيقود مجموعة Medford Arts أم أنهم أحرار في فعل ما يريدون في حدود قدراتهم؟
 ما هي هذه القيود المحتملة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2231.896s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: لذلك، لا أستطيع أن أقول الكثير عن إدارة التعاونيات الفنية من وجهة نظرنا.
 أعني أنها منظمة غير ربحية تعمل بشكل جيد مع كل من يعمل هناك.
 في رأيي، لديهم الحرية في استخدام ما يعتقدون أنه الأفضل للمجتمع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2257.742s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: السؤال التالي قصير.
 هل يمكنني استخدام الواي فاي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2261.113s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: اه بالطبع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2263.555s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: حسنًا، لا بأس.
 الأخيرين.
 الفنون متى ستتمكن مجموعة ميدفورد للفنون من دخول المبنى؟
 هذه المرة الساعة 24:07، أليس كذلك؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2275.425s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 هذا صحيح.
 وهي منفصلة تمامًا عن الصيدلية ولديها سيطرة كاملة على عدد مرات زيارة الأشخاص.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2285.853s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مثالي.
 السؤال الأخير يتعلق بوقوف السيارات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2289.263s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، سيكون هناك موقف سيارات عادي ويمكن الوصول إليه من قبل ADA أمام مركز الفنون.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2296.666s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: ល្អណាស់ អរគុណ Brandon និងអរគុណ Pam ដែលបានដាក់សំណួររបស់អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​នឹង​ជួប​អ្នក​ក្នុង​សន្និសីទ​ដែរ ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​រីករាយ​ដែល​យើង​មាន​ឱកាស​ឆ្លើយ​សំណួរ​របស់​អ្នក។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់, សំណួរទីបីគឺមកពី Cindy Watson ។
 ការសិក្សាជាច្រើនបង្ហាញថាសិល្បៈអាចជួយសង្គ្រោះជីវិតមនុស្សបាន ប៉ុន្តែផ្ទុយទៅវិញវាក៏អាចសម្លាប់ជីវិតបានដែរ។
 កន្លែងសម្រាប់សិល្បៈ។
 កាលពីខែសីហាកន្លងទៅ លោកប្រធានាធិបតី Biden បានប្រកាសថា អនាគតរបស់យើងគឺនៅក្នុងវិស័យសិល្បៈ។
 វាគឺជាការបង្ហាញនៃព្រលឹងរបស់យើង។
 សេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍ដ៏ជ្រាលជ្រៅនេះគឺជាការព្រមានថា ត្រូវតែយកលុយពីថវិកាសហព័ន្ធ ដើម្បីផ្តល់មូលនិធិដល់សិល្បៈ និងវប្បធម៌។
 ខ្ញុំ​នឹង​អាន​អត្ថបទ​នេះ​ដោយ​ប្រុង​ប្រយ័ត្ន ប៉ុន្តែ​សម្រាប់​តែ​កំណត់​ចំណាំ សម្រាប់​សំណួរ និង​ចម្លើយ និង​ដើម្បី​
 សម្រាប់ឱកាសក្នុងការនិយាយ ខ្ញុំនឹងព្យាយាមនិយាយបន្ថែមទៀតអំពីប្រធានបទនៃទ្រឹស្តីសុភមង្គល និងការចូលរួមរបស់វានៅក្នុងសហគមន៍។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ ខ្ញុំពេញចិត្តចំពោះមតិយោបល់នៅទីនេះ និងសារនេះដែលយើងបានទទួល។
 ដូច្នេះ សេចក្តីថ្លែងការណ៍​ដ៏​ធំ​នេះ​ជាការ​ព្រមាន​អំពី​តម្រូវការ​ផ្លាស់ប្តូរ​ថវិកា​ពី​ថវិកា​សហព័ន្ធ​ទៅជា​សិល្បៈ និង​វប្បធម៌។
 បច្ចុប្បន្ន​នេះ សហរដ្ឋ​អាមេរិក​នៅ​ឆ្ងាយ​ពី​ដៃគូ​អឺរ៉ុប​របស់​ខ្លួន​ក្នុង​ការ​ផ្តល់​មូលនិធិ​ដល់​សិល្បៈ។
 គាត់និយាយបំផ្លើសតម្រូវការ។
 វិចិត្រករ​ជុំវិញ​ពិភពលោក​បាន​គាំទ្រ​គំនិត​នេះ ហើយ​បាន​បញ្ចេញ​សារ​ដ៏​គួរ​ឲ្យ​ចាប់អារម្មណ៍​នេះ។
 អស់រយៈពេល 15 ខែកន្លងមកនេះ អ្វីដែលខ្ញុំដឹងគឺការរំលេចនូវអ្វីដែលងងឹតបំផុត បង្កើតភាពរីករាយ ធ្វើល្អគ្រប់ឱកាស និងមើលឃើញភាពស្រស់ស្អាតជារៀងរាល់ថ្ងៃនៅក្នុងការងាររបស់សិល្បករដែលជឿថាវានឹងជួយយើងរកឃើញខ្លួនឯង។
 វាបានជួយខ្ញុំ ហើយប្រហែលជាវានឹងជួយអ្នកផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំជឿថាសិល្បៈនឹងជួយយើងស៊ូទ្រាំនឹងការបាត់បង់នៅពេលដែលមហាសមុទ្រមិនអាចផ្ទុកការឈឺចាប់របស់យើង។
 ការផ្តល់ជូនល្អណាស់។
 មន្ទីរសុខាភិបាលទីក្រុងត្រូវបានកោតសរសើរចំពោះការខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងរួមគ្នាជាមួយសហគមន៍សិល្បៈក្នុងការផ្តល់កន្លែងដែលត្រូវការច្រើន។
 ពួកគេទទួលស្គាល់តម្រូវការដើម្បីការពារបុព្វហេតុរបស់យើង។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាកិច្ចសហប្រតិបត្តិការនេះនឹងក្លាយជាការពិត។
 គ្មានការសង្ស័យទេ វានឹងនាំមកនូវស្នាមញញឹមនៅលើមុខមនុស្សគ្រប់រូប ព្រោះវាជាភាសាសកល។
 ដូច្នេះ​សូម​អរគុណ Cindy ។
 ខ្ញុំក៏នឹងផ្តល់ឱកាសឱ្យ Brandon ឆ្លើយសំណួរនេះផងដែរ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2432.47s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، قلها مرة أخرى، جوناثان.
 شكرا لك
 شكرا لك، سيندي.
 نحن نقدر كلماتك الرقيقة ونتطلع إلى العمل معك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2443.914s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: حسنًا، السؤال التالي من روبرت جارسيا.
 رئيس البالون لا يعرف العلامة التجارية أم لا، آسف.
 ولكن من يهتم، فإن Theory Wellness هي شركة الماريجوانا الأكثر ربحية في ماساتشوستس.
 لقد كانوا يخدمون Bridgewater وChicopee وGreat Barrington لأكثر من 4 سنوات.
 سيكون هذا أفضل شريك لتمويل الماريجوانا لميدفورد ودافعي الضرائب الأمريكيين.
 وبقدر ما أفهم، يتعين عليهم دفع 3٪ من إجمالي الربح.
 ولا يمكن لأي مرشح أن يقترب منهم.
 حتى نتمكن من ذلك.
 ليس هناك شك في ذلك.
 لكنني سأعطي براندون فرصة للإجابة مرة أخرى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2481.071s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، شكرا لك، جوناثان.
 أعتقد ذلك، أعتقد أن لديه عملاً محليًا.
 ولكي نكون واضحين من الناحية الاقتصادية، فسوف نتقاسم 6% من الإيرادات، وليس الأرباح، وبالتالي نزود المدينة بتمويل إضافي من شأنه أن يخفف العبء عن دافعي الضرائب الآخرين وأي شيء آخر يقبلونه.
 لذلك نريد حقًا مساعدة المجتمع بهذه الطريقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2506.076s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مثالي.
 نعم، إنها من سيلفيا جارسيا.
 أنا، سيلفيا جارسيا، أؤيد هذا.
 تتصل نظريتك الصحية وتطبيقك بمستوصف الماريجوانا في تطبيق Mystery لأنني رأيت خططك والمبنى يبدو رائعًا.
 على وجه الخصوص، أحب أن يقع متجر الماريجوانا في الجزء الخلفي من المبنى، بعيدًا عن الطريق وبعيدًا عن الأنظار، وستكون هناك منطقة خالية من الماريجوانا في الجزء الأمامي من المبنى.
 إذن هذه هي الكلمة
 تعيش سيلفيا في ميدفورد.
 لن أنشر عنوانه، لكنه جاء كمقيم ونحن نقدر ذلك.
 براندون، سأعطيك فرصة أخرى للإجابة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2547.392s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: لا، نحن نقدر تعليقات سيلفيا.
 شكرا لدعمكم.
 نحن نتفق معك تمامًا، وكما ذكرت، عندما أجرينا مسحًا شاملاً لسكان ميدفورد في وقت سابق من هذا العام، سمعنا بوضوح أن الناس يريدون أن يدخن الكبار، لكنهم يريدون القيام بذلك في مكان هادئ، ونحن نقدم فرصة عظيمة هنا.
 شكرًا لك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2570.233s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: شكرا براندون.
 هذه هي الكلمة
 ميليسا ميغيل، مقيمة أخرى في ميدفورد، لا أريد قراءة الخطاب بأكمله مرة أخرى.
 كتب إلى مسؤولي المدينة: "أكتب اليوم للتعبير عن دعمي لنظرية الرفاهية والموقع الإلكتروني المقترح في شارع ميستيك في جنوب ميدفورد.
 باعتباري مقيمًا منذ فترة طويلة في جنوب ميدفورد، يسعدني أن أرى شركاء مجتمعيين مسؤولين وشركاء مجتمعيين مسؤولين يقومون بأعمال تجارية في مجتمعنا.
 لديهم تاريخ طويل من استخدام الماريجوانا في ماساتشوستس وهم قلقون للغاية بشأن السلامة.
 إنهم يوفرون مراقبة لممتلكاتك على مدار الساعة طوال أيام الأسبوع ويضمنون عدم المساس بخصوصية الممتلكات الخاصة القريبة.
 لقد قامت Medford بعمل رائع في جذب الأعمال إلى South Medford وآمل أن يتغير ذلك بموافقة مركز Mystic Avenue Dairy Health Center.
 براندون، سأعطيك فرصة أخرى لإثبات نفسك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2629.179s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: حسنًا، نحن نقدر دعمك يا ميليسا.
 نحن نؤمن ونتفق معك حقًا على أن وجودنا في 162 Mystic Ave سيحسن السلامة العامة لهذا المجتمع ويجذب عملاء جدد إلى الشركات المحلية الأخرى للتسوق معنا.
 من المؤكد أن هؤلاء العملاء سيزورون البلدان المجاورة لنا.
 ولهذا السبب نعتقد أن هذا أمر جيد لمجتمع الأعمال في جنوب ميدفورد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2659.97s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مشرق
 السؤال التالي هو من جوناثان فاجان.
 قال مرحبا.
 اسمي جوناثان فاجان.
 أنا عضو مجلس إدارة CATCH ومؤسس مهرجان Medford Jazz.
 أود أن أكرر دعمي لـ Siri Wellness قبل اجتماع اليوم، خاصة أنهم يقترحون تزويد المجتمع بمساحة فنية تبلغ 10000 قدم مربع، وهو مكان جديد سيدعم العروض المدفوعة وفنون الأداء.
 لعب دوراً كبيراً في تنشيط المجتمع الفني، خاصة بالنظر إلى عدد الأماكن التي تم إغلاقها في الأشهر الأخيرة.
 سيوفر معرض ميستيك أفينيو العرض الذي تشتد الحاجة إليه، خاصة للفنانين وغيرهم من الفنانين الذين يرغبون في عرض أعمالهم على المجتمع الأوسع.
 من فضلك أخبرني عن الاجتماعات، وكيفية سيرها، وأخبرني بما يمكنني فعله لتحسين جونسون.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2712.832s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: حسنًا، شكرًا جوناثان.
 نحن نقدر كرمكم ودعمكم ونرحب بشدة بفرصة توفير مساحة للفن.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2728.183s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مثالي.
 أتفق مع سؤال جيسيكا روبيتيكو الأخير.
 آسف إذا كنت مخطئا.
 يسعدني دعم نظرية بليزانت ميستيك أفينيو.
 لقد عملوا بجد لجلب الأعمال الفنية من ميدفورد إلى موقعهم في Mystic Avenue.
 لم يكن للفنون مكانًا في ميدفورد أبدًا، وقد حان الوقت.
 شكرا سيري، نحن نحبك.
 هذه من جيسيكا، تعيش في ميدفورد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2759.583s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، شكرا لك، جيسيكا.
 نشكركم بصدق على دعمكم وسنكون سعداء ومحظوظين للغاية إذا تمكنا من مواصلة هذا المشروع وتشغيل مركز الفنون.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2771.817s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: نعم، شكرا لك، براندون.
 وبهذا ينتهي السؤال الذي طرحته سابقًا.
 سأنتقل الآن إلى قسم الأسئلة والأجوبة.
 أريد فقط أن أقول أنه كان هناك 18 مشاركًا فقط.
 هذا من بريندا بري.
 ما هي منظمة ميدفورد للفنون التي تعمل معها؟
 أعتقد أننا سوف نؤكد مرة أخرى.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2793.761s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، هذه المنظمة تسمى Arts Collaborative.
 هذه منظمة غير ربحية تم إنشاؤها حديثًا.
 أعلم أن هذا تعاون بين العديد من فناني ميدفورد الذين اجتمعوا لمساعدتنا في تصميم مساحة لمجتمع الفن، لذلك من الناحية الفنية سوف يقومون بتأجير مساحة نظرية مجانية.
 إذن Arts Collaborative هو اسم منظمة الفنون التي نعمل معها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2825.547s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: شكرا براندون.
 السؤال التالي... حسنًا، جيد جدًا.
 آسف، هذه منطقة جديدة.
 يسأل داني ليون ما إذا كان براندون يستطيع إثبات ملكيته لشركة Temescal Wellness؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2847.619s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، أعتقد... انضممت إلى شركة في نيو هامبشاير، وهي منظمة غير ربحية تسمى Temescal Wellness.
 منذ سنوات عديدة.
 أنا لا أملك أو أدير أو أفهم أي شيء يتعلق بـ 10 Minute Health Massachusetts.
 لذلك لا توجد ثروة هناك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2870.754s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: شكرا براندون.
 قصة أخرى من دان ليون، هل يمكنك شرح صاحب Theory Farms؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2881.58s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: لذا فإن Theory Farms هو مشروع بدأته بنفسي وعدد قليل من مؤسسي Theory، وقد بدأ كل شيء منذ بضع سنوات عندما حصل على ترخيص مؤقت.
 لم نستمر أبدًا في المشروع وقمنا بالفعل بإلغاء التصريح.
 لذلك لا أعرف من يملك حاليًا Theory Farms، لكنني أفترض أنهم سيغيرون اسمهم إلى اسم آخر عندما يحصلون على الترخيص.
 لكننا لسنا مهتمين بالمزارع النظرية الآن.
 بخير</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2913.761s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: شكرا لك، بريندان.
 السؤال والإجابة الأخيرة جاءت من بريندا ديتش.
 كيف يتم تقسيم مواقف السيارات بين الصيدلية والمساحة الفنية؟
 هل هناك مجال للجميع؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2925.963s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، أعتقد أنه بمجرد الانتهاء من الخطة المحلية وخطة التطوير من خلال التعاون الفني، يمكننا التحدث أكثر عن الطريقة التي نريد بها إدارة مواقف السيارات.
 حسنًا، بالطبع، نعم، أعرف ذلك، لماذا هو شيء معروف مسبقًا باسم ساحة انتظار السيارات.
 وإذا كان لديهم حدث أكبر، أعتقد أننا نريد العمل مع فريق إدارة الصيدلية لدينا للتأكد من أننا مستعدون للتعامل معه.
 بالنسبة للأحداث الكبيرة، إذا كان ذلك قد يؤثر على عملياتنا، فيمكننا استخدام مواقف السيارات في الموقع لمعالجة هذه المشكلة، وكما تعلمون، يمكننا استخدام ذلك إذا لزم الأمر، مثل ترك موظفينا في الشارع لمدة يوم أو أكثر.
 ولكن نظرًا لوجود 59 مكانًا لوقوف السيارات في الموقع، فأنا واثق تمامًا من أننا لن نواجه أي مشاكل في مواقف السيارات وسنكون على استعداد تام لضمان حصول الجميع على مكان لوقوف السيارات بسرعة وسهولة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=2981.528s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: مثالي.
 شكرا براندون.
 لم أعد أرى أي أسئلة في قسم الأسئلة والأجوبة في Zoom chat وسوف أستمر لمن يرفعون أيديهم.
 لذلك ذهبت إلى كين كراوس.
 كين، سوف نسمح لك بتشغيل الميكروفون والفيديو إذا أردت.
 لذا نعم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3002.521s">[Krause]</a>: أيمكنك سماعي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3003.862s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: في.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3004.522s">[Krause]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 نعم، كين كراوس.
 عاش في ميدفورد لمدة 21 عاما.
 خلال هذا الوقت، شاركت بنشاط في المنظمات الفنية والبيئية.
 أنا متحمس لتوقعات مركز الفنون، ذروة ما يقرب من 15 عامًا من العمل الدؤوب في مجتمع الفنون.
 ميدفورد الفن التعاوني
 عشت هناك لعدة سنوات ونظرت إلى بعض الأماكن.
 هذا مثير للاهتمام للغاية.
 ويسعدني أيضًا أن الفندق يركز بشدة على الاستدامة.
 لذلك لدي سؤالين.
 أولا
 ربما الإجابة الأقصر.
 فيما يتعلق ببناء هذا العقار، لا أرى أي أشجار في الصورة القصيرة المقدمة.
 يميل شارع ميستيك إلى النقص الشديد في المساحات الخضراء وكنت أتساءل عما إذا كان لديك أي خطط للمناظر الطبيعية لمعرفة ما إذا كانت هناك إمكانات هناك أو إذا كنت تخطط لإضافة المساحات الخضراء إلى المنطقة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3066.07s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، شكرا، كين.
 هذا براندون.
 أستطيع الإجابة على هذا السؤال
 بداية أشكرك على دعمك واحترامك للفن.
 أنا ونيك، مؤسسا النظرية، نهتم بشدة بالاستدامة ونقدر فكرة الغطاء الشجري.
 مشروع تنسيق الحدائق الخاص بنا لم ينته بعد، لذلك يمكنني التفكير حقًا
 أعتقد أننا بالتأكيد نريد المزيد.
 أضفه إلى المناظر الطبيعية.
 كما تعلمون، هناك بعض الاعتراضات.
 من وجهة نظر السلامة، لا نريد إيقاف تشغيل كاميراتنا أو أي شيء من هذا القبيل، ولكن قد تستخدم بعض أجزاء الموقع غطاء شجرة لإضافة الظل.
 لذلك أعتقد أن هذه نقطة جيدة.
 والخبر السار هو أننا لم ننتهي من مشروع الحديقة بعد.
 لذلك يمكننا بالتأكيد أن نأخذ ذلك في الاعتبار.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3109.836s">[Krause]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 سؤالي الثاني هو أنني كنت أناقش هذا الأمر مع أشخاص في مجتمع الإنقاذ وهم مهتمون جدًا بالقدرة على دعم مركز الفنون بسهولة وحضور الأحداث هناك وربما يكون لديهم أيضًا استوديو هناك.
 تنبع مخاوفهم من الاعتقاد بأنهم يستطيعون العيش بشكل مريح.
 قم بزيارة الموقع القريب من الصيدلية الموجودة خلفه.
 لقد ذكرت شيئًا عن موقع منفصل تمامًا أعتقد أنه مهم، بالإضافة إلى سياسة صارمة لعدم استخدام هذا الموقع.
 أتساءل عما إذا كان بإمكانك إخبارنا المزيد عن ترتيب المساحة المغلقة وهل هناك مساحة مشتركة؟
 هل هناك مدخل منفصل؟
 هل هناك أي تفاصيل أخرى يمكن أن تساعدنا في فهم كيفية عمل هذين الكيانين بشكل منفصل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3183.104s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: حسنًا، شكرًا، كين.
 هذا سؤال جيد جدا.
 بعض النقاط التي تحتاج إلى إجابة.
 في البداية كانت غرفًا منفصلة تمامًا، قد تكون هناك مساحة تخزين فارغة بينهما، ولكن لم يكن هناك حقًا أي وسيلة للوصول إلى أي مساحة أخرى.
 المدخل أيضًا مستقل تمامًا.
 بالإضافة إلى ذلك، لدينا الآن صيدلية، وبمرور الوقت تعلمنا الضمان حقًا
 يعمل العمل دون وعي مثل متجر بيع بالتجزئة، لذلك قد لا يعرف الشخص العادي ما نقوم به إلا إذا جاء إلينا لشراء الماريجوانا.
 على سبيل المثال، لن ينبعث من المتجر روائح كريهة لأن جميع المنتجات مختومة ومعبأة مسبقًا قبل وصولها إلى الموقع.
 كما تعلمون، ليس لدينا زجاجات عينات كبيرة أو ماريجوانا أو أي شيء من هذا القبيل.
 وبهذا المعنى فهو محترف للغاية وغير مدروس.
 ينطبق هذا أيضًا على خطة موقعنا الإلكتروني.
 لذا فإن مظهر بنايتنا يجعل المكان جميلًا، ولكننا لا نجعل ما نقوم به مبهرجًا.
 الماريجوانا لا تختفي.
 لا توجد أضواء النيون الساطعة.
 إنه محترف للغاية ويقظ.
 إنني أتفهم تمامًا هذه المخاوف، وهي راسخة بالفعل.
 من الأفضل أن نتعاون في الفن
 إذا ظهرت مشكلة، فإننا نناقش بسرعة كيفية حل المشكلة أو نقطة النزاع وتحسينها بحيث يحصل الجميع على أقصى استفادة من الشراكة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3286.031s">[Krause]</a>: شكراً جزيلاً.
 حظ سعيد</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3288.373s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3293.357s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: كل شيء على ما يرام.
 سوف أتأكد من وصول ماي.
 مارك بليك، من فضلك سامحني مرة أخرى على نطقي.
 مرحبا ميج.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3307.686s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: خذ منعطفا.
 نعم، أريد فقط أن أشكرك على تحدثك اليوم.
 هذا مفيد جداً
 سؤالي: لست متأكدا: أين سينمو نبات الماريجوانا؟
 في الملعب أم خارجه؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3331.624s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم، هذا سؤال جيد، ماي.
 شكرا لطرح هذا السؤال.
 لذلك، نحن شركة متكاملة رأسيًا تسمح لنا بالاستفادة من زراعة نباتات الماريجوانا الخاصة بنا.
 لذلك نقوم بذلك في موقعين خارج ميدفورد، ماساتشوستس.
 لذلك لن تزدهر الماريجوانا في ميدفورد.
 لقد نشأنا في منزل.
 لذلك لدينا مزرعة داخلية في بريدجواتر ومزرعة قنب خارجية في شيفيلد، بيركشاير.
 يتم بعد ذلك تجفيف المنتج وفحصه وتعبئته وشحنه إلى الموزعين، ولكن لا يوجد مصنع في الموقع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3373.481s">[May Marquebreuck]</a>: شكرا براندون.
 أريد فقط أن أقول مدى أهمية أن يكون لدى ميدفورد ومجتمع الفنون منزل في النهاية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3385.426s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: شكرا لك
 نحن في انتظار هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3395.974s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: سأضع يديك أسفل.
 إذا كانت لديك أسئلة إضافية، يرجى طرحها مرة أخرى.
 السؤال التالي جيد، لكني أرى لوريل إس. لذا سأخرجك من وضع التنشيط.
 لذلك، لوريل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3409.425s">[Laurel Siegel]</a>: مرحبا
 أنا لوريل سيجل، الرئيس الحالي لجمعية ميدفورد للفنون التعاونية.
 أنا أيضًا رئيس CACHE وأريد فقط التحدث إلى شراكة الفنون إذا أمكنني ذلك.
 ونتيجة لذلك، لدينا أعضاء في مجلس الفنون في ميدفورد CACHE ومدرسة ميدفورد للفنون، بالإضافة إلى أصحاب المصلحة الآخرين في مجتمع الفنون.
 لهذا السبب نقدم ثروة من الخبرة والمعرفة إلى مجتمع الفنون في ميدفورد.
 الشيء الرئيسي الذي أريد قوله هو: أريد الاستفادة من هذه الفرصة، شكرًا لشركة Theory على هذه الفرصة.
 أعتقد أن هذه فرصة عظيمة لمجتمع الفن في ميدفورد.
 أقدر كرمك واحترافيتك في إرسال طلبك إلينا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3458.059s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: شكرا لك، لوريل.
 نحن نقدر دعمك ونتطلع إلى مواصلة العمل معك ومع شركاء الفن الآخرين.
 لذا شكرا مرة أخرى.
 شكرًا لك</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3470.322s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: شكرا لك، لوريل.
 آسف، لقد شممت رائحته للتو.
 ثم لدى كين سؤال آخر.
 سأعيد كين.
 يمين؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3493.12s">[Krause]</a>: شكرا لك
 حسنًا، جاء لي سؤال آخر.
 لم أطلع على دراسة المرور التي ذكرتها.
 ويشمل ذلك حركة الشاحنات داخل وخارج المنطقة، بالإضافة إلى وسائل النقل والإمكانيات الأخرى.
 هل ستتلقى خدمة النقل ذهابًا وإيابًا أم ستفعل ذلك بنفسك تمامًا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3521.245s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: نعم بالتأكيد.
 سؤال جيد حقا، كين.
 كتذكير لمشاهدينا، نعتذر عمومًا عن قولنا إن Medford قد نشرت برنامجًا كاملاً على موقع المدينة الإلكتروني لجميع المتقدمين لمستشفى Medford، بما في ذلك نسخة من خطة التسليم الخاصة بنا.
 ولكن في الغالب
 إجابة النقل هي أننا سنقوم بتسليم مركبة واحدة فقط إلى ميدفورد عدة مرات في الأسبوع.
 لذلك لن يكون لهذا تأثير كبير على حركة المرور.
 هذه هي سيارات فورد ترانزيت.
 هذه ليست 18 عجلات.
 أتمنى لو كنا مشغولين، لكننا لم نتمكن من ذلك.
 ينقلون الماريجوانا مرة أو مرتين في الأسبوع.
 لا تشحن من ميدفورد.
 ولذلك، سيتم تنفيذ التوزيعات الواردة فقط.
 عن طريق الإهمال، وليس خلال ساعات العمل، وفي أي وقت من اليوم.
 ولذلك، فإن نقل عدد قليل من السيارات أسبوعيًا لن يكون له تأثير كبير على تدفق حركة المرور.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3588.006s">[Krause]</a>: حسنا، شكرا لك.
 حاولت تنزيل التطبيق لكن حجمه حوالي 108 ميجابايت.
 لهذا السبب هو ممل جدا.
 إنه كثير جدًا بالنسبة لجهاز الكمبيوتر الصغير الخاص بي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3600.131s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: لا، إنه كبير في السن
 لكننا فكرنا كثيرًا في اقتراحنا.
 أعتقد أن هذه حقًا طريقة للحكم على طول هذه الجملة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3612.856s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: شكرا كين.
 وسوف أقوم بحذف الرابط للمشارك.
 حسنًا، ليس لدي أي أسئلة أخرى في الأسئلة والأجوبة ولا أرى نموًا من ناحية أخرى.
 داني في الوقت المحدد
 داني ليون هل أنت MSO دولي؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3635.709s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: لذلك تعمل علامتنا التجارية Theory Wellness أيضًا في ولاية ماين.
 ومع ذلك، ولأغراض هذا العرض، فإن Theory Wellness Incorporated هي شركة مقرها ماساتشوستس وشركة مقرها ماساتشوستس فقط.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3655.418s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: حسنًا، عظيم.
 هذا حي.
 أوه، أنا أشاهد الأسئلة والأجوبة أيضا.
 أقوم أيضًا بفحص مواضيع المشاركين لمعرفة ما إذا كان أي شخص قد رفع يده.
 لا أستطيع رؤية أي شيء في هذه اللحظة.
 أعتقد أنه سيكون لدينا مكالمتنا الأخيرة.
 معلومات الاتصال متاحة أيضًا في حالة وجود أي أسئلة.
 أنت تعرف ماذا تفكر.
 أعلم أنهم أرسلوا بريدًا إلكترونيًا للاتصال بهم وأنا متأكد من أنهم سيكونون منفتحين على أي محادثة تتم بعد اجتماع اليوم.
 لذا، هل لدى أي شخص مهتم بالدردشة أو الانضمام إلى الدردشة أي أسئلة؟
 شكرا لك
 حصلت على نسخة من كين.
 يسأل كين كراوس: هل يمكنك إخبارنا بالخطوة التالية في عملية الاختيار؟
 أعتقد أن هذا يخص ميدفورد، وليس الولاية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3713.547s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: لدى ميدفورد، بطبيعة الحال، لجنة استشارية للقنب أنشأها العديد من المسؤولين في ميدفورد.
 ويقومون حاليًا بتقييم الاقتراح واختيار ثلاثة مرشحين رئيسيين لتقديم ما يسمى بالاتفاقية الصديقة للمجتمع إلى رئيس البلدية، وهي الخطوة التالية في العملية.
 نحن نفهم أن المناقشة حتى الآن كانت حول أنه سيتم الانتهاء من التوصية بحلول نهاية أغسطس وأن رئيس البلدية قد يتوصل على الفور إلى اتفاق مع المجتمع المضيف.
 إذا كنا محظوظين بما فيه الكفاية ليتم اختيارنا، فيمكننا التقدم بطلب للحصول على ترخيص حكومي، والحصول على تصريح خاص من ZBA، والاستعداد لبناء العيادات ومراكز الفنون.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3772.758s">[SPEAKER_04]</a>: شكرا براندون.
 حسنًا، سأجري المكالمة الأخيرة.
 كتب كين في قسم الأسئلة والأجوبة.
 شكرا لك
 لذا، إذا كان لدى أي شخص أي أسئلة أخرى، فسوف أقوم بتعليق المكالمة الأخيرة لمدة دقيقة تقريبًا.
 لكنني أعتقد الآن أننا نريد فقط أن نشكر كل من استمع أو علق أو طرح أسئلة.
 هذا هو الحوار المجتمعي البناء
 من المهم الحفاظ على الشخصية القوية للمجتمع والحفاظ عليها.
 شكرا للجميع على الوقت الذي أمضيته للانضمام إلينا.
 إذا كانت لديك أسئلة إضافية، يرجى الاتصال بالمرشح على عنوان البريد الإلكتروني المدرج على الشاشة الرئيسية.
 هذا هو مجتمع emorywellness.org.
 أود التحقق مرة أخرى من رابط الأسئلة والأجوبة ورابط العضو لمعرفة ما إذا كان هناك سؤال أخير لم أره هنا.
 شكرا مرة أخرى، براندون.
 سأرسلها لك إذا كنت تريد إزالتها.
 دعنا نقول كلمة أخيرة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001390&t=3832.568s">[4i_C-C_jjiM_SPEAKER_05]</a>: ليس حقا، شكرا جوناثان.
 أشكركم جميعا على اهتمامكم ومشاركتكم في هذا اللقاء.
 نحن نتطلع إلى أن نكون جزءًا من مجتمع ميدفورد هنا.
 نحن نسعى جاهدين لتشغيل صيدلية ذات مستوى عالمي تعود بالنفع على المجتمع بعدة طرق مهمة.
