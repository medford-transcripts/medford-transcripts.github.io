Hassett Drive, Medford, and via Zoom on Tuesday, February 8th, 2022 at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=56.91s">on</a>  a petition from Orville Anabazi of OBE's Auto Service to operate an automotive repair and auto body shop class four license at 38 Harvard Avenue, Medford MA 02155 in a commercial one zoning district. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=69.389s">A</a>  Zoom link for this meeting will be posted no later than February 4th, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=73.633s">Petition</a>  and plan may be seen in the office of the City Clerk, Medford City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=78.918s">Call</a>  781-393-2425 for any accommodations and aids. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=83.502s">TDD</a>  781-393-2516. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=86.344s">The</a>  City of Medford is an equal opportunity employer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=88.366s">By</a>  order of the Medford City Council, Adam Hurtubise, City Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=93.575s">Do</a>  I see Mr. Abbasi? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=96.178s">Is</a>  it here in person? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=97.039s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=98.22s">I</a>  believe where we left this off was there was a question as to whether this was an allowed use under the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=103.846s">And</a>  I believe Councilor Knight has had some communications with city staff regarding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=108.471s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=109.572s">I</a>  think you believe wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=111.254s">I</a>  believe wrong.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=112.195s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=112.736s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=116.409s">Anytime</a>  that a motion's been made on the floor, communication with the city staff should come directly to the council until the individual constantly constantly made the motion right so ultimately, last week I raised the question as to whether or not this is a use that would have to go to our community development boards outline the chapter 94 of our zoning act. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=132.621s">And</a>  I asked the question as to whether or not this is one of those uses because the paper before us didn't say what the use was that we were voting on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=140.527s">So</a>  the question would then come from this council to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=144.129s">The</a>  administration would assign it to a council, to a staff member. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=147.21s">The</a>  staff member would report back to this council via the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=150.091s">I</a>  haven't received any correspondence or communication relative to this subject matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=153.772s">I</a>  don't know if my colleagues have or if the clerk has.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=156.894s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, have you received any correspondence regarding this matter?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=164.777s">I</a>  have not received written correspondence, but I did hear from the solicitor who said that the building commissioner said it will</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=174.145s">Right,</a>  the question was whether or not it wasn't whether it wasn't allowed to use because a special permit right, it was allowed to use special permits before us the question was whether or not to go to the CD board before the council voted on it pursuant to 94. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=185.69s">9481B</a>  of the Zoning Act.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=188.212s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=191.413s">Well,</a>  in that case, Chair of Licensing, do you have a recommendation?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=195.015s">Oh</a>  Chair, still in doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=196.795s">I</a>  think that, you know, is the legal representation, is Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=201.297s">Scanlon</a>  on or? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=202.964s">Mr.</a>  Mulkey on tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=206.045s">Because</a>  unfortunately I hate to hold our petition up again, but it is a valid question that we needed answered for tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=214.967s">I</a>  believe we actually put in the resolution that it was date determined. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=220.729s">It</a>  was, you know, we were pretty strict about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=223.75s">So</a>  we're under the assumption that would the chief of staff know any way to, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=232.515s">find</a>  a way to contact either the city solicitor or Mr. Mulkey to get on the call later on this evening so we don't have to do another night and just table this for later on in the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=242.841s">I'm</a>  comfortable with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=244.141s">Is</a>  that a motion?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=245.022s">If</a>  we can.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=245.502s">They're</a>  not on, they're not on right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=247.123s">The</a>  chief of staff isn't on either? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=248.484s">I</a>  do not see, well the chief of staff isn't on either.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=254.107s">If</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=255.047s">I'm</a>  in total. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=256.408s">Is</a>  there a way to reach out to the city solicitor to see if they can answer that question or?</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=261.537s">I'm</a>  happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=267.458s">One</a>  of them is available to join the meeting this evening.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=269.7s">I'll</a>  do that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=271.421s">I</a>  hate to waste the petitioners another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=274.743s">And</a>  I know that it's a question that's a legitimate question that we need before we move forward.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=280.727s">I'm</a>  genuinely not familiar with the details of the topic, but again, I'm happy to reach out.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=284.25s">We</a>  can, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=285.151s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Schaffer at the table.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=287.932s">At</a>  the table until we get communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=290.694s">So</a>  if you could just ask the petitioner.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=293.717s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=295.698s">To</a>  continue public hearing, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=297.998s">The</a>  motion to continue the public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=299.618s">All</a>  right, just so the petitioner knows, we're just waiting for what we're asking for from the legal department to let us know that we're taking the proper course so that doesn't affect you moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=313.322s">So</a>  we're just waiting for someone if they can call us before the end of the meeting tonight, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=317.203s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=319.315s">All</a>  right, so the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to continue the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=324.48s">We</a>  may take this up again at this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=326.862s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=330.405s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=851.638s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=852.999s">On</a>  section two, I just have a little question with the language on vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=858.782s">If</a>  someone will leave the ward or move out of the city, I would like to see that position filled by, where this is an election, by the person who finished second in the election versus being nominated by the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=873.37s">So</a>  as I say, these people are elected. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=875.7s">And</a>  I say, if that person moves out of the ward or out of the city, I'd just like to see the person who finished second in the election fill that spot, so we can amend it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=887.247s">That's</a>  an amendment from Councilor Caraviello, so that any vacancy on the charter commission would be filled by the person who received the next most votes in the election to that commission.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=896.612s">I</a>  would second that.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=902.516s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=903.216s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=906.784s">First,</a>  I'd like to thank, I know there's a group of residents that are actively taking a role in making sure that this is presented the right way so it's sent to the state in the most positive light moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=929.089s">When</a>  I was first elected, one of my first <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=934.079s">one</a>  of my first initiatives was looking at the charter view and making sure that we could revisit something that we haven't seen in so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=940.804s">So</a>  I think that had changed with me last time we voted, I voted no. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=947.268s">And</a>  the reasons were very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=951.451s">It</a>  was so simple that what was asked for was yes or no and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=958.256s">I</a>  think it's important that as you talk about a commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=962.399s">One</a>  of the biggest things I think needs some debate is the understanding of ward and precinct representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=969.822s">I</a>  think that sounds so easy for everybody and there are definitely some pros in that aspect of making sure that each ward are represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=983.308s">speaking</a>  for myself, working in a municipality in a community that has ward and precinct representation, I see a lot of negative affects of that situation where it becomes a special interest option, special interest groups around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1001.519s">What</a>  I see is a lot of negativity in the sense that you have one community member and one part of the community holding <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1011.636s">their</a>  colleagues hostage in for what they want their initiatives to move forward not what's greater for their community as a whole, but for their small piece of the community and you could, I saw negative effects, a few times that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1027.622s">It</a>  didn't, it didn't help the community, and, and that's because of that and you know some other options that when you know you get a phone call from someone from South Medford or get a phone call from someone from West Medford or someone from the Walton Glenwood area. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1046.548s">I</a>  work just as hard as if it was someone in my own backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1050.252s">So</a>  it gives people the opportunities to call seven different Councilors to really push an initiative, or a concern that they're not following so I see the benefits there I know that there are benefits to go through with it to look at that but again, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1067.348s">when</a>  it was first presented as charter change or charter review, it was cut and dry. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1073.771s">I</a>  had a great discussion with some members of the committee and talking about having a forum where we could discuss these options, where it's more of a thought process that it's discussed, it's understood, and maybe moving forward, it could be something that as you go forward with the initiative, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1095.5s">and</a>  what you're looking for for charter review, at least. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1099.835s">every</a>  piece is broken down and discussed and then thought upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1106.616s">So,</a>  but I do think these, as we move forward with this initiative, I think that I would support it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1116.658s">I</a>  would move forward, I think, but it's also a lot of questions that I think that we should really meet together with the administration and the committee members that are looking to form this commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1129.62s">um</a>  meet in the community the whole meeting and iron out any concerns and issues and then bring this forth with the with the solid base so we can move forward with the vote of seven zero to go to um the state house so we have no issues or concerns because i think that was the biggest thing as we move forward in the past it was unanimous <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1150.126s">support</a>  from a council to the State House saying we all support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1154.007s">And</a>  I think that, you know, making sure that we have all of our questions answered and all of our I's dotted and T's crossed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1163.63s">I</a>  think moving this to a committee of the whole in a relatively short period of time that we can get all the stakeholders in this room to discuss all the questions and then put this forth to a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1176.094s">And</a>  later on they <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1177.814s">next</a>  meeting so we can find a way to move forward in a seven zero vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1182.015s">I</a>  would, I would recommend that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1184.416s">So</a>  that's an emotion.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1185.877s">That's</a>  the motion, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1187.417s">So</a>  motion by Councilor Scarpelli to refer this to committee of the whole seconded by seconded by Councilor Knight, further discussion, President Morell, and then Councilor Knight and then Councilor Collins and Councilor Kelly.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1200.302s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, yeah and I will be brief because as Councilor Scarpelli or someone already noted there's a lot of people here who want to speak on this but I mean, I'm in favor of this I'm also in favor of you know getting that stronger vote I understand that some Councilors have their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1214.925s">I</a>  voted for this in the past I will vote for it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1217.866s">If</a>  nothing else in the fact that this is step one in a review of a document that has not been reviewed in the lifetime of the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1224.967s">of</a>  almost half of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1226.528s">I'm</a>  just on the edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1227.408s">It</a>  has been reviewed in my lifetime by a year, but most of the council are, you know, three members of the council, we have not looked at this document in their lifetime. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1235.911s">So</a>  I think it's just prudent that it's something that is reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1238.492s">And</a>  I think we've seen a lot of good work out of commissions in the city as of late. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1242.553s">And</a>  I think this is something that could have further good work done on it, but I'm also open to getting to that stronger vote so that hopefully the state house can act on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1251.676s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1253.712s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1254.692s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1255.733s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1256.993s">And</a>  looking at section two of this paper that's before us this evening, this proposal, it says the charter commission shall be composed of one commissioner elected from each of the eight wards and one elected at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1267.818s">This</a>  paper also says that this charter review is being brought forward underneath chapter 43B of the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1274.72s">If</a>  we look at section six of chapter 43B of the general laws, it says the charter commission shall consist of nine registered voters of the city or town elected at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1285.461s">So</a>  it sounds to me like we have a conflict of language here right now, Mr. President, with the paper that's before us versus the plain language of the state law that governs charter review.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1297.285s">Is</a>  that a request for anything from the city solicitor regarding that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1307.968s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1310.429s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1314.52s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1317.403s">I'd</a>  support the motion to move this to a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1319.745s">I</a>  think Councilor Scarpelli raises a point that I've heard from multiple sources that, you know, our best chance for passing a home rule petition for charter review is to pass it with unanimous vote from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1331.416s">You</a>  know, respectfully, I hope that we're able to get to seven zero because as, you know, as Councilor Scarpelli, as President Morell already said, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1339.924s">It's</a>  been a long, long time since we've reviewed this foundational code of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1345.891s">I've</a>  heard from a lot of constituents just over the past week about this and a lot more ever since I started campaigning. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1353.0s">I</a>  think this is a really top priority issue for a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1357.23s">who</a>  live in Medford, you know, one raised, I think, you know, perhaps the most salient point of all, which is, you know, any important binding legal document, it's a good idea to review it every once in a while, kind of like we're currently doing with our code of zoning ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1371.619s">To</a>  me, there's simply no reason not to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1374.641s">And,</a>  you know, this home rule petition is just to the question of, do we give Medford an opportunity to review that charter or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1382.026s">it's</a>  not, you know, we're not weighing in on what should come out of that Charter Review Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1386.029s">So,</a>  you know, I hope that we can take steps to give a strong vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1390.973s">And,</a>  you know, I know I'll be voting in favor and excited to present this opportunity to the city.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1396.678s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1397.699s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello then Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1407.298s">I</a>  voted no for this on two other occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1410.281s">The</a>  reason why is because I don't want just a bunch of appointed people to be making decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1420.069s">In</a>  my heart, it's my belief that this should be coming from the people, not the politicians, like it has in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1433.152s">And</a>  the only reason I am supporting it is because of the language that's in there saying that the commission will be elected by the people from each ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1445.595s">And</a>  that was one of my strongest reasons for not voting for it in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1451.64s">If</a>  that language changes to just a bunch of people getting appointed, I don't know if I'll support it in that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1458.244s">But</a>  I will support it in this current fashion that it's in now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1461.827s">But</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1464.502s">This</a>  is, as I say, I am supporting it, but again, this is something that should be coming through signatures, through the people, not us politicians, because they're the real people who are affected by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1476.749s">And</a>  they did it years ago, they went out to get signatures, and they've tried in the past to get signatures, and they weren't able to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1484.633s">I'm</a>  not gonna, you know, in my 10 years on the council here, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1489.349s">I</a>  don't think I've gotten more than a dozen calls about the charter change. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1493.831s">And</a>  though I do agree, it does to be changed and reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1498.133s">I</a>  will say, I will support it in the form it is, as it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1502.974s">I</a>  can't promise I'll support it if the language changes on section two.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1507.516s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1508.317s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1510.017s">I</a>  just wanted to thank all the constituents who've reached out to, at least on my side, who've reached out to me about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1519.804s">I've</a>  gotten more emails on this issue than on any single issue in the past, including during the campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1526.768s">It's</a>  been quite an effort from the people of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1532.311s">You</a>  know, this is an issue which <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1536.534s">I</a>  was asked about when I started running for office from day one, um, you know, is one of one of the, you know, in that town hall it was one of the core issues that people did talk about, um, perhaps slightly to the surprise of a few in the room, but on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1553.667s">you</a>  know, the more the more we campaign, the more we talked to voters, the more it was evident that there are quite a lot of voters who are the who are interested in seeing our city review our charter, and who are interested, especially in the idea of word representation, which does have its own pros and cons, which I think Councilor Scott probably summed up very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1575.227s">It's</a>  in and these are all things that I think <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1578.23s">We</a>  can only truly effectively look at if we have a charter commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1583.212s">It's</a>  just simply the best way the best path forward that we have for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1588.914s">And,</a>  you know, to conduct a charter review in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1593.535s">Um,</a>  this is politically, the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1598.617s">the</a>  best chance that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1601.9s">It's</a>  important to me that we acknowledge that, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1605.262s">Each,</a>  our documents, our laws, our codes, have a life expectancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1610.326s">They</a>  have, you know, they do get old after a period and they do require review. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1615.61s">It</a>  hasn't been reviewed in my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1618.672s">I'm</a>  a little bit young, but hasn't been hasn't been reviewed in the, in the lifetimes of two of my fellow Councilors, and those, and those two Councilors are older than what is usually suggested for the period of review. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1641.752s">Well,</a>  I think it's important that we also note that the Charter Review Commission is our best chance to also look at other foundational aspects of our city regarding who has the power to do one, who has the authority to do what. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1656.784s">This</a>  is something that some residents have talked to me about, and I think it's important to say that tonight as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1663.109s">I'm</a>  happy to support moving this into a committee of the whole and taking the time to really do this right, to really take a, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1670.935s">take</a>  a deep look at this, make sure that everything in here makes sense and that we have the support of everyone on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1677.741s">There's</a>  some decisions that are so important that they do require a lot of support from our council, not just the majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1685.928s">And</a>  I look forward to having that conversation and making sure that we all end up with something that we're happy with.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1695.179s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1696.539s">So</a>  what I have here, if Councilor Caraviello would be so amenable, we have a motion to refer this to Committee of the Whole to meet with the city administration, you know, residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1706.922s">And</a>  Councilor Caraviello, prior to that, you had an amendment to change it to the person who received the next most votes would fill any vacancy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1713.464s">Would</a>  you mind if we discuss that and Councilor Knight's discussion on Chapter 43B at the Committee of the Whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1720.026s">Great,</a>  so that's the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1721.566s">I'm</a>  seeing Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian, and then at this point, seeing no other comments from Councilors, if members of the public would like to line up here or raise their hands on Zoom for comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1731.348s">But</a>  first, Chief of Staff.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1735.109s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, members of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1737.53s">Just</a>  a couple pieces of information for the Council as you go through your process of considering next steps on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1746.132s">Just</a>  wanted to make you aware that this <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1749.212s">This</a>  act was written with consultation with, of course, obviously the mayor was a part of those conversations, with legal counsel, KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1758.937s">So</a>  if this does get referred, which it seems it very well may, to committee of the whole, I would just recommend that the city council schedule a time which could accommodate especially Attorney Lauren Goldberg's time, as well as obviously certain members of the-</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1779.755s">With</a>  all due respect, this council for three years has been beating our chest, screaming and yelling for legal representation, and now we're getting asked to schedule our meetings around the lawyers at KP Law that we haven't been able to meet with for two and a half years.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1791.58s">It's</a>  a little bold. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1793.541s">We</a>  did have them here in our meeting earlier tonight, all due respect, and we are trying to work collaboratively on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1800.044s">So</a>  that's the spirit in which I've been trying to schedule with Council President Morell, anything that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1807.487s">Continue,</a>  Madam Chair.</p>

    <p>[Nazarian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1808.367s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1809.878s">My</a>  comments were not intended to be offensive of any sort. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1813.001s">They're</a>  just pieces of information for the city council to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1816.564s">And</a>  also we do have a couple of constituents who've been assisting with this process, who've been involved in this for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1822.889s">I'm</a>  not sure if Mr. Jim Silva is on the line today, but I know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1827.733s">Milva</a>  McDonald is on the line, and I don't know if they have any specific comments that they'd like to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1832.637s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1833.885s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1834.886s">If</a>  Mr. Carroll's here, if folks who would like to speak, if folks are on Zoom and they would like to speak, if you could please use the raise hand function and I will recognize you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1844.033s">First,</a>  I'll recognize Mr. Carroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1845.294s">If</a>  you could just give us your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1848.837s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1849.858s">Mario</a>  Carroll, 31 Richard Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1852.8s">I</a>  just want to reiterate some of the statements you made today. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1856.183s">I'm</a>  strongly behind shadow review. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1860.706s">It's</a>  been so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1863.456s">that</a>  in review is just what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1866.037s">There's</a>  nothing to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1867.718s">Nothing</a>  says it's gonna be changed, but it's given the citizens of the city an opportunity to review the guidelines that they live by and how their government is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1877.401s">And</a>  so I don't think we're reinventing the wheel with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1880.983s">I</a>  just believe that it's the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1883.264s">The</a>  public has a right to have input in it, have a hand in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1886.525s">I</a>  love the fact that each ward of the city would have representation to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1891.687s">And</a>  as far as I know, home rule is written by by the council to be put into the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1900.409s">So</a>  I think you can put on getting kinds of amendments in there that that's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=1905.29s">But</a>  I just want to let you know, I support it strongly.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2006.136s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell and Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2008.817s">I</a>  just want to speak in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2011.619s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2012.36s">I</a>  missed the beginning of the meeting because I was on the CPC commission meeting speaking in favor of a few projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2019.105s">And</a>  I just wanted to speak in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2022.147s">Charter</a>  review is something that was initially offered in 2016, again in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2028.783s">And</a>  this is the third time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2030.063s">And</a>  I know that Milva, Jim Silva, and a number of residents who are in support of this and who have kind of come together to make sure this moves forward has met with different Councilors that are willing to meet with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2042.708s">And</a>  one issue was the ward representation, which is something we will review in the charter specifically, but when it comes to the advisory commission of nine people, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2057.08s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2057.561s">I</a>  think it's a great idea, and it's something that we made sure KP Law worked with us on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2062.342s">We</a>  were given a few options, and this is the one we picked in hopes to get at least a 6-7, 7-0 vote is our hope, but at least a 6-1 vote because this is being stalled in the statehouse because it's only been a 4-3 vote the last two times. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2077.567s">We</a>  need, my hope would be to move this forward tonight so we can get moving on it, and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2084.221s">something</a>  we can start advocating for tomorrow, but it can be the whole is fine if that's the way you have to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2090.885s">But</a>  I also have to say that KP Law has always, as well as a solicitor, Scanlon has always been willing to meet with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2099.49s">President</a>  Caraviello and I in the past have worked on an agreement and I know that's not the way the council wanted to, you know, move forward over the last several months, but <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2110.453s">we</a>  will always make sure that you get the legal advice you need on all issues, especially the I think 12 ordinances that they're working on now for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2118.658s">So</a>  I just wanted to voice my opinions and let you know I'm fully in favor of this, and I really hope it moves forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2127.223s">It's</a>  something that the city needs that has been it's been over 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2131.726s">We</a>  desperately need this and I will do anything to make sure it gets approved and we follow this path. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2139.211s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2160.469s">You</a>  may need to mute your television. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2169.935s">work</a>  that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2171.855s">I'm</a>  going to go next to Eileen Lerner. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2175.056s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, Eileen.</p>

    <p>[Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2176.916s">Eileen</a>  Lerner, 9 Adams Circle. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2182.157s">I</a>  just wanted to say that I'm strongly in support of this measure for all the reasons that have already been brought forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2190.679s">And</a>  the only thing I have to add really to the discussion is we've <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2197.426s">A</a>  lot of us have been distressed by different people feeling that there's so much division going on in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2209.239s">And</a>  I think if we had a 7-0 vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2213.823s">it</a>  would show that we can come together and we can work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2218.766s">It</a>  would be a great symbol of possible unity in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2224.448s">And</a>  so I just wanna add my strong support for charter review.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2228.551s">Thank</a>  you, Eileen. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2232.753s">Next,</a>  I'm going to go to Steve Schnapp. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2235.094s">Steve,</a>  if you could give us your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Schnapp]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2240.205s">My</a>  name is Steve Schnapp. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2241.326s">I</a>  live at 36 Hillside Ave in Medford Square, lived in Medford since 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2248.712s">I</a>  am on the committee with Milva and others to try and see charter review happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2256.378s">I'll</a>  be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2257.959s">I</a>  want to thank the city councillors for considering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2261.822s">It</a>  seems to me that every single city councillor has voiced support <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2268.342s">for</a>  the notion of a charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2271.043s">So</a>  I'm expecting one way or the other that the city council will come together, will work with the mayor if necessary, and will approve an effort to conduct a charter review and establish a commission, a charter commission, and do whatever it takes to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2295.014s">There</a>  seem to be a number of objections <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2297.972s">some</a>  councils have raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2300.613s">And</a>  I'm sure you will work through them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2305.555s">There</a>  are a great number of people in the city that feel that democracy is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2313.778s">It</a>  is at risk in our nation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2316.919s">And</a>  what we can do to tighten our constitution, so to speak, the charter of the city of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2325.745s">to</a>  enable all citizens to have an opportunity to be heard and to engage in the politics of the city is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2339.035s">And</a>  charter review is a step to making the ability for citizens to be represented and to have an opportunity to give their opinions in the halls of government <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2355.717s">possible.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2357.779s">So</a>  I'm very pleased that all councillors have said they're in support of reviewing the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2364.465s">I</a>  expect you will make it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2366.507s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2368.689s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Schnapp. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2369.83s">I'm</a>  going to go back to Sheila. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2371.491s">We'll</a>  see, see how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2372.773s">Sheila</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Sheila Ehrens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2376.86s">Hi,</a>  this is Sheila Ehrens at 19 Sagamore Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2380.142s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2380.982s">I</a>  have no idea what was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2383.443s">I</a>  just want to just state as other people have that I really support the charter review review. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2389.646s">It's</a>  been many, many years and I think it's really time to take a look at this and have a new roadmap for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2398.61s">So</a>  thank you very much for everybody's attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2401.292s">And</a>  I really appreciate everybody's support.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2405.555s">Thank</a>  you, Sheila. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2406.736s">Next,</a>  we'll go to David Walker. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2408.397s">David,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Walker]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2412.959s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2413.399s">David</a>  Walker, 38 Brookings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2415.4s">I</a>  would just like to quickly add my voice to the chorus of voices supporting charter review, and I hope that this will receive a 7-0 vote in support and we can send it to the state and get moving on this very important measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2426.467s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2428.208s">Thank</a>  you, David. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2430.209s">Any</a>  other members of the public who would like to speak on this topic? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2440.51s">Seeing</a>  none, any other comments from councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2444.401s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2447.098s">I</a>  wanted to thank all the members of the public for coming to speak to us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2451.742s">I</a>  also wanted to note how this Charter Review Commission is a great chance for us to tackle bigger issues as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2462.71s">It's</a>  not a self-contained issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2465.672s">If</a>  you read our city's climate plans, if you read our city's racial justice plans, this is a part of the evolving, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2475.879s">So</a>  stuff like this is a part of that, talking about giving neighborhoods more power, having more local representation to bring up issues on the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2483.622s">This</a>  is all part of that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2485.543s">Communication</a>  with our state delegation, talking to them, it becomes apparent how helpful it is for people to have more local representatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2499.828s">So</a>  those are other reasons why I support this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2503.029s">Thank</a>  y'all for saying there's one more member of the public, Marie Izzo, please give your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Abbasi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2646.045s">This</a>  is an existing license. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2648.006s">Now,</a>  last year, me and Mallet, we got it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2651.087s">Why</a>  I'm not getting it by myself this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2652.688s">I</a>  don't understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2653.809s">Yeah,</a>  I think it's a way that the- But it's an existing business.</p>

    <p>[Abbasi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2673.0s">Do</a>  I have to be Irish or Italian to get this license?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2675.819s">Now</a>  you're out of line right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2676.999s">You're</a>  way out of line. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2678.56s">If</a>  that's what you want, you're voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2679.7s">You</a>  won't win. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2680.48s">I'll</a>  tell you what, you're out of line. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2682.341s">I'm</a>  trying to be kind to have you understand the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2684.882s">This</a>  has nothing about you or race. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2686.882s">For</a>  you to say that, you're out of line, sir.</p>

    <p>[Abbasi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2689.103s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2693.134s">So</a>  I move to continue this until next meeting, have a representative from the law department to answer this question that has something simple to do with the process, has nothing to do with you or the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2708.046s">It</a>  has the process that leaves it in doubt, the way it was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2712.07s">That's</a>  all it was, has nothing to do with the existing permit or anything moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2716.013s">To</a>  tell you the truth, I don't think anybody in this, including the question from the council who asked that we're not going to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2723.819s">We've</a>  always supported our business owners, whether you were Italian or Irish or whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2729.883s">But</a>  I will tell you, there's a question that if we proceed with this, Mr. Abazi, and later we found out we made a mistake, that could affect your business and stop it then. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2739.05s">And</a>  we don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2740.611s">So</a>  that's the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2741.912s">Please.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2751.517s">I</a>  completely understand, but like I said.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2753.459s">It's</a>  not about the license, it's about the process that we need to take as a body to be sure that we're compliant with the law.</p>

    <p>[Abbasi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2776.808s">I'm</a>  doing everything right.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2777.889s">We</a>  know you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2779.99s">We</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2783.212s">No,</a>  we're saying that, listen, when we put this out for you last week, we asked the administration to have that answer to us so we can just let you move forward today. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2791.658s">Unfortunately,</a>  we don't know where that where that dropped and we're going to as a council, we'll look into that because these are the issues we have, we've been fighting with this council to have legal representation at every single night for issues like this because this puts us in a bad way Mr. Bosley, and it's not you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2806.339s">So</a>  and I apologize for. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2809.443s">I</a>  will tell you I understand you want to work but I also don't want to approve something then come down the line that we have to then hold your permit and someone comes in from another department the city and say hey wait a second, you can't proceed, and then that affects your business in a way negative in a manner that will hurt you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2825.675s">more</a>  than you think you're being hurt right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2827.876s">So</a>  I apologize if you think you're being singled out or attacked in any way, but this is just a policy procedure that we have to correct that someone made a mistake on, not you, not you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2839.524s">It's</a>  somebody that should have answered this question and you should have been gone an hour ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2844.847s">Well,</a>  we're gonna we're gonna take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2846.949s">I</a>  will tell you, you don't need to be in next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2848.95s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2849.451s">Council</a>  Council night. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2850.392s">You</a>  don't have to be in next week.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2851.953s">What</a>  we're gonna work to do, Mr. Abbasi, if I may, Councilors, what we're gonna do to work, Mr. Bosley is we're gonna try to get an answer from the city administration to this council by Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2860.12s">When</a>  we have that answer was submitted to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2862.662s">And</a>  when we submit that answer, you will also let you know if it's necessary for you to appear again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2866.465s">Probably,</a>  it seems like this is a technical error. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2869.327s">We</a>  will get that information, we will get the answer that we need, and then we'll tell you, we will vote on it on Tuesday, you don't need to testify, you don't need to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2876.89s">I</a>  apologize for the delay.</p>

    <p>[Abbasi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2878.05s">I</a>  apologize too, it's just that I work so hard, and I like to work in the city, I like the city, and I like you guys, don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2885.173s">It's</a>  just that, why, you know, because it's the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2888.614s">But</a>  I understand, I get it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2889.955s">Yes,</a>  it is the universal discrimination of government, and it's slow processes, and I apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2897.558s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2900.044s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2901.665s">Just</a>  give us your name and address please.</p>

    <p>[Ciarvelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2903.305s">Ciarvelli</a>  52 Mill St, Woburn Mass. I work with Mr. Vazio, I'm one of the managers over at the building, and I just want to say, if he had a little outburst, please excuse his little outburst. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2913.069s">He's</a>  been very stressed out about this, as you can imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2916.05s">And</a>  I've seen it over the course of the last few months, just build and build and build. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2919.411s">So,</a>  not as an excuse or anything, but he is very concerned and very worried about his business.</p>

    <p>[Ciarvelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2929.455s">And</a>  I worked for Mike Fantasia for years in that building as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2932.577s">And</a>  I've just continued employment there.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2934.398s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2934.718s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2934.818s">Have</a>  a good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2935.478s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2936.359s">And</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2940.18s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2941.481s">We</a>  are a motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Councilor Caraviello seconded by. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2952.503s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk on the motion, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2984.244s">Yes,</a>  six in the affirmative one absent motion passes, let me get back to our order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2993.665s">22-064</a>  offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=2995.066s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the acting DPW commissioner report back to the council on whether the salt mix used by the city is pet friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3001.532s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3002.612s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3003.934s">Not</a>  one of my normal resolutions that I put on, but I did get a call from a number of concerned citizens who were out walking their little pups and they had questions and concern as to whether or not the salt mix that the city was using was pet environmentally friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3017.024s">So</a>  with that being said, I said I'll get an answer for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3019.366s">This</a>  is the approach that I'm taking to get such. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3020.967s">So</a>  I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure and hopefully the answer is yes, but thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3027.733s">Very</a>  pessimistic about that being the case.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3030.255s">About</a>  the response or the solvent? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3032.156s">About</a>  the solvent. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3033.117s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by- Mr. President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3039.822s">Yes,</a>  Council President Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3041.598s">Thank</a>  you as I want to thank Councilor Knight my fellow environmentalist for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3046.679s">As</a>  he said this isn't just about pests, it's also about groundwater and aquaculture that can be really impacted by road salt so I also, you know, I don't have too much faith that we're using. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3057.281s">It's</a>  very tricky to get salt that doesn't harm our pets and aquaculture but I think having that information is helpful so I support this motion, I appreciate him bringing it forward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3068.988s">I</a>  personally think the solution should be that we should buy little boots for all the pets, but that's just me. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3081.459s">Any</a>  further discussion on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3087.324s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3090.086s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3092.188s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3104.943s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3107.544s">Yes,</a>  six in the affirmative one absent the motion passes 22-065 offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3113.846s">The</a>  answer was that the Medford City solicitor provided the council with the draft ordinance establishing a youth commission as requested by a vote of the council in April 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3123.068s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3123.909s">Did</a>  you say youth? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3125.109s">Youth,</a>  youth, youth, youth.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3128.49s">Relatively</a>  self explanatory Mr. President, this is a resolution that was put forward and passed by the previous council unanimously seven to nothing in April of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3137.233s">I'm</a>  at that time this council struggling with the effects of the pandemic, we provided a draft resolution to solicitors office and we asked them to craft a resolution that would fit Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3146.817s">The</a>  reason we asked for this was because of the impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3149.418s">that</a>  the pandemic was having on the youth in our community, their ability to interact, the mental health pressures that they're facing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3154.701s">Today,</a>  we still have not seen a draft ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3156.782s">I'm</a>  hoping this is something that we can get in short order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3160.643s">April,</a>  May, June, we're getting there, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3163.305s">It's</a>  almost the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s4ePTNAg4Nw&t=3164.325s">So</a>  with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.</p>
