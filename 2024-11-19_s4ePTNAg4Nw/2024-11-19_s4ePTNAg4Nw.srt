[SPEAKER_10]: Is it here in person?

16
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:37,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Wonderful.

17
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe where we left this off was there was a question as to whether this was an allowed use under the special permit.

18
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:47,530
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe Councilor Knight has had some communications with city staff regarding that.

19
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:48,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

20
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:50,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you believe wrong.

21
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:51,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe wrong.

22
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:52,696
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

23
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:55,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President.

24
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:12,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Anytime that a motion's been made on the floor, communication with the city staff should come directly to the council until the individual constantly constantly made the motion right so ultimately, last week I raised the question as to whether or not this is a use that would have to go to our community development boards outline the chapter 94 of our zoning act.

25
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:20,067
[SPEAKER_11]: And I asked the question as to whether or not this is one of those uses because the paper before us didn't say what the use was that we were voting on.

26
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:24,109
[SPEAKER_11]: So the question would then come from this council to the administration.

27
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,930
[SPEAKER_11]: The administration would assign it to a council, to a staff member.

28
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,711
[SPEAKER_11]: The staff member would report back to this council via the administration.

29
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:33,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't received any correspondence or communication relative to this subject matter.

30
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if my colleagues have or if the clerk has.

31
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:42,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, have you received any correspondence regarding this matter?

32
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:49,579
[SPEAKER_17]: I have not received written correspondence, but I did hear from the solicitor who said that the building commissioner said it will

33
00:02:54,145 --> 00:03:04,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, the question was whether or not it wasn't whether it wasn't allowed to use because a special permit right, it was allowed to use special permits before us the question was whether or not to go to the CD board before the council voted on it pursuant to 94.

34
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,171
[SPEAKER_11]: 9481B of the Zoning Act.

35
00:03:08,212 --> 00:03:11,253
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

36
00:03:11,413 --> 00:03:14,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, in that case, Chair of Licensing, do you have a recommendation?

37
00:03:15,015 --> 00:03:16,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh Chair, still in doubt.

38
00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:21,277
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that, you know, is the legal representation, is Ms.

39
00:03:21,297 --> 00:03:22,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Scanlon on or?

40
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:24,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Mulkey on tonight?

41
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:34,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Because unfortunately I hate to hold our petition up again, but it is a valid question that we needed answered for tonight's meeting.

42
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:40,709
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe we actually put in the resolution that it was date determined.

43
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:43,710
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, you know, we were pretty strict about that.

44
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:51,692
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're under the assumption that would the chief of staff know any way to, you know,

45
00:03:52,515 --> 00:04:02,060
[SPEAKER_16]: find a way to contact either the city solicitor or Mr. Mulkey to get on the call later on this evening so we don't have to do another night and just table this for later on in the meeting.

46
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:03,921
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm comfortable with that.

47
00:04:04,141 --> 00:04:04,722
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a motion?

48
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:05,482
[SPEAKER_16]: If we can.

49
00:04:05,502 --> 00:04:07,043
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not on, they're not on right now.

50
00:04:07,123 --> 00:04:08,464
[SPEAKER_10]: The chief of staff isn't on either?

51
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:14,047
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not see, well the chief of staff isn't on either.

52
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:14,587
[SPEAKER_16]: If we can.

53
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:15,607
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in total.

54
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:20,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a way to reach out to the city solicitor to see if they can answer that question or?

55
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:22,064
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm happy to.

56
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,399
[SPEAKER_29]: One of them is available to join the meeting this evening.

57
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,361
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll do that right now.

58
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:34,703
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate to waste the petitioners another week.

59
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:40,667
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that it's a question that's a legitimate question that we need before we move forward.

60
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:43,970
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm genuinely not familiar with the details of the topic, but again, I'm happy to reach out.

61
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,910
[SPEAKER_16]: We can, thank you.

62
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,872
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Schaffer at the table.

63
00:04:47,932 --> 00:04:50,654
[SPEAKER_16]: At the table until we get communication.

64
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:52,516
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you could just ask the petitioner.

65
00:04:53,717 --> 00:04:53,937
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

66
00:04:55,698 --> 00:04:56,819
[SPEAKER_10]: To continue public hearing, yes.

67
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,558
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion to continue the public hearing.

68
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:12,802
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, just so the petitioner knows, we're just waiting for what we're asking for from the legal department to let us know that we're taking the proper course so that doesn't affect you moving forward.

69
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:17,183
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're just waiting for someone if they can call us before the end of the meeting tonight, okay?

70
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:19,024
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

71
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:24,440
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to continue the public hearing.

72
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,121
[SPEAKER_10]: We may take this up again at this meeting.

86
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:46,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

87
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:47,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President bears.

88
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 permits to the negative.

89
00:05:49,609 --> 00:05:53,010
[SPEAKER_10]: The hearing is continued.

90
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,610
[SPEAKER_10]: 22-063 offered by Council night.

91
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:01,792
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a result of the Medford City Council extended steep and sincere consult condolences to the family of Frank Palmisano on his recent past counselor night.

92
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

93
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:04,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Although I did not know Mr. Palmisano.

94
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:07,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, he was a neighbor of mine grew up around the corner from him.

95
00:06:07,273 --> 00:06:09,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was always a gentleman that was well respected in the neighborhood.

96
00:06:10,274 --> 00:06:12,958
[SPEAKER_11]: If he's anything like his son Carmen, then we know that he's a great man.

97
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:15,101
[SPEAKER_11]: His son Carmen and I have become friends over the years.

98
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:20,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Carmen carries himself as such a gentleman that it's only fitting to say it's a reflection of his father.

99
00:06:21,108 --> 00:06:28,438
[SPEAKER_11]: And recently the city of Medford lost Mr. Parmesano, and I'd like to ask my council colleagues to join me in extending our deep and sincere condolences to the family of a lifelong Metro resident.

100
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:30,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

101
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:36,622
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't mind if you could move the microphone a little closer to your mouth, we're having some issues hearing you with the air.

102
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

103
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:39,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward.

104
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:44,266
[SPEAKER_16]: I honestly, I thought that if he doesn't mind me adding my name to this resolution, I thought I did.

105
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:48,188
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very close friends, graduated with the sun common.

106
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,321
[SPEAKER_16]: and friends with his daughter, Fran.

107
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:53,464
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Palmisano was bigger than life.

108
00:06:53,584 --> 00:07:01,449
[SPEAKER_16]: He was that type of life of the party that worked for years for the Duck Tours and was a legend there.

109
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,493
[SPEAKER_16]: Always a person to make other people laugh and make other people feel comfortable.

110
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:15,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Another member of our community that had a battle of devastating illness and unfortunately,

111
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:25,850
[SPEAKER_16]: passed on that with the major suffering.

112
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:32,114
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's something that, you know, you wish you could take away, but I know that he's not in pain anymore and he's in a better place.

113
00:07:32,854 --> 00:07:43,140
[SPEAKER_16]: And for his family, you know, Method residents who grew up and loved our community and, you know, raised by his wonderful parents.

114
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:49,637
[SPEAKER_16]: their wonderful parents and Mr. Parmigiano was definitely the anchor of that family.

115
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,518
[SPEAKER_16]: So some of that will be missed.

116
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:54,298
[SPEAKER_16]: So I condolences to the Parmigiano family.

117
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:57,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, councilor Scarpelli.

118
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

119
00:07:58,239 --> 00:07:59,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

120
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:08,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Though I didn't know Mr. Parmigiano personally, I am very friendly with the family and I've heard the stories and legendary tales of

121
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:15,155
[SPEAKER_09]: his years on the duck boats and the many friends he's made over this.

122
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:18,757
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, condolences to the family of Mr. Palmazano.

123
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

124
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:24,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further comments from the council or members of the public?

125
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

126
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:34,744
[SPEAKER_10]: It isn't quite yet.

127
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:36,405
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

128
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:38,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Council President.

129
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:43,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm out of breath, having a hard time breathing with this mask.

130
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:49,448
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the most addictive drug in the world, nicotine.

131
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:53,069
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you know that one gram of nicotine would kill an elephant?

132
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,390
[SPEAKER_14]: True story.

133
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,011
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish it never started.

134
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, city councilors.

135
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:09,455
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, congratulations on your re-election to the new, all you councilors who are re-elected and to the new two councilors.

136
00:09:11,747 --> 00:09:18,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I must thank the others who ran for office and caring for Method's future.

137
00:09:19,311 --> 00:09:20,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

138
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:24,154
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry Frank Palmisano was gone.

139
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:29,417
[SPEAKER_14]: I first met him at the Old Method High School in 1965.

140
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:44,111
[SPEAKER_14]: After school, we used to go walk one block to Joe's pool room on the corner of High Street and Forest down the cellar with 10 pool tables.

141
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:52,075
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess we were practicing our geometry, mathematics, as we'd be shot many, many pool balls.

142
00:09:53,416 --> 00:10:02,701
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes we all talked about how we could avoid being drafted into that lousy Vietnam War conflict.

143
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:11,021
[SPEAKER_14]: For you see, in the 60s, we teenagers had real issues to protest and worry about.

144
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:17,066
[SPEAKER_14]: The regime war in Vietnam, or was it a conflict?

145
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:19,588
[SPEAKER_14]: And the draft.

146
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Enough about history.

147
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:33,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I simply want to say, frankly, Frankie was a good boy and a man of good, good character.

148
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:36,893
[SPEAKER_14]: He'll be missed by many.

149
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:43,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing this forward and letting me know about this.

150
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,459
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you all for listening.

151
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:47,580

171
00:12:08,568 --> 00:12:19,396
[SPEAKER_10]: We've taken paper 22 dash 073 which I'll now read 22 dash 073 February 4 2022 by electronic delivery to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council City Hall Medford Massachusetts 02155.

172
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:34,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Regarding Home Rule Petition Charter Commission, dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the following Home Rule Petition and transmit to the General Court for their consideration.

173
00:12:34,732 --> 00:12:36,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

174
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:38,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

175
00:12:38,713 --> 00:12:44,534
[SPEAKER_10]: The Home Rule Petition is the following, an act authorizing the election of a Charter Commission in the City of Medford.

176
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:50,276
[SPEAKER_10]: being enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives and general court assembled and by the authority of the same as follows.

177
00:12:50,916 --> 00:13:12,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Section one, notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 43B of the general laws or any provisions of any general law, special law or regulation to the contrary, the city of Medford City Council shall at the first regular city election or earlier occurring special election held on or after the 60th day following the effective date of this act by order provided for the election of a nine member charter commission.

178
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:19,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Section two, the charter commission shall be composed of one commissioner elected from each of the eight wards of the city and one elected at large.

179
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:29,112
[SPEAKER_10]: In the event a charter commissioner elected to represent a particular ward should move within the city during their term of office, they may continue to serve as the representative from the ward from which they were elected.

180
00:13:29,712 --> 00:13:35,836
[SPEAKER_10]: The vacancy created by any commissioner who moves from the city during their term of office or who resigns may be filled by a majority vote of the entire commission.

181
00:13:36,756 --> 00:13:56,345
[SPEAKER_10]: other than section three other than as set forth here in the provisions of chapter 43b of the general law shall be applicable to the nomination and election of the charter commissioners and to the duties and responsibilities of the city and the charter commission elected here under section four this act shall take effect upon its passage and just to be clear the section two regarding eight

182
00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:08,672
[SPEAKER_10]: one commissioner elected from each of the eight words and one elected at largest for the Charter Commission, not that would not be for anything else just for the Charter Commission, that would be allowed by this whole petition.

183
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:10,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Any counselors?

184
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

185
00:14:11,638 --> 00:14:12,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you.

186
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:17,441
[SPEAKER_09]: On section two, I just have a little question with the language on vacancy.

187
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:32,049
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone will leave the ward or move out of the city, I would like to see that position filled by, where this is an election, by the person who finished second in the election versus being nominated by the group.

188
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,891
[SPEAKER_09]: So as I say, these people are elected.

189
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:46,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And I say, if that person moves out of the ward or out of the city, I'd just like to see the person who finished second in the election fill that spot, so we can amend it.

190
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:56,592
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an amendment from Councilor Caraviello, so that any vacancy on the charter commission would be filled by the person who received the next most votes in the election to that commission.

191
00:14:56,612 --> 00:14:57,533
[SPEAKER_16]: I would second that.

192
00:14:57,573 --> 00:14:59,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

193
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:01,595
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further comments from members of the council?

194
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:03,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

195
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:03,957
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

196
00:15:06,784 --> 00:15:28,449
[SPEAKER_16]: First, I'd like to thank, I know there's a group of residents that are actively taking a role in making sure that this is presented the right way so it's sent to the state in the most positive light moving forward.

197
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:31,830
[SPEAKER_16]: When I was first elected, one of my first

198
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,684
[SPEAKER_16]: one of my first initiatives was looking at the charter view and making sure that we could revisit something that we haven't seen in so many years.

199
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:46,928
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that had changed with me last time we voted, I voted no.

200
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:51,251
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reasons were very simple.

201
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:56,955
[SPEAKER_16]: It was so simple that what was asked for was yes or no and move forward.

202
00:15:58,256 --> 00:16:01,539
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's important that as you talk about a commission,

203
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,762
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the biggest things I think needs some debate is the understanding of ward and precinct representation.

204
00:16:09,822 --> 00:16:21,207
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that sounds so easy for everybody and there are definitely some pros in that aspect of making sure that each ward are represented.

205
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:40,378
[SPEAKER_16]: speaking for myself, working in a municipality in a community that has ward and precinct representation, I see a lot of negative affects of that situation where it becomes a special interest option, special interest groups around the city.

206
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:50,684
[SPEAKER_16]: What I see is a lot of negativity in the sense that you have one community member and one part of the community holding

207
00:16:51,636 --> 00:17:06,482
[SPEAKER_16]: their colleagues hostage in for what they want their initiatives to move forward not what's greater for their community as a whole, but for their small piece of the community and you could, I saw negative effects, a few times that.

208
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:25,648
[SPEAKER_16]: It didn't, it didn't help the community, and, and that's because of that and you know some other options that when you know you get a phone call from someone from South Medford or get a phone call from someone from West Medford or someone from the Walton Glenwood area.

209
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:29,671
[SPEAKER_16]: I work just as hard as if it was someone in my own backyard.

210
00:17:30,252 --> 00:17:46,568
[SPEAKER_16]: So it gives people the opportunities to call seven different counselors to really push an initiative, or a concern that they're not following so I see the benefits there I know that there are benefits to go through with it to look at that but again,

211
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:53,591
[SPEAKER_16]: when it was first presented as charter change or charter review, it was cut and dry.

212
00:17:53,771 --> 00:18:14,999
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a great discussion with some members of the committee and talking about having a forum where we could discuss these options, where it's more of a thought process that it's discussed, it's understood, and maybe moving forward, it could be something that as you go forward with the initiative,

213
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,086
[SPEAKER_16]: and what you're looking for for charter review, at least.

214
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:26,516
[SPEAKER_16]: every piece is broken down and discussed and then thought upon.

215
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:36,198
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but I do think these, as we move forward with this initiative, I think that I would support it now.

216
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:48,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I would move forward, I think, but it's also a lot of questions that I think that we should really meet together with the administration and the committee members that are looking to form this commission.

217
00:18:49,620 --> 00:19:09,066
[SPEAKER_16]: um meet in the community the whole meeting and iron out any concerns and issues and then bring this forth with the with the solid base so we can move forward with the vote of seven zero to go to um the state house so we have no issues or concerns because i think that was the biggest thing as we move forward in the past it was unanimous

218
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:13,987
[SPEAKER_16]: support from a council to the State House saying we all support it.

219
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:23,110
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that, you know, making sure that we have all of our questions answered and all of our I's dotted and T's crossed.

220
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:36,074
[SPEAKER_16]: I think moving this to a committee of the whole in a relatively short period of time that we can get all the stakeholders in this room to discuss all the questions and then put this forth to a vote.

221
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:36,754
[SPEAKER_16]: And later on they

222
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:41,495
[SPEAKER_16]: next meeting so we can find a way to move forward in a seven zero vote.

223
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,176
[SPEAKER_16]: I would, I would recommend that tonight.

224
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,817
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's an emotion.

225
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:46,897
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the motion, please.

226
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:59,201
[SPEAKER_10]: So motion by Councilor Scarpelli to refer this to committee of the whole seconded by seconded by Councilor Knight, further discussion, President Morell, and then Councilor Knight and then Councilor Collins and Councilor Kelly.

227
00:20:00,302 --> 00:20:14,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President, yeah and I will be brief because as Councilor Scarpelli or someone already noted there's a lot of people here who want to speak on this but I mean, I'm in favor of this I'm also in favor of you know getting that stronger vote I understand that some counselors have their concerns.

228
00:20:14,925 --> 00:20:17,025
[SPEAKER_22]: I voted for this in the past I will vote for it again.

229
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:23,987
[SPEAKER_22]: If nothing else in the fact that this is step one in a review of a document that has not been reviewed in the lifetime of the most.

230
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:26,368
[SPEAKER_22]: of almost half of this council.

231
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:27,388
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just on the edge.

232
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:35,851
[SPEAKER_22]: It has been reviewed in my lifetime by a year, but most of the council are, you know, three members of the council, we have not looked at this document in their lifetime.

233
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,471
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think it's just prudent that it's something that is reviewed.

234
00:20:38,492 --> 00:20:42,233
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think we've seen a lot of good work out of commissions in the city as of late.

235
00:20:42,553 --> 00:20:51,236
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think this is something that could have further good work done on it, but I'm also open to getting to that stronger vote so that hopefully the state house can act on this.

236
00:20:51,676 --> 00:20:51,976
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

237
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:54,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Morell.

238
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:55,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

239
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:56,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

240
00:20:56,993 --> 00:21:06,917
[SPEAKER_11]: And looking at section two of this paper that's before us this evening, this proposal, it says the charter commission shall be composed of one commissioner elected from each of the eight wards and one elected at large.

241
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:14,000
[SPEAKER_11]: This paper also says that this charter review is being brought forward underneath chapter 43B of the general laws.

242
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:23,264
[SPEAKER_11]: If we look at section six of chapter 43B of the general laws, it says the charter commission shall consist of nine registered voters of the city or town elected at large.

243
00:21:25,461 --> 00:21:34,284
[SPEAKER_11]: So it sounds to me like we have a conflict of language here right now, Mr. President, with the paper that's before us versus the plain language of the state law that governs charter review.

244
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:41,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that a request for anything from the city solicitor regarding that?

245
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:49,188
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

246
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:51,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

247
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,321
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

248
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,665
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd support the motion to move this to a committee of the whole.

249
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:10,836
[SPEAKER_28]: I think Councilor Scarpelli raises a point that I've heard from multiple sources that, you know, our best chance for passing a home rule petition for charter review is to pass it with unanimous vote from the council.

250
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:18,543
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, respectfully, I hope that we're able to get to seven zero because as, you know, as Councilor Scarpelli, as President Morell already said,

251
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:25,831
[SPEAKER_28]: It's been a long, long time since we've reviewed this foundational code of our city.

252
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:32,980
[SPEAKER_28]: I've heard from a lot of constituents just over the past week about this and a lot more ever since I started campaigning.

253
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,404
[SPEAKER_28]: I think this is a really top priority issue for a lot of people.

254
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:50,739
[SPEAKER_28]: who live in Medford, you know, one raised, I think, you know, perhaps the most salient point of all, which is, you know, any important binding legal document, it's a good idea to review it every once in a while, kind of like we're currently doing with our code of zoning ordinances.

255
00:22:51,619 --> 00:22:54,541
[SPEAKER_28]: To me, there's simply no reason not to do it.

256
00:22:54,641 --> 00:23:01,326
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, this home rule petition is just to the question of, do we give Medford an opportunity to review that charter or not?

257
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:05,929
[SPEAKER_28]: it's not, you know, we're not weighing in on what should come out of that Charter Review Commission.

258
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:10,873
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know, I hope that we can take steps to give a strong vote on this.

259
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:15,717
[SPEAKER_28]: And, you know, I know I'll be voting in favor and excited to present this opportunity to the city.

260
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:17,599
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

261
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:19,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello then Councilor Tseng.

262
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:29,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I voted no for this on two other occasions.

263
00:23:30,281 --> 00:23:39,449
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why is because I don't want just a bunch of appointed people to be making decisions.

264
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:51,159
[SPEAKER_09]: In my heart, it's my belief that this should be coming from the people, not the politicians, like it has in the past.

265
00:23:53,152 --> 00:24:04,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only reason I am supporting it is because of the language that's in there saying that the commission will be elected by the people from each ward.

266
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:11,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was one of my strongest reasons for not voting for it in the past.

267
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,824
[SPEAKER_09]: If that language changes to just a bunch of people getting appointed, I don't know if I'll support it in that point.

268
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:21,807
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will support it in this current fashion that it's in now.

269
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:22,147
[SPEAKER_09]: But again,

270
00:24:24,502 --> 00:24:36,669
[SPEAKER_09]: This is, as I say, I am supporting it, but again, this is something that should be coming through signatures, through the people, not us politicians, because they're the real people who are affected by this.

271
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:44,012
[SPEAKER_09]: And they did it years ago, they went out to get signatures, and they've tried in the past to get signatures, and they weren't able to get them.

272
00:24:44,633 --> 00:24:48,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not gonna, you know, in my 10 years on the council here,

273
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:53,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I've gotten more than a dozen calls about the charter change.

274
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:56,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And though I do agree, it does to be changed and reviewed.

275
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:01,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say, I will support it in the form it is, as it is right now.

276
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:06,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't promise I'll support it if the language changes on section two.

277
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:08,297
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

278
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:08,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng.

279
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:19,343
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to thank all the constituents who've reached out to, at least on my side, who've reached out to me about this issue.

280
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:26,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I've gotten more emails on this issue than on any single issue in the past, including during the campaign.

281
00:25:26,768 --> 00:25:30,790
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been quite an effort from the people of our city.

282
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,213
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this is an issue which

283
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:53,107
[SPEAKER_06]: I was asked about when I started running for office from day one, um, you know, is one of one of the, you know, in that town hall it was one of the core issues that people did talk about, um, perhaps slightly to the surprise of a few in the room, but on it.

284
00:25:53,667 --> 00:26:14,026
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the more the more we campaign, the more we talked to voters, the more it was evident that there are quite a lot of voters who are the who are interested in seeing our city review our charter, and who are interested, especially in the idea of word representation, which does have its own pros and cons, which I think Councilor Scott probably summed up very well.

285
00:26:15,227 --> 00:26:17,770
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in and these are all things that I think

286
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,332
[SPEAKER_06]: We can only truly effectively look at if we have a charter commission.

287
00:26:23,212 --> 00:26:28,894
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just simply the best way the best path forward that we have for our city.

288
00:26:28,914 --> 00:26:33,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, to conduct a charter review in this way.

289
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:37,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, this is politically, the most.

290
00:26:38,617 --> 00:26:40,058
[SPEAKER_06]: the best chance that we have.

291
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,602
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to me that we acknowledge that, right?

292
00:26:45,262 --> 00:26:50,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Each, our documents, our laws, our codes, have a life expectancy.

293
00:26:50,326 --> 00:26:55,590
[SPEAKER_06]: They have, you know, they do get old after a period and they do require review.

294
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,032
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't been reviewed in my life.

295
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:13,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little bit young, but hasn't been hasn't been reviewed in the, in the lifetimes of two of my fellow counselors, and those, and those two counselors are older than what is usually suggested for the period of review.

296
00:27:21,752 --> 00:27:35,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think it's important that we also note that the Charter Review Commission is our best chance to also look at other foundational aspects of our city regarding who has the power to do one, who has the authority to do what.

297
00:27:36,784 --> 00:27:42,248
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that some residents have talked to me about, and I think it's important to say that tonight as well.

298
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:49,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to support moving this into a committee of the whole and taking the time to really do this right, to really take a,

299
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:57,281
[SPEAKER_06]: take a deep look at this, make sure that everything in here makes sense and that we have the support of everyone on here.

300
00:27:57,741 --> 00:28:05,728
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some decisions that are so important that they do require a lot of support from our council, not just the majority vote.

301
00:28:05,928 --> 00:28:13,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And I look forward to having that conversation and making sure that we all end up with something that we're happy with.

302
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

303
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:25,962
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I have here, if Councilor Caraviello would be so amenable, we have a motion to refer this to Committee of the Whole to meet with the city administration, you know, residents.

304
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:33,424
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilor Caraviello, prior to that, you had an amendment to change it to the person who received the next most votes would fill any vacancy.

305
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:39,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you mind if we discuss that and Councilor Knight's discussion on Chapter 43B at the Committee of the Whole?

306
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:41,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, so that's the motion.

307
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:51,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm seeing Chief of Staff Nina Nazarian, and then at this point, seeing no other comments from Councilors, if members of the public would like to line up here or raise their hands on Zoom for comment.

308
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:52,629
[SPEAKER_10]: But first, Chief of Staff.

309
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,130
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the Council.

310
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:04,091
[SPEAKER_29]: Just a couple pieces of information for the Council as you go through your process of considering next steps on this.

311
00:29:06,132 --> 00:29:07,692
[SPEAKER_29]: Just wanted to make you aware that this

312
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:18,737
[SPEAKER_29]: This act was written with consultation with, of course, obviously the mayor was a part of those conversations, with legal counsel, KP Law.

313
00:29:18,937 --> 00:29:35,565
[SPEAKER_29]: So if this does get referred, which it seems it very well may, to committee of the whole, I would just recommend that the city council schedule a time which could accommodate especially Attorney Lauren Goldberg's time, as well as obviously certain members of the-

314
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:50,120
[SPEAKER_11]: With all due respect, this council for three years has been beating our chest, screaming and yelling for legal representation, and now we're getting asked to schedule our meetings around the lawyers at KP Law that we haven't been able to meet with for two and a half years.

315
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,340
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little bold.

316
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:58,623
[SPEAKER_10]: We did have them here in our meeting earlier tonight, all due respect, and we are trying to work collaboratively on this.

317
00:30:00,044 --> 00:30:06,387
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the spirit in which I've been trying to schedule with Council President Morell, anything that we're doing.

318
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:08,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Continue, Madam Chair.

319
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:09,148
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Mr. President.

320
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:12,981
[SPEAKER_29]: My comments were not intended to be offensive of any sort.

321
00:30:13,001 --> 00:30:15,843
[SPEAKER_29]: They're just pieces of information for the city council to consider.

322
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:22,849
[SPEAKER_29]: And also we do have a couple of constituents who've been assisting with this process, who've been involved in this for quite some time.

323
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:27,513
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not sure if Mr. Jim Silva is on the line today, but I know Ms.

324
00:30:27,733 --> 00:30:32,157
[SPEAKER_29]: Milva McDonald is on the line, and I don't know if they have any specific comments that they'd like to make.

325
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:33,198
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you very much.

326
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:34,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

327
00:30:34,886 --> 00:30:43,653
[SPEAKER_10]: If Mr. Carroll's here, if folks who would like to speak, if folks are on Zoom and they would like to speak, if you could please use the raise hand function and I will recognize you.

328
00:30:44,033 --> 00:30:45,274
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I'll recognize Mr. Carroll.

329
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:47,296
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could just give us your name and address for the record, please.

330
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:49,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

331
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:52,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario Carroll, 31 Richard Street, Medford.

332
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to reiterate some of the statements you made today.

333
00:30:56,183 --> 00:31:00,306
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm strongly behind shadow review.

334
00:31:00,706 --> 00:31:02,467
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been so many years.

335
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:05,857
[SPEAKER_08]: that in review is just what it is.

336
00:31:06,037 --> 00:31:07,678
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing to be changed.

337
00:31:07,718 --> 00:31:17,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing says it's gonna be changed, but it's given the citizens of the city an opportunity to review the guidelines that they live by and how their government is.

338
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:20,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't think we're reinventing the wheel with this thing.

339
00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:23,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I just believe that it's the way to go.

340
00:31:23,264 --> 00:31:26,445
[SPEAKER_08]: The public has a right to have input in it, have a hand in it.

341
00:31:26,525 --> 00:31:30,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the fact that each ward of the city would have representation to it.

342
00:31:31,687 --> 00:31:39,289
[SPEAKER_08]: And as far as I know, home rule is written by by the council to be put into the state house.

343
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:44,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think you can put on getting kinds of amendments in there that that's possible.

344
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,331
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just want to let you know, I support it strongly.

345
00:31:48,331 --> 00:31:49,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Carroll.

346
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:53,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Milva McDonald, I'll unmute your name and address for the record, please.

347
00:31:57,489 --> 00:32:01,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street, West Medford.

348
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:08,578
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I'd just like to thank the council for considering this.

349
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:09,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also strongly in favor.

350
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:20,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to thank the council members who took the time to speak with me and a group of other residents that really has been working to try to get this to happen.

351
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:23,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caraviello.

352
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:46,347
[SPEAKER_01]: As others have said, I would just be repeating, it's been a very long time since the charter has been reviewed, and this petition is just to elect a commission to look at the charter, and it will be a long, transparent process that will get the residents involved in thinking about

353
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Our charter is basically the roadmap.

354
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:54,385
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the constitution of our city and it really needs to be reviewed.

355
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:58,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thank you for taking the time and attention to look at it.

356
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:02,171
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to continue to be involved.

357
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:07,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a group of people who really support this and want this.

358
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:08,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

359
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Milva.

360
00:33:12,901 --> 00:33:15,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other comments from members of the public?

361
00:33:19,551 --> 00:33:21,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I see Madam Mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

362
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:28,797
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Morell and Bears.

363
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:31,559
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to speak in favor.

364
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:32,320
[SPEAKER_23]: I apologize.

365
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:39,025
[SPEAKER_23]: I missed the beginning of the meeting because I was on the CPC commission meeting speaking in favor of a few projects.

366
00:33:39,105 --> 00:33:41,526
[SPEAKER_23]: And I just wanted to speak in favor of this.

367
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:45,969
[SPEAKER_23]: Charter review is something that was initially offered in 2016, again in 2020.

368
00:33:48,783 --> 00:33:49,923
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is the third time.

369
00:33:50,063 --> 00:34:02,608
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know that Milva, Jim Silva, and a number of residents who are in support of this and who have kind of come together to make sure this moves forward has met with different counselors that are willing to meet with them.

370
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:14,132
[SPEAKER_23]: And one issue was the ward representation, which is something we will review in the charter specifically, but when it comes to the advisory commission of nine people,

371
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,541
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree.

372
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:22,222
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's a great idea, and it's something that we made sure KP Law worked with us on.

373
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:37,467
[SPEAKER_23]: We were given a few options, and this is the one we picked in hopes to get at least a 6-7, 7-0 vote is our hope, but at least a 6-1 vote because this is being stalled in the statehouse because it's only been a 4-3 vote the last two times.

374
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:43,409
[SPEAKER_23]: We need, my hope would be to move this forward tonight so we can get moving on it, and I think

375
00:34:44,221 --> 00:34:50,605
[SPEAKER_23]: something we can start advocating for tomorrow, but it can be the whole is fine if that's the way you have to go.

376
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:58,730
[SPEAKER_23]: But I also have to say that KP Law has always, as well as a solicitor, Scanlon has always been willing to meet with this council.

377
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:08,776
[SPEAKER_23]: President Caraviello and I in the past have worked on an agreement and I know that's not the way the council wanted to, you know, move forward over the last several months, but

378
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:18,258
[SPEAKER_23]: we will always make sure that you get the legal advice you need on all issues, especially the I think 12 ordinances that they're working on now for you.

379
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:27,183
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just wanted to voice my opinions and let you know I'm fully in favor of this, and I really hope it moves forward.

380
00:35:27,223 --> 00:35:31,206
[SPEAKER_23]: It's something that the city needs that has been it's been over 30 years.

381
00:35:31,726 --> 00:35:38,751
[SPEAKER_23]: We desperately need this and I will do anything to make sure it gets approved and we follow this path.

382
00:35:39,211 --> 00:35:39,471
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

383
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:41,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

384
00:35:41,618 --> 00:35:42,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Sheila.

385
00:35:42,818 --> 00:35:45,820
[SPEAKER_10]: I will unmute you if you could give us your name and your address for the record.

386
00:35:56,827 --> 00:35:57,967
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess I'm muted.

387
00:35:58,287 --> 00:35:59,308
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry about that.

388
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:04,171
[SPEAKER_10]: You may need to mute your television.

389
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:10,495
[SPEAKER_10]: work that out.

390
00:36:11,855 --> 00:36:13,496
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go next to Eileen Lerner.

391
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:16,896
[SPEAKER_10]: Name and address for the record, please, Eileen.

392
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:20,497
[SPEAKER_25]: Eileen Lerner, 9 Adams Circle.

393
00:36:22,157 --> 00:36:29,419
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to say that I'm strongly in support of this measure for all the reasons that have already been brought forth.

394
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:36,360
[SPEAKER_25]: And the only thing I have to add really to the discussion is we've

395
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:48,498
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of us have been distressed by different people feeling that there's so much division going on in Medford.

396
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:50,901
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think if we had a 7-0 vote,

397
00:36:53,823 --> 00:36:58,746
[SPEAKER_25]: it would show that we can come together and we can work together.

398
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:03,648
[SPEAKER_25]: It would be a great symbol of possible unity in the city.

399
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:08,530
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I just wanna add my strong support for charter review.

400
00:37:08,551 --> 00:37:12,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Eileen.

401
00:37:12,753 --> 00:37:15,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, I'm going to go to Steve Schnapp.

402
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:17,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Steve, if you could give us your name and address for the record.

403
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,266
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

404
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:27,050
[SPEAKER_26]: I live at 36 Hillside Ave in Medford Square, lived in Medford since 2010.

405
00:37:28,712 --> 00:37:34,937
[SPEAKER_26]: I am on the committee with Milva and others to try and see charter review happen.

406
00:37:36,378 --> 00:37:37,279
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll be very brief.

407
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:41,582
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to thank the city councillors for considering this.

408
00:37:41,822 --> 00:37:47,707
[SPEAKER_26]: It seems to me that every single city councillor has voiced support

409
00:37:48,342 --> 00:37:50,243
[SPEAKER_26]: for the notion of a charter review.

410
00:37:51,043 --> 00:38:14,914
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm expecting one way or the other that the city council will come together, will work with the mayor if necessary, and will approve an effort to conduct a charter review and establish a commission, a charter commission, and do whatever it takes to do that.

411
00:38:15,014 --> 00:38:16,855
[SPEAKER_26]: There seem to be a number of objections

412
00:38:17,972 --> 00:38:19,212
[SPEAKER_26]: some councils have raised.

413
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:25,135
[SPEAKER_26]: And I'm sure you will work through them.

414
00:38:25,555 --> 00:38:32,077
[SPEAKER_26]: There are a great number of people in the city that feel that democracy is important.

415
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,039
[SPEAKER_26]: It is at risk in our nation right now.

416
00:38:36,919 --> 00:38:45,002
[SPEAKER_26]: And what we can do to tighten our constitution, so to speak, the charter of the city of Medford,

417
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:58,334
[SPEAKER_26]: to enable all citizens to have an opportunity to be heard and to engage in the politics of the city is important.

418
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:15,107
[SPEAKER_26]: And charter review is a step to making the ability for citizens to be represented and to have an opportunity to give their opinions in the halls of government

419
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:16,177
[SPEAKER_26]: possible.

420
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:24,005
[SPEAKER_26]: So I'm very pleased that all councillors have said they're in support of reviewing the charter.

421
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,147
[SPEAKER_26]: I expect you will make it happen.

422
00:39:26,507 --> 00:39:27,208
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

423
00:39:28,689 --> 00:39:29,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Schnapp.

424
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to go back to Sheila.

425
00:39:31,491 --> 00:39:32,733
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll see, see how it works.

426
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:35,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Sheila name and address for the record, please.

427
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:39,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, this is Sheila Ehrens at 19 Sagamore Park.

428
00:39:40,142 --> 00:39:40,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.

429
00:39:40,982 --> 00:39:42,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what was going on.

430
00:39:43,443 --> 00:39:49,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to just state as other people have that I really support the charter review review.

431
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:58,050
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been many, many years and I think it's really time to take a look at this and have a new roadmap for our city.

432
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:00,992
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much for everybody's attention.

433
00:40:01,292 --> 00:40:03,973
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate everybody's support.

434
00:40:05,555 --> 00:40:06,476
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Sheila.

435
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:08,337
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, we'll go to David Walker.

436
00:40:08,397 --> 00:40:10,438
[SPEAKER_10]: David, name and address for the record, please.

437
00:40:12,959 --> 00:40:13,319
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

438
00:40:13,399 --> 00:40:15,240
[SPEAKER_27]: David Walker, 38 Brookings Street.

439
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:26,126
[SPEAKER_27]: I would just like to quickly add my voice to the chorus of voices supporting charter review, and I hope that this will receive a 7-0 vote in support and we can send it to the state and get moving on this very important measure.

440
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:27,047
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you very much.

441
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:28,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, David.

442
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:32,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other members of the public who would like to speak on this topic?

443
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing none, any other comments from councilors?

444
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Sviggum.

445
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:51,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to thank all the members of the public for coming to speak to us tonight.

446
00:40:51,742 --> 00:41:01,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanted to note how this Charter Review Commission is a great chance for us to tackle bigger issues as well.

447
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a self-contained issue.

448
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:15,099
[SPEAKER_06]: If you read our city's climate plans, if you read our city's racial justice plans, this is a part of the evolving, you know,

449
00:41:15,879 --> 00:41:23,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So stuff like this is a part of that, talking about giving neighborhoods more power, having more local representation to bring up issues on the local level.

450
00:41:23,622 --> 00:41:24,863
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all part of that as well.

451
00:41:25,543 --> 00:41:39,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Communication with our state delegation, talking to them, it becomes apparent how helpful it is for people to have more local representatives.

452
00:41:39,828 --> 00:41:41,949
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are other reasons why I support this.

453
00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:48,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank y'all for saying there's one more member of the public, Marie Izzo, please give your name and address for the record.

454
00:41:50,868 --> 00:41:54,470
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, Marie Izzo, 29 Pilgrim Road, Medford, Mass.

455
00:41:55,330 --> 00:42:02,313
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm a delegate for Ward 8 and I have yet to meet my ward colleagues.

456
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:07,155
[SPEAKER_24]: I've yet to meet one person that was against charter review.

457
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:11,397
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanna share that because that feels to me like that is a majority.

458
00:42:11,497 --> 00:42:14,679
[SPEAKER_24]: I've spoken to several members on and on.

459
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,420
[SPEAKER_24]: It's been years of this conversation.

460
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,520
[SPEAKER_24]: So my hope is that,

461
00:42:20,282 --> 00:42:25,070
[SPEAKER_24]: The city council takes this very seriously and unanimously votes for the review.

462
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:25,611
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

463
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:47,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing no other public comment, the motion on the floor from Councilor Scarpelli to refer this to Committee of the Whole, where we will discuss the question of how vacancies will be replaced, as well as any conflicts with Chapter 43B of Massachusetts General Law.

464
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:51,495
[SPEAKER_10]: That motion to send to Committee of the Whole by Councilor Scarpelli is seconded by Councilor Knight.

465
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:54,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

466
00:42:56,759 --> 00:42:57,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello?

467
00:42:57,579 --> 00:42:57,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

468
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins?

469
00:42:59,441 --> 00:42:59,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

470
00:43:00,558 --> 00:43:01,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

471
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:01,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

472
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

473
00:43:03,221 --> 00:43:03,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

474
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:04,963
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

475
00:43:05,063 --> 00:43:05,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

476
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:06,464
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morell.

477
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:07,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

478
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:09,487
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

479
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:09,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

480
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:12,751
[SPEAKER_10]: 70 from a zero to negative that item is referred to committee of the whole.

481
00:43:14,753 --> 00:43:19,117
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that Milwaukee is advising me.

482
00:43:19,738 --> 00:43:22,661
[SPEAKER_17]: I know they try to reach out to the city solicitor.

483
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:27,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, they're tied up with the family situation right now.

484
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:30,688
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't wanna waste, I don't wanna have you sitting here wasting the rest of your evening.

485
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:48,600
[SPEAKER_16]: If we can ask the clerk to have the answer reported back to the council and have someone from the city solicitor's office on the meeting for next week so we can get this taken care of and the answer that Councilor Knight can move forward.

486
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,601
[SPEAKER_16]: You can come forward if you want.

487
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:50,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

488
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:53,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, right.

489
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:54,572
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, yep.

490
00:43:54,752 --> 00:43:55,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, yep.

491
00:43:55,113 --> 00:43:59,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Abbasi, name and address for the record.

492
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:04,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

493
00:44:04,964 --> 00:44:05,585
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a question.

494
00:44:05,745 --> 00:44:05,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

495
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:07,286
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an existing license.

496
00:44:08,006 --> 00:44:11,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, last year, me and Mallet, we got it together.

497
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:12,668
[SPEAKER_15]: Why I'm not getting it by myself this year?

498
00:44:12,688 --> 00:44:13,629
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't understand this.

499
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:16,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think it's a way that the- But it's an existing business.

500
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:29,937
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, but it's a way that the permit process, the way it goes through, it has to be asked the proper way, and the way that it was asked leaves doubt, and not anything that you did, it was- I mean, I'm just an immigrant from Albania coming to work.

501
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:31,217
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, I know, and we wanna-

502
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:33,000
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't, we don't want...

502
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I have to be Irish or Italian to get this license?

503
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:36,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Now you're out of line right now.

504
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:37,980
[SPEAKER_16]: You're way out of line.

505
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,660
[SPEAKER_16]: If that's what you want, you're voting.

506
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,400
[SPEAKER_16]: You won't win.

507
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,261
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll tell you what, you're out of line.

508
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:44,621
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying to be kind to have you understand the process.

509
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:46,862
[SPEAKER_16]: This has nothing about you or race.

510
00:44:46,882 --> 00:44:49,083
[SPEAKER_16]: For you to say that, you're out of line, sir.

511
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:49,863
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

512
00:44:53,134 --> 00:45:07,986
[SPEAKER_16]: So I move to continue this until next meeting, have a representative from the law department to answer this question that has something simple to do with the process, has nothing to do with you or the permit.

513
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:11,689
[SPEAKER_16]: It has the process that leaves it in doubt, the way it was presented.

514
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,292
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all it was, has nothing to do with the existing permit or anything moving forward.

515
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:23,098
[SPEAKER_16]: To tell you the truth, I don't think anybody in this, including the question from the council who asked that we're not going to support this.

516
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:29,483
[SPEAKER_16]: We've always supported our business owners, whether you were Italian or Irish or whatnot.

517
00:45:29,883 --> 00:45:38,950
[SPEAKER_16]: But I will tell you, there's a question that if we proceed with this, Mr. Abazi, and later we found out we made a mistake, that could affect your business and stop it then.

518
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:39,831
[SPEAKER_16]: And we don't want that.

519
00:45:40,611 --> 00:45:41,612
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the reason why.

520
00:45:41,912 --> 00:45:42,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Please.

521
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:43,273
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

522
00:45:44,952 --> 00:45:48,935
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an existing license valid even now, half of the license from last year.

523
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,437
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why it's kind of confusing, you know?

524
00:45:51,517 --> 00:45:53,439
[SPEAKER_16]: I completely understand, but like I said.

525
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:57,963
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not about the license, it's about the process that we need to take as a body to be sure that we're compliant with the law.

526
00:45:57,983 --> 00:46:00,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Just if I may, I understand your frustration.

527
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:03,447
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a process issue.

528
00:46:04,648 --> 00:46:06,430
[SPEAKER_10]: We believe it's on our end internally.

529
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:06,950
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not you.

530
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:08,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing to do with you at all.

531
00:46:09,272 --> 00:46:11,354
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this council, you know,

532
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:16,788
[SPEAKER_10]: We're gonna, we're gonna move this forward legally as quickly as we possibly can.

533
00:46:16,808 --> 00:46:17,709
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm doing everything right.

534
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:19,330
[SPEAKER_16]: We know you are.

535
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,092
[SPEAKER_16]: We understand.

536
00:46:23,212 --> 00:46:30,998
[SPEAKER_16]: No, we're saying that, listen, when we put this out for you last week, we asked the administration to have that answer to us so we can just let you move forward today.

537
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:45,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, we don't know where that where that dropped and we're going to as a council, we'll look into that because these are the issues we have, we've been fighting with this council to have legal representation at every single night for issues like this because this puts us in a bad way Mr. Bosley, and it's not you.

538
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:47,761
[SPEAKER_16]: So and I apologize for.

539
00:46:49,443 --> 00:47:04,703
[SPEAKER_16]: I will tell you I understand you want to work but I also don't want to approve something then come down the line that we have to then hold your permit and someone comes in from another department the city and say hey wait a second, you can't proceed, and then that affects your business in a way negative in a manner that will hurt you.

540
00:47:05,675 --> 00:47:07,836
[SPEAKER_16]: more than you think you're being hurt right now.

541
00:47:07,876 --> 00:47:19,424
[SPEAKER_16]: So I apologize if you think you're being singled out or attacked in any way, but this is just a policy procedure that we have to correct that someone made a mistake on, not you, not you.

542
00:47:19,524 --> 00:47:24,507
[SPEAKER_16]: It's somebody that should have answered this question and you should have been gone an hour ago.

543
00:47:24,847 --> 00:47:26,629
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we're gonna we're gonna take care of it.

544
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:28,450
[SPEAKER_16]: I will tell you, you don't need to be in next week.

545
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:29,311
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

546
00:47:29,451 --> 00:47:30,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Council night.

547
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:31,893
[SPEAKER_16]: You don't have to be in next week.

548
00:47:31,953 --> 00:47:39,479
[SPEAKER_10]: What we're gonna work to do, Mr. Abbasi, if I may, counselors, what we're gonna do to work, Mr. Bosley is we're gonna try to get an answer from the city administration to this council by Friday.

549
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,141
[SPEAKER_10]: When we have that answer was submitted to you.

550
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:46,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we submit that answer, you will also let you know if it's necessary for you to appear again.

551
00:47:46,465 --> 00:47:48,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably, it seems like this is a technical error.

552
00:47:49,327 --> 00:47:56,630
[SPEAKER_10]: We will get that information, we will get the answer that we need, and then we'll tell you, we will vote on it on Tuesday, you don't need to testify, you don't need to be here.

553
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize for the delay.

554
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:04,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I apologize too, it's just that I work so hard, and I like to work in the city, I like the city, and I like you guys, don't get me wrong.

555
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:08,594
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just that, why, you know, because it's the same.

556
00:48:08,614 --> 00:48:09,935
[SPEAKER_15]: But I understand, I get it.

557
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:16,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is the universal discrimination of government, and it's slow processes, and I apologize for that.

558
00:48:17,558 --> 00:48:17,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

559
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:20,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

560
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Just give us your name and address please.

561
00:48:23,305 --> 00:48:32,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Ciarvelli 52 Mill St, Woburn Mass. I work with Mr. Vazio, I'm one of the managers over at the building, and I just want to say, if he had a little outburst, please excuse his little outburst.

562
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:36,010
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been very stressed out about this, as you can imagine.

563
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:39,391
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've seen it over the course of the last few months, just build and build and build.

564
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:43,853
[SPEAKER_13]: So, not as an excuse or anything, but he is very concerned and very worried about his business.

565
00:48:44,013 --> 00:48:44,773
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to be friends.

566
00:48:44,813 --> 00:48:47,154
[SPEAKER_10]: We understand this is life and death to people.

567
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,135
[SPEAKER_10]: This is about their daily lives and their ability to work.

568
00:48:49,175 --> 00:48:49,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, sir.

569
00:48:49,455 --> 00:48:52,557
[SPEAKER_13]: And I worked for Mike Fantasia for years in that building as well.

570
00:48:52,577 --> 00:48:54,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've just continued employment there.

571
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:54,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

572
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:54,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

573
00:48:54,818 --> 00:48:55,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a good evening.

574
00:48:55,478 --> 00:48:55,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

575
00:48:56,359 --> 00:48:57,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you.

576
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor right now?

577
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:08,244
[SPEAKER_10]: We are a motion to revert back to the regular order of business by Councilor Caraviello seconded by.

578
00:49:12,503 --> 00:49:16,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk on the motion, please call the roll.

579
00:49:22,129 --> 00:49:22,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

580
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:22,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

581
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:22,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

582
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:23,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

583
00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:23,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

584
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:49,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, six in the affirmative one absent motion passes, let me get back to our order of business.

585
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:55,026
[SPEAKER_10]: 22-064 offered by Councilor Knight.

586
00:49:55,066 --> 00:50:01,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it so resolved that the acting DPW commissioner report back to the council on whether the salt mix used by the city is pet friendly.

587
00:50:01,532 --> 00:50:02,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

588
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:03,873
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

589
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:16,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Not one of my normal resolutions that I put on, but I did get a call from a number of concerned citizens who were out walking their little pups and they had questions and concern as to whether or not the salt mix that the city was using was pet environmentally friendly.

590
00:50:17,024 --> 00:50:19,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I said I'll get an answer for them.

591
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:20,827
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the approach that I'm taking to get such.

592
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:27,713
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure and hopefully the answer is yes, but thank you.

593
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Very pessimistic about that being the case.

594
00:50:30,255 --> 00:50:32,036
[SPEAKER_10]: About the response or the solvent?

595
00:50:32,156 --> 00:50:32,897
[SPEAKER_10]: About the solvent.

596
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:38,941
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by- Mr. President, if I could.

597
00:50:39,822 --> 00:50:40,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Council President Morell.

598
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:46,219
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you as I want to thank Councilor Knight my fellow environmentalist for bringing this forward.

599
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:56,641
[SPEAKER_22]: As he said this isn't just about pests, it's also about groundwater and aquaculture that can be really impacted by road salt so I also, you know, I don't have too much faith that we're using.

600
00:50:57,281 --> 00:51:06,723
[SPEAKER_22]: It's very tricky to get salt that doesn't harm our pets and aquaculture but I think having that information is helpful so I support this motion, I appreciate him bringing it forward.

601
00:51:08,988 --> 00:51:13,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally think the solution should be that we should buy little boots for all the pets, but that's just me.

602
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:23,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion on the motion?

603
00:51:27,324 --> 00:51:29,626
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Collins.

604
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,247
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

605
00:51:32,188 --> 00:51:32,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

606
00:51:44,943 --> 00:51:45,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

607
00:51:47,544 --> 00:51:53,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, six in the affirmative one absent the motion passes 22-065 offered by Councilor Knight.

608
00:51:53,846 --> 00:52:02,988
[SPEAKER_10]: The answer was that the Medford City solicitor provided the council with the draft ordinance establishing a youth commission as requested by a vote of the council in April 2021.

609
00:52:03,068 --> 00:52:03,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

610
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:04,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say youth?

611
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:07,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Youth, youth, youth, youth.

612
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:15,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Relatively self explanatory Mr. President, this is a resolution that was put forward and passed by the previous council unanimously seven to nothing in April of 2021.

613
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:26,797
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm at that time this council struggling with the effects of the pandemic, we provided a draft resolution to solicitors office and we asked them to craft a resolution that would fit Medford.

614
00:52:26,817 --> 00:52:28,878
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason we asked for this was because of the impacts.

615
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:34,000
[SPEAKER_11]: that the pandemic was having on the youth in our community, their ability to interact, the mental health pressures that they're facing.

616
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:36,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Today, we still have not seen a draft ordinance.

617
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:39,463
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm hoping this is something that we can get in short order, Mr. President.

618
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:43,285
[SPEAKER_11]: April, May, June, we're getting there, you know what I mean?

619
00:52:43,305 --> 00:52:44,305
[SPEAKER_11]: It's almost the year.

620
00:52:44,325 --> 00:52:46,706
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

621
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:47,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

622
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:48,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

623
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:49,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Tseng.

624
00:52:49,568 --> 00:52:53,610
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to thank my fellow youth councilor here.

625
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:56,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Young environmentalist.

626
00:52:56,871 --> 00:52:58,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, young environmentalist.

627
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:00,600
[SPEAKER_06]: for bringing this forward.

628
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:06,964
[SPEAKER_06]: This is certainly a close issue that's close to my heart, being someone who is young and in the city.

629
00:53:07,564 --> 00:53:14,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I strongly believe that for our democracy to be healthy and strong we need to be addressing the issues that young people care about.

630
00:53:15,149 --> 00:53:18,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to give young people stake in our country in our city as well.

631
00:53:18,831 --> 00:53:21,413
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm totally support this and thank you.

632
00:53:23,134 --> 00:53:25,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng any further discussion.

633
00:53:26,374 --> 00:53:31,417
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

634
00:53:31,437 --> 00:53:35,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello?

635
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:36,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

636
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,120
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins?

637
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:37,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

638
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:38,401
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight?

639
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:38,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

640
00:53:39,021 --> 00:53:39,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli?

641
00:53:42,143 --> 00:53:43,224
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the Youth Commission.

642
00:53:43,444 --> 00:53:43,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yes.

643
00:53:45,665 --> 00:53:46,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Strange?

644
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:46,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

645
00:53:47,006 --> 00:53:47,626
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morell?

646
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:48,567
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

647
00:53:49,968 --> 00:53:50,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Ferriero?

648
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:50,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

649
00:53:50,919 --> 00:54:05,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 from resume the negative the motion passes 22 dash 066 offered by President morale, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request that the administration deploy temporary signage as needed, noting so emergency parking procedures throughout the city, President morale.

650
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:26,656
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President, yeah this is pretty self explanatory I had a few residents reach out to me with some confusion about the most recent storm as far as parking procedures I do know that the city goes through great effort with our reverse 911 to put out calls about snow emergencies there is information on the website but people moving from other communities that do have signage around this.

651
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:42,875
[SPEAKER_22]: Sometimes they're at a loss they don't see signs saying they can't park on the side of their street and then their car is gone so I know other communities Somerville specifically puts out some temporary signage simple yard signs around the city indicating what side of the street to park on if your street is under a snow emergency.

652
00:54:43,799 --> 00:55:04,665
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we've had success in our city with simple signage as far as around elections information that we haven't done in the past so just see if this is something the administration will consider so that we can reach those residents who might not know how to get city alerts, they might be new to the city and not understand city policies and they would like to not have their car, remove surprisingly during a snowstorm so I move approval.

653
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:09,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President morale, any further discussion, Councilor Caraviello.

654
00:55:10,981 --> 00:55:11,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

655
00:55:11,682 --> 00:55:14,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Council Member Raul, for putting this forward.

656
00:55:15,665 --> 00:55:19,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, you know, our city suffers from sign pollution right now.

657
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:23,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we've got signs everywhere and everywhere.

658
00:55:23,125 --> 00:55:24,426
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just, there's so many signs.

659
00:55:24,506 --> 00:55:25,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I said, we can't even keep up with all those signs.

660
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know where we can put more signs in the city.

661
00:55:29,931 --> 00:55:35,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the city goes through as many lengths, you get a reverse 911, you get a text.

662
00:55:35,716 --> 00:55:41,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know how much more the city can do to tell you when it's a snow emergency.

663
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:44,844
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, usually, I mean, unless you're living in a bubble,

664
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:51,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you're here, when Boston, the Cousins, and everyone else, usually Method is right behind it.

665
00:55:52,229 --> 00:55:58,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So, again, I don't know where we're going to put this temporary signage amongst the thousands of signs.

666
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:01,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if anyone's driven down High Street or anything, or Yale Street.

667
00:56:01,997 --> 00:56:02,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Signs everywhere.

668
00:56:03,578 --> 00:56:06,020
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know where we can put any more signs.

669
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand where the President is coming from.

670
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:19,455
[SPEAKER_09]: If I say, I don't know what people want from the city, other than, you know, let's say that you get, there's so many messages that all went into Snowbird.

671
00:56:19,495 --> 00:56:19,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's say so.

672
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:21,459
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President, if I could.

673
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:34,473
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just the thought I mean, I think in Somerville it's literally, you know, they'll have a yard sign, like a lawn sign and like a rotary, you know, a city owned property that just indicates, it's just a suggestion for the administration.

674
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:43,336
[SPEAKER_22]: There are you know I did, I did hear from people that somehow they don't, they don't, the information did not reach them, their car was towed, something you know we could look into potentially.

675
00:56:43,356 --> 00:56:49,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Any further discussion.

676
00:56:49,778 --> 00:56:50,738
[SPEAKER_16]: I can Mr. President.

677
00:56:54,354 --> 00:57:04,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said, I worked the storm in Somerville, and I think that I'm one of the first people people talk to when their cars are being towed and ticketed.

678
00:57:04,817 --> 00:57:10,819
[SPEAKER_16]: So as an administrator there, that's one of my duties while the administrators are on the road working.

679
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:16,041
[SPEAKER_16]: And the signage you're talking about really is put in place after the storms.

680
00:57:16,761 --> 00:57:21,468
[SPEAKER_16]: when they're going to remove the snow mounds up and down the street, the snow emergency.

681
00:57:22,229 --> 00:57:33,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of them luckily has the blinking lights at all the all the the storm alerts that are all the blinking lights, all the street lights that are blinking white light that

682
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:37,089
[SPEAKER_16]: That calls for snow emergency for people to look at what's going on.

683
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:39,792
[SPEAKER_16]: They do a reverse 911.

684
00:57:40,613 --> 00:57:42,875
[SPEAKER_16]: They do a, an email blast.

685
00:57:43,376 --> 00:57:49,302
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the last thing they do before they get told is actually the police officers actually traverse the streets with the

686
00:57:50,003 --> 00:57:52,585
[SPEAKER_16]: with the tow trucks saying, please move your cars.

687
00:57:53,405 --> 00:57:54,546
[SPEAKER_16]: It's under snow emergency.

688
00:57:54,586 --> 00:58:02,491
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that, but I think having the signs out there, if there's a way to keep it, I think that poses a couple of different concerns.

689
00:58:03,072 --> 00:58:16,201
[SPEAKER_16]: One that we're going to have DPW workers that are going to possibly working, if it's a big storm like that, that are going to be possibly working 24 to 36 hours and having them go out hours early to put up signs or hours after to put up signs.

690
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:19,623
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that it really takes away from what we really need them to be doing.

691
00:58:20,984 --> 00:58:35,675
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that, you know, maybe working with the communications department to find a way to reach those citizens that reach out to you, that are not getting the notifications.

692
00:58:36,155 --> 00:58:43,721
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I think the signs might, I don't think they'll work in our community for that fact.

693
00:58:43,801 --> 00:58:47,284
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't think we have the manpower to actually

694
00:58:48,271 --> 00:58:54,999
[SPEAKER_16]: put those signs out and then if you're talking big snow, they're probably covered within an hour anyway.

695
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:00,105
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just think that there is a way that, you know,

696
00:59:01,192 --> 00:59:13,419
[SPEAKER_16]: doing reverse 911 letting everybody know that there's a snow emergency, and what the policy is and which side to park on posting it on on public access television on the loop.

697
00:59:13,939 --> 00:59:19,723
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, you know, sending out city wide emails that that people that aren't on that.

698
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:24,424
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think a lot of people that don't get notifications, it's just because they haven't been.

699
00:59:25,264 --> 00:59:35,987
[SPEAKER_16]: They haven't been put on the list with communications and we've had thousands of people asked me, and all they really need to do is contact communications department and have their names and phone numbers added to that list.

700
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:39,668
[SPEAKER_16]: So that if there is a snow emergency, they'll get taxpayer.

701
00:59:41,872 --> 00:59:48,735
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, one of the biggest things I have, being that I work in Somerville, I get the same notifications that residents get in Somerville.

702
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:56,398
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll get an email, I'll get a robo call, and I'll get a text message, you know, throughout the day before a snow emergency.

703
00:59:56,518 --> 01:00:01,060
[SPEAKER_16]: Once a snow emergency is gonna be declared, letting me know, and I live in Medford.

704
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,661
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't think this is a difficult ask.

705
01:00:03,781 --> 01:00:09,663
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think that it should be, you know, maybe a little coordinated with the communications director moving forward.

706
01:00:09,703 --> 01:00:10,964
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, a little winded,

707
01:00:11,704 --> 01:00:12,024
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

708
01:00:12,244 --> 01:00:13,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for bringing it forward, though.

709
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:19,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Just before we go to Councilor Collins, I just want to add, you can actually fill out a form on the city website to automatically sign up for those alerts.

710
01:00:20,088 --> 01:00:20,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

711
01:00:22,128 --> 01:00:24,210
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you and thank you President we're all we're putting this forward.

712
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:31,637
[SPEAKER_28]: I want to concur with a lot of counselors have really just said, I also just want to note I think that this is a problem that's felt differently in different neighborhoods.

713
01:00:32,317 --> 01:00:35,660
[SPEAKER_28]: I live in South Medford renter most people on my street are renters.

714
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:43,428
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that this is a very I think that you know the parking enforcement during snowstorms is felt really differently like depending on the character of a neighborhood.

715
01:00:44,228 --> 01:00:50,556
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of my neighbors did not move their cars because they had no idea that we're having a snow emergency.

716
01:00:51,037 --> 01:00:59,668
[SPEAKER_28]: I've had people reaching out to me on Twitter to ask about parking policies and I think if people are reaching out to little old me on Twitter it's because they have no idea where to look for that information.

717
01:01:00,689 --> 01:01:09,476
[SPEAKER_28]: I can sympathize because as a digital native almost, as a millennial, I struggled a couple of years ago to find where to sign up for city alerts.

718
01:01:09,516 --> 01:01:13,740
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm probably about as plugged into city stuff as anybody in my age group.

719
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:28,192
[SPEAKER_28]: So I agree, I think this should be coordinated with other citywide communications because I think the need for signage, and I do think there are some neighborhoods where it would be kind of the only thing that people see about it, shows that we have a pretty big communication gap.

720
01:01:29,173 --> 01:01:30,676
[SPEAKER_28]: in our city for alerts like this in general.

721
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:49,495
[SPEAKER_16]: but maybe looking at the portable digital sign posted in strategic areas that don't really get the information they need.

722
01:01:49,535 --> 01:01:54,379
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think the sign itself, I just don't see that working.

723
01:01:55,800 --> 01:02:00,083
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I agree with you, every which way we can to help to get the word out.

724
01:02:00,103 --> 01:02:04,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just as one councillor, this language is pretty open.

725
01:02:05,226 --> 01:02:09,509
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually thinking when this was going up, it would be more like when we had the Craddock Bridge project,

726
01:02:10,672 --> 01:02:14,957
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the traffic sign that said go here, go there, go everywhere for a while.

727
01:02:14,977 --> 01:02:23,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And in addition, you know, we have these super boards and major squares, those could go up, those are, you know, tall and generally at least most of the time over the height of the

728
01:02:24,403 --> 01:02:26,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know, the billboards as well.

729
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:32,167
[SPEAKER_10]: So, cause I do, I do think there's a gap where new residents, you know, don't know the procedures of the rules.

730
01:02:32,187 --> 01:02:37,409
[SPEAKER_10]: And the real issue that I've seen is that, you know, we have a lot of signage on most of our streets.

731
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,331
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not one of the things that's signed on those streets.

732
01:02:40,391 --> 01:02:45,073
[SPEAKER_10]: So if someone parks on the street, then they look up at the sign next to their street, this isn't on there.

733
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:49,235
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of, you know, and I'm not saying we should go replace 10,000 signs on every block.

734
01:02:49,255 --> 01:02:51,116
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause we know that what kind of project that would be.

735
01:02:51,676 --> 01:02:59,300
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we get some temporary solutions in, and then maybe as well, going forward, if we're redoing a street, look at the signage on that street.

736
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:00,800
[SPEAKER_10]: That might help.

737
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng.

738
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:06,143
[SPEAKER_06]: From what I'm hearing, I think everyone is bringing up good points.

739
01:03:06,963 --> 01:03:10,345
[SPEAKER_06]: There are accessibility problems, and then we can look to other cities.

740
01:03:10,425 --> 01:03:16,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we have to think about how spread out our resources are, especially during a snow emergency as well.

741
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:19,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps it would be good to amend this

742
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:29,563
[SPEAKER_06]: by asking the city administration just generally explore temporary and permanent solutions for addressing communication gaps during snow emergencies.

743
01:03:29,944 --> 01:03:33,369
[SPEAKER_06]: That way we can also kind of explore options outside of just signage.

744
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:54,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, temporarily, generally explore temporary and permanent solutions to close communication gaps regarding snow emergencies.

745
01:03:57,757 --> 01:03:59,758
[SPEAKER_10]: President Morales that amendment acceptable.

746
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:02,260
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, that'd be great.

747
01:04:07,283 --> 01:04:09,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion, if I may, Mr. President.

748
01:04:09,504 --> 01:04:11,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'd like to make a public service announcement.

749
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:15,898
[SPEAKER_11]: There's gonna be two feet of snow, there's gonna be a snow emergency, all right?

750
01:04:16,178 --> 01:04:18,679
[SPEAKER_11]: So, temporary signs, we don't need them.

751
01:04:18,699 --> 01:04:21,460
[SPEAKER_11]: If two feet of snow is coming, we're gonna be in a snow emergency.

752
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:24,600
[SPEAKER_11]: That goes without saying.

753
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:26,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a riddle for you, Councilor Knight.

754
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:29,882
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's December 2020, is it even parking lot?

755
01:04:30,142 --> 01:04:32,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Even, December, even.

756
01:04:32,563 --> 01:04:32,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it?

757
01:04:33,103 --> 01:04:35,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, winter starts in December, man.

758
01:04:35,164 --> 01:04:36,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't you live here?

759
01:04:37,004 --> 01:04:37,744
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on a DCR.

760
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:38,464
[SPEAKER_10]: I live on a DCR.

761
01:04:40,987 --> 01:04:45,410
[SPEAKER_11]: But ultimately, there's one thing I think that a lot of people don't do anymore.

762
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:49,593
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's this crazy thing, they pick up the phone and they call somebody and they ask a question, right?

763
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Like call the police department and say, is it a snow emergency?

764
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:54,917
[SPEAKER_11]: And what side of the street am I supposed to park on, right?

765
01:04:54,997 --> 01:04:59,260
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people are afraid to pick up the phone these days and call, but we have great resources here in the city of Medford.

766
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,361
[SPEAKER_11]: The police department staff 24 hours a day.

767
01:05:01,401 --> 01:05:06,025
[SPEAKER_11]: We have somebody at the police department that's in dispatch that could always answer a question if anybody has a question about where I went to park.

768
01:05:06,565 --> 01:05:07,546
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also have the night watch.

769
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:12,910
[SPEAKER_11]: The night watchman in the DPW is also available to address questions and concerns like that.

770
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:19,636
[SPEAKER_11]: So there are resources out there for individuals in this community that have questions about where to park during snow emergencies.

771
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:23,460
[SPEAKER_11]: The DPWs during snow emergencies is operating 24 hours a day.

772
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,623
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's always someone that's available to answer a call and answer a question.

773
01:05:27,163 --> 01:05:31,167
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I hope that the individuals out there in the community that are having such difficulty

774
01:05:32,088 --> 01:05:38,832
[SPEAKER_11]: figuring out where to park, also take advantage of some of these old fashioned resources, like not signing up for alerts, but picking up the phone and asking the question.

775
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:40,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that get you the same answer?

776
01:05:42,014 --> 01:05:42,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

777
01:05:42,994 --> 01:05:48,798
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, if anyone from DCR is listening, please turn your plows to the left on Fells Way West.

778
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,140
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going east on Fells Way West, turn your plows to the left.

779
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,602
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, just right between 621 and 629, that would be.

780
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:56,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello?

781
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it looks like Miss Catalo.

782
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:12,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, Mr. Castagnetti first, then we'll go to Miss Catalo.

783
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:13,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Castagnetti.

784
01:06:14,953 --> 01:06:15,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr.

785
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,091
[SPEAKER_14]: President Andrew, for me, Smith, I'll be very brief.

786
01:06:19,491 --> 01:06:21,472
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell brings up some good points.

787
01:06:22,852 --> 01:06:30,595
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't want anyone to get told, unless they're in front of my driveway, or they're causing problems near where I have to navigate with my vehicles.

788
01:06:31,275 --> 01:06:42,619
[SPEAKER_14]: On the other hand, signage, as Councilor Cabello stated, that we get enough signs, it's more than sign pollution, it's sign confusion also.

789
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And the ex-chief,

790
01:06:45,447 --> 01:06:50,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Leo Sacco used to say, we have too many signs in this city.

791
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:51,371
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to add any more.

792
01:06:53,312 --> 01:06:57,674
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess the song says, signs, signs, everywhere is signs.

793
01:06:58,034 --> 01:06:59,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't do this, don't do that.

794
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't you read the sign?

795
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:02,217
[SPEAKER_14]: However, we need solutions.

796
01:07:02,537 --> 01:07:10,982
[SPEAKER_14]: You already have a field that worked, it worked for me and some of my neighbors, and actually there were absentee owner tenants.

797
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:13,804
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was impressed that they paid attention.

798
01:07:14,841 --> 01:07:19,143
[SPEAKER_14]: being absentee tenants, so to speak.

799
01:07:19,544 --> 01:07:24,126
[SPEAKER_14]: So you do the reverse 9-1-1, and I guess you do an email, I understand, this evening.

800
01:07:24,867 --> 01:07:30,250
[SPEAKER_14]: The only other solution I can come up with is maybe get a Times Square billboard in the middle of the square.

801
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:34,412
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's still never gonna satisfy all the people at any time.

802
01:07:35,373 --> 01:07:36,153
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish you good luck.

803
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,976
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Cassidetti.

804
01:07:41,056 --> 01:07:43,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Kelly Catala, name and address for the record, please.

805
01:07:43,869 --> 01:07:47,090
[SPEAKER_12]: LA Catalo 46 Otis Street in Medford.

806
01:07:47,911 --> 01:07:57,674
[SPEAKER_12]: President Morell, I totally understand what you're saying about the signs, but this community had a big upheaval about seven or eight years ago because there were signs on every corner.

807
01:07:57,694 --> 01:08:00,755
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was a huge push to get rid of a lot of signs.

808
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:05,697
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so many signs in Medford Square that people don't know which way to go.

809
01:08:05,857 --> 01:08:07,678
[SPEAKER_12]: And at some point they all become blind.

810
01:08:08,178 --> 01:08:15,541
[SPEAKER_12]: I know myself as a realtor in the community I'm really, you know, cognizant about telling people, make sure you sign up for the reverse 911.

811
01:08:16,162 --> 01:08:20,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I know the city has their new welcome to Medford program maybe there could be more outreach on that.

812
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:34,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it could go on the literature that gets delivered to every household in regards to the trash and the recycling and the calendar, maybe it could go there on, but I don't think adding more science is going to help.

813
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:50,563
[SPEAKER_12]: People will always say well I didn't see the sign, if you if you care to know something then you find out every community has a reverse 911, so it doesn't matter what city they go to, they're being told, you should go to the city website and you should register for the 911.

814
01:08:51,984 --> 01:08:57,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully that will help and there's always going to be something that somebody is going to want for another sign.

815
01:08:57,891 --> 01:09:08,422
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's at some point there, it was just too much we're so overrun with them so I personally would like to see better communication and other venues, and a lot less signs.

816
01:09:08,522 --> 01:09:08,842
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

817
01:09:16,196 --> 01:09:23,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Seeing no further discussion on the motion of President Morell, seconded by Councilor Tseng, as amended by Councilor Tseng.

818
01:09:24,139 --> 01:09:25,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

819
01:09:45,747 --> 01:10:02,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 from the negative the motion passes 22 dash 067 offer by President morale being so resolved that the Medford City Council send a letter to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission chair Kathy Judd Stein calling for the rejection of the proposed 1800 seat entertainment venue connection to the on court casino President morale.

820
01:10:03,302 --> 01:10:04,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

821
01:10:04,622 --> 01:10:12,725
[SPEAKER_22]: Since I submitted this encore has since walked back their proposal for this entertainment venue they are looking at a less than 1000 seat venue.

822
01:10:13,525 --> 01:10:26,069
[SPEAKER_22]: But as since Councilor Caraviello brought this forward to the, I believe Councilor Caraviello or he's been doing work on this brought this forward to the council encore has changed their plans a number of times so I do think there is still merit to sending a letter.

823
01:10:27,649 --> 01:10:31,051
[SPEAKER_22]: resident Ken Krause who's also been working on this mentioned that we do.

824
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:47,220
[SPEAKER_22]: He supports us coming out and just basically stating that the city of Medford or the council rather is against when presenting live entertainment anywhere within its gaming establishment unless they're under 1000 seats or over 300 3500 seats.

825
01:10:47,621 --> 01:10:53,984
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, the reason for this is this would be anything outside of this would be in direct violation of the community.

826
01:10:56,065 --> 01:11:15,311
[SPEAKER_22]: surrounding community agreement that was entered into so just stating as a council and going in line with the administration who sent a similar letter that we are against any proposed entertainment venue that would violate the terms that we that were agreed to many years ago as far as the number of seats and would do harm to local smaller venues such as the Chevalier.

827
01:11:17,415 --> 01:11:18,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Morell.

828
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:19,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

829
01:11:19,598 --> 01:11:20,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

830
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:22,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Morell, for bringing this forward.

831
01:11:22,663 --> 01:11:26,468
[SPEAKER_09]: As you said, this has been changed to a 1,000-seat arena.

832
01:11:26,969 --> 01:11:31,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Kinga for the great service she did in today's paper in regards to this.

833
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:33,298
[SPEAKER_09]: But the fact still remains the same.

834
01:11:34,019 --> 01:11:42,666
[SPEAKER_09]: they're still putting in a venue to do entertainment, along with the 3,800 seat ballroom that they've used in the past for entertainment.

835
01:11:42,686 --> 01:11:47,790
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, this is nothing but another backdoor way of getting entertainment into the building.

836
01:11:48,231 --> 01:11:57,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, Medford, Lynn, Cabot, all these small venues all vow for the same entertainers.

837
01:11:58,299 --> 01:12:02,322
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, they don't have the deep pockets

838
01:12:03,308 --> 01:12:13,695
[SPEAKER_09]: that Encore has to hire somebody for an exorbitant price and pay them that, that we can't afford to, because they'll make up the shortfall on the gaming.

839
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:18,959
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, the playing field still isn't level for this.

840
01:12:19,019 --> 01:12:31,007
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I've reached out to our whole delegation on this, and I know they've all spoken to the gaming commission on this.

841
01:12:33,103 --> 01:12:49,269
[SPEAKER_09]: But like I say, at the end of the day, all it is is another backdoor attempt to bring entertainment into their building under the guise of giving it away for free to the players.

842
01:12:49,609 --> 01:12:59,313
[SPEAKER_09]: And like we saw last time, when they used that conveniently, all the tickets were up for sale on Ticketmaster for shows that were supposedly for free.

843
01:13:00,113 --> 01:13:00,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So again,

844
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Same as Kinga put in the paper, shame on the gaming commission.

845
01:13:07,155 --> 01:13:11,257
[SPEAKER_09]: If they can't see through the sham, that uncle is trying to put through here.

846
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:20,583
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I'll support whatever letter, I think we've all sent letters, but again, I think there's a meeting.

847
01:13:21,123 --> 01:13:22,664
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the meeting is on Thursday.

848
01:13:23,104 --> 01:13:28,148
[SPEAKER_09]: So even if we send a letter, I don't think it's gonna get there in time, if I'm not mistaken.

849
01:13:28,168 --> 01:13:29,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the meeting's on the 10th.

850
01:13:33,203 --> 01:13:34,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Thursday's the 10th, correct?

851
01:13:36,644 --> 01:13:38,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was the 10th, if I'm not mistaken, maybe I'm wrong.

852
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:46,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but I said, I don't know if we can get a letter that I'm quick enough to even do this, but again, it's on Wednesday.

853
01:13:46,808 --> 01:13:55,491
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another backdoor attempt to hurt the communities and violate the spirit of the agreement that may be out.

854
01:13:56,983 --> 01:14:08,789
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people weren't around when John Tarko came around to the communities and gave everybody the big spiel, how great this casino is gonna be and all the benefits for the community and all the good things they're gonna do for this community.

855
01:14:09,809 --> 01:14:11,690
[SPEAKER_09]: They were gonna use local vendors.

856
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:15,772
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day, Enclave did crap for everybody.

857
01:14:16,112 --> 01:14:20,474
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know what to say on this.

858
01:14:21,095 --> 01:14:22,355
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not good neighbors to anybody.

859
01:14:24,196 --> 01:14:25,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

860
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:27,681
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

861
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:29,443
[SPEAKER_28]: And thank you, President Morell for putting this forward.

862
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:34,047
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd certainly second your motion for approval if there's a motion already.

863
01:14:34,087 --> 01:14:42,375
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that it's a good idea to put this forward, you know, regardless of the recent change in the proposal, you know, as articulated by councilors already, the plan has changed.

864
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:50,322
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's a good idea for us to say in one voice as a council, you know, we need to stand up for the spirit of the Community Benefits Agreement that Wynne entered into.

865
01:14:50,342 --> 01:14:51,123
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

866
01:14:51,749 --> 01:14:54,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's gone so emotionally Council Collins to approve second by.

867
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,913
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Councilor Knight second by Councilor councilor night.

868
01:14:58,354 --> 01:15:02,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I think, if my memory serves me correctly.

869
01:15:03,697 --> 01:15:10,362
[SPEAKER_11]: This paper was put on in the council voted to request that the mayor write a letter to the Gaming Commission.

870
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:17,587
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor wrote a letter to the Gaming Commission reported back to the council that you wrote a letter to the Gaming Commission and suggested that we do so as well.

871
01:15:19,011 --> 01:15:26,336
[SPEAKER_11]: If we're going to send a letter to the Gaming Commission, after we just directed the mayor to send a letter to the Gaming Commission, I think we need to be sure that we're consistent in our message.

872
01:15:26,476 --> 01:15:35,522
[SPEAKER_11]: If we look at our agenda this evening, we want to send letters to every member of the State House, the Speaker, the Senate President, every member of our state delegation.

873
01:15:35,562 --> 01:15:37,763
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to send letters to the Mass Gaming Commission over here.

874
01:15:38,044 --> 01:15:39,865
[SPEAKER_11]: We're like letter-writing nuts right now, Mr. President.

875
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:43,409
[SPEAKER_11]: At the end of the day, we need to have a concise and consistent message.

876
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:54,965
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be delivered as a city, not as one body in the city, this body in the city, we need to take a look at what the mayor wrote and craft a letter that shows some consistency, so that we're not asking for two different things.

877
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:56,865
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's very important.

878
01:15:57,326 --> 01:16:03,628
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, if we're going to be sending letters to places, we need to be sure that our game is tight, and that what we're asking for is what we're asking for.

879
01:16:03,828 --> 01:16:07,129
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not for the cameras, it's for the policy, it's not for the politics.

880
01:16:07,669 --> 01:16:07,909
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

881
01:16:08,129 --> 01:16:10,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, ultimately, that's what it comes down to, Mr. President.

882
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:21,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, you know, if we're going to be asking the Gaming Commission to take a stand, the stand that we're asking them to take can't be a stand of the city council, it can't be a stand of the administration, it has to be a stand of the city of Medford.

883
01:16:22,586 --> 01:16:24,427
[SPEAKER_11]: stand all of us together unified.

884
01:16:24,767 --> 01:16:26,528
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I have no problem sending a letter.

885
01:16:26,888 --> 01:16:38,713
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wish that we could probably work with the administration a little bit more cooperatively in addressing large issues like this that are impacting our community, especially when the mayor's action came at the directive of the council in the first place.

886
01:16:39,593 --> 01:16:47,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I support the intent of the paper, but I just want to be sure that what we're sending is a message of consistency.

887
01:16:49,394 --> 01:16:50,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

888
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:51,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

889
01:16:51,718 --> 01:16:52,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

890
01:16:52,780 --> 01:17:00,353
[SPEAKER_09]: On another note pertaining to this, there was a motion to supply some funding.

891
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:04,019
[SPEAKER_09]: for attorney fees.

892
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:06,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are we with that?

893
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:12,483
[SPEAKER_10]: We have not received to my knowledge, unless the clerk has information otherwise, an appropriation request from the mayor's office.

894
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:13,923
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think the mayor has to even ask us.

895
01:17:13,983 --> 01:17:16,684
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the mayor has the authority to do that in Rome without even asking.

896
01:17:16,704 --> 01:17:18,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that may be possible.

897
01:17:18,825 --> 01:17:21,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And I say, we can't do it on our own.

898
01:17:21,606 --> 01:17:24,648
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the mayor can do that in Rome without even asking us.

899
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:26,568
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a good gesture for her to do that.

900
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:28,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would hope that it gets done.

901
01:17:29,550 --> 01:17:29,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Again,

902
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:39,789
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people don't realize that, that Mr. Bloom right is on the, on the end of is one of his extensions here.

903
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:48,532
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd hate this, have the gentleman say hey, I'm not getting support from the community and and not renew.

904
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:50,573
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, this is a.

905
01:17:52,298 --> 01:17:54,340
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a big part of our downtown area.

906
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:56,803
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to be addressed, and it needs to be addressed quick.

907
01:17:56,843 --> 01:18:01,247
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, again, they're gonna be making a decision on this this week, or very close to it.

908
01:18:01,988 --> 01:18:07,354
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't have a seat at that table, which is really disappointing to me.

909
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:09,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

910
01:18:09,911 --> 01:18:13,693
[SPEAKER_10]: On the matter of the appropriation, I don't think anyone in this, well, I'll speak for myself.

911
01:18:13,813 --> 01:18:22,316
[SPEAKER_10]: I was certainly not opposed to adding money to that pot, but I just believe procedurally, if it was gonna come before us, it has to come from the mayor as an appropriation.

912
01:18:25,157 --> 01:18:30,919
[SPEAKER_10]: If she can do it herself, that's another matter, but I certainly know we can't initiate that process.

913
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,901
[SPEAKER_10]: She seems to have stepped out.

914
01:18:34,621 --> 01:18:37,502
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Caraviello to approve,

915
01:18:39,611 --> 01:18:40,292
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other discussion.

916
01:18:41,693 --> 01:18:43,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

917
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:49,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

918
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:49,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

919
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:50,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

920
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:50,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

921
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:52,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

922
01:18:52,321 --> 01:18:52,421
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

923
01:18:52,481 --> 01:18:52,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

924
01:18:52,901 --> 01:18:53,081
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

925
01:19:06,707 --> 01:19:11,048
[SPEAKER_10]: 22-068 offered by counselor saying be resolved that the Metro City Council as the city of

926
01:19:11,673 --> 01:19:21,997
[SPEAKER_10]: City Administration and the Office of Planning, Sustainability, and Development to study and reach out to potential locations for public art projects like murals and to publish these locations on the city website.

927
01:19:22,437 --> 01:19:26,139
[SPEAKER_10]: These locations should also keep in mind potential problems of equity, gentrification, and access.

928
01:19:26,559 --> 01:19:38,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council asks the City Administration and the Office of Planning, Sustainability, and Development to create online and physical forms where members of the community and business owners can express their interest in taking part in public arts projects.

929
01:19:38,784 --> 01:19:39,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng.

930
01:19:39,884 --> 01:19:50,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President, um, this came out of talking with members of the Medford Arts Council, and listening to their updates about plans for potential public arts projects coming into the city.

931
01:19:51,352 --> 01:19:58,938
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be very difficult for artists to, to participate you know in the civic, civic art landscape.

932
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:16,323
[SPEAKER_06]: of our city and I thought that this would be one small step in in helping expedite the process of creating more public arts projects and helping us plan better plan, the visual aesthetic qualities of our neighborhoods on to get community feedback.

933
01:20:17,583 --> 01:20:19,264
[SPEAKER_06]: to expedite that process as well.

934
01:20:19,284 --> 01:20:25,229
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a sense of what our residents actually want our neighborhoods and our business districts look like.

935
01:20:25,789 --> 01:20:34,956
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought that this would be a good way to get greater involved to involve the members of our communities from residents, business owners, to a greater extent.

936
01:20:36,177 --> 01:20:42,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is also a measure of transparency by publishing on the city website, we I think, make ourselves more a

937
01:20:43,482 --> 01:20:49,466
[SPEAKER_06]: more palatable and more open options for artists in our community and in the greater Boston area.

938
01:20:50,707 --> 01:21:01,514
[SPEAKER_06]: And by having both online and physical forms, I think this would create a greater accessibility and help expedite the process quicker.

939
01:21:01,534 --> 01:21:07,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I also added one line in there about equity, gentrification, access to

940
01:21:07,554 --> 01:21:13,819
[SPEAKER_06]: because I did want to note that many of these art projects do add to the effects of gentrification.

941
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:20,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm curious as to how the city would also seek to address these problems as well.

942
01:21:22,827 --> 01:21:25,009
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Knight.

943
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:27,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

944
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:30,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Councilor Collins.

945
01:21:32,175 --> 01:21:35,517
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll be brief, but as a person who in my other work,

946
01:21:37,748 --> 01:21:38,048
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

947
01:21:40,069 --> 01:21:40,509
[SPEAKER_28]: What was that?

948
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:41,790
[SPEAKER_10]: You said you could say thank you.

949
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:42,991
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, wait, is that a rule?

950
01:21:43,451 --> 01:21:43,951
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

951
01:21:45,312 --> 01:21:46,492
[SPEAKER_10]: As an artist, I believe he meant.

952
01:21:49,734 --> 01:21:51,155
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you made me lose my train of thought.

953
01:21:51,175 --> 01:21:53,436
[SPEAKER_28]: I was going to say, thank you, Councilor Knight.

954
01:21:57,461 --> 01:22:13,009
[SPEAKER_28]: As a person who does public art professionally, I thank Councilor Tseng for bringing this forward and I agree, you know, from my own experience and from talking to other people in the field, you know, public art can really seem like a black box to people, you know, amateur artists, professionals who are trying to get into the field.

955
01:22:13,049 --> 01:22:17,711
[SPEAKER_28]: I also think that with so many other things, equity is a huge issue in the public art field.

956
01:22:18,598 --> 01:22:33,922
[SPEAKER_28]: you know, anything that we can do to further our efforts to be transparent about the process can help more people in the community both take on these opportunities and also weigh in on what kind of public art we wanna see in our community and where, so I think it's a great idea.

957
01:22:33,942 --> 01:22:36,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

958
01:22:36,422 --> 01:22:40,483
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

959
01:22:42,764 --> 01:22:43,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello?

960
01:22:43,904 --> 01:22:44,144
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

961
01:22:44,764 --> 01:22:45,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins?

962
01:22:46,565 --> 01:22:46,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

963
01:22:47,571 --> 01:22:48,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

964
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:48,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

965
01:22:48,692 --> 01:22:49,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

966
01:22:49,452 --> 01:22:49,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

967
01:22:50,293 --> 01:22:50,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

968
01:22:51,013 --> 01:22:51,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

969
01:22:51,854 --> 01:22:52,474
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morell.

970
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:53,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

971
01:22:54,155 --> 01:22:54,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

972
01:22:55,015 --> 01:22:55,316
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

973
01:22:56,356 --> 01:23:04,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

974
01:23:05,201 --> 01:23:09,944
[SPEAKER_09]: 22069 offered by Vice President Bears be resolved with Medford City Council that ordinance 854 section

975
01:23:12,145 --> 01:23:14,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what general operational provisions be.

976
01:23:15,988 --> 01:23:18,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Operational provisions be amended to add the following.

977
01:23:19,451 --> 01:23:20,812
[SPEAKER_09]: F, employment plan.

978
01:23:21,212 --> 01:23:26,176
[SPEAKER_09]: An applicant for a special permit pursuant to this ordinance shall submit an employment plan.

979
01:23:26,717 --> 01:23:36,404
[SPEAKER_09]: The plan shall include a labor peace agreement with a bona fide labor organization affiliated with the AFL-CIO that already represents cannabis workers.

980
01:23:37,465 --> 01:23:38,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Letters of support

981
01:23:39,718 --> 01:23:53,312
[SPEAKER_09]: From labor unions, union members, living in the community, Greater Boston Labor Council, the state AFL-CIO, and the Project Labor Agreement be in place with building trades for the construction of retrofitting a cannabis facility.

982
01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:56,069
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Bears.

983
01:23:56,209 --> 01:23:57,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

984
01:23:58,051 --> 01:24:23,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas this would be an amendment to the marijuana zoning ordinance, my preference here, the intent of this ordinance is to ensure that both the construction and staffing of marijuana establishments here in our community, whether they are dispensaries or they are, you know, many of the other variety of marijuana companies that may come here are providing good union jobs that are providing good wages to the people of our community.

985
01:24:24,944 --> 01:24:51,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, whereas this was a change to our zoning, I would like to motion to join this with paper 20-568 and refer it to committee of the whole to get information, you know, discuss this maybe after we discuss the community development board recommendations tomorrow, to discuss this with attorney Dabrowski and see if this is a potential way forward to ensure labor, supportive labor in the marijuana industry here in Medford.

986
01:24:52,486 --> 01:25:01,979
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also know after discussion with my fellow counselors, there is Mr. Gabriel Camacho, representative of UFCW Local 1445 is with us on Zoom.

987
01:25:07,547 --> 01:25:08,028
[SPEAKER_20]: You want to call it?

988
01:25:15,219 --> 01:25:18,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I certainly support the theory of the measure.

989
01:25:18,982 --> 01:25:19,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly support the measure.

990
01:25:20,003 --> 01:25:21,684
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that's very interesting.

991
01:25:21,704 --> 01:25:26,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I question whether or not it needs to be reviewed by the solicitor or whether this came from legal counsel.

992
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:34,554
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the other sponsor of the resolution can offer that this has been worked on through legal counsel of some shape or form, maybe with UFCW.

993
01:25:38,444 --> 01:26:04,103
[SPEAKER_10]: The provisions were, I can't speak for the UFCW, maybe if they, if Mr. Camacho is on the line, if he could discuss whether this came from council or not, I would like to have it reviewed by, at least by Attorney Bobrowski as well, just to, you know, I think our marijuana ordinance with the zoning ordinance piece and also the separate Cannabis Advisory Committee piece, you know, it may be a unique structure compared to other communities.

994
01:26:04,283 --> 01:26:06,665
[SPEAKER_10]: So is Mr. Camacho on the line?

995
01:26:09,048 --> 01:26:09,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

996
01:26:09,728 --> 01:26:10,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

997
01:26:10,389 --> 01:26:14,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me, Mr. Camacho, name and address of the record, please.

998
01:26:15,532 --> 01:26:19,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Gabriel Camacho, 243 Boylston Street in Watertown.

999
01:26:19,735 --> 01:26:25,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the political director for United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1445.

1000
01:26:25,959 --> 01:26:32,864
[SPEAKER_03]: We have members who live in Medford, and we represent approximately 12,000 essential workers throughout the Commonwealth.

1001
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:44,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Most recently, we've been organizing in the cannabis sector, both in grow facilities, medical dispensaries, and recreational adult use dispensaries.

1002
01:26:45,347 --> 01:26:59,832
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a number of amendments to cannabis ordinances that have been introduced in various municipalities in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as state law in New Jersey, California, Colorado,

1003
01:27:01,032 --> 01:27:19,203
[SPEAKER_03]: New York, that as a condition of licensure, that a labor peace agreement be in place with a union that represents cannabis workers in order to have that license given as well as to renew a license.

1004
01:27:20,483 --> 01:27:39,735
[SPEAKER_03]: The language of our ordinances and our state bill that just made it out of committee actually last week has been reviewed by council and we are confident that this will pass legal mustard in Medford.

1005
01:27:41,015 --> 01:27:56,558
[SPEAKER_03]: We also think this is very important because, as you know, the cannabis industry last year reached over $2 billion in gross revenues in Massachusetts, and it is a relatively new industry in Massachusetts.

1006
01:27:57,279 --> 01:27:59,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to get this industry right.

1007
01:28:00,499 --> 01:28:03,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it is a growing industry,

1008
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:15,425
[SPEAKER_03]: the attorney general has fined cannabis companies hundreds of thousands of dollars for violations of labor law in the state.

1009
01:28:15,445 --> 01:28:26,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would never happen if a labor peace agreement or indeed a collective bargaining agreement was in place between a union and a cannabis company.

1010
01:28:29,812 --> 01:28:30,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I will take your questions.

1011
01:28:32,592 --> 01:28:33,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further questions?

1012
01:28:33,552 --> 01:28:35,933
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, that highlights some of the questions that I had.

1013
01:28:35,993 --> 01:28:44,114
[SPEAKER_11]: It's certainly an interesting theory that the council can tie licensure requirements to union membership.

1014
01:28:44,414 --> 01:28:45,274
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very interesting.

1015
01:28:46,495 --> 01:28:52,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, let me just clarify, not union membership, to have a labor peace agreement in place.

1016
01:28:52,496 --> 01:28:58,477
[SPEAKER_03]: A labor peace agreement is basically an agreement between an employer and a union

1017
01:28:59,097 --> 01:29:15,851
[SPEAKER_03]: in which the employer agrees to remain neutral during an organizing drive, and the union in turn agrees not to take any adverse labor actions against the company or disparage it publicly.

1018
01:29:16,211 --> 01:29:26,660
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it allows the employees to decide whether to unionize or not without any undue interference from the employer.

1019
01:29:28,373 --> 01:29:29,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1020
01:29:30,515 --> 01:29:36,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I was referring to wasn't the peace agreement, but rather the requirement that a project labor agreement be in place.

1021
01:29:37,419 --> 01:29:38,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, very well.

1022
01:29:39,028 --> 01:29:42,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I mean, Mr. Camacho I know you don't know me from a hole in the wall.

1023
01:29:42,449 --> 01:30:06,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I came from the unions I worked at SIU for a number of years I negotiated over 40 contracts I represented close to 12,000 employees between Worcester and Essex County and Suffolk County and Middlesex County so I've certainly been familiar with the union world and it's something that I certainly want to support but like Councilor Behr said if we're going to do it let's do it right and if you like what you said if we're going to do it let's do it right so I just want to make sure that

1024
01:30:06,736 --> 01:30:07,557
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't get challenged.

1025
01:30:07,637 --> 01:30:16,827
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in a process right now where it's taken probably, we're probably the slowest community in all the world to license the marijuana facility in Massachusetts.

1026
01:30:17,347 --> 01:30:21,051
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've gotten this far, and I'd hate to see the process stalled.

1027
01:30:21,912 --> 01:30:23,834
[SPEAKER_11]: The administration's done a great job of doing that already.

1028
01:30:24,435 --> 01:30:26,157
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I certainly support this.

1029
01:30:26,237 --> 01:30:27,198
[SPEAKER_11]: I support working families.

1030
01:30:27,771 --> 01:30:28,451
[SPEAKER_11]: And I always will.

1031
01:30:28,671 --> 01:30:31,233
[SPEAKER_11]: If you don't know what you stand for, then you can't stand for anything.

1032
01:30:31,273 --> 01:30:32,793
[SPEAKER_11]: This is certainly something that I stand for.

1033
01:30:33,073 --> 01:30:34,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand for good wages.

1034
01:30:34,134 --> 01:30:36,395
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand for health benefits, retirement benefits for workers.

1035
01:30:36,475 --> 01:30:37,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand for a living wage.

1036
01:30:38,295 --> 01:30:41,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that these are things that bring our community up, right?

1037
01:30:41,177 --> 01:30:45,999
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have good wages in the community, then people can spend their ancillary money in the circular flow of our economy.

1038
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:48,099
[SPEAKER_11]: The discretionary funds go back into our economy.

1039
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:48,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a good thing.

1040
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:53,101
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that being said, I support this wholeheartedly and I have no problem seconding the motion by the council.

1041
01:30:53,882 --> 01:30:54,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1042
01:30:54,821 --> 01:30:55,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bess.

1043
01:30:55,961 --> 01:30:57,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1044
01:30:57,162 --> 01:30:57,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1045
01:30:57,922 --> 01:31:02,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and you know, I really want to thank Mr. Camacho and UFCW Local 1445.

1046
01:31:03,304 --> 01:31:06,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that I have some friends who have worked in the industry.

1047
01:31:07,586 --> 01:31:18,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Their place of employment was able to unionize with UFCW Local 1445 and they have a much improved standard of working conditions and they're much happier in their positions.

1048
01:31:18,411 --> 01:31:22,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So my hope is that we can make sure that is how the industry works here in Medford as well.

1049
01:31:24,493 --> 01:31:27,415
[SPEAKER_10]: with Councilor Nides second, you know, happy to move forward.

1050
01:31:28,215 --> 01:31:29,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just have an opinion.

1051
01:31:30,156 --> 01:31:31,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a problem supporting this.

1052
01:31:31,897 --> 01:31:42,662
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a problem with it only because we've already gone through the process and I'm not big on changing the rules after the game has already started.

1053
01:31:43,443 --> 01:31:44,303
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where I have an issue.

1054
01:31:44,363 --> 01:31:47,384
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, I don't oppose this.

1055
01:31:47,445 --> 01:31:50,066
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need a legal opinion that we can do this

1056
01:31:51,781 --> 01:31:54,563
[SPEAKER_09]: after these people have already interviewed and put their licenses in.

1057
01:31:54,703 --> 01:32:01,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to make sure that we're on solid ground here before we go further.

1058
01:32:01,167 --> 01:32:06,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to amend it that we get a legal opinion, making sure that we're okay doing this.

1059
01:32:06,790 --> 01:32:07,370
[SPEAKER_10]: For sure.

1060
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:10,232
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping that Attorney Brasco will review it as well as Solicitor Stantlin.

1061
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:19,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Because it's a zoning paper, Mr. President, and we have a zoning codification issue that's coming up, it doesn't have to be part of the codification.

1062
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:26,552
[SPEAKER_11]: It can go through as an amendment to the existing zoning ordinance for the cannabis licensure, right?

1063
01:32:26,592 --> 01:32:28,093
[SPEAKER_11]: And it can go through the process itself.

1064
01:32:28,153 --> 01:32:29,793
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, we have to do it that way.

1065
01:32:29,813 --> 01:32:38,615
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have to tie it to the recodification and blow that thing up, you know what I mean, as we're going through the process, because we're at the Penn Yard line.

1066
01:32:39,665 --> 01:32:42,087
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have no issue with the future motion to sever this.

1067
01:32:42,487 --> 01:32:53,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I just felt, you know, given that I feel like it's- Right, given that it's in the spirit of the council, given that we're already having the meeting with the attorney and given that, you know, we have the ability to amend the resolution.

1068
01:32:54,355 --> 01:32:56,277
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is not on tomorrow night's agenda either.

1069
01:32:56,597 --> 01:33:00,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, my motion was to join it with paper 20-568, which is- Which one is that?

1070
01:33:01,561 --> 01:33:04,383
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the paper we're using for zoning recodification.

1071
01:33:04,423 --> 01:33:08,145
[SPEAKER_10]: So my motion was to send this to committee of the whole and join it with 20-568.

1072
01:33:11,969 --> 01:33:13,610
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1073
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:18,192
[SPEAKER_09]: I say that's again you're joining it before the paper goes on the floor.

1074
01:33:18,472 --> 01:33:22,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, to be honest, to be frank, I think, I think, I think, given, given the paper, I mean, to be honest.

1075
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:33,823
[SPEAKER_10]: given that it's an amendment to the zoning ordinance, I would feel comfortable bringing the text tomorrow night to discuss under the zoning.

1076
01:33:34,023 --> 01:33:43,766
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we refer it to committee, the whole, you know, I would, I was putting this on so we could have a discussion tonight and have it in open council and also have the ability to separate in the future.

1077
01:33:43,846 --> 01:33:50,447
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also think it's, it is an amendment to the zoning ordinance where tomorrow night we're discussing amendments to the zoning ordinance.

1078
01:33:51,008 --> 01:33:51,768
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't, you know,

1079
01:33:52,728 --> 01:34:00,512
[SPEAKER_10]: For example, when we were doing committees of the whole in last year, we weren't saying we're only discussing this section tonight and this section tonight and this section tonight.

1080
01:34:00,932 --> 01:34:02,152
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the full zoning ordinance.

1081
01:34:02,213 --> 01:34:07,155
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, that's, I'm not trying to, I'm not trying to get around anything here.

1082
01:34:07,175 --> 01:34:10,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure that we're on legal.

1083
01:34:10,696 --> 01:34:16,319
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got Mr. President, before we, before we get out some trouble.

1084
01:34:18,564 --> 01:34:33,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President, I understand the intention of this I am with the other councils I'm not having a separate committee the whole simply because the zoning meeting the committee the whole tomorrow is to review the, the CD boards recommendations and since this is outside of it doesn't feel like we have the proper.

1085
01:34:33,451 --> 01:34:48,037
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry, agenda like agenda notice time for such a topic that would be my opinion on this so like other issues tonight I just want to make sure we're doing this the right way so we don't get caught not being able to do what we're intending to do here.

1086
01:34:49,595 --> 01:35:07,405
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, if we were to, you know, if we were to review the meeting notice for tomorrow evening, let's say paper 20-568 zoning recodification, you know, and reviewing amendments to the zoning ordinance, I think that this would fall under that, that posting.

1087
01:35:08,066 --> 01:35:11,888
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I'm happy to refer to Committee of the Whole, not join it with the other paper.

1088
01:35:12,328 --> 01:35:14,050
[SPEAKER_10]: If we want to have another meeting on in the future.

1089
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:20,835
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still going to bring it up tomorrow night, whether or not you know that that's just what I'm going to do in the committee the whole meeting either way.

1090
01:35:21,035 --> 01:35:34,346
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think it's an amendment to the zoning ordinance and we're discussing amendments to the zoning ordinance, I, I'm gonna I'm gonna agree with the with the president that we're dealing with the recommendations from the board.

1091
01:35:34,727 --> 01:35:35,307
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.

1092
01:35:35,527 --> 01:35:36,228
[SPEAKER_10]: That's coming up.

1093
01:35:36,408 --> 01:35:38,570
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna have a motion to join it right.

1094
01:35:41,598 --> 01:35:43,419
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we vote on the motion to join it.

1095
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:45,200
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the motion goes down.

1096
01:35:45,721 --> 01:35:46,501
[SPEAKER_11]: You really can't bring it up.

1097
01:35:46,561 --> 01:35:49,724
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, I'm saying.

1098
01:35:49,824 --> 01:35:53,286
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have two different votes.

1099
01:35:53,506 --> 01:35:54,467
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have one to join it.

1100
01:35:54,987 --> 01:35:56,088
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no motion to join.

1101
01:35:56,108 --> 01:35:58,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Just motion to send this to Committee of the Whole as it is.

1102
01:35:58,149 --> 01:36:00,031
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't have us vote on it and then bring it up again, right?

1103
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:07,357
[SPEAKER_09]: If it goes down, I'm gonna vote for it.

1104
01:36:07,477 --> 01:36:08,958
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm voting yes.

1105
01:36:08,998 --> 01:36:13,821
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could amend it to have a legal opinion ready for when we have the committee at the hall, it would be great.

1106
01:36:13,841 --> 01:36:16,303
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't have to have the committee at the hall, then ask for a legal opinion too.

1107
01:36:17,363 --> 01:36:18,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, yeah, I mean.

1108
01:36:18,244 --> 01:36:20,065
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why the opinion will be out.

1109
01:36:20,125 --> 01:36:21,106
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll have the opinion.

1110
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:24,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, why don't we amend the paper to ask for a legal opinion on this language right here?

1111
01:36:24,768 --> 01:36:26,929
[SPEAKER_11]: The senator has a solicitor now, she'll get that back to us.

1112
01:36:26,949 --> 01:36:28,370
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine, yeah, that's fine.

1113
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:30,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, so, okay, here's my question.

1114
01:36:31,909 --> 01:36:39,656
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, my goal here was not to have an entirely separate committee, the whole meeting, because it's one amendment in the context of many amendments.

1115
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:42,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think it needs an hour and a half of a meeting.

1116
01:36:43,059 --> 01:36:51,227
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm happy to refer it, either to keep it, table it here, pending a legal opinion, and then we can discuss it when the public hearing reopens on the zoning recodification.

1117
01:36:51,247 --> 01:36:55,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to refer it to committee of the whole, and then have it, you know,

1118
01:36:58,671 --> 01:37:04,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in a motion to accept your amendment to have a legal opinion and then table it on the council agenda pending that legal opinion.

1119
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:13,365
[SPEAKER_09]: So, on the motion by Councilor Bears to table this until we have a legal opinion, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1120
01:37:13,785 --> 01:37:14,546
[SPEAKER_11]: One major question.

1121
01:37:15,187 --> 01:37:16,768
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the question we're asking the solicitor?

1122
01:37:17,949 --> 01:37:19,831
[SPEAKER_09]: The question would be the legality of

1123
01:37:21,174 --> 01:37:24,318
[SPEAKER_09]: changing the agreement that we already have in place, you need to ask her a question.

1124
01:37:24,458 --> 01:37:27,401
[SPEAKER_11]: If we want the solicitor to give us a legal opinion we need to ask the city.

1125
01:37:27,461 --> 01:37:39,174
[SPEAKER_10]: My question would be that we ask that the city solicitor and attorney Bobrowski both render an opinion as to whether this is permissible under Massachusetts zoning laws.

1126
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:55,062
[SPEAKER_10]: And then secondly, if you know what you were saying Councilor Caraviello a motion to have a legal opinion from the city solicitor as to whether this affects ongoing negotiations with applicants to the city.

1127
01:37:55,423 --> 01:37:56,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1128
01:37:57,004 --> 01:37:58,445
[SPEAKER_10]: And again my one second.

1129
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:04,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Give them a second.

1130
01:38:04,873 --> 01:38:05,834
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not a legal question.

1131
01:38:05,854 --> 01:38:06,995
[SPEAKER_11]: That's an operational question.

1132
01:38:07,236 --> 01:38:11,059
[SPEAKER_17]: The second one is just Councilor Caraviello's concern.

1133
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:15,684
[SPEAKER_17]: If this is, this is legal, we have the license that all these people have already gone through the licensing process.

1134
01:38:26,243 --> 01:38:30,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, and again, the intent here is this would apply- And again, I don't have a problem supporting it, just- No, I know.

1135
01:38:31,006 --> 01:38:37,050
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanna make sure that we didn't change the rules halfway into the game to these other people that have already done their license process.

1136
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:41,772
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanna be clear, the reason that I put it under the zoning ordinance is because that's referring to host community agreements.

1137
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:47,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, there's only one host community agreement being negotiated, so it may apply to the dispensaries.

1138
01:38:47,216 --> 01:38:55,281
[SPEAKER_10]: But the other thing here is that this could apply to the non-dispensary projects, which there are many marijuana businesses that we are allowing

1139
01:38:56,081 --> 01:39:01,065
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe, at least under a less restrictive process than the dispensary process.

1140
01:39:01,546 --> 01:39:05,269
[SPEAKER_09]: So, on the motion by Councilor Bears as amended.

1141
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:08,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1142
01:39:08,712 --> 01:39:09,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1143
01:39:10,754 --> 01:39:11,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Further discussion?

1144
01:39:11,755 --> 01:39:12,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Move forward.

1145
01:39:13,176 --> 01:39:14,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Kastane, do you want to speak?

1146
01:39:23,166 --> 01:39:40,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing up higher pay for the cannabis industry, especially with three entities soon hopefully to be opened in Medford, and who knows what other type of cannabis entities might also open down the road.

1147
01:39:43,133 --> 01:39:46,975
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank you for that, because I'm sure it's a very lucrative business.

1148
01:39:48,018 --> 01:39:57,505
[SPEAKER_14]: especially with only three in the city at this point coming, unless there's too much competition, that might affect their profitability, of course.

1149
01:39:59,106 --> 01:40:11,235
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm interested in Mr. Camucho, if he's still there, I'd like to make a point that I believe he said that some of these cannabis owners,

1150
01:40:12,199 --> 01:40:18,043
[SPEAKER_14]: have paid fines on the unfair labor practices come with the Massachusetts.

1151
01:40:18,183 --> 01:40:18,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that true?

1152
01:40:20,145 --> 01:40:22,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is Gabriel Camacho.

1153
01:40:22,046 --> 01:40:28,771
[SPEAKER_03]: A number of months ago, the attorney general issued a press release talking basically

1154
01:40:31,996 --> 01:40:46,582
[SPEAKER_03]: issuing a report that the cannabis industry is engaged in violations of state labor law, in particular wage, hour, and premium pay during holidays.

1155
01:40:47,302 --> 01:40:58,386
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why certain cannabis companies have been fined hundreds of thousands of dollars by the state of Massachusetts for violations of these laws.

1156
01:41:00,188 --> 01:41:00,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.

1157
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:11,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know if this company has entered as one of the nine proposals for Medford or Mystic Avenue?

1158
01:41:11,837 --> 01:41:19,103
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe the address was like 142 or 144 Mystic Avenue to the right of Atlas Liquors.

1159
01:41:19,183 --> 01:41:22,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know if they've been fined by the state government?

1160
01:41:23,086 --> 01:41:23,666
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they haven't.

1161
01:41:25,188 --> 01:41:26,549
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the name of that company, sir?

1162
01:41:30,131 --> 01:41:34,374
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, this gentleman works for the UFCW as a representative of a labor organization.

1163
01:41:34,394 --> 01:41:35,555
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not an entity with the city.

1164
01:41:35,615 --> 01:41:38,457
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm unsure- There's nine companies that apply for a license here.

1165
01:41:38,517 --> 01:41:41,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure- I assume.

1166
01:41:41,579 --> 01:41:44,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know the name of that company, Mr. Camucho?

1167
01:41:45,402 --> 01:41:48,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's public record under the attorney general's office.

1168
01:41:49,665 --> 01:41:50,105
[SPEAKER_14]: I see.

1169
01:41:50,806 --> 01:41:52,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Wage and hour division.

1170
01:41:53,568 --> 01:41:53,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1171
01:41:54,409 --> 01:41:58,672
[SPEAKER_14]: And do you know if any of the nine applicants have violated the state law?

1172
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:03,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not familiar with all the applicants in Medford, sir.

1173
01:42:04,001 --> 01:42:06,322
[SPEAKER_11]: The gentleman is a representative of a labor organization.

1174
01:42:06,342 --> 01:42:07,883
[SPEAKER_11]: He's not a representative of the community.

1175
01:42:07,923 --> 01:42:12,446
[SPEAKER_11]: He probably doesn't even know who is applied here in the city of Medford because he doesn't work for our community.

1176
01:42:12,587 --> 01:42:18,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I'm sorry to trouble you with questions that you don't know about.

1177
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:18,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sir.

1178
01:42:18,811 --> 01:42:19,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1179
01:42:19,731 --> 01:42:23,294
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion by Councilor Bears as amended, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1180

1204

[SPEAKER_10]: These bills are all on a similar topic which is the accountability of large tax exempt institutions to municipalities here in the Commonwealth.

1206
01:44:24,009 --> 01:44:42,298
[SPEAKER_10]: The second bill H 3803 would have, I believe the Department of Revenue, study and examine, or maybe the Division of Local Services, examine how much municipal tax revenue is lost every year to large tax exempt institutions.

1207
01:44:43,078 --> 01:44:58,764
[SPEAKER_10]: And the third bill is something this council has already voted through as a home roll petition, but still has not passed due to the objection of ACUM and the private college and university lobby, which is requiring an institutional master plan from Tufts University.

1208
01:44:59,524 --> 01:45:06,207
[SPEAKER_10]: So these three bills, again, I believe all three of them survive joint roll 10 day and have extensions in their committees.

1209
01:45:06,927 --> 01:45:08,128
[SPEAKER_10]: So it would be great if,

1210
01:45:09,088 --> 01:45:30,423
[SPEAKER_10]: the state would allow us to over the objections of these, you know, very high paid lobbyists for these large private institutions allow cities and towns to adequately plan for and regulate and cooperate and collaborate with large tax exempt institutions, like large universities and hospital systems.

1211
01:45:30,984 --> 01:45:31,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1212
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,540
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1213
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:37,942
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to move to approve this measure.

1214
01:45:37,982 --> 01:45:41,383
[SPEAKER_28]: I was pleased to testify in favor of H3080 a couple of weeks ago.

1215
01:45:41,923 --> 01:45:44,684
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's an extremely important set of bills.

1216
01:45:44,765 --> 01:45:54,148
[SPEAKER_28]: They just provide a local option for municipalities to receive a more fair compensation rate from their large resident nonprofits, as we're all very aware.

1217
01:45:54,909 --> 01:46:00,431
[SPEAKER_28]: Municipalities bear a very heavy governmental load for the amount of resources that they're able to command.

1218
01:46:01,291 --> 01:46:09,475
[SPEAKER_28]: And these bills will help straighten our city municipalities like ours by providing a framework for wealthy resident nonprofits to pay their fair share.

1219
01:46:09,555 --> 01:46:18,720
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think it would be a great idea for this council to send a strong message to the state delegation of, you know, what an asset this framework would be to communities like ours.

1220
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:20,241
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1221
01:46:20,521 --> 01:46:20,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1222
01:46:26,135 --> 01:46:27,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address to the record, please.

1223
01:46:27,496 --> 01:46:31,197
[SPEAKER_07]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1224
01:46:32,157 --> 01:46:33,678
[SPEAKER_07]: This issue comes up periodically.

1225
01:46:33,698 --> 01:46:39,120
[SPEAKER_07]: The last time it did, I didn't have my act together with comments when it was discussed in council, but I did send an email.

1226
01:46:39,660 --> 01:46:45,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I thought I'd sort of repeat a summary of that email.

1227
01:46:45,382 --> 01:46:46,983
[SPEAKER_07]: The final issue comes back up.

1228
01:46:47,603 --> 01:46:56,686
[SPEAKER_07]: periodically, and I think we should begin with the principle that we want our non-profits to be vibrant institutions doing as much useful work as possible.

1229
01:46:57,006 --> 01:47:01,087
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the same time, we don't want them buying up the whole city and crowding out everyone else.

1230
01:47:01,927 --> 01:47:09,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We want them to invest in the equipment and buildings they need to fulfill their tax exempt purposes, and we want them to provide housing and jobs.

1231
01:47:11,104 --> 01:47:15,227
[SPEAKER_07]: But when the nonprofit owns land, they deny others the opportunity to do so.

1232
01:47:15,247 --> 01:47:22,793
[SPEAKER_07]: This is particularly a problem if the nonprofit is using the land to provide less housing or fewer jobs than someone else might.

1233
01:47:24,615 --> 01:47:30,039
[SPEAKER_07]: If we want to raise funds from our nonprofits, let's tax their lands and leave their buildings untaxed.

1234
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:39,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Nonprofits should not have the power to take the land off our tax rolls, but nor should we propose to levy a tax on the buildings that they need to do their work.

1235
01:47:40,563 --> 01:47:46,210
[SPEAKER_07]: It's clear to me that this is the best way to reconcile the different interests of all involved.

1236
01:47:46,830 --> 01:47:48,412
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope the city council will agree.

1237
01:47:48,432 --> 01:47:53,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope someday our legislators will agree and get an option like that passed.

1238
01:47:53,558 --> 01:47:53,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1239
01:47:56,662 --> 01:48:04,693
[SPEAKER_10]: This William you know I hadn't actually thought about this way before but the way that this is structured it would be a maximum 25% on what they would otherwise pay in property taxes.

1240
01:48:05,173 --> 01:48:13,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, looking at the city's, you know, tax classification that's probably less than what the display is between land and buildings, but it is kind of similarly.

1241
01:48:14,341 --> 01:48:17,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a similar idea, but it changes the incentives.

1242
01:48:18,004 --> 01:48:32,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Because sometimes the universities buy up land decades before they need it and let it sit idle, not generating any tax revenue, not generating any housing during housing crisis, not generating any jobs, and we want to discourage that.

1243
01:48:32,494 --> 01:48:35,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Meanwhile, we have a housing crisis, there are not enough dorms.

1244
01:48:35,816 --> 01:48:40,039
[SPEAKER_07]: We shouldn't tax them when they build a dorm, but we should tax them when they got a lot more land.

1245
01:48:41,989 --> 01:48:43,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1246
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:44,631
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President.

1247
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:51,954
[SPEAKER_22]: I do see Eric von Berg has his hand up as well on zoom, I can unmute him.

1248
01:48:51,974 --> 01:48:54,475
[SPEAKER_21]: Eric von Berg 369 high street Medford

1249
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:07,653
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, President, Vice President, members of City Council.

1250
01:49:07,733 --> 01:49:10,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.

1251
01:49:10,355 --> 01:49:13,718
[SPEAKER_21]: I am the co-chair of the Medford-Somerville Pilot Working Group.

1252
01:49:14,518 --> 01:49:17,841
[SPEAKER_21]: For too long, cities and towns in Massachusetts have deprived

1253
01:49:19,454 --> 01:49:24,456
[SPEAKER_21]: have been deprived of any tax revenue from large nonprofits because they are tax-exempt.

1254
01:49:24,577 --> 01:49:47,508
[SPEAKER_21]: These tax-exempt nonprofits conduct their business in many ways, as for-profit businesses doing research for for-profit corporations under the guise of education, and then sharing in the profits of that research, all the while doing this on untaxed land, in untaxed buildings, while using local police, fire, and DPW services.

1255
01:49:48,208 --> 01:50:00,035
[SPEAKER_21]: They expand into the community by buying up housing that borders their land, taking that housing off the tax rolls, shrinking the tax base and driving up the cost of real estate in these communities.

1256
01:50:00,656 --> 01:50:05,219
[SPEAKER_21]: In Medford, we have constant battles with Tufts University to keep them from doing this.

1257
01:50:06,383 --> 01:50:08,506
[SPEAKER_21]: to expand their footprint in our city.

1258
01:50:09,087 --> 01:50:20,662
[SPEAKER_21]: We are left to deal with housing shortages and extremely high real estate prices, which keeps many residents of our city from being able to live in Medford because it has become unaffordable.

1259
01:50:21,403 --> 01:50:34,428
[SPEAKER_21]: We've lost ER services in Lawrence Memorial Hospital because of changes that the nonprofit that owns it made, while they seem to be more interested in establishing for-profit entities within their nonprofit.

1260
01:50:34,989 --> 01:50:44,153
[SPEAKER_21]: There are too many loopholes in the tax-exempt status of these nonprofits, and there's no recourse because it is illegal to tax these institutions.

1261
01:50:45,073 --> 01:50:46,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Even when there are agreements reached

1262
01:50:48,004 --> 01:50:54,329
[SPEAKER_21]: with these institutions, they are not binding and may not be honored at any point.

1263
01:50:54,770 --> 01:50:59,473
[SPEAKER_21]: Harvard Vanguard Health decided last year to stop paying their pilot to the city.

1264
01:51:00,734 --> 01:51:07,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Cities and towns with large nonprofits end up losing untold revenue that they need and absolutely deserve.

1265
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:10,761
[SPEAKER_21]: because of our current tax structure for nonprofits.

1266
01:51:11,261 --> 01:51:16,944
[SPEAKER_21]: We need the ability to legally recoup this lost revenue in our cities.

1267
01:51:17,204 --> 01:51:21,125
[SPEAKER_21]: H3080 and S1874 are steps in the right direction.

1268
01:51:21,645 --> 01:51:36,331
[SPEAKER_21]: These bills will give communities the ability to require nonprofits with property valued at $15 million or more to pay 25% of the amount that would be paid if the property were not exempt from taxation.

1269
01:51:37,111 --> 01:51:49,837
[SPEAKER_21]: In terms of financial planning and city planning in general, H-3803 will help communities to be aware of how much revenue they are losing to large nonprofits.

1270
01:51:50,337 --> 01:52:01,523
[SPEAKER_21]: And H-2137 will give the city permission to require large nonprofits to share their institutional master plans for review by the city in order to determine how

1271
01:52:02,003 --> 01:52:05,605
[SPEAKER_21]: These institutions impact the land and life in our city.

1272
01:52:06,226 --> 01:52:15,011
[SPEAKER_21]: I urge the city council to vote in favor of resolution 22070 to support the passage of these bills at the state level.

1273
01:52:15,591 --> 01:52:17,892
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for the chance to speak on these matters.

1274
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:25,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Hearing and seeing none, on the motion by Vice President Beas.

1275
01:52:25,141 --> 01:52:25,982
[SPEAKER_09]: I may, Mr. President.

1276
01:52:27,002 --> 01:52:27,803
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

1277
01:52:27,843 --> 01:52:34,066
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just like to reiterate my concern that this council's focus should be on the items that fall within its purview and control.

1278
01:52:34,807 --> 01:52:39,249
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a very, very responsible, receptive, and capable state delegation.

1279
01:52:40,210 --> 01:52:42,231
[SPEAKER_11]: A very, very capable state delegation.

1280
01:52:43,231 --> 01:52:44,972
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not the House of Representatives.

1281
01:52:45,292 --> 01:52:46,673
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not the Massachusetts Senate.

1282
01:52:47,173 --> 01:52:51,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of bills are introduced every day in both parties.

1283
01:52:52,506 --> 01:52:57,689
[SPEAKER_11]: This council is gonna sit here and spend our time weeding through those bills and not doing the job that we're doing.

1284
01:52:58,009 --> 01:52:58,729
[SPEAKER_11]: We're doing something wrong.

1285
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:01,911
[SPEAKER_11]: We're elected to do the city's business.

1286
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:03,392
[SPEAKER_11]: This is State House talk.

1287
01:53:03,872 --> 01:53:07,274
[SPEAKER_11]: For this reason and this reason alone, I'm not gonna support this measure tonight, Mr. President.

1288
01:53:07,654 --> 01:53:13,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Week in and week out, send a letter to Karen Spilka, send a letter to Ron Mariano, send a letter to Karen Spilka, send a letter to Ron Mariano.

1289
01:53:14,157 --> 01:53:14,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Enough's enough.

1290
01:53:15,478 --> 01:53:16,599
[SPEAKER_11]: They're gonna think we're lunatics.

1291
01:53:17,583 --> 01:53:22,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Every other week, they're getting a letter from the Medford City Council saying, Medford wants this now, Medford wants that now, Medford wants this now.

1292
01:53:22,504 --> 01:53:23,784
[SPEAKER_11]: This guy in Medford, you know what I want?

1293
01:53:23,864 --> 01:53:24,384
[SPEAKER_11]: More money.

1294
01:53:24,844 --> 01:53:28,505
[SPEAKER_11]: There's one paper on this agenda this evening that I will support.

1295
01:53:29,065 --> 01:53:31,605
[SPEAKER_11]: A paper asking for an increase in House Fund funds to this community.

1296
01:53:32,086 --> 01:53:33,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I will support that paper.

1297
01:53:33,706 --> 01:53:44,228
[SPEAKER_11]: But as for us, continuously, week in and week out, supporting this piece of legislation, that piece of legislation, this piece of legislation at the State House, it's not moving this council forward, it's not moving this city forward.

1298
01:53:44,608 --> 01:53:45,708
[SPEAKER_11]: It's moving an agenda forward,

1299
01:53:46,513 --> 01:53:47,434
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's not moving us forward.

1300
01:53:48,234 --> 01:53:52,577
[SPEAKER_09]: So for that reason, Mr. President- Let the state representatives do their job.

1301
01:53:52,777 --> 01:53:55,079
[SPEAKER_10]: If they let us do our job, I wouldn't be filing these resolutions.

1302
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:57,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So, on the motion.

1303
01:53:58,501 --> 01:54:02,324
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1304
01:54:03,365 --> 01:54:04,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1305
01:54:12,051 --> 01:54:12,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears.

1306
01:54:13,052 --> 01:54:13,292
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1307
01:54:14,892 --> 01:54:15,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

1308
01:54:15,733 --> 01:54:16,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1309
01:54:16,313 --> 01:54:16,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Naito.

1310
01:54:17,014 --> 01:54:17,274
No.

1311
01:54:18,515 --> 01:54:19,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1312
01:54:19,396 --> 01:54:19,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Present.

1313
01:54:25,821 --> 01:54:26,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

1314
01:54:26,541 --> 01:54:26,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1315
01:54:29,284 --> 01:54:29,844
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morell.

1316
01:54:30,424 --> 01:54:30,705
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1317
01:54:33,387 --> 01:54:34,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello.

1318
01:54:34,107 --> 01:54:34,468
[SPEAKER_17]: Present.

1319
01:54:38,471 --> 01:54:43,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Formally affirmative, one in the negative, two present.

1320
01:54:43,766 --> 01:54:44,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1321
01:54:48,089 --> 01:54:50,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1322
01:54:54,393 --> 01:54:58,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember probably like my third meeting.

1323
01:54:58,896 --> 01:55:00,297
[SPEAKER_10]: I tried to vote present on something.

1324
01:55:00,377 --> 01:55:01,978
[SPEAKER_10]: I got, I got told I couldn't.

1325
01:55:09,112 --> 01:55:25,958
[SPEAKER_10]: 22-071 offered by Councilor Collins, whereas the Governor's fiscal year 2023 state budget proposal includes a 2.7% increase in unrestricted general government aid, and whereas this modest increase in local aid is disproportionate to the dramatic forecasted increase in 2023 state tax collections, 22% increase from

1326
01:55:29,130 --> 01:55:35,431
[SPEAKER_10]: original FY22 base and 7.3% increase from calculation of base used to create the FY22 budget.

1327
01:55:36,371 --> 01:55:48,773
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas municipalities such as ours rely on state revenue sharing to balance local budgets and fund essential services, and as we contend with the ongoing pandemic recovery in the midst of economic inflation, these resources are needed as acutely as ever.

1328
01:55:49,733 --> 01:55:55,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support for a higher level of unrestricted general government aid in the fiscal year 2023 state budget.

1329
01:55:55,875 --> 01:55:58,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution

1330
01:55:59,144 --> 01:56:04,647
[SPEAKER_10]: to the Medford legislative delegation as well as Senate President Spoka and House Speaker Mariano, Councilor Collins.

1331
01:56:05,568 --> 01:56:06,488
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1332
01:56:09,648 --> 01:56:15,251
[SPEAKER_28]: enthusiastic readers of the Massachusetts Municipal Association weekly newsletter already now.

1333
01:56:16,432 --> 01:56:22,655
[SPEAKER_28]: We are predicted to have a huge uptick in state tax collections for the upcoming fiscal year compared to the current one.

1334
01:56:23,375 --> 01:56:29,718
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a particularly dramatic increase compared to original projections for the fiscal year 2022 tax collections forecast.

1335
01:56:30,399 --> 01:56:34,181
[SPEAKER_28]: And even if you only consider the calculation of the tax base that was used to actually create

1336
01:56:35,361 --> 01:56:40,103
[SPEAKER_28]: the fiscal year 2022 state budget, it's still over a 7% increase from that number.

1337
01:56:40,163 --> 01:56:46,366
[SPEAKER_28]: Meanwhile, the level of state aid afforded to municipalities barely keeps pace with inflation.

1338
01:56:48,227 --> 01:57:02,813
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, I wanna note how the past couple of years have highlighted just how much responsibility for policy and governance rests at the most local level of governance, particularly when it comes to public health, resiliency, roads, environmental maintenance, really essential services.

1339
01:57:03,473 --> 01:57:08,554
[SPEAKER_28]: that we need to not only maintain but actually expand if we're going to do right by our community and our residents.

1340
01:57:09,934 --> 01:57:18,896
[SPEAKER_28]: So I hope that ours and other municipalities can successfully communicate to our state leaders the need to increase the level of local aid in next year's state budget.

1341
01:57:19,536 --> 01:57:24,497
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope that other municipalities will join with ours, hopefully, in advocating for this.

1342
01:57:24,537 --> 01:57:30,358
[SPEAKER_28]: And I respectfully ask for my fellow councilors' support in advocating this to our state leaders.

1343
01:57:30,458 --> 01:57:30,658
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1344
01:57:35,724 --> 01:57:37,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1345
01:57:39,865 --> 01:57:41,105

01:58:10,436 --> 01:58:11,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Present.

1360
01:58:16,121 --> 01:58:16,501
[SPEAKER_19]: For now.

1361
01:58:33,032 --> 01:58:43,116
[SPEAKER_10]: I like voting last.

1362
01:58:43,136 --> 01:58:44,556
[SPEAKER_10]: 22-072 offered by councilor Collins.

1363
01:58:45,057 --> 01:58:50,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas in February, 2020, the Medford city council, Medford school committee and mayor pledged to make our city hunger free by 2028.

1364
01:58:52,119 --> 01:58:58,822
[SPEAKER_10]: And whereas the pandemic conditions of the past two years has exacerbated hunger and food insecurity in Medford as in surrounding communities.

1365
01:58:59,662 --> 01:59:03,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council reaffirm the pledge to make our city hunger-free by 2028.

1366
01:59:03,564 --> 01:59:17,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council express support for expanding the city's capacity to address food insecurity, development of convenient and affordable food sources throughout Medford, and targeting our pandemic recovery resources towards ensuring that our community's basic needs are met.

1367
01:59:17,613 --> 01:59:18,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

1368
01:59:19,551 --> 01:59:20,452
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1369
01:59:21,513 --> 01:59:31,803
[SPEAKER_28]: So as many folks are no doubt already aware, February 3rd and 4th marked the two-year anniversary of our city's pledge to become hunger-free by 2028.

1370
01:59:33,065 --> 01:59:41,173
[SPEAKER_28]: Really grateful to the school committee, city council that were in effect at the time in 2020, as well as Mayor Lungo-Koehn for making this commitment.

1371
01:59:41,613 --> 01:59:55,621
[SPEAKER_28]: And also, you know, just want to express gratitude for the members and collaborators of the Medford Food Security Task Force for their work behind the scenes raising this issue of food security in Medford, you know, both prior to the pledge and, you know, in the time after it.

1372
01:59:56,862 --> 02:00:08,609
[SPEAKER_28]: As everybody who's working on the issue of hunger and food insecurity and Medford, you know, knows as well as anybody, there's a lot of work that we still have to do to reach the goal of actually being, you know, free of hunger and food insecurity.

1373
02:00:09,905 --> 02:00:11,886
[SPEAKER_28]: in the next six years.

1374
02:00:12,167 --> 02:00:15,029
[SPEAKER_28]: We've had some great gains, the Mystic Community Market being among them.

1375
02:00:15,469 --> 02:00:16,650
[SPEAKER_28]: There's still a very far way to go.

1376
02:00:19,093 --> 02:00:23,435
[SPEAKER_28]: So, especially given that budget season is, you know, going to be upon us before we know it.

1377
02:00:24,135 --> 02:00:27,496
[SPEAKER_28]: I just think that this is an opportunity for us to state that this is a very strong priority.

1378
02:00:28,036 --> 02:00:31,677
[SPEAKER_28]: There's no quick fixes when it comes to eradicating the issue of hunger.

1379
02:00:32,658 --> 02:00:41,821
[SPEAKER_28]: But we need to, you know, invest what needs to be invested convene the groups and conversations that need to be convened to figure out what exactly are the obstacles to eradicating hunger in our city.

1380
02:00:42,361 --> 02:00:50,684
[SPEAKER_28]: and then, you know, hopefully make haste to do the work of the economic development and programs and policies that will make going hungry in Medford a thing of the past.

1381
02:00:51,264 --> 02:00:52,164
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for your consideration.

1382
02:00:52,204 --> 02:00:55,545
[SPEAKER_10]: On a motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1383
02:00:55,565 --> 02:00:56,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

1384
02:00:56,926 --> 02:00:59,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to add my voice to support this paper.

1385
02:00:59,686 --> 02:01:01,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, for bringing this forward.

1386
02:01:02,007 --> 02:01:10,670
[SPEAKER_06]: This is something that I've talked about during the campaign is how hunger is one of the clearest measures of how we can see the disparities in our community.

1387
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:25,458
[SPEAKER_06]: working class families, families of color, LGBTQ folks, these are people who suffer the most from hunger in our society and this is a human right, to be fed is a human right.

1388
02:01:26,638 --> 02:01:32,420
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, I am strongly in favor of this, I appreciate you bringing up budget.

1389
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:44,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'd be interested personally in having in talking to the Board of Health in the future to see what exactly what steps are city can take exactly what actions that we can take on city council, if any.

1390
02:01:45,906 --> 02:01:52,051
[SPEAKER_06]: and I would be in favor of addressing such problems like the SNAP gap more specifically.

1391
02:01:53,672 --> 02:02:09,987
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a SNAP gap report published from the city of Medford which shows that if we help our residents apply for SNAP benefits, this actually brings more money to our city as well and pumps money into our local economy.

1392
02:02:10,847 --> 02:02:14,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, this is a, it's a win win for everyone really.

1393
02:02:14,110 --> 02:02:21,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and so I'd like to see what the city is playing in terms of helping us close that gap as well.

1394
02:02:24,698 --> 02:02:26,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, and thank you.

1395
02:02:34,874 --> 02:02:38,037
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no denominations or culture groups.

1396
02:02:38,417 --> 02:02:39,458
[SPEAKER_09]: It affects everybody.

1397
02:02:39,938 --> 02:02:46,063
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a food pantry here, Mr. Gav.

1398
02:02:46,864 --> 02:02:48,985
[SPEAKER_09]: We have churches that do food banks.

1399
02:02:49,406 --> 02:02:51,287
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of organizations that do food.

1400
02:02:52,408 --> 02:02:57,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody tries their hardest, but what they all look for is help.

1401
02:02:58,032 --> 02:02:58,633
[SPEAKER_09]: help do stuff.

1402
02:02:59,073 --> 02:03:03,359
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see anybody stepping up to help these people, these volunteers.

1403
02:03:03,579 --> 02:03:08,706
[SPEAKER_09]: I get on there, I work over at the Riverside Towers, I volunteer on the food bank.

1404
02:03:09,407 --> 02:03:12,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Now everybody wants to talk, but get up and help these people out.

1405
02:03:13,573 --> 02:03:14,053
[SPEAKER_09]: We sit here,

1406
02:03:15,233 --> 02:03:16,394
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk the talk, walk the walk.

1407
02:03:16,974 --> 02:03:18,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, wanna help?

1408
02:03:18,695 --> 02:03:23,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Get out there, put your body in there, go stuff bags, go deliver stuff door to door to people.

1409
02:03:24,179 --> 02:03:25,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Help everybody out.

1410
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:27,361
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all representative of this community.

1411
02:03:27,821 --> 02:03:34,046
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, I try to do my part as much as possible, but again, these people are always looking for help.

1412
02:03:34,406 --> 02:03:39,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Get on the food bank, they're there six days a week till seven, eight o'clock at night, stuffing bags of people.

1413
02:03:39,949 --> 02:03:43,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, go around to the housing authority, delivering boxes and bags to these people.

1414
02:03:43,952 --> 02:03:44,573
[SPEAKER_09]: They all need help.

1415
02:03:45,453 --> 02:03:49,535
[SPEAKER_09]: It's time for people in the community to stop talking and start stepping up.

1416
02:03:53,476 --> 02:03:54,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Tseng.

1417
02:03:54,497 --> 02:03:57,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate Councilor Caraviello's call to action.

1418
02:03:58,298 --> 02:04:01,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's particularly important to embody that message.

1419
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:07,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think one of the ways we can best do it is to make sure that systemically we are tackling this issue.

1420
02:04:10,343 --> 02:04:13,725
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1421
02:04:14,707 --> 02:04:16,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Please call the roll.

1422
02:04:20,929 --> 02:04:21,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1423
02:04:21,169 --> 02:04:21,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1424
02:04:21,329 --> 02:04:21,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1425
02:04:21,789 --> 02:04:22,069
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1426
02:04:22,950 --> 02:04:23,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1427
02:04:35,089 --> 02:04:39,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, seven in the affirmative or one in the, none in the negative, the motion passes.

1428
02:04:40,014 --> 02:04:40,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

1429
02:04:41,095 --> 02:04:43,618
[SPEAKER_28]: If I may, motion to take from the table papers 21-631, second 21-631, and 22-023.

1430
02:04:43,638 --> 02:04:47,361
[SPEAKER_28]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, same papers 21-631, 21-631, and 20-... Sorry, one second.

1431
02:05:01,513 --> 02:05:04,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I have a paper that's related to that requesting a legal opinion.

1432
02:05:04,437 --> 02:05:04,457
[SPEAKER_07]: 22-023.

1433
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:05,739
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please spell the roll.

1434
02:05:14,039 --> 02:05:16,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, from a procedural standpoint, there is a paper that's pending.

1435
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:19,220
[SPEAKER_10]: We will take it up after this paper.

1436
02:05:19,980 --> 02:05:24,322
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll kind of put the cap before the horse, this is why I raised the issue.

1437
02:05:24,862 --> 02:05:31,343
[SPEAKER_10]: This is to take off the table of papers 21-631, 21-631, and 22-023 by Councilor Collins.

1438
02:05:31,383 --> 02:05:32,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

1439
02:05:34,344 --> 02:05:34,704
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

1440
02:05:35,904 --> 02:05:37,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Second from President Moran.

1441
02:05:37,305 --> 02:05:38,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1442
02:05:41,306 --> 02:05:41,746
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello.

1443
02:05:44,224 --> 02:05:44,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

1444
02:05:45,465 --> 02:05:45,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1445
02:05:46,286 --> 02:05:46,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1446
02:05:46,987 --> 02:05:47,167
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1447
02:05:51,172 --> 02:05:51,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1448
02:05:52,133 --> 02:05:52,313
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1449
02:05:56,637 --> 02:05:57,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

1450
02:05:57,358 --> 02:05:57,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1451
02:05:59,140 --> 02:05:59,721
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morell.

1452
02:06:00,261 --> 02:06:00,522
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1453
02:06:02,524 --> 02:06:03,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Payne.

1454
02:06:03,505 --> 02:06:03,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1455
02:06:04,126 --> 02:06:06,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Five in favor of the negative the motion passes.

1456
02:06:07,490 --> 02:06:36,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Paper 21-631 was passed by this council for first reading on December 21st, 2021, in regards to the positions of the administrative support for COVID-19, the COVID-19 public information officer, the federal funds manager, and parts of amendments L and M.

1457
02:06:39,517 --> 02:06:46,639
[SPEAKER_10]: which I believe were for amendment L, the data analyst and the contact.

1458
02:06:49,539 --> 02:06:55,261
[SPEAKER_10]: And for amendment M, the emergency preparedness coordinator, I believe.

1459
02:06:58,902 --> 02:06:59,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Councilor Caraviello.

1460
02:07:00,182 --> 02:07:00,902
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a-

1461
02:07:09,534 --> 02:07:11,555
[SPEAKER_10]: We can look at that paper after we look at these papers.

1462
02:07:12,996 --> 02:07:13,997
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't necessarily agree with that.

1463
02:07:15,418 --> 02:07:18,019
[SPEAKER_11]: It's our point of information is our point of personal privilege.

1464
02:07:18,139 --> 02:07:25,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Ultimately, the paper that they have before me is asking whether or not the papers that we're going to be voting on that we just taken from the table are in compliance with the general laws.

1465
02:07:27,321 --> 02:07:36,010
[SPEAKER_11]: So if this paper wouldn't be moved, and we take a vote, and then the vote says that we're not in compliance with the general laws, I think it was a situation.

1466
02:07:36,170 --> 02:07:37,952
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's just my understanding of this.

1467
02:07:38,573 --> 02:07:48,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And looking at the way that positions have been created and the way positions have been funded, I think we have a significant financial transparency issue, and I think we have a significant financial compliance issue.

1468
02:07:49,028 --> 02:07:57,235
[SPEAKER_11]: especially with chapter 44 section 33a related to the human resource directors position and potentially these as well that are outlined in this paper and that's why I raised the question.

1469
02:07:57,676 --> 02:07:59,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody behind this rail took an oath.

1470
02:07:59,497 --> 02:08:05,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Part of that oath was to uphold the rules of the constitution, the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the ordinances of the city of Medford.

1471
02:08:06,403 --> 02:08:11,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think anybody behind this rail can answer the question as to whether or not the city of Medford is in compliance with chapter 44 section 33a.

1472
02:08:13,356 --> 02:08:15,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Quite frankly, I don't think our CFO can answer that question.

1473
02:08:16,418 --> 02:08:22,381
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do raise the question because if I'm going to be taking a vote and putting my name on it, I want that vote to be in line with the oath I took.

1474
02:08:22,722 --> 02:08:24,362
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why I've asked for this paper to come first.

1475
02:08:25,123 --> 02:08:36,970
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't be supporting the three papers that are before me this evening because this paper, I think, addresses a lot of the questions that have been raised over duration relative to the compensation adjustment factor system and the approach that the administration is taking.

1476
02:08:38,444 --> 02:08:39,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1477
02:08:39,644 --> 02:08:46,826
[SPEAKER_10]: On the paper, 21-631, personnel ordinance amendments K and O and parts amendments L and M. Is there a motion on the floor?

1478
02:08:54,067 --> 02:08:54,647
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion to approve.

1479
02:08:56,107 --> 02:08:57,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve from President Morell.

1480
02:08:57,528 --> 02:08:58,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by?

1481
02:09:00,428 --> 02:09:00,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

1482
02:09:01,008 --> 02:09:02,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Collins.

1483
02:09:02,569 --> 02:09:03,269
[SPEAKER_10]: Any further discussion?

1484
02:09:05,622 --> 02:09:07,463
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an ordinance for third reading.

1485
02:09:07,503 --> 02:09:08,944
[SPEAKER_11]: It will need five votes for passage.

1486
02:09:09,024 --> 02:09:16,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Failure to pass will result in the paper being tabled for a period of 90 days and not being able to be reintroduced.

1487
02:09:16,886 --> 02:09:17,546
[SPEAKER_11]: What role is that?

1488
02:09:17,967 --> 02:09:18,947
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an ordinance.

1489
02:09:19,187 --> 02:09:20,487
[SPEAKER_11]: An ordinance is required five votes.

1490
02:09:20,727 --> 02:09:22,368
[SPEAKER_11]: So if this doesn't pass, then it fails.

1491
02:09:22,448 --> 02:09:24,049
[SPEAKER_11]: And if the paper fails, it's been disposed of.

1492
02:09:24,089 --> 02:09:27,710
[SPEAKER_11]: And if it's disposed of, the paper can't be reintroduced to the council for a period of 90 days.

1493
02:09:28,110 --> 02:09:30,631
[SPEAKER_10]: Ordinance is required five votes pursuant to what?

1494
02:09:30,851 --> 02:09:31,531
[SPEAKER_10]: State general law.

1495
02:09:32,091 --> 02:09:33,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Which chapter, section?

1496
02:09:33,272 --> 02:09:33,352
[SPEAKER_11]: It's 44.

1497
02:09:35,009 --> 02:09:35,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Look at this chapter 44.

1498
02:09:35,630 --> 02:09:40,556
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we're gonna take a minute to look at this.

1499
02:09:40,576 --> 02:09:43,861
[SPEAKER_11]: If we had legal counsel, it'd be like this.

1500
02:09:46,604 --> 02:09:48,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, they were passed for first reading, so.

1501
02:09:49,188 --> 02:09:50,730
[SPEAKER_11]: You need four to take off effectively.

1502
02:10:16,462 --> 02:10:18,223
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have a specific chapter or section.

1503
02:10:18,323 --> 02:10:19,203
[SPEAKER_11]: It's chapter 44.

1504
02:10:19,423 --> 02:10:23,926
[SPEAKER_11]: It'd be around section 18 or 20.

1505
02:10:24,366 --> 02:10:28,908
[SPEAKER_11]: I think section 22 has to do with the financial paper being tabled initially.

1506
02:10:31,529 --> 02:10:33,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Section 134, administration of government.

1507
02:10:33,570 --> 02:10:35,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Chapter 43 is for finance.

1508
02:10:35,031 --> 02:10:41,774
[SPEAKER_11]: Off hand, no. But I know I'm right.

1509
02:10:49,667 --> 02:10:52,388
[SPEAKER_11]: Would somebody like to call President Demeritus, Robert Mayorko?

1510
02:10:52,408 --> 02:11:02,254
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe the vote's been called.

1511
02:11:03,094 --> 02:11:04,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1512
02:11:04,895 --> 02:11:09,758
[SPEAKER_10]: My ruling is that it's an order with four votes, so unless there's a motion to count, my ruling is to chair.

1513
02:11:10,818 --> 02:11:15,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to review this before we do that, though, if folks would indulge me.

1514
02:11:24,311 --> 02:11:29,215
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not challenging the ruling of the chair.

1515
02:11:38,641 --> 02:11:48,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm just going to, you know, considering that I don't have the specific citation and I don't want to delay the proceedings, the ruling of the chair is that the vote- Would we not want to err on the side of caution, considering we've taken an oath?

1516
02:11:48,729 --> 02:11:51,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, considering that this council, you know,

1517
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:58,593
[SPEAKER_10]: worked in good faith to delay for a week and now have a motion under suspension.

1518
02:12:02,395 --> 02:12:04,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Perpetuating further delay, I'd like to vote.

1519
02:12:06,477 --> 02:12:07,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Waste makes waste.

1520
02:12:35,865 --> 02:12:37,966
[SPEAKER_10]: We move forward with the vote, Mr. please call the roll.

1521
02:12:45,771 --> 02:12:46,452
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a curvy all.

1522
02:12:49,374 --> 02:12:50,034
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a college.

1523
02:12:50,194 --> 02:12:50,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1524
02:12:53,056 --> 02:12:53,536
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a night.

1525
02:12:56,798 --> 02:12:58,139
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a compelling note.

1526
02:13:08,203 --> 02:13:08,783
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morell.

1527
02:13:09,464 --> 02:13:09,704
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1528
02:13:12,165 --> 02:13:12,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Ferris.

1529
02:13:12,966 --> 02:13:15,107
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, for the affirmative, three in the negative motion passes.

1530
02:13:15,127 --> 02:13:27,354
[SPEAKER_10]: 21-631, personal ordinance amendments FIJ and parts of amendment L and M. Motion of council, I do question the role of the chair as to whether the amendment passes.

1531
02:13:27,854 --> 02:13:28,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by.

1532
02:13:28,434 --> 02:13:28,894
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

1533
02:13:29,134 --> 02:13:30,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1534
02:13:30,295 --> 02:13:31,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1535
02:13:32,877 --> 02:13:33,437
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President.

1536
02:13:34,497 --> 02:13:35,318
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, President Morell.

1537
02:13:35,748 --> 02:13:37,990
[SPEAKER_22]: I do see Chief of Staff Nazarian has her hand up.

1538
02:13:38,290 --> 02:13:41,633
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if that would be helpful.

1539
02:13:41,653 --> 02:13:42,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, Madam Chief of Staff.

1540
02:13:44,455 --> 02:13:45,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1541
02:13:45,556 --> 02:13:46,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

1542
02:13:47,478 --> 02:13:55,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankly, I'm not certain of the answer to the question but I think Councilor Knight presents an interesting question that may be worthwhile.

1543
02:13:56,414 --> 02:14:14,220
[SPEAKER_02]: holding off to determine the, to confirm, I have no reason to doubt Councilor Knight on his knowledge of the mass general law in this arena, but I admittedly don't have the answer and I would also probably recommend

1544
02:14:16,501 --> 02:14:27,466
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting until we have an answer on that matter to ensure that these positions can move forward with the goal of the positions moving forward.

1545
02:14:29,207 --> 02:14:32,648
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to challenge the ruling of the chair, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1546
02:14:32,708 --> 02:14:33,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1547
02:14:44,273 --> 02:14:44,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello?

1548
02:14:44,814 --> 02:14:44,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1549
02:14:46,633 --> 02:14:47,253
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins.

1550
02:14:47,953 --> 02:14:48,373
[SPEAKER_28]: Present.

1551
02:14:55,755 --> 02:14:56,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1552
02:14:56,215 --> 02:14:56,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1553
02:15:00,076 --> 02:15:00,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1554
02:15:01,256 --> 02:15:01,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1555
02:15:02,877 --> 02:15:03,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng.

1556
02:15:05,557 --> 02:15:06,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Present.

1557
02:15:09,098 --> 02:15:09,638
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morell.

1558
02:15:10,885 --> 02:15:16,688
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm gonna note that I'm going to vote yes for this just because this is a paper that was brought forward by the administration.

1559
02:15:16,768 --> 02:15:31,357
[SPEAKER_22]: And since they're noting their own willingness and desire to take a beat to review this, I think that that makes sense if that is their wish and they are the folks who delivered this paper.

1560
02:15:32,218 --> 02:15:34,319
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's my reason for voting yes for this.

1561
02:15:38,649 --> 02:15:39,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Farris.

1562
02:15:39,469 --> 02:15:41,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1563
02:15:41,310 --> 02:15:42,270
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair is overruled.

1564
02:15:44,271 --> 02:15:55,294
[SPEAKER_10]: My reason, as Councilor Morell, if the sponsor of the paper does not want to move forward, then I'm comfortable keeping this or reverting, you know, if there's a motion to put these back on the table.

1565
02:15:59,195 --> 02:16:04,677
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1566
02:16:04,797 --> 02:16:05,998
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight could use his microphone.

1567
02:16:09,229 --> 02:16:25,036
[SPEAKER_11]: To permit a member voting present when the motion order resolution under consideration by the council forbid his or her participation as the conflict interest of law directs such members should do so should should so address the council in the chair and for me as to why the counselor is voting president present.

1568
02:16:27,321 --> 02:16:32,148
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think there's anything in here that says you can vote present unless I think you have to vote unless you have a conflict of interest.

1569
02:16:32,569 --> 02:16:36,975
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a rule in there and I think that that's not it, as I look at it, but from what I understand.

1570
02:16:38,838 --> 02:16:42,644
[SPEAKER_10]: So no, I certainly would have appreciated that to be brought up on the previous resolution.

1571
02:16:43,264 --> 02:16:44,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not the chair.

1572
02:16:44,084 --> 02:16:44,664
[SPEAKER_10]: You are, man.

1573
02:16:44,724 --> 02:16:45,545
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not the chair.

1574
02:16:45,625 --> 02:16:47,025
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand.

1575
02:16:47,065 --> 02:16:47,845
[SPEAKER_10]: It happened.

1576
02:16:47,925 --> 02:16:48,585
[SPEAKER_11]: It happened again.

1577
02:16:48,605 --> 02:16:49,925
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want me to do?

1578
02:16:49,985 --> 02:16:50,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1579
02:16:51,326 --> 02:16:52,326
[SPEAKER_09]: The vote is overturned.

1580
02:16:52,346 --> 02:16:53,706
[SPEAKER_09]: The vote is overturned.

1581
02:16:54,106 --> 02:16:55,106
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why we're discussing it.

1582
02:16:55,166 --> 02:16:56,187
[SPEAKER_09]: A vote has been taken already.

1583
02:16:56,647 --> 02:16:58,927
[SPEAKER_10]: It was just over the vote challenge.

1584
02:16:58,967 --> 02:16:59,807
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no vote.

1585
02:16:59,827 --> 02:17:01,308
[SPEAKER_10]: So the item remains on the agenda.

1586
02:17:01,328 --> 02:17:03,868
[SPEAKER_10]: The ruling of the chair was overturned and the vote was not in the affirmative.

1587
02:17:04,568 --> 02:17:05,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor?

1588
02:17:05,889 --> 02:17:09,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have to vote to, I'm not saying, do we have to rescind?

1589
02:17:09,729 --> 02:17:12,710
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not.

1590
02:17:13,352 --> 02:17:14,873
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we voted on nothing.

1591
02:17:15,033 --> 02:17:16,294
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair was incorrect.

1592
02:17:17,795 --> 02:17:19,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a motion on the floor regarding these items?

1593
02:17:24,219 --> 02:17:26,661
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to table items 21-631, 21-631, and 22-023 by Councilor Knight.

1594
02:17:26,741 --> 02:17:27,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by?

1595
02:17:27,081 --> 02:17:28,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1596
02:17:28,061 --> 02:17:29,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1597
02:17:40,202 --> 02:17:44,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to table all three, they were taken off the table and I motion to put them back on the table.

1598
02:17:48,864 --> 02:17:49,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello?

1599
02:17:50,044 --> 02:17:50,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1600
02:17:51,605 --> 02:17:52,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Collins?

1601
02:17:52,385 --> 02:17:52,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1602
02:17:53,745 --> 02:17:54,245
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight?

1603
02:17:54,265 --> 02:17:55,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1604
02:17:55,486 --> 02:17:56,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1605
02:17:56,506 --> 02:17:56,746
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1606
02:17:57,086 --> 02:17:57,686
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Tseng?

1607
02:17:57,886 --> 02:17:58,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1608
02:17:59,247 --> 02:17:59,887
[SPEAKER_17]: President Morell?

1609
02:18:00,467 --> 02:18:00,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1610
02:18:01,747 --> 02:18:02,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Bears?

1611
02:18:03,268 --> 02:18:05,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm gonna affirm a zero and a negative, the motions are tabled.

1612
02:18:06,968 --> 02:18:07,749
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello?

1613
02:18:21,084 --> 02:18:28,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Clerk, I mean, Mr. Councilor Caraviello, you're free to file that as an item on the agenda next week.

1614
02:18:34,590 --> 02:18:36,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caraviello could use his microphone.

1615
02:18:36,351 --> 02:18:39,452
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1616
02:18:39,612 --> 02:18:42,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need a legal opinion by tomorrow morning.

1617
02:18:48,444 --> 02:18:52,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if that stands, that bill dies in 90 days.

1618
02:18:54,206 --> 02:18:55,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't come back in 90 days.

1619
02:18:55,207 --> 02:18:58,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would get a legal, if I were you, I'd be getting a legal opinion first thing in the morning.

1620
02:19:10,833 --> 02:19:14,795
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be happy to move for reconsideration should the paper come back requiring five votes.

1621
02:19:15,135 --> 02:19:15,375

02:22:31,782 --> 02:22:34,022
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a public participation paper that has no number.

1702
02:22:34,082 --> 02:22:37,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So the clerk has the authority to include it on the agenda next week.

1703
02:22:38,044 --> 02:22:40,084
[SPEAKER_11]: The council doesn't take action on those papers anyway.

1704
02:22:40,104 --> 02:22:41,044
[SPEAKER_11]: We just sit there and listen, right?

1705
02:22:41,064 --> 02:22:44,905
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it's up to us to take an action on it the next week, the following week to comply with OML.

1706
02:22:44,945 --> 02:22:46,206
[SPEAKER_11]: So the clerk can just reissue that.

1707
02:22:47,526 --> 02:22:47,746
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1708
02:22:47,786 --> 02:22:53,568
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, Mr. Petrella asked just that it be on for next week if the clerk is so obliged to leave that on.

1709
02:22:56,445 --> 02:23:00,266
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, then, any other business before the council?

1710
02:23:00,306 --> 02:23:00,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

1711
02:23:01,166 --> 02:23:02,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Caraviello.

1712
02:23:02,226 --> 02:23:03,326
[SPEAKER_09]: I have two things.

1713
02:23:04,087 --> 02:23:11,368
[SPEAKER_09]: First, President Morell, the people from Woburn and High have reached out.

1714
02:23:11,388 --> 02:23:14,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Their problem has been exasperated.

1715
02:23:14,869 --> 02:23:20,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you set a date for that meeting with DOT and everybody?

1716
02:23:20,876 --> 02:23:37,226
[SPEAKER_22]: I, we had a date and then we could only get a Tuesday date from the Department of Transportation so let me follow up because that your recommendation, a Wednesday day to allow more open ended so I'll follow up first thing we could do any Monday, Tuesday, Monday or Thursday if you need to.

1717
02:23:38,082 --> 02:23:46,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think these people have a problem, but with the snow that happened and all the rain over the past week, their problem has grown.

1718
02:23:46,548 --> 02:23:50,191
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could expedite that, they would be appreciative.

1719
02:23:50,871 --> 02:23:57,796
[SPEAKER_09]: And my last thing is DPW Foreman Tanaglia reached out to me this afternoon.

1720
02:23:57,816 --> 02:24:04,061
[SPEAKER_09]: As many of us who have been driving around the streets, look like we're driving around a bomb zone.

1721
02:24:04,650 --> 02:24:05,470
[SPEAKER_09]: There's holes everywhere.

1722
02:24:06,311 --> 02:24:10,793
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have any holes you're looking to patch, call DPW, they're gonna have trucks out in the next couple of days.

1723
02:24:10,813 --> 02:24:14,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Off-road holes.

1724
02:24:14,954 --> 02:24:16,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them will fit your car in there.

1725
02:24:17,755 --> 02:24:25,399
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you have a hole or you see one, call DPW, report it, and they'll do the best to get it filled as soon as possible.

1726
02:24:25,959 --> 02:24:27,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1727
02:24:28,600 --> 02:24:29,280
