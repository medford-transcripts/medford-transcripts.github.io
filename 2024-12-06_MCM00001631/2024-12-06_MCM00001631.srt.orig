1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:05,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But we still have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, giving us exactly a quorum.

2
00:00:06,939 --> 00:00:07,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a guest or two.

4
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:16,930
[SPEAKER_02]: If they'd like to introduce themselves, I want to give them the opportunity to do so.

5
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Name, pronouns, who they're representing, if anyone.

6
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:33,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fantastic.

7
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:37,530
[SPEAKER_02]: In that case, has everyone had a chance to review the minutes from our October meeting?

8
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:47,752
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, any notes, any amendments, anything come to mind?

9
00:00:53,034 --> 00:00:53,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none.

10
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:59,246
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know if it affects the voting on the minutes, but I wasn't there last meeting.

11
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:00,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I have to abstain.

12
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:02,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know if that changes the quorum.

13
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:05,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Same for me.

14
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:07,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Same for me too.

15
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:09,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it affects the quorum so much as.

17
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,231
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that do?

18
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:17,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

19
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:24,394
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needs majority to pass majority of the quorum of the people who show up.

20
00:01:25,195 --> 00:01:28,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I think we'll be in the clear, but still just barely.

21
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll.

22
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I see any motions relating to the minutes?

23
00:01:36,347 --> 00:01:40,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't move to accept the minutes.

24
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:41,473
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Bob.

25
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can second them.

26
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:47,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I can second.

27
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:48,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

28
00:01:48,327 --> 00:01:49,268
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't make a motion.

29
00:01:50,028 --> 00:01:50,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

30
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:50,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

31
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:56,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I will second that and we'll go right to voting to accept the minutes.

32
00:01:57,734 --> 00:01:58,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Going down the list.

33
00:01:58,794 --> 00:01:59,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Benji.

34
00:01:59,455 --> 00:01:59,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Accept.

35
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:01,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Loretta, James.

36
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,901
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll abstain because I wasn't at the meeting.

37
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:09,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Fair enough.

38
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:12,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathleen McKenna.

39
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:13,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

40
00:02:17,214 --> 00:02:19,035
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Dan, Bob Payne?

41
00:02:19,495 --> 00:02:19,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

42
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:22,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Jessica Parks?

43
00:02:23,717 --> 00:02:24,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to abstain.

44
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:28,619
[SPEAKER_02]: John Rogers?

45
00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:29,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Abstain.

46
00:02:31,961 --> 00:02:32,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill Sherwood?

47
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:33,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll accept them.

48
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

49
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:41,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, just barely, I believe.

50
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:44,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll accept these minutes.

51
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Four yeas, three abstains.

52
00:02:50,903 --> 00:02:56,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can move on to some more pressing issues relating to this month.

53
00:02:57,409 --> 00:02:59,892
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to throw it over to Brenda.

54
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:05,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you have a bit of a cold, so we'll take it easy on you, but do you have any updates for us?

55
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:10,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we 1st, talk about the December meeting?

56
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:18,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking for if we want to have any additional co chairs or add any additional members.

57
00:03:19,814 --> 00:03:21,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's a great point.

58
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:25,077
[SPEAKER_02]: As you noticed, attendance is a little sparse.

59
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:38,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We also had an email come in earlier today from Martha Andrus saying that she'll be stepping away from this committee.

60
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:51,251
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'd like to discuss potential of adding additional members, see if anyone else would like to assist in co-chairing alongside me, if there's any interest in that.

61
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hold a couple minutes to speak to this.

62
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone feel, I'll start with this.

63
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:09,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anyone feel strongly about not adding any new members?

64
00:04:12,969 --> 00:04:13,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is Bob.

65
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:18,814
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can certainly get up to where we were before and up to two.

66
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:28,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if, Brenda, you know of any resumes that have come in of interest for, you know, expressing interest in joining the committee.

67
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:33,812
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a few come in over the last year.

68
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:43,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I've told them is just to, if they're interested to attend some of the meetings and see what they're like.

69
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:48,600
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them actually was the person who came to speak about zero waste.

70
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:52,616
[SPEAKER_03]: she was interested in joining the committee.

71
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:55,978
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have some more who came in as well.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:10,924
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have multiple candidates, how do we decide if we have more than we want to add?

73
00:05:11,985 --> 00:05:15,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Who actually makes that decision?

74
00:05:15,446 --> 00:05:16,647
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the committee does.

75
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:30,874
[SPEAKER_02]: My recollection, there was someone who was working for the city had interviewed me and moved me along, at least.

76
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I remember them being, I think, a UEP student from Tufts, so I don't know.

77
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:39,185
[SPEAKER_02]: just how many steps there are.

78
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,885
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the PDS interns, possibly.

79
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:58,629
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think what we would do is I would reach out to them to see if they're still interested, because some of these were months ago that they said they were interested, and just have a conversation with them.

80
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:04,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think we would make recommendations to the mayor

81
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:31,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we, maybe the committee ought to maybe provide some, I don't know, recommendations or opinions as to what talents or background would be useful, most useful, or maybe Brenda, you know already.

82
00:06:34,392 --> 00:06:41,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the zero waste issue is interesting and I don't know if we have any expertise.

83
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:48,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly I'm not an expert and I'm supposed to talk about it, but someone who has more experience would be useful in that regard.

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,961
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, just one example.

85
00:06:55,603 --> 00:07:03,307
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be nice to know, I don't know if we need to know, but if there's a list of

86
00:07:05,277 --> 00:07:09,943
[SPEAKER_01]: background attributes for the candidates.

87
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:17,511
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be interesting to know, but I don't know if we've ever been involved in that process before.

88
00:07:23,452 --> 00:07:23,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

89
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:25,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of diversity in the city.

90
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:34,751
[SPEAKER_08]: So there could be backgrounds like, you know, maybe someone doesn't have a direct energy or environmental background, but they have a really good, like,

91
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:51,809
[SPEAKER_08]: let's say like a procedural background or other backgrounds that we could use, maybe a public speaking background or something that would be useful to the committee, but not directly useful as far as energy or environment, right?

92
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:59,356
[SPEAKER_08]: So we probably have to kind of vet the candidates one at a time that way.

93
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:14,875
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting, just a few years back before COVID, we used to have a process where we would also reach out to people ourselves, the Energy Committee members.

94
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:23,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the older members, well, not older, but members that have been on the committee a while would remember that.

95
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:31,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would reach out to candidates and they would submit applications to the office or sometimes,

96
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:36,385
[SPEAKER_06]: the office would get applications and we would review them.

97
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:42,990
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we would decide as a group with the city before they'd go to the mayor.

98
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's changed over the years.

99
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,934
[SPEAKER_06]: They just go to the city and they get placed with us.

100
00:08:48,714 --> 00:08:51,917
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be something to deliberate on.

101
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:58,641
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely like the idea of taking recommendations.

102
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:09,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, pushing people to apply is definitely a better start, because I don't know how many applications you receive, but I know I learned about this sort of on a whim.

103
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:13,454
[SPEAKER_02]: It was luck of the draw more than anything that got me started.

104
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,669
[SPEAKER_06]: I can think of a few people to ask, but I don't want to overstep the office since it's changed.

105
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nominating is going to be different than hiring.

106
00:09:27,014 --> 00:09:31,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I think telling them they should apply is a great thing.

107
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:39,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.

108
00:09:39,386 --> 00:10:00,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the goal should be to reach out to folks that you think might be interested and just that they apply before the next meeting so that we have a chance to look at the experiences of the people who have already applied at that point.

109
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,158
[SPEAKER_06]: But the next meeting is in a couple,

110
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,288
[SPEAKER_02]: It is pretty soon.

111
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's really soon.

112
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it like one, two, three weeks from now?

113
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,991
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty soon.

114
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so maybe January would be a better choice.

115
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:27,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think they need some time to think about it and then maybe speak with you, Brenda, and some of them may come to a meeting.

116
00:10:29,556 --> 00:10:32,997
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can think of some people that are involved in

117
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:41,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Gardening and invasive plants and have a background in horticulture.

118
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:48,043
[SPEAKER_06]: That might be interested, which would add to some of our focus focusing on invasive plants and.

119
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:52,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Planting pollinator gardens and things like that.

120
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,086
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great idea.

121
00:10:57,947 --> 00:10:59,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think if we could generate.

122
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:03,369
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of new applications to to begin parsing through.

123
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:06,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I think right now, we just don't have a whole lot of choices.

124
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:08,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it's important that we.

125
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,203
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought in that pool and then we'll have a lot of people to choose from and I think that'll be really good for us.

126
00:11:14,784 --> 00:11:15,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

127
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:16,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

128
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:18,025
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's okay.

129
00:11:18,046 --> 00:11:18,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

130
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:21,948
[SPEAKER_04]: There is someone who I know.

131
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:27,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Who I met on the.

132
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:32,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Recently, who works for FEMA who.

133
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,919
[SPEAKER_04]: is interested in joining as well.

134
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:43,101
[SPEAKER_04]: She was gonna fill out the form online and she was going to try and come to today's meeting.

135
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:53,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually just sent her a message to see if she was gonna sit in as well, but she has expressed interest in this group.

136
00:11:55,526 --> 00:11:56,566
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be interesting.

137
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Although right now she's slightly worried about her.

138
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,033
[SPEAKER_04]: The future of FEMA, but, you know, that's 11.

139
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:10,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I totally understand.

140
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, how many members do we have?

141
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:20,585
[SPEAKER_02]: We have as of today, we have 12 members.

142
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:24,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, although.

143
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:32,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there are a few folks I haven't seen in a while, but we have 12 listed committee members.

144
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:35,736
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have an ideal number?

145
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:36,456
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a target?

146
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:41,578
[SPEAKER_02]: We were at 13, and I think that gives us an easy quorum to meet.

147
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:44,299
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at 14, actually.

148
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,160
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 14 before.

149
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,040
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Sarah.

150
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:56,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we still had a quorum of seven, so that was good.

151
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:06,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we could get back to, we could add two and assuming we continue with the current 12, that would get us back to 14.

152
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:15,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Having an odd number kind of prevents deadlock votes, but it doesn't really matter because, you know, it works on quorum.

153
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:24,967
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have like, you know, on any particular day, whatever members you have, you know, so, so I don't think that's as important as it sounds.

154
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:33,206
[SPEAKER_02]: And given the variation we see in attendance month to month.

155
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:37,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I think more members is generally better.

156
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:42,368
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sense that if we had another odd night, like, tonight be nice to have.

157
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:47,129
[SPEAKER_02]: 8, 9, 10 people rather than than 7.

158
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:50,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we only stand to benefit from a bigger pool.

159
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:53,053
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine with that.

160
00:13:53,073 --> 00:14:00,979
[SPEAKER_00]: My only concern is inviting people to apply when we don't have a lot of spaces and then turn people down and have everybody wasted the time and effort to get there.

161
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:02,540
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only concern I was expressing.

162
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:08,864
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

163
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,689
[SPEAKER_01]: So Brenda, how many of you said we had a

164
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:27,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you should recycle or revisit the people who would express interest and maybe let us know how many candidates there are already.

165
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:34,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can do that before the next meeting.

166
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:48,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I'll reach out to the folks who expressed interest in the past, like I said, because if they expressed interest six months ago, they might not actually be interested anymore.

167
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:53,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll reach out to them and then we can see how many we have on that list now.

168
00:14:56,086 --> 00:15:01,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, maybe we can revisit this whole thing December 2nd as to whether we have to reach out further.

169
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:07,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Go from there and I wonder, you know, have they attended any meetings?

170
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:17,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think giving folks the opportunity to join us maybe for our December meeting.

171
00:15:17,754 --> 00:15:21,775
[SPEAKER_02]: If they are interested, whether or not they've even applied just to say, hey, you should sit in.

172
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:26,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's truly no reason not to have people here.

173
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So, giving them a taste of what we do is is helpful.

174
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:36,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can start to deliberate further on how many seats are actually open.

175
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:45,415
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are voices that need to be heard that need to be on our in the room when we, when we have these meetings, we can start to discuss that.

176
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,102
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to just get that on everyone's radar.

177
00:15:55,624 --> 00:15:59,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure we're thinking about it and we can begin that process.

178
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:00,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So December 2nd.

179
00:16:01,108 --> 00:16:04,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell your friends interested to to join us on that day.

180
00:16:07,072 --> 00:16:09,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I think will be a good starting point.

181
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:33,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we should also inform people for the next meeting that they should express any interest in being a co-chair so that we can actually revisit that agenda item next month.

182
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:35,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

183
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm learning to love the co-chair lifestyle.

184
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to have a friend to do it with, though.

185
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:51,478
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if anyone's feeling brave, feeling bold, it'd be nice to share in this joy.

186
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,161
[SPEAKER_02]: So, something for all of you to think about.

187
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll relay it to the rest of the committee as well.

188
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,071
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

189
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:18,635
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, unless there are any other pressing concerns, thoughts, before we move on, I'd like to turn it over to Brenda.

190
00:17:20,766 --> 00:17:21,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

191
00:17:21,627 --> 00:17:26,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And I apologize for my voice, I'm sick and it's, it's my voice is not great.

192
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,118
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's see electrify Medford.

193
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:35,424
[SPEAKER_03]: We applied for the massive community first partnership.

194
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:44,150
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a three-year program where we work closely with National Grid to do outreach about the Mass Save program.

195
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:59,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of what we're doing already with Electrify Medford, but with this, we would get monthly updates from them about their incentives, but also data about what measures have been installed in Medford.

196
00:18:01,203 --> 00:18:04,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be able to do bill inserts through their utility bills.

197
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:08,224
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be really good.

198
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:20,407
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we've written into that, having our economic development planner work with me to do small business outreach about the Mass Save incentives.

199
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:26,988
[SPEAKER_03]: So sort of expanding what we have been doing for electrifying Medford to small businesses too.

200
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:34,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so far 92 people have signed up and 26 have been coached.

201
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:54,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've done, we did a bunch of events in the last month, including a bilingual story time at the library, the last farmer's market of the year, the harvest your energy festival and the pumpkin smash at the West Medford community center.

202
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:59,266
[SPEAKER_03]: which I was really surprised at the number of people who go through that.

203
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:07,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And then coming up, there's a winter preparedness event tomorrow night at City Hall.

204
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:16,838
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, excuse me, winter extravaganza on December 4th.

205
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:22,562
[SPEAKER_03]: And there will be an Electrify Medford event at the library on January 16th.

206
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:35,893
[SPEAKER_03]: For the community electricity aggregation, letters went out to residents about the new pricing.

207
00:19:37,694 --> 00:19:39,856
[SPEAKER_03]: So starting with the December billing cycle, the

208
00:19:42,838 --> 00:19:49,621
[SPEAKER_03]: rates are going to go down about one cent per kilowatt hour for the default rate that we have.

209
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:55,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And the renewable energy content is going up to 10% additional.

210
00:19:55,923 --> 00:20:03,706
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a lot of calls after those letters went out, mostly people who are already on the aggregation who think they have to sign up again.

211
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:04,847
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't.

212
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:09,169
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're on the aggregation, they'll automatically be rolled into the new pricing.

213
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,790
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've also come across people

214
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,851
[SPEAKER_03]: who are on competitive suppliers.

215
00:20:15,391 --> 00:20:21,633
[SPEAKER_03]: One person this week was paying 28 cents per kilowatt hour, which was just ridiculous.

216
00:20:21,713 --> 00:20:26,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had no idea that it was so much higher than what they could have been having.

217
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:32,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if they got slammed into it.

218
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:40,318
[SPEAKER_03]: They knew that they had a competitive supplier, but I think there was an introductory rate, and they didn't realize it changed over.

219
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,671
[SPEAKER_01]: On that issue, yeah, my neighbor was saying, I got this letter, what do I have to do?

220
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:54,572
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of people, how did we get this letter?

221
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

222
00:20:58,573 --> 00:21:00,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing to worry about, if anything, that's good news.

223
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:07,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tell them to double check their electric bill to make sure that they're on the aggregation.

224
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:17,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, I'll have to check with her, but I think people were, I guess people, this didn't say, don't worry, you don't have to do anything.

225
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:24,948
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's good news, but I don't think the message is, I don't think I've ever gotten this letter before.

226
00:21:25,908 --> 00:21:32,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It does say that, but there's a lot of text on there, so I can see how people are, yeah.

227
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:37,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So did that go out to everybody, or just people who are already in the aggregation?

228
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:49,127
[SPEAKER_03]: That went out to everybody because we've been getting people who were on competitive suppliers.

229
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:58,956
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I noticed with my electric bill is I could tell that I was on the aggregation, because it says that, but I couldn't tell what my rate was.

230
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:02,759
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only way I could tell what my rate was is you put last year's rate in there.

231
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So I could see that my rate was equivalent to one of the last year rates.

232
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:09,244
[SPEAKER_08]: So I knew which tier I was on.

233
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:14,868
[SPEAKER_08]: But it'd be nice if the bill said you're on this tier.

234
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I went over my electric bill top to bottom, and it didn't show what rate.

235
00:22:22,068 --> 00:22:23,069
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't have the number.

236
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:28,756
[SPEAKER_08]: It said it had the number it had the so the letter that you sent out said it was like 15.36.

237
00:22:31,387 --> 00:22:33,948
[SPEAKER_08]: cents per kilowatt hour, 368, I think.

238
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:37,649
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I could look and see that that's what I was paying.

239
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,071
[SPEAKER_08]: But it didn't say, and it said that I was part of Massachusetts aggregation.

240
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:43,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I could see that.

241
00:22:43,611 --> 00:22:45,912
[SPEAKER_08]: But it didn't say what rate I was on the aggregation.

242
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:55,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it did say that as an electric company, I was a residential R1 rate, you know, from the electric company itself.

243
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:55,976
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know,

244
00:22:57,098 --> 00:23:00,984
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean what rate in terms of like the local green or the basic.

245
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:01,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

246
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:02,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

247
00:23:03,107 --> 00:23:03,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

248
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:03,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

249
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:07,593
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have control over what National Grid puts on the bill, unfortunately.

250
00:23:07,613 --> 00:23:07,653
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

251
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:08,053
[SPEAKER_03]: The number.

252
00:23:08,073 --> 00:23:08,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

253
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:29,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so if you have received that letter already and you have any feedback on the wording of it, it would be really great to get that.

254
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:39,430
[SPEAKER_03]: This is locked in for the next three years, so this isn't going to happen again for quite a while, but it would be good to just have that feedback so that we can keep it in mind for next time.

255
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:49,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it does say in fine print, no action is necessary to receive the new pricing for your current Bedford supply option.

256
00:23:50,392 --> 00:23:52,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you really look, you can find that wording.

257
00:23:54,894 --> 00:23:56,295
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of quotes on there.

258
00:23:56,976 --> 00:23:58,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff on there, yeah.

259
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

260
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.

261
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:08,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's good news because it's lower.

262
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:11,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

263
00:24:12,132 --> 00:24:14,754
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be surprised how many people still yell at me, though.

264
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:31,806
[SPEAKER_03]: When they yell, I'm mostly about unrelated things like the the override vote and things like that.

265
00:24:31,907 --> 00:24:32,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it your fault?

266
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:34,008
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

267
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:37,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's I'm like, I mean, I'm like, this is a lower rate.

268
00:24:37,951 --> 00:24:40,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, yeah, but you're taking it from me someplace else.

269
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:42,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, geez, wow.

270
00:24:42,517 --> 00:24:43,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, yeah, all right.

271
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:45,818
[SPEAKER_01]: You are, you personally are.

272
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:46,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.

273
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:47,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.

274
00:24:48,939 --> 00:24:56,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I saw there was $3.9 million that was saved over the last program, or $3.9 million that went through the last program.

275
00:24:57,923 --> 00:25:00,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more than that that was saved, actually.

276
00:25:00,844 --> 00:25:05,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, I think it was closer to five million.

277
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:06,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

278
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,508
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a lot of kilowatt hours.

279
00:25:12,828 --> 00:25:18,349
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a good post.

280
00:25:18,989 --> 00:25:31,193
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying that Manfred residents that chose the electric aggregation program, their national grid in the city, locked in that rate, saved almost $5 million?

281
00:25:33,034 --> 00:25:33,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you're saying?

282
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:39,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can pull it up here so I can have the exact number.

283
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,801
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have it in front of me.

284
00:25:41,821 --> 00:25:43,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I looked it over last night because we got the letter yesterday.

285
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:45,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get that.

286
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:46,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

287
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:47,547
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to look.

288
00:25:47,687 --> 00:25:49,049
[SPEAKER_08]: You might get it tomorrow, you know.

289
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:50,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.

290
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I've noticed that our mailman doesn't deliver mail every day.

291
00:25:53,494 --> 00:25:55,256
[SPEAKER_08]: He delivers like every other day.

292
00:25:55,276 --> 00:25:55,957
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

293
00:25:57,862 --> 00:26:05,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's $11 million saved since the program started back when the aggregation was first established.

294
00:26:05,904 --> 00:26:10,586
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a really good post, maybe on Go Green Medford, Brenda.

295
00:26:11,966 --> 00:26:14,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, that's important for residents to know.

296
00:26:14,587 --> 00:26:17,468
[SPEAKER_06]: The residents who chose to save $11 million.

297
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:18,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

298
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:21,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Include businesses too?

299
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Or were they not?

300
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:29,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Small businesses, large businesses can get cheaper rates elsewhere.

301
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:31,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, okay.

302
00:26:32,979 --> 00:26:36,303
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I saw $600 per participant average.

303
00:26:36,724 --> 00:26:38,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that over the program or over the year?

304
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:42,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That was over the year.

305
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:43,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

306
00:26:44,287 --> 00:26:44,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

307
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:54,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see, you know, the thing is, is you, you know how much you pay for electricity, but you don't know how much you could have paid for electricity.

308
00:26:54,472 --> 00:26:55,612
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't over the year.

309
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:59,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It was since December, 2022, when we last locked in pricing.

310
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:00,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

311
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:01,115
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

312
00:27:01,135 --> 00:27:01,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So over $200 saved.

313
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:01,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

314
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:02,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

315
00:27:02,336 --> 00:27:03,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

316
00:27:05,477 --> 00:27:06,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Still, Hey, you know,

317
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:13,939
[SPEAKER_08]: The price is locked in for three years, which is with everything going up.

318
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it surprising that the price went down.

319
00:27:19,864 --> 00:27:20,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I did too.

320
00:27:20,404 --> 00:27:22,786
[SPEAKER_03]: The timing really helps.

321
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:26,570
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a good consultant that we work with on this.

322
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:33,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, back in God, I think it was March.

323
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,104
[SPEAKER_03]: They reached out to us and said, actually, I think we should renew earlier than usual.

324
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:40,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Oh, okay.

325
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:42,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I sing is, is very good right now.

326
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

327
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:49,138
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's great.

328
00:27:54,057 --> 00:28:14,329
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think the only other thing I wanted to mention tonight is I submitted our annual report to green communities and our total energy use, that's buildings and city vehicles, so this is just for municipal energy use, is down 19% from our 2009 baseline.

329
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:15,770
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

330
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:27,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's 14.5% if you weather normalize that.

331
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of that is due to changes in the weather.

332
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:34,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

333
00:28:34,816 --> 00:28:43,962
[SPEAKER_02]: That's excellent.

334
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:49,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else or do you want to jump right into Harvest Your Energy Festival?

335
00:28:49,907 --> 00:28:51,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, that feels like ages ago now.

336
00:28:55,867 --> 00:29:04,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only feedback that I got directly about the festival was the need for more vegetarian and vegan options there.

337
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:14,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Kathleen.

338
00:29:17,752 --> 00:29:20,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Lois sent out that email.

339
00:29:20,353 --> 00:29:28,557
[SPEAKER_05]: I read through it and she suggested more things for the kids to eat, whether like, unfortunately, like candy.

340
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:31,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

341
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,880
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have children, but she commented on that.

342
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:42,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there as a Bob.

343
00:29:42,152 --> 00:29:45,614
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does it compare to other festivals?

344
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:46,935
[SPEAKER_01]: More attendance?

345
00:29:47,315 --> 00:29:49,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the weather was glorious.

346
00:29:52,979 --> 00:30:03,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was working the parking for the electronics recycling, and I felt like this was the most, like we just had nonstop cars the whole time.

347
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:06,668
[SPEAKER_08]: So I felt that there was a lot of recycling going.

348
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:09,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But I couldn't tell about attendance to the fair itself.

349
00:30:13,127 --> 00:30:20,390
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely felt like it was more than previous years, but it was hard to tell because the playground had been redesigned.

350
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:25,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So you didn't have the same sort of canvas that you were looking at.

351
00:30:25,832 --> 00:30:26,713
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

352
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:34,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the flow is definitely different because of the way it was set up.

353
00:30:34,896 --> 00:30:36,417
[SPEAKER_04]: So it didn't seem as

354
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:41,127
[SPEAKER_04]: crowded or everything was all in one place.

355
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:46,673
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I was standing at the front, there was a constant stream of people moving past me.

356
00:30:47,254 --> 00:30:50,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, it seemed like it was well-intended.

357
00:30:57,124 --> 00:30:59,246
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the playground is set up,

358
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:03,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I think you don't get as much foot traffic past the wind turbine.

359
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think we didn't have as many people going over for the wind turbine tours.

360
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:10,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's true.

361
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:23,902
[SPEAKER_03]: But we did have people walking sort of in that direction to go to the electric vehicle showcase and for the food, but there was still some distance away from it.

362
00:31:26,173 --> 00:31:28,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So now Bob, did you open the turbine this year?

363
00:31:28,835 --> 00:31:29,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Could people look inside?

364
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:32,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't able to go because of a wedding event.

365
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:33,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.

366
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:36,161
[SPEAKER_01]: So I presume it was open.

367
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:44,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the person from Green Energy Consumers Alliance was able to probably do what I do because she's been there year after year.

368
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:45,868
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

369
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:47,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.

370
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had a table at the electric vehicle showcase.

371
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:55,576
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they were trying to sort of direct people over towards the wind turbine too.

372
00:31:57,412 --> 00:31:58,172
[SPEAKER_03]: from that table.

373
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:22,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we lucked out on the weather and maybe, I don't know if Octobers are gonna be dry and warm like they have been, but it seems like it's a good weekend year after year to pitch.

374
00:32:24,195 --> 00:32:24,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

375
00:32:24,756 --> 00:32:29,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Weekend after, right after Indigenous Peoples Day.

376
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:30,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

377
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:35,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I was over at the- One thing.

378
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:35,745
Shh.

379
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:36,866
[SPEAKER_07]: No, go for it.

380
00:32:37,698 --> 00:32:43,562
[SPEAKER_05]: I was over at the shredder, and people were definitely happy to have that there.

381
00:32:43,582 --> 00:32:47,244
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like less traffic there.

382
00:32:48,565 --> 00:32:54,568
[SPEAKER_05]: But like John said, there was a constant flow going through the parking lot.

383
00:32:55,189 --> 00:33:01,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing I noticed was, although it was better, I think,

384
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:11,978
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to have two lanes, one waiting for the recycling and then a second lane in case people need to get by to do something else.

385
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:23,204
[SPEAKER_05]: And we only had that snafu with the city's truck there that blocked us for a few little while before we could get them to move the truck.

386
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:25,505
[SPEAKER_05]: And also when they made that

387
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:27,706
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of U-turn.

388
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:36,593
[SPEAKER_05]: The second part of the U is where the, what was it, humidifier, dehumidifiers truck was.

389
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:46,762
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that should be moved because it took up too much of the turn and cars couldn't get by if someone was stopped there.

390
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,185
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my, yeah, it's funny.

391
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:59,369
[SPEAKER_08]: We had that issue like three years ago and we talked about it and we, and we remembered it and we kept it from happening last year, but then we forgot about it for this year.

392
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

393
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,831
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that right where the turn is, right.

394
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:10,254
[SPEAKER_05]: If you move it up a little closer to where the shredder is and maybe the shredder can move up a tiny bit.

395
00:34:11,974 --> 00:34:13,575
[SPEAKER_05]: But other than that, it was pretty smooth.

396
00:34:20,248 --> 00:34:26,871
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I wanted to bring up, we don't have to discuss, but just to get it on people's radar as well.

397
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:40,656
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was tabling our MEEC table for the better part of that event and basically just opened forum for people to discuss the things that were

398
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:48,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Bothering them or wanted to see changes within the realms of environment and energy in Medford.

399
00:34:49,604 --> 00:34:53,368
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a couple of very active folks coming from the trees Medford table.

400
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:59,213
[SPEAKER_02]: That were very, very excited about.

401
00:34:59,774 --> 00:35:03,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Different programs involving preserving our canopy and bettering our trees.

402
00:35:05,259 --> 00:35:14,964
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other really common one I saw a lot of, and it's fitting that Bob will be talking about it later tonight, was people talking about waste management.

403
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:22,348
[SPEAKER_02]: People wanted expanded recycling programs and textile recycling options.

404
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:24,209
[SPEAKER_02]: That became

405
00:35:25,269 --> 00:35:46,395
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the larger topics of discussion at our table, which was interesting and something that I was just taking note of and wanted to generally relay to you all as an issue that popped up and I found interesting and something maybe worth looking at more closely.

406
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:05,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

407
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other closing thoughts on the Harvester Energy Festival?

408
00:36:14,332 --> 00:36:19,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, Loretta, are you ready to tell us of any updates on Trees Medford?

409
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:22,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

410
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:24,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

411
00:36:25,997 --> 00:36:34,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Next Wednesday, November 20th, at 6 o'clock, the City Council Committee of the Whole will be meeting with

412
00:36:36,378 --> 00:36:41,342
[SPEAKER_06]: to discuss the tree ordinances that were presented by Trees Medford.

413
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:52,052
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to, it's on the city calendar under events, and it's a Zoom ID you can attend in person at six o'clock or by Zoom.

414
00:36:53,653 --> 00:36:57,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Now Trees Medford's next meeting is next Tuesday.

415
00:36:57,517 --> 00:37:03,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't able to attend their last meeting in October, but,

416
00:37:05,715 --> 00:37:15,798
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure, I didn't actually place a call to Amanda Bowen, but it was last minute early today, because I just found out about the meeting yesterday with the city council committee of the whole.

417
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:25,601
[SPEAKER_06]: So at their next meeting, Tree's Medford is next Tuesday at, I think it's at six.

418
00:37:25,741 --> 00:37:27,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, theirs is at six.

419
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:29,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they'll be talking about it.

420
00:37:29,482 --> 00:37:31,083
[SPEAKER_06]: If I hear anything, I'll email.

421
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Brenda and she can send it out to you.

422
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,981
[SPEAKER_06]: But those meetings are open to the public.

423
00:37:37,762 --> 00:37:49,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And since we had worked on advising Therese Medford on all three of the ordinances, actually, it would be good if some of our members join in.

424
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:51,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to be there.

425
00:37:51,207 --> 00:37:53,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll probably do Zoom.

426
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:56,870
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will let Luke know.

427
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:09,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess he had a big look with the only know about this, and I'll probably send an email out to remind people and Felicia also.

428
00:38:12,662 --> 00:38:20,327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure exactly the process, you know, at the meeting next Wednesday with the city council, but they'll be reviewing and asking questions, I'm sure.

429
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:23,550
[SPEAKER_06]: But Therese Medford has the lead on this.

430
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they'd like our support, you know, as backup.

431
00:38:29,961 --> 00:38:30,701
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one thing.

432
00:38:31,401 --> 00:38:34,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there an updated version of the ordinances?

433
00:38:35,363 --> 00:38:36,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I had sent that out a few months ago.

434
00:38:37,183 --> 00:38:39,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember an email I sent that out?

435
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:41,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but it was nothing since then.

436
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

437
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:43,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing since then.

438
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:53,708
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, see the last I heard, and I had been going to the meetings except for last month, they were going to try to have a meeting with some of the building department people.

439
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:58,410
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if that happened last month.

440
00:38:59,010 --> 00:38:59,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So

441
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,587
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, it's time they start moving this along.

442
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:10,430
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe they did present the ordinances, the city council, maybe it went to the city solicitor for review.

443
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So it should be an interesting meeting.

444
00:39:12,571 --> 00:39:17,533
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, I don't know, Amanda and Savage enrolled with no more.

445
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:25,456
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I hear anything next Tuesday night or before then I'll email Brenda and she can share it if you don't mind, but the rest of the members.

446
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:29,646
[SPEAKER_06]: But I did leave a message for Amanda that if she could attend tonight, that would be great.

447
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:30,526
[SPEAKER_06]: It was last minute.

448
00:39:31,007 --> 00:39:40,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just heard yesterday about this to give us any updates or if she wanted to speak on this at all.

449
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:47,598
[SPEAKER_06]: But those were the ordinances they submitted a few months ago, May or June to the city council.

450
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:51,681
[SPEAKER_06]: It could have, yeah, I think it was May or June.

451
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:55,435
[SPEAKER_06]: So I haven't seen any updates to that.

452
00:39:55,535 --> 00:39:57,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the finals they submitted.

453
00:39:57,296 --> 00:40:04,241
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's up to the city council to decide how they want to, or if they want to move forward with that and adjustments.

454
00:40:06,723 --> 00:40:09,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So just mark your calendars, everyone that's interested.

455
00:40:10,746 --> 00:40:15,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Next Wednesday, again, it's six o'clock city hall or by Zoom.

456
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:20,393
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the events calendar at medfordmass.org under events and there's a Zoom ID.

457
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:27,961
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have it in my phone, if you'd like it.

458
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:32,104
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't wanna waste people's time, but I'm gonna look it up real quick.

459
00:40:34,206 --> 00:40:35,547
[SPEAKER_06]: City Council Tree Orders.

460
00:40:36,228 --> 00:40:36,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Zoom meeting, 842-963-18382.

461
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:37,689
[SPEAKER_06]: 842-963-18382.

462
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:40,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's on the city website.

463
00:40:50,352 --> 00:40:51,653
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't post the agenda yet.

464
00:40:52,274 --> 00:41:00,040
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you go to the events on calendar and you click on Wednesday, the 20th, you scroll down to city council meeting.

465
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,641
[SPEAKER_06]: It just sets a Zoom ID.

466
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:07,966
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll probably post the agenda maybe next Wednesday or at least the day before the meeting.

467
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:17,113
[SPEAKER_06]: The other interesting thing with Trees Medford is in the energy committee,

468
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:31,068
[SPEAKER_06]: is years ago we started talking about it'd be interesting to have a city program to educate people about important trees in Medford.

469
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:43,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you look to the Energy and Environment Committee report that was done on municipal strategies to educate people about trees and preserving the tree canopy,

470
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:47,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It has educational ideas and programs.

471
00:41:47,937 --> 00:41:55,501
[SPEAKER_06]: You can find that report, the true report that the Energy Committee wrote, on gogreenmetro.org.

472
00:41:56,081 --> 00:42:03,244
[SPEAKER_06]: You click on trees and it will have the introduction letter to the report and also the appendix.

473
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:09,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number four is about having a landmark tree program in the city.

474
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:12,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Trees would be nominated through a process.

475
00:42:13,274 --> 00:42:36,580
[SPEAKER_06]: and maybe would have different groups contribute to this so that if certain trees are nominated because of different reasons, their size, history, background, importance, that could be put on a map and also would have a walking tour map of these significant trees.

476
00:42:38,117 --> 00:42:51,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So Therese Medford has been thinking about this for a while and we actually had a meeting last Thursday I think it was at the library for people who are interested in moving this forward and there's a lot of interest.

477
00:42:52,185 --> 00:42:56,747
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was at the meeting and we are going to Kim D'Andrade

478
00:42:57,892 --> 00:43:11,920
[SPEAKER_06]: from Trees MedFed actually had the group and there was a lot of excitement and we had a one hour meeting scheduled to discuss this possible program and shoot around ideas and it went really quick so there's a lot of interest.

479
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:19,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there were 13 people interested but only six or say seven people came to that meeting.

480
00:43:20,891 --> 00:43:28,779
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just formulating the ideas of how to start this, and the name of the project what we will call it so it could be.

481
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,863
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be a Google or a doodle poll.

482
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,006
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we want to call the name it will probably.

483
00:43:37,012 --> 00:43:50,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll have to see what everyone else says, but it might just end up being significant trees of Medford or something like that, instead of landmark or just historic, because we want to include many types of trees.

484
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:56,301
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't just have to be the oldest tree in Medford and other criteria.

485
00:43:56,321 --> 00:43:57,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And we actually talked about

486
00:44:00,072 --> 00:44:15,455
[SPEAKER_06]: the program and how it would set it up, and maybe having students involved in making the walking tour map, and maybe engineering would help with pinpointing the trees, and there could be city trees too.

487
00:44:15,495 --> 00:44:17,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be just on private property.

488
00:44:19,255 --> 00:44:21,456
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a new development.

489
00:44:21,816 --> 00:44:23,036
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll keep you informed.

490
00:44:23,316 --> 00:44:25,016
[SPEAKER_06]: You can always join in on the meetings.

491
00:44:25,436 --> 00:44:29,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Patrice Medford, the next meeting, like I said, is next Tuesday.

492
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:31,569
[SPEAKER_06]: the 19th at 6 o'clock.

493
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,055
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.

494
00:44:37,555 --> 00:44:51,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Loretta, when you send out the reminder, maybe you could attach the latest versions of the ordinance, the documents, because I probably lost Reno from months ago.

495
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:54,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

496
00:44:54,297 --> 00:44:56,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.

497
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:57,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

498
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:01,011
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it in the agenda online somewhere?

499
00:45:02,394 --> 00:45:03,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to remember.

500
00:45:06,605 --> 00:45:15,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I attended the April Energy Committee meeting, and I had expected to attend Abigail's festivities, and then I took a leave of absence.

501
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it came out in May.

502
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:22,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I sent it to Brenda, and I know she distributed it.

503
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:24,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, I will try to find it.

504
00:45:26,361 --> 00:45:28,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, make sure we got the latest version.

505
00:45:28,743 --> 00:45:29,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

506
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:33,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have it again.

507
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:35,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably lost it by now.

508
00:45:35,825 --> 00:45:36,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

509
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,628
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would have to read it again, too.

510
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:40,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, OK.

511
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:44,195
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what changes they made, you know, based on recommendations.

512
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:47,899
[SPEAKER_06]: So I shouldn't say I don't know.

513
00:45:47,919 --> 00:45:48,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

514
00:45:50,843 --> 00:45:52,024
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, I can do that.

515
00:45:53,065 --> 00:45:53,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

516
00:45:56,178 --> 00:46:02,000
[SPEAKER_02]: 2 quick points 1, I absolutely adore the significant trees project.

517
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,901
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's fantastic.

518
00:46:04,581 --> 00:46:08,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would make a great social media campaign, get people excited.

519
00:46:08,443 --> 00:46:09,923
[SPEAKER_02]: People love attaching.

520
00:46:10,963 --> 00:46:13,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, love and affection towards those kinds of projects.

521
00:46:14,084 --> 00:46:15,625
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of fat bear week.

522
00:46:16,225 --> 00:46:18,226
[SPEAKER_02]: But that the National Park Service does where.

523
00:46:19,484 --> 00:46:24,071
[SPEAKER_02]: People vote on their favorite bears that are fattening themselves in Alaska for winter.

524
00:46:25,012 --> 00:46:32,943
[SPEAKER_02]: People would love to partake in that, and I think that's a great project we should be pushing forward and just getting some attention on.

525
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm glad that's happening.

526
00:46:36,671 --> 00:46:45,435
[SPEAKER_02]: The other quick question I had, and this doesn't necessarily have to be something, Loretta, you can answer, but maybe Brenda and the rest of the committee as well.

527
00:46:46,255 --> 00:46:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we looked over and kind of gave our seal of approval towards these proposals.

528
00:46:53,057 --> 00:47:04,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other ways in which we can kind of use our position on this committee to give credence, to give a favorable showing in the town hall meeting?

529
00:47:07,149 --> 00:47:11,272
[SPEAKER_06]: showing up, showing up.

530
00:47:14,494 --> 00:47:30,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody has a different opinion, but it's important to show support for their work and our work too, and assisting them with previous knowledge that we've had, but they're the ones that are putting this through.

531
00:47:30,345 --> 00:47:33,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we could use, especially talking about

532
00:47:34,453 --> 00:47:38,097
[SPEAKER_06]: all the challenges we have with losing the tree canopy.

533
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:46,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have mentioned before, it would be really important to show the tree canopy coverage from like 15 years ago and what it is now.

534
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:52,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I know a lot of them died or got damaged, but a lot of them have been cut.

535
00:47:53,569 --> 00:48:03,894
[SPEAKER_06]: by development or even if they did die, there's been, look at all the trees cut down at McDonald Park due, I think that was to the Emerald Ash Borer.

536
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:15,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're losing a ton of trees, a lot of old ones that in our lifetime, in the next, we won't have because of their age.

537
00:48:17,422 --> 00:48:20,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And they provide the most environmental benefits.

538
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:25,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it would be really important that they, the city council does something.

539
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:33,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know some of the challenges they will say, but I'm going to defer to trees method and their work and I know that they were

540
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:45,163
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for support or maybe not as much at this meeting, but these are the people who are making decisions for our health and our environment in this city.

541
00:48:46,084 --> 00:48:57,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Other cities are much more progressive about this, like Arlington and Cambridge and Winchester and Concord and all the ones you know that are also cited in the tree report.

542
00:48:59,156 --> 00:49:11,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to show up to see if they missed anything or if they say something, they're not as knowledgeable as this group is about our environment and trees.

543
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,201
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think any of the city council are.

544
00:49:17,182 --> 00:49:20,303
[SPEAKER_06]: All of you have a lot of knowledge and experience in this.

545
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:35,253
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know they'll be asking questions, so it'll be important to back up Tree's method, and they have a lot of experience too, but just in case something's missed, it's important to say.

546
00:49:35,273 --> 00:49:37,354
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my only advice.

547
00:49:38,535 --> 00:49:46,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will mention it to them again about the mapping to show the holes of all the areas.

548
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:47,803
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have some maps.

549
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:54,366
[SPEAKER_06]: of before and now to show the drastic reduction in our trait therapy.

550
00:49:57,432 --> 00:50:00,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I do wanna go back to some things that I forgot to mention that's important.

551
00:50:01,214 --> 00:50:13,941
[SPEAKER_06]: About this program for whatever it's gonna be called, Heritage Trees, Significant Trees, whatever, Dee Morris, who is our local historian was at the meeting to discuss this program and she's excited about it too.

552
00:50:14,401 --> 00:50:21,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's another segue and opportunity because she had given a presentation at the library about historic trees in Medford.

553
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:25,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was a couple of years back and it was fascinating.

554
00:50:26,307 --> 00:50:30,670
[SPEAKER_06]: So she will be part of this program.

555
00:50:32,232 --> 00:50:37,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.

556
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:45,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you send or resend those proposals our way, I would love to know where we can find out more about when those meetings are.

557
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:49,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to keep involved.

558
00:50:49,344 --> 00:50:53,908
[SPEAKER_02]: But otherwise, maybe I'll just keep joining Tree's Medford meetings as well.

559
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:55,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, I'll send you that information.

560
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:00,911
[SPEAKER_06]: They sent the email out already for next Tuesday night at six o'clock.

561
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:02,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're very quick.

562
00:51:02,412 --> 00:51:05,613
[SPEAKER_06]: They're only an hour, the meetings, the six to seven.

563
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:09,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, fantastic.

564
00:51:11,975 --> 00:51:16,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, Brenda, I hope your voice is feeling okay.

565
00:51:16,636 --> 00:51:17,537
[SPEAKER_02]: We need you one more time.

566
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:24,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this for the air quality communications?

567
00:51:24,977 --> 00:51:25,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

568
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:44,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that came up when we had all that smoke from the wildfires is that the city didn't have any prepared materials about outdoor air quality in particular for events like that.

569
00:51:46,205 --> 00:51:53,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think some things were cobbled together and put out, and it wasn't necessarily perfect for the moment.

570
00:51:56,569 --> 00:52:01,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob, you had sent along some information that I think will be helpful moving forward.

571
00:52:01,631 --> 00:52:13,356
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm just wondering, do folks in this group want to participate in developing communications about how to deal with bad outdoor air quality?

572
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:18,773
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be a really good idea.

573
00:52:18,793 --> 00:52:20,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately think also.

574
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:23,774
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have for other events as well.

575
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:26,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like extended drought.

576
00:52:27,356 --> 00:52:32,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Extended rainfall, we almost definitely have things for snowfall, but.

577
00:52:33,878 --> 00:52:38,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Being prepared for if, you know, if more extreme weather is going to be.

578
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,120
[SPEAKER_02]: The norm, we need to be better prepared for that.

579
00:52:42,361 --> 00:52:43,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So we should start.

580
00:52:43,821 --> 00:52:46,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can think of no better group than those in this call.

581
00:52:49,931 --> 00:53:06,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can reach out to our board of health to see what materials they already have for any sort of extreme weather events, if they have any at all.

582
00:53:07,542 --> 00:53:08,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can share with you guys.

583
00:53:10,664 --> 00:53:16,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can talk about what sort of content that should be included in there.

584
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:26,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Brenda, is the city going to be able to get some of those free purple air monitors to augment what we already have?

585
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was an option to do that.

586
00:53:29,237 --> 00:53:31,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget under what program.

587
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I know of.

588
00:53:37,602 --> 00:53:39,983
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're participating in anything right now.

589
00:53:43,241 --> 00:53:55,061
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember sending you something months ago, probably forgot what it was, but it was an option, maybe under the state, that you could get more of these monitors.

590
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,962
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to look it up and resend it to you.

591
00:54:00,582 --> 00:54:02,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if it's still an option.

592
00:54:03,244 --> 00:54:05,605
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have some holes in our coverage.

593
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:12,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one in my backyard, which I think usually agrees well with this TEP monitor in Chelsea.

594
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:18,232
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did have a lot of sharp gradients recently.

595
00:54:19,013 --> 00:54:22,635
[SPEAKER_01]: I monitor, I have a color code in my monitor.

596
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:47,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And it corresponds to the typical, there's some sort of air quality scale that, and if it's 100 means you're at the cusp of going into a bad set of ratings.

597
00:54:52,126 --> 00:54:54,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's green, and that's good.

598
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:56,830
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was red at the time.

599
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:02,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent you an email about, oh, my monitor is glowing red, and you can smell it.

600
00:55:04,297 --> 00:55:11,523
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the map, and there are online maps, there were some clear areas, so it was localized.

601
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:30,305
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are recommendations where you stay indoors, basically, because keep the bad air out, the good air in, and try not to exercise a whole lot in those areas.

602
00:55:30,825 --> 00:55:32,745
[SPEAKER_01]: There's common sense things to do.

603
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:39,487
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really do, if you have an air purifier indoors, maybe you activate that.

604
00:55:41,017 --> 00:55:45,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that are common sense types of things to do.

605
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:54,551
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some schools actually had to close in Salem or whatever, or restrict their extracurricular activities based on this.

606
00:55:56,693 --> 00:55:58,215
[SPEAKER_01]: It is definitely a health concern.

607
00:56:02,705 --> 00:56:09,769
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was very local as far as, like, I remember I was driving back from the airport one of those days, and I had my windows open.

608
00:56:10,209 --> 00:56:12,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I came out of the tunnel, everything was all right.

609
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:17,873
[SPEAKER_08]: But then after I kind of got on the expressway more towards Somerville, all of a sudden I could really smell the smoke.

610
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:20,754
[SPEAKER_08]: And then by the time I got to Medford, I couldn't really smell it anymore.

611
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:22,535
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could see it off in the distance.

612
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:27,938
[SPEAKER_08]: So I knew that somehow the wind was blowing from that plume of smoke across into Cambridge.

613
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:31,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And people that I knew who lived in Cambridge said it was really bad in Cambridge that day.

614
00:56:48,085 --> 00:56:52,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda, was there anything else regarding the air quality communications?

615
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:57,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

616
00:56:57,467 --> 00:57:06,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to know, I have been quite underwater lately in terms of my workload.

617
00:57:06,849 --> 00:57:13,011
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there someone in this group who would be willing to sort of take on leading that project?

618
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,702
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, what project was that?

619
00:57:21,922 --> 00:57:22,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I was distracted.

620
00:57:23,043 --> 00:57:25,084
[SPEAKER_03]: The air quality communications.

621
00:57:25,664 --> 00:57:29,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can help you with that since I'm an air quality scientist.

622
00:57:29,948 --> 00:57:30,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

623
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:36,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I say you what the typical recommendations are in American Lung Association and other groups.

624
00:57:39,192 --> 00:57:48,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if there are web links to the Purple Air monitoring network, which includes state monitors, they add those.

625
00:57:48,138 --> 00:57:56,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having access to a map of these monitors is good.

626
00:57:56,123 --> 00:58:01,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could just post a link that anyone can get on at any time and see it.

627
00:58:06,287 --> 00:58:12,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are those are things and we can also post the these common sense recommendations.

628
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:24,728
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually what you do is you tune into the TV weather, a segment of the news and they talk about these things.

629
00:58:24,788 --> 00:58:28,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of that stuff on the news anyway.

630
00:58:28,652 --> 00:58:32,816
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we, Medford has to have like an alert system for the smoke.

631
00:58:34,438 --> 00:58:36,901
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can provide people with links to,

632
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:50,357
[SPEAKER_01]: real-time maps and links to recommendations from the American Leg Association or other qualified entities, EPA, et cetera, as to what to do under these circumstances.

633
00:58:50,377 --> 00:58:52,498
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the best we can do right now.

634
00:58:53,158 --> 00:59:06,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was thinking the city has the, I guess robocall is what you would call it, but it's not just necessarily calls, it's also texts and other things so that

635
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:11,889
[SPEAKER_03]: In an event like that, they can get the word out to people a little bit faster.

636
00:59:11,909 --> 00:59:19,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So just having something prepared to be able to hand off to the mayor's team to do those calls would be really good.

637
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:27,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, usually it's either a widespread event from like a Canadian fire, which we're all suffering.

638
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:40,731
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're no better off in Medford than in Melrose or whatever, or if it's very localized, I don't know, there's a way to figure out where it is, and it depends on where the wind is blowing.

639
00:59:43,232 --> 00:59:47,713
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's an interesting dilemma.

640
00:59:47,954 --> 00:59:57,417
[SPEAKER_01]: There are real-time websites as to the, you know, there's obviously, oddly enough, the iSurf, surfing people,

641
00:59:58,653 --> 01:00:01,958
[SPEAKER_01]: are very, they have great forecasts of winds.

642
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:12,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I surf whatever website has like up to a 24 hour forecast of the wind patterns.

643
01:00:13,472 --> 01:00:15,675
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can get those if you want, you know.

644
01:00:17,902 --> 01:00:27,627
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know how far we have to go toward getting weather outlooks, because that really goes toward, that's the National Weather Service, I guess, more or less.

645
01:00:28,507 --> 01:00:30,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

646
01:00:30,948 --> 01:00:35,570
[SPEAKER_08]: The purple air monitors, wouldn't they help you to map what was going on?

647
01:00:38,251 --> 01:00:40,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Instantaneous basis, not a forecast, though.

648
01:00:40,553 --> 01:00:44,054
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the purple air monitors are good, and I like that.

649
01:00:44,134 --> 01:00:45,255
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one in my backyard.

650
01:00:46,214 --> 01:00:51,715
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll try to send you that opportunity to get more free ones.

651
01:00:51,955 --> 01:00:57,057
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're about 300 bucks or something like that to get one of these.

652
01:00:57,597 --> 01:00:59,157
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get some for free.

653
01:00:59,777 --> 01:01:03,038
[SPEAKER_00]: You get wind forecast from the National Weather Service.

654
01:01:03,298 --> 01:01:05,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Marine forecast for fishermen and boaters.

655
01:01:05,799 --> 01:01:08,279
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be pretty good.

656
01:01:08,919 --> 01:01:09,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

657
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:15,728
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of, yeah, we'll have to keep talking, Brenda.

658
01:01:16,408 --> 01:01:18,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming, of course, all those entities exist six months from now.

659
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:19,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

660
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:22,012
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

661
01:01:22,132 --> 01:01:34,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I think having tips that are as simple as possible will be really helpful in addition to that purple air map that's very visual and very striking.

662
01:01:36,883 --> 01:01:39,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the tips are really what I was thinking of, yeah.

663
01:01:40,235 --> 01:01:43,556
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe recommendations by AQI.

664
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:48,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like, oh, if it's between zero and 75, like just do what you're going to do.

665
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:52,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's over a hundred, like you should limit your time to 20 minutes or who knows.

666
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:57,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

667
01:01:57,379 --> 01:01:58,979
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not, thank you.

668
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:03,841
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like you started out in Lahore, Pakistan and they had like over a thousand AQI or something.

669
01:02:04,101 --> 01:02:05,121
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an awful thing.

670
01:02:08,662 --> 01:02:08,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

671
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:09,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Over a thousand.

672
01:02:19,976 --> 01:02:20,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

673
01:02:21,176 --> 01:02:26,258
[SPEAKER_02]: With that unreal fact, let's send it back to you, Bob.

674
01:02:26,678 --> 01:02:31,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about waste reduction to kind of round us out for the evening.

675
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

676
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:40,383
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the last person that knows much about waste reduction, but since I talked about it in a couple of meetings ago, I was put on the agenda.

677
01:02:41,803 --> 01:02:46,265
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I looked up the fact that Melrose has a zero waste committee.

678
01:02:47,045 --> 01:02:53,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are doing some good things, and it might be useful to have a, if we could ask a representative to talk about their program.

679
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:56,830
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent a link to the committee about them.

680
01:02:56,990 --> 01:03:03,253
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, for example, I don't know, does Medford have a polystyrene ordinance?

681
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:11,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they have one that limits, because that's a source of a lot of waste.

682
01:03:11,858 --> 01:03:15,600
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to look at to see if, does Medford have that?

683
01:03:16,608 --> 01:03:20,469
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have a TerraCycle.

684
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:33,053
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sort of a unique collection program that takes sort of oddball things, but they have regular collections.

685
01:03:33,093 --> 01:03:42,456
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some organizations that will actually take things that are hard to recycle otherwise, and you can bring them to collection sites.

686
01:03:42,516 --> 01:03:44,557
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we should team up with those people.

687
01:03:45,873 --> 01:03:58,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, Brenda, the fact that they also have the holiday swap, where if anyone wants to get rid of their Christmas tablecloths or things, they do that in Melrose too.

688
01:03:59,779 --> 01:04:05,622
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be something to do when we do our Jingle Bells Festival.

689
01:04:07,382 --> 01:04:12,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, people bring things in and anyone can come in and just take it for free.

690
01:04:13,025 --> 01:04:15,206
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a plant swap, a holiday swap.

691
01:04:17,445 --> 01:04:24,569
[SPEAKER_01]: That would maybe get more foot traffic in the Jingle Bells Festival or whatever they want.

692
01:04:24,829 --> 01:04:36,736
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure it's the same category, but the plastic takeout containers that are black and therefore not recyclable, if a campaign to convince

693
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:45,463
[SPEAKER_00]: takeout places to not use the black containers anymore, and to use clear ones or compostable ones even better.

694
01:04:45,723 --> 01:04:47,364
[SPEAKER_00]: But the black ones are not recyclable.

695
01:04:47,764 --> 01:04:49,845
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine this is like a black lobby.

696
01:04:50,105 --> 01:04:57,329
[SPEAKER_00]: There must be some way of convincing both the manufacturers and the proprietors to use ones that are recyclable.

697
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:00,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts about that?

698
01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:03,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's sort of funny.

699
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I use all those for leftovers.

700
01:05:05,696 --> 01:05:06,937
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep reusing myself.

701
01:05:08,378 --> 01:05:10,540
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were, if they were clean, you could still reuse.

702
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:28,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that might be, we might get a lot of input to, for our experts and maybe that one candidate, um, to our committee and also representatives of other cities that do have these like Melrose.

703
01:05:28,473 --> 01:05:31,355
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would, I would recommend that we contact,

704
01:05:32,216 --> 01:05:41,199
[SPEAKER_01]: the Zero Waste Melrose people and see if they could give us a presentation of how they're doing and what they would recommend that we do.

705
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:42,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a great idea.

706
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:45,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime next winter season, next year.

707
01:05:49,981 --> 01:05:52,462
[SPEAKER_02]: On the topic of, please.

708
01:05:53,377 --> 01:06:03,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say, I mean, I think it's similar, like, the MFN does their toy swap in their children's clothing swap and those are other things that are diverted from.

709
01:06:04,404 --> 01:06:09,747
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, waste streams and that's a huge area that.

710
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:14,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Swaps are done and then I know there's been a bunch of the.

711
01:06:18,338 --> 01:06:18,898
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they?

712
01:06:20,259 --> 01:06:30,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Drew, everything is free Medford, which I don't know if Melrose has an equivalent one, but I know that there's definitely a lot of things saved from.

713
01:06:30,785 --> 01:06:34,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we could just kind of build off of that as well.

714
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:39,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know that we have a very robust free.

715
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:54,913
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, things as everything down to, you know, half a half eaten birthday cake is saved from the waste, which I've always been super impressed with.

716
01:06:55,093 --> 01:07:07,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that, you know, not all communities have as robust a kind of free site, but maybe it's a matter of having more of these swap events that are like more targeted.

717
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:11,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that could be cool because the LFN swap days are

718
01:07:13,377 --> 01:07:14,619
[SPEAKER_04]: loved in the community.

719
01:07:15,902 --> 01:07:22,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be able to swap other things as well, other than just kids clothing is I think could be really good.

720
01:07:26,257 --> 01:07:27,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good ideas.

721
01:07:27,879 --> 01:07:34,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can keep going on this next year as more development here.

722
01:07:34,947 --> 01:07:39,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Zero Waste and Melrose actually have monthly meetings like we do.

723
01:07:39,912 --> 01:07:42,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we need a separate entity for that.

724
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:46,259
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be just an outgrowth of this committee.

725
01:07:48,165 --> 01:08:02,219
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's good to hear from them, and I'd have to look to see if other cities and towns have similar committees, but Melrose is pretty close to us, and I think they've been going for a couple of years.

726
01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:04,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably good to hear from them.

727
01:08:09,399 --> 01:08:17,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to add, I saw something interesting, and it's a little bit like, you know what you're talking about.

728
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:21,244
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to share that with the group was posted on mass.

729
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:24,806
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the day after Thanksgiving is black Friday where.

730
01:08:25,623 --> 01:08:28,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Billions of people buy things, you know, at deals.

731
01:08:28,726 --> 01:08:34,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So this gentleman on Facebook that posted, he had this event last year.

732
01:08:34,512 --> 01:08:37,335
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Buy Nothing Day, and it's a swap.

733
01:08:38,056 --> 01:08:42,080
[SPEAKER_06]: And he had a lot of response, and he holds it at Arlington Church.

734
01:08:43,777 --> 01:08:46,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's called Buy Nothing Day and it's open to the public.

735
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:51,725
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a short period of time and you bring things you don't want in good condition or new items.

736
01:08:52,706 --> 01:08:59,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can go in and also take what you can carry out that people leave.

737
01:09:00,133 --> 01:09:06,399
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a great way to reduce unwanted things and recycle.

738
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:12,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think they serve food and there's music.

739
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:14,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite a large event actually.

740
01:09:17,267 --> 01:09:19,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just add that everything is free Medford.

741
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:28,575
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the people in my office, Teresa Dupont, helps to organize like the junk in the trunk swap event that happens.

742
01:09:28,975 --> 01:09:29,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

743
01:09:30,036 --> 01:09:30,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

744
01:09:37,153 --> 01:09:42,514
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if something could be initiated with respect to the farmer's market.

745
01:09:42,534 --> 01:09:47,216
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's room for that or that would be overwhelming.

746
01:09:47,836 --> 01:09:58,518
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's another venue that might be good for such swaps occasionally, maybe once a month or something.

747
01:10:00,759 --> 01:10:01,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an idea.

748
01:10:06,297 --> 01:10:08,018
[SPEAKER_06]: But we can also host one too.

749
01:10:09,138 --> 01:10:18,263
[SPEAKER_06]: We could pick a place like the library, that conference room area is always open for rental at no cost at the library, the function room.

750
01:10:21,024 --> 01:10:23,145
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of options to do something like that.

751
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:29,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a great thing that, you know, we should be probably just hosting.

752
01:10:29,548 --> 01:10:29,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

753
01:10:30,428 --> 01:10:31,649
[SPEAKER_06]: We could host that, right?

754
01:10:31,989 --> 01:10:32,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

755
01:10:35,668 --> 01:10:42,150
[SPEAKER_02]: two other little waste reduction-y things, because this lines up actually with my day-to-day line of work.

756
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:52,673
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was, over the summer, when I was not joining you all for meetings, I was canvassing in Seattle for some time.

757
01:10:53,593 --> 01:10:58,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a program out there, as well as a couple other cities I've learned, called RIDWELL.

758
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:01,683
[SPEAKER_02]: R-I-D-W-E-L-L.

759
01:11:02,543 --> 01:11:08,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a... And I'm not going to sponsor them or anything.

760
01:11:08,468 --> 01:11:11,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any connections to them or anything.

761
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,731
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we could find similar services...

762
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:36,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, they are a big box that you put on your front step, and they help you to organize what you're recycling, and they take a wider range of different recyclables, anything from multilayered plastics to textiles to different light bulbs and batteries, and also those plastic

763
01:11:37,781 --> 01:11:43,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Clamshell containers, you sort them, put them in your bin and they will collect them every couple of weeks.

764
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:49,077
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it gives people an alternative option for recycling.

765
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:52,682
[SPEAKER_02]: To recycle things that they don't normally get to recycle.

766
01:11:56,701 --> 01:12:01,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's something that I wanted to at least throw out into the ether.

767
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:11,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Let people think on and see if it's something that we believe would be right for Medford, or maybe just a greater Boston area push we could start making.

768
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:15,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I look down here, they have.

769
01:12:17,345 --> 01:12:23,027
[SPEAKER_02]: They service Atlanta, Austin, the Bay Area, Denver, Portland, Seattle.

770
01:12:24,268 --> 01:12:28,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of major cities that we should be bringing to the East Coast, perhaps.

771
01:12:31,831 --> 01:12:37,213
[SPEAKER_01]: M-A-P-C, you would think, metropolitan area or whatever that stands for.

772
01:12:38,114 --> 01:12:45,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it might be too big for just us, but I'm sure we have a consortium of folks that would be interested.

773
01:12:48,528 --> 01:12:53,337
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I wanted to speak on while we have a minute devoted to it.

774
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,181
[SPEAKER_02]: My day-to-day job is an advocate for right to repair.

775
01:12:58,901 --> 01:13:02,202
[SPEAKER_02]: We focus a lot on making sure you can fix your electronics.

776
01:13:04,363 --> 01:13:17,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So I spend a lot of time at repair cafes and public fix-it events, opportunities for people to take all the appliances and electronics and phones and tablets that they think are broken and actually work with people to fix them.

777
01:13:18,648 --> 01:13:22,490
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a really large community across the country, across the world.

778
01:13:24,512 --> 01:13:37,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in addition to these swap events, we should have repair events because e-waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the world.

779
01:13:38,477 --> 01:13:43,379
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not terribly recyclable and is very toxic.

780
01:13:43,779 --> 01:13:51,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important that we support repair and make sure people can actually fix the stuff that they like and keep it in use for longer.

781
01:14:00,143 --> 01:14:05,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I missed a couple of meetings here since April, well since May.

782
01:14:06,412 --> 01:14:09,256
[SPEAKER_06]: And several years ago, I just want to bring this up.

783
01:14:10,582 --> 01:14:16,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really concerned about the single-use batteries and how they weren't recyclable, and now they are recyclable.

784
01:14:16,405 --> 01:14:24,370
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't know if the rest of the members knew this, but Staples has really grown in what they accept free for recyclables.

785
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:33,415
[SPEAKER_06]: So single-use batteries like 9V, Cs, Ds, As, and alkaline batteries, they accept those free for recycling now at Staples locations.

786
01:14:34,215 --> 01:14:35,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I was so happy to see that.

787
01:14:36,176 --> 01:14:43,099
[SPEAKER_06]: And I went to City Hall and talked with the DPW office at the main office.

788
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:54,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they also accept certain rechargeable batteries and certain kinds of lights and cell phones for recycling in their office.

789
01:14:55,263 --> 01:14:57,964
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted them to be aware of the Staples program.

790
01:14:58,004 --> 01:14:59,025
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're aware of that, too.

791
01:15:00,414 --> 01:15:05,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the Havasura Energy Festival, I'm sure they also took single-use batteries for recycling.

792
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:10,142
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is all year round, you know, you can go into Staples.

793
01:15:10,302 --> 01:15:19,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you actually set up a free account with them, they'll give you points for recycling that you can use to purchase their products.

794
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:25,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to mention that in case people weren't aware.

795
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:29,971
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's fantastic.

796
01:15:30,591 --> 01:15:35,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the big takeaway for me was at the harvester energy festival.

797
01:15:35,115 --> 01:15:37,196
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the recycling and shredding.

798
01:15:37,636 --> 01:15:41,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Companies come in and they are the largest, most popular parts.

799
01:15:42,039 --> 01:15:47,603
[SPEAKER_02]: In a lot of respects, so we need to be facilitating that more.

800
01:15:48,604 --> 01:15:51,026
[SPEAKER_02]: More hands down, whether that's.

801
01:15:51,766 --> 01:15:54,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Other options for recycling other options for repair.

802
01:15:56,575 --> 01:16:03,217
[SPEAKER_02]: and avenues for people to dispose of things appropriately, I think is an important avenue to pursue.

803
01:16:03,237 --> 01:16:05,077
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

804
01:16:06,518 --> 01:16:07,958
[SPEAKER_06]: We could even do that at events.

805
01:16:08,478 --> 01:16:14,580
[SPEAKER_06]: If we decided to have an event, we could have people bring in their single-use batteries and stock them up at home and bring them in.

806
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we could bring them in staples for them.

807
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,201
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of things we could do.

808
01:16:22,336 --> 01:16:30,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to point out the library does occasionally have fix it clinics, so that might be a good way that we can partner with them.

809
01:16:32,945 --> 01:16:33,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love that.

810
01:16:34,086 --> 01:16:38,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's something you partner with high schools and maker spaces and.

811
01:16:39,691 --> 01:16:44,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's into that, so lots of avenues all up in the air at once and I think we'll.

812
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:52,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe distill it, I'll distill some of this into a thing we can talk about next week or next month.

813
01:16:55,658 --> 01:16:59,719
[SPEAKER_02]: As a space where we can begin something pretty actionable.

814
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like this is an easy one and kind of low hanging fruit.

815
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:13,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Before you were in the meeting, well, I wanted to mention something under new stuff if I have a minute.

816
01:17:14,236 --> 01:17:14,717
[SPEAKER_06]: So just.

817
01:17:14,917 --> 01:17:16,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we definitely do.

818
01:17:16,618 --> 01:17:16,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

819
01:17:16,878 --> 01:17:17,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

820
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:19,280
[SPEAKER_06]: But well, I don't know what was done.

821
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,060
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to.

822
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:20,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

823
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:21,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm done.

824
01:17:23,382 --> 01:17:26,104
[SPEAKER_01]: People have got good ideas, good input into this.

825
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:33,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the nice thing about this is that it can be it could save people money and not cost the city anything.

826
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:33,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

827
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:40,174
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for our well-being as a community.

828
01:17:46,198 --> 01:17:47,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like that.

829
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,442
[SPEAKER_06]: We just need more members to help.

830
01:17:50,462 --> 01:17:57,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we always have great ideas, but it's getting them done with more members that are available.

831
01:17:59,481 --> 01:18:10,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things I wanted to bring up, and I brought this up years ago, was the rat poison, escars, or rat poison that kills the predators of rodents.

832
01:18:11,149 --> 01:18:17,873
[SPEAKER_06]: And on Facebook, there's a group that I've been involved with called Newhouse Wildlife Rescue.

833
01:18:18,534 --> 01:18:20,936
[SPEAKER_06]: They're rehabbers for wildlife.

834
01:18:21,476 --> 01:18:28,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And they take in a lot of animals that have been poisoned by commercially bought

835
01:18:29,942 --> 01:18:36,767
[SPEAKER_06]: and also the black boxes we see out there by rat poison.

836
01:18:38,945 --> 01:18:45,390
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a petition, if you go on Facebook, under Newhouse Wildlife Rescue, they're in Massachusetts.

837
01:18:45,911 --> 01:18:57,100
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a petition they started because they have a lot of members and they were able to save a domesticated beaver that they had in their care that couldn't be reintroduced to wildlife.

838
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And the governor actually got involved and they were able to save this

839
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:22,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have a lot of followers, and because they got so much support from all over the world to save this beaver and allow them to keep it as an educational pet, they decided to move forward with, and they have been meeting with the Pest Control Board of Massachusetts to teach them how many animals are actually harmed and killed by rat poison.

840
01:19:24,132 --> 01:19:29,995
[SPEAKER_06]: feed off of mice and rats, like hawks and eagles and foxes and opossums and whatever.

841
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,816
[SPEAKER_06]: So they started a petition this week.

842
01:19:32,876 --> 01:19:41,780
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on their Facebook page for people to sign in support of banning rodenticides in Massachusetts.

843
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought I'd bring that up because it is an important thing.

844
01:19:46,122 --> 01:19:47,082
[SPEAKER_06]: It's environmental.

845
01:19:47,902 --> 01:19:53,045
[SPEAKER_06]: It kills dogs and cats and harms children and

846
01:19:54,154 --> 01:20:00,281
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I just wanted to bring that up if people could go on there and look for the petition on their Facebook page link.

847
01:20:02,764 --> 01:20:07,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathleen just put the link in the chat actually, which is very helpful.

848
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:13,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's the Facebook 1, but I think it's their main site, which is even better.

849
01:20:13,116 --> 01:20:14,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're in.

850
01:20:16,408 --> 01:20:19,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Chelmsford, I think, is where their location is.

851
01:20:19,391 --> 01:20:30,899
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also Cape Ann Wildlife, which is in Gloucester, and they actually help rescue the birds that are hurt or damaged and brought to them by, you know, many different ways.

852
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:36,703
[SPEAKER_06]: But they've had a lot of birds that have died because of rodenticide poisoning.

853
01:20:36,723 --> 01:20:44,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's other ways to manage pests by not using these poisons.

854
01:20:46,381 --> 01:20:47,222
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to bring that up.

855
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for listening.

856
01:20:49,563 --> 01:20:50,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

857
01:20:50,423 --> 01:20:53,365
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a question.

858
01:20:53,385 --> 01:21:02,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember what that drug or chemical or treatment was that keeps them from having babies?

859
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:04,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

860
01:21:04,431 --> 01:21:07,033
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I was going to say, yeah.

861
01:21:07,093 --> 01:21:12,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually bought some because it's the first time ever we started seeing rats in our area.

862
01:21:14,797 --> 01:21:15,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on one second.

863
01:21:17,423 --> 01:21:21,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask my husband.

864
01:21:28,733 --> 01:21:30,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's called Cynetic.

865
01:21:30,314 --> 01:21:30,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Cynetic.

866
01:21:31,415 --> 01:21:34,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Cynetic, that's the name of the company.

867
01:21:34,377 --> 01:21:35,839
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the name of the company.

868
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the name of the product?

869
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:47,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot the name of it, but a couple of years ago, I tried to follow up with the other city that was using it as a test.

870
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:51,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It is expensive, but our city has a great program.

871
01:21:52,421 --> 01:21:57,003
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked with them to have those public meetings and advertise it a couple of years ago.

872
01:21:57,543 --> 01:22:05,768
[SPEAKER_06]: The link is on the city website under the health department for rodent control, and it's a video recording

873
01:22:07,027 --> 01:22:09,988
[SPEAKER_06]: of when Yankee Pest Control came to the city to talk about.

874
01:22:10,128 --> 01:22:10,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right.

875
01:22:11,749 --> 01:22:14,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fantastic and it teaches every, it's so good.

876
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I learned so much.

877
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:18,211
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people did attend, they did it again.

878
01:22:18,231 --> 01:22:19,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So that link's on the website.

879
01:22:20,891 --> 01:22:31,475
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as Yankee Pest Control, if you call the health department and you say you have a problem, they will have someone come out to your property and

880
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:38,924
[SPEAKER_06]: assess it for burrows, for rat burrows, and use, what's it called?

881
01:22:38,964 --> 01:22:39,344
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2?

882
01:22:39,404 --> 01:22:41,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry ice.

883
01:22:41,066 --> 01:22:42,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Dry ice, yeah.

884
01:22:42,827 --> 01:22:43,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry ice.

885
01:22:44,268 --> 01:22:52,814
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to find the two holes and they'll actually use the, I guess you'd call it a gas, to exterminate them.

886
01:22:53,975 --> 01:22:57,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it doesn't hurt other animals or whatever.

887
01:22:57,717 --> 01:22:59,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of people don't know that.

888
01:22:59,959 --> 01:23:12,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, the product is called Synantec Evolved Cotton Saline Oil-Based Soft Bait Contraceptive, formulated to lessen the population in or near your home.

889
01:23:13,446 --> 01:23:14,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It's expensive.

890
01:23:14,971 --> 01:23:19,996
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually bought a bag to try it.

891
01:23:20,836 --> 01:23:26,161
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is they eat it, they're attracted to it, but you have to do a test area.

892
01:23:26,461 --> 01:23:33,206
[SPEAKER_06]: I mentioned it to the health department before, but I didn't get a chance to get back to them, so I need the efficacy report from

893
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:40,504
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who, I can't remember what town, I think it was Lexington, and I made calls to them to see how it worked.

894
01:23:40,525 --> 01:23:50,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to do it like a small area, like maybe just like High Street, for example, a West Memphis shopping area, and you have to keep using it for like six months.

895
01:23:51,219 --> 01:23:53,940
[SPEAKER_06]: and they will stop having babies.

896
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:56,460
[SPEAKER_06]: But is that the answer?

897
01:23:56,541 --> 01:23:57,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's a lot of things.

898
01:23:57,581 --> 01:24:12,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Saling your house is number one, and not having nesting areas for them, and having food on the ground, whether it's your garden, plants that have fallen, fruits and vegetables.

899
01:24:14,764 --> 01:24:17,927
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a problem across the East Coast and people don't realize that.

900
01:24:17,967 --> 01:24:20,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big education curve for people.

901
01:24:20,529 --> 01:24:26,473
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first thing is to blame others, but they use rodenticides.

902
01:24:27,114 --> 01:24:28,595
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not gonna solve the problem.

903
01:24:28,815 --> 01:24:30,937
[SPEAKER_06]: They multiply too much, too quickly.

904
01:24:34,059 --> 01:24:35,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Did that help Kathleen?

905
01:24:36,861 --> 01:24:37,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

906
01:24:37,802 --> 01:24:39,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I might've found it.

907
01:24:39,643 --> 01:24:40,244
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a link.

908
01:24:41,092 --> 01:24:43,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think it was like $36 for a bag.

909
01:24:43,553 --> 01:24:44,193
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know what?

910
01:24:44,553 --> 01:24:45,913
[SPEAKER_06]: They come and they eat and they leave.

911
01:24:46,593 --> 01:24:49,254
[SPEAKER_06]: And it doesn't harm other animals.

912
01:24:51,515 --> 01:24:52,815
[SPEAKER_06]: It's birth control.

913
01:24:54,495 --> 01:24:57,196
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you really want them coming for that?

914
01:24:57,256 --> 01:24:59,116
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to get them away from your property.

915
01:25:01,808 --> 01:25:08,212
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's, so anyways, we did it for a few months and we have less now.

916
01:25:08,652 --> 01:25:13,895
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's also because they passed a no feeding ordinance and people are looking for that.

917
01:25:13,915 --> 01:25:22,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I wasn't clear, like bird seed and stuff like that.

918
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, I'm sorry.

919
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:32,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say, I have cameras around my house specifically for mice and rats because my wife is terrified of them.

920
01:25:33,444 --> 01:25:35,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, mice, yeah, we have mice.

921
01:25:35,785 --> 01:25:39,267
[SPEAKER_08]: But I found that if I have mice, I don't have rats.

922
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:44,509
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do, I saw a rat like, I don't know, a couple of months ago go through my front yard.

923
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:46,270
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't stop at my house.

924
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:49,011
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't tell where it left to and where it came from.

925
01:25:49,031 --> 01:25:52,653
[SPEAKER_08]: But it came onto my property, crossed my property.

926
01:25:53,893 --> 01:25:55,794
[SPEAKER_08]: And it only did it one night.

927
01:25:56,275 --> 01:25:57,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't do it over and over again.

928
01:25:57,776 --> 01:26:03,299
[SPEAKER_08]: But, yeah, rats are really smart.

929
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,201
[SPEAKER_08]: They're kind of industrious.

930
01:26:05,561 --> 01:26:07,402
[SPEAKER_08]: They're really hard to get rid of if you get them.

931
01:26:07,782 --> 01:26:19,310
[SPEAKER_08]: My neighbor had one in their house and it was, you know, it's easy to get one in your house to kill it, but it's hard to find out how did it get in and how do you stop the others from getting it.

932
01:26:21,506 --> 01:26:23,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you can share that video.

933
01:26:23,987 --> 01:26:30,049
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the medfordmass.org website and the health department for them to watch.

934
01:26:30,229 --> 01:26:32,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And he explains it all, how they get in.

935
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:33,930
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about the Yankee Pest Guide.

936
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:35,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

937
01:26:36,031 --> 01:26:36,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to both of those.

938
01:26:36,832 --> 01:26:37,892
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be great to have another one.

939
01:26:38,519 --> 01:26:39,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you were there.

940
01:26:39,559 --> 01:26:39,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

941
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:40,560
[SPEAKER_06]: I was there.

942
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:43,501
[SPEAKER_06]: He did a great job.

943
01:26:43,521 --> 01:26:44,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

944
01:26:44,861 --> 01:26:50,363
[SPEAKER_06]: And the sad thing is, you know, I learned so much because, I mean, who wants to learn about rats?

945
01:26:50,383 --> 01:26:56,685
[SPEAKER_06]: But I learned so much that the rats will follow the mice because the mice pee and they leave the urine smell.

946
01:26:56,946 --> 01:26:58,386
[SPEAKER_06]: They go, oh, where are they going?

947
01:26:58,666 --> 01:26:59,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And they follow that.

948
01:26:59,747 --> 01:27:03,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have them in your house, you really got to be careful, you know.

949
01:27:04,008 --> 01:27:09,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just seen in our neighborhood off of Spring Street, which I've never ever.

950
01:27:09,572 --> 01:27:11,413
[SPEAKER_06]: But then again, we had a lot of cats.

951
01:27:12,314 --> 01:27:19,039
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe because we had cat, now we don't have the cats in the neighborhood, so it could be that.

952
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:28,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I had an item to bring up if we're done with the mice.

953
01:27:29,442 --> 01:27:36,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and I guess I, the only thing I know, and I don't know more, maybe others.

954
01:27:36,748 --> 01:27:40,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Can comment, I guess the Massachusetts house is.

955
01:27:41,711 --> 01:27:44,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Voting on the climate bill tomorrow.

956
01:27:44,233 --> 01:27:45,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw something go out on that.

957
01:27:46,595 --> 01:28:01,739
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the, I don't know what the stream of, does it go to the Senate from here or does anyone know specifically what some of the bigger items are on that?

958
01:28:02,779 --> 01:28:05,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was on a call today, excuse me.

959
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:18,483
[SPEAKER_03]: with Melissa Hoffer and Rebecca Tepper and Gina McCarthy, and they were just talking about the state's reaction to the change in the federal administration.

960
01:28:18,503 --> 01:28:24,485
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that call, they talked about the vote tomorrow on the economic development bond bill.

961
01:28:27,156 --> 01:28:44,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has $400 million for mass CEC, for climate tech, like innovation and offshore wind, and then $300 million of tax credits for climate related businesses.

962
01:28:48,194 --> 01:28:51,137
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the climate bill, I have not seen a good,

963
01:28:52,757 --> 01:28:57,921
[SPEAKER_03]: um, listing of what is in it now after all of the back and forth.

964
01:28:59,362 --> 01:29:12,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I know a major part of it is the, um, siting of energy projects like substations and offshore wind and things like that.

965
01:29:13,292 --> 01:29:20,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and sort of, I don't want to say streamlining, but, um, uh,

966
01:29:22,297 --> 01:29:31,300
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of standardizing the process for that and having more input earlier on in the process from the community.

967
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:38,242
[SPEAKER_03]: But I haven't seen like a final version of the climate bill.

968
01:29:42,664 --> 01:29:43,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

969
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:57,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, any other new business we'd like to discuss?

970
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything we'd like to introduce?

971
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:09,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, is there anything anyone would like to add?

972
01:30:13,725 --> 01:30:14,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Any movements?

973
01:30:18,767 --> 01:30:19,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second that.

974
01:30:26,005 --> 01:30:26,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Any opposed?

975
01:30:29,408 --> 01:30:29,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

976
01:30:30,269 --> 01:30:31,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a wonderful evening.

977
01:30:31,550 --> 01:30:32,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for joining.

978
01:30:33,211 --> 01:30:35,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I will see you in less than like two weeks.

979
01:30:37,114 --> 01:30:44,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems a little too fast, but I know I'll be doing a little write up here too on some zero waste stuff we can do.

980
01:30:45,581 --> 01:30:47,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob can look into some air quality things.

981
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:54,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anyone else is feeling moved by the moment, come prepared, bring a friend.

982
01:30:54,781 --> 01:30:56,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's have people sit in so we can get some new members.

983
01:30:57,751 --> 01:30:58,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

984
01:30:58,393 --> 01:30:58,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Be well.

985
01:30:58,835 --> 01:31:00,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you all soon.
