    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=309.28s">Yeah,</a>  I just briefly appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=312.492s">five</a>  minutes of your time to just talk a little bit about this process before we get into the details. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=319.796s">I</a>  think it's important for people who were not part of the subcommittee group to understand that my feeling is that the process was flawed, direction we were in was flawed, and I did not feel in any way, shape, or form collaboration, and that is why I stopped editing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=341.402s">The</a>  process went very smoothly when we're talking about generic process descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=346.305s">I</a>  thought things were moving in a great direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=348.286s">I</a>  started with, I volunteered to do Jean Barry Sutherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=353.39s">I</a>  started with 14 slides, went down to 10, went down to five, ended up with four. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=358.092s">I</a>  accepted, believe me, this has nothing to do with content, all about process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=365.257s">Emails</a>  were not returned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=366.678s">There</a>  was no collaboration from the committee as far as I was concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=371.195s">So</a>  when I woke up on Sunday and saw that not only did we not discuss my presentation, my presentation was edited, deleted, and words were replaced without any conversation with me at all, which I find highly unprofessional. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=391.2s">So</a>  on May 31st of 518, I wrote to the team and I'll read it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=396.704s">Team,</a>  I'm not sure who decided that my entry on the presentation should be changed and did so without any communication with me, but I am very disappointed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=407.172s">We</a>  are a team and yet all my emails on process were ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=412.216s">Jim</a>  Lister, the chairman is still not included on this email chain. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=416.89s">I</a>  will formally bring this up at tomorrow's meeting, meaning tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=421.013s">When</a>  this committee failed to move forward, I suggested that we at least begin a base attempt to at least begin a discussion at tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=431.822s">I</a>  do not remember assigning a person to change my words and format at will. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=438.027s">In</a>  my opinion, this is the height of arrogance and completely disrespectful to the work of a fellow member. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=444.845s">Should</a>  I go in now and completely change the other two presentations without your knowledge or consent? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=450.387s">I</a>  would never, because I have respect for everyone's effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=456.708s">I</a>  had hoped that we could demonstrate that we are a team, but this action is the last straw. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=463.41s">Now,</a>  we all have to stay up tonight to watch our proposals to see if anyone will change them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=470.245s">Common</a>  courtesy and professionalism dictates that you should show respect for others' efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=475.769s">Respect</a>  is all I ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=480.613s">It</a>  was just incredible to me that this was going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=486.657s">I</a>  mean, I'm shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=488.939s">And</a>  somebody mentioned that maybe that was the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=491.481s">Well,</a>  it wasn't the process I understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=494.74s">And</a>  I want everybody to understand, and we'll go through line by line, because I told the people this morning who were slashing my presentation even more, that I would not edit any more until we get to tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=507.264s">And</a>  you'll see some of the things that need to be changed and what the effort is, in my opinion, to get that change. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=513.686s">I'm</a>  all for change, but not this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=516.662s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=517.843s">It's</a>  not really a discussable issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=519.704s">Let's</a>  move on to the vote.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=521.306s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=522.006s">I'm</a>  so sorry to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=523.407s">I</a>  don't have an email like that from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=525.229s">I</a>  don't know who that was.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=526.25s">Nor</a>  do I. Nor do I. I just searched.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=529.873s">I</a>  just am checking my email as you're speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=532.194s">I</a>  don't have that email from you.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=534.796s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=535.317s">I</a>  mean, it's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=536.458s">I</a>  mean, I have it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=537.959s">It's</a>  in my sent folder, but irregardless of my letter, I could write it today with the same feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=546.245s">The</a>  fact remains, my words, my style, my format was changed without a word to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=555.271s">The</a>  email still works. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=557.352s">A</a>  committee is a collaboration by definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=564.457s">And</a>  it just saddens me that, very disappointed that that process had to exist.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=573.782s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=574.163s">Thank</a>  you, Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=576.96s">Anybody</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=579.121s">Now's</a>  the time.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=579.841s">Ken</a>  has his hand up.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=583.042s">There</a>  are several hands up.</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=590.925s">I</a>  was also under the impression that this was to be a collaborative effort through email. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=598.968s">People</a>  were collaborating through email, and then all communication stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=603.77s">People</a>  would ask people's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=606.14s">and</a>  then there would be no response. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=608.782s">Ron,</a>  I'm sorry, I don't have your email. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=613.305s">It</a>  did not come through to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=615.486s">Who</a>  did you send it to?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=616.487s">Sent</a>  it to the presentation committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=622.791s">And</a>  again, if I read it now or read it three days ago, the action still happened.</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=630.529s">We</a>  could have addressed this three days ago if people on the committee got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=634.391s">There</a>  are several people on the committee who are saying they never received this email.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=639.092s">I</a>  understand what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=640.513s">The</a>  action still happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=642.894s">The</a>  email is the words of my email, whether I say it now or had sent it is not relevant.</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=649.127s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=650.248s">It</a>  is very relevant because there are people who would have said, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=657.111s">That</a>  shouldn't be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=658.511s">We</a>  need to discuss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=659.852s">It</a>  needs to be a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=661.573s">If</a>  you'll notice, when you sent your presentation, I said in email, I think this needs to be shorter. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=669.836s">We</a>  need to standardize the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=673.998s">And</a>  there were some fluff things in there that we could <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=678.348s">put</a>  onto a single slide from five down to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=682.389s">I</a>  didn't make that change in the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=685.589s">I</a>  just sent a screenshot of what I was proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=690.69s">I</a>  did not make a single change to your slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=694.431s">There</a>  was a little bit of discussion after that, and then it just petered off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=698.352s">You</a>  did not weigh in.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=701.412s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=703.072s">All</a>  comments should be going through the chair.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=705.813s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=708.051s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=710.653s">Why</a>  am I not seeing the raised hands?</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=714.916s">Maria</a>  has her hand up.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=717.357s">If</a>  you look at the list of participants, put that to the right hand side on your screen, you should see all the names and there's four hands raised right now.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=726.564s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=727.564s">Maria,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=730.186s">I</a>  am quite frankly very <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=733.985s">confused.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=736.246s">Every</a>  single person on the subcommittee had edit access. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=741.647s">They</a>  had the ability to make comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=745.468s">We</a>  were making comments based on what we thought needed to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=752.249s">There</a>  was absolutely no <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=755.071s">assigning</a>  of anyone to a specific name. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=758.652s">If</a>  you wanted to work on Jean Barry Sutherland, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=761.713s">But</a>  every single other subcommittee member also had the right to make edits and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=769.056s">That</a>  is how the process was working. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=773.257s">I</a>  did not receive any emails from you past the point of your having sent your full presentation, and having shortened it to four slides I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=788.456s">multiple</a>  people asked exactly what your issues were regarding the process, and you simply did not reply fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=799.821s">You</a>  did not fully express what your issues with the process were, at least not clearly to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=807.564s">If</a>  I may say so, I <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=814.42s">I</a>  understand not wanting to have your work completely edited down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=819.224s">However,</a>  I will say that the majority of your sentiments and your statements verbatim are included on what we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=831.436s">I</a>  think that in terms of collaboration, that is what a collaboration is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=840.167s">it's</a>  editing someone else's words down so that it fits better to the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=847.27s">So</a>  while I understand some of your issues with the process, I don't believe that it's a reason to be halting the entire editing process for the sake of this.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=869.158s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=870.494s">Melissa,</a>  do you have your hand up?</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=871.635s">Hi,</a>  for some reason, I don't have that function, but I did want to speak if we're speaking a point of information through the chair on process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=882.966s">I</a>  just wanted to speak to last week, I had mentioned that I feel my role on this committee is to represent the citizens of Medford, we can't have <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=893.666s">50,000</a>  people join on a Zoom call and give their input onto why or why not the Columbus School should be renamed and why or why not a name should be selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=903.09s">However,</a>  I have grave concerns with the language being used on the presentation that we are putting forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=910.413s">The</a>  school committee has asked or tasked us with putting forth a name to help heal and bring the community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=918.837s">And</a>  as we have all witnessed from day one, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=922.202s">This</a>  entire process, names that are being put forward and everything else is doing everything except bring this community together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=932.41s">The</a>  names that we are putting forward came from the input from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=938.614s">And</a>  I find it grossly alarming that one of the names that we are putting forward to the school committee did not even make it in the top three submissions from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=951.376s">There</a>  is something wrong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=953.639s">There</a>  is something wrong with this process, and it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=957.824s">And</a>  if nobody's going to say it, I'm going to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=961.588s">There's</a>  something wrong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=963.591s">Last</a>  year, a committee member put forth that he was going to name the committee, the school, after a member of this community, regardless <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=971.881s">of</a>  what any taxpayer, any community member, or any child, including mine, that sits in the classroom at the Columbus School and hella high water, he was gonna name the school that name. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=983.228s">Well,</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=984.188s">We</a>  don't live in a dictatorship. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=986.409s">And</a>  I don't find it, I don't appreciate it at all that I sit here representing my neighbors, my friends, families at the community that I consider family, and somehow a name that nobody wants <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1000.444s">is</a>  now being put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1002.486s">And</a>  that's the name on this committee that it has the most votes going forward.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1008.19s">If</a>  nobody's gonna- Point of order, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1010.232s">We</a>  took a vote and 12 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1012.994s">The</a>  majority of this committee voted to send the name forward.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1016.597s">And</a>  my issue is not- Point of order, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1019.179s">No,</a>  you're not gonna cut me off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1021.361s">You're</a>  not gonna cut me off if you don't like what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1024.804s">Nothing</a>  to do with my- If you don't like what I'm saying, you're not gonna cut me off. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1029.449s">and</a>  I will not allow you to cut me off, I will allow you to let me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1034.333s">My</a>  opinion here may not be the popular one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1037.997s">And</a>  I don't know if it's not the popular one, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1041.52s">But</a>  we're speaking on process here and I am backing up Ron's thoughts on the process and I for not one minute do not support the presentation nor the process and I want that on record.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1086.77s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1088.911s">Well,</a>  I was going to say that I didn't receive the email that Ron was referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1094.133s">If</a>  I had, I would have been happy to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1097.115s">I</a>  was looking at all of the stuff over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1099.376s">I</a>  would have been happy to continue to work on it as a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1105.278s">I</a>  mean, people are using the notes, the comment function that is built into Google <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1113.412s">what</a>  do they call their version of PowerPoint slides? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1117.554s">And</a>  I thought it was working okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1119.975s">Everything</a>  is always retrievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1121.776s">So</a>  any changes can always be undone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1125.578s">You</a>  can go back to previous versions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1129.74s">But</a>  if I had gotten that email from Ron on the 31st, I would have been happy to work on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1136.244s">I</a>  think we do all understand that the presentation does need to be <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1143.528s">consistent</a>  between the three options. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1146.489s">So</a>  changes are going to have to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1148.369s">But</a>  I think we can, if we had just discussed this at the time, it would have been, you know, I don't think it would have been too much of a chore to find a way to come together on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1160.111s">In</a>  regards to what Melissa was saying, I understand that she is saying she is taking input from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1164.892s">And</a>  I think that's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1165.992s">I</a>  think we're all here for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1168.493s">And</a>  we're all taking input from people <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1171.455s">in</a>  the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1172.856s">We</a>  all know people and we're all of the community and we should all be taking all of that into account. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1179.859s">Now</a>  we're all talking, we have different contexts in the community where we have different groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1185.141s">Everybody</a>  has different opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1186.601s">That's</a>  why we're on this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1189.663s">And</a>  when Melissa says that, you know, something wasn't, you know <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1196.41s">I'm</a>  sorry, I don't want to misquote, but I already forgot, you know, something wasn't what the people voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1201.815s">I</a>  mean, we did get a wealth of public comments, which were all fantastic to read and go through in their own way, but they were a small portion of Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1215.486s">So</a>  even just saying, well, we're not going with what those people wanted, those aren't all the people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1226.347s">both</a>  the survey and the public comments, but I think, I don't know, I think we have three excellent options and we're not making the final choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1236.991s">So</a>  I think everyone has an option that we'd be happy with. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1241.633s">I'd</a>  be happy with any of the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1244.834s">I</a>  think they're all fantastic, but I really do think we can make a good decision out of what we have if we're just more open with each other.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1253.137s">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1255.738s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1256.547s">Laura,</a>  would you like to speak very quickly just reiterate the technical piece of this, um, that I don't know how Roger Venus. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1269.468s">input</a>  got removed or changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1271.989s">But</a>  I certainly don't read anything nefarious into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1275.05s">It</a>  could have been accidental. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1276.55s">It</a>  could have been somebody misunderstanding the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1279.171s">But</a>  the beauty of Google Slides is that there's a history there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1281.832s">We</a>  can always just redo everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1284.033s">We</a>  can go back and start over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1285.853s">So</a>  I really hope that we're given the chance to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1289.615s">And</a>  I also did not receive that email. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1291.195s">And</a>  I would have reacted very much like others have said to engage in that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1295.136s">I</a>  certainly don't want anybody to feel like their work <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1297.497s">is</a>  being ignored because we're all putting so much time and effort into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1301.581s">So</a>  I hope that we can sort of go back to the slide and fix it so that everybody's voice is heard.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1308.967s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1310.148s">Seth,</a>  did you have your hand up?</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1313.831s">I</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1314.451s">I'm</a>  formally calling for orders of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1317.233s">We</a>  have specifically on the agenda that we are going to <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1323.333s">review</a>  the presentation, if there is actually a presentation.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1327.094s">Let's</a>  actually review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1329.154s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1331.015s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1332.095s">So</a>  is it now in the Google Drive?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1337.456s">I</a>  believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1338.197s">Can</a>  we bring it up? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1340.377s">Can</a>  somebody bring it up?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1344.478s">I</a>  can bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1345.978s">Do</a>  I have screen share permission? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1349.059s">No,</a>  it's only host. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1350.299s">So</a>  the host has to change it to participants. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1355.103s">which</a>  actually could get dicey. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1360.787s">If</a>  the host is able to get into the drive and share it, that would be best for Zoom security.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1366.07s">It</a>  can make you the host too, Kristen.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1368.072s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1368.332s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1391.792s">No,</a>  I'm not.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1394.453s">Oh</a>  wait, I think I got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1402.356s">Can</a>  everybody see the thank you slide?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1404.797s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1405.577s">Okay,</a>  let me go back to the beginning.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1413.56s">Mr.</a>  Chair, can a motion be made to see Ron's presentation in its entirety? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1420.202s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1421.277s">Point</a>  of order, I'd prefer just to move on, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1424.418s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1428.599s">There's</a>  enough content there that we can have a decent discussion about my slides.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1433.78s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1435.24s">As</a>  a point of clarification, do we know how much time we will have to present this?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1440.722s">I</a>  don't think there's a limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1441.702s">No</a>  one said that we have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1445.443s">How</a>  long, Ron, roughly how long does this presentation take, what we have?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1450.423s">this</a>  complete presentation?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1451.884s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1452.865s">Well,</a>  I wasn't involved in the speaker notes, so you probably should ask somebody who wrote the speaker notes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1457.828s">I'm</a>  guessing 15 minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1461.33s">So</a>  I'm not worried about time then, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1465.153s">Are</a>  we the only thing on the school committee agenda when it gets presented? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1469.576s">I</a>  know that there's time limits with them having the Zoom account.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1476.24s">No,</a>  I don't think we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1477.221s">This</a>  is Kathy Kay, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1478.442s">I</a>  don't think we're the only thing on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1485.237s">There's</a>  just 30 slides, so I don't think 15 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1488.739s">I</a>  don't think we're going to make it in 15 minutes.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1493.422s">Well,</a>  and then our script could be different than what's on the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1497.165s">Sometimes</a>  that's an approach that people take. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1499.847s">So</a>  we just want to make sure we have enough time to share the right amount of info. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1504.53s">But</a>  tell me when you guys want me to move to another slide.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1507.512s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1514.147s">just</a>  point of order, can we make that any bigger? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1516.308s">I</a>  mean, I think the comments are really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1520.33s">The</a>  comments all need to be addressed, if they need to be.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1526.954s">Is</a>  that, it kind of pushes them down and gets them out of frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1531.056s">Is</a>  that any better?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1531.757s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just old. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1534.198s">I</a>  have my cheaters.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1537.099s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1539.04s">I</a>  have the same one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1541.902s">That's</a>  that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1543.403s">How's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1545.18s">It</a>  just takes them out of frame, unfortunately.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1550.281s">I</a>  think once it's up on being projected, it'll be big enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1553.262s">I</a>  just think, unfortunately, on our small screens right now, it looks smaller than it will be.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1557.223s">Let</a>  me see if I can get rid of the sidebar.</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1558.803s">I</a>  was going to say, it looks pretty OK on a 36-inch monitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1562.484s">Stop</a>  bragging.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1566.725s">It's</a>  also not in present mode.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1569.466s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1571.046s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1571.426s">I'm</a>  so used to PowerPoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1572.646s">Is</a>  this present mode, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1574.027s">No,</a>  that's explore.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1576.338s">It's</a>  the white box up here.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1579.179s">This</a>  one?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1579.96s">Well,</a>  I just think if you hit present, you're going to lose the comment section.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1583.822s">Oh,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1584.642s">Ron's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1585.302s">I</a>  will lose the comment.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1586.083s">I</a>  think that people are able to zoom in onto the screen by clicking next to where it says you are viewing Kristen Scalise's screen or it says view options, zoom ratio. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1601.129s">And</a>  there's different percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1603.55s">So</a>  that might make it easier to read.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1614.961s">Okay,</a>  just let me know where you guys want me to go.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1616.481s">Okay,</a>  so on bullet point number four, I had said that those names, if our names are going to be listed in alphabetical order by last name, it should be Mr. Tuck, Dean Barry Sutherland, Belinda Sutton, and additional recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1632.746s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1633.526s">I</a>  think everything should be in alphabetical order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1635.486s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1637.247s">For</a>  consistency, I think.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1640.267s">Can</a>  I ask why additional recommendations is there? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1645.333s">I</a>  mean, three is three.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1646.274s">I</a>  think someone had pointed out that if there was a way to honor all of the options, all 18, that we would suggest that the school might wanna look into doing that.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1661.148s">But</a>  that wasn't, I read that, but that wasn't what we were set to do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1667.875s">We</a>  would come back with three and only three.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1670.723s">Aren't</a>  they going to have that information anyway? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1673.024s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1673.645s">Be</a>  a top 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1674.105s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1675.946s">So</a>  I get rid of additional recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1678.467s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1680.068s">Sorry,</a>  this is Matt Amherstro. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1681.929s">Thanks,</a>  Matt.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1684.01s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1685.03s">Yeah,</a>  it was hard to alphabetize, because mistletoe is just a word. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1688.972s">So</a>  then you start thinking, well, alphabetize by first word.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1694.916s">I</a>  think it should be mistletoe, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Belinda Sutton, as I had noted on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1700.19s">Yeah,</a>  I am.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1706.195s">Should</a>  I move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1711.939s">Mr.</a>  Chair, there's a motion tonight for an additional recommendation, so.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1718.525s">That</a>  motion's out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1719.966s">I</a>  already took care of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1722.188s">That</a>  can go to the school committee or the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1724.81s">That</a>  has nothing to do with our scope of what we're doing.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1731.368s">That's</a>  what you're being out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1733.589s">It's</a>  on the formal, it's on the formal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1736.67s">It's</a>  out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1739.972s">How</a>  did it get on the agenda if it's out of order?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1744.874s">Someone</a>  put it on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1749.716s">Anyone</a>  on this committee has the ability to bring a motion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1752.917s">You</a>  don't decide that a motion is out of order.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1756.803s">It</a>  has nothing to do with what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1760.545s">And</a>  that's what the committee would then decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1763.047s">It's</a>  not deciding. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1763.907s">There's</a>  the chair, I'm telling you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1765.288s">It</a>  has nothing to do with what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1767.589s">I</a>  guess you don't understand the responsibility of the chair.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1771.031s">You're</a>  not the person to determine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1772.892s">Go</a>  to the city council with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1774.273s">It</a>  doesn't have anything to do with what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1777.155s">It's</a>  not your job as the chair to decide what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1780.277s">It's</a>  for the committee to decide.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1783.038s">My</a>  job is to decide what the committee gets to decide on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1787.39s">That</a>  is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1788.211s">It</a>  is tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1790.912s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1792.193s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1794.514s">Can</a>  we hear the motion?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1795.815s">We</a>  also on the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1828.565s">We</a>  all sit with this slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1830.007s">Everybody</a>  agree on this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1833.891s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1836.534s">Can</a>  we go to the next one, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1863.996s">Everyone</a>  agree on this one?</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1869.938s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1871.538s">I'm</a>  not double checking the dates, but it looks fine.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1879.04s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1879.42s">Go</a>  to the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1881.941s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1913.875s">This</a>  one look okay to everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1915.856s">Okay,</a>  can we go to the next one?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1943.815s">So</a>  this is Matt Haberstrom. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1945.616s">I'm</a>  assuming Grace is going to explain this rubric to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1950.758s">Yes,</a>  I would like that.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1952.679s">Since</a>  she created it and they can get a good handle on what the scoring is all about.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1957.422s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1959.283s">Grace.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1960.143s">I'm</a>  happy to do that if that's what you would like, yes.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1962.805s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1964.425s">OK,</a>  does this look fine to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1966.517s">A</a>  point of information on that last slide, the 66 names, we arrived at that 66 after actually removing some names using the process that we voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1980.42s">I</a>  don't know that it needs to be articulated here, but there were some other names that did not make that list of 66, if that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1992.402s">So</a>  it was an additional step as part of our process.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1995.17s">What</a>  did we take off? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=1996.791s">We</a>  took off the people who were still alive.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2000.374s">And</a>  the ones that weren't entered in good faith, like Vito Corleone.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2006.598s">So</a>  anyone have a problem with leaving at 66?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2010.64s">Maybe</a>  just a rewording, like after reviewing the community survey, we created a list of unique name suggestions, 66 suggestions based on that input or <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2026.182s">something</a>  like that.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2027.683s">That</a>  sounds good.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2029.163s">I</a>  want to acknowledge the survey because it was very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2032.784s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2036.406s">Now</a>  I can't remember what it was so important that we ignore it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2040.427s">I</a>  didn't ignore anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2041.508s">I</a>  read every single through the every single entry, please.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2046.37s">Can</a>  we correct that first line of that Senate? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2049.251s">First</a>  bullet statement that</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2051.069s">Yeah,</a>  I feel like there should be some mention that there was more than 66 names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2055.391s">This</a>  is Matt again.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2056.832s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2057.793s">And</a>  that didn't we vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2058.833s">I</a>  mean, I don't know if we want to put this in there, but didn't we vote to take off the living members of this list?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2064.536s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2065.157s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2065.957s">I</a>  don't know if we want to mention that to let people know that that's one reason why that's one reason where a lot of them got knocked off.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2075.582s">Are</a>  we going to mention the survey that was done?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2079.204s">I</a>  believe it's in a</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2080.982s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2084.083s">This</a>  is the process step-by-step as we went through it.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2089.265s">So</a>  I can't remember what I said.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2093.947s">I</a>  think you said like after the committee reviewed the results of the community survey, we generated a list of 66 names.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2105.612s">Mr.</a>  LaFleur, very good.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2108.892s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2114.774s">So</a>  do we want to put in more of the methodology with how we narrowed it?</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2118.896s">I</a>  think saying that we omitted living people is probably an important.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2129.642s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2130.982s">Couldn't</a>  the person who's doing this slide, put that in the notes and add it?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2134.964s">Yeah,</a>  we can add it there.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2137.732s">Should</a>  I just put a... Just a clarification, in the notes already, it does say the first reduction of the list was to remove living, current living suggestions, and then the remain, like, it kind of walks through some of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2160.559s">So</a>  if you want to open up the talking points,</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2166.841s">Okay,</a>  so yeah, like it could be possibly in the script.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2171.404s">And</a>  then alter it as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2173.245s">It</a>  was just kind of a way to help frame everything.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2178.508s">Yeah,</a>  and I guess we'll have to go through that soon because the script could highlight different info than the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2189.675s">Okay,</a>  should I go to the next one? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2191.557s">And</a>  we'll work on that after? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2198.817s">Or</a>  someone else could pop in and edit while I'm driving the slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2206.8s">So</a>  we're good on the rubric, right?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2210.622s">Everybody</a>  good on the rubric? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2212.242s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2213.263s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2229.866s">This</a>  is Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2230.947s">On</a>  this slide, should we name, should we put Dela Russa's name in there so people aren't wondering who was that name that was accidentally left off?</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2241.314s">I</a>  would say no, because I think that takes out the neutrality.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2247.279s">I</a>  agree.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2252.663s">And</a>  the committee is going to have the list of 18 anyway, won't they?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2255.525s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2262.131s">And</a>  all of our proceedings are public documents and public records, so they have access to what happened.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2270.815s">They</a>  can also just ask, and we can tell them, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2274.236s">I</a>  think as long as whoever is presenting the slide knows that information, it's information that we can freely give them without hesitation.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2281.139s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2285.581s">Is</a>  everyone good with this slide?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2288.322s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2288.862s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2289.763s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2291.477s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2292.217s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2294.258s">Do</a>  we have to go back and look at the last one? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2296.439s">Has</a>  the last one been fixed or are we gonna go back to it later? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2305.261s">Too</a>  bad, that was being changed.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2317.677s">Well,</a>  I think the question here is, do we want to change it on the slide or do we want to add it to the script? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2324.422s">Because</a>  it's always, it's pretty much standard that you put less info on the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2331.627s">At</a>  least this is what I've heard in every single PowerPoint class I've taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2334.589s">Less</a>  info on the slide so that people's eyes aren't all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2340.013s">And</a>  then you put additional info in the narration or the script.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2348.7s">All</a>  right, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2351.021s">We'll</a>  leave it like that.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2352.101s">I</a>  have no preference.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2353.941s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2355.822s">All</a>  right, can we go back?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2357.562s">Okay,</a>  where were we? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2359.263s">We</a>  were good on this?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2360.543s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2369.085s">Mr.</a>  Chair, I'd like to speak on this slide, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2373.973s">I</a>  don't think we should have this slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2376.495s">I</a>  think it is misleading. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2379.497s">We</a>  were not tasked with counting votes, because these were not votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2383.761s">We</a>  were tasked with reading every single submission, doing our own research and coming up with the rubric and that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2391.588s">giving</a>  these numbers, I mean the numbers are public, they will be given to the school committee, any member of the public can access those numbers, they can access all of the numbers that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2402.45s">I</a>  think this slide makes it seem like it was an election, and it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2408.071s">And</a>  so I would say that this slide is misleading in itself.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2413.232s">Point</a>  of information through the chair, as somebody who is sitting on this committee, strongly, strongly, strongly, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2421.767s">advocating</a>  for community input and community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2425.089s">I</a>  think it is extremely important that we let the community know how their feedback was taken and what they submitted and what was submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2434.353s">Somebody</a>  used the word mock. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2439.135s">And</a>  I said, if we are not gonna present the community with what they provided to us, this is extremely misleading.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2449.457s">kind</a>  of information to the chair, all of our information, including all of the things that we just voted on last week to send to this school committee, our public record, every single document that we've created, every single thing that we've done, every single rubric that each individual has taken, every single, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2471.978s">submission</a>  from the public, all of those are public documents.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2475.92s">So</a>  then point of information to the chair, there's no reason why we can't summarize it here for the community who doesn't have time to go through a Google Doc drive that has thousands and thousands of documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2488.225s">We</a>  were barely able to do that in the time that we were given.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2490.666s">One</a>  of the time please.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2496.741s">It's</a>  interesting, whenever I speak about community input and supporting and using the community, I get spoken over and I really find that to be alarming and I'm just really disgusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2507.33s">So</a>  all I'm going to say is it is extremely important to me that we listen to the community and we let them know what we heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2514.716s">And</a>  what we heard on here, it doesn't say anything about votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2518.419s">All</a>  it says is the number of submissions that was received for each name. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2523.267s">And</a>  I will continue to fight and continue to speak on behalf of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2528.231s">And</a>  that's what this slide means to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2530.073s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2530.574s">Information</a>  to the chair.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2532.535s">This</a>  is Kathy K. Yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2534.497s">But</a>  I then think we would need to have all of the names with how many submissions there were like Lydia. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2540.788s">Child,</a>  Marie Child, those names, none of those are on this slide.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2544.551s">Point</a>  of information to Mrs. Kaye through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2546.913s">When</a>  I developed this slide, there was a next bullet that said, and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2550.856s">I</a>  just didn't have time to go through and put every name. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2555.2s">So</a>  I agree with Miss Kaye. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2557.282s">That</a>  line that I had in there was taken out.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2560.564s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2561.305s">Go</a>  ahead, Rob. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2562.986s">Ann,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2564.402s">No,</a>  let Ron call. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2565.242s">I'll</a>  go after Ron.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2566.143s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2566.723s">Thanks,</a>  Dan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2567.303s">I</a>  mean, we've been going through this for four weeks now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2571.665s">I</a>  understand the frustration you heard from me at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2574.667s">However,</a>  this was never a vote, and it's been miscommunicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2578.989s">It's</a>  not a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2579.709s">What</a>  I do suggest is there is significance in this number for the three people that we chose, Gene Barry Sutherland, Belinda Sutton, and Missituk. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2588.694s">In</a>  my 14-page presentation, I wrote <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2593.002s">This</a>  disclaimer, while this number does not have any significance in terms of a vote or total legitimate entries, it is important to note that this was a search for positive and negative antidotes and feedback on each candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2607.408s">So</a>  if you wanna put percentage, I wouldn't even count, I'd put Jean Barry Sutherland got 34% of the feedback, but that disclaimer has to be there because we're just perpetuating this, what it's not, and it's not a vote, period.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2625.483s">Okay,</a>  thank you, Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2626.484s">For</a>  information, Jim, just want to make a quick comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2629.607s">If</a>  we're being true to the process and we're showing how we got where we got and this was part of the process, I think it's important that we keep that in there and let them know that this was part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2643.119s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2643.54s">Through</a>  the chair, I'd like to make a motion to keep this slide.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2647.484s">I</a>  second that motion.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2649.409s">All</a>  right, further discussion here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2651.451s">I</a>  see hands up and then we'll take a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2653.312s">Laura,</a>  would you like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2654.473s">I've</a>  already spoken, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2657.976s">Seth,</a>  do you got a hand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2663.721s">Seth,</a>  do I see a hand up?</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2665.502s">You</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2667.704s">I</a>  guess, are we specifically speaking to this motion that has now been made to keep this?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2674.129s">We</a>  have a motion to accept this slide.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2676.271s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2679.094s">So</a>  are we going to go through each particular thing on the presentation as a whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2687.096s">I</a>  guess I'm a little unclear as to a parliamentary thing because are we, you know, I mean, there's other edits that we're going to be making. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2699.358s">On</a>  this slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2703.019s">No,</a>  I guess I'm just asking important information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2705.56s">So</a>  we are having a vote.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2709.69s">individual</a>  slides so right now every up until now we've we've pretty much agreed on the slides now this slide we have a little disagreement we have a motion we'll see you know the vote we'll see who if the slide stays or goes all right um maybe i'll let patrick uh weigh in here if you would so choose because i think what we may be facing is that we have asked a subcommittee to bring this to us and</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2740.587s">that</a>  might have some parliamentary issues from a standpoint as to whether or not we're going to then, as a committee, change what we had tasked the- We're going to take this forward as a committee, and that's, we tasked some committee to bring it to us so we could do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2759.196s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2759.736s">So</a>  from my standpoint, I think that the information has already been passed through <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2772.302s">I</a>  think that presenting it here is misleading and doesn't serve a purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2781.032s">And</a>  so I would strongly recommend it being removed.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2785.737s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2786.297s">Patrick,</a>  you got any comment?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2788.62s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2792.38s">When</a>  we asked for input from the community, it was specifically stated that this was not a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2799.302s">In</a>  fact, when one of our committee members resigned, one of the issues that was brought forward was that he had stated something about this being a vote and multiple people took offense to saying it's a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2814.746s">Now</a>  people are saying it is a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2817.251s">It</a>  wasn't a vote before, now it is a vote, or now it's just stating what the submissions are.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2822.112s">I</a>  didn't hear them say it's a vote, I heard them say it's submissions.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2825.873s">Okay,</a>  even if it's submissions, we didn't go through and we did not call the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2831.294s">I</a>  took a look at the list, there's people on here saying, in the survey we asked them what their relationship was to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2839.396s">Somebody</a>  there said my boyfriend lives in Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2842.777s">Someone</a>  else said that they knew one of the candidates because they were in sewing club together. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2848.678s">Multiple</a>  people said they're former residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2852.539s">So</a>  we didn't go through and call this list to see whether or not this, you know, how many submissions were accurately represented as people of the Medford community.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2863.841s">A</a>  point of information to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2866.661s">If</a>  we weren't going to allow, if we weren't going to accept certain submissions, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2871.632s">then</a>  it should have indicated that if you did not meet this criteria, then you could not provide feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2877.415s">We</a>  can't start now eliminating feedback based on criteria that we're setting in the 11th hour.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2883.658s">No</a>  argument here, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2886.279s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2887.36s">Kathy</a>  Kaye, would you like to speak next?</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2891.107s">Yes,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2892.128s">I</a>  think I just need to reiterate that if in fact we're gonna have this slide, it should have all of the names with how many submissions they got, not just the first five or however many are there.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2903.456s">If</a>  we want it to be- That would be an amendment.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2908.079s">I</a>  would second that amendment, Kathy.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2912.182s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2914.864s">Grace,</a>  would you like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2916.918s">Yeah,</a>  I just, clarification, I think, I just wanted to go back to what Ron had stated about how he had, in his longer presentation, he had provided this information, but in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2935.553s">And</a>  I was wondering if that was an amendment to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2941.318s">I'm</a>  not quite sure where we stand procedurally, but, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2948.169s">if</a>  we're voting on this slide versus a suggestion that Ron had made to clarify some of the numbers that were on here.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2956.775s">I</a>  have an amendment and I have a motion here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2964.721s">Ron,</a>  was that an amendment or?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2968.864s">Well,</a>  I mean, you know me in procedure, I'm always behind, but yeah, it's an amendment and here's the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2977.189s">The</a>  only information that's valid here are the three finalists. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2981.127s">I</a>  think instead of putting a number, I think a percentage, and I also think the disclaimer has to be on here that I just read, has to be on there, because that's what it was, seeking information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2992.393s">And</a>  I think we forget that there were multiple people entering submissions multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=2998.116s">I</a>  think there were multiple people just saying, I like this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3001.498s">The</a>  goal of that whole effort was for people to submit positive and negative information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3008.662s">I</a>  think I would offer an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3010.404s">I</a>  would support this slide if it said only the three names, the percentages, people can figure out how much was not what was the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3018.872s">And</a>  the disclaimer that I read that this was definitely not a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3023.055s">I</a>  mean, that's what we voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3024.356s">As</a>  much as I'd love to do it the other way, that's what we voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3027.678s">And</a>  I also suggest that going forward to the next slide, people can offer friendly amendments, which has been the procedure for this committee since its beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3035.583s">You</a>  accept the amendment, we make the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3037.444s">These</a>  really are amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3038.845s">This</a>  is not, we, subcommittee did not come up with a final presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3043.288s">The</a>  whole committee will approve this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3045.649s">So</a>  friendly amendments, and then if it gets stuck, we have to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3049.251s">That's</a>  the process.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3051.52s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3052.801s">So</a>  we have an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3053.881s">First</a>  of all, we have an amendment to add all the names to this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3059.144s">We're</a>  going to vote that up or down.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3061.945s">Kristen</a>  has her hand up.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3064.366s">As</a>  do I. Sorry, I've lost the little hand thingy because I'm screen sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3071.61s">I</a>  don't know where it went. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3074.231s">I</a>  just want to say, I don't know why we started. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3079.762s">arguing,</a>  well, maybe not arguing on this one, but we didn't even address the comments that were there from the subcommittee where Grace just wanted to, her comment is, can we move the slide up to slide eight? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3090.087s">We</a>  wanted to know if that made sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3092.288s">And</a>  then Maria brought up in the comments, should the other 13 be included or top five? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3097.371s">So</a>  in the subcommittee, I don't even think we were talking about removing it, but maybe we should address the comments that we had <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3109.147s">earlier</a>  before we, I have no problem with leaving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3115.03s">And</a>  I think in Turan's case, this would be a place where we could use the script for the presentation to be more detailed about how the process went and yeah, give some of the background that he suggested.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3132.759s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3136.801s">Seth?</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3139.307s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to reiterate that from a standpoint of how this committee was given its charter, it's our job to come up with the three names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3155.134s">And</a>  yes, community feedback and the submissions were a part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3161.217s">But</a>  at the end of the day, when we have done our job, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3169.472s">they</a>  are no longer the part of the, they are no longer the part of our job that necessarily needs to have representation in form of this that looks like a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3188.521s">And</a>  I think it just gives the wrong impression that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3196.712s">it</a>  doesn't give the clearest picture of what our job was. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3200.993s">And</a>  I think that that's the most important part. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3205.355s">For</a>  a presentation that is supposed to say, these are the three names, this is how we determined our names, that's what the presentation's for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3219.8s">This</a>  is specifically the- The question is whether we're leaving the slide or taking it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3227.249s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3227.651s">And</a>  it's the community slide.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3228.977s">It's</a>  not the committee slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3230.344s">And</a>  that's my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3231.76s">Jim,</a>  point of information again, this is part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3235.221s">I'm</a>  just confused as to why we're even discussing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3238.901s">It</a>  was part of the process that we got community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3241.702s">Why</a>  are we gonna eliminate the community feedback portion? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3245.203s">I</a>  get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3246.023s">It</a>  looks like there was a lot of votes for Gene Barry and a lot less for the other two that are going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3251.464s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3252.484s">However,</a>  it was part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3254.724s">Community</a>  feedback was part of what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3258.185s">So</a>  to eliminate this, I think we're doing a big injustice to the whole process and to the folks that took their time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3267.172s">Where</a>  the 423 people submitted for Gene Barry and whatever percentage of them doubled or faked it or whatever, this was what we got and this is what we're showing you we got. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3281.303s">You</a>  know, I just don't understand why we're still kind of discussing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3284.945s">It's,</a>  it's part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3286.725s">We're</a>  showing them the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3288.286s">Can</a>  we move on? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3290.867s">You</a>  call the move the vote.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3294.409s">I</a>  think we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3295.809s">There</a>  are still a lot of hands up for discussion, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3298.931s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3308.635s">Patrick.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3311.459s">My</a>  concern with this slide is it sends a message that there was a vote and that this committee did not take it to consider.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3322.124s">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3322.825s">Don't</a>  use the word vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3323.805s">It's</a>  submissions.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3325.006s">Yeah,</a>  I know that.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3325.906s">But</a>  what just happened.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3330.257s">When</a>  Danny just spoke, as he used the word vote, people are going to use the word vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3335.0s">I</a>  wish they wouldn't, but they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3337.402s">And</a>  that's what this slide is gonna be perceived as. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3340.524s">And</a>  when Melissa gave her presentation, she said she was gonna pick the three people that received the most votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3348.189s">If</a>  we check the notes, despite the fact that the motion specifically states that these are not votes, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3357.378s">It's</a>  gonna be perceived as a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3359.299s">And</a>  this is going out into the community perceived as a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3362.781s">And</a>  some people in the community didn't think of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3365.102s">Most</a>  people didn't think of it as a vote, but now it's gonna be presented as such and be held against either this committee or the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3374.246s">And</a>  that- Jim, put up information, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3376.407s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3378.314s">Let's</a>  all be realistic here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3380.555s">Let's</a>  not think for one second, the school committee, who is gonna be voting on this, doesn't know about this list, whether you call it submissions, votes, whatever it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3389.219s">The</a>  school committee is aware of this list, and I don't care what anybody tells me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3394.102s">So</a>  for us to take it out when it was part of our process, you can even eliminate the names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3400.485s">We're</a>  just showing them what we did as part of our process, and this is what came back.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3406.767s">Okay,</a>  so I would agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3408.508s">All</a>  right, let's not talk about this one all night, stop.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3412.432s">Point</a>  of information, if you looked back at slide seven, it does detail the steps that we took in order to receive public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3422.619s">You</a>  can see that there were 17 names, we put out a survey, it was translated, members could submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3430.45s">there</a>  was a limit to what they could say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3432.431s">And</a>  we did receive over 1,200 online responses and 39 paper responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3437.753s">So</a>  the only thing that this slide doesn't detail right now is the list of names and how those got broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3444.516s">So</a>  I think it's a little disingenuous to state that we're not stating how we got community input when this in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3453.24s">does</a>  already discuss the process as to what we did to get the community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3459.483s">Additionally,</a>  later on, when you get to the specific names, there are comments that have been pulled from the community input in order to support some of the specific names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3472.11s">So</a>  it's incorporated throughout this presentation, I think in various ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3478.895s">It's</a>  still there, whether it's as explicit as the slide, it's not, but I think it's been incorporated in this and in other ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3490.486s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3492.167s">Melissa,</a>  your hand up.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3495.62s">Yes,</a>  point of information through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3497.321s">The</a>  reason that I added this slide, I don't care if we put submissions, I don't care if we put tally marks, I don't care if we say lollipops were submitted for these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3505.669s">I</a>  think it's crucial that we ask the community for input and the results of their input and their time should be presented to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3515.137s">I</a>  agree with, I think it was Ron who said, put a disclaimer, these are not votes, they were not utilized as votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3522.508s">And</a>  yes, Patrick, last week I did say that my role here is to listen to the community and I will listen to them and I will support the names that came in with the three highest submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3533.415s">So</a>  you are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3534.896s">I</a>  did not going by votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3536.777s">I'm</a>  going based on the feedback and the number of people who spent their time to commit to this process in a democratic way and they want their voices to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3547.724s">So</a>  I think it was a gross failure on the part of the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3551.778s">if</a>  it was to task us with this with no public engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3560.782s">And</a>  so I would like that to be on the record that I don't care if these are votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3564.264s">I</a>  don't care if these are handed out lollipops. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3566.245s">I</a>  don't care what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3567.565s">These</a>  are voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3568.526s">We</a>  can say 423 voices were heard, but it's crucial that we ask for community input and the community sees what we heard.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3578.47s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3582.495s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3582.816s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3585.48s">I</a>  don't see any more hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3586.822s">We're</a>  all set here.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3588.144s">I</a>  leave myself.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3590.808s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3599.7s">If</a>  I'm just going to jump in, just because. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3602.343s">Is</a>  that okay?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3603.204s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3604.125s">I</a>  was just wondering if it might make everybody feel better that rather than say number of submissions and like Melissa was saying, it doesn't matter if it says lollipop. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3611.433s">So</a>  maybe we just say number of feedback forms collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3617.54s">If</a>  that makes people feel better about this.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3623.778s">And</a>  I was just going to say that, you know, there are a lot of slides in this presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3628.801s">And</a>  while I may not be delivering the presentation, ultimately, we may need to reduce the number of slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3636.164s">And</a>  so I think having a list of all the names and all the submissions that basically replicates the data set that we're turning over to the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3644.688s">might</a>  be overkill in this case. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3646.569s">I</a>  do agree we should have some community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3649.11s">I</a>  think Dr. Grace suggested that maybe that is actually the public participation slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3654.733s">If</a>  we want to have this slide, perhaps Ron's suggestion of just some percentages with our three names, but I think adding a whole list, the entire list with all the submissions is an extra slide and you're not going to have much time in the presentation to spend on that detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3670.601s">And</a>  we're already handing over that data to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3674.208s">Can</a>  I ask how many slides in total? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3679.209s">It's</a>  Lisa.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3679.809s">25,</a>  I think.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3680.649s">I</a>  think some of these at the bottom are extra.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3685.91s">23,</a>  and then the ones at the bottom are just recovered slides.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3693.091s">That</a>  might be worked back in.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3697.152s">So</a>  between 20 and 25, so you're thinking about a 25 minute presentation approximately?</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3703.847s">Probably</a>  closer to two minutes per slide.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3705.67s">I</a>  think you're gonna have to get clarification from the superintendent, because I think that my beach time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3715.985s">So</a>  I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3719.456s">I'm</a>  not positive, but I believe that you're going to have to get clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3724.16s">I</a>  don't think anyone's made that long of a presentation in front of the committee, but again, the superintendent's office would have to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3730.945s">I</a>  think it's too long because it's a regular meeting, so there's other things on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3737.801s">I'm</a>  just going to touch base with Dr. Cushing and he'll probably jump in at some point to kind of, I think they will look in between five and 10 minutes, but again, I can't be quoted because I'm not the rule maker, but I do know 25 minutes could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3755.127s">So</a>  I'll try to get Dr. Cushing in the meantime for clarification, but I just want to throw it out there folks, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3760.749s">I'm</a>  always the bearer of bad news.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3764.27s">Can</a>  I make a comment on the community feedback slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3768.725s">What</a>  if we just added the, I have no problem with the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3772.167s">What</a>  if we just added the context in case people forget the number and just say close to 1,300 members of the Medford community decided to share feedback out of that and then just give them the starting number and then the submission numbers make more sense in context. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3794.445s">I</a>  have no other issue with this slide, unless of course, as Lisa said, it comes down to time.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3799.667s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3800.587s">Yes,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3802.027s">I</a>  think the side comment that Dr. Grace is the correct one, we can list these numbers and then a description of the process already includes 1,200 plus submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3812.49s">I</a>  think we give this, maybe tweak a little bit the disclaimer part of it with this next slide, as opposed to the before slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3822.073s">And</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3825.863s">just</a>  while I have the five minutes for this presentation, I might as well just fold it in an envelope and hand it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3831.946s">25</a>  minutes is the minimum we're gonna use. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3838.108s">Just</a>  five minutes is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3840.309s">But</a>  anyway, switching that slide to number eight makes more sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3845.21s">That</a>  way, Dr. Grace can add the disclaimer again, or it's already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3852.515s">We</a>  move on, everything's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3854.036s">Whether</a>  you want, to me, three names, percentage, is, you know, Jean Barry Sutherland got 34% of the feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3863.502s">Belinda</a>  Sutton got 12% of the feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3866.424s">Mr.</a>  Tuck got 12% of the feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3868.625s">Let's</a>  go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3869.786s">We</a>  haven't even got to substance yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3871.787s">I</a>  agree with Melissa.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3873.328s">This</a>  is important information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3874.789s">Can</a>  we take back the, rescind the amendment and the motion and go with Ron's?</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3882.282s">Um,</a>  I've had my hand raised for quite a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3885.924s">I</a>  speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3887.025s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3888.305s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3889.006s">I'd</a>  like to reiterate what's been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3892.127s">This</a>  information will be public record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3894.689s">The</a>  school committee will already have access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3897.21s">The</a>  public will already have access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3900.031s">To</a>  be quite honest, it feels like a <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3903.349s">logical</a>  fallacy to be providing these numbers, but because regardless of whether you say, okay, yes, this was not a vote, this was simply feedback, I don't think that you can really qualify submissions that said nothing but N-A or completely blank or people ranting about why the Columbus school name should not be changed anyways in these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3933.32s">I</a>  don't think that that is an accurate representation of the community's feedback regardless, especially considering the fact that this is a very limited scope of the people in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3946.673s">I</a>  feel as though, regardless of whether we have the slide or not, the school committee is going to see this information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3954.864s">So</a>  it feels like if we're presenting this to the public, if that is the point of this, if that is the point of this presentation, in addition to presenting to the school committee, it just simply feels like a logical fallacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3972.769s">It</a>  feels unnecessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3974.11s">It</a>  feels like it's going to be misleading regardless of whether we have that caveat that this was not a vote or not.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3983.58s">Point</a>  of information through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3985.101s">First</a>  of all, I find it extremely disrespectful to say that people who do not want the name of the Columbus change to be ranting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3992.564s">So</a>  I wanna put that on the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=3994.945s">And</a>  second, if this information is gonna be in black and white in front of the school committee, that's fabulous. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4000.248s">But</a>  again, gonna back my stance that this is, we are gonna have the public watching that and they're not gonna have the packet that the school committee is going to have in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4009.132s">This</a>  information is crucial. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4012.087s">to</a>  be shared. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4013.508s">Again,</a>  many people on this committee seem to not understand the importance of community input, and it's very, very alarming to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4022.931s">And</a>  I don't understand why there's such a hesitation to provide information, but not 423 voices were heard, good, bad, or indifferent for these names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4034.676s">The</a>  community deserves to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4037.517s">I</a>  feel like I'm talking to a wall.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4041.988s">Lisa,</a>  have you got your hand up?</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4047.632s">Jim,</a>  can we move this to the vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4050.254s">You</a>  call the vote.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4050.994s">Sorry,</a>  I shouldn't have it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4053.436s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4055.378s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4057.379s">This</a>  is Brie, I've had my hand up for quite a while now.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4060.161s">He</a>  called the vote, Brie.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4061.782s">Okay,</a>  what is the vote to keep it?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4063.583s">That's</a>  what I'd like to know, what are we voting on? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4065.685s">To</a>  keep it, yes, to keep it, no, it's out.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4069.015s">Point</a>  of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4069.695s">Before</a>  we take a vote, we would have to vote two-thirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4073.598s">Calling</a>  the vote requires a vote of two-thirds to close debate.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4079.581s">He</a>  called the vote.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4080.902s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4081.202s">That</a>  requires a vote of two-thirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4084.104s">It's</a>  not debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4085.144s">So</a>  we need to take a vote first on whether or not we call the vote, whether or not we close debate.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4097.175s">If</a>  not, debate is still open, and people need to be recognized to talk.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4103.997s">I</a>  think we've had enough discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4105.278s">We're</a>  going to go to the vote.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4107.258s">Can</a>  I ask a clarifying question, Jim?</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4109.359s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4110.119s">That's</a>  not according to the Robert rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4112.08s">That's</a>  a point of order.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4114.321s">Go</a>  ahead, Kathy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4115.641s">Are</a>  these five questions the one that got the top five submission responses? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4121.403s">Is</a>  that why these five are there specifically?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4125.424s">I</a>  believe so.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4126.745s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4128.5s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4131.182s">Okay,</a>  on the motion, Brie.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4134.263s">Ken,</a>  I just have some clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4136.685s">I'm</a>  so sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4137.405s">Are</a>  we voting on the slide as is, or are we voting on the slide with Ron's suggestions? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4147.251s">I</a>  would just like to have a formal understanding of what exactly about this slide I'm voting on, yes or no.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4153.354s">To</a>  get to Ron's suggestion, we need to vote this down and go to Ron's suggestion, I would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4158.56s">No,</a>  that was a friendly amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4160.761s">Was</a>  it actually?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4161.941s">It's</a>  an amendment to this slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4164.161s">And</a>  I just want to reiterate to Melissa, this is an opportunity for us to keep this information on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4171.163s">I</a>  cannot support it this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4173.143s">I</a>  do believe moving it to the eighth slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4175.484s">And</a>  then once again, this is our opportunity to educate the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4181.425s">And</a>  the fact is we appreciate the community input was invaluable because I didn't know any of these candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4188.932s">However,</a>  it was never a vote, and I think it's our opportunity to say that, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4196.321s">Otherwise,</a>  I just don't see the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4198.604s">Your</a>  choices are to sweeten it or eliminate it, in my opinion, so.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4203.56s">point</a>  of information through the chair I just want everybody to know that I was also under the impression that we were kind of drafting these slides, I felt that this information was important to share, and my kind of draft of the slide was just I would like to discuss this information and how it should be presented in no way shape or form at any point did I feel that my <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4222.296s">slide</a>  and the information that I provided was set in stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4225.559s">Like</a>  I said, we can change it to voices, we can change it to whatever we want to change it, but the point of my slide was to get something down and my passion behind listening to and respecting the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4236.991s">However</a>  we want to present it, you wanted to move it to number eight, that doesn't matter to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4241.555s">I</a>  don't care where we present it or how we present it, it was more just, can we please work off of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4247.174s">and</a>  value my strong belief that the community needs to be heard regardless of if it's, thank you for taking your time to fill out a Google poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4256.897s">But</a>  it's, I will not change my stance on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4259.838s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4260.678s">Point</a>  of information, Melissa, I agree with what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4263.919s">I</a>  just think it needs to be done in a way that we reiterate, it wasn't a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4269.321s">It</a>  was extremely valuable information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4271.261s">It</a>  was an education and that's what it was meant to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4274.045s">opinions</a>  of way to vote go right to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4277.466s">That's</a>  not us.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4278.547s">So</a>  I think information, Ron, I'm agreeing with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4281.608s">I</a>  know that you agree with me.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4282.888s">Can</a>  we do that to this slide right now?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4285.269s">Let's</a>  just move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4286.409s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4286.869s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4287.53s">Again,</a>  slide what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4292.091s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4293.132s">Mr.</a>  Chair.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4294.032s">So</a>  who's got the power to change the wording?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4298.794s">Can</a>  I just drag like I would in PowerPoint on the left? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4301.995s">I</a>  don't want to break anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4304.075s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4304.335s">Yes,</a>  you can drag. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4305.156s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4306.337s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4306.777s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4307.978s">And</a>  then do we want to add any any wording? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4310.36s">I</a>  think Ron had some nice suggestions before.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4313.262s">Can</a>  we can we see the slide before? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4315.824s">So</a>  I understand the public.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4317.805s">Sorry,</a>  I think I'm on it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4319.126s">It</a>  should say community feedback at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4321.468s">Are</a>  you seeing my screen?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4322.449s">I</a>  think you mean slide seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4325.471s">Slide</a>  seven.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4326.452s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4326.832s">There's</a>  a line about participation that maybe could just be expanded.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4331.836s">Mm</a>  hmm. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4333.017s">I</a>  also like keeping the slide because it just occurred to me maybe if someone sees that, maybe we'll get more people participating in this type of thing in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4340.702s">I</a>  would love to get more feedback on any similar situations we find ourselves in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4348.646s">So</a>  I agree with Melissa that it would be good to keep it there so that people know that their voices are heard.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4354.179s">But</a>  I do think too, I'm sorry to belabor the point, for all those people who voted for the names that aren't the top five, then maybe it should say, these five names had the most feedback or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4367.072s">Because</a>  all the other names that are on the list, people wrote about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4369.894s">And</a>  so for those people, they're not seeing, well, where's the name I voted, submitted on, not voted.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4376.45s">Right,</a>  so do we add saying that there's 500 other votes or however many other votes there were that weren't counted from those other 13 nominees?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4388.312s">Just</a>  point of information, that is why I only wanted the three of our finalists there with a percentage. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4394.073s">So</a>  you can figure out there were other votes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4397.233s">I</a>  just wanna make it simple but concise that this is valuable, we appreciate this input 100%, but it just, it wasn't a vote.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4406.968s">point</a>  of information, Mr. Lister, I don't see why we don't list the names without the submission numbers and or the top 18 that we were discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4417.474s">Here</a>  are the top 18 that we discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4421.036s">Why</a>  do we need the submission numbers? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4423.737s">And,</a>  you know, I feel strongly that we do not put this in as a submission because it does look like votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4430.341s">Some</a>  of our committee members are saying the word vote, and I find it really <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4434.99s">I</a>  don't know, awful to hear that all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4437.231s">So</a>  there's some confusion over submissions and votes.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4445.273s">We're</a>  going to move past this page and we're going to stick on this page for the rest of the night.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4450.234s">Well,</a>  from a point of order, are we actually <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4454.226s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor to accept it into it or not?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4457.971s">It</a>  was a motion on the floor to accept it into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4460.253s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4462.156s">Is</a>  a friendly is a friendly amendment offered that has not been accepted yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4468.123s">That's</a>  our procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4469.584s">Okay,</a>  so to Melissa. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4472.728s">I'm</a>  asking you to accept the amendment that only the three finalist names and the percentage of submissions are listed along with the disclaimer, either in slide seven or slide eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4486.371s">Do</a>  you?</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4487.472s">Ron,</a>  I accept your friendly amendment.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4489.252s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4492.833s">That's</a>  how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4493.593s">That's</a>  our process, been since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4496.654s">All</a>  right, but right now- Now you can vote on it, up or down.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4502.355s">I'm</a>  sorry, I think there was another amendment on the floor from Matt Haverstead. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4504.937s">I'd</a>  like to second that amendment to put the top 18 names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4508.961s">I</a>  think it makes sense that the other names are missing, to put just the 18 names and not the number of submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4515.886s">I</a>  would second that amendment.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4521.491s">Mr.</a>  Chair, I'm against that.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4522.752s">All</a>  right, that wasn't a friendly amendment, the second one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4526.856s">So</a>  we'll vote that amendment first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4530.344s">Is</a>  there any more discussion here?</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4531.725s">Point</a>  of clarification, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4533.287s">Can</a>  I ask Laura what if we're summarizing the community feedback and somebody please explain to me that just listing the 18 names that doesn't really provide any context of why. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4546.212s">I</a>  don't really would see the point of just listing 18 names so if somebody could just keep clarify that for me.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4551.598s">Before</a>  I vote, I can address that I think, as Kathy case that it makes sense that you know we're leaving out in the 1412 names here that people did put a lot of heart and soul into. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4563.45s">And</a>  I think having the numbers of submissions, as I've said before, gives the wrong sense that these have some sort of weight. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4571.376s">Perhaps</a>  there was one submission in a name in the top 18 that really spoke to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4575.72s">We</a>  were not given a quantitative task. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4578.842s">We</a>  were given a qualitative task to use our best judgment to read all of the feedback from everybody and make our decision based on a rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4588.35s">We</a>  were not tasked with counting numbers of submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4591.552s">And</a>  so I have said it, but I will just say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4594.034s">I</a>  think it is misleading to the public to rank by the number of submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4598.497s">And</a>  instead I would like to see the full 18 be there.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4602.0s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4604.402s">It</a>  was then misleading to ask the public to submit information if we were going to not even consider it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4609.946s">So</a>  we can get on to the next slide.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4618.718s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. Chair, the amendment that needs to be voted on is the amendment of the 18 names, not the amendment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4626.345s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4628.087s">Can</a>  I have that vote now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4629.288s">Anybody</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4632.511s">Is</a>  there a second on adding all 18 names? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4635.714s">Three.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4636.314s">And</a>  without the submission number.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4639.769s">How</a>  do you vote on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4641.15s">No,</a>  you're all talking over each other.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4643.212s">I</a>  have no idea what's being voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4645.414s">There's</a>  so many amendments flying around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4647.736s">I've</a>  had my hand up since the start of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4650.618s">I</a>  don't, I don't know what we're voting on.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4654.782s">This</a>  was an amendment to list all 18 names with the submissions next to them.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4661.955s">point</a>  of order, without the submission numbers next to that.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4664.157s">Oh,</a>  without the submission.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4664.937s">That's</a>  how I understood it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4665.798s">With</a>  the submissions, with the submissions was the agreement.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4668.82s">The</a>  amendment from Matt Haberstow, maybe he could clarify.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4672.062s">Yeah,</a>  there was a motion before Matt's.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4675.444s">Yes,</a>  there was a motion before Matt's. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4677.105s">I</a>  simply, you know, somebody can help me with procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4680.528s">I</a>  would just suggesting we list all 18, top 18, without the numbers, because the numbers <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4688.064s">You</a>  know, they make you interpret it as voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4692.026s">And</a>  as Mr. McCabe said, a lot of these submissions weren't verifiable, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4699.188s">So</a>  putting all these numbers up there makes it look like a winner and a loser. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4703.85s">And</a>  we don't wanna do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4704.77s">We</a>  wanna put all 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4705.57s">These</a>  are the ones we discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4707.591s">In</a>  other words, number of submissions provided by the community, 1,200, 1,300. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4710.312s">And</a>  these are the top 13 we discussed.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4715.705s">So</a>  information, Jim runs, runs friendly amendment was percentages, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4721.006s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4721.966s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4722.326s">So</a>  we vote on that.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4723.926s">So</a>  we got to vote first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4725.087s">We</a>  got to vote mats down or up before we get to Ron's.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4730.768s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4731.848s">My</a>  end doesn't need a vote if she, if Melissa accepts it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4734.308s">So</a>  we need to do this one first.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4735.529s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4735.809s">Then</a>  we go right to Melissa. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4738.149s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4739.429s">So</a>  this is to list all 18 with no <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4744.385s">number</a>  of submissions next to them.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4747.187s">But</a>  if clarification, would a yes vote here, then are we going to actually be voting for whether or not we include the slide as a whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4760.478s">So</a>  what happens with a yes vote or with a no vote to this particular amendment?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4769.445s">So</a>  this is to add it to the slide if we include the slide in the next vote.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4775.642s">Thank</a>  you, Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4780.246s">Mr.</a>  Chair, the question, though, is if we include the 18 names, that's the only thing on this slide.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4786.872s">That's</a>  the only thing on the amendment, is do we include the 18 names?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4793.058s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4794.539s">And</a>  if we say we include the 18 names, then the original motion is moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4804.403s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4804.943s">I</a>  mean, there's nothing else on the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4806.604s">If</a>  there were more things on the slide, I would understand.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4810.185s">Wouldn't</a>  the motion be to accept to keep this slide as amended, if that motion passes?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4821.308s">That</a>  was my idea, to keep this slide, but eliminate the numbers and put all 18.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4826.55s">What</a>  if we just reiterate in the introduction, out of the nearly 1,300 <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4833.138s">community</a>  submissions that we received on 18 candidates are the five that went forward, or I don't wanna say, the five that had the highest rubric score were, that way we're giving context, we're giving information, we are acknowledging people that were, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4859.987s">you</a>  know, listed, but not, we can't, don't have room to list everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4863.43s">And</a>  we're just, and then letting the community know there are more names that we don't have room to list here, but we heard you and read every single one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4873.379s">Something</a>  like that.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4873.88s">Point</a>  of information, I don't think the rubric scores accurately represent what was submitted by the community.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4878.644s">Point</a>  of procedure, please, to Patrick through the chair.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4883.969s">Go</a>  ahead, Ron.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4886.21s">Patrick,</a>  if the first amendment, which was mine, is accepted by the author as a friendly amendment, how does it not become the amendment that we vote on for this slide?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4900.18s">Because</a>  the amendment to the friendly amendment is what needs to be voted on first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4906.185s">Any</a>  amendment to a motion needs to be voted on before the motion itself.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4913.69s">It's</a>  an amendment to the motion, right?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4916.734s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4919.095s">So</a>  if the amendment doesn't pass, then we go to Ron, we go to the other.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4923.376s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4923.936s">But</a>  if the amendment does pass, I believe that that means that this slide is 18 names with no submissions.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4934.038s">Point</a>  of information too, once we add this amendment, then you can vote up or down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4938.439s">So</a>  got a lot of work still to go on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4940.62s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4941.88s">Move</a>  the amendment please.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4943.1s">Right</a>  now it's the amendment.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4946.91s">So</a>  right now I am voting on this slide to have 18 names on it with no numbers.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4953.115s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4954.596s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4955.376s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4957.958s">Dan.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4961.14s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4963.982s">Aaron.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4964.343s">Aaron's</a>  not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4965.323s">Beth's</a>  not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4966.224s">Aaron.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4967.165s">Aaron</a>  is here.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4967.805s">Aaron</a>  is here.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4970.027s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4970.727s">Aaron.</a> </p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4973.73s">He's</a>  muted.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=4975.32s">She's</a>  not a host, she can't unmute.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5119.114s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5120.334s">And</a>  now are we leaving the slide in? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5125.156s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5125.936s">That's</a>  the motion we're voting on.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5129.795s">I</a>  believe that's what was just voted on, Mr. Chair.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5132.997s">That</a>  was the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5134.318s">An</a>  amendment to that slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5135.999s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5138.441s">Now,</a>  didn't Ron have an amendment to put it up there with percentages?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5142.163s">My</a>  amendment is moot now because we voted on this amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5145.425s">All</a>  we can do is vote down the slide and vote on a new motion to a new slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5150.949s">That's</a>  our only option.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5152.53s">Thank</a>  you, Ron.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5154.831s">And</a>  may I ask a question to the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5157.593s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5158.539s">I</a>  guess through Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5159.659s">So</a>  for voting on this slide, is it as is or what we just voted on to amend it with?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5164.321s">Well,</a>  I'm certainly not the expert, but it's been amended to just the 18 names here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5169.784s">I</a>  don't know where it's positioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5172.745s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5173.205s">We</a>  just voted to put 18 names on this slide.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5175.766s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5175.986s">So</a>  that's what we're voting on now.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5177.487s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5178.407s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5178.867s">And</a>  Patrick is the expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5180.168s">I'm</a>  just a slide in to leave the slide in that says, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5185.438s">the</a>  all 18 names, no submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5187.979s">I</a>  assume you all mean under where it says number of submissions provided by the community that didn't get changed.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5195.263s">That's</a>  correct, Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5196.464s">That</a>  makes the most sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5197.705s">All</a>  18 names, no submissions under that next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5201.767s">Are</a>  we voting?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5202.868s">My</a>  point is that all we did was, what does the slide look like with this amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5208.911s">Is</a>  the number of submissions provided by the community on the public engagement form, does that stay? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5213.533s">Because</a>  I don't remember voting on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5216.221s">Or</a>  is it just a slide that says the 18 names?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5225.209s">Somebody</a>  can wordsmith that fairly easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5227.931s">That's</a>  on the subcommittee, I would imagine.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5232.035s">Was</a>  it Kristen who was making the changes as we spoke? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5236.018s">Somebody</a>  can just pop in and do that right now, right?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5238.08s">All</a>  right, let's move on the slide up or down.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5242.167s">So</a>  all this discussion could be- We have to vote on the up or down on this slide.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5247.671s">Yeah,</a>  point of order, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5249.452s">I</a>  believe that we just voted on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5251.754s">The</a>  amendment was to replace all of the language that was in the original motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5256.177s">I</a>  mean, we could vote again whether or not we include the slide, but I mean, I think that by virtue of us voting on the slide content, we're voting on having the slide in the presentation.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5275.598s">Point</a>  of information, my understanding was is that we were gonna vote on Matt's and then we were gonna vote on Jim's, I'm sorry, on Ron's that had the percentages, you know, and keep at the bottom three, but now there's not gonna be any percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5295.203s">And</a>  like Ron said, his, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5302.312s">It's</a>  just useless. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5303.173s">It</a>  doesn't make any, what we just did to me makes zero sense because we voted on one thing thinking that there was gonna be another vote on another thing and it never happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5316.54s">So</a>  now we're gonna have a slide with 18 names on it with no percentages. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5321.182s">To</a>  me, that's absolutely useless because it's not showing the true, you know, the true thing that the public was able to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5330.207s">We're</a>  basically leaving that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5332.618s">just</a>  doesn't make sense.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5334.719s">Point</a>  of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5336.479s">Isn't</a>  that information on the slide that comes prior?</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5339.94s">It's</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5340.84s">We</a>  eliminated that slide now, apparently.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5343.641s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5345.181s">Slide</a>  number seven, I mean.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5351.443s">I</a>  guess to Danny's point is, what is the purpose of these 18? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5356.844s">Otherwise,</a>  the previous slide works fine, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5359.973s">We've</a>  already, you know, we keep talking about everything's open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5365.034s">People</a>  know who the 18 are. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5366.175s">I</a>  don't know what the point of this slide would be as a speaker presenting.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5369.256s">The</a>  point now would be whether to keep the slide or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5371.236s">And</a>  I mean, I don't see the way it is now.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5373.297s">Let's</a>  vote it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5375.257s">Let's</a>  vote it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5375.838s">That's</a>  how we do it.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5376.538s">Information</a>  through the chair, Mr. Lister? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5378.638s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5379.519s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5380.059s">This</a>  is Matt Haberstroh, just so you guys know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5382.34s">The</a>  point of this slide <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5385.468s">It's</a>  not to slant the numbers that were thought of as votes, which people on this committee actually refer to as votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5393.092s">So</a>  for the community, which I'm a part of, and I feel strongly about representing all those voices in Medford, that now they can see all 18 of these.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5402.557s">I</a>  hope I'm not being mocked.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5406.097s">I</a>  am just saying that this is the slide that shows you all the information that the community put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5412.501s">And</a>  I see that as not a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5415.262s">I</a>  see it as a focus rather than a rating system. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5418.785s">And</a>  that's the point of it.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5419.965s">Point</a>  of information, Jim, I find that we're not being transparent with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5424.488s">And</a>  I think it's very wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5425.949s">And</a>  it's a disservice to the folks that did submit for any name. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5430.013s">So</a>  I think a discussion needs to be had and something needs to be shown, whether on another slide, with percentages from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5438.441s">We're</a>  always talking about transparency and inclusiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5441.584s">Well,</a>  let's include the folks that took their time to vote for anybody and show some sort of percentage of what folks did vote for.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5449.432s">Well,</a>  that's the point.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5450.133s">There's</a>  a lot of slides to go through here.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5453.038s">But</a>  they weren't voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5453.959s">I</a>  think that's the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5454.78s">I</a>  think that's the point we're trying to make here.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5484.598s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. Lister. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5486.299s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5487.279s">So</a>  this is transparency, Danny. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5489.159s">These</a>  are all the names that the community put feedback in. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5491.7s">This</a>  is transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5493.101s">It</a>  is transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5494.041s">Why</a>  don't we put some numbers next to all those names?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5496.502s">Because</a>  the numbers were never the point of this feedback.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5501.243s">Somebody</a>  went through all the feedback and made some assumptions about ratings and things of that nature, which construes in a wrong way what the community feedback really is.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5518.729s">I</a>  don't feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5520.07s">I</a>  don't feel that way personally.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5527.947s">get</a>  a couple more hands raised and then we can vote this slide in or out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5531.549s">I</a>  mean, hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5539.195s">Maria,</a>  would you like to say something?</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5542.017s">Yes,</a>  we quite literally just took a vote to include the top 18 names without numbers and that was voted yes.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5555.172s">to</a>  vote, put the top 18 in the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5557.514s">Now</a>  let's vote on whether to put the slide or not.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5561.596s">Yes,</a>  and I just don't understand why there's this discussion about something that has already been voted down.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5570.342s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. Chair, if I may answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5573.224s">So</a>  there's an original motion on the floor to have a slide about community and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5579.928s">And</a>  then there was a debate about what that slide should look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5582.569s">So</a>  now the question is, do we include a slide about community feedback, which would be the 18 names with no submissions? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5590.553s">That's</a>  the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5591.233s">That's</a>  why it's two different pieces of a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5598.816s">The</a>  vote right now is whether or not to include this slide that people are looking at right now as part of the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5604.699s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5607.08s">Any</a>  more discussion?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5808.856s">Probably.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5809.316s">I</a>  think if we just specify a little more, we received community submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5820.3s">And</a>  from that, we took 18 names.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5828.363s">And</a>  maybe after reviewing community feedback, all 18 names are individually scored by all committee members.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5845.645s">Do</a>  we have on any of these slides how many submissions we received altogether?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5849.367s">I</a>  believe back there was one that said over 1200 submissions.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5855.29s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5855.57s">I</a>  think you should take a look at slide seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5865.436s">I</a>  think a lot of this is covered in that slide.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5869.178s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5870.83s">All</a>  right, let's, do we need to change anything here or are we all right with this one? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5877.292s">This</a>  is just procedure we went through.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5880.493s">To</a>  Ron's point, can we look at slide seven? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5883.494s">It</a>  seems like there may be a lot of duplication. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5889.575s">No,</a>  I guess not.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5897.437s">I</a>  think this one is how we asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5900.353s">the</a>  public participation and then the next slide is what we, how we parsed it.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5909.357s">I</a>  was just referring to the amount of, I was just referring to the amount of submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5913.879s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5914.959s">Slide</a>  seven says 17 names and then this one says- Oh, good point.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5923.523s">Oh</a>  no, we said 17 plus one name that was accidentally left off.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5926.984s">You're</a>  right, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5933.588s">Is</a>  everybody okay with this slide?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5934.949s">I</a>  think maybe in the first bullet, we could add in something. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5940.771s">A</a>  short-term memory shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5943.533s">Maybe</a>  what Ron had talked about for the last slide, maybe some of his wording could be more clear here or make this more clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5952.397s">Our</a>  community, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5959.681s">I</a>  eliminated the last slide of the, so.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5967.016s">when</a>  we were talking about adding to the community feedback slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5972.621s">Was</a>  there like a sentence that would make this more?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5974.642s">I</a>  burnt it 30 minutes ago.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5982.388s">All</a>  18 names gleaned or synonym for gleaned, gleaned from public participation.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5988.553s">I</a>  would motion that Dr. Grace accept these words as a friendly amendment just to <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=5995.913s">enhance</a>  our appreciation of community involvement?</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6000.137s">I'm</a>  a little, probably yes, but I'm just a little confused about what we're trying to accomplish with the addition because I'm also looking at what was written in the proposed script to try and add context to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6024.023s">So</a>  right now it says the top 18 names were also independently researched and scored via the previously discussed rubric by all 23 advisory committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6033.47s">The</a>  scores were collected, averaged and ranked. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6036.232s">The</a>  committee then moved forward to reduce the list down using the final three adopted process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6043.637s">And</a>  I thought at some point it said, yeah, there's a line in it saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6054.303s">As</a>  a committee, we all took into account our own research, the rubric, and public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6059.846s">So</a>  I don't know if... So I guess clarification to the friendly amendment as to what exactly we're putting in the top with all the 18, and then let's go from there.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6075.697s">Are</a>  you asking me this question?</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6079.5s">Whoever</a>  proposed it, yes.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6085.47s">I</a>  see the value, and based on what Melissa and everybody else has contributed, I do believe it's our opportunity to make a statement of how invaluable the community input was. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6096.955s">And</a>  I think you can do that with two things, straightening out this vote versus submission thing in this sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6106.039s">While</a>  this number, whatever you want to say, while the submissions were not significant in any way as a vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6114.522s">the</a>  total entries received was invaluable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6118.004s">I</a>  don't know, I gotta rewrite it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6121.285s">Was</a>  invaluable to the committee for both positive and negative feedback.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6125.348s">Absolutely,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6127.229s">Thank</a>  you for that clarification.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6128.529s">Thank</a>  you, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6129.83s">How</a>  about did not signify a vote instead of saying we're not significant, because we don't want it to sound demeaning.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6135.293s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah, that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6136.814s">And</a>  I know what you meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6137.654s">I</a>  totally know that you did not mean it in any way.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6139.955s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6141.736s">Do</a>  you wanna?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6142.617s">Can</a>  someone else? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6145.63s">Here,</a>  let me just add it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6147.451s">Say</a>  it again.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6148.111s">You're</a>  going to ask me to say it again.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6150.451s">Sorry,</a>  I thought you were writing it down.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6152.932s">Let's</a>  just say the committee notes that the community input, although not a vote, was invaluable and important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6166.955s">to</a>  this decision process to receive both positive and most positive anecdote, most positive feedback and positive and negative feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6178.944s">It</a>  was invaluable. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6180.305s">Let</a>  me think about it and write it again.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6185.168s">Was</a>  invaluable and important as to both positive and negative feedback.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6190.935s">Yeah,</a>  say the committee wishes, I believe everybody's saying this, the committee wishes to note that the community feedback was an invaluable, it was a very valuable piece of our decision process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6204.843s">The</a>  ability to receive both positive and negative anecdotes and feedback.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6212.208s">It</a>  was an invaluable, important part of our <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6214.776s">Did</a>  you say the word deliberation?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6216.637s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6217.417s">You</a>  can do that.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6219.758s">There's</a>  so many. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6221.979s">English</a>  is not my thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6223.16s">I</a>  can add it up after, but not speaking.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6225.621s">Good,</a>  because someone was saying percentages before, and I was like, do not let me do anywhere near math.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6232.504s">This</a>  is Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6233.125s">I</a>  like the spirit of that, Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6234.705s">I</a>  really do.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6235.586s">I</a>  do too.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6239.062s">This</a>  is Seth, and I like it, except invaluable and important are kind of saying the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6244.965s">Oh,</a>  yeah, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6246.285s">Someone,</a>  synonym, or non-synonym. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6253.188s">Invaluable</a>  and necessary? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6255.529s">Significant.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6256.95s">Significant.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6258.611s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6261.712s">I</a>  like necessary.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6265.914s">Anyone</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6268.115s">I</a>  like necessary.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6277.658s">I</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6281.379s">Yeah,</a>  I think that's what I want to get through, at least personally, that these were so incredibly important. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6287.941s">And</a>  I'm sure all of you, just like me, read every one.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6293.162s">Just</a>  a quick grammar, if we phrase it that way, between was an invaluable, invaluable, or, oh, you're right.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6301.484s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6302.344s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6302.724s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6306.05s">This</a>  also doesn't have the positive and negative.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6310.313s">Well,</a>  I mean, we don't necessarily want to say negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6313.155s">I</a>  don't think we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6314.536s">There</a>  were only a few negative ones that I think someone else categorized before and where, you know, someone said we were mentally ill, but we don't need to go into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6326.985s">I</a>  don't think that was a in good faith submission.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6340.785s">Okay,</a>  everybody fine with this now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6343.567s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6346.089s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6346.329s">And</a>  if I could chair, could I say a moment? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6355.074s">This</a>  is Seth, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6356.936s">I</a>  just wanted to comment that things did get pretty heated the last up or down vote that we did have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6364.521s">And</a>  I just wanted to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6368.25s">This</a>  is the thought that I think everybody brought to it, and we brought it in our different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6375.152s">And</a>  I wanted to make sure that it was acknowledged that we all felt a significant burden to represent the community as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6392.159s">And</a>  I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6394.223s">the</a>  committee as a whole did the due diligence of looking through each and every one of those pieces of community feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6406.45s">And</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6408.771s">I</a>  like this wording. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6410.272s">Thanks</a>  for the help of the committee to find it.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6415.895s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6416.796s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6418.777s">Next</a>  slide.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6419.752s">Ready</a>  to move to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6425.834s">We</a>  say during the first round of voting, Belinda Sutton received 12 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6429.695s">And</a>  the additional votes, I just think when we say additional votes, it sounds like there's extra votes or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6437.458s">If</a>  we said the remaining votes or the other votes went to Jean Barry, additional</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6444.462s">Why</a>  do we have to use the word votes anyways? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6446.884s">Why</a>  can't we just get rid of the 12 votes and just say that the first round of voting, we got Belinda Sutton, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6453.911s">Sutton.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6454.872s">Why</a>  do we have to use the word votes? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6457.555s">Those</a>  are our top three. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6459.076s">We're</a>  gonna give votes to either one of them.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6462.479s">A</a>  point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6464.661s">With</a>  this slide, I edited it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6468.105s">It</a>  wasn't... <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6469.699s">Anyways,</a>  to clarify what we did, just we, in order for transparency, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6476.604s">We</a>  went through the initial round of voting where if the nominee received 12 votes, then that would be the recommendation to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6487.252s">And</a>  we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6489.693s">And</a>  so I think it's notable that Belinda Sutton did receive 12 votes and there were other votes that went to the other two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6496.153s">And</a>  then after all of that, Mr. Donato Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6500.995s">then</a>  made a resolution or an amendment was passed in order to bring all three of those names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6507.056s">So</a>  it was just, I think, a step-by-step of what actually transpired with what we did.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6515.599s">But</a>  I- I think because our process was very, a little confusing in the moment that the wording sounds confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6525.687s">I</a>  forgot that we did it that way, but now that you explained it, now I remember.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6528.83s">Jim,</a>  point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6532.633s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6534.375s">So</a>  we could have a slide that shows that Belinda Sutton received 12 votes from the committee, but we can't have a slide showing that Jean Barry Sutherland got 34% of the total votes from the community.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6549.593s">Yes,</a>  because the committee was voting.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6551.894s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6553.675s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6555.797s">I</a>  think it looks the way it looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6558.879s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6559.499s">That's</a>  all I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6561.38s">It</a>  makes sense one way, but it doesn't make sense the other way.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6565.242s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6566.003s">Now</a>  procedure is it was laid out to us.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6568.584s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6570.245s">It</a>  was laid out to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6571.146s">You're</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6571.526s">Jim</a>  was laid to us this way.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6574.008s">12</a>  years back in 2019.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6577.65s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6578.791s">Point</a>  of order.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6580.264s">All</a>  right, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6584.765s">Like</a>  to say something?</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6587.826s">Just</a>  that those comments were out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6591.487s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6593.748s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6594.508s">I</a>  would be fine with just listing the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6596.869s">I</a>  don't know how anyone else feels about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6599.13s">I</a>  don't want to start another. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6600.15s">I</a>  would second that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6603.831s">I'd</a>  vote for that.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6606.772s">I</a>  think especially just because we know how this <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6609.968s">preceded</a>  and we know understand how the Blinda Sutton received 12 and then there were additional.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6615.232s">It</a>  makes sense to us, but I think- It looks pop heavy.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6622.118s">I</a>  think we understand because we get the, we understand how we voted, but if someone wasn't watching the meeting, I think Paul's suggestion is correct because then it does, it makes it seem like the other people <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6635.881s">Yeah,</a>  if you weren't here to watch the process, it is confusing to someone what not involved reading this.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6643.227s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. Lister. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6645.168s">Yes,</a>  Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6646.109s">Matt</a>  Haverstroh, I have no problem with putting, Blueness Sutton received 12 votes, Gene Berry received, I think, seven, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6652.034s">And</a>  Mr., two.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6654.356s">But</a>  you would have a problem with the community slide.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6656.961s">Danny,</a>  you have to go through the chair.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6659.085s">Yeah,</a>  I'll go through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6660.507s">So</a>  Jim, he's saying that he would have no problem with that, but he would have it on the community slide.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6667.617s">Listen,</a>  we have a motion.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6669.857s">We</a>  have a motion and a second here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6671.658s">So</a>  I'm sorry, we have a motion and a second to remove the numbers.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6675.619s">Just</a>  on the motion, if I could, the fact is there were no second votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6680.86s">We</a>  voted for the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6682.74s">So</a>  you can't say one got 12 and maybe somebody else would have gotten 12 and we don't identify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6688.521s">So</a>  with that regard, I think the votes total should be removed.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6693.631s">We</a>  have a motion already to remove the votes, the number of votes, and just tell the people that we accepted the three.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6701.473s">On</a>  the motion, I believe that it is significant to note that Belinda Sutton did receive 12 votes during the first round of voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6714.177s">And</a>  I understand that it may <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6717.886s">be</a>  confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6719.549s">However,</a>  I also think that if someone is watching this presentation and they're really confused as to what exactly that means, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6730.381s">they</a>  are able to go back and watch our previous meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6736.165s">I</a>  feel as though in many of our discussions about confusion, these are things that can easily be clarified if someone is that infested by looking back in our records. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6747.914s">I</a>  think that for <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6750.036s">many</a>  of these committee members who have been repeatedly mentioning transparency, transparency, I think that we should explain this process for the sake of transparency and making very clear what our original process was and what actually transpired through the amended process.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6772.542s">Point</a>  of clarification through the chair, you can't be transparent on one slide and then not be transparent on another. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6778.744s">You're</a>  either transparent 100% of the time, or you're not transparent at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6782.946s">And</a>  I second Ron's comment that Jean did not get any votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6787.067s">She</a>  could have gotten 12 votes the second time around. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6789.888s">So</a>  I think this is extremely misleading to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6792.589s">We're</a>  either gonna be transparent for community feedback, as well as committee input, or we're not gonna be transparent at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6800.868s">My</a>  vote is that we are transparent, that we summarize the voices heard from the community and how we got to this voting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6807.412s">We</a>  can't pick and choose where we're transparent.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6811.915s">For</a>  the chair, I agree.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6813.596s">Lee,</a>  do you have your hand up?</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6816.618s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6817.199s">I</a>  am fine with leaving the 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6820.101s">As</a>  Maria said, I think it does highlight that we use the procedure in the first round. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6827.626s">I</a>  am open to removing that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6830.138s">But</a>  my main comment was going to be, if we leave the 12, we could note here that only three names received any votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6838.065s">So</a>  during the first round of voting, Belinda Sutton received 12 votes, and only three names received any votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6845.391s">So</a>  there were only two other names that received votes.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6850.375s">All</a>  right, so that would be an amendment then, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6852.296s">I</a>  suppose it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6855.719s">Well,</a>  is that a friendly amendment?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6859.6s">What</a>  about something like Belinda Sutton received 12 votes, and then the committee decided to send through the top three candidates, which included Gene Barry, Sutherland, and Misatoch?</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6873.911s">Point</a>  of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6876.173s">So</a>  when we chose to make that amendment, we actually moved from the process that <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6888.007s">Patrick</a>  had written out, which assured that the committee would bring forward the slate of three names that the majority felt were the best names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6908.278s">What</a>  we did by moving the amendment was bring forward <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6915.192s">the</a>  three names that the members of the committee had as their favorite names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6924.88s">And</a>  that's a significant difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6928.043s">The</a>  motion did pass with a two thirds majority that the slate that we are passing to the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6942.713s">Two</a>  thirds of this committee did find that that slate was the best slate, but it is a specific difference that we didn't have a majority vote on the best slate. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6964.85s">And</a>  that's what we would have gotten if we had gone through with Patrick's <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6972.335s">motion,</a>  we had one round, and Belinda Sutton was the only name that received enough votes to be put on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=6987.804s">Since</a>  there were groups of two other committee or groups of people <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7005.42s">two</a>  names then became part of the slate that we are now sending. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7015.344s">And</a>  I think that the way in which this is worded now is probably, it doesn't get into all of that detail, but it is an accurate representation of <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7032.016s">I</a>  think if we start slicing and dicing, then we're going to need to, again, in the interest of full transparency, be a little bit more explicit about how exactly we came to pass the slate.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7054.108s">Thank</a>  you, Laura, would you like to speak.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7056.629s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7057.53s">Um,</a>  so, I, I think this the way it's written now is the most transparent it doesn't omit any of the steps that we took what we had was essentially ranked ranked choice voting right and that can be a little difficult to explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7071.196s">But</a>  in ranked choice voting, you put your top name first. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7074.519s">And</a>  that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7075.68s">And</a>  I think it just might be interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7077.042s">It</a>  might be relevant to the school committee that we did have a first round where Belinda Sutton got 12 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7086.35s">And</a>  as it became obvious after everyone was doing their three minute speech and the way to vote in the first round, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7095.599s">shook</a>  out, it became obvious that the other two were likely to win the second and third rounds, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7100.762s">So</a>  that's why there was a motion to forego the second and third rounds and just to put forth those three names. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7107.466s">I</a>  think it's important to show that and I think it is not transparent to skip an important step that we went through with several votes to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7117.711s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7119.352s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7120.353s">Ron,</a>  did I see your hand up, Ron?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7127.848s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not in favor of listing the number. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7131.211s">I</a>  think you've got to go back and look at who got the highest rubric score too, and we're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7135.594s">So</a>  I'm for just eliminating all the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7137.876s">It's</a>  just too confusing.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7139.978s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7141.439s">Grace,</a>  did you have your hand up?</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7144.321s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7144.501s">I</a>  have an edit I would like to bring forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7150.973s">Changing</a>  that bullet point of during the first round of voting, blah, blah, blah. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7155.235s">So</a>  changing that bullet point to each committee member voted for one nominee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7160.918s">After</a>  the first round of votes was recorded, only three candidates had received a first vote and a motion to amend was made and accepted to offer all three names to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7175.426s">I</a>  agree with you, Grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7176.666s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7177.447s">I'd</a>  second that.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7183.103s">Everybody</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7185.064s">Yeah,</a>  that sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7186.504s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7187.084s">I</a>  think that's nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7188.664s">Can</a>  she say it again so I can type it?</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7193.025s">Very</a>  well said.</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7195.166s">Thank</a>  you, Grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7196.406s">I</a>  think it also replaces the next bullet down so that you have space.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7200.627s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7202.007s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7205.688s">Do</a>  I still have hands up?</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7207.649s">Do</a>  you mind repeating that for her so she can write it?</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7213.727s">Um,</a>  I have it written down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7215.107s">So</a>  how about I just, can I just drop it in? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7218.569s">Yeah,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7219.889s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7221.349s">I</a>  like the idea of it being comprehensible to someone who is only seeing this and who didn't really watch our, our, our YouTube videos that we're currently starring in.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7231.472s">Patrick,</a>  give me a hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7239.255s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7240.015s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7240.975s">Thank</a>  you, Grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7241.776s">You</a>  got hands down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7243.813s">So</a>  we all in agreement here? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7245.494s">I</a>  like doing a couple more hands, hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7248.877s">Lisa,</a>  raise your hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7251.099s">I</a>  think your hand's just stuck up, right?</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7254.682s">Yeah,</a>  my hand's not up, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7256.583s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7262.548s">This</a>  is Seth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7263.289s">I</a>  copied from the transcript Grace's remarks.</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7272.276s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7274.451s">the</a>  chat.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7278.074s">If</a>  I may say, I certainly understand that this is more comprehensible. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7288.321s">I</a>  do think that it is notable to state that Belinda Sutton was the only candidate that did receive 12 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7302.911s">If</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7304.188s">it</a>  would be acceptable to add in that Belinda Sutton got 12 votes or?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7315.61s">I</a>  think it's notable, but then it makes it, for someone who didn't understand that we then voted and changed the procedure halfway through, it just sounds a little like, oh, but these people didn't get 12 votes, that Jean Barry Sutherland and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7328.852s">Suttuck</a>  didn't, and they very well may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7331.373s">I</a>  just feel like it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7336.45s">I</a>  can't think of the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7338.432s">It's</a>  a little misleading, not because we're being misleading, just because we, we changed our procedure halfway through for a good reason and for expediency. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7347.479s">But</a>  I think it would just be a little, people would infer something from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7353.143s">That's</a>  not really there.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7353.924s">Hey,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7356.846s">It's</a>  my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7358.808s">Ryan,</a>  did you have your hand up again? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7363.071s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7363.832s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7365.742s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7366.443s">We</a>  all agree on this page. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7368.265s">We</a>  can move to the next one.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7370.327s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Chairman.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7372.57s">Patrick</a>  does have his hand up.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7374.992s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7375.733s">Patrick.</a> </p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7378.216s">Yeah,</a>  I just, I just want to explain to folks the reason why the 12 is really significant is the initial charge from the school committee was that <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7388.532s">nominees</a>  that we bring forward must receive a majority vote and you know to what Seth had said before Belinda Sutton received you know the 12 votes and then we took a vote of two-thirds to send it send the other two names forward so those other two names you know did receive a majority vote <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7411.382s">not</a>  through the traditional way of the 12 votes that Belinda Sutton received, but it was a compromise vote going forward.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7421.99s">What</a>  about instead of first place vote in the last bullet point, we say majority vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7427.694s">Because</a>  all three did receive a majority vote.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7431.997s">I</a>  think that that is- Point of information, Jim? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7436.06s">Go</a>  ahead, Dan. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7437.401s">Had</a>  we gone with the original format, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7440.805s">Mr.</a>  Tuck could have gotten 15 votes in the next round. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7444.227s">So,</a>  I mean, I think to add, put numbers in it makes zero sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7449.891s">Then</a>  in the next round, maybe Gene Barry gets 15 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7453.533s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7454.073s">That</a>  was just the first round. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7455.134s">The</a>  only reason why we moved it was because all of us only voted on three. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7459.777s">So</a>  we collectively decided to move them forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7463.459s">So</a>  to put a number in this slide, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7468.182s">It's</a>  not being transparent, in my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7471.363s">That's</a>  what this language is here for, that we have right now in front of us.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7474.744s">I</a>  wasn't advocating to have the number put in, Danny, so.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7478.104s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7478.604s">We</a>  agree on this slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7479.725s">Move</a>  to the next one.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7483.286s">I</a>  would like to say that the language of first place vote is a little confusing to me, because that implies as though, at least in my mind, as though <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7498.373s">three</a>  names all had a tie for first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7503.514s">I</a>  just think that the phrasing of first place vote is confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7507.275s">I</a>  also would like to advocate for perhaps putting all three numbers because I think that it is significant. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7520.418s">Once</a>  again, I'll reiterate that Belinda Sutton got 12 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7525.599s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7527.332s">Because</a>  there are 22 members of the committee, it becomes clear that those are the three names that received any votes at all, which is why the motion was made to amend and all three names were offered to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7552.592s">I</a>  make a motion to move on to the next slide.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7557.145s">How</a>  many want to second that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7558.585s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7559.846s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7562.646s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7563.946s">Any</a>  opposed.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7566.327s">I'm</a>  opposed.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7568.907s">I'm</a>  opposed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7571.468s">This</a>  is to accept this slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7576.249s">Move</a>  on to the next one. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7577.469s">Three</a>  brothers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7578.209s">Yes</a>  or no.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7579.429s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7580.029s">This,</a>  this, this feels like a very clear attempt to, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7584.57s">brush</a>  off the comments of some committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7590.815s">Also,</a>  Seth has his hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7592.677s">I</a>  believe he had comments to make.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7595.819s">Seth,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7599.402s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7599.823s">Am</a>  I now commenting on the motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7603.286s">For</a>  Christ's sake.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7605.007s">The</a>  slide, so.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7606.428s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7608.55s">Lou,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7609.251s">Was</a>  that directed to me or is the chair? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7610.772s">Oh,</a>  I was talking to someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7611.573s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7615.136s">I'm</a>  sorry, I pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7623.48s">A</a>  motion's on the floor to accept the slide and it was seconded.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7627.142s">Anybody</a>  else's hand up? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7628.062s">I'm</a>  sorry, I closed out that window and I can't get it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7631.024s">Patrick's</a>  hand is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7632.785s">Patrick.</a> </p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7634.205s">No,</a>  I gotta take it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7636.947s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7637.867s">Could</a>  we, I know there's procedure, but if the issue is first place vote, could we maybe just <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7644.452s">agree</a>  on a wording for that, and then?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7646.155s">It</a>  would just be received a vote.</p>

    <p>[Mallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7654.026s">Yeah,</a>  I would say received a vote.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7656.185s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. Lister, reporting information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7658.866s">I</a>  kind of agree with Maria Roach. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7661.326s">This</a>  is Matt Haberstroh. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7663.426s">It</a>  just sounds like all three of these people got first place votes and there was a tie at the finish line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7669.508s">That's</a>  clearly not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7673.568s">Linda</a>  Sutton got 12, which is kind of blows away everyone else, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7678.049s">So</a>  there should be some reference to that in this last one.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7681.55s">Sure,</a>  and Gene Barry Sutherland got 423 submissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7685.373s">You</a>  want to get rid of that, but you don't want to get rid of this.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7687.914s">Please,</a>  please, please, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7690.696s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Lister. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7692.137s">We</a>  have a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7694.078s">Matt,</a>  you would just vote down then. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7695.679s">You</a>  don't want this slide, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7697.4s">I</a>  mean, we're going to vote the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7700.222s">You</a>  vote it down if you want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7701.963s">You</a>  don't like the language, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7703.864s">I</a>  thought we were talking about the language in the slide.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7706.678s">Well,</a>  I'm happy to remove first place vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7713.42s">That</a>  helps.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7716.001s">It</a>  does help. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7716.581s">Thank</a>  you, Grace.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7720.903s">Can</a>  we change it to first round vote?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7725.385s">Well,</a>  it says the first round here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7726.765s">After</a>  the first round of votes, only three candidates have received and it says a first place vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7733.805s">So</a>  I think Grace's idea of just eliminating that, can also receive a vote.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7738.166s">Majority</a>  vote?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7741.526s">No,</a>  because some didn't have a majority, so.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7744.747s">Well,</a>  it was the only, just a vote.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7747.688s">Right,</a>  because we, okay.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7750.888s">And</a>  a motion was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7751.768s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7754.569s">We</a>  move this now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7755.849s">I</a>  will drop my motion if we just move on to the next slide.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7762.382s">I</a>  think this conveys to the general public, the basics of how we proceeded.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7768.324s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7769.164s">We're</a>  all in agreement on this slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7770.704s">We</a>  can move to the next one.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7773.245s">There's</a>  some hands up.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7776.406s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7777.906s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7779.947s">Maria,</a>  your hand up.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7782.688s">I</a>  still believe that we should include the numbers, quite frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7787.829s">Um,</a>  I, I, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7791.17s">really</a>  see how it would be so confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7794.731s">I</a>  think that the language, if we were simply to add after received a vote, may I edit the slideshow just to explain my point? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7810.178s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7814.399s">I</a>  can remove it after, but Belinda Sutton received 12 votes <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7821.966s">Um,</a>  Jean Barry Sutherland received seven votes and miss a tuck received two votes and a motion to amend was made and accepted to offer all three names to the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7841.458s">I</a>  don't believe that that is too confusing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7846.201s">I</a>  may I make a motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7850.033s">add</a>  that to the presentation?</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7852.374s">No,</a>  my motion's still on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7855.496s">Jim,</a>  may I make a suggestion through the chair to Maria?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7859.817s">Point</a>  of order, that would be a motion to amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7862.899s">That</a>  would be a motion to amend. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7864.44s">Yes,</a>  Kathy, please.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7866.1s">If</a>  we just put in the word only, after the first round of votes was recorded, only three candidates received, oh, sorry, it's already, only three candidates received a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7876.985s">Sorry,</a>  it was already there, I missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7880.105s">I</a>  retract.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7883.167s">Motion</a>  to move to the next slide, Mr. Chairman.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7887.35s">We</a>  have an amendment to your motion, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7891.893s">She</a>  wants to put it back to putting, I mean.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7898.237s">Point</a>  of order, it wasn't actually to Paul's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7902.04s">It</a>  was a new motion in and of itself, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7906.242s">Well,</a>  that would be an amendment with a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7909.072s">Either</a>  that or we vote the other motion up or down.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7913.755s">Didn't</a>  Paul just say he would withdraw his motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7916.757s">Did</a>  I hear that?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7918.638s">With</a>  a condition, he said it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7920.68s">Yes,</a>  if we moved on to the next slide, leave it the way it is right now currently and move on to the next slide.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7926.864s">Well,</a>  could I offer my motion as instead an amendment to add that to the slide, then move on to the next slide?</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7940.577s">And</a>  then I'll add an amendment to add that there's 423 votes were made for submissions were made for Jean Barry Sutherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7948.041s">I</a>  mean, we can go on.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7948.922s">We</a>  already voted that down.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7950.342s">I</a>  understand that, so that's why I'm saying.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7953.824s">But</a>  we have not voted on whether or not to.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7955.545s">You're</a>  not going to be able to be presenters to the school committee next Tuesday.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7959.127s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7960.148s">No,</a>  I come back and forth, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7963.25s">Point</a>  of information, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7965.471s">Can</a>  we all start looking at the presentation and realizing what we're doing here? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7970.035s">If</a>  you think putting votes there is going to influence seven school committee people, as opposed to the description of the candidates, then there's something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7978.899s">I</a>  vote as is, move the question, but we can vote on the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7983.302s">But,</a>  you know, this stuff is getting, you know, we're in our 90 minutes in where we've got another six hours to go with the way we're moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7991.045s">So</a>  if you want to put the amendment up, let's vote it up and down.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=7996.878s">And</a>  my point of information is, gentlemen, simply that the way it's worded now, it does not highlight that Belinda Sutton received the majority of votes from our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8008.084s">The</a>  public input was not a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8010.486s">Our</a>  committee does vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8012.327s">Belinda</a>  Sutton did receive the most votes, all 12 from our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8019.27s">If</a>  we have it like this and do not acknowledge that she received the majority of votes, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8024.905s">Even</a>  if we don't put in a number, we have not indicated that she received the majority of votes among the names that we put forward.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8032.549s">Point</a>  of information, please.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8033.729s">That's</a>  my information point.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8036.671s">Lee,</a>  I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8038.292s">All</a>  I'm saying is, as being part of the presentation group, all I kept hearing was, let's be neutral, let's be fair, and let's not enhance one or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8047.776s">I</a>  think without knowing the procedure that we went through, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8051.862s">I</a>  just, I think this accomplishes the same goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8054.523s">There's</a>  plenty of time to celebrate in a different way. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8058.025s">This</a>  to me is just not significant in terms of the vote, and it would move the question, and that's all I'm looking to do now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8064.067s">I</a>  just don't think it's a significant piece to stand on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8066.729s">You</a>  may disagree, in which case, let's vote.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8070.49s">I</a>  agree, I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8072.051s">Thank</a>  you, Ron. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8074.112s">Wouldn't</a>  it still be in the script that she had 12 votes? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8079.172s">Not</a>  in these bullet points.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8082.194s">No,</a>  not if we vote on this slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8085.197s">The</a>  presenters will have to stick to this script that we write, not going offline.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8091.101s">Yeah,</a>  no, the script should reflect the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8093.964s">So</a>  there will have to be edits made to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8098.187s">But</a>  I think what we say should reflect what's also on the slide.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8104.537s">Point</a>  of information, I have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8106.699s">This</a>  was supposed to end at six just for my own personal planning purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8110.683s">Are</a>  we going to extend this until we're done?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8113.305s">Just</a>  got a message. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8114.186s">We</a>  have to be off by seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8115.908s">Before</a>  seven.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8118.53s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8119.771s">Sorry</a>  to interrupt.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8121.273s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8121.873s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8123.054s">Can</a>  I can I make a friendly amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8125.076s">I</a>  think if that's what it'd be called.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8128.364s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8129.244s">So</a>  could we say only three vote, only three candidates, and then right after the word candidates, put parentheses Sutton 12 or Barry seven, miss a top two. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8140.587s">And</a>  then there it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8141.987s">The</a>  information's in there.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8149.109s">I</a>  second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8149.949s">I</a>  think that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8151.77s">I</a>  mean, that's a friendly amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8153.75s">Who's</a>  the motion to accept that amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8157.531s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8159.097s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8162.118s">Don't</a>  we have something on the floor that Paul put up?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8166.598s">Point</a>  of clarification, what is the motion that's on the floor right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8171.559s">The</a>  motion is to keep the slide the way it is and move to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8175.8s">But</a>  the slide has changed five times since there was a motion to keep the slide the way it is.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8181.421s">Keep</a>  the slide the way it is presently, because I'm the one that made the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8185.202s">Keep</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8186.102s">Keep</a>  the slide the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8188.182s">Right</a>  now, move on to the next slide as we were just informed that there's another meeting coming up and we'll never finish this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8195.669s">As</a>  Ron said, we have five, six hours more left to work to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8199.152s">We're</a>  gonna have to go to the school committee and ask for another week to delay this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8203.075s">So</a>  let's just move on to the next slide, please.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8207.639s">Who</a>  seconded that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8208.92s">I</a>  second it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8214.803s">And</a>  then there's a friendly amendment on the, it seems like, or not a friendly amendment, but there's, I don't know if Maria has an amendment or if Principal K has an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8225.412s">I</a>  don't, I think they both have amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8227.754s">I</a>  think they say the same thing, but we need to clarify what the amendment is.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8232.518s">Point</a>  of information, I've been trying to keep score, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8236.441s">Dr.</a>  Grace made a friendly amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8239.244s">Now</a>  we're debating, there is no amendment on the floor that's been seconded.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8244.601s">I</a>  made an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8247.102s">Maria</a>  Rota made an amendment.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8249.744s">Has</a>  it not been seconded yet?</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8251.685s">I</a>  second it.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8254.366s">Let's</a>  vote on it.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8257.788s">Can</a>  you say what the amendment is so that we know what we're talking about?</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8262.786s">The</a>  amendment is to insert after had received a vote, dash, Belinda Sutton received 12 votes, comma, Jean Barry Sutherland received seven votes, comma, and Missituk received two votes, dash. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8281.915s">And</a>  a motion to amend was made and accepted to offer all three names to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8287.758s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8292.428s">on</a>  the amendment, Bree?</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8600.302s">point</a>  of information when I was editing the slides and we initially put the three names in alphabetical order, I suggested or requested that these overview slides also be put in that same order. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8611.81s">Mr.</a>  Tuck, Jean Barry Sutherland and Belinda Sutton to keep things in alphabetical order so there could be no indication that we are giving any preference.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8622.817s">That</a>  makes sense.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8623.818s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8625.974s">make</a>  sense to me too.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8626.634s">All</a>  right, let's do the content in the way it is now and then we'll just, we'll flip it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8630.176s">Yes,</a>  I figured that's something we can do offline. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8631.997s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8632.437s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8636.579s">Okay,</a>  does anybody have a problem?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8639.06s">I</a>  like the content of this one.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8641.701s">I</a>  think it's great.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8643.682s">Very</a>  nice.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8644.546s">Motion</a>  to accept this slide.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8646.407s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8647.628s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8649.129s">There's</a>  a typo down below. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8650.609s">It</a>  opens a rare opportunity, a rare window onto the life. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8657.293s">So</a>  all the way to the left, three lines or two lines up from the bottom should say into the life.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8662.877s">Oh,</a>  was this a quote? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8665.558s">We'd</a>  have to see if someone, it was just pasted directly from.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8668.38s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8670.861s">We'd</a>  have to check on it.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8672.282s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8674.833s">I'll</a>  check now.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8676.057s">OK,</a>  I'll make a little comment here.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8704.493s">PB,</a>  Harmon Zuckerman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8705.514s">PB,</a>  David Ensign — Herndon, he's on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8707.034s">PB,</a>  Harmon Zuckerman. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8707.855s">PB,</a>  David Ensign — Herndon, he's on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8712.237s">PB,</a>  Harmon Zuckerman.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8730.875s">Oh,</a>  it is.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8731.936s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8732.216s">Point</a>  of clarification, do they only hear her story when they visit? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8737.079s">I've</a>  never been, so I just want to know, do they only hear Belinda's story, or do they hear the whole history of the royal house?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8743.103s">The</a>  whole... Lee could probably answer that one.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8746.832s">Yeah,</a>  I assume they hear the whole history of the Royal House, but of the enslaved people, Belinda is the main story that they would hear about.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8754.916s">So</a>  we should say that the students attend the Royal House as a field trip and hear the story of the history, including her story. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8761.138s">I</a>  don't think we just highlight her on the visit.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8763.62s">Can</a>  I move to the... Oh, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8766.521s">Is</a>  this on the next slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8767.581s">Should</a>  I move to the next slide?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8768.502s">Are</a>  there a couple of slides? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8770.242s">I'm</a>  sorry, this isn't... Yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8772.043s">Okay,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8773.164s">There's</a>  several for each person, each candidate.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8775.805s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8777.625s">Also,</a>  I believe that on the slides themselves, it's clarified that Belinda Sutton is the story which the most is known about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8786.989s">I</a>  don't believe it's said that they only hear about her story.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8791.991s">Can</a>  we- Point of clarification, I don't think you visit the Belinda Sutton house, the royal house to hear about Belinda Sutton. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8797.754s">I</a>  think you learn about the history of everything that went on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8801.816s">And</a>  if we wanna highlight that her story is spoken about because it's the most, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8805.699s">that</a>  we have information on, that's fine, but it's not the Belinda Sutton House. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8809.581s">I</a>  think this is- We wanna honor Belinda Sutton, and we wanna call the dream space over there, the Belinda Sutton House, that could be a discussion for another day.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8817.185s">Point</a>  of order, that is on a later slide, so we can discuss this once we've moved on.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8823.989s">Maria,</a>  can you please learn some respect, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8825.91s">Please,</a>  please, talk to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8828.912s">Hi,</a>  Jim, through the chair, I don't think it's fair to say that you go there to hear Belinda's story. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8834.859s">I</a>  think you go there to hear the story about the history of what happened in that house. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8839.042s">And</a>  Belinda Sutton is a piece of that history. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8843.145s">Point</a>  of order.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8845.127s">That</a>  is on a later slide.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8846.668s">Can</a>  we slide down? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8848.109s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8848.329s">Are</a>  we done with this slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8849.811s">Can</a>  we move to the next slide?</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8851.892s">Kristen,</a>  you can remove your note. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8853.593s">It</a>  does say, um, on to you.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8856.576s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8857.436s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8857.757s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8859.378s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8860.419s">Thanks</a>  Jim.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8861.5s">Jim.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8863.884s">The</a>  Underground Railroad, there's lots of things that you learn about at the Royal House.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8868.788s">I</a>  had tickets before COVID started, and I was very disappointed that I haven't been able to go yet.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8876.013s">I</a>  would love to take you on a tour.</p>

    <p>[Mackenzie]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8877.875s">This</a>  is Janelle. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8878.956s">I've</a>  actually been on the tour with the fifth graders before.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8881.598s">Oh,</a>  how is it?</p>

    <p>[Mackenzie]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8882.999s">It</a>  is not the focus solely on her, but she is mentioned in the tour.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8887.242s">And</a>  do the kids always enjoy it?</p>

    <p>[Mackenzie]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8889.404s">Yes,</a>  it's a great tour.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8890.585s">That</a>  sounds nice.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8891.645s">All</a>  right, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8892.886s">OK,</a>  so next slide.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8894.053s">Next</a>  slide.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8895.114s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8896.494s">So</a>  let's see if it's worded here.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8898.316s">Buddy,</a>  you're not gonna have as much time as you think, so you might want to be less is more if I can get that across to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8908.301s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8908.682s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8909.522s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8916.146s">I</a>  think this one's pretty straightforward in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8918.307s">Anybody</a>  else?</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8924.542s">I</a>  don't like the last line in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8927.303s">I</a>  find it offensive.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8933.666s">I</a>  second.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8936.667s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8941.349s">I</a>  think the Columbus issue is over. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8944.651s">I</a>  do think we should change Columbus with early settlers.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8953.034s">Legacy</a>  of the slave trade?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8956.038s">Excuse</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8957.258s">I</a>  mean, early settlers. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8958.479s">I</a>  mean, we've done the argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8960.159s">That's</a>  not our piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8962.339s">I</a>  think Columbus is just not an appropriate place to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8965.68s">Early</a>  settlers seems to cover everybody.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8969.581s">I</a>  second Ron's wording.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8972.601s">I</a>  accept that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8973.742s">I</a>  would second that too.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8976.282s">Anybody</a>  else got their hand up here? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8977.723s">I</a>  don't see.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8978.263s">I</a>  would like to leave Columbus out of this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8983.204s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8985.269s">No,</a>  I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8985.85s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8986.151s">I</a>  don't see any hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8987.033s">I</a>  think we're good with this.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8988.515s">That's</a>  a friendly amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8992.603s">I</a>  second Ron's amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8994.968s">My</a>  question.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8996.13s">Go</a>  ahead, Seth. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=8999.893s">Well,</a>  excuse me, while you're talking, can someone take out Columbus there and change the language?</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9004.438s">Well,</a>  that was specifically what I was speaking to.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9006.76s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9007.361s">So</a>  the committee in and of itself was specifically formed because we are addressing the marginalization of <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9022.137s">of</a>  Columbus's legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9023.958s">This</a>  is, it's not up to- It's specifically- Point of information.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9031.903s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9037.107s">To</a>  think that putting Columbus's name in here is any way a building tool for the city, is a Columbus or early settlers <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9047.855s">I'm</a>  sure he didn't marginalize all by himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9049.976s">I</a>  would respectfully request that we do not begin the debate again that's been over a year ago settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9058.079s">Early</a>  settlers covers the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9061.88s">Whoever</a>  wrote this, who's the writer of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9067.382s">I'll</a>  offer it as a friendly amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9068.822s">Otherwise</a>  we'll take another vote.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9074.864s">I</a>  agree with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9077.403s">I</a>  have my hand up, Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9078.824s">Go</a>  ahead, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9080.886s">So</a>  I can definitely understand saying the legacy of Columbus as far as Columbus specifically, sort of doing like an end zone dance for some people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9091.877s">I</a>  can have respect for folks that don't want to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9096.921s">But</a>  I think that early settlers is way too <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9101.134s">squishy.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9101.894s">I</a>  don't think that, you know, it acknowledges those marginalized by the slave trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9106.215s">Someone</a>  else offered that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9108.336s">I</a>  mean, I think we need to acknowledge, you know, why people were marginalized and what she overcame.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9114.837s">And</a>  so just saying, instead of early settlers in Columbus then.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9120.518s">For</a>  this entire slide, I did not write this entire slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9123.719s">I</a>  did write this last line. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9125.939s">So</a>  any friendly amendments should maybe be directed towards me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9128.88s">This</a>  is Brie.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9131.69s">Yeah,</a>  so Bree, would you accept acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of the slave trade?</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9136.551s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9137.511s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Genia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9140.492s">You</a>  could say acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of colonization and slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9149.514s">That</a>  works.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9154.515s">That</a>  works. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9157.928s">Jim,</a>  does Bree want to speak to why she chose Columbus?</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9164.556s">Because</a>  we're renaming the Columbus Elementary School based on what we now know about him.</p>

    <p>[Puccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9174.887s">For</a>  clarification, the school committee's renaming the school would just suggest in three possible choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9181.128s">And</a>  I, as I said before, I'm against any mention of Columbus in our presentation to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9190.23s">When</a>  a clarification can breathe, please explain to me the connection between Columbus and Belinda Sutton, or maybe not specifically me, but for those listening, how Belinda Sutton was marginalized by Columbus, please.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9205.485s">uh</a>  sure it's um Columbus and his legacy is one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9212.457s">it</a>  essentially makes him one of the founding fathers of modern slavery, whereas Columbus, you know, marginalized Native Americans who were here first, those same ideals and those practices of like, you know, pushing people off of their land and basically taking them in as slaves, both for labor and for sex trade, that continued well on into modern slavery where, you know, Black people were brought over from Africa. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9240.072s">It</a>  is more of a, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9242.484s">a</a>  chain of events, you could say.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9244.446s">Point</a>  of clarification, Brie, are you saying that Columbus is the name of what you're speaking of? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9255.354s">Totally</a>  disagree.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9257.536s">I'm</a>  sorry, what?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9259.537s">You're</a>  using the name Columbus as if it was, you know, all... I just don't understand why you need to put that in other than to inflame the fans who are watching this show. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9271.07s">Anyways,</a>  let's move the question.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9274.758s">What's</a>  the question again?</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9278.908s">to</a>  remove that line.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9280.069s">Well,</a>  it wasn't accepted as a friendly amendment, so we need to put it as an amendment, whatever the words were.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9285.532s">What</a>  were your words again, Ron, please?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9287.573s">Oh,</a>  these weren't my words.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9289.334s">No,</a>  but not your words. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9290.695s">I'm</a>  talking about the way you said a legacy of.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9293.717s">Well,</a>  they changed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9295.538s">I</a>  don't know who was the one who changed it, but let's vote on that.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9298.46s">Well,</a>  I got a few more hands here. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9300.06s">Grace,</a>  would you like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9301.641s">Yeah,</a>  so I think yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9308.306s">the</a>  actions of Columbus did help move and instill practices that were used in the actual slavery within our lands on the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9326.074s">However,</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9334.765s">Columbus</a>  never landed in the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9338.207s">and</a>  much less was here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9342.229s">And</a>  so I guess I will put forth a friendly amendment to change it to acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of European settlers or colonists. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9355.915s">Just</a>  because I think that holds a little bit more true to where we are <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9362.148s">located</a>  and where the school is and where our city's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9367.331s">So</a>  that's all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9370.734s">Sure</a>  that's that's fine but didn't Aaron also put a put forth a a friendly amendment so now there are two.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9383.522s">You</a>  didn't accept the other friendly amendment so that would have been a</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9386.945s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9387.385s">That</a>  wasn't Aaron's amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9389.827s">Aaron's</a>  was legacy of colonization and slavery.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9393.11s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9393.67s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9394.451s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9394.651s">The</a>  other one was, I think early. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9397.213s">I</a>  don't remember what it was now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9398.674s">Early</a>  settlers, maybe.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9400.856s">So</a>  do you accept any of those as friendly?</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9403.578s">I</a>  would accept Aaron's or braces.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9406.84s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9407.761s">Um,</a>  we have slavery in the previous bullet point. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9412.004s">So</a>  maybe colonization. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9413.86s">European</a>  colonization would be less repetitive?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9416.242s">Settlers?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9420.425s">Legacy</a>  of early European settlers?</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9423.107s">No,</a>  that's the colonization.</p>

    <p>[LaFleur]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9425.71s">Yeah,</a>  I like colonization.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9428.712s">Yeah,</a>  slavery and colonization, colonization, I don't have a strong preference.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9437.739s">Can</a>  we get that changed?</p>

    <p>[Genia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9445.886s">Does</a>  that work?</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9454.09s">Sure,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9454.411s">Mr.</a>  Lister? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9455.351s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9456.111s">Order</a>  of information, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9457.872s">Brie,</a>  would you be OK with acknowledging, well, maybe not acknowledging, but inserting a line that the blended sentence story in the royal house <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9472.322s">is</a>  part of the curriculum of Medford schools?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9475.203s">That</a>  might be in the next, I think.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9477.043s">Already</a>  in the slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9478.543s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9479.944s">Already</a>  in the next slide.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9481.204s">I</a>  think there's a, if I remember correct, can I go to the next slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9483.964s">Are</a>  we okay?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9484.685s">We</a>  all set with this one?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9485.605s">I</a>  think it's one of the citizens' inputs.</p>

    <p>[Brothers]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9490.706s">I</a>  do want to acknowledge whatever Matt's asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9493.066s">I</a>  think it's in the next slide.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9495.707s">Should</a>  we move on to the next slide, Mr. Chairman? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9498.267s">Motion?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9500.448s">Everybody</a>  happy with the slide?</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9503.241s">Can</a>  we go back to it if what Matt is saying is not in the next slide?</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9506.925s">We</a>  have two raised hands here.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9509.727s">Can</a>  we go to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9511.229s">Can</a>  somebody who actually works in the Medford school system or maybe Lee, what is the actual curriculum that is taught to the children who visit the royal house? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9522.3s">Is</a>  it strictly focused on Belinda Sutton? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9524.722s">I</a>  need that question answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9526.043s">I</a>  feel like I've asked it twice now. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9528.475s">Is</a>  she a piece of the history or is she the entire history of the Royal House?</p>

    <p>[Mackenzie]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9532.756s">I</a>  think Janelle answered that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9533.936s">I</a>  spoke on this briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9535.197s">I've</a>  been to the tour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9536.657s">It's</a>  not specifically focused on Belinda Sutton, but she is something that they do include, they talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9543.119s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9543.339s">So</a>  I think to say that she's mentioned there, it's a given. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9546.74s">I</a>  think to highlight that and make it seem like she is in Broadway lights at the Royal House and that's what we talk about there is, again, disingenuous. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9555.877s">We</a>  need to put the facts on the table.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9558.94s">Mr.</a>  Lister. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9560.341s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9562.743s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9564.484s">I</a>  certainly wouldn't want to put her in Broadway lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9568.487s">I</a>  would just simply mention that as part of the curriculum, the royal house is toured by fifth graders and blend this story.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9576.274s">It's</a>  on the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9577.315s">If</a>  we get to it.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9578.455s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9578.996s">Well,</a>  you interrupted me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9580.237s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9581.935s">And</a>  point of information, in terms of the curriculum, the children do learn her story as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9586.297s">I</a>  know my daughter did not do the tour of the royal house probably because of COVID, but she did learn about the story of Belinda Sutton, I believe in the third grade.</p>

    <p>[Mackenzie]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9596.282s">Yeah,</a>  the third graders do like where they dress up of different members, like different historical people. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9604.406s">And</a>  she's one of the names on the list of characters or people that they may dress up in third grade.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9612.166s">Point</a>  of information, we did third grade remote last year and we did learn about the slave trade in Medford that included the Brooks, which we have a school named after. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9620.211s">And</a>  not once did I see in any of the information that we were presented in third grade to include Belinda Sutton, but we did learn about the rum trade with the slaves for the Brooks family. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9632.478s">So</a>  I think we need to take a deeper look into what is being taught because I did remote third grade last year and I don't ever recall Belinda Sutton's name coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9642.443s">So</a>  again, I could just put facts out there.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9646.086s">Point</a>  of something. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9649.689s">What's</a>  being taught in the school is out of our purview and I know that the schools are working on racial equity and working to adjust to <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9659.57s">adjust</a>  and add to the school curriculums with the teachers as well as doing an overview of the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9667.674s">So</a>  if you would like to see more, I would suggest you go send them a letter to that suggestion.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9679.2s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9680.712s">Can</a>  we stick to this now? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9682.173s">We</a>  run.</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9682.934s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. Chair, just answer the question about what's on the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9686.538s">I</a>  just want to say from my own experience that I'm just, I'm sort of embarrassed to say that I didn't know anything about Belinda Sutton until my child brought that to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9695.046s">I</a>  believe it was in the third grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9697.008s">So</a>  at some point it is in the curriculum.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9699.751s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kathleen Kay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9701.076s">And</a>  if, may I just for clarity, the third grade does biographies. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9705.979s">So</a>  it depends on the year and if a child chooses Belinda Sutton to read and do their project on. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9711.523s">So</a>  it's not like she's excluded from the curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9714.725s">It's</a>  not like she's the major highlight either. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9716.406s">The</a>  children just have a list of books they can choose from, Belinda Sutton being one of them in the third grade.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9722.09s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9724.491s">All</a>  right, we happy with this slide? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9725.932s">We're</a>  gonna move to the next one.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9728.269s">Folks,</a>  we have 10 minutes and then I have to move to the budget hearing.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9731.25s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, are we going to have to go to the school committee and ask for another week? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9738.111s">Because</a>  as we only have 10 minutes left and we haven't even finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9743.393s">We</a>  have another meeting this week.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9744.953s">There</a>  is a Lisa.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9748.674s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm the advisor to the club and we have to vote that evening on awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9753.735s">I</a>  was the only night that the coaches could meet.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9757.26s">Friday.</a> </p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9758.381s">So</a>  we need to, I really would rather not meet on a Friday unless it's like two to four or three to five the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9766.968s">I</a>  just a question.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9772.213s">I</a>  thought that we had discussed earlier that we did not need to have Lisa evangelist there as a note taker, since the meetings are recorded.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9784.717s">No,</a>  we do need somebody because then I'm going to have to go back and watch the meeting and in order to get it all done and ready for the seventh, I'm not sure I'd be able to do that.</p>

    <p>[Grace Caldara]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9799.06s">Could</a>  the superintendent find another note taker for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9805.162s">My</a>  understanding is it just needs to be anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9808.422s">I</a>  understand that there are some <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9811.383s">I</a>  understand there's two of you that are designated for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9818.405s">Is</a>  there anybody else that could potentially step in for us if we need to in order for us to get this done?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9823.286s">You'd</a>  have to pay somebody else.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9834.118s">Ron's</a>  original, Ron's original.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9836.499s">I</a>  can do two to four or three to five, but it's going to be tough to get the notes ready for Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9845.684s">But</a>  anyway.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9847.265s">That's</a>  why originally Ron did ask for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9851.227s">And</a>  unfortunately we voted for only given one week to June 7th. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9855.749s">And</a>  we should have listened to Ron from the beginning and went with the two weeks because this is the problem that we're having. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9861.992s">We're</a>  not going to finish.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9864.042s">Pulling</a>  for an order of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9865.622s">We</a>  need to stick on our agenda.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9867.203s">I</a>  can ask to see if Susie can do Thursday, but I'm not sure if she's helping with the prom, because that's also Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9875.225s">I</a>  told you guys it was just a tough week.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9878.706s">Lisa,</a>  what's the advanced posting, though, the requirement on the posting?</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9881.846s">Oh,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9882.466s">Yeah,</a>  I need 48 hours.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9883.607s">So</a>  it would have to be Friday.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9885.747s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9886.607s">Good</a>  point there, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9887.908s">You</a>  got it.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9888.328s">So</a>  it's either Friday, or we were asking for another extension.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9894.12s">Yeah,</a>  and Grace did mention, other people mentioned, I think a week or so ago, that we might have to ask for another extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9899.407s">I</a>  don't think we should rush this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9901.37s">As</a>  I tell my art students, don't rush.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9904.654s">Thank</a>  you, Matt. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9905.415s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9906.176s">You</a>  need to ask for an extension, please.</p>

    <p>[Hill]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9909.08s">From</a>  a point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9912.084s">From</a>  a point of information, the committee could theoretically just move to submit the transcripts as is and then amend as needed at the convenience of the stat.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9934.541s">Point</a>  of information, Seth, I know this for a fact, that is against open meeting law rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9941.201s">Thanks</a>  for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9942.302s">Good</a>  idea, but it is against open meeting law.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9945.385s">Can</a>  we ask Mr. Cushing to hire somebody for us for Friday? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9949.828s">That</a>  seems like the only option to me.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9952.791s">Wasn't</a>  Dr. Cushing the one that told us that we could start the meeting without a note taker because of the transcription service? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9960.797s">I</a>  know that was before you came on Lisa, but that's what Dr. Cushing had said when Jim talked about waiting for you to get here.</p>

    <p>[Haberstroh]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9968.623s">Yeah,</a>  I would propose we try to meet on Friday and Mr. Lister, if you can try to find somebody for through Mr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Evangelista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9975.208s">When</a>  you say Friday, what time folks, because it's a Friday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9978.21s">I</a>  don't think that's appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Miguel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9982.013s">I'm</a>  sorry, but if you want to do information, I would not be available until four due to my full-time commitment to my job. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9989.139s">So</a>  if we can keep it after four, that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9991.38s">Thank</a>  you for everybody at all on Friday.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=9997.631s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, I go back to, again, I am not rushing this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10005.237s">I</a>  think that we should have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10007.478s">A</a>  year it took to get to us, they gave us a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10012.522s">How</a>  could we possibly get it together? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10016.205s">We're</a>  doing our due diligence to make a quality presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10019.588s">I</a>  think we ask for another week, we meet on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10023.481s">to</a>  continue this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10024.762s">Just</a>  think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10025.983s">Friday</a>  we've got to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10027.645s">That</a>  means we've got to put it all together and have it ready for Monday? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10030.487s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10032.729s">And</a>  Mr. Chair, if I say Lisa said that we had a 15 minute presentation when we need a half hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10039.595s">So</a>  we need to put on the agenda that we need a half hour to 45 minutes for our presentation.</p>

    <p>[Scalise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10045.58s">May</a>  I ask a rules question? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10046.822s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10051.603s">If</a>  we as the subcommittee of 10 that are working on this, if we are stay under quorum, are we able to meet in a Zoom to continue working together to do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10065.669s">I</a>  have a business level Zoom that has no time limit and I can have people in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10072.992s">I</a>  would be willing to host that at a time convenient for everybody if we could work that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10078.814s">I</a>  just don't know if that is against the rules.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10080.717s">Point</a>  of information, believe me, I want to do that more than you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10085.639s">However,</a>  I know from the Attorney General's office, all our deliberations need to be done in public with the same rules as the open meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10094.703s">Okay,</a>  even if we keep it below the quorum?</p>

    <p>[Rotolo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10095.924s">Not</a>  if they're under quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10097.704s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10098.004s">Not</a>  if they're under quorum.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10099.685s">That</a>  is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10100.646s">The</a>  quorum, our subcommittee is its own separate public body.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10105.008s">No,</a>  no, it's not.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10107.152s">It's</a>  not.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10107.513s">Patrick,</a>  I will say. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10108.934s">It's</a>  a work group established through our committee.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10112.456s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10114.738s">It's</a>  not a subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10117.219s">I</a>  mean, I'm no expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10118.66s">That's</a>  why I went to go to do this research. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10121.523s">But</a>  point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10123.024s">Do</a>  you want me to read it? <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10123.824s">I</a>  don't know if you want me to read it or not.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10126.226s">I'm</a>  familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10127.167s">I</a>  read it.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10127.607s">Go</a>  read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10129.248s">The</a>  10-person subcommittee of the advisory committee is also a public body in its own right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10135.398s">This</a>  means that the subcommittee must follow all of the requirements of an open meeting law, including the prohibition on a quorum deliberating, deliberating out. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10146.128s">Let</a>  me finish the deliberating outside of meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10149.372s">Deliberation</a>  is defined as any oral or written communication through any media between or amongst the quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10156.09s">of</a>  a public body on a public business within its jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10160.374s">To</a>  be deliberation, the communication must reach a quorum of the public body, which is the subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10167.24s">An</a>  email from... Who's this from, Ron?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10171.203s">This</a>  is from the Attorney General's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10174.105s">The</a>  first line is the 10 person subcommittee of the advisory committee is a public body in its own right. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10180.877s">That's</a>  its first sentence, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10182.699s">Again,</a>  I defer to you, but it's in writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10186.102s">I</a>  mean, this is their opinion.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10187.884s">Are</a>  you able to show that to us?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10193.41s">I</a>  can send it to you all, but I don't think you guys get my email.</p>

    <p>[Rocha]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10196.133s">Are</a>  we going to ask for an extension here, everybody?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10199.055s">I'm</a>  going to send this to Patrick as the post.</p>

    <p>[McCabe]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10203.934s">Well,</a>  I also need to see what the original, what you were asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10208.257s">I'll</a>  send you the whole thing.</p>

    <p>[Paul Donato Jr]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10210.739s">One</a>  minute extension, please.</p>

    <p>[Jim Lister]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10215.463s">All</a>  those in favor of asking for another week. <a href="https://youtu.be/pPBnQqSullw&t=10217.585s">No,</a>  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p>
