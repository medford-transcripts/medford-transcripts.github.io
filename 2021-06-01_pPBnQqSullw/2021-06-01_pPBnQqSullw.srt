00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:02,675
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I have a few people that wanna speak first.

178
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:04,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Brian, did you wanna speak?

179
00:05:06,578 --> 00:05:07,359
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, can you hear me?

180
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:08,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

181
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,602
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I just briefly appreciate

182
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:19,776
[SPEAKER_22]: five minutes of your time to just talk a little bit about this process before we get into the details.

183
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:40,686
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's important for people who were not part of the subcommittee group to understand that my feeling is that the process was flawed, direction we were in was flawed, and I did not feel in any way, shape, or form collaboration, and that is why I stopped editing.

184
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:46,245
[SPEAKER_22]: The process went very smoothly when we're talking about generic process descriptions.

185
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,266
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought things were moving in a great direction.

186
00:05:48,286 --> 00:05:53,029
[SPEAKER_22]: I started with, I volunteered to do Jean Barry Sutherland.

187
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,072
[SPEAKER_22]: I started with 14 slides, went down to 10, went down to five, ended up with four.

188
00:05:58,092 --> 00:06:03,876
[SPEAKER_22]: I accepted, believe me, this has nothing to do with content, all about process.

189
00:06:05,257 --> 00:06:06,598
[SPEAKER_22]: Emails were not returned.

190
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:10,060
[SPEAKER_22]: There was no collaboration from the committee as far as I was concerned.

191
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:30,526
[SPEAKER_22]: So when I woke up on Sunday and saw that not only did we not discuss my presentation, my presentation was edited, deleted, and words were replaced without any conversation with me at all, which I find highly unprofessional.

192
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,104
[SPEAKER_22]: So on May 31st of 518, I wrote to the team and I'll read it to you.

193
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:45,871
[SPEAKER_22]: Team, I'm not sure who decided that my entry on the presentation should be changed and did so without any communication with me, but I am very disappointed.

194
00:06:47,172 --> 00:06:51,115
[SPEAKER_22]: We are a team and yet all my emails on process were ignored.

195
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:55,739
[SPEAKER_22]: Jim Lister, the chairman is still not included on this email chain.

196
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:00,513
[SPEAKER_22]: I will formally bring this up at tomorrow's meeting, meaning tonight.

197
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:10,661
[SPEAKER_22]: When this committee failed to move forward, I suggested that we at least begin a base attempt to at least begin a discussion at tonight's meeting.

198
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:17,166
[SPEAKER_22]: I do not remember assigning a person to change my words and format at will.

199
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:23,832
[SPEAKER_22]: In my opinion, this is the height of arrogance and completely disrespectful to the work of a fellow member.

200
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:29,766
[SPEAKER_22]: Should I go in now and completely change the other two presentations without your knowledge or consent?

201
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:34,148
[SPEAKER_22]: I would never, because I have respect for everyone's effort.

202
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:43,130
[SPEAKER_22]: I had hoped that we could demonstrate that we are a team, but this action is the last straw.

203
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,272
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, we all have to stay up tonight to watch our proposals to see if anyone will change them.

204
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:55,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Common courtesy and professionalism dictates that you should show respect for others' efforts.

205
00:07:55,769 --> 00:07:57,310
[SPEAKER_22]: Respect is all I ask.

206
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:06,017
[SPEAKER_22]: It was just incredible to me that this was going on.

207
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,679
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I'm shocked.

208
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,441
[SPEAKER_22]: And somebody mentioned that maybe that was the process.

209
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:13,683
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it wasn't the process I understood.

210
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:27,064
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want everybody to understand, and we'll go through line by line, because I told the people this morning who were slashing my presentation even more, that I would not edit any more until we get to tonight.

211
00:08:27,264 --> 00:08:33,626
[SPEAKER_22]: And you'll see some of the things that need to be changed and what the effort is, in my opinion, to get that change.

212
00:08:33,686 --> 00:08:36,107
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm all for change, but not this way.

213
00:08:36,662 --> 00:08:37,563
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your time.

214
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:39,444
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not really a discussable issue.

215
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:40,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's move on to the vote.

216
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:41,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

217
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:43,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so sorry to hear that.

218
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:45,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have an email like that from you.

219
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:46,230
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know who that was.

220
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Nor do I. Nor do I. I just searched.

221
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:52,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I just am checking my email as you're speaking.

222
00:08:52,194 --> 00:08:53,856
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have that email from you.

223
00:08:54,796 --> 00:08:55,057
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

224
00:08:55,317 --> 00:08:56,238
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, it's possible.

225
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:57,759
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I have it here.

226
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:05,445
[SPEAKER_22]: It's in my sent folder, but irregardless of my letter, I could write it today with the same feeling.

227
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:13,890
[SPEAKER_22]: The fact remains, my words, my style, my format was changed without a word to me.

228
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,312
[SPEAKER_22]: The email still works.

229
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:23,836
[SPEAKER_22]: A committee is a collaboration by definition.

230
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:31,241
[SPEAKER_22]: And it just saddens me that, very disappointed that that process had to exist.

231
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,123
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

232
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:34,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ron.

233
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody else?

234
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:39,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Now's the time.

235
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Ken has his hand up.

236
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,183
[SPEAKER_26]: There are several hands up.

237
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:57,248
[SPEAKER_12]: I was also under the impression that this was to be a collaborative effort through email.

238
00:09:58,968 --> 00:10:03,210
[SPEAKER_12]: People were collaborating through email, and then all communication stopped.

239
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,211
[SPEAKER_12]: People would ask people's opinion.

240
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,601
[SPEAKER_12]: and then there would be no response.

241
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:12,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Ron, I'm sorry, I don't have your email.

242
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:14,485
[SPEAKER_12]: It did not come through to me.

243
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:16,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Who did you send it to?

244
00:10:16,487 --> 00:10:22,771
[SPEAKER_22]: Sent it to the presentation committee.

245
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:28,894
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, if I read it now or read it three days ago, the action still happened.

246
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,250
[SPEAKER_12]: We could have addressed this three days ago if people on the committee got it.

247
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:38,472
[SPEAKER_12]: There are several people on the committee who are saying they never received this email.

248
00:10:39,092 --> 00:10:40,493
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand what you're saying.

249
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:42,494
[SPEAKER_22]: The action still happened.

250
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:48,876
[SPEAKER_22]: The email is the words of my email, whether I say it now or had sent it is not relevant.

251
00:10:49,127 --> 00:10:49,587
[SPEAKER_12]: It is.

252
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:56,690
[SPEAKER_12]: It is very relevant because there are people who would have said, you're right.

253
00:10:57,111 --> 00:10:58,331
[SPEAKER_12]: That shouldn't be happening.

254
00:10:58,511 --> 00:10:59,692
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to discuss this.

255
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,052
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs to be a discussion.

256
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:09,396
[SPEAKER_12]: If you'll notice, when you sent your presentation, I said in email, I think this needs to be shorter.

257
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,698
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to standardize the slides.

258
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:17,820
[SPEAKER_12]: And there were some fluff things in there that we could

259
00:11:18,348 --> 00:11:22,369
[SPEAKER_12]: put onto a single slide from five down to one.

260
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't make that change in the presentation.

261
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:30,150
[SPEAKER_12]: I just sent a screenshot of what I was proposing.

262
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,951
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not make a single change to your slide.

263
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:38,292
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a little bit of discussion after that, and then it just petered off.

264
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:39,332
[SPEAKER_12]: You did not weigh in.

265
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:42,612
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of order, Mr. Chair.

266
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,873
[SPEAKER_23]: All comments should be going through the chair.

267
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:46,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

268
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:48,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

269
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:52,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Why am I not seeing the raised hands?

270
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:56,237
[SPEAKER_26]: Maria has her hand up.

271
00:11:57,357 --> 00:12:06,183
[SPEAKER_23]: If you look at the list of participants, put that to the right hand side on your screen, you should see all the names and there's four hands raised right now.

272
00:12:06,564 --> 00:12:06,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

273
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:08,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Maria, go ahead.

274
00:12:10,186 --> 00:12:12,848
[SPEAKER_10]: I am quite frankly very

275
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:14,705
[SPEAKER_10]: confused.

276
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:21,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Every single person on the subcommittee had edit access.

277
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:23,987
[SPEAKER_10]: They had the ability to make comments.

278
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:31,069
[SPEAKER_10]: We were making comments based on what we thought needed to be changed.

279
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:33,830
[SPEAKER_10]: There was absolutely no

280
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:38,212
[SPEAKER_10]: assigning of anyone to a specific name.

281
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:41,413
[SPEAKER_10]: If you wanted to work on Jean Barry Sutherland, that's great.

282
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:48,415
[SPEAKER_10]: But every single other subcommittee member also had the right to make edits and comments.

283
00:12:49,056 --> 00:12:51,036
[SPEAKER_10]: That is how the process was working.

284
00:12:53,257 --> 00:13:04,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I did not receive any emails from you past the point of your having sent your full presentation, and having shortened it to four slides I believe.

285
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:19,741
[SPEAKER_10]: multiple people asked exactly what your issues were regarding the process, and you simply did not reply fully.

286
00:13:19,821 --> 00:13:27,544
[SPEAKER_10]: You did not fully express what your issues with the process were, at least not clearly to me.

287
00:13:27,564 --> 00:13:30,285
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may say so, I

288
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,084
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand not wanting to have your work completely edited down.

289
00:13:39,224 --> 00:13:51,416
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I will say that the majority of your sentiments and your statements verbatim are included on what we have right now.

290
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:58,622
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that in terms of collaboration, that is what a collaboration is.

291
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:06,810
[SPEAKER_10]: it's editing someone else's words down so that it fits better to the purpose.

292
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:25,316
[SPEAKER_10]: So while I understand some of your issues with the process, I don't believe that it's a reason to be halting the entire editing process for the sake of this.

293
00:14:29,158 --> 00:14:29,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

294
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Melissa, do you have your hand up?

295
00:14:31,635 --> 00:14:42,485
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, for some reason, I don't have that function, but I did want to speak if we're speaking a point of information through the chair on process.

296
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:52,655
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to speak to last week, I had mentioned that I feel my role on this committee is to represent the citizens of Medford, we can't have

297
00:14:53,666 --> 00:15:02,370
[SPEAKER_20]: 50,000 people join on a Zoom call and give their input onto why or why not the Columbus School should be renamed and why or why not a name should be selected.

298
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:09,713
[SPEAKER_20]: However, I have grave concerns with the language being used on the presentation that we are putting forward.

299
00:15:10,413 --> 00:15:18,817
[SPEAKER_20]: The school committee has asked or tasked us with putting forth a name to help heal and bring the community together.

300
00:15:18,837 --> 00:15:21,738
[SPEAKER_20]: And as we have all witnessed from day one,

301
00:15:22,202 --> 00:15:30,528
[SPEAKER_20]: This entire process, names that are being put forward and everything else is doing everything except bring this community together.

302
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:38,054
[SPEAKER_20]: The names that we are putting forward came from the input from the community.

303
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:49,282
[SPEAKER_20]: And I find it grossly alarming that one of the names that we are putting forward to the school committee did not even make it in the top three submissions from the community.

304
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,318
[SPEAKER_20]: There is something wrong here.

305
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,643
[SPEAKER_20]: There is something wrong with this process, and it needs to be addressed.

306
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:00,747
[SPEAKER_20]: And if nobody's going to say it, I'm going to say it.

307
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:02,970
[SPEAKER_20]: There's something wrong here.

308
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:11,180
[SPEAKER_20]: Last year, a committee member put forth that he was going to name the committee, the school, after a member of this community, regardless

309
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:22,487
[SPEAKER_20]: of what any taxpayer, any community member, or any child, including mine, that sits in the classroom at the Columbus School and hella high water, he was gonna name the school that name.

310
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:24,068
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know what?

311
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,009
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't live in a dictatorship.

312
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:39,437
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't find it, I don't appreciate it at all that I sit here representing my neighbors, my friends, families at the community that I consider family, and somehow a name that nobody wants

313
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:41,905
[SPEAKER_20]: is now being put forward.

314
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:47,470
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the name on this committee that it has the most votes going forward.

315
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,192
[SPEAKER_23]: If nobody's gonna- Point of order, Mr. Chair.

316
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:52,594
[SPEAKER_23]: We took a vote and 12 votes.

317
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:56,297
[SPEAKER_23]: The majority of this committee voted to send the name forward.

318
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:59,139
[SPEAKER_20]: And my issue is not- Point of order, Mr. Chair.

319
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:00,780
[SPEAKER_20]: No, you're not gonna cut me off.

320
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:04,723
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not gonna cut me off if you don't like what I'm saying.

321
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:09,047
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing to do with my- If you don't like what I'm saying, you're not gonna cut me off.

322
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:13,633
[SPEAKER_20]: and I will not allow you to cut me off, I will allow you to let me speak.

323
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,857
[SPEAKER_20]: My opinion here may not be the popular one.

324
00:17:17,997 --> 00:17:21,500
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't know if it's not the popular one, okay?

325
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:34,632
[SPEAKER_20]: But we're speaking on process here and I am backing up Ron's thoughts on the process and I for not one minute do not support the presentation nor the process and I want that on record.

326
00:17:34,995 --> 00:17:35,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of order.

327
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:36,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of order.

328
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:42,357
[SPEAKER_10]: We're discussing the process of the present creation.

329
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,178
[SPEAKER_17]: You have your hand up, Kristen.

330
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:46,718
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of order, Mr. Chair.

331
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,338
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no motion on the floor.

332
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:56,761
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's put a motion on the floor if there's something to discuss rather than just a general discussion about whether or not people like or do not like a process.

333
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I've given the right to one to speak.

334
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:01,802
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to give the right to the other three that have their hand up, and then we'll move on.

335
00:18:03,288 --> 00:18:04,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Kristen, would you like to say something?

336
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

337
00:18:08,911 --> 00:18:13,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to say that I didn't receive the email that Ron was referring to.

338
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:17,015
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had, I would have been happy to work.

339
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:19,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I was looking at all of the stuff over the weekend.

340
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:25,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have been happy to continue to work on it as a group.

341
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:32,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, people are using the notes, the comment function that is built into Google

342
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,173
[SPEAKER_08]: what do they call their version of PowerPoint slides?

343
00:18:37,554 --> 00:18:39,875
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought it was working okay.

344
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:41,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is always retrievable.

345
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:45,538
[SPEAKER_08]: So any changes can always be undone.

346
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:49,460
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go back to previous versions.

347
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:56,184
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I had gotten that email from Ron on the 31st, I would have been happy to work on things.

348
00:18:56,244 --> 00:19:02,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we do all understand that the presentation does need to be

349
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:05,468
[SPEAKER_08]: consistent between the three options.

350
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:08,249
[SPEAKER_08]: So changes are going to have to be made.

351
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:19,311
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think we can, if we had just discussed this at the time, it would have been, you know, I don't think it would have been too much of a chore to find a way to come together on it.

352
00:19:20,111 --> 00:19:24,812
[SPEAKER_08]: In regards to what Melissa was saying, I understand that she is saying she is taking input from the community.

353
00:19:24,892 --> 00:19:25,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's wonderful.

354
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:28,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're all here for that reason.

355
00:19:28,493 --> 00:19:30,793
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're all taking input from people

356
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,195
[SPEAKER_08]: in the community.

357
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:39,779
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know people and we're all of the community and we should all be taking all of that into account.

358
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:44,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we're all talking, we have different contexts in the community where we have different groups.

359
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:46,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody has different opinions.

360
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:49,503
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we're on this committee.

361
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:54,965
[SPEAKER_08]: And when Melissa says that, you know, something wasn't, you know

362
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I don't want to misquote, but I already forgot, you know, something wasn't what the people voted on.

363
00:20:01,815 --> 00:20:15,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we did get a wealth of public comments, which were all fantastic to read and go through in their own way, but they were a small portion of Medford residents.

364
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:22,872
[SPEAKER_08]: So even just saying, well, we're not going with what those people wanted, those aren't all the people in the community.

365
00:20:26,347 --> 00:20:36,891
[SPEAKER_08]: both the survey and the public comments, but I think, I don't know, I think we have three excellent options and we're not making the final choice.

366
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:41,493
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think everyone has an option that we'd be happy with.

367
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,694
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be happy with any of the three.

368
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:53,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're all fantastic, but I really do think we can make a good decision out of what we have if we're just more open with each other.

369
00:20:53,137 --> 00:20:55,058
[SPEAKER_17]: That's it.

370
00:20:55,738 --> 00:20:56,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

371
00:20:56,547 --> 00:21:08,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Laura, would you like to speak very quickly just reiterate the technical piece of this, um, that I don't know how Roger Venus.

372
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,769
[SPEAKER_11]: input got removed or changed.

373
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:14,990
[SPEAKER_11]: But I certainly don't read anything nefarious into that.

374
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,510
[SPEAKER_11]: It could have been accidental.

375
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,751
[SPEAKER_11]: It could have been somebody misunderstanding the process.

376
00:21:19,171 --> 00:21:21,772
[SPEAKER_11]: But the beauty of Google Slides is that there's a history there.

377
00:21:21,832 --> 00:21:23,993
[SPEAKER_11]: We can always just redo everything.

378
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,453
[SPEAKER_11]: We can go back and start over.

379
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:29,234
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really hope that we're given the chance to do that.

380
00:21:29,615 --> 00:21:31,135
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also did not receive that email.

381
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:35,096
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would have reacted very much like others have said to engage in that process.

382
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:37,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly don't want anybody to feel like their work

383
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,620
[SPEAKER_11]: is being ignored because we're all putting so much time and effort into this.

384
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:47,425
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope that we can sort of go back to the slide and fix it so that everybody's voice is heard.

385
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:49,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

386
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:51,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth, did you have your hand up?

387
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:54,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

388
00:21:54,451 --> 00:21:56,993
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm formally calling for orders of the day.

389
00:21:57,233 --> 00:22:02,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We have specifically on the agenda that we are going to

390
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:06,554
[SPEAKER_03]: review the presentation, if there is actually a presentation.

391
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:08,874
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's actually review it.

392
00:22:09,154 --> 00:22:10,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

393
00:22:11,015 --> 00:22:11,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

394
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:15,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So is it now in the Google Drive?

395
00:22:17,456 --> 00:22:18,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it is.

396
00:22:18,197 --> 00:22:18,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we bring it up?

397
00:22:20,377 --> 00:22:21,257
[SPEAKER_17]: Can somebody bring it up?

398
00:22:24,478 --> 00:22:25,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I can bring it up.

399
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have screen share permission?

400
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,159
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's only host.

401
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So the host has to change it to participants.

402
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,645
[SPEAKER_08]: which actually could get dicey.

403
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:45,390
[SPEAKER_08]: If the host is able to get into the drive and share it, that would be best for Zoom security.

404
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,712
[SPEAKER_26]: It can make you the host too, Kristen.

405
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:48,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, OK.

406
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:48,372
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

407
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,993
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm not.

408
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:16,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, I think I got it.

409
00:23:22,356 --> 00:23:24,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Can everybody see the thank you slide?

410
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:25,097
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

411
00:23:25,577 --> 00:23:26,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let me go back to the beginning.

412
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:39,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chair, can a motion be made to see Ron's presentation in its entirety?

413
00:23:40,202 --> 00:23:40,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

414
00:23:41,277 --> 00:23:44,398
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of order, I'd prefer just to move on, thank you.

415
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:48,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

416
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,640
[SPEAKER_22]: There's enough content there that we can have a decent discussion about my slides.

417
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

418
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,581
[SPEAKER_11]: As a point of clarification, do we know how much time we will have to present this?

419
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:01,642
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think there's a limit.

420
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:02,922
[SPEAKER_17]: No one said that we have to.

421
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:09,424
[SPEAKER_17]: How long, Ron, roughly how long does this presentation take, what we have?

422
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:11,864
[SPEAKER_22]: this complete presentation?

423
00:24:11,884 --> 00:24:12,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

424
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:17,808
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I wasn't involved in the speaker notes, so you probably should ask somebody who wrote the speaker notes.

425
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,209
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm guessing 15 minutes.

426
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,372
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm not worried about time then, I guess.

427
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:29,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we the only thing on the school committee agenda when it gets presented?

428
00:24:29,576 --> 00:24:33,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there's time limits with them having the Zoom account.

429
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,201
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I don't think we are.

430
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:38,382
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Kathy Kay, I'm sorry.

431
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:39,883
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think we're the only thing on the agenda.

432
00:24:45,237 --> 00:24:47,859
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just 30 slides, so I don't think 15 minutes.

433
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we're going to make it in 15 minutes.

434
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:56,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and then our script could be different than what's on the slide.

435
00:24:57,165 --> 00:24:59,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes that's an approach that people take.

436
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:04,370
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just want to make sure we have enough time to share the right amount of info.

437
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:06,551
[SPEAKER_08]: But tell me when you guys want me to move to another slide.

438
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:07,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

439
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:16,268
[SPEAKER_22]: just point of order, can we make that any bigger?

440
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:19,730
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think the comments are really important.

441
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:24,493
[SPEAKER_22]: The comments all need to be addressed, if they need to be.

442
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:30,496
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that, it kind of pushes them down and gets them out of frame.

443
00:25:31,056 --> 00:25:31,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that any better?

444
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:33,738
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm just old.

445
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:35,799
[SPEAKER_22]: I have my cheaters.

446
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:37,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand.

447
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the same one.

448
00:25:41,902 --> 00:25:42,422
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that one.

449
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:43,743
[SPEAKER_08]: How's that?

450
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,860
[SPEAKER_08]: It just takes them out of frame, unfortunately.

451
00:25:50,281 --> 00:25:53,222
[SPEAKER_20]: I think once it's up on being projected, it'll be big enough.

452
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:56,663
[SPEAKER_20]: I just think, unfortunately, on our small screens right now, it looks smaller than it will be.

453
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if I can get rid of the sidebar.

454
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:02,364
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going to say, it looks pretty OK on a 36-inch monitor.

455
00:26:02,484 --> 00:26:04,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Stop bragging.

456
00:26:06,725 --> 00:26:09,206
[SPEAKER_21]: It's also not in present mode.

457
00:26:09,466 --> 00:26:09,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

458
00:26:11,046 --> 00:26:11,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

459
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:12,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so used to PowerPoint.

460
00:26:12,646 --> 00:26:13,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this present mode, right?

461
00:26:14,027 --> 00:26:14,807
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's explore.

462
00:26:16,338 --> 00:26:17,399
[SPEAKER_21]: It's the white box up here.

463
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:19,520
[SPEAKER_08]: This one?

464
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,221
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I just think if you hit present, you're going to lose the comment section.

465
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:24,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're right.

466
00:26:24,642 --> 00:26:25,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Ron's right.

467
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:26,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I will lose the comment.

468
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:40,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that people are able to zoom in onto the screen by clicking next to where it says you are viewing Kristen Scalise's screen or it says view options, zoom ratio.

469
00:26:41,129 --> 00:26:42,810
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's different percentages.

470
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,231
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might make it easier to read.

471
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:56,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, just let me know where you guys want me to go.

472
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:11,945
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so on bullet point number four, I had said that those names, if our names are going to be listed in alphabetical order by last name, it should be Mr. Tuck, Dean Barry Sutherland, Belinda Sutton, and additional recommendations.

473
00:27:12,746 --> 00:27:13,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds good.

474
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:15,466
[SPEAKER_20]: I think everything should be in alphabetical order.

475
00:27:15,486 --> 00:27:16,787
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree.

476
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:19,647
[SPEAKER_20]: For consistency, I think.

477
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:22,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I ask why additional recommendations is there?

478
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:26,254
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, three is three.

479
00:27:26,274 --> 00:27:40,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I think someone had pointed out that if there was a way to honor all of the options, all 18, that we would suggest that the school might wanna look into doing that.

480
00:27:41,148 --> 00:27:47,795
[SPEAKER_17]: But that wasn't, I read that, but that wasn't what we were set to do here.

481
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,957
[SPEAKER_17]: We would come back with three and only three.

482
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:52,304
[SPEAKER_24]: Aren't they going to have that information anyway?

483
00:27:53,024 --> 00:27:53,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

484
00:27:53,645 --> 00:27:54,045
[SPEAKER_24]: Be a top 18.

485
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:54,445
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

486
00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:57,587
[SPEAKER_24]: So I get rid of additional recommendations.

487
00:27:58,467 --> 00:27:58,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

488
00:28:00,068 --> 00:28:01,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, this is Matt Amherstro.

489
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:02,389
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks, Matt.

490
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,270
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

491
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was hard to alphabetize, because mistletoe is just a word.

492
00:28:08,972 --> 00:28:12,554
[SPEAKER_08]: So then you start thinking, well, alphabetize by first word.

493
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:19,618
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it should be mistletoe, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Belinda Sutton, as I had noted on the side.

494
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:20,770
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I am.

495
00:28:26,195 --> 00:28:31,419
[SPEAKER_23]: Should I move on?

496
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:37,864
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. Chair, there's a motion tonight for an additional recommendation, so.

497
00:28:38,525 --> 00:28:39,946
[SPEAKER_17]: That motion's out of order.

498
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:41,567
[SPEAKER_17]: I already took care of that.

499
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:44,509
[SPEAKER_17]: That can go to the school committee or the city council.

500
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,772
[SPEAKER_17]: That has nothing to do with our scope of what we're doing.

501
00:28:51,368 --> 00:28:53,569
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what you're being out of order.

502
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:56,130
[SPEAKER_23]: It's on the formal, it's on the formal.

503
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,391
[SPEAKER_23]: It's out of order.

504
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:03,233
[SPEAKER_23]: How did it get on the agenda if it's out of order?

505
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:06,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone put it on the agenda.

506
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:12,857
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyone on this committee has the ability to bring a motion forward.

507
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,058
[SPEAKER_23]: You don't decide that a motion is out of order.

508
00:29:16,803 --> 00:29:20,105
[SPEAKER_18]: It has nothing to do with what we're here for.

509
00:29:20,545 --> 00:29:22,867
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what the committee would then decide.

510
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:23,887
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not deciding.

511
00:29:23,907 --> 00:29:25,248
[SPEAKER_18]: There's the chair, I'm telling you.

512
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:27,049
[SPEAKER_18]: It has nothing to do with what we're doing here.

513
00:29:27,589 --> 00:29:30,971
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess you don't understand the responsibility of the chair.

514
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:32,652
[SPEAKER_23]: You're not the person to determine.

515
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:34,253
[SPEAKER_23]: Go to the city council with us.

516
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,135
[SPEAKER_23]: It doesn't have anything to do with what we're doing here.

517
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:40,257
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not your job as the chair to decide what that is.

518
00:29:40,277 --> 00:29:41,718
[SPEAKER_23]: It's for the committee to decide.

519
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:45,840
[SPEAKER_18]: My job is to decide what the committee gets to decide on.

520
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,191
[SPEAKER_18]: That is not true.

521
00:29:48,211 --> 00:29:50,352
[SPEAKER_18]: It is tonight.

522
00:29:50,912 --> 00:29:51,252
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

523
00:29:52,193 --> 00:29:52,593
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

524
00:29:54,514 --> 00:29:55,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we hear the motion?

525
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:56,796
[SPEAKER_17]: We also on the slide.

526
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:29,606
[SPEAKER_17]: We all sit with this slide.

527
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:31,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody agree on this one?

528
00:30:33,891 --> 00:30:34,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

529
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:37,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we go to the next one, please?

530
00:31:03,996 --> 00:31:04,996
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone agree on this one?

531
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:10,158
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

532
00:31:11,538 --> 00:31:13,639
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not double checking the dates, but it looks fine.

533
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

534
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Go to the next one.

535
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:22,181
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

536
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:55,035
[SPEAKER_17]: This one look okay to everybody?

537
00:31:55,856 --> 00:32:15,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, can we go to the next one?

538
00:32:23,815 --> 00:32:25,576
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is Matt Haberstrom.

539
00:32:25,616 --> 00:32:29,618
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm assuming Grace is going to explain this rubric to the school committee.

540
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:31,799
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I would like that.

541
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:36,922
[SPEAKER_24]: Since she created it and they can get a good handle on what the scoring is all about.

542
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:37,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

543
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:39,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Grace.

544
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,444
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to do that if that's what you would like, yes.

545
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:43,125
[SPEAKER_26]: Please.

546
00:32:44,425 --> 00:32:45,586
[SPEAKER_26]: OK, does this look fine to you?

547
00:32:46,517 --> 00:33:00,400
[SPEAKER_26]: A point of information on that last slide, the 66 names, we arrived at that 66 after actually removing some names using the process that we voted on.

548
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:11,342
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know that it needs to be articulated here, but there were some other names that did not make that list of 66, if that makes sense.

549
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:14,623
[SPEAKER_26]: So it was an additional step as part of our process.

550
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,331
[SPEAKER_21]: What did we take off?

551
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,933
[SPEAKER_21]: We took off the people who were still alive.

552
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:24,416
[SPEAKER_08]: And the ones that weren't entered in good faith, like Vito Corleone.

553
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:29,660
[SPEAKER_17]: So anyone have a problem with leaving at 66?

554
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:44,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe just a rewording, like after reviewing the community survey, we created a list of unique name suggestions, 66 suggestions based on that input or

555
00:33:46,182 --> 00:33:46,782
[SPEAKER_08]: something like that.

556
00:33:47,683 --> 00:33:48,563
[SPEAKER_26]: That sounds good.

557
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:52,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to acknowledge the survey because it was very important.

558
00:33:52,784 --> 00:33:56,126
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

559
00:33:56,406 --> 00:33:58,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I can't remember what it was so important that we ignore it.

560
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:01,488
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't ignore anything.

561
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:05,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I read every single through the every single entry, please.

562
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:08,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we correct that first line of that Senate?

563
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:10,291
[SPEAKER_17]: First bullet statement that

564
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:14,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I feel like there should be some mention that there was more than 66 names.

565
00:34:15,391 --> 00:34:16,332
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Matt again.

566
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:17,092
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

567
00:34:17,793 --> 00:34:18,813
[SPEAKER_24]: And that didn't we vote?

568
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:23,936
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I don't know if we want to put this in there, but didn't we vote to take off the living members of this list?

569
00:34:24,536 --> 00:34:24,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

570
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:25,457
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

571
00:34:25,957 --> 00:34:33,441
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if we want to mention that to let people know that that's one reason why that's one reason where a lot of them got knocked off.

572
00:34:35,582 --> 00:34:37,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to mention the survey that was done?

573
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:39,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's in a

574
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:42,803
[SPEAKER_17]: Next slide.

575
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,004
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the process step-by-step as we went through it.

576
00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:53,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can't remember what I said.

577
00:34:53,947 --> 00:35:03,791
[SPEAKER_26]: I think you said like after the committee reviewed the results of the community survey, we generated a list of 66 names.

578
00:35:05,612 --> 00:35:06,572
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. LaFleur, very good.

579
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:13,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

580
00:35:14,774 --> 00:35:18,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So do we want to put in more of the methodology with how we narrowed it?

581
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:28,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I think saying that we omitted living people is probably an important.

582
00:35:29,642 --> 00:35:30,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

583
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:34,944
[SPEAKER_21]: Couldn't the person who's doing this slide, put that in the notes and add it?

584
00:35:34,964 --> 00:35:36,765
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we can add it there.

585
00:35:37,732 --> 00:36:00,179
[SPEAKER_15]: Should I just put a... Just a clarification, in the notes already, it does say the first reduction of the list was to remove living, current living suggestions, and then the remain, like, it kind of walks through some of that.

586
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,921
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you want to open up the talking points,

587
00:36:06,841 --> 00:36:10,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so yeah, like it could be possibly in the script.

588
00:36:11,404 --> 00:36:13,225
[SPEAKER_15]: And then alter it as needed.

589
00:36:13,245 --> 00:36:17,568
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just kind of a way to help frame everything.

590
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:25,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I guess we'll have to go through that soon because the script could highlight different info than the slide.

591
00:36:29,675 --> 00:36:30,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, should I go to the next one?

592
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:33,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll work on that after?

593
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:41,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Or someone else could pop in and edit while I'm driving the slides.

594
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're good on the rubric, right?

595
00:36:50,622 --> 00:36:51,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody good on the rubric?

596
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:52,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

597
00:36:53,263 --> 00:36:53,383
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

598
00:37:09,866 --> 00:37:10,426
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Matt.

599
00:37:10,947 --> 00:37:18,752
[SPEAKER_24]: On this slide, should we name, should we put Dela Russa's name in there so people aren't wondering who was that name that was accidentally left off?

600
00:37:21,314 --> 00:37:27,259
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say no, because I think that takes out the neutrality.

601
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:31,822
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree.

602
00:37:32,663 --> 00:37:34,884
[SPEAKER_21]: And the committee is going to have the list of 18 anyway, won't they?

603
00:37:35,525 --> 00:37:35,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

604
00:37:42,131 --> 00:37:48,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of our proceedings are public documents and public records, so they have access to what happened.

605
00:37:50,815 --> 00:37:54,136
[SPEAKER_15]: They can also just ask, and we can tell them, too.

606
00:37:54,236 --> 00:38:01,119
[SPEAKER_15]: I think as long as whoever is presenting the slide knows that information, it's information that we can freely give them without hesitation.

607
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:05,161
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

608
00:38:05,581 --> 00:38:06,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Is everyone good with this slide?

609
00:38:08,322 --> 00:38:08,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

610
00:38:08,862 --> 00:38:09,162
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

611
00:38:09,763 --> 00:38:09,943
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

612
00:38:11,477 --> 00:38:11,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

613
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:14,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Mr. Chairman.

614
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:16,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have to go back and look at the last one?

615
00:38:16,439 --> 00:38:19,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Has the last one been fixed or are we gonna go back to it later?

616
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Too bad, that was being changed.

617
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:44,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think the question here is, do we want to change it on the slide or do we want to add it to the script?

618
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:51,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's always, it's pretty much standard that you put less info on the slide.

619
00:38:51,627 --> 00:38:54,169
[SPEAKER_08]: At least this is what I've heard in every single PowerPoint class I've taken.

620
00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:59,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Less info on the slide so that people's eyes aren't all over the place.

621
00:39:00,013 --> 00:39:06,418
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you put additional info in the narration or the script.

622
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,840
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, that's fine.

623
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:11,881
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll leave it like that.

624
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:13,001
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no preference.

625
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:14,362
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

626
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:16,682
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, can we go back?

627
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:18,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, where were we?

628
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:19,863
[SPEAKER_08]: We were good on this?

629
00:39:20,543 --> 00:39:20,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

630
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:31,126
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Chair, I'd like to speak on this slide, if I may.

631
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:36,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think we should have this slide.

632
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:38,436
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is misleading.

633
00:39:39,497 --> 00:39:43,000
[SPEAKER_11]: We were not tasked with counting votes, because these were not votes.

634
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:49,706
[SPEAKER_11]: We were tasked with reading every single submission, doing our own research and coming up with the rubric and that's what we did.

635
00:39:51,588 --> 00:40:01,890
[SPEAKER_11]: giving these numbers, I mean the numbers are public, they will be given to the school committee, any member of the public can access those numbers, they can access all of the numbers that we have.

636
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:07,151
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this slide makes it seem like it was an election, and it wasn't.

637
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:11,491
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I would say that this slide is misleading in itself.

638
00:40:13,232 --> 00:40:20,853
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information through the chair, as somebody who is sitting on this committee, strongly, strongly, strongly,

639
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:24,608
[SPEAKER_20]: advocating for community input and community feedback.

640
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:34,333
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it is extremely important that we let the community know how their feedback was taken and what they submitted and what was submitted.

641
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:37,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Somebody used the word mock.

642
00:40:39,135 --> 00:40:48,640
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said, if we are not gonna present the community with what they provided to us, this is extremely misleading.

643
00:40:49,457 --> 00:41:10,067
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of information to the chair, all of our information, including all of the things that we just voted on last week to send to this school committee, our public record, every single document that we've created, every single thing that we've done, every single rubric that each individual has taken, every single, uh,

644
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:15,640
[SPEAKER_03]: submission from the public, all of those are public documents.

645
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:28,145
[SPEAKER_20]: So then point of information to the chair, there's no reason why we can't summarize it here for the community who doesn't have time to go through a Google Doc drive that has thousands and thousands of documents.

646
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:30,646
[SPEAKER_20]: We were barely able to do that in the time that we were given.

647
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,867
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the time please.

648
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:46,869
[SPEAKER_20]: It's interesting, whenever I speak about community input and supporting and using the community, I get spoken over and I really find that to be alarming and I'm just really disgusted.

649
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:54,416
[SPEAKER_20]: So all I'm going to say is it is extremely important to me that we listen to the community and we let them know what we heard.

650
00:41:54,716 --> 00:41:57,458
[SPEAKER_20]: And what we heard on here, it doesn't say anything about votes.

651
00:41:58,419 --> 00:42:02,002
[SPEAKER_20]: All it says is the number of submissions that was received for each name.

652
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:07,411
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will continue to fight and continue to speak on behalf of the community.

653
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:09,953
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's what this slide means to me.

654
00:42:10,073 --> 00:42:10,553
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

655
00:42:10,574 --> 00:42:12,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Information to the chair.

656
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:13,416
[SPEAKER_21]: This is Kathy K. Yep.

657
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:19,501
[SPEAKER_21]: But I then think we would need to have all of the names with how many submissions there were like Lydia.

658
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,171
[SPEAKER_21]: Child, Marie Child, those names, none of those are on this slide.

659
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:26,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information to Mrs. Kaye through the chair.

660
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:30,836
[SPEAKER_20]: When I developed this slide, there was a next bullet that said, and so on.

661
00:42:30,856 --> 00:42:35,140
[SPEAKER_20]: I just didn't have time to go through and put every name.

662
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,581
[SPEAKER_20]: So I agree with Miss Kaye.

663
00:42:37,282 --> 00:42:39,664
[SPEAKER_20]: That line that I had in there was taken out.

664
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:41,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information.

665
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:42,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Rob.

666
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:43,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Ann, go ahead.

667
00:42:44,402 --> 00:42:45,202
[SPEAKER_02]: No, let Ron call.

668
00:42:45,242 --> 00:42:46,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go after Ron.

669
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,683
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks.

670
00:42:46,723 --> 00:42:47,283
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks, Dan.

671
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:50,885
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we've been going through this for four weeks now.

672
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:54,547
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand the frustration you heard from me at the beginning.

673
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:58,729
[SPEAKER_22]: However, this was never a vote, and it's been miscommunicated.

674
00:42:58,989 --> 00:42:59,629
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not a vote.

675
00:42:59,709 --> 00:43:08,513
[SPEAKER_22]: What I do suggest is there is significance in this number for the three people that we chose, Gene Barry Sutherland, Belinda Sutton, and Missituk.

676
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:11,575
[SPEAKER_22]: In my 14-page presentation, I wrote

677
00:43:13,002 --> 00:43:26,108
[SPEAKER_22]: This disclaimer, while this number does not have any significance in terms of a vote or total legitimate entries, it is important to note that this was a search for positive and negative antidotes and feedback on each candidate.

678
00:43:27,408 --> 00:43:42,835
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you wanna put percentage, I wouldn't even count, I'd put Jean Barry Sutherland got 34% of the feedback, but that disclaimer has to be there because we're just perpetuating this, what it's not, and it's not a vote, period.

679
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:46,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you, Ron.

680
00:43:46,484 --> 00:43:49,046
[SPEAKER_02]: For information, Jim, just want to make a quick comment.

681
00:43:49,607 --> 00:44:02,119
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're being true to the process and we're showing how we got where we got and this was part of the process, I think it's important that we keep that in there and let them know that this was part of the process.

682
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:03,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

683
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,803
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair, I'd like to make a motion to keep this slide.

684
00:44:07,484 --> 00:44:08,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I second that motion.

685
00:44:09,409 --> 00:44:11,411
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, further discussion here.

686
00:44:11,451 --> 00:44:13,092
[SPEAKER_17]: I see hands up and then we'll take a vote.

687
00:44:13,312 --> 00:44:14,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Laura, would you like to speak?

688
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:16,174
[SPEAKER_11]: I've already spoken, thank you.

689
00:44:17,976 --> 00:44:19,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth, do you got a hand up?

690
00:44:23,721 --> 00:44:24,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth, do I see a hand up?

691
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:25,802
[SPEAKER_03]: You do.

692
00:44:27,704 --> 00:44:33,308
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, are we specifically speaking to this motion that has now been made to keep this?

693
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,251
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a motion to accept this slide.

694
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,532
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

695
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:46,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we going to go through each particular thing on the presentation as a whole?

696
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:57,078
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'm a little unclear as to a parliamentary thing because are we, you know, I mean, there's other edits that we're going to be making.

697
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:00,038
[SPEAKER_03]: On this slide?

698
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:05,179
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I guess I'm just asking important information.

699
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,540
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are having a vote.

700
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:38,872
[SPEAKER_17]: individual slides so right now every up until now we've we've pretty much agreed on the slides now this slide we have a little disagreement we have a motion we'll see you know the vote we'll see who if the slide stays or goes all right um maybe i'll let patrick uh weigh in here if you would so choose because i think what we may be facing is that we have asked a subcommittee to bring this to us and

701
00:45:40,587 --> 00:45:58,436
[SPEAKER_03]: that might have some parliamentary issues from a standpoint as to whether or not we're going to then, as a committee, change what we had tasked the- We're going to take this forward as a committee, and that's, we tasked some committee to bring it to us so we could do this.

702
00:45:59,196 --> 00:45:59,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

703
00:45:59,736 --> 00:46:07,100
[SPEAKER_03]: So from my standpoint, I think that the information has already been passed through

704
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:19,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that presenting it here is misleading and doesn't serve a purpose.

705
00:46:21,032 --> 00:46:24,676
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would strongly recommend it being removed.

706
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:26,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

707
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:27,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick, you got any comment?

708
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:29,661
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, Mr. Chair.

709
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:38,942
[SPEAKER_23]: When we asked for input from the community, it was specifically stated that this was not a vote.

710
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:54,106
[SPEAKER_23]: In fact, when one of our committee members resigned, one of the issues that was brought forward was that he had stated something about this being a vote and multiple people took offense to saying it's a vote.

711
00:46:54,746 --> 00:46:56,427
[SPEAKER_23]: Now people are saying it is a vote.

712
00:46:57,251 --> 00:47:02,092
[SPEAKER_23]: It wasn't a vote before, now it is a vote, or now it's just stating what the submissions are.

713
00:47:02,112 --> 00:47:05,653
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't hear them say it's a vote, I heard them say it's submissions.

714
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:10,654
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, even if it's submissions, we didn't go through and we did not call the list.

715
00:47:11,294 --> 00:47:18,736
[SPEAKER_23]: I took a look at the list, there's people on here saying, in the survey we asked them what their relationship was to Medford.

716
00:47:19,396 --> 00:47:22,197
[SPEAKER_23]: Somebody there said my boyfriend lives in Fulton Heights.

717
00:47:22,777 --> 00:47:27,778
[SPEAKER_23]: Someone else said that they knew one of the candidates because they were in sewing club together.

718
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:31,659
[SPEAKER_23]: Multiple people said they're former residents of Medford.

719
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:43,821
[SPEAKER_23]: So we didn't go through and call this list to see whether or not this, you know, how many submissions were accurately represented as people of the Medford community.

720
00:47:43,841 --> 00:47:46,641
[SPEAKER_20]: A point of information to the chair.

721
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:50,742
[SPEAKER_20]: If we weren't going to allow, if we weren't going to accept certain submissions,

722
00:47:51,632 --> 00:47:56,955
[SPEAKER_20]: then it should have indicated that if you did not meet this criteria, then you could not provide feedback.

723
00:47:57,415 --> 00:48:03,258
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't start now eliminating feedback based on criteria that we're setting in the 11th hour.

724
00:48:03,658 --> 00:48:06,239
[SPEAKER_17]: No argument here, please.

725
00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:06,719
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

726
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Kathy Kaye, would you like to speak next?

727
00:48:11,107 --> 00:48:11,567
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, please.

728
00:48:12,128 --> 00:48:22,355
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I just need to reiterate that if in fact we're gonna have this slide, it should have all of the names with how many submissions they got, not just the first five or however many are there.

729
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:26,878
[SPEAKER_17]: If we want it to be- That would be an amendment.

730
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I would second that amendment, Kathy.

731
00:48:32,182 --> 00:48:32,442
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

732
00:48:34,864 --> 00:48:36,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Grace, would you like to speak?

733
00:48:36,918 --> 00:48:55,273
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I just, clarification, I think, I just wanted to go back to what Ron had stated about how he had, in his longer presentation, he had provided this information, but in a different way.

734
00:48:55,553 --> 00:49:00,998
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was wondering if that was an amendment to this.

735
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,281
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not quite sure where we stand procedurally, but,

736
00:49:08,169 --> 00:49:16,755
[SPEAKER_15]: if we're voting on this slide versus a suggestion that Ron had made to clarify some of the numbers that were on here.

737
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:23,740
[SPEAKER_17]: I have an amendment and I have a motion here.

738
00:49:24,721 --> 00:49:28,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron, was that an amendment or?

739
00:49:28,864 --> 00:49:36,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I mean, you know me in procedure, I'm always behind, but yeah, it's an amendment and here's the amendment.

740
00:49:37,189 --> 00:49:40,248
[SPEAKER_22]: The only information that's valid here are the three finalists.

741
00:49:41,127 --> 00:49:52,093
[SPEAKER_22]: I think instead of putting a number, I think a percentage, and I also think the disclaimer has to be on here that I just read, has to be on there, because that's what it was, seeking information.

742
00:49:52,393 --> 00:49:57,456
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think we forget that there were multiple people entering submissions multiple times.

743
00:49:58,116 --> 00:50:00,878
[SPEAKER_22]: I think there were multiple people just saying, I like this one.

744
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:07,302
[SPEAKER_22]: The goal of that whole effort was for people to submit positive and negative information.

745
00:50:08,662 --> 00:50:10,304
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I would offer an amendment.

746
00:50:10,404 --> 00:50:18,151
[SPEAKER_22]: I would support this slide if it said only the three names, the percentages, people can figure out how much was not what was the other.

747
00:50:18,872 --> 00:50:22,154
[SPEAKER_22]: And the disclaimer that I read that this was definitely not a vote.

748
00:50:23,055 --> 00:50:24,336
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, that's what we voted for.

749
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:27,598
[SPEAKER_22]: As much as I'd love to do it the other way, that's what we voted for.

750
00:50:27,678 --> 00:50:35,143
[SPEAKER_22]: And I also suggest that going forward to the next slide, people can offer friendly amendments, which has been the procedure for this committee since its beginning.

751
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:37,364
[SPEAKER_22]: You accept the amendment, we make the change.

752
00:50:37,444 --> 00:50:38,745
[SPEAKER_22]: These really are amendments.

753
00:50:38,845 --> 00:50:42,307
[SPEAKER_22]: This is not, we, subcommittee did not come up with a final presentation.

754
00:50:43,288 --> 00:50:45,229
[SPEAKER_22]: The whole committee will approve this one.

755
00:50:45,649 --> 00:50:48,891
[SPEAKER_22]: So friendly amendments, and then if it gets stuck, we have to vote.

756
00:50:49,251 --> 00:50:50,032
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the process.

757
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,621
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, thank you.

758
00:50:52,801 --> 00:50:53,661
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have an amendment.

759
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:57,463
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, we have an amendment to add all the names to this list.

760
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:00,464
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to vote that up or down.

761
00:51:01,945 --> 00:51:03,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Kristen has her hand up.

762
00:51:04,366 --> 00:51:11,490
[SPEAKER_08]: As do I. Sorry, I've lost the little hand thingy because I'm screen sharing.

763
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,950
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know where it went.

764
00:51:14,231 --> 00:51:17,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say, I don't know why we started.

765
00:51:19,762 --> 00:51:29,967
[SPEAKER_08]: arguing, well, maybe not arguing on this one, but we didn't even address the comments that were there from the subcommittee where Grace just wanted to, her comment is, can we move the slide up to slide eight?

766
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,488
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to know if that made sense.

767
00:51:32,288 --> 00:51:37,291
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Maria brought up in the comments, should the other 13 be included or top five?

768
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:48,637
[SPEAKER_08]: So in the subcommittee, I don't even think we were talking about removing it, but maybe we should address the comments that we had

769
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,369
[SPEAKER_08]: earlier before we, I have no problem with leaving it.

770
00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:12,739
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think in Turan's case, this would be a place where we could use the script for the presentation to be more detailed about how the process went and yeah, give some of the background that he suggested.

771
00:52:12,759 --> 00:52:15,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

772
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,021
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth?

773
00:52:19,307 --> 00:52:34,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I just wanted to reiterate that from a standpoint of how this committee was given its charter, it's our job to come up with the three names.

774
00:52:35,134 --> 00:52:40,357
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, community feedback and the submissions were a part of that.

775
00:52:41,217 --> 00:52:45,779
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, when we have done our job,

776
00:52:49,472 --> 00:53:07,300
[SPEAKER_03]: they are no longer the part of the, they are no longer the part of our job that necessarily needs to have representation in form of this that looks like a vote.

777
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:14,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it just gives the wrong impression that, you know,

778
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:20,433
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't give the clearest picture of what our job was.

779
00:53:20,993 --> 00:53:24,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's the most important part.

780
00:53:25,355 --> 00:53:38,359
[SPEAKER_03]: For a presentation that is supposed to say, these are the three names, this is how we determined our names, that's what the presentation's for.

781
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:45,762
[SPEAKER_03]: This is specifically the- The question is whether we're leaving the slide or taking it out.

782
00:53:47,249 --> 00:53:47,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

783
00:53:47,651 --> 00:53:48,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the community slide.

784
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:50,022
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the committee slide.

785
00:53:50,344 --> 00:53:51,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my point.

786
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, point of information again, this is part of the process.

787
00:53:55,221 --> 00:53:58,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just confused as to why we're even discussing it.

788
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,602
[SPEAKER_02]: It was part of the process that we got community feedback.

789
00:54:01,702 --> 00:54:05,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we gonna eliminate the community feedback portion?

790
00:54:05,203 --> 00:54:05,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

791
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:11,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like there was a lot of votes for Gene Barry and a lot less for the other two that are going forward.

792
00:54:11,464 --> 00:54:12,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

793
00:54:12,484 --> 00:54:14,664
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it was part of the process.

794
00:54:14,724 --> 00:54:17,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Community feedback was part of what we did.

795
00:54:18,185 --> 00:54:27,092
[SPEAKER_02]: So to eliminate this, I think we're doing a big injustice to the whole process and to the folks that took their time to do it.

796
00:54:27,172 --> 00:54:39,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the 423 people submitted for Gene Barry and whatever percentage of them doubled or faked it or whatever, this was what we got and this is what we're showing you we got.

797
00:54:41,303 --> 00:54:44,865
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just don't understand why we're still kind of discussing this.

798
00:54:44,945 --> 00:54:46,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's part of the process.

799
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:48,026
[SPEAKER_02]: We're showing them the process.

800
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we move on?

801
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:51,928
[SPEAKER_02]: You call the move the vote.

802
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:55,149
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we should.

803
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:58,510
[SPEAKER_24]: There are still a lot of hands up for discussion, Jim.

804
00:54:58,931 --> 00:54:59,271
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

805
00:55:08,635 --> 00:55:09,115
[SPEAKER_23]: Patrick.

806
00:55:11,459 --> 00:55:21,324
[SPEAKER_23]: My concern with this slide is it sends a message that there was a vote and that this committee did not take it to consider.

807
00:55:22,124 --> 00:55:22,464
[SPEAKER_17]: What's that?

808
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:23,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't use the word vote.

809
00:55:23,805 --> 00:55:24,545
[SPEAKER_17]: It's submissions.

810
00:55:25,006 --> 00:55:25,866
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I know that.

811
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:26,826
[SPEAKER_17]: But what just happened.

812
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:34,380
[SPEAKER_23]: When Danny just spoke, as he used the word vote, people are going to use the word vote.

813
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,741
[SPEAKER_23]: I wish they wouldn't, but they are.

814
00:55:37,402 --> 00:55:39,824
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what this slide is gonna be perceived as.

815
00:55:40,524 --> 00:55:47,129
[SPEAKER_23]: And when Melissa gave her presentation, she said she was gonna pick the three people that received the most votes.

816
00:55:48,189 --> 00:55:54,734
[SPEAKER_23]: If we check the notes, despite the fact that the motion specifically states that these are not votes,

817
00:55:57,378 --> 00:55:58,979
[SPEAKER_23]: It's gonna be perceived as a vote.

818
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:02,160
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is going out into the community perceived as a vote.

819
00:56:02,781 --> 00:56:04,942
[SPEAKER_23]: And some people in the community didn't think of it.

820
00:56:05,102 --> 00:56:13,585
[SPEAKER_23]: Most people didn't think of it as a vote, but now it's gonna be presented as such and be held against either this committee or the school committee.

821
00:56:14,246 --> 00:56:15,947
[SPEAKER_02]: And that- Jim, put up information, Jim.

822
00:56:16,407 --> 00:56:16,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

823
00:56:18,314 --> 00:56:19,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's all be realistic here.

824
00:56:20,555 --> 00:56:28,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not think for one second, the school committee, who is gonna be voting on this, doesn't know about this list, whether you call it submissions, votes, whatever it is.

825
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,201
[SPEAKER_02]: The school committee is aware of this list, and I don't care what anybody tells me.

826
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:40,325
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us to take it out when it was part of our process, you can even eliminate the names.

827
00:56:40,485 --> 00:56:45,267
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just showing them what we did as part of our process, and this is what came back.

828
00:56:46,767 --> 00:56:48,448
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so I would agree with that.

829
00:56:48,508 --> 00:56:52,331
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, let's not talk about this one all night, stop.

830
00:56:52,432 --> 00:57:02,599
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, if you looked back at slide seven, it does detail the steps that we took in order to receive public participation.

831
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:09,605
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see that there were 17 names, we put out a survey, it was translated, members could submit.

832
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:12,251
[SPEAKER_15]: there was a limit to what they could say.

833
00:57:12,431 --> 00:57:17,453
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did receive over 1,200 online responses and 39 paper responses.

834
00:57:17,753 --> 00:57:24,316
[SPEAKER_15]: So the only thing that this slide doesn't detail right now is the list of names and how those got broken down.

835
00:57:24,516 --> 00:57:32,580
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's a little disingenuous to state that we're not stating how we got community input when this in fact,

836
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,903
[SPEAKER_15]: does already discuss the process as to what we did to get the community feedback.

837
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:51,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Additionally, later on, when you get to the specific names, there are comments that have been pulled from the community input in order to support some of the specific names.

838
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:56,172
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's incorporated throughout this presentation, I think in various ways.

839
00:57:58,895 --> 00:58:09,064
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still there, whether it's as explicit as the slide, it's not, but I think it's been incorporated in this and in other ways.

840
00:58:10,486 --> 00:58:10,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

841
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:15,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Melissa, your hand up.

842
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,281
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, point of information through the chair.

843
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:25,609
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason that I added this slide, I don't care if we put submissions, I don't care if we put tally marks, I don't care if we say lollipops were submitted for these people.

844
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:34,516
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's crucial that we ask the community for input and the results of their input and their time should be presented to the community.

845
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:41,843
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with, I think it was Ron who said, put a disclaimer, these are not votes, they were not utilized as votes.

846
00:58:42,508 --> 00:58:53,335
[SPEAKER_20]: And yes, Patrick, last week I did say that my role here is to listen to the community and I will listen to them and I will support the names that came in with the three highest submissions.

847
00:58:53,415 --> 00:58:54,415
[SPEAKER_20]: So you are correct.

848
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:56,237
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not going by votes.

849
00:58:56,777 --> 00:59:06,423
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going based on the feedback and the number of people who spent their time to commit to this process in a democratic way and they want their voices to be heard.

850
00:59:07,724 --> 00:59:11,006
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think it was a gross failure on the part of the school committee

851
00:59:11,778 --> 00:59:16,780
[SPEAKER_20]: if it was to task us with this with no public engagement.

852
00:59:20,782 --> 00:59:24,064
[SPEAKER_20]: And so I would like that to be on the record that I don't care if these are votes.

853
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:26,204
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care if these are handed out lollipops.

854
00:59:26,245 --> 00:59:27,245
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care what they are.

855
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:28,466
[SPEAKER_20]: These are voices.

856
00:59:28,526 --> 00:59:38,450
[SPEAKER_20]: We can say 423 voices were heard, but it's crucial that we ask for community input and the community sees what we heard.

857
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

858
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:42,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

859
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:45,460
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

860
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,661
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see any more hands.

861
00:59:46,822 --> 00:59:47,543
[SPEAKER_17]: We're all set here.

862
00:59:48,144 --> 00:59:50,648
[SPEAKER_10]: I leave myself.

863
00:59:50,808 --> 00:59:51,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

864
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:01,883
[SPEAKER_21]: If I'm just going to jump in, just because.

865
01:00:02,343 --> 01:00:02,824
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that okay?

866
01:00:03,204 --> 01:00:03,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

867
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:11,413
[SPEAKER_21]: I was just wondering if it might make everybody feel better that rather than say number of submissions and like Melissa was saying, it doesn't matter if it says lollipop.

868
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:15,077
[SPEAKER_21]: So maybe we just say number of feedback forms collected.

869
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,942
[SPEAKER_21]: If that makes people feel better about this.

870
01:00:23,778 --> 01:00:28,320
[SPEAKER_26]: And I was just going to say that, you know, there are a lot of slides in this presentation.

871
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:35,724
[SPEAKER_26]: And while I may not be delivering the presentation, ultimately, we may need to reduce the number of slides.

872
01:00:36,164 --> 01:00:44,028
[SPEAKER_26]: And so I think having a list of all the names and all the submissions that basically replicates the data set that we're turning over to the school committee

873
01:00:44,688 --> 01:00:46,269
[SPEAKER_26]: might be overkill in this case.

874
01:00:46,569 --> 01:00:49,050
[SPEAKER_26]: I do agree we should have some community feedback.

875
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:54,253
[SPEAKER_26]: I think Dr. Grace suggested that maybe that is actually the public participation slide.

876
01:00:54,733 --> 01:01:10,041
[SPEAKER_26]: If we want to have this slide, perhaps Ron's suggestion of just some percentages with our three names, but I think adding a whole list, the entire list with all the submissions is an extra slide and you're not going to have much time in the presentation to spend on that detail.

877
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:13,463
[SPEAKER_26]: And we're already handing over that data to the school committee.

878
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:15,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask how many slides in total?

879
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:19,789
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Lisa.

880
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:20,589
[SPEAKER_17]: 25, I think.

881
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:25,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I think some of these at the bottom are extra.

882
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:25,870
23.

883
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:32,511
[SPEAKER_15]: 23, and then the ones at the bottom are just recovered slides.

884
01:01:33,091 --> 01:01:36,012
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be worked back in.

885
01:01:37,152 --> 01:01:42,193
[SPEAKER_14]: So between 20 and 25, so you're thinking about a 25 minute presentation approximately?

886
01:01:43,847 --> 01:01:45,650
[SPEAKER_26]: Probably closer to two minutes per slide.

887
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:55,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're gonna have to get clarification from the superintendent, because I think that my beach time.

888
01:01:55,985 --> 01:01:57,087
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not sure.

889
01:01:59,456 --> 01:02:04,099
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not positive, but I believe that you're going to have to get clarification.

890
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:10,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think anyone's made that long of a presentation in front of the committee, but again, the superintendent's office would have to clarify that.

891
01:02:10,945 --> 01:02:15,428
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's too long because it's a regular meeting, so there's other things on the agenda.

892
01:02:17,801 --> 01:02:32,526
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to touch base with Dr. Cushing and he'll probably jump in at some point to kind of, I think they will look in between five and 10 minutes, but again, I can't be quoted because I'm not the rule maker, but I do know 25 minutes could be wrong.

893
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:40,209
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll try to get Dr. Cushing in the meantime for clarification, but I just want to throw it out there folks, sorry.

894
01:02:40,749 --> 01:02:42,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm always the bearer of bad news.

895
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:46,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I make a comment on the community feedback slide?

896
01:02:48,725 --> 01:02:51,366
[SPEAKER_08]: What if we just added the, I have no problem with the slide.

897
01:02:52,167 --> 01:03:12,217
[SPEAKER_08]: What if we just added the context in case people forget the number and just say close to 1,300 members of the Medford community decided to share feedback out of that and then just give them the starting number and then the submission numbers make more sense in context.

898
01:03:14,445 --> 01:03:18,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no other issue with this slide, unless of course, as Lisa said, it comes down to time.

899
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:20,567
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information.

900
01:03:20,587 --> 01:03:21,907
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, right.

901
01:03:22,027 --> 01:03:31,950
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the side comment that Dr. Grace is the correct one, we can list these numbers and then a description of the process already includes 1,200 plus submissions.

902
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:40,953
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we give this, maybe tweak a little bit the disclaimer part of it with this next slide, as opposed to the before slide.

903
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:42,814
[SPEAKER_22]: And again,

904
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:51,926
[SPEAKER_22]: just while I have the five minutes for this presentation, I might as well just fold it in an envelope and hand it over.

905
01:03:51,946 --> 01:03:56,607
[SPEAKER_22]: 25 minutes is the minimum we're gonna use.

906
01:03:58,108 --> 01:04:00,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Just five minutes is ridiculous.

907
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:04,650
[SPEAKER_22]: But anyway, switching that slide to number eight makes more sense to me.

908
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:11,313
[SPEAKER_22]: That way, Dr. Grace can add the disclaimer again, or it's already there.

909
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:13,736
[SPEAKER_22]: We move on, everything's done.

910
01:04:14,036 --> 01:04:22,261
[SPEAKER_22]: Whether you want, to me, three names, percentage, is, you know, Jean Barry Sutherland got 34% of the feedback.

911
01:04:23,502 --> 01:04:26,104
[SPEAKER_22]: Belinda Sutton got 12% of the feedback.

912
01:04:26,424 --> 01:04:28,305
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Tuck got 12% of the feedback.

913
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:29,166
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's go.

914
01:04:29,786 --> 01:04:31,167
[SPEAKER_22]: We haven't even got to substance yet.

915
01:04:31,787 --> 01:04:32,808
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with Melissa.

916
01:04:33,328 --> 01:04:34,629
[SPEAKER_17]: This is important information.

917
01:04:34,789 --> 01:04:40,413
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we take back the, rescind the amendment and the motion and go with Ron's?

918
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:45,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I've had my hand raised for quite a while.

919
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:46,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I speak.

920
01:04:47,025 --> 01:04:47,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

921
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:48,665
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

922
01:04:49,006 --> 01:04:51,607
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to reiterate what's been said.

923
01:04:52,127 --> 01:04:54,629
[SPEAKER_10]: This information will be public record.

924
01:04:54,689 --> 01:04:57,190
[SPEAKER_10]: The school committee will already have access to it.

925
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,251
[SPEAKER_10]: The public will already have access to it.

926
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:02,673
[SPEAKER_10]: To be quite honest, it feels like a

927
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:32,510
[SPEAKER_10]: logical fallacy to be providing these numbers, but because regardless of whether you say, okay, yes, this was not a vote, this was simply feedback, I don't think that you can really qualify submissions that said nothing but N-A or completely blank or people ranting about why the Columbus school name should not be changed anyways in these numbers.

928
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:46,653
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that that is an accurate representation of the community's feedback regardless, especially considering the fact that this is a very limited scope of the people in the community.

929
01:05:46,673 --> 01:05:54,059
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel as though, regardless of whether we have the slide or not, the school committee is going to see this information.

930
01:05:54,864 --> 01:06:12,649
[SPEAKER_10]: So it feels like if we're presenting this to the public, if that is the point of this, if that is the point of this presentation, in addition to presenting to the school committee, it just simply feels like a logical fallacy.

931
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:14,090
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels unnecessary.

932
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:22,192
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels like it's going to be misleading regardless of whether we have that caveat that this was not a vote or not.

933
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,041
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information through the chair.

934
01:06:25,101 --> 01:06:31,724
[SPEAKER_20]: First of all, I find it extremely disrespectful to say that people who do not want the name of the Columbus change to be ranting.

935
01:06:32,564 --> 01:06:34,025
[SPEAKER_20]: So I wanna put that on the record.

936
01:06:34,945 --> 01:06:40,188
[SPEAKER_20]: And second, if this information is gonna be in black and white in front of the school committee, that's fabulous.

937
01:06:40,248 --> 01:06:48,492
[SPEAKER_20]: But again, gonna back my stance that this is, we are gonna have the public watching that and they're not gonna have the packet that the school committee is going to have in front of them.

938
01:06:49,132 --> 01:06:50,713
[SPEAKER_20]: This information is crucial.

939
01:06:52,087 --> 01:06:52,927
[SPEAKER_20]: to be shared.

940
01:06:53,508 --> 01:07:01,091
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, many people on this committee seem to not understand the importance of community input, and it's very, very alarming to me.

941
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:13,155
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't understand why there's such a hesitation to provide information, but not 423 voices were heard, good, bad, or indifferent for these names.

942
01:07:14,676 --> 01:07:17,497
[SPEAKER_20]: The community deserves to be heard.

943
01:07:17,517 --> 01:07:20,118
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like I'm talking to a wall.

944
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:23,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Lisa, have you got your hand up?

945
01:07:27,632 --> 01:07:29,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, can we move this to the vote?

946
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:30,974
[SPEAKER_02]: You call the vote.

947
01:07:30,994 --> 01:07:32,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I shouldn't have it up.

948
01:07:33,436 --> 01:07:33,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

949
01:07:35,378 --> 01:07:36,759
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

950
01:07:37,379 --> 01:07:39,561
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Brie, I've had my hand up for quite a while now.

951
01:07:40,161 --> 01:07:41,242
[SPEAKER_17]: He called the vote, Brie.

952
01:07:41,782 --> 01:07:43,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, what is the vote to keep it?

953
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:45,305
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I'd like to know, what are we voting on?

954
01:07:45,685 --> 01:07:48,427
[SPEAKER_17]: To keep it, yes, to keep it, no, it's out.

955
01:07:49,015 --> 01:07:49,655
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of order.

956
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:52,937
[SPEAKER_23]: Before we take a vote, we would have to vote two-thirds.

957
01:07:53,598 --> 01:07:57,340
[SPEAKER_23]: Calling the vote requires a vote of two-thirds to close debate.

958
01:07:59,581 --> 01:08:00,381
[SPEAKER_17]: He called the vote.

959
01:08:00,902 --> 01:08:01,142
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

960
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,023
[SPEAKER_23]: That requires a vote of two-thirds.

961
01:08:04,104 --> 01:08:05,044
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not debatable.

962
01:08:05,144 --> 01:08:11,828
[SPEAKER_23]: So we need to take a vote first on whether or not we call the vote, whether or not we close debate.

963
01:08:17,175 --> 01:08:21,857
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, debate is still open, and people need to be recognized to talk.

964
01:08:23,997 --> 01:08:25,258
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we've had enough discussion.

965
01:08:25,278 --> 01:08:26,218
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to go to the vote.

966
01:08:27,258 --> 01:08:28,999
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I ask a clarifying question, Jim?

967
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:29,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

968
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:32,040
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not according to the Robert rules.

969
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,940
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a point of order.

970
01:08:34,321 --> 01:08:34,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead, Kathy.

971
01:08:35,641 --> 01:08:40,403
[SPEAKER_21]: Are these five questions the one that got the top five submission responses?

972
01:08:41,403 --> 01:08:43,304
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that why these five are there specifically?

973
01:08:45,424 --> 01:08:46,325
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe so.

974
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:46,845
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

975
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:48,920
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

976
01:08:51,182 --> 01:08:52,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, on the motion, Brie.

977
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:56,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Ken, I just have some clarification.

978
01:08:56,685 --> 01:08:57,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm so sorry.

979
01:08:57,405 --> 01:09:06,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we voting on the slide as is, or are we voting on the slide with Ron's suggestions?

980
01:09:07,251 --> 01:09:13,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just like to have a formal understanding of what exactly about this slide I'm voting on, yes or no.

981
01:09:13,354 --> 01:09:18,017
[SPEAKER_17]: To get to Ron's suggestion, we need to vote this down and go to Ron's suggestion, I would say.

982
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:19,920
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that was a friendly amendment.

983
01:09:20,761 --> 01:09:21,481
[SPEAKER_17]: Was it actually?

984
01:09:21,941 --> 01:09:24,021
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an amendment to this slide.

985
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:31,123
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just want to reiterate to Melissa, this is an opportunity for us to keep this information on.

986
01:09:31,163 --> 01:09:32,563
[SPEAKER_22]: I cannot support it this way.

987
01:09:33,143 --> 01:09:35,324
[SPEAKER_22]: I do believe moving it to the eighth slide.

988
01:09:35,484 --> 01:09:40,725
[SPEAKER_22]: And then once again, this is our opportunity to educate the public.

989
01:09:41,425 --> 01:09:48,187
[SPEAKER_22]: And the fact is we appreciate the community input was invaluable because I didn't know any of these candidates.

990
01:09:48,932 --> 01:09:53,378
[SPEAKER_22]: However, it was never a vote, and I think it's our opportunity to say that, that's all.

991
01:09:56,321 --> 01:09:57,663
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise, I just don't see the slide.

992
01:09:58,604 --> 01:10:02,990
[SPEAKER_22]: Your choices are to sweeten it or eliminate it, in my opinion, so.

993
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:21,776
[SPEAKER_20]: point of information through the chair I just want everybody to know that I was also under the impression that we were kind of drafting these slides, I felt that this information was important to share, and my kind of draft of the slide was just I would like to discuss this information and how it should be presented in no way shape or form at any point did I feel that my

994
01:10:22,296 --> 01:10:25,219
[SPEAKER_20]: slide and the information that I provided was set in stone.

995
01:10:25,559 --> 01:10:36,650
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I said, we can change it to voices, we can change it to whatever we want to change it, but the point of my slide was to get something down and my passion behind listening to and respecting the people of Medford.

996
01:10:36,991 --> 01:10:40,494
[SPEAKER_20]: However we want to present it, you wanted to move it to number eight, that doesn't matter to me.

997
01:10:41,555 --> 01:10:45,980
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care where we present it or how we present it, it was more just, can we please work off of this?

998
01:10:47,174 --> 01:10:55,577
[SPEAKER_20]: and value my strong belief that the community needs to be heard regardless of if it's, thank you for taking your time to fill out a Google poll.

999
01:10:56,897 --> 01:10:59,818
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's, I will not change my stance on this.

1000
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:00,658
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1001
01:11:00,678 --> 01:11:03,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, Melissa, I agree with what you're saying.

1002
01:11:03,919 --> 01:11:08,801
[SPEAKER_22]: I just think it needs to be done in a way that we reiterate, it wasn't a vote.

1003
01:11:09,321 --> 01:11:11,241
[SPEAKER_22]: It was extremely valuable information.

1004
01:11:11,261 --> 01:11:13,502
[SPEAKER_22]: It was an education and that's what it was meant to be.

1005
01:11:14,045 --> 01:11:17,206
[SPEAKER_22]: opinions of way to vote go right to the school committee.

1006
01:11:17,466 --> 01:11:18,106
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not us.

1007
01:11:18,547 --> 01:11:21,568
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think information, Ron, I'm agreeing with you.

1008
01:11:21,608 --> 01:11:22,708
[SPEAKER_20]: I know that you agree with me.

1009
01:11:22,888 --> 01:11:25,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we do that to this slide right now?

1010
01:11:25,269 --> 01:11:26,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's just move forward.

1011
01:11:26,409 --> 01:11:26,629
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1012
01:11:26,869 --> 01:11:27,490
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1013
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, slide what you're saying.

1014
01:11:32,091 --> 01:11:32,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1015
01:11:33,132 --> 01:11:34,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chair.

1016
01:11:34,032 --> 01:11:38,453
[SPEAKER_17]: So who's got the power to change the wording?

1017
01:11:38,794 --> 01:11:41,855
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just drag like I would in PowerPoint on the left?

1018
01:11:41,995 --> 01:11:42,795
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to break anything.

1019
01:11:44,075 --> 01:11:44,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1020
01:11:44,335 --> 01:11:45,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, you can drag.

1021
01:11:45,156 --> 01:11:45,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1022
01:11:46,337 --> 01:11:46,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1023
01:11:46,777 --> 01:11:47,858
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1024
01:11:47,978 --> 01:11:50,320
[SPEAKER_08]: And then do we want to add any any wording?

1025
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Ron had some nice suggestions before.

1026
01:11:53,262 --> 01:11:55,804
[SPEAKER_24]: Can we can we see the slide before?

1027
01:11:55,824 --> 01:11:57,785
[SPEAKER_24]: So I understand the public.

1028
01:11:57,805 --> 01:11:59,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I think I'm on it now.

1029
01:11:59,126 --> 01:12:01,408
[SPEAKER_08]: It should say community feedback at the top.

1030
01:12:01,468 --> 01:12:02,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you seeing my screen?

1031
01:12:02,449 --> 01:12:05,051
[SPEAKER_24]: I think you mean slide seven.

1032
01:12:05,471 --> 01:12:06,412
[SPEAKER_24]: Slide seven.

1033
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:06,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1034
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:10,935
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a line about participation that maybe could just be expanded.

1035
01:12:11,836 --> 01:12:12,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm hmm.

1036
01:12:13,017 --> 01:12:20,682
[SPEAKER_08]: I also like keeping the slide because it just occurred to me maybe if someone sees that, maybe we'll get more people participating in this type of thing in the future.

1037
01:12:20,702 --> 01:12:26,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to get more feedback on any similar situations we find ourselves in.

1038
01:12:28,646 --> 01:12:32,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So I agree with Melissa that it would be good to keep it there so that people know that their voices are heard.

1039
01:12:34,179 --> 01:12:46,591
[SPEAKER_21]: But I do think too, I'm sorry to belabor the point, for all those people who voted for the names that aren't the top five, then maybe it should say, these five names had the most feedback or something like that.

1040
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:49,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Because all the other names that are on the list, people wrote about them.

1041
01:12:49,894 --> 01:12:55,360
[SPEAKER_21]: And so for those people, they're not seeing, well, where's the name I voted, submitted on, not voted.

1042
01:12:56,450 --> 01:13:07,832
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, so do we add saying that there's 500 other votes or however many other votes there were that weren't counted from those other 13 nominees?

1043
01:13:08,312 --> 01:13:13,573
[SPEAKER_22]: Just point of information, that is why I only wanted the three of our finalists there with a percentage.

1044
01:13:14,073 --> 01:13:16,313
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can figure out there were other votes there.

1045
01:13:17,233 --> 01:13:26,015
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanna make it simple but concise that this is valuable, we appreciate this input 100%, but it just, it wasn't a vote.

1046
01:13:26,968 --> 01:13:37,414
[SPEAKER_24]: point of information, Mr. Lister, I don't see why we don't list the names without the submission numbers and or the top 18 that we were discussing.

1047
01:13:37,474 --> 01:13:39,335
[SPEAKER_24]: Here are the top 18 that we discussed.

1048
01:13:41,036 --> 01:13:42,757
[SPEAKER_24]: Why do we need the submission numbers?

1049
01:13:43,737 --> 01:13:49,901
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, I feel strongly that we do not put this in as a submission because it does look like votes.

1050
01:13:50,341 --> 01:13:53,943
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of our committee members are saying the word vote, and I find it really

1051
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:56,610
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, awful to hear that all the time.

1052
01:13:57,231 --> 01:13:59,971
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's some confusion over submissions and votes.

1053
01:14:05,273 --> 01:14:08,694
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to move past this page and we're going to stick on this page for the rest of the night.

1054
01:14:10,234 --> 01:14:12,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, from a point of order, are we actually

1055
01:14:14,226 --> 01:14:17,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept it into it or not?

1056
01:14:17,971 --> 01:14:20,093
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a motion on the floor to accept it into it.

1057
01:14:20,253 --> 01:14:21,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1058
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:26,441
[SPEAKER_22]: Is a friendly is a friendly amendment offered that has not been accepted yet.

1059
01:14:28,123 --> 01:14:29,024
[SPEAKER_22]: That's our procedure.

1060
01:14:29,584 --> 01:14:31,407
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so to Melissa.

1061
01:14:32,728 --> 01:14:44,811
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm asking you to accept the amendment that only the three finalist names and the percentage of submissions are listed along with the disclaimer, either in slide seven or slide eight.

1062
01:14:46,371 --> 01:14:46,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you?

1063
01:14:47,472 --> 01:14:49,192
[SPEAKER_20]: Ron, I accept your friendly amendment.

1064
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:51,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1065
01:14:52,833 --> 01:14:53,553
[SPEAKER_22]: That's how it works.

1066
01:14:53,593 --> 01:14:55,634
[SPEAKER_22]: That's our process, been since day one.

1067
01:14:56,654 --> 01:15:00,855
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, but right now- Now you can vote on it, up or down.

1068
01:15:02,355 --> 01:15:04,917
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I think there was another amendment on the floor from Matt Haverstead.

1069
01:15:04,937 --> 01:15:08,901
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to second that amendment to put the top 18 names.

1070
01:15:08,961 --> 01:15:15,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it makes sense that the other names are missing, to put just the 18 names and not the number of submissions.

1071
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:21,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I would second that amendment.

1072
01:15:21,491 --> 01:15:22,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chair, I'm against that.

1073
01:15:22,752 --> 01:15:26,836
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, that wasn't a friendly amendment, the second one.

1074
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,317
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll vote that amendment first.

1075
01:15:30,344 --> 01:15:31,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there any more discussion here?

1076
01:15:31,725 --> 01:15:33,247
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of clarification, please.

1077
01:15:33,287 --> 01:15:44,977
[SPEAKER_20]: Can I ask Laura what if we're summarizing the community feedback and somebody please explain to me that just listing the 18 names that doesn't really provide any context of why.

1078
01:15:46,212 --> 01:15:50,797
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't really would see the point of just listing 18 names so if somebody could just keep clarify that for me.

1079
01:15:51,598 --> 01:16:02,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Before I vote, I can address that I think, as Kathy case that it makes sense that you know we're leaving out in the 1412 names here that people did put a lot of heart and soul into.

1080
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:11,256
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think having the numbers of submissions, as I've said before, gives the wrong sense that these have some sort of weight.

1081
01:16:11,376 --> 01:16:15,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Perhaps there was one submission in a name in the top 18 that really spoke to us.

1082
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,762
[SPEAKER_11]: We were not given a quantitative task.

1083
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:28,029
[SPEAKER_11]: We were given a qualitative task to use our best judgment to read all of the feedback from everybody and make our decision based on a rubric.

1084
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:31,172
[SPEAKER_11]: We were not tasked with counting numbers of submissions.

1085
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:34,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I have said it, but I will just say it again.

1086
01:16:34,034 --> 01:16:38,437
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is misleading to the public to rank by the number of submissions.

1087
01:16:38,497 --> 01:16:41,159
[SPEAKER_11]: And instead I would like to see the full 18 be there.

1088
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,661
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information.

1089
01:16:44,402 --> 01:16:49,926
[SPEAKER_20]: It was then misleading to ask the public to submit information if we were going to not even consider it.

1090
01:16:49,946 --> 01:16:52,728
[SPEAKER_20]: So we can get on to the next slide.

1091
01:16:58,718 --> 01:17:06,165
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of order, Mr. Chair, the amendment that needs to be voted on is the amendment of the 18 names, not the amendment.

1092
01:17:06,345 --> 01:17:06,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

1093
01:17:08,087 --> 01:17:09,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Can I have that vote now?

1094
01:17:09,288 --> 01:17:11,810
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody else?

1095
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:14,773
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there a second on adding all 18 names?

1096
01:17:15,714 --> 01:17:16,034
[SPEAKER_23]: Three.

1097
01:17:16,314 --> 01:17:17,716
[SPEAKER_11]: And without the submission number.

1098
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:20,589
[SPEAKER_17]: How do you vote on this?

1099
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,192
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you're all talking over each other.

1100
01:17:23,212 --> 01:17:25,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no idea what's being voted on.

1101
01:17:25,414 --> 01:17:27,095
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many amendments flying around.

1102
01:17:27,736 --> 01:17:30,018
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had my hand up since the start of the meeting.

1103
01:17:30,618 --> 01:17:33,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I don't know what we're voting on.

1104
01:17:34,782 --> 01:17:39,867
[SPEAKER_17]: This was an amendment to list all 18 names with the submissions next to them.

1105
01:17:41,955 --> 01:17:43,936
[SPEAKER_11]: point of order, without the submission numbers next to that.

1106
01:17:44,157 --> 01:17:44,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, without the submission.

1107
01:17:44,937 --> 01:17:45,778
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how I understood it.

1108
01:17:45,798 --> 01:17:48,700
[SPEAKER_04]: With the submissions, with the submissions was the agreement.

1109
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:51,582
[SPEAKER_11]: The amendment from Matt Haberstow, maybe he could clarify.

1110
01:17:52,062 --> 01:17:54,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there was a motion before Matt's.

1111
01:17:55,444 --> 01:17:57,005
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, there was a motion before Matt's.

1112
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:00,348
[SPEAKER_24]: I simply, you know, somebody can help me with procedure.

1113
01:18:00,528 --> 01:18:06,392
[SPEAKER_24]: I would just suggesting we list all 18, top 18, without the numbers, because the numbers

1114
01:18:08,064 --> 01:18:11,626
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, they make you interpret it as voting.

1115
01:18:12,026 --> 01:18:18,708
[SPEAKER_24]: And as Mr. McCabe said, a lot of these submissions weren't verifiable, okay?

1116
01:18:19,188 --> 01:18:23,270
[SPEAKER_24]: So putting all these numbers up there makes it look like a winner and a loser.

1117
01:18:23,850 --> 01:18:24,650
[SPEAKER_24]: And we don't wanna do that.

1118
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:25,330
[SPEAKER_24]: We wanna put all 18.

1119
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,491
[SPEAKER_24]: These are the ones we discussed.

1120
01:18:27,591 --> 01:18:30,112
[SPEAKER_24]: In other words, number of submissions provided by the community, 1,200, 1,300.

1121
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:31,812
[SPEAKER_24]: And these are the top 13 we discussed.

1122
01:18:35,705 --> 01:18:40,406
[SPEAKER_02]: So information, Jim runs, runs friendly amendment was percentages, right?

1123
01:18:41,006 --> 01:18:41,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1124
01:18:41,966 --> 01:18:42,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1125
01:18:42,326 --> 01:18:43,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So we vote on that.

1126
01:18:43,926 --> 01:18:45,047
[SPEAKER_17]: So we got to vote first.

1127
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:50,088
[SPEAKER_17]: We got to vote mats down or up before we get to Ron's.

1128
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:51,088
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1129
01:18:51,848 --> 01:18:54,268
[SPEAKER_22]: My end doesn't need a vote if she, if Melissa accepts it.

1130
01:18:54,308 --> 01:18:55,489
[SPEAKER_22]: So we need to do this one first.

1131
01:18:55,529 --> 01:18:55,729
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

1132
01:18:55,809 --> 01:18:56,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we go right to Melissa.

1133
01:18:58,149 --> 01:18:58,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1134
01:18:59,429 --> 01:19:01,730
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is to list all 18 with no

1135
01:19:04,385 --> 01:19:05,806
[SPEAKER_17]: number of submissions next to them.

1136
01:19:07,187 --> 01:19:19,858
[SPEAKER_03]: But if clarification, would a yes vote here, then are we going to actually be voting for whether or not we include the slide as a whole?

1137
01:19:20,478 --> 01:19:27,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens with a yes vote or with a no vote to this particular amendment?

1138
01:19:29,445 --> 01:19:33,709
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is to add it to the slide if we include the slide in the next vote.

1139
01:19:35,642 --> 01:19:40,066
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Chair.

1140
01:19:40,246 --> 01:19:46,452
[SPEAKER_23]: Mr. Chair, the question, though, is if we include the 18 names, that's the only thing on this slide.

1141
01:19:46,872 --> 01:19:51,717
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the only thing on the amendment, is do we include the 18 names?

1142
01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:53,338
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

1143
01:19:54,539 --> 01:19:59,784
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we say we include the 18 names, then the original motion is moved.

1144
01:20:04,403 --> 01:20:04,643
[SPEAKER_23]: Right?

1145
01:20:04,943 --> 01:20:06,544
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, there's nothing else on the slide.

1146
01:20:06,604 --> 01:20:09,064
[SPEAKER_23]: If there were more things on the slide, I would understand.

1147
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:19,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Wouldn't the motion be to accept to keep this slide as amended, if that motion passes?

1148
01:20:21,308 --> 01:20:25,250
[SPEAKER_24]: That was my idea, to keep this slide, but eliminate the numbers and put all 18.

1149
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:31,592
[SPEAKER_08]: What if we just reiterate in the introduction, out of the nearly 1,300

1150
01:20:33,138 --> 01:20:58,733
[SPEAKER_08]: community submissions that we received on 18 candidates are the five that went forward, or I don't wanna say, the five that had the highest rubric score were, that way we're giving context, we're giving information, we are acknowledging people that were, you know,

1151
01:20:59,987 --> 01:21:03,410
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, listed, but not, we can't, don't have room to list everybody here.

1152
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:12,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're just, and then letting the community know there are more names that we don't have room to list here, but we heard you and read every single one of them.

1153
01:21:13,379 --> 01:21:13,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

1154
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:18,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information, I don't think the rubric scores accurately represent what was submitted by the community.

1155
01:21:18,644 --> 01:21:23,949
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of procedure, please, to Patrick through the chair.

1156
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:25,691
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Ron.

1157
01:21:26,210 --> 01:21:38,839
[SPEAKER_22]: Patrick, if the first amendment, which was mine, is accepted by the author as a friendly amendment, how does it not become the amendment that we vote on for this slide?

1158
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:46,105
[SPEAKER_23]: Because the amendment to the friendly amendment is what needs to be voted on first.

1159
01:21:46,185 --> 01:21:50,088
[SPEAKER_23]: Any amendment to a motion needs to be voted on before the motion itself.

1160
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:55,692
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an amendment to the motion, right?

1161
01:21:56,734 --> 01:21:57,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1162
01:21:59,095 --> 01:22:02,975
[SPEAKER_17]: So if the amendment doesn't pass, then we go to Ron, we go to the other.

1163
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:03,736
[SPEAKER_23]: Correct.

1164
01:22:03,936 --> 01:22:11,277
[SPEAKER_23]: But if the amendment does pass, I believe that that means that this slide is 18 names with no submissions.

1165
01:22:14,038 --> 01:22:17,819
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information too, once we add this amendment, then you can vote up or down.

1166
01:22:18,439 --> 01:22:20,580
[SPEAKER_22]: So got a lot of work still to go on this.

1167
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:21,740
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

1168
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,920
[SPEAKER_22]: Move the amendment please.

1169
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now it's the amendment.

1170
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:31,834
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now I am voting on this slide to have 18 names on it with no numbers.

1171
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:33,475
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1172
01:22:34,596 --> 01:22:34,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1173
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:35,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1174
01:22:37,958 --> 01:22:38,358
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan.

1175
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:41,381
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1176
01:22:43,982 --> 01:22:44,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Aaron.

1177
01:22:44,343 --> 01:22:45,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Aaron's not here.

1178
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:46,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Beth's not here.

1179
01:22:46,224 --> 01:22:47,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Aaron.

1180
01:22:47,165 --> 01:22:47,725
[SPEAKER_17]: Aaron is here.

1181
01:22:47,805 --> 01:22:49,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron is here.

1182
01:22:50,027 --> 01:22:50,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1183
01:22:50,727 --> 01:22:51,028
[SPEAKER_17]: Aaron.

1184
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:54,290
[SPEAKER_23]: He's muted.

1185
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,821
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not a host, she can't unmute.

1186
01:22:57,081 --> 01:23:00,444
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you do a physical thumbs up for yes and thumbs down for no?

1187
01:23:03,826 --> 01:23:04,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?

1188
01:23:05,067 --> 01:23:07,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're muted now.

1189
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you very much.

1190
01:23:12,211 --> 01:23:17,635
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to vote to include all 18 names without numbers, please.

1191
01:23:19,376 --> 01:23:19,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1192
01:23:21,558 --> 01:23:23,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Beth Fuller, she's not here, right?

1193
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Grace Caldera?

1194
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:30,061
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1195
01:23:32,581 --> 01:23:33,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Ken Mallon?

1196
01:23:34,261 --> 01:23:34,542
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1197
01:23:36,662 --> 01:23:37,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Kristen Scalise?

1198
01:23:38,382 --> 01:23:38,622
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1199
01:23:40,743 --> 01:23:41,743
[SPEAKER_17]: Laura Rotolo?

1200
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:42,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1201
01:23:44,404 --> 01:23:45,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Leila Fleur?

1202
01:23:46,404 --> 01:23:46,644
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1203
01:23:50,665 --> 01:23:51,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Luwin Thapa?

1204
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:52,205
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1205
01:23:53,865 --> 01:23:54,726
[SPEAKER_17]: Maria Rocha?

1206
01:23:56,146 --> 01:23:56,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1207
01:23:58,558 --> 01:23:59,098
[SPEAKER_17]: Melissa?

1208
01:24:00,539 --> 01:24:00,859
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1209
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:03,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick McCabe?

1210
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:04,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1211
01:24:06,421 --> 01:24:07,301
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul Donato?

1212
01:24:07,862 --> 01:24:08,182
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1213
01:24:09,662 --> 01:24:10,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron Givino?

1214
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:11,363
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1215
01:24:12,543 --> 01:24:13,124
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth Hill?

1216
01:24:15,324 --> 01:24:15,564
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1217
01:24:17,185 --> 01:24:17,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Kathy Kaye?

1218
01:24:18,866 --> 01:24:19,146
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1219
01:24:20,766 --> 01:24:21,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt Habistro?

1220
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:22,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1221
01:24:24,648 --> 01:24:26,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Did Caitlin Shaughnessy show up?

1222
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:27,329
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1223
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:29,370
[SPEAKER_17]: I haven't seen her.

1224
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:31,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Janelle Garland McKenzie.

1225
01:24:32,092 --> 01:24:32,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1226
01:24:35,493 --> 01:24:36,433
[SPEAKER_17]: Josie DeFore.

1227
01:24:37,294 --> 01:24:37,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1228
01:24:39,435 --> 01:24:40,515
[SPEAKER_17]: And the chair votes no.

1229
01:24:40,855 --> 01:24:41,416
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have.

1230
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:50,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1231
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,621
[SPEAKER_17]: So 11 yes, nine nos.

1232
01:24:55,282 --> 01:24:57,463
[SPEAKER_17]: So all 18 submissions will be there.

1233
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:02,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1234
01:25:03,868 --> 01:25:05,849
[SPEAKER_22]: Now are we moving the slide to slide eight?

1235
01:25:06,289 --> 01:25:08,990
[SPEAKER_22]: No, that was just the amendment to the slide.

1236
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:10,450
[SPEAKER_22]: We have not approved the slide yet.

1237
01:25:11,091 --> 01:25:11,391
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1238
01:25:13,592 --> 01:25:15,032
[SPEAKER_08]: We already did move it to slide eight.

1239
01:25:16,233 --> 01:25:18,333
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be moved again.

1240
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:19,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1241
01:25:20,334 --> 01:25:21,915
[SPEAKER_17]: And now are we leaving the slide in?

1242
01:25:25,156 --> 01:25:25,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1243
01:25:25,936 --> 01:25:27,377
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the motion we're voting on.

1244
01:25:29,795 --> 01:25:32,016
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe that's what was just voted on, Mr. Chair.

1245
01:25:32,997 --> 01:25:33,858
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the amendment.

1246
01:25:34,318 --> 01:25:35,719
[SPEAKER_22]: An amendment to that slide.

1247
01:25:35,999 --> 01:25:36,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1248
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:41,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, didn't Ron have an amendment to put it up there with percentages?

1249
01:25:42,163 --> 01:25:45,345
[SPEAKER_22]: My amendment is moot now because we voted on this amendment.

1250
01:25:45,425 --> 01:25:50,648
[SPEAKER_22]: All we can do is vote down the slide and vote on a new motion to a new slide.

1251
01:25:50,949 --> 01:25:51,809
[SPEAKER_22]: That's our only option.

1252
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:53,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ron.

1253
01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:57,092
[SPEAKER_21]: And may I ask a question to the chair?

1254
01:25:57,593 --> 01:25:57,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1255
01:25:58,539 --> 01:25:59,179
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess through Ron.

1256
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:04,221
[SPEAKER_21]: So for voting on this slide, is it as is or what we just voted on to amend it with?

1257
01:26:04,321 --> 01:26:09,704
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'm certainly not the expert, but it's been amended to just the 18 names here.

1258
01:26:09,784 --> 01:26:11,064
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know where it's positioned.

1259
01:26:12,745 --> 01:26:13,125
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

1260
01:26:13,205 --> 01:26:15,466
[SPEAKER_22]: We just voted to put 18 names on this slide.

1261
01:26:15,766 --> 01:26:15,966
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1262
01:26:15,986 --> 01:26:17,067
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's what we're voting on now.

1263
01:26:17,487 --> 01:26:18,187
[SPEAKER_22]: That's correct.

1264
01:26:18,407 --> 01:26:18,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1265
01:26:18,867 --> 01:26:20,128
[SPEAKER_22]: And Patrick is the expert.

1266
01:26:20,168 --> 01:26:24,750
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just a slide in to leave the slide in that says,

1267
01:26:25,438 --> 01:26:27,819
[SPEAKER_22]: the all 18 names, no submissions.

1268
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:34,863
[SPEAKER_22]: I assume you all mean under where it says number of submissions provided by the community that didn't get changed.

1269
01:26:35,263 --> 01:26:36,444
[SPEAKER_24]: That's correct, Ron.

1270
01:26:36,464 --> 01:26:37,505
[SPEAKER_24]: That makes the most sense.

1271
01:26:37,705 --> 01:26:40,846
[SPEAKER_24]: All 18 names, no submissions under that next slide.

1272
01:26:41,767 --> 01:26:42,807
[SPEAKER_24]: Are we voting?

1273
01:26:42,868 --> 01:26:48,711
[SPEAKER_22]: My point is that all we did was, what does the slide look like with this amendment?

1274
01:26:48,911 --> 01:26:53,513
[SPEAKER_22]: Is the number of submissions provided by the community on the public engagement form, does that stay?

1275
01:26:53,533 --> 01:26:54,754
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I don't remember voting on that.

1276
01:26:56,221 --> 01:27:04,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Or is it just a slide that says the 18 names?

1277
01:27:05,209 --> 01:27:07,911
[SPEAKER_24]: Somebody can wordsmith that fairly easily.

1278
01:27:07,931 --> 01:27:09,452
[SPEAKER_24]: That's on the subcommittee, I would imagine.

1279
01:27:12,035 --> 01:27:15,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Kristen who was making the changes as we spoke?

1280
01:27:16,018 --> 01:27:18,060
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody can just pop in and do that right now, right?

1281
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:20,522
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, let's move on the slide up or down.

1282
01:27:22,167 --> 01:27:27,131
[SPEAKER_24]: So all this discussion could be- We have to vote on the up or down on this slide.

1283
01:27:27,671 --> 01:27:29,292
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, point of order, Mr. Chair.

1284
01:27:29,452 --> 01:27:31,213
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe that we just voted on that.

1285
01:27:31,754 --> 01:27:36,157
[SPEAKER_23]: The amendment was to replace all of the language that was in the original motion.

1286
01:27:36,177 --> 01:27:50,747
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, we could vote again whether or not we include the slide, but I mean, I think that by virtue of us voting on the slide content, we're voting on having the slide in the presentation.

1287
01:27:55,598 --> 01:28:15,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, my understanding was is that we were gonna vote on Matt's and then we were gonna vote on Jim's, I'm sorry, on Ron's that had the percentages, you know, and keep at the bottom three, but now there's not gonna be any percentages.

1288
01:28:15,203 --> 01:28:18,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And like Ron said, his, you know,

1289
01:28:22,312 --> 01:28:23,133
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just useless.

1290
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any, what we just did to me makes zero sense because we voted on one thing thinking that there was gonna be another vote on another thing and it never happened.

1291
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:41,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're gonna have a slide with 18 names on it with no percentages.

1292
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:49,587
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that's absolutely useless because it's not showing the true, you know, the true thing that the public was able to participate in.

1293
01:28:50,207 --> 01:28:51,548
[SPEAKER_02]: We're basically leaving that out.

1294
01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:53,538
[SPEAKER_02]: just doesn't make sense.

1295
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:55,479
[SPEAKER_21]: Point of information?

1296
01:28:56,479 --> 01:28:58,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Isn't that information on the slide that comes prior?

1297
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:00,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not.

1298
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,721
[SPEAKER_02]: We eliminated that slide now, apparently.

1299
01:29:03,641 --> 01:29:03,881
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

1300
01:29:05,181 --> 01:29:06,282
[SPEAKER_21]: Slide number seven, I mean.

1301
01:29:11,443 --> 01:29:15,664
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess to Danny's point is, what is the purpose of these 18?

1302
01:29:16,844 --> 01:29:19,445
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise, the previous slide works fine,

1303
01:29:19,973 --> 01:29:24,194
[SPEAKER_22]: We've already, you know, we keep talking about everything's open to the public.

1304
01:29:25,034 --> 01:29:26,115
[SPEAKER_22]: People know who the 18 are.

1305
01:29:26,175 --> 01:29:29,236
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know what the point of this slide would be as a speaker presenting.

1306
01:29:29,256 --> 01:29:31,176
[SPEAKER_17]: The point now would be whether to keep the slide or not.

1307
01:29:31,236 --> 01:29:33,237
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, I don't see the way it is now.

1308
01:29:33,297 --> 01:29:35,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's vote it.

1309
01:29:35,257 --> 01:29:35,798
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's vote it.

1310
01:29:35,838 --> 01:29:36,518
[SPEAKER_22]: That's how we do it.

1311
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:38,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Information through the chair, Mr. Lister?

1312
01:29:38,638 --> 01:29:38,979
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead.

1313
01:29:39,519 --> 01:29:39,859
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1314
01:29:40,059 --> 01:29:41,699
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Matt Haberstroh, just so you guys know.

1315
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:43,740
[SPEAKER_24]: The point of this slide

1316
01:29:45,468 --> 01:29:51,972
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not to slant the numbers that were thought of as votes, which people on this committee actually refer to as votes.

1317
01:29:53,092 --> 01:30:02,537
[SPEAKER_24]: So for the community, which I'm a part of, and I feel strongly about representing all those voices in Medford, that now they can see all 18 of these.

1318
01:30:02,557 --> 01:30:05,119
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope I'm not being mocked.

1319
01:30:06,097 --> 01:30:11,860
[SPEAKER_24]: I am just saying that this is the slide that shows you all the information that the community put in.

1320
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:14,622
[SPEAKER_24]: And I see that as not a problem.

1321
01:30:15,262 --> 01:30:18,584
[SPEAKER_24]: I see it as a focus rather than a rating system.

1322
01:30:18,785 --> 01:30:19,645
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's the point of it.

1323
01:30:19,965 --> 01:30:23,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Jim, I find that we're not being transparent with the community.

1324
01:30:24,488 --> 01:30:25,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very wrong.

1325
01:30:25,949 --> 01:30:29,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a disservice to the folks that did submit for any name.

1326
01:30:30,013 --> 01:30:37,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a discussion needs to be had and something needs to be shown, whether on another slide, with percentages from the community.

1327
01:30:38,441 --> 01:30:41,304
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always talking about transparency and inclusiveness.

1328
01:30:41,584 --> 01:30:48,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's include the folks that took their time to vote for anybody and show some sort of percentage of what folks did vote for.

1329
01:30:49,432 --> 01:30:50,112
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's the point.

1330
01:30:50,133 --> 01:30:52,235
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of slides to go through here.

1331
01:30:53,038 --> 01:30:53,919
[SPEAKER_21]: But they weren't voting.

1332
01:30:53,959 --> 01:30:54,760
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's the point.

1333
01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:56,222
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's the point we're trying to make here.

1334
01:30:57,064 --> 01:30:57,925
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's submissions.

1335
01:30:57,985 --> 01:30:58,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Call it whatever you want.

1336
01:30:58,866 --> 01:30:59,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it votes.

1337
01:30:59,767 --> 01:31:00,749
[SPEAKER_02]: You call it submissions.

1338
01:31:01,129 --> 01:31:02,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it down as submissions.

1339
01:31:02,451 --> 01:31:03,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I could care less what it is.

1340
01:31:03,953 --> 01:31:09,741
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the sake of transparency, the folks that went out there and voted.

1341
01:31:10,402 --> 01:31:12,484
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks that went in there and submitted.

1342
01:31:12,604 --> 01:31:13,725
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to use the word submitted?

1343
01:31:13,745 --> 01:31:14,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use the word submitted.

1344
01:31:15,146 --> 01:31:17,468
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks that went in there and submitted took their time.

1345
01:31:17,908 --> 01:31:22,792
[SPEAKER_02]: We should show transparency and show what those numbers are.

1346
01:31:22,972 --> 01:31:23,833
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my feeling.

1347
01:31:24,598 --> 01:31:25,838
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of order, Mr. Lister.

1348
01:31:26,299 --> 01:31:26,579
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1349
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:29,099
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is transparency, Danny.

1350
01:31:29,159 --> 01:31:31,520
[SPEAKER_24]: These are all the names that the community put feedback in.

1351
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:32,861
[SPEAKER_24]: This is transparency.

1352
01:31:33,101 --> 01:31:34,001
[SPEAKER_24]: It is transparency.

1353
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:36,082
[SPEAKER_24]: Why don't we put some numbers next to all those names?

1354
01:31:36,502 --> 01:31:40,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the numbers were never the point of this feedback.

1355
01:31:41,243 --> 01:31:57,349
[SPEAKER_24]: Somebody went through all the feedback and made some assumptions about ratings and things of that nature, which construes in a wrong way what the community feedback really is.

1356
01:31:58,729 --> 01:31:59,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel that way.

1357
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel that way personally.

1358
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:03,551
[SPEAKER_24]: I know you don't feel that way personally.

1359
01:32:07,947 --> 01:32:11,249
[SPEAKER_17]: get a couple more hands raised and then we can vote this slide in or out.

1360
01:32:11,549 --> 01:32:14,812
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, hold on.

1361
01:32:19,195 --> 01:32:20,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Maria, would you like to say something?

1362
01:32:22,017 --> 01:32:33,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we quite literally just took a vote to include the top 18 names without numbers and that was voted yes.

1363
01:32:35,172 --> 01:32:37,474
[SPEAKER_17]: to vote, put the top 18 in the slide.

1364
01:32:37,514 --> 01:32:40,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Now let's vote on whether to put the slide or not.

1365
01:32:41,596 --> 01:32:48,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and I just don't understand why there's this discussion about something that has already been voted down.

1366
01:32:50,342 --> 01:32:53,104
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of order, Mr. Chair, if I may answer that question.

1367
01:32:53,224 --> 01:32:59,248
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's an original motion on the floor to have a slide about community and feedback.

1368
01:32:59,928 --> 01:33:02,469
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there was a debate about what that slide should look like.

1369
01:33:02,569 --> 01:33:10,412
[SPEAKER_23]: So now the question is, do we include a slide about community feedback, which would be the 18 names with no submissions?

1370
01:33:10,553 --> 01:33:11,193
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the vote.

1371
01:33:11,233 --> 01:33:13,934
[SPEAKER_23]: That's why it's two different pieces of a vote.

1372
01:33:18,816 --> 01:33:24,438
[SPEAKER_23]: The vote right now is whether or not to include this slide that people are looking at right now as part of the presentation.

1373
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:25,199
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

1374
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:27,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Any more discussion?

1375
01:33:29,858 --> 01:33:30,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. Chair.

1376
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:36,504
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the point of showing the 18 names if it doesn't show what the community input was?

1377
01:33:38,526 --> 01:33:42,170
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that there was 18 names because that's what the community voted on.

1378
01:33:44,602 --> 01:33:45,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Submitted, submitted.

1379
01:33:45,903 --> 01:33:48,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I apologize.

1380
01:33:48,426 --> 01:33:49,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Submitted, submitted.

1381
01:33:49,827 --> 01:33:52,049
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're gonna- Submissions.

1382
01:33:52,349 --> 01:33:57,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we should put it, instead of alphabetically, put it in with the number of submissions, put it in that order.

1383
01:33:57,274 --> 01:33:58,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Would we agree for that?

1384
01:33:59,736 --> 01:34:03,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Agree with the order that the amount of submissions were made.

1385
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:07,884
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know the order of the submissions with the 18 names.

1386
01:34:10,232 --> 01:34:10,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone?

1387
01:34:10,552 --> 01:34:11,852
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1388
01:34:11,993 --> 01:34:14,113
[SPEAKER_17]: We've already voted.

1389
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:15,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Put it in like this.

1390
01:34:15,814 --> 01:34:17,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we going to put this slide in?

1391
01:34:17,374 --> 01:34:18,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes or no?

1392
01:34:19,715 --> 01:34:21,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Can I go down and take a roll call?

1393
01:34:25,796 --> 01:34:27,257
[SPEAKER_17]: Brie, are we putting the slide in?

1394
01:34:27,957 --> 01:34:28,177
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1395
01:34:36,419 --> 01:34:37,860
[SPEAKER_17]: Ian, are we putting the slide in?

1396
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:38,460
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1397
01:34:43,108 --> 01:34:44,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Erin, are we putting the slide in?

1398
01:34:49,792 --> 01:34:50,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Erin?

1399
01:34:54,616 --> 01:34:55,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we need it, no.

1400
01:34:58,598 --> 01:34:58,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Grace?

1401
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:02,501
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1402
01:35:04,642 --> 01:35:05,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Ken Mallon?

1403
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:06,523
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1404
01:35:07,924 --> 01:35:08,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Kristen Scalise?

1405
01:35:09,685 --> 01:35:09,885
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1406
01:35:11,246 --> 01:35:12,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Laura Rotolo?

1407
01:35:12,798 --> 01:35:13,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1408
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:16,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Lila Fleur.

1409
01:35:18,681 --> 01:35:19,001
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1410
01:35:20,842 --> 01:35:21,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Luwin Tapa.

1411
01:35:22,143 --> 01:35:22,443
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1412
01:35:24,084 --> 01:35:25,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Maria Mrosha.

1413
01:35:26,245 --> 01:35:26,505
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1414
01:35:26,525 --> 01:35:29,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Melissa Miguel.

1415
01:35:30,507 --> 01:35:34,270
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be disingenuous to include this slide, so I strongly vote no.

1416
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:37,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick McCabe.

1417
01:35:38,472 --> 01:35:38,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1418
01:35:42,138 --> 01:35:43,018
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul Donato?

1419
01:35:43,599 --> 01:35:43,879
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1420
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron Gervino?

1421
01:35:48,061 --> 01:35:48,301
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1422
01:35:50,142 --> 01:35:50,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth Hill?

1423
01:35:52,643 --> 01:35:52,843
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1424
01:35:54,524 --> 01:35:55,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Kathy Kaye?

1425
01:35:56,224 --> 01:35:56,444
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1426
01:35:58,285 --> 01:35:59,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt Havestro?

1427
01:36:00,006 --> 01:36:00,306
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1428
01:36:06,909 --> 01:36:09,190
[SPEAKER_17]: Janelle McCallum-McKenzie?

1429
01:36:10,251 --> 01:36:10,311
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1430
01:36:12,688 --> 01:36:13,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Josie DeFore?

1431
01:36:13,628 --> 01:36:13,669
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1432
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:17,691
[SPEAKER_17]: And Jim Lister, no.

1433
01:36:18,011 --> 01:36:18,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1434
01:36:18,491 --> 01:36:22,093
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have three yeses and the rest noes.

1435
01:36:22,173 --> 01:36:24,134
[SPEAKER_17]: So that slides out.

1436
01:36:24,174 --> 01:36:25,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we move to the next slide?

1437
01:36:35,459 --> 01:36:37,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that used to be the previous slide.

1438
01:36:37,981 --> 01:36:38,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's the next slide.

1439
01:36:39,942 --> 01:36:40,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we done with this one?

1440
01:36:45,395 --> 01:36:47,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this one needs to be adjusted now, right?

1441
01:36:48,856 --> 01:36:49,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably.

1442
01:36:49,316 --> 01:37:00,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if we just specify a little more, we received community submissions.

1443
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:04,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And from that, we took 18 names.

1444
01:37:08,363 --> 01:37:14,505
[SPEAKER_26]: And maybe after reviewing community feedback, all 18 names are individually scored by all committee members.

1445
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:24,024
[SPEAKER_21]: And is it, I'm sorry, may I ask a point of information question, Mr. Chair?

1446
01:37:24,865 --> 01:37:25,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.

1447
01:37:25,645 --> 01:37:29,347
[SPEAKER_21]: Do we have on any of these slides how many submissions we received altogether?

1448
01:37:29,367 --> 01:37:35,030
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe back there was one that said over 1200 submissions.

1449
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:35,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1450
01:37:35,570 --> 01:37:45,316
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you should take a look at slide seven.

1451
01:37:45,436 --> 01:37:47,237
[SPEAKER_22]: I think a lot of this is covered in that slide.

1452
01:37:49,178 --> 01:37:49,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1453
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:56,332
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, let's, do we need to change anything here or are we all right with this one?

1454
01:37:57,292 --> 01:37:59,372
[SPEAKER_17]: This is just procedure we went through.

1455
01:38:00,493 --> 01:38:03,113
[SPEAKER_23]: To Ron's point, can we look at slide seven?

1456
01:38:03,494 --> 01:38:05,814
[SPEAKER_23]: It seems like there may be a lot of duplication.

1457
01:38:09,575 --> 01:38:10,335
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I guess not.

1458
01:38:17,437 --> 01:38:19,378
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this one is how we asked for.

1459
01:38:20,353 --> 01:38:27,936
[SPEAKER_08]: the public participation and then the next slide is what we, how we parsed it.

1460
01:38:29,357 --> 01:38:33,339
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just referring to the amount of, I was just referring to the amount of submissions.

1461
01:38:33,879 --> 01:38:34,099
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1462
01:38:34,959 --> 01:38:40,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Slide seven says 17 names and then this one says- Oh, good point.

1463
01:38:43,523 --> 01:38:46,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, we said 17 plus one name that was accidentally left off.

1464
01:38:46,984 --> 01:38:47,744
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right, sorry.

1465
01:38:53,588 --> 01:38:54,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Is everybody okay with this slide?

1466
01:38:54,949 --> 01:38:59,151
[SPEAKER_08]: I think maybe in the first bullet, we could add in something.

1467
01:39:00,771 --> 01:39:03,253
[SPEAKER_08]: A short-term memory shot.

1468
01:39:03,533 --> 01:39:12,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe what Ron had talked about for the last slide, maybe some of his wording could be more clear here or make this more clear.

1469
01:39:12,397 --> 01:39:18,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Our community, sorry.

1470
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:22,562
[SPEAKER_24]: I eliminated the last slide of the, so.

1471
01:39:27,016 --> 01:39:29,458
[SPEAKER_08]: when we were talking about adding to the community feedback slide.

1472
01:39:32,621 --> 01:39:34,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there like a sentence that would make this more?

1473
01:39:34,642 --> 01:39:40,147
[SPEAKER_22]: I burnt it 30 minutes ago.

1474
01:39:42,388 --> 01:39:48,533
[SPEAKER_08]: All 18 names gleaned or synonym for gleaned, gleaned from public participation.

1475
01:39:48,553 --> 01:39:55,339
[SPEAKER_22]: I would motion that Dr. Grace accept these words as a friendly amendment just to

1476
01:39:55,913 --> 01:39:58,355
[SPEAKER_22]: enhance our appreciation of community involvement?

1477
01:40:00,137 --> 01:40:22,276
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a little, probably yes, but I'm just a little confused about what we're trying to accomplish with the addition because I'm also looking at what was written in the proposed script to try and add context to that.

1478
01:40:24,023 --> 01:40:33,030
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now it says the top 18 names were also independently researched and scored via the previously discussed rubric by all 23 advisory committee members.

1479
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:35,671
[SPEAKER_15]: The scores were collected, averaged and ranked.

1480
01:40:36,232 --> 01:40:43,017
[SPEAKER_15]: The committee then moved forward to reduce the list down using the final three adopted process.

1481
01:40:43,637 --> 01:40:52,984
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought at some point it said, yeah, there's a line in it saying that

1482
01:40:54,303 --> 01:40:59,726
[SPEAKER_15]: As a committee, we all took into account our own research, the rubric, and public input.

1483
01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:12,255
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if... So I guess clarification to the friendly amendment as to what exactly we're putting in the top with all the 18, and then let's go from there.

1484
01:41:15,697 --> 01:41:16,958
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you asking me this question?

1485
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:22,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoever proposed it, yes.

1486
01:41:25,470 --> 01:41:36,895
[SPEAKER_22]: I see the value, and based on what Melissa and everybody else has contributed, I do believe it's our opportunity to make a statement of how invaluable the community input was.

1487
01:41:36,955 --> 01:41:43,158
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think you can do that with two things, straightening out this vote versus submission thing in this sentence.

1488
01:41:46,039 --> 01:41:54,003
[SPEAKER_22]: While this number, whatever you want to say, while the submissions were not significant in any way as a vote,

1489
01:41:54,522 --> 01:41:57,984
[SPEAKER_22]: the total entries received was invaluable.

1490
01:41:58,004 --> 01:42:00,165
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know, I gotta rewrite it.

1491
01:42:01,285 --> 01:42:04,507
[SPEAKER_22]: Was invaluable to the committee for both positive and negative feedback.

1492
01:42:05,348 --> 01:42:06,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely, yes.

1493
01:42:07,229 --> 01:42:08,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that clarification.

1494
01:42:08,529 --> 01:42:09,370
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, yeah.

1495
01:42:09,830 --> 01:42:15,273
[SPEAKER_08]: How about did not signify a vote instead of saying we're not significant, because we don't want it to sound demeaning.

1496
01:42:15,293 --> 01:42:16,794
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

1497
01:42:16,814 --> 01:42:17,594
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know what you meant.

1498
01:42:17,654 --> 01:42:19,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally know that you did not mean it in any way.

1499
01:42:19,955 --> 01:42:21,136
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, thank you.

1500
01:42:21,736 --> 01:42:22,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you wanna?

1501
01:42:22,617 --> 01:42:23,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Can someone else?

1502
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:26,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, let me just add it here.

1503
01:42:27,451 --> 01:42:27,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Say it again.

1504
01:42:28,111 --> 01:42:30,431
[SPEAKER_22]: You're going to ask me to say it again.

1505
01:42:30,451 --> 01:42:32,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I thought you were writing it down.

1506
01:42:32,932 --> 01:42:45,815
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's just say the committee notes that the community input, although not a vote, was invaluable and important.

1507
01:42:46,955 --> 01:42:57,843
[SPEAKER_22]: to this decision process to receive both positive and most positive anecdote, most positive feedback and positive and negative feedback.

1508
01:42:58,944 --> 01:42:59,764
[SPEAKER_22]: It was invaluable.

1509
01:43:00,305 --> 01:43:02,046
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me think about it and write it again.

1510
01:43:05,168 --> 01:43:10,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Was invaluable and important as to both positive and negative feedback.

1511
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:24,183
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, say the committee wishes, I believe everybody's saying this, the committee wishes to note that the community feedback was an invaluable, it was a very valuable piece of our decision process.

1512
01:43:24,843 --> 01:43:29,826
[SPEAKER_22]: The ability to receive both positive and negative anecdotes and feedback.

1513
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:34,269
[SPEAKER_08]: It was an invaluable, important part of our

1514
01:43:34,776 --> 01:43:36,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you say the word deliberation?

1515
01:43:36,637 --> 01:43:37,297
[SPEAKER_22]: There you go.

1516
01:43:37,417 --> 01:43:38,018
[SPEAKER_22]: You can do that.

1517
01:43:38,038 --> 01:43:38,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Deliberations.

1518
01:43:38,978 --> 01:43:39,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

1519
01:43:39,758 --> 01:43:41,019
[SPEAKER_22]: There's so many.

1520
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:43,000
[SPEAKER_22]: English is not my thing.

1521
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,181
[SPEAKER_22]: I can add it up after, but not speaking.

1522
01:43:45,621 --> 01:43:51,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, because someone was saying percentages before, and I was like, do not let me do anywhere near math.

1523
01:43:52,504 --> 01:43:53,045
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Matt.

1524
01:43:53,125 --> 01:43:54,585
[SPEAKER_24]: I like the spirit of that, Ron.

1525
01:43:54,705 --> 01:43:55,146
[SPEAKER_24]: I really do.

1526
01:43:55,586 --> 01:43:55,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I do too.

1527
01:43:59,062 --> 01:44:04,805
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Seth, and I like it, except invaluable and important are kind of saying the same thing.

1528
01:44:04,965 --> 01:44:06,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, OK.

1529
01:44:06,285 --> 01:44:09,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone, synonym, or non-synonym.

1530
01:44:13,188 --> 01:44:14,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Invaluable and necessary?

1531
01:44:15,529 --> 01:44:16,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Significant.

1532
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:17,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Significant.

1533
01:44:18,611 --> 01:44:19,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

1534
01:44:21,712 --> 01:44:22,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I like necessary.

1535
01:44:25,914 --> 01:44:26,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone else?

1536
01:44:28,115 --> 01:44:28,895
[SPEAKER_26]: I like necessary.

1537
01:44:37,658 --> 01:44:38,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that.

1538
01:44:41,379 --> 01:44:47,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that's what I want to get through, at least personally, that these were so incredibly important.

1539
01:44:47,941 --> 01:44:52,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure all of you, just like me, read every one.

1540
01:44:53,162 --> 01:45:01,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a quick grammar, if we phrase it that way, between was an invaluable, invaluable, or, oh, you're right.

1541
01:45:01,484 --> 01:45:01,884
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

1542
01:45:02,344 --> 01:45:02,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1543
01:45:02,724 --> 01:45:03,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1544
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,552
[SPEAKER_26]: This also doesn't have the positive and negative.

1545
01:45:10,313 --> 01:45:12,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, we don't necessarily want to say negative.

1546
01:45:13,155 --> 01:45:14,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we need to.

1547
01:45:14,536 --> 01:45:26,825
[SPEAKER_08]: There were only a few negative ones that I think someone else categorized before and where, you know, someone said we were mentally ill, but we don't need to go into that.

1548
01:45:26,985 --> 01:45:29,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that was a in good faith submission.

1549
01:45:40,785 --> 01:45:42,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, everybody fine with this now?

1550
01:45:43,567 --> 01:45:43,787
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1551
01:45:46,089 --> 01:45:46,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1552
01:45:46,329 --> 01:45:50,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I could chair, could I say a moment?

1553
01:45:55,074 --> 01:45:55,955
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Seth, I'm sorry.

1554
01:45:56,936 --> 01:46:03,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to comment that things did get pretty heated the last up or down vote that we did have.

1555
01:46:04,521 --> 01:46:05,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to say that

1556
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:15,072
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the thought that I think everybody brought to it, and we brought it in our different ways.

1557
01:46:15,152 --> 01:46:31,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanted to make sure that it was acknowledged that we all felt a significant burden to represent the community as a whole.

1558
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:32,679
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that

1559
01:46:34,223 --> 01:46:44,089
[SPEAKER_03]: the committee as a whole did the due diligence of looking through each and every one of those pieces of community feedback.

1560
01:46:46,450 --> 01:46:48,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.

1561
01:46:48,771 --> 01:46:49,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this wording.

1562
01:46:50,272 --> 01:46:52,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the help of the committee to find it.

1563
01:46:55,895 --> 01:46:56,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

1564
01:46:56,796 --> 01:46:57,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1565
01:46:58,777 --> 01:46:59,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Next slide.

1566
01:46:59,752 --> 01:47:04,234
[SPEAKER_23]: Ready to move to the next slide.

1567
01:47:05,834 --> 01:47:09,175
[SPEAKER_23]: We say during the first round of voting, Belinda Sutton received 12 votes.

1568
01:47:09,695 --> 01:47:17,398
[SPEAKER_23]: And the additional votes, I just think when we say additional votes, it sounds like there's extra votes or something like that.

1569
01:47:17,458 --> 01:47:22,760
[SPEAKER_23]: If we said the remaining votes or the other votes went to Jean Barry, additional

1570
01:47:24,462 --> 01:47:26,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we have to use the word votes anyways?

1571
01:47:26,884 --> 01:47:33,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't we just get rid of the 12 votes and just say that the first round of voting, we got Belinda Sutton, Jean Barry Sutherland, and Ms.

1572
01:47:33,911 --> 01:47:34,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Sutton.

1573
01:47:34,872 --> 01:47:36,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we have to use the word votes?

1574
01:47:37,555 --> 01:47:38,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are our top three.

1575
01:47:39,076 --> 01:47:41,879
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna give votes to either one of them.

1576
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:43,841
[SPEAKER_15]: A point of clarification.

1577
01:47:44,661 --> 01:47:47,985
[SPEAKER_15]: With this slide, I edited it.

1578
01:47:48,105 --> 01:47:48,505
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't...

1579
01:47:49,699 --> 01:47:56,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyways, to clarify what we did, just we, in order for transparency, right?

1580
01:47:56,604 --> 01:48:06,851
[SPEAKER_15]: We went through the initial round of voting where if the nominee received 12 votes, then that would be the recommendation to the school committee.

1581
01:48:07,252 --> 01:48:09,473
[SPEAKER_15]: And we did that.

1582
01:48:09,693 --> 01:48:15,678
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think it's notable that Belinda Sutton did receive 12 votes and there were other votes that went to the other two.

1583
01:48:16,153 --> 01:48:20,854
[SPEAKER_15]: And then after all of that, Mr. Donato Jr.

1584
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:26,936
[SPEAKER_15]: then made a resolution or an amendment was passed in order to bring all three of those names.

1585
01:48:27,056 --> 01:48:35,159
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was just, I think, a step-by-step of what actually transpired with what we did.

1586
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:44,522
[SPEAKER_08]: But I- I think because our process was very, a little confusing in the moment that the wording sounds confusing.

1587
01:48:45,687 --> 01:48:48,810
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot that we did it that way, but now that you explained it, now I remember.

1588
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:52,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Jim, point of clarification.

1589
01:48:52,633 --> 01:48:54,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1590
01:48:54,375 --> 01:49:08,607
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could have a slide that shows that Belinda Sutton received 12 votes from the committee, but we can't have a slide showing that Jean Barry Sutherland got 34% of the total votes from the community.

1591
01:49:09,593 --> 01:49:11,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, because the committee was voting.

1592
01:49:11,894 --> 01:49:13,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

1593
01:49:13,675 --> 01:49:15,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.

1594
01:49:15,797 --> 01:49:17,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it looks the way it looks.

1595
01:49:18,879 --> 01:49:19,359
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

1596
01:49:19,499 --> 01:49:20,440
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I want to say.

1597
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:23,762
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense one way, but it doesn't make sense the other way.

1598
01:49:25,242 --> 01:49:25,523
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1599
01:49:26,003 --> 01:49:27,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Now procedure is it was laid out to us.

1600
01:49:28,584 --> 01:49:30,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1601
01:49:30,245 --> 01:49:31,126
[SPEAKER_02]: It was laid out to us.

1602
01:49:31,146 --> 01:49:31,486
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

1603
01:49:31,526 --> 01:49:33,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Jim was laid to us this way.

1604
01:49:34,008 --> 01:49:36,409
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 years back in 2019.

1605
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:38,010
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1606
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:39,291
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of order.

1607
01:49:40,264 --> 01:49:40,884
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, yes.

1608
01:49:44,765 --> 01:49:45,586
[SPEAKER_17]: Like to say something?

1609
01:49:47,826 --> 01:49:49,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that those comments were out of order.

1610
01:49:51,487 --> 01:49:51,628
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1611
01:49:53,748 --> 01:49:54,188
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1612
01:49:54,508 --> 01:49:56,849
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be fine with just listing the people.

1613
01:49:56,869 --> 01:49:59,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how anyone else feels about it.

1614
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:00,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to start another.

1615
01:50:00,150 --> 01:50:02,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I would second that.

1616
01:50:03,831 --> 01:50:05,772
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd vote for that.

1617
01:50:06,772 --> 01:50:09,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I think especially just because we know how this

1618
01:50:09,968 --> 01:50:15,212
[SPEAKER_08]: preceded and we know understand how the Blinda Sutton received 12 and then there were additional.

1619
01:50:15,232 --> 01:50:22,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense to us, but I think- It looks pop heavy.

1620
01:50:22,118 --> 01:50:34,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we understand because we get the, we understand how we voted, but if someone wasn't watching the meeting, I think Paul's suggestion is correct because then it does, it makes it seem like the other people

1621
01:50:35,881 --> 01:50:42,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you weren't here to watch the process, it is confusing to someone what not involved reading this.

1622
01:50:43,227 --> 01:50:44,408
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of order, Mr. Lister.

1623
01:50:45,168 --> 01:50:45,769
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Matt.

1624
01:50:46,109 --> 01:50:51,834
[SPEAKER_24]: Matt Haverstroh, I have no problem with putting, Blueness Sutton received 12 votes, Gene Berry received, I think, seven, right?

1625
01:50:52,034 --> 01:50:52,434
[SPEAKER_24]: And Mr., two.

1626
01:50:54,356 --> 01:50:56,881
[SPEAKER_02]: But you would have a problem with the community slide.

1627
01:50:56,961 --> 01:50:58,904
[SPEAKER_24]: Danny, you have to go through the chair.

1628
01:50:59,085 --> 01:51:00,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll go through the chair.

1629
01:51:00,507 --> 01:51:05,236
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jim, he's saying that he would have no problem with that, but he would have it on the community slide.

1630
01:51:07,617 --> 01:51:09,577
[SPEAKER_24]: Listen, we have a motion.

1631
01:51:09,857 --> 01:51:11,618
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a motion and a second here.

1632
01:51:11,658 --> 01:51:15,359
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm sorry, we have a motion and a second to remove the numbers.

1633
01:51:15,619 --> 01:51:20,580
[SPEAKER_22]: Just on the motion, if I could, the fact is there were no second votes.

1634
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:22,000
[SPEAKER_22]: We voted for the group.

1635
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:28,421
[SPEAKER_22]: So you can't say one got 12 and maybe somebody else would have gotten 12 and we don't identify that.

1636
01:51:28,521 --> 01:51:31,962
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that regard, I think the votes total should be removed.

1637
01:51:33,631 --> 01:51:39,833
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a motion already to remove the votes, the number of votes, and just tell the people that we accepted the three.

1638
01:51:41,473 --> 01:51:53,097
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion, I believe that it is significant to note that Belinda Sutton did receive 12 votes during the first round of voting.

1639
01:51:54,177 --> 01:51:56,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And I understand that it may

1640
01:51:57,886 --> 01:51:59,208
[SPEAKER_10]: be confusing.

1641
01:51:59,549 --> 01:52:09,725
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I also think that if someone is watching this presentation and they're really confused as to what exactly that means,

1642
01:52:10,381 --> 01:52:14,224
[SPEAKER_10]: they are able to go back and watch our previous meetings.

1643
01:52:16,165 --> 01:52:27,694
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel as though in many of our discussions about confusion, these are things that can easily be clarified if someone is that infested by looking back in our records.

1644
01:52:27,914 --> 01:52:29,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that for

1645
01:52:30,036 --> 01:52:51,263
[SPEAKER_10]: many of these committee members who have been repeatedly mentioning transparency, transparency, I think that we should explain this process for the sake of transparency and making very clear what our original process was and what actually transpired through the amended process.

1646
01:52:52,542 --> 01:52:58,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of clarification through the chair, you can't be transparent on one slide and then not be transparent on another.

1647
01:52:58,744 --> 01:53:02,366
[SPEAKER_20]: You're either transparent 100% of the time, or you're not transparent at all.

1648
01:53:02,946 --> 01:53:06,647
[SPEAKER_20]: And I second Ron's comment that Jean did not get any votes.

1649
01:53:07,067 --> 01:53:09,408
[SPEAKER_20]: She could have gotten 12 votes the second time around.

1650
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:12,389
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think this is extremely misleading to the public.

1651
01:53:12,589 --> 01:53:20,232
[SPEAKER_20]: We're either gonna be transparent for community feedback, as well as committee input, or we're not gonna be transparent at all.

1652
01:53:20,868 --> 01:53:26,972
[SPEAKER_20]: My vote is that we are transparent, that we summarize the voices heard from the community and how we got to this voting process.

1653
01:53:27,412 --> 01:53:29,654
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't pick and choose where we're transparent.

1654
01:53:31,915 --> 01:53:32,996
[SPEAKER_04]: For the chair, I agree.

1655
01:53:33,596 --> 01:53:35,217
[SPEAKER_17]: Lee, do you have your hand up?

1656
01:53:36,618 --> 01:53:37,039
[SPEAKER_26]: I do.

1657
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:39,841
[SPEAKER_26]: I am fine with leaving the 12.

1658
01:53:40,101 --> 01:53:47,165
[SPEAKER_26]: As Maria said, I think it does highlight that we use the procedure in the first round.

1659
01:53:47,626 --> 01:53:49,527
[SPEAKER_26]: I am open to removing that number.

1660
01:53:50,138 --> 01:53:57,584
[SPEAKER_26]: But my main comment was going to be, if we leave the 12, we could note here that only three names received any votes.

1661
01:53:58,065 --> 01:54:05,050
[SPEAKER_26]: So during the first round of voting, Belinda Sutton received 12 votes, and only three names received any votes.

1662
01:54:05,391 --> 01:54:08,513
[SPEAKER_26]: So there were only two other names that received votes.

1663
01:54:10,375 --> 01:54:12,276
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so that would be an amendment then, right?

1664
01:54:12,296 --> 01:54:14,618
[SPEAKER_17]: I suppose it would be.

1665
01:54:15,719 --> 01:54:17,741
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, is that a friendly amendment?

1666
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:33,311
[SPEAKER_08]: What about something like Belinda Sutton received 12 votes, and then the committee decided to send through the top three candidates, which included Gene Barry, Sutherland, and Misatoch?

1667
01:54:33,911 --> 01:54:35,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of clarification.

1668
01:54:36,173 --> 01:54:44,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we chose to make that amendment, we actually moved from the process that

1669
01:54:48,007 --> 01:55:07,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick had written out, which assured that the committee would bring forward the slate of three names that the majority felt were the best names.

1670
01:55:08,278 --> 01:55:14,002
[SPEAKER_03]: What we did by moving the amendment was bring forward

1671
01:55:15,192 --> 01:55:24,280
[SPEAKER_03]: the three names that the members of the committee had as their favorite names.

1672
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a significant difference.

1673
01:55:28,043 --> 01:55:40,153
[SPEAKER_03]: The motion did pass with a two thirds majority that the slate that we are passing to the school committee

1674
01:55:42,713 --> 01:56:02,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Two thirds of this committee did find that that slate was the best slate, but it is a specific difference that we didn't have a majority vote on the best slate.

1675
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:10,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we would have gotten if we had gone through with Patrick's

1676
01:56:12,335 --> 01:56:25,903
[SPEAKER_03]: motion, we had one round, and Belinda Sutton was the only name that received enough votes to be put on the list.

1677
01:56:27,804 --> 01:56:36,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Since there were groups of two other committee or groups of people

1678
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:53,303
[SPEAKER_03]: two names then became part of the slate that we are now sending.

1679
01:56:55,344 --> 01:57:08,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the way in which this is worded now is probably, it doesn't get into all of that detail, but it is an accurate representation of

1680
01:57:12,016 --> 01:57:31,634
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if we start slicing and dicing, then we're going to need to, again, in the interest of full transparency, be a little bit more explicit about how exactly we came to pass the slate.

1681
01:57:34,108 --> 01:57:36,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Laura, would you like to speak.

1682
01:57:36,629 --> 01:57:37,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you.

1683
01:57:37,530 --> 01:57:50,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so, I, I think this the way it's written now is the most transparent it doesn't omit any of the steps that we took what we had was essentially ranked ranked choice voting right and that can be a little difficult to explain.

1684
01:57:51,196 --> 01:57:54,419
[SPEAKER_11]: But in ranked choice voting, you put your top name first.

1685
01:57:54,519 --> 01:57:55,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we did.

1686
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:57,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it just might be interesting.

1687
01:57:57,042 --> 01:58:05,550
[SPEAKER_11]: It might be relevant to the school committee that we did have a first round where Belinda Sutton got 12 votes.

1688
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:14,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And as it became obvious after everyone was doing their three minute speech and the way to vote in the first round,

1689
01:58:15,599 --> 01:58:20,722
[SPEAKER_11]: shook out, it became obvious that the other two were likely to win the second and third rounds, right?

1690
01:58:20,762 --> 01:58:27,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why there was a motion to forego the second and third rounds and just to put forth those three names.

1691
01:58:27,466 --> 01:58:37,091
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important to show that and I think it is not transparent to skip an important step that we went through with several votes to get there.

1692
01:58:37,711 --> 01:58:38,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1693
01:58:39,352 --> 01:58:40,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1694
01:58:40,353 --> 01:58:44,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron, did I see your hand up, Ron?

1695
01:58:47,848 --> 01:58:50,210
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm not in favor of listing the number.

1696
01:58:51,211 --> 01:58:55,534
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you've got to go back and look at who got the highest rubric score too, and we're not doing that.

1697
01:58:55,594 --> 01:58:57,796
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm for just eliminating all the numbers.

1698
01:58:57,876 --> 01:58:59,177
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just too confusing.

1699
01:58:59,978 --> 01:59:00,358
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1700
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:04,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Grace, did you have your hand up?

1701
01:59:04,321 --> 01:59:04,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1702
01:59:04,501 --> 01:59:07,563
[SPEAKER_15]: I have an edit I would like to bring forward.

1703
01:59:10,973 --> 01:59:15,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Changing that bullet point of during the first round of voting, blah, blah, blah.

1704
01:59:15,235 --> 01:59:20,258
[SPEAKER_15]: So changing that bullet point to each committee member voted for one nominee.

1705
01:59:20,918 --> 01:59:34,105
[SPEAKER_15]: After the first round of votes was recorded, only three candidates had received a first vote and a motion to amend was made and accepted to offer all three names to the school committee.

1706
01:59:35,426 --> 01:59:36,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you, Grace.

1707
01:59:36,666 --> 01:59:37,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1708
01:59:37,447 --> 01:59:37,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd second that.

1709
01:59:43,103 --> 01:59:43,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody else?

1710
01:59:45,064 --> 01:59:46,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that sounds great.

1711
01:59:46,504 --> 01:59:46,704
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1712
01:59:47,084 --> 01:59:47,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's nice.

1713
01:59:48,664 --> 01:59:51,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Can she say it again so I can type it?

1714
01:59:53,025 --> 01:59:53,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Very well said.

1715
01:59:55,166 --> 01:59:55,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Grace.

1716
01:59:56,406 --> 02:00:00,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it also replaces the next bullet down so that you have space.

1717
02:00:00,627 --> 02:00:01,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

1718
02:00:02,007 --> 02:00:02,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1719
02:00:05,688 --> 02:00:06,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Do I still have hands up?

1720
02:00:07,649 --> 02:00:09,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you mind repeating that for her so she can write it?

1721
02:00:13,727 --> 02:00:14,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I have it written down.

1722
02:00:15,107 --> 02:00:18,549
[SPEAKER_15]: So how about I just, can I just drop it in?

1723
02:00:18,569 --> 02:00:19,549
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, sure.

1724
02:00:19,889 --> 02:00:20,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1725
02:00:21,349 --> 02:00:31,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the idea of it being comprehensible to someone who is only seeing this and who didn't really watch our, our, our YouTube videos that we're currently starring in.

1726
02:00:31,472 --> 02:00:34,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick, give me a hand up.

1727
02:00:39,255 --> 02:00:39,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1728
02:00:40,015 --> 02:00:40,935
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1729
02:00:40,975 --> 02:00:41,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Grace.

1730
02:00:41,776 --> 02:00:42,816
[SPEAKER_17]: You got hands down.

1731
02:00:43,813 --> 02:00:45,414
[SPEAKER_17]: So we all in agreement here?

1732
02:00:45,494 --> 02:00:47,276
[SPEAKER_17]: I like doing a couple more hands, hold on.

1733
02:00:48,877 --> 02:00:49,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Lisa, raise your hand up.

1734
02:00:51,099 --> 02:00:52,680
[SPEAKER_17]: I think your hand's just stuck up, right?

1735
02:00:54,682 --> 02:00:56,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, my hand's not up, sorry.

1736
02:00:56,583 --> 02:00:56,883
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1737
02:01:02,548 --> 02:01:03,108
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Seth.

1738
02:01:03,289 --> 02:01:09,233
[SPEAKER_03]: I copied from the transcript Grace's remarks.

1739
02:01:12,276 --> 02:01:12,496
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1740
02:01:14,451 --> 02:01:14,731
[SPEAKER_03]: the chat.

1741
02:01:18,074 --> 02:01:27,260
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may say, I certainly understand that this is more comprehensible.

1742
02:01:28,321 --> 02:01:40,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think that it is notable to state that Belinda Sutton was the only candidate that did receive 12 votes.

1743
02:01:42,911 --> 02:01:42,951
[SPEAKER_10]: If

1744
02:01:44,188 --> 02:01:53,850
[SPEAKER_10]: it would be acceptable to add in that Belinda Sutton got 12 votes or?

1745
02:01:55,610 --> 02:02:08,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's notable, but then it makes it, for someone who didn't understand that we then voted and changed the procedure halfway through, it just sounds a little like, oh, but these people didn't get 12 votes, that Jean Barry Sutherland and Ms.

1746
02:02:08,852 --> 02:02:11,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Suttuck didn't, and they very well may have.

1747
02:02:11,373 --> 02:02:12,093
[SPEAKER_08]: I just feel like it's,

1748
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:17,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't think of the word.

1749
02:02:18,432 --> 02:02:26,958
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little misleading, not because we're being misleading, just because we, we changed our procedure halfway through for a good reason and for expediency.

1750
02:02:27,479 --> 02:02:33,103
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it would just be a little, people would infer something from it.

1751
02:02:33,143 --> 02:02:33,904
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not really there.

1752
02:02:33,924 --> 02:02:36,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, thank you.

1753
02:02:36,846 --> 02:02:37,407
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my opinion.

1754
02:02:38,808 --> 02:02:39,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Ryan, did you have your hand up again?

1755
02:02:43,071 --> 02:02:43,271
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1756
02:02:43,832 --> 02:02:44,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1757
02:02:45,742 --> 02:02:45,962
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1758
02:02:46,443 --> 02:02:48,245
[SPEAKER_17]: We all agree on this page.

1759
02:02:48,265 --> 02:02:49,246
[SPEAKER_17]: We can move to the next one.

1760
02:02:50,327 --> 02:02:51,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Mr. Chairman.

1761
02:02:52,570 --> 02:02:53,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Patrick does have his hand up.

1762
02:02:54,992 --> 02:02:55,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, okay.

1763
02:02:55,733 --> 02:02:56,133
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick.

1764
02:02:58,216 --> 02:03:06,605
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I just, I just want to explain to folks the reason why the 12 is really significant is the initial charge from the school committee was that

1765
02:03:08,532 --> 02:03:28,609
[SPEAKER_23]: nominees that we bring forward must receive a majority vote and you know to what Seth had said before Belinda Sutton received you know the 12 votes and then we took a vote of two-thirds to send it send the other two names forward so those other two names you know did receive a majority vote

1766
02:03:31,382 --> 02:03:40,429
[SPEAKER_23]: not through the traditional way of the 12 votes that Belinda Sutton received, but it was a compromise vote going forward.

1767
02:03:41,990 --> 02:03:47,674
[SPEAKER_08]: What about instead of first place vote in the last bullet point, we say majority vote?

1768
02:03:47,694 --> 02:03:50,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Because all three did receive a majority vote.

1769
02:03:51,997 --> 02:03:56,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that is- Point of information, Jim?

1770
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:57,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Dan.

1771
02:03:57,401 --> 02:03:59,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Had we gone with the original format,

1772
02:04:00,805 --> 02:04:03,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Tuck could have gotten 15 votes in the next round.

1773
02:04:04,227 --> 02:04:09,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I think to add, put numbers in it makes zero sense at all.

1774
02:04:09,891 --> 02:04:12,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Then in the next round, maybe Gene Barry gets 15 votes.

1775
02:04:13,533 --> 02:04:14,053
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1776
02:04:14,073 --> 02:04:14,994
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just the first round.

1777
02:04:15,134 --> 02:04:19,697
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason why we moved it was because all of us only voted on three.

1778
02:04:19,777 --> 02:04:22,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So we collectively decided to move them forward.

1779
02:04:23,459 --> 02:04:26,021
[SPEAKER_02]: So to put a number in this slide,

1780
02:04:28,182 --> 02:04:30,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not being transparent, in my opinion.

1781
02:04:31,363 --> 02:04:34,403
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what this language is here for, that we have right now in front of us.

1782
02:04:34,744 --> 02:04:37,564
[SPEAKER_23]: I wasn't advocating to have the number put in, Danny, so.

1783
02:04:38,104 --> 02:04:38,364
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1784
02:04:38,604 --> 02:04:39,665
[SPEAKER_17]: We agree on this slide.

1785
02:04:39,725 --> 02:04:40,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Move to the next one.

1786
02:04:43,286 --> 02:04:57,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to say that the language of first place vote is a little confusing to me, because that implies as though, at least in my mind, as though

1787
02:04:58,373 --> 02:05:02,894
[SPEAKER_10]: three names all had a tie for first place.

1788
02:05:03,514 --> 02:05:07,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that the phrasing of first place vote is confusing.

1789
02:05:07,275 --> 02:05:19,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I also would like to advocate for perhaps putting all three numbers because I think that it is significant.

1790
02:05:20,418 --> 02:05:25,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, I'll reiterate that Belinda Sutton got 12 votes.

1791
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:26,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that

1792
02:05:27,332 --> 02:05:48,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there are 22 members of the committee, it becomes clear that those are the three names that received any votes at all, which is why the motion was made to amend and all three names were offered to the school committee.

1793
02:05:52,592 --> 02:05:54,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I make a motion to move on to the next slide.

1794
02:05:57,145 --> 02:05:58,565
[SPEAKER_17]: How many want to second that?

1795
02:05:58,585 --> 02:05:58,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1796
02:05:59,846 --> 02:06:00,746
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor.

1797
02:06:02,646 --> 02:06:02,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1798
02:06:03,946 --> 02:06:04,646
[SPEAKER_17]: Any opposed.

1799
02:06:06,327 --> 02:06:08,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm opposed.

1800
02:06:08,907 --> 02:06:11,428
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm opposed as well.

1801
02:06:11,468 --> 02:06:16,209
[SPEAKER_17]: This is to accept this slide.

1802
02:06:16,249 --> 02:06:17,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Move on to the next one.

1803
02:06:17,469 --> 02:06:18,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Three brothers.

1804
02:06:18,209 --> 02:06:18,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes or no.

1805
02:06:19,429 --> 02:06:19,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

1806
02:06:20,029 --> 02:06:23,690
[SPEAKER_10]: This, this, this feels like a very clear attempt to,

1807
02:06:24,570 --> 02:06:30,655
[SPEAKER_10]: brush off the comments of some committee members.

1808
02:06:30,815 --> 02:06:32,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Seth has his hand raised.

1809
02:06:32,677 --> 02:06:34,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe he had comments to make.

1810
02:06:35,819 --> 02:06:36,700
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth, go ahead.

1811
02:06:39,402 --> 02:06:39,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1812
02:06:39,823 --> 02:06:42,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I now commenting on the motion?

1813
02:06:43,286 --> 02:06:44,967
[SPEAKER_03]: For Christ's sake.

1814
02:06:45,007 --> 02:06:45,988
[SPEAKER_24]: The slide, so.

1815
02:06:46,428 --> 02:06:46,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1816
02:06:48,550 --> 02:06:49,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Lou, I'm sorry.

1817
02:06:49,251 --> 02:06:50,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that directed to me or is the chair?

1818
02:06:50,772 --> 02:06:51,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was talking to someone else.

1819
02:06:51,573 --> 02:06:51,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

1820
02:06:55,136 --> 02:07:02,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, I pass.

1821
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:06,982
[SPEAKER_04]: A motion's on the floor to accept the slide and it was seconded.

1822
02:07:07,142 --> 02:07:08,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody else's hand up?

1823
02:07:08,062 --> 02:07:10,564
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I closed out that window and I can't get it back.

1824
02:07:11,024 --> 02:07:12,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick's hand is up.

1825
02:07:12,785 --> 02:07:13,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick.

1826
02:07:14,205 --> 02:07:15,526
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I gotta take it down.

1827
02:07:16,947 --> 02:07:17,287
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1828
02:07:17,867 --> 02:07:23,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we, I know there's procedure, but if the issue is first place vote, could we maybe just

1829
02:07:24,452 --> 02:07:26,135
[SPEAKER_08]: agree on a wording for that, and then?

1830
02:07:26,155 --> 02:07:29,299
[SPEAKER_23]: It would just be received a vote.

1831
02:07:34,026 --> 02:07:35,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would say received a vote.

1832
02:07:36,185 --> 02:07:38,806
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of order, Mr. Lister, reporting information.

1833
02:07:38,866 --> 02:07:41,306
[SPEAKER_24]: I kind of agree with Maria Roach.

1834
02:07:41,326 --> 02:07:42,346
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Matt Haberstroh.

1835
02:07:43,426 --> 02:07:48,908
[SPEAKER_24]: It just sounds like all three of these people got first place votes and there was a tie at the finish line.

1836
02:07:49,508 --> 02:07:52,468
[SPEAKER_24]: That's clearly not the case.

1837
02:07:53,568 --> 02:07:57,729
[SPEAKER_24]: Linda Sutton got 12, which is kind of blows away everyone else, in my opinion.

1838
02:07:58,049 --> 02:08:01,110
[SPEAKER_24]: So there should be some reference to that in this last one.

1839
02:08:01,550 --> 02:08:04,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, and Gene Barry Sutherland got 423 submissions.

1840
02:08:05,373 --> 02:08:07,614
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to get rid of that, but you don't want to get rid of this.

1841
02:08:07,914 --> 02:08:10,216
[SPEAKER_17]: Please, please, please, please.

1842
02:08:10,696 --> 02:08:11,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Lister.

1843
02:08:12,137 --> 02:08:13,558
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a motion on the floor.

1844
02:08:14,078 --> 02:08:15,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt, you would just vote down then.

1845
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:17,120
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't want this slide, right?

1846
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we're going to vote the slide.

1847
02:08:20,222 --> 02:08:21,783
[SPEAKER_17]: You vote it down if you want it.

1848
02:08:21,963 --> 02:08:23,444
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't like the language, I guess.

1849
02:08:23,864 --> 02:08:26,166
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought we were talking about the language in the slide.

1850
02:08:26,678 --> 02:08:32,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm happy to remove first place vote.

1851
02:08:33,420 --> 02:08:34,521
[SPEAKER_15]: That helps.

1852
02:08:36,001 --> 02:08:36,541
[SPEAKER_24]: It does help.

1853
02:08:36,581 --> 02:08:40,723
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Grace.

1854
02:08:40,903 --> 02:08:42,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we change it to first round vote?

1855
02:08:45,385 --> 02:08:46,565
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it says the first round here.

1856
02:08:46,765 --> 02:08:52,227
[SPEAKER_24]: After the first round of votes, only three candidates have received and it says a first place vote.

1857
02:08:53,805 --> 02:08:57,626
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think Grace's idea of just eliminating that, can also receive a vote.

1858
02:08:58,166 --> 02:08:58,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Majority vote?

1859
02:09:01,526 --> 02:09:03,427
[SPEAKER_24]: No, because some didn't have a majority, so.

1860
02:09:04,747 --> 02:09:07,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was the only, just a vote.

1861
02:09:07,688 --> 02:09:09,608
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, because we, okay.

1862
02:09:10,888 --> 02:09:11,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And a motion was made.

1863
02:09:11,768 --> 02:09:12,808
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1864
02:09:14,569 --> 02:09:15,549
[SPEAKER_04]: We move this now?

1865
02:09:15,849 --> 02:09:20,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I will drop my motion if we just move on to the next slide.

1866
02:09:22,382 --> 02:09:27,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this conveys to the general public, the basics of how we proceeded.

1867
02:09:28,324 --> 02:09:28,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1868
02:09:29,164 --> 02:09:30,504
[SPEAKER_17]: We're all in agreement on this slide.

1869
02:09:30,704 --> 02:09:31,705
[SPEAKER_17]: We can move to the next one.

1870
02:09:33,245 --> 02:09:34,906
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some hands up.

1871
02:09:36,406 --> 02:09:36,726
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.

1872
02:09:37,906 --> 02:09:38,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry.

1873
02:09:39,947 --> 02:09:41,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Maria, your hand up.

1874
02:09:42,688 --> 02:09:47,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I still believe that we should include the numbers, quite frankly.

1875
02:09:47,829 --> 02:09:50,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I, I, I don't.

1876
02:09:51,170 --> 02:09:54,711
[SPEAKER_10]: really see how it would be so confusing.

1877
02:09:54,731 --> 02:10:08,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the language, if we were simply to add after received a vote, may I edit the slideshow just to explain my point?

1878
02:10:10,178 --> 02:10:13,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1879
02:10:14,399 --> 02:10:19,982
[SPEAKER_10]: I can remove it after, but Belinda Sutton received 12 votes

1880
02:10:21,966 --> 02:10:40,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Jean Barry Sutherland received seven votes and miss a tuck received two votes and a motion to amend was made and accepted to offer all three names to the school committee.

1881
02:10:41,458 --> 02:10:45,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe that that is too confusing.

1882
02:10:46,201 --> 02:10:48,803
[SPEAKER_10]: I may I make a motion to

1883
02:10:50,033 --> 02:10:52,354
[SPEAKER_10]: add that to the presentation?

1884
02:10:52,374 --> 02:10:54,755
[SPEAKER_04]: No, my motion's still on the floor.

1885
02:10:55,496 --> 02:10:59,337
[SPEAKER_21]: Jim, may I make a suggestion through the chair to Maria?

1886
02:10:59,817 --> 02:11:02,119
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of order, that would be a motion to amend.

1887
02:11:02,899 --> 02:11:03,959
[SPEAKER_23]: That would be a motion to amend.

1888
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:05,840
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, Kathy, please.

1889
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:16,745
[SPEAKER_21]: If we just put in the word only, after the first round of votes was recorded, only three candidates received, oh, sorry, it's already, only three candidates received a vote.

1890
02:11:16,985 --> 02:11:18,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, it was already there, I missed it.

1891
02:11:20,105 --> 02:11:20,645
[SPEAKER_21]: I retract.

1892
02:11:23,167 --> 02:11:26,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to move to the next slide, Mr. Chairman.

1893
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:31,092
[SPEAKER_17]: We have an amendment to your motion, Paul.

1894
02:11:31,893 --> 02:11:35,675
[SPEAKER_17]: She wants to put it back to putting, I mean.

1895
02:11:38,237 --> 02:11:41,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of order, it wasn't actually to Paul's motion.

1896
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:45,522
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a new motion in and of itself, I believe.

1897
02:11:46,242 --> 02:11:48,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that would be an amendment with a motion on the floor.

1898
02:11:49,072 --> 02:11:51,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Either that or we vote the other motion up or down.

1899
02:11:53,755 --> 02:11:56,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Didn't Paul just say he would withdraw his motion?

1900
02:11:56,757 --> 02:11:57,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I hear that?

1901
02:11:58,638 --> 02:11:59,959
[SPEAKER_22]: With a condition, he said it.

1902
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:05,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, if we moved on to the next slide, leave it the way it is right now currently and move on to the next slide.

1903
02:12:06,864 --> 02:12:16,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, could I offer my motion as instead an amendment to add that to the slide, then move on to the next slide?

1904
02:12:20,577 --> 02:12:27,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll add an amendment to add that there's 423 votes were made for submissions were made for Jean Barry Sutherland.

1905
02:12:28,041 --> 02:12:28,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can go on.

1906
02:12:28,922 --> 02:12:30,322
[SPEAKER_10]: We already voted that down.

1907
02:12:30,342 --> 02:12:32,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, so that's why I'm saying.

1908
02:12:33,824 --> 02:12:35,525
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have not voted on whether or not to.

1909
02:12:35,545 --> 02:12:38,847
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to be able to be presenters to the school committee next Tuesday.

1910
02:12:39,127 --> 02:12:40,088
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information.

1911
02:12:40,148 --> 02:12:42,269
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I come back and forth, please.

1912
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:44,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, please.

1913
02:12:45,471 --> 02:12:49,453
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we all start looking at the presentation and realizing what we're doing here?

1914
02:12:50,035 --> 02:12:58,879
[SPEAKER_22]: If you think putting votes there is going to influence seven school committee people, as opposed to the description of the candidates, then there's something wrong.

1915
02:12:58,899 --> 02:13:03,242
[SPEAKER_22]: I vote as is, move the question, but we can vote on the amendment.

1916
02:13:03,302 --> 02:13:10,945
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, this stuff is getting, you know, we're in our 90 minutes in where we've got another six hours to go with the way we're moving.

1917
02:13:11,045 --> 02:13:14,367
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you want to put the amendment up, let's vote it up and down.

1918
02:13:16,878 --> 02:13:27,324
[SPEAKER_26]: And my point of information is, gentlemen, simply that the way it's worded now, it does not highlight that Belinda Sutton received the majority of votes from our committee.

1919
02:13:28,084 --> 02:13:29,925
[SPEAKER_26]: The public input was not a vote.

1920
02:13:30,486 --> 02:13:32,066
[SPEAKER_26]: Our committee does vote.

1921
02:13:32,327 --> 02:13:38,350
[SPEAKER_26]: Belinda Sutton did receive the most votes, all 12 from our committee.

1922
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:43,993
[SPEAKER_26]: If we have it like this and do not acknowledge that she received the majority of votes,

1923
02:13:44,905 --> 02:13:52,149
[SPEAKER_26]: Even if we don't put in a number, we have not indicated that she received the majority of votes among the names that we put forward.

1924
02:13:52,549 --> 02:13:53,709
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, please.

1925
02:13:53,729 --> 02:13:56,631
[SPEAKER_26]: That's my information point.

1926
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:57,851
[SPEAKER_22]: Lee, I hear what you're saying.

1927
02:13:58,292 --> 02:14:07,336
[SPEAKER_22]: All I'm saying is, as being part of the presentation group, all I kept hearing was, let's be neutral, let's be fair, and let's not enhance one or the other.

1928
02:14:07,776 --> 02:14:11,178
[SPEAKER_22]: I think without knowing the procedure that we went through,

1929
02:14:11,862 --> 02:14:14,503
[SPEAKER_22]: I just, I think this accomplishes the same goal.

1930
02:14:14,523 --> 02:14:17,625
[SPEAKER_22]: There's plenty of time to celebrate in a different way.

1931
02:14:18,025 --> 02:14:24,047
[SPEAKER_22]: This to me is just not significant in terms of the vote, and it would move the question, and that's all I'm looking to do now.

1932
02:14:24,067 --> 02:14:26,328
[SPEAKER_22]: I just don't think it's a significant piece to stand on.

1933
02:14:26,729 --> 02:14:30,410
[SPEAKER_22]: You may disagree, in which case, let's vote.

1934
02:14:30,490 --> 02:14:31,971
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree, I understand.

1935
02:14:32,051 --> 02:14:32,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Ron.

1936
02:14:34,112 --> 02:14:37,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Wouldn't it still be in the script that she had 12 votes?

1937
02:14:39,172 --> 02:14:40,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Not in these bullet points.

1938
02:14:42,194 --> 02:14:44,396
[SPEAKER_22]: No, not if we vote on this slide.

1939
02:14:45,197 --> 02:14:50,181
[SPEAKER_22]: The presenters will have to stick to this script that we write, not going offline.

1940
02:14:51,101 --> 02:14:53,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, no, the script should reflect the slide.

1941
02:14:53,964 --> 02:14:58,047
[SPEAKER_15]: So there will have to be edits made to that.

1942
02:14:58,187 --> 02:15:02,610
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think what we say should reflect what's also on the slide.

1943
02:15:04,537 --> 02:15:06,259
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information, I have one question.

1944
02:15:06,699 --> 02:15:10,663
[SPEAKER_20]: This was supposed to end at six just for my own personal planning purposes.

1945
02:15:10,683 --> 02:15:12,364
[SPEAKER_20]: Are we going to extend this until we're done?

1946
02:15:13,305 --> 02:15:14,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Just got a message.

1947
02:15:14,186 --> 02:15:15,427
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to be off by seven.

1948
02:15:15,908 --> 02:15:16,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Before seven.

1949
02:15:18,530 --> 02:15:19,471
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, thank you.

1950
02:15:19,771 --> 02:15:20,572
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry to interrupt.

1951
02:15:21,273 --> 02:15:21,733
[SPEAKER_17]: No problem.

1952
02:15:21,873 --> 02:15:22,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1953
02:15:23,054 --> 02:15:24,636
[SPEAKER_21]: Can I can I make a friendly amendment?

1954
02:15:25,076 --> 02:15:26,518
[SPEAKER_21]: I think if that's what it'd be called.

1955
02:15:28,364 --> 02:15:28,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead.

1956
02:15:29,244 --> 02:15:40,247
[SPEAKER_21]: So could we say only three vote, only three candidates, and then right after the word candidates, put parentheses Sutton 12 or Barry seven, miss a top two.

1957
02:15:40,587 --> 02:15:41,287
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there it is.

1958
02:15:41,987 --> 02:15:42,887
[SPEAKER_21]: The information's in there.

1959
02:15:49,109 --> 02:15:49,789
[SPEAKER_17]: I second that.

1960
02:15:49,949 --> 02:15:50,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's good.

1961
02:15:51,770 --> 02:15:53,650
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's a friendly amendment.

1962
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:56,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Who's the motion to accept that amendment?

1963
02:15:57,531 --> 02:15:57,691
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1964
02:15:59,097 --> 02:16:01,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1965
02:16:02,118 --> 02:16:06,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we have something on the floor that Paul put up?

1966
02:16:06,598 --> 02:16:10,859
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of clarification, what is the motion that's on the floor right now?

1967
02:16:11,559 --> 02:16:14,540
[SPEAKER_23]: The motion is to keep the slide the way it is and move to the next.

1968
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:21,121
[SPEAKER_23]: But the slide has changed five times since there was a motion to keep the slide the way it is.

1969
02:16:21,421 --> 02:16:24,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the slide the way it is presently, because I'm the one that made the motion.

1970
02:16:25,202 --> 02:16:25,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the motion.

1971
02:16:26,102 --> 02:16:27,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep the slide the way it is.

1972
02:16:28,182 --> 02:16:35,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, move on to the next slide as we were just informed that there's another meeting coming up and we'll never finish this.

1973
02:16:35,669 --> 02:16:38,711
[SPEAKER_04]: As Ron said, we have five, six hours more left to work to go.

1974
02:16:39,152 --> 02:16:42,555
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna have to go to the school committee and ask for another week to delay this.

1975
02:16:43,075 --> 02:16:46,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just move on to the next slide, please.

1976
02:16:47,639 --> 02:16:48,900
[SPEAKER_23]: Who seconded that motion?

1977
02:16:48,920 --> 02:16:49,341
[SPEAKER_23]: I second it.

1978
02:16:54,803 --> 02:17:05,132
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there's a friendly amendment on the, it seems like, or not a friendly amendment, but there's, I don't know if Maria has an amendment or if Principal K has an amendment.

1979
02:17:05,412 --> 02:17:07,694
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't, I think they both have amendments.

1980
02:17:07,754 --> 02:17:12,038
[SPEAKER_23]: I think they say the same thing, but we need to clarify what the amendment is.

1981
02:17:12,518 --> 02:17:15,681
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, I've been trying to keep score, Patrick.

1982
02:17:16,441 --> 02:17:18,203
[SPEAKER_22]: Dr. Grace made a friendly amendment.

1983
02:17:19,244 --> 02:17:22,927
[SPEAKER_22]: Now we're debating, there is no amendment on the floor that's been seconded.

1984
02:17:24,601 --> 02:17:26,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I made an amendment.

1985
02:17:27,102 --> 02:17:29,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Maria Rota made an amendment.

1986
02:17:29,744 --> 02:17:31,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Has it not been seconded yet?

1987
02:17:31,685 --> 02:17:32,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I second it.

1988
02:17:34,366 --> 02:17:35,147
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's vote on it.

1989
02:17:37,788 --> 02:17:41,250
[SPEAKER_23]: Can you say what the amendment is so that we know what we're talking about?

1990
02:17:42,786 --> 02:18:01,295
[SPEAKER_10]: The amendment is to insert after had received a vote, dash, Belinda Sutton received 12 votes, comma, Jean Barry Sutherland received seven votes, comma, and Missituk received two votes, dash.

1991
02:18:01,915 --> 02:18:07,738
[SPEAKER_10]: And a motion to amend was made and accepted to offer all three names to the school committee.

1992
02:18:07,758 --> 02:18:11,800
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1993
02:18:12,428 --> 02:18:14,169
[SPEAKER_17]: on the amendment, Bree?

1994
02:18:15,529 --> 02:18:15,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1995
02:18:18,950 --> 02:18:19,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan?

1996
02:18:20,631 --> 02:18:20,871
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1997
02:18:22,732 --> 02:18:23,072
[SPEAKER_17]: Erin?

1998
02:18:24,533 --> 02:18:24,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1999
02:18:27,914 --> 02:18:28,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Grace?

2000
02:18:30,035 --> 02:18:30,355
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2001
02:18:32,476 --> 02:18:32,856
[SPEAKER_17]: Ken?

2002
02:18:34,636 --> 02:18:34,836
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2003
02:18:36,917 --> 02:18:37,417

[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2005
02:18:41,153 --> 02:18:41,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Laura?

2006
02:18:42,634 --> 02:18:42,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2007
02:18:45,756 --> 02:18:46,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Lee?

2008
02:18:47,697 --> 02:18:47,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2009
02:18:49,899 --> 02:18:50,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Lou?

2010
02:18:50,780 --> 02:18:51,020
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2011
02:18:52,501 --> 02:18:52,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Maria?

2012
02:18:54,862 --> 02:18:55,183
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

2013
02:18:57,964 --> 02:18:58,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Alyssa?

2014
02:18:59,485 --> 02:18:59,786
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

2015
02:19:01,027 --> 02:19:01,607
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick?

2016
02:19:02,448 --> 02:19:02,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2017
02:19:04,409 --> 02:19:04,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul?

2018
02:19:05,470 --> 02:19:06,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Definitely no.

2019
02:19:07,731 --> 02:19:08,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron?

2020
02:19:08,732 --> 02:19:08,872
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2021
02:19:10,505 --> 02:19:10,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth?

2022
02:19:11,985 --> 02:19:12,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2023
02:19:13,866 --> 02:19:14,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Kathy?

2024
02:19:17,387 --> 02:19:17,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2025
02:19:19,868 --> 02:19:20,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt?

2026
02:19:21,388 --> 02:19:21,688
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2027
02:19:23,709 --> 02:19:24,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Janelle?

2028
02:19:26,710 --> 02:19:26,950
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2029
02:19:29,050 --> 02:19:29,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Josie?

2030
02:19:30,811 --> 02:19:31,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2031
02:19:33,892 --> 02:19:34,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Chia, no.

2032
02:19:46,128 --> 02:19:46,868
[SPEAKER_24]: We got 10-10.

2033
02:19:46,888 --> 02:19:51,069
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I got.

2034
02:19:52,809 --> 02:19:56,290
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe Caitlin Shaughnessy is absent.

2035
02:19:56,830 --> 02:19:59,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Caitlin Shaughnessy is absent and Beth Fuller is absent.

2036
02:20:00,691 --> 02:20:02,051
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a tie 10-10.

2037
02:20:05,592 --> 02:20:06,672
[SPEAKER_17]: The debate keeps going.

2038
02:20:09,193 --> 02:20:11,873
[SPEAKER_26]: Parliamentary procedure not saying anything about a tie.

2039
02:20:14,354 --> 02:20:15,854
[SPEAKER_23]: Motion to carry on a tie.

2040
02:20:20,561 --> 02:20:26,585
[SPEAKER_23]: So now we need to vote on the original motion, which is to include this language.

2041
02:20:29,767 --> 02:20:29,987
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2042
02:20:32,369 --> 02:20:34,110
[SPEAKER_17]: As we're looking at it right now in front of us.

2043
02:20:35,371 --> 02:20:38,673
[SPEAKER_11]: On a clarification, can somebody just repeat what we're doing?

2044
02:20:38,693 --> 02:20:40,955
[SPEAKER_11]: What happens when we have a tie?

2045
02:20:42,936 --> 02:20:43,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion does not carry.

2046
02:20:43,957 --> 02:20:45,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2047
02:20:45,858 --> 02:20:46,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Patrick.

2048
02:20:47,539 --> 02:20:48,760
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so we're voting to

2049
02:20:49,373 --> 02:20:51,455
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, this slide as we look at it right in front of us.

2050
02:20:57,680 --> 02:20:58,821
[SPEAKER_17]: Brian, do I see your hand up?

2051
02:21:02,664 --> 02:21:03,865
[SPEAKER_17]: No, okay.

2052
02:21:04,645 --> 02:21:06,747
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, anybody else speak up?

2053
02:21:09,049 --> 02:21:09,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, Brie.

2054
02:21:11,251 --> 02:21:11,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2055
02:21:14,173 --> 02:21:14,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Dan.

2056
02:21:15,174 --> 02:21:15,494
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2057
02:21:17,356 --> 02:21:17,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Erin.

2058
02:21:18,637 --> 02:21:18,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2059
02:21:20,562 --> 02:21:20,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Grace.

2060
02:21:21,682 --> 02:21:22,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2061
02:21:23,903 --> 02:21:24,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Ken.

2062
02:21:24,963 --> 02:21:25,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2063
02:21:26,364 --> 02:21:26,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Kristen.

2064
02:21:27,644 --> 02:21:27,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2065
02:21:29,204 --> 02:21:29,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Laura.

2066
02:21:30,765 --> 02:21:30,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2067
02:21:32,345 --> 02:21:32,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Lee.

2068
02:21:33,966 --> 02:21:34,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2069
02:21:35,046 --> 02:21:35,326
[SPEAKER_17]: Lou.

2070
02:21:35,806 --> 02:21:36,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2071
02:21:37,627 --> 02:21:38,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Maria.

2072
02:21:39,247 --> 02:21:39,507
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2073
02:21:42,048 --> 02:21:42,588
[SPEAKER_17]: Melissa.

2074
02:21:43,948 --> 02:21:44,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2075
02:21:45,429 --> 02:21:45,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Patrick.

2076
02:21:46,569 --> 02:21:46,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2077
02:21:48,550 --> 02:21:48,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Paul.

2078
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:50,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, please.

2079
02:21:51,908 --> 02:21:52,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Ron?

2080
02:21:52,848 --> 02:21:53,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2081
02:21:54,429 --> 02:21:54,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Seth?

2082
02:21:55,890 --> 02:21:56,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2083
02:21:57,931 --> 02:21:58,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Kathy?

2084
02:21:58,851 --> 02:21:59,111
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

2085
02:22:00,732 --> 02:22:01,012
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt?

2086
02:22:02,393 --> 02:22:02,573
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

2087
02:22:05,474 --> 02:22:05,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Janelle?

2088
02:22:07,475 --> 02:22:07,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2089
02:22:09,156 --> 02:22:09,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Josie?

2090
02:22:10,696 --> 02:22:10,957
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

2091
02:22:13,338 --> 02:22:14,118
[SPEAKER_17]: The chair, yes.

2092
02:22:14,438 --> 02:22:17,560
[SPEAKER_17]: So three nos and 17 yes.

2093
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:22,071
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's move to the next slide.

2094
02:22:22,111 --> 02:22:23,672
[SPEAKER_17]: That slide stays like that now.

2095
02:22:33,736 --> 02:22:38,359
[SPEAKER_08]: My only question about this was, do we have permission to use this photo?

2096
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:42,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who added it or is it not applicable?

2097
02:22:42,201 --> 02:22:45,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we're not using this for profit or sales.

2098
02:22:46,303 --> 02:22:46,963
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the photo.

2099
02:22:50,482 --> 02:22:55,184
[SPEAKER_24]: It looks like it's from the Royal House.

2100
02:22:55,384 --> 02:22:57,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Where did you get the picture?

2101
02:22:58,005 --> 02:22:59,685
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a picture from the Royal House.

2102
02:22:59,705 --> 02:23:01,506
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Royal House fireplace right there.

2103
02:23:02,446 --> 02:23:02,666
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

2104
02:23:02,706 --> 02:23:06,007
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's from the Royal House Association's website?

2105
02:23:07,908 --> 02:23:08,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2106
02:23:08,868 --> 02:23:09,148
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

2107
02:23:09,709 --> 02:23:13,730
[SPEAKER_14]: You should indicate that then, please, in case people have questions at night.

2108
02:23:20,302 --> 02:23:31,790
[SPEAKER_20]: point of information when I was editing the slides and we initially put the three names in alphabetical order, I suggested or requested that these overview slides also be put in that same order.

2109
02:23:31,810 --> 02:23:42,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Tuck, Jean Barry Sutherland and Belinda Sutton to keep things in alphabetical order so there could be no indication that we are giving any preference.

2110
02:23:42,817 --> 02:23:43,377
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

2111
02:23:43,818 --> 02:23:44,198
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2112
02:23:45,974 --> 02:23:46,614
[SPEAKER_21]: make sense to me too.

2113
02:23:46,634 --> 02:23:50,156
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's do the content in the way it is now and then we'll just, we'll flip it.

2114
02:23:50,176 --> 02:23:51,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I figured that's something we can do offline.

2115
02:23:51,997 --> 02:23:52,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2116
02:23:52,437 --> 02:23:52,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2117
02:23:56,579 --> 02:23:58,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, does anybody have a problem?

2118
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:00,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the content of this one.

2119
02:24:01,701 --> 02:24:02,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great.

2120
02:24:03,682 --> 02:24:04,082
[SPEAKER_23]: Very nice.

2121
02:24:04,546 --> 02:24:06,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to accept this slide.

2122
02:24:06,407 --> 02:24:07,408
[SPEAKER_23]: Second.

2123
02:24:07,628 --> 02:24:08,008
[SPEAKER_23]: Second.

2124
02:24:09,129 --> 02:24:10,589
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a typo down below.

2125
02:24:10,609 --> 02:24:17,273
[SPEAKER_23]: It opens a rare opportunity, a rare window onto the life.

2126
02:24:17,293 --> 02:24:21,456
[SPEAKER_23]: So all the way to the left, three lines or two lines up from the bottom should say into the life.

2127
02:24:22,877 --> 02:24:23,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, was this a quote?

2128
02:24:25,558 --> 02:24:28,360
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd have to see if someone, it was just pasted directly from.

2129
02:24:28,380 --> 02:24:29,260
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2130
02:24:30,861 --> 02:24:31,702
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd have to check on it.

2131
02:24:32,282 --> 02:24:32,422
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

2132
02:24:34,833 --> 02:24:35,435
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll check now.

2133
02:24:36,057 --> 02:24:37,842
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I'll make a little comment here.

2134
02:25:04,493 --> 02:25:05,413
[SPEAKER_24]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

2135
02:25:05,514 --> 02:25:07,014
[SPEAKER_24]: PB, David Ensign — Herndon, he's on mute.

2136
02:25:07,034 --> 02:25:07,835
[SPEAKER_24]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

2137
02:25:07,855 --> 02:25:12,217
[SPEAKER_24]: PB, David Ensign — Herndon, he's on mute.

2138
02:25:12,237 --> 02:25:12,677
[SPEAKER_24]: PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

2139
02:25:30,875 --> 02:25:31,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it is.

2140
02:25:31,936 --> 02:25:32,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

2141
02:25:32,216 --> 02:25:35,478
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of clarification, do they only hear her story when they visit?

2142
02:25:37,079 --> 02:25:41,462
[SPEAKER_20]: I've never been, so I just want to know, do they only hear Belinda's story, or do they hear the whole history of the royal house?

2143
02:25:43,103 --> 02:25:45,905
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole... Lee could probably answer that one.

2144
02:25:46,832 --> 02:25:54,696
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I assume they hear the whole history of the Royal House, but of the enslaved people, Belinda is the main story that they would hear about.

2145
02:25:54,916 --> 02:26:00,898
[SPEAKER_20]: So we should say that the students attend the Royal House as a field trip and hear the story of the history, including her story.

2146
02:26:01,138 --> 02:26:02,979
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think we just highlight her on the visit.

2147
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:05,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I move to the... Oh, sorry.

2148
02:26:06,521 --> 02:26:07,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this on the next slide?

2149
02:26:07,581 --> 02:26:08,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I move to the next slide?

2150
02:26:08,502 --> 02:26:10,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Are there a couple of slides?

2151
02:26:10,242 --> 02:26:12,023
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, this isn't... Yeah, yeah.

2152
02:26:12,043 --> 02:26:12,904
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, okay.

2153
02:26:13,164 --> 02:26:15,265
[SPEAKER_08]: There's several for each person, each candidate.

2154
02:26:15,805 --> 02:26:16,085
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, okay.

2155
02:26:17,625 --> 02:26:25,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I believe that on the slides themselves, it's clarified that Belinda Sutton is the story which the most is known about.

2156
02:26:26,989 --> 02:26:30,591
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe it's said that they only hear about her story.

2157
02:26:31,991 --> 02:26:37,714
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we- Point of clarification, I don't think you visit the Belinda Sutton house, the royal house to hear about Belinda Sutton.

2158
02:26:37,754 --> 02:26:41,315
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you learn about the history of everything that went on there.

2159
02:26:41,816 --> 02:26:45,097
[SPEAKER_20]: And if we wanna highlight that her story is spoken about because it's the most,

2160
02:26:45,699 --> 02:26:49,281
[SPEAKER_20]: that we have information on, that's fine, but it's not the Belinda Sutton House.

2161
02:26:49,581 --> 02:26:57,165
[SPEAKER_20]: I think this is- We wanna honor Belinda Sutton, and we wanna call the dream space over there, the Belinda Sutton House, that could be a discussion for another day.

2162
02:26:57,185 --> 02:27:03,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of order, that is on a later slide, so we can discuss this once we've moved on.

2163
02:27:03,989 --> 02:27:05,870
[SPEAKER_20]: Maria, can you please learn some respect, thank you.

2164
02:27:05,910 --> 02:27:08,352
[SPEAKER_20]: Please, please, talk to me.

2165
02:27:08,912 --> 02:27:14,115
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, Jim, through the chair, I don't think it's fair to say that you go there to hear Belinda's story.

2166
02:27:14,859 --> 02:27:18,482
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you go there to hear the story about the history of what happened in that house.

2167
02:27:19,042 --> 02:27:21,744
[SPEAKER_20]: And Belinda Sutton is a piece of that history.

2168
02:27:23,145 --> 02:27:24,847
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of order.

2169
02:27:25,127 --> 02:27:26,648
[SPEAKER_10]: That is on a later slide.

2170
02:27:26,668 --> 02:27:28,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we slide down?

2171
02:27:28,109 --> 02:27:28,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2172
02:27:28,329 --> 02:27:29,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we done with this slide?

2173
02:27:29,811 --> 02:27:31,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we move to the next slide?

2174
02:27:31,892 --> 02:27:33,473
[SPEAKER_23]: Kristen, you can remove your note.

2175
02:27:33,593 --> 02:27:35,955
[SPEAKER_23]: It does say, um, on to you.

2176
02:27:36,576 --> 02:27:37,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

2177
02:27:37,436 --> 02:27:37,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2178
02:27:37,757 --> 02:27:39,018
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

2179
02:27:39,378 --> 02:27:39,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2180
02:27:40,419 --> 02:27:40,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks Jim.

2181
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:41,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim.

2182
02:27:43,884 --> 02:27:47,587
[SPEAKER_04]: The Underground Railroad, there's lots of things that you learn about at the Royal House.

2183
02:27:48,788 --> 02:27:54,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I had tickets before COVID started, and I was very disappointed that I haven't been able to go yet.

2184
02:27:56,013 --> 02:27:57,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to take you on a tour.

2185
02:27:57,875 --> 02:27:58,615
[SPEAKER_16]: This is Janelle.

2186
02:27:58,956 --> 02:28:01,578
[SPEAKER_16]: I've actually been on the tour with the fifth graders before.

2187
02:28:01,598 --> 02:28:02,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, how is it?

2188
02:28:02,999 --> 02:28:06,481
[SPEAKER_16]: It is not the focus solely on her, but she is mentioned in the tour.

2189
02:28:07,242 --> 02:28:08,923
[SPEAKER_08]: And do the kids always enjoy it?

2190
02:28:09,404 --> 02:28:10,144
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it's a great tour.

2191
02:28:10,585 --> 02:28:11,225
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds nice.

2192
02:28:11,645 --> 02:28:12,486
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, thank you.

2193
02:28:12,886 --> 02:28:13,647
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so next slide.

2194
02:28:14,053 --> 02:28:14,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Next slide.

2195
02:28:15,114 --> 02:28:15,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2196
02:28:16,494 --> 02:28:17,955
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's see if it's worded here.

2197
02:28:18,316 --> 02:28:26,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Buddy, you're not gonna have as much time as you think, so you might want to be less is more if I can get that across to you.

2198
02:28:28,301 --> 02:28:28,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2199
02:28:28,682 --> 02:28:28,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2200
02:28:29,522 --> 02:28:29,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2201
02:28:36,146 --> 02:28:38,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this one's pretty straightforward in my opinion.

2202
02:28:38,307 --> 02:28:39,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else?

2203
02:28:44,542 --> 02:28:46,103
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the last line in there.

2204
02:28:47,303 --> 02:28:48,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it offensive.

2205
02:28:53,666 --> 02:28:54,266
[SPEAKER_20]: I second.

2206
02:28:56,667 --> 02:28:59,048
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information.

2207
02:29:01,349 --> 02:29:03,870
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the Columbus issue is over.

2208
02:29:04,651 --> 02:29:07,752
[SPEAKER_22]: I do think we should change Columbus with early settlers.

2209
02:29:13,034 --> 02:29:14,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Legacy of the slave trade?

2210
02:29:16,038 --> 02:29:17,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Excuse me?

2211
02:29:17,258 --> 02:29:18,378
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, early settlers.

2212
02:29:18,479 --> 02:29:19,999
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, we've done the argument.

2213
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:21,779
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not our piece.

2214
02:29:22,339 --> 02:29:25,200
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Columbus is just not an appropriate place to have it.

2215
02:29:25,680 --> 02:29:27,920
[SPEAKER_22]: Early settlers seems to cover everybody.

2216
02:29:29,581 --> 02:29:32,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I second Ron's wording.

2217
02:29:32,601 --> 02:29:33,322
[SPEAKER_21]: I accept that as well.

2218
02:29:33,742 --> 02:29:35,442
[SPEAKER_21]: I would second that too.

2219
02:29:36,282 --> 02:29:37,703
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody else got their hand up here?

2220
02:29:37,723 --> 02:29:38,243
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see.

2221
02:29:38,263 --> 02:29:43,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to leave Columbus out of this whole thing.

2222
02:29:43,204 --> 02:29:43,244
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

2223
02:29:45,269 --> 02:29:45,770
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I don't.

2224
02:29:45,850 --> 02:29:46,131
[SPEAKER_17]: I see.

2225
02:29:46,151 --> 02:29:46,992
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see any hands.

2226
02:29:47,033 --> 02:29:48,034
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're good with this.

2227
02:29:48,515 --> 02:29:51,381
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a friendly amendment.

2228
02:29:52,603 --> 02:29:54,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I second Ron's amendment.

2229
02:29:54,968 --> 02:29:55,529
[SPEAKER_04]: My question.

2230
02:29:56,130 --> 02:29:57,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Seth.

2231
02:29:59,893 --> 02:30:04,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, excuse me, while you're talking, can someone take out Columbus there and change the language?

2232
02:30:04,438 --> 02:30:06,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was specifically what I was speaking to.

2233
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:07,021
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2234
02:30:07,361 --> 02:30:18,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So the committee in and of itself was specifically formed because we are addressing the marginalization of

2235
02:30:22,137 --> 02:30:23,578
[SPEAKER_03]: of Columbus's legacy.

2236
02:30:23,958 --> 02:30:31,343
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, it's not up to- It's specifically- Point of information.

2237
02:30:31,903 --> 02:30:36,106
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information.

2238
02:30:37,107 --> 02:30:47,093
[SPEAKER_22]: To think that putting Columbus's name in here is any way a building tool for the city, is a Columbus or early settlers

2239
02:30:47,855 --> 02:30:49,716
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sure he didn't marginalize all by himself.

2240
02:30:49,976 --> 02:30:57,318
[SPEAKER_22]: I would respectfully request that we do not begin the debate again that's been over a year ago settled.

2241
02:30:58,079 --> 02:30:59,759
[SPEAKER_22]: Early settlers covers the point.

2242
02:31:01,880 --> 02:31:03,660
[SPEAKER_22]: Whoever wrote this, who's the writer of this?

2243
02:31:07,382 --> 02:31:08,762
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll offer it as a friendly amendment.

2244
02:31:08,822 --> 02:31:10,123
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise we'll take another vote.

2245
02:31:14,864 --> 02:31:15,404
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree with this.

2246
02:31:17,403 --> 02:31:18,404
[SPEAKER_23]: I have my hand up, Jim.

2247
02:31:18,824 --> 02:31:19,685
[SPEAKER_23]: Go ahead, Patrick.

2248
02:31:20,886 --> 02:31:31,857
[SPEAKER_23]: So I can definitely understand saying the legacy of Columbus as far as Columbus specifically, sort of doing like an end zone dance for some people.

2249
02:31:31,877 --> 02:31:36,881
[SPEAKER_23]: I can have respect for folks that don't want to see that.

2250
02:31:36,921 --> 02:31:39,223
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think that early settlers is way too

2251
02:31:41,134 --> 02:31:41,614
[SPEAKER_23]: squishy.

2252
02:31:41,894 --> 02:31:46,155
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think that, you know, it acknowledges those marginalized by the slave trade.

2253
02:31:46,215 --> 02:31:47,435
[SPEAKER_23]: Someone else offered that up.

2254
02:31:48,336 --> 02:31:54,357
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, I think we need to acknowledge, you know, why people were marginalized and what she overcame.

2255
02:31:54,837 --> 02:31:59,198
[SPEAKER_19]: And so just saying, instead of early settlers in Columbus then.

2256
02:32:00,518 --> 02:32:03,599
[SPEAKER_09]: For this entire slide, I did not write this entire slide.

2257
02:32:03,719 --> 02:32:05,219
[SPEAKER_09]: I did write this last line.

2258
02:32:05,939 --> 02:32:08,860
[SPEAKER_09]: So any friendly amendments should maybe be directed towards me.

2259
02:32:08,880 --> 02:32:09,740
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Brie.

2260
02:32:11,690 --> 02:32:15,931
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, so Bree, would you accept acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of the slave trade?

2261
02:32:16,551 --> 02:32:16,731
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2262
02:32:17,511 --> 02:32:17,811
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2263
02:32:20,492 --> 02:32:29,494
[SPEAKER_06]: You could say acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of colonization and slavery.

2264
02:32:29,514 --> 02:32:33,995
[SPEAKER_06]: That works.

2265
02:32:34,515 --> 02:32:35,015
[SPEAKER_26]: That works.

2266
02:32:37,928 --> 02:32:41,452
[SPEAKER_26]: Jim, does Bree want to speak to why she chose Columbus?

2267
02:32:44,556 --> 02:32:54,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we're renaming the Columbus Elementary School based on what we now know about him.

2268
02:32:54,887 --> 02:33:00,108
[SPEAKER_02]: For clarification, the school committee's renaming the school would just suggest in three possible choices.

2269
02:33:01,128 --> 02:33:08,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, as I said before, I'm against any mention of Columbus in our presentation to the school committee.

2270
02:33:10,230 --> 02:33:23,432
[SPEAKER_20]: When a clarification can breathe, please explain to me the connection between Columbus and Belinda Sutton, or maybe not specifically me, but for those listening, how Belinda Sutton was marginalized by Columbus, please.

2271
02:33:25,485 --> 02:33:30,810
[SPEAKER_09]: uh sure it's um Columbus and his legacy is one of the

2272
02:33:32,457 --> 02:33:59,312
[SPEAKER_09]: it essentially makes him one of the founding fathers of modern slavery, whereas Columbus, you know, marginalized Native Americans who were here first, those same ideals and those practices of like, you know, pushing people off of their land and basically taking them in as slaves, both for labor and for sex trade, that continued well on into modern slavery where, you know, Black people were brought over from Africa.

2273
02:34:00,072 --> 02:34:00,913
[SPEAKER_09]: It is more of a,

2274
02:34:02,484 --> 02:34:04,426
[SPEAKER_09]: a chain of events, you could say.

2275
02:34:04,446 --> 02:34:14,854
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of clarification, Brie, are you saying that Columbus is the name of what you're speaking of?

2276
02:34:15,354 --> 02:34:16,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Totally disagree.

2277
02:34:17,536 --> 02:34:18,116
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, what?

2278
02:34:19,537 --> 02:34:29,605
[SPEAKER_22]: You're using the name Columbus as if it was, you know, all... I just don't understand why you need to put that in other than to inflame the fans who are watching this show.

2279
02:34:31,070 --> 02:34:32,373
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyways, let's move the question.

2280
02:34:34,758 --> 02:34:35,800
[SPEAKER_23]: What's the question again?

2281
02:34:38,908 --> 02:34:39,849
[SPEAKER_04]: to remove that line.

2282
02:34:40,069 --> 02:34:45,012
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it wasn't accepted as a friendly amendment, so we need to put it as an amendment, whatever the words were.

2283
02:34:45,532 --> 02:34:47,273
[SPEAKER_04]: What were your words again, Ron, please?

2284
02:34:47,573 --> 02:34:48,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, these weren't my words.

2285
02:34:49,334 --> 02:34:50,355
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but not your words.

2286
02:34:50,695 --> 02:34:53,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the way you said a legacy of.

2287
02:34:53,717 --> 02:34:55,138
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, they changed that.

2288
02:34:55,538 --> 02:34:58,179
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know who was the one who changed it, but let's vote on that.

2289
02:34:58,460 --> 02:35:00,020
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I got a few more hands here.

2290
02:35:00,060 --> 02:35:01,141
[SPEAKER_17]: Grace, would you like to speak?

2291
02:35:01,641 --> 02:35:04,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so I think yes,

2292
02:35:08,306 --> 02:35:25,934
[SPEAKER_15]: the actions of Columbus did help move and instill practices that were used in the actual slavery within our lands on the U.S.

2293
02:35:26,074 --> 02:35:30,556
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I think that

2294
02:35:34,765 --> 02:35:37,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Columbus never landed in the U.S.

2295
02:35:38,207 --> 02:35:40,748
[SPEAKER_15]: and much less was here in Medford.

2296
02:35:42,229 --> 02:35:54,955
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I guess I will put forth a friendly amendment to change it to acknowledges those marginalized by the legacy of European settlers or colonists.

2297
02:35:55,915 --> 02:36:00,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Just because I think that holds a little bit more true to where we are

2298
02:36:02,148 --> 02:36:06,091
[SPEAKER_15]: located and where the school is and where our city's history.

2299
02:36:07,331 --> 02:36:09,953
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's all I have to say.

2300
02:36:10,734 --> 02:36:23,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure that's that's fine but didn't Aaron also put a put forth a a friendly amendment so now there are two.

2301
02:36:23,522 --> 02:36:26,544
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't accept the other friendly amendment so that would have been a

2302
02:36:26,945 --> 02:36:27,345
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, no.

2303
02:36:27,385 --> 02:36:29,087
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't Aaron's amendment.

2304
02:36:29,827 --> 02:36:32,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Aaron's was legacy of colonization and slavery.

2305
02:36:33,110 --> 02:36:33,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2306
02:36:33,670 --> 02:36:34,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2307
02:36:34,451 --> 02:36:34,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

2308
02:36:34,651 --> 02:36:36,032
[SPEAKER_09]: The other one was, I think early.

2309
02:36:37,213 --> 02:36:38,274
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember what it was now.

2310
02:36:38,674 --> 02:36:39,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Early settlers, maybe.

2311
02:36:40,856 --> 02:36:42,697
[SPEAKER_23]: So do you accept any of those as friendly?

2312
02:36:43,578 --> 02:36:45,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I would accept Aaron's or braces.

2313
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:47,200
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2314
02:36:47,761 --> 02:36:51,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we have slavery in the previous bullet point.

2315
02:36:52,004 --> 02:36:53,165
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe colonization.

2316
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:56,222
[SPEAKER_08]: European colonization would be less repetitive?

2317
02:36:56,242 --> 02:36:56,842
[SPEAKER_17]: Settlers?

2318
02:37:00,425 --> 02:37:02,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Legacy of early European settlers?

2319
02:37:03,107 --> 02:37:05,689
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's the colonization.

2320
02:37:05,710 --> 02:37:07,711
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I like colonization.

2321
02:37:08,712 --> 02:37:16,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, slavery and colonization, colonization, I don't have a strong preference.

2322
02:37:17,739 --> 02:37:18,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we get that changed?

2323
02:37:25,886 --> 02:37:34,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that work?

2324
02:37:34,090 --> 02:37:34,391
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, sure.

2325
02:37:34,411 --> 02:37:34,991
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Lister?

2326
02:37:35,351 --> 02:37:35,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2327
02:37:36,111 --> 02:37:37,152
[SPEAKER_24]: Order of information, whatever.

2328
02:37:37,872 --> 02:37:51,059
[SPEAKER_24]: Brie, would you be OK with acknowledging, well, maybe not acknowledging, but inserting a line that the blended sentence story in the royal house

2329
02:37:52,322 --> 02:37:54,703
[SPEAKER_24]: is part of the curriculum of Medford schools?

2330
02:37:55,203 --> 02:37:57,023
[SPEAKER_08]: That might be in the next, I think.

2331
02:37:57,043 --> 02:37:58,103
[SPEAKER_24]: Already in the slide.

2332
02:37:58,543 --> 02:37:59,003
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, thank you.

2333
02:37:59,944 --> 02:38:01,144
[SPEAKER_24]: Already in the next slide.

2334
02:38:01,204 --> 02:38:03,924
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a, if I remember correct, can I go to the next slide?

2335
02:38:03,964 --> 02:38:04,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we okay?

2336
02:38:04,685 --> 02:38:05,585
[SPEAKER_17]: We all set with this one?

2337
02:38:05,605 --> 02:38:09,165
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's one of the citizens' inputs.

2338
02:38:10,706 --> 02:38:13,046
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to acknowledge whatever Matt's asking for.

2339
02:38:13,066 --> 02:38:15,147
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's in the next slide.

2340
02:38:15,707 --> 02:38:17,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we move on to the next slide, Mr. Chairman?

2341
02:38:18,267 --> 02:38:18,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion?

2342
02:38:20,448 --> 02:38:21,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody happy with the slide?

2343
02:38:23,241 --> 02:38:26,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we go back to it if what Matt is saying is not in the next slide?

2344
02:38:26,925 --> 02:38:29,367
[SPEAKER_17]: We have two raised hands here.

2345
02:38:29,727 --> 02:38:31,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Can we go to that?

2346
02:38:31,229 --> 02:38:41,379
[SPEAKER_20]: Can somebody who actually works in the Medford school system or maybe Lee, what is the actual curriculum that is taught to the children who visit the royal house?

2347
02:38:42,300 --> 02:38:44,682
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it strictly focused on Belinda Sutton?

2348
02:38:44,722 --> 02:38:46,023
[SPEAKER_20]: I need that question answered.

2349
02:38:46,043 --> 02:38:47,645
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like I've asked it twice now.

2350
02:38:48,475 --> 02:38:52,356
[SPEAKER_20]: Is she a piece of the history or is she the entire history of the Royal House?

2351
02:38:52,756 --> 02:38:53,916
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Janelle answered that.

2352
02:38:53,936 --> 02:38:55,117
[SPEAKER_16]: I spoke on this briefly.

2353
02:38:55,197 --> 02:38:56,317
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been to the tour.

2354
02:38:56,657 --> 02:39:02,519
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not specifically focused on Belinda Sutton, but she is something that they do include, they talk about.

2355
02:39:03,119 --> 02:39:03,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

2356
02:39:03,339 --> 02:39:06,620
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think to say that she's mentioned there, it's a given.

2357
02:39:06,740 --> 02:39:15,202
[SPEAKER_20]: I think to highlight that and make it seem like she is in Broadway lights at the Royal House and that's what we talk about there is, again, disingenuous.

2358
02:39:15,877 --> 02:39:17,598
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to put the facts on the table.

2359
02:39:18,940 --> 02:39:19,760
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Lister.

2360
02:39:20,341 --> 02:39:22,062
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead.

2361
02:39:22,743 --> 02:39:23,143
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2362
02:39:24,484 --> 02:39:27,687
[SPEAKER_24]: I certainly wouldn't want to put her in Broadway lights.

2363
02:39:28,487 --> 02:39:36,174
[SPEAKER_24]: I would just simply mention that as part of the curriculum, the royal house is toured by fifth graders and blend this story.

2364
02:39:36,274 --> 02:39:37,275
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on the next slide.

2365
02:39:37,315 --> 02:39:37,995
[SPEAKER_17]: If we get to it.

2366
02:39:38,455 --> 02:39:38,776
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2367
02:39:38,996 --> 02:39:40,177
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you interrupted me.

2368
02:39:40,237 --> 02:39:41,478
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you.

2369
02:39:41,935 --> 02:39:45,837
[SPEAKER_11]: And point of information, in terms of the curriculum, the children do learn her story as well.

2370
02:39:46,297 --> 02:39:55,221
[SPEAKER_11]: I know my daughter did not do the tour of the royal house probably because of COVID, but she did learn about the story of Belinda Sutton, I believe in the third grade.

2371
02:39:56,282 --> 02:40:03,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, the third graders do like where they dress up of different members, like different historical people.

2372
02:40:04,406 --> 02:40:11,449
[SPEAKER_16]: And she's one of the names on the list of characters or people that they may dress up in third grade.

2373
02:40:12,166 --> 02:40:20,191
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information, we did third grade remote last year and we did learn about the slave trade in Medford that included the Brooks, which we have a school named after.

2374
02:40:20,211 --> 02:40:32,418
[SPEAKER_20]: And not once did I see in any of the information that we were presented in third grade to include Belinda Sutton, but we did learn about the rum trade with the slaves for the Brooks family.

2375
02:40:32,478 --> 02:40:41,263
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think we need to take a deeper look into what is being taught because I did remote third grade last year and I don't ever recall Belinda Sutton's name coming up.

2376
02:40:42,443 --> 02:40:45,005
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, I could just put facts out there.

2377
02:40:46,086 --> 02:40:47,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of something.

2378
02:40:49,689 --> 02:40:58,656
[SPEAKER_15]: What's being taught in the school is out of our purview and I know that the schools are working on racial equity and working to adjust to

2379
02:40:59,570 --> 02:41:07,494
[SPEAKER_15]: adjust and add to the school curriculums with the teachers as well as doing an overview of the curriculum.

2380
02:41:07,674 --> 02:41:19,180
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you would like to see more, I would suggest you go send them a letter to that suggestion.

2381
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:19,980
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

2382
02:41:20,712 --> 02:41:21,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we stick to this now?

2383
02:41:22,173 --> 02:41:22,914
[SPEAKER_17]: We run.

2384
02:41:22,934 --> 02:41:26,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, Mr. Chair, just answer the question about what's on the curriculum.

2385
02:41:26,538 --> 02:41:34,766
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say from my own experience that I'm just, I'm sort of embarrassed to say that I didn't know anything about Belinda Sutton until my child brought that to me.

2386
02:41:35,046 --> 02:41:36,448
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was in the third grade.

2387
02:41:37,008 --> 02:41:38,790
[SPEAKER_11]: So at some point it is in the curriculum.

2388
02:41:39,751 --> 02:41:40,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

2389
02:41:41,076 --> 02:41:45,279
[SPEAKER_21]: And if, may I just for clarity, the third grade does biographies.

2390
02:41:45,979 --> 02:41:51,043
[SPEAKER_21]: So it depends on the year and if a child chooses Belinda Sutton to read and do their project on.

2391
02:41:51,523 --> 02:41:53,864
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not like she's excluded from the curriculum.

2392
02:41:54,725 --> 02:41:56,366
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not like she's the major highlight either.

2393
02:41:56,406 --> 02:42:00,749
[SPEAKER_21]: The children just have a list of books they can choose from, Belinda Sutton being one of them in the third grade.

2394
02:42:02,090 --> 02:42:03,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

2395
02:42:04,491 --> 02:42:05,912
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, we happy with this slide?

2396
02:42:05,932 --> 02:42:06,853
[SPEAKER_17]: We're gonna move to the next one.

2397
02:42:08,269 --> 02:42:11,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Folks, we have 10 minutes and then I have to move to the budget hearing.

2398
02:42:11,250 --> 02:42:17,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Chairman, are we going to have to go to the school committee and ask for another week?

2399
02:42:18,111 --> 02:42:21,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as we only have 10 minutes left and we haven't even finished.

2400
02:42:23,393 --> 02:42:24,633
[SPEAKER_04]: We have another meeting this week.

2401
02:42:24,953 --> 02:42:27,034
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a Lisa.

2402
02:42:28,674 --> 02:42:33,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, I'm the advisor to the club and we have to vote that evening on awards.

2403
02:42:33,735 --> 02:42:35,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I was the only night that the coaches could meet.

2404
02:42:37,260 --> 02:42:37,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Friday.

2405
02:42:38,381 --> 02:42:46,648
[SPEAKER_14]: So we need to, I really would rather not meet on a Friday unless it's like two to four or three to five the most.

2406
02:42:46,968 --> 02:42:52,193
[SPEAKER_14]: I just a question.

2407
02:42:52,213 --> 02:43:03,783
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that we had discussed earlier that we did not need to have Lisa evangelist there as a note taker, since the meetings are recorded.

2408
02:43:04,717 --> 02:43:18,920
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we do need somebody because then I'm going to have to go back and watch the meeting and in order to get it all done and ready for the seventh, I'm not sure I'd be able to do that.

2409
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:24,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Could the superintendent find another note taker for us?

2410
02:43:25,162 --> 02:43:27,322
[SPEAKER_15]: My understanding is it just needs to be anybody.

2411
02:43:28,422 --> 02:43:29,703
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that there are some

2412
02:43:31,383 --> 02:43:37,205
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand there's two of you that are designated for that.

2413
02:43:38,405 --> 02:43:43,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anybody else that could potentially step in for us if we need to in order for us to get this done?

2414
02:43:43,286 --> 02:43:45,147
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd have to pay somebody else.

2415
02:43:54,118 --> 02:43:56,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron's original, Ron's original.

2416
02:43:56,499 --> 02:44:05,664
[SPEAKER_14]: I can do two to four or three to five, but it's going to be tough to get the notes ready for Monday.

2417
02:44:05,684 --> 02:44:06,704
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway.

2418
02:44:07,265 --> 02:44:10,887
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why originally Ron did ask for two weeks.

2419
02:44:11,227 --> 02:44:15,289
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately we voted for only given one week to June 7th.

2420
02:44:15,749 --> 02:44:21,312
[SPEAKER_04]: And we should have listened to Ron from the beginning and went with the two weeks because this is the problem that we're having.

2421
02:44:21,992 --> 02:44:22,773
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to finish.

2422
02:44:24,042 --> 02:44:25,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Pulling for an order of the day.

2423
02:44:25,622 --> 02:44:27,163
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to stick on our agenda.

2424
02:44:27,203 --> 02:44:34,104
[SPEAKER_14]: I can ask to see if Susie can do Thursday, but I'm not sure if she's helping with the prom, because that's also Thursday.

2425
02:44:35,225 --> 02:44:36,785
[SPEAKER_14]: I told you guys it was just a tough week.

2426
02:44:38,706 --> 02:44:41,806
[SPEAKER_23]: Lisa, what's the advanced posting, though, the requirement on the posting?

2427
02:44:41,846 --> 02:44:42,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, right.

2428
02:44:42,466 --> 02:44:43,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I need 48 hours.

2429
02:44:43,607 --> 02:44:45,047
[SPEAKER_23]: So it would have to be Friday.

2430
02:44:45,747 --> 02:44:45,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

2431
02:44:46,607 --> 02:44:47,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Good point there, Patrick.

2432
02:44:47,908 --> 02:44:48,308
[SPEAKER_14]: You got it.

2433
02:44:48,328 --> 02:44:52,849
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's either Friday, or we were asking for another extension.

2434
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:59,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, and Grace did mention, other people mentioned, I think a week or so ago, that we might have to ask for another extension.

2435
02:44:59,407 --> 02:45:01,250
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think we should rush this.

2436
02:45:01,370 --> 02:45:04,294
[SPEAKER_24]: As I tell my art students, don't rush.

2437
02:45:04,654 --> 02:45:05,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Matt.

2438
02:45:05,415 --> 02:45:06,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you.

2439
02:45:06,176 --> 02:45:09,040
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to ask for an extension, please.

2440
02:45:09,080 --> 02:45:10,182
[SPEAKER_03]: From a point of information.

2441
02:45:12,084 --> 02:45:34,221
[SPEAKER_03]: From a point of information, the committee could theoretically just move to submit the transcripts as is and then amend as needed at the convenience of the stat.

2442
02:45:34,541 --> 02:45:39,905
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, Seth, I know this for a fact, that is against open meeting law rules.

2443
02:45:41,201 --> 02:45:41,962
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for that.

2444
02:45:42,302 --> 02:45:45,004
[SPEAKER_22]: Good idea, but it is against open meeting law.

2445
02:45:45,385 --> 02:45:48,827
[SPEAKER_24]: Can we ask Mr. Cushing to hire somebody for us for Friday?

2446
02:45:49,828 --> 02:45:52,631
[SPEAKER_24]: That seems like the only option to me.

2447
02:45:52,791 --> 02:45:59,416
[SPEAKER_23]: Wasn't Dr. Cushing the one that told us that we could start the meeting without a note taker because of the transcription service?

2448
02:46:00,797 --> 02:46:07,383
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that was before you came on Lisa, but that's what Dr. Cushing had said when Jim talked about waiting for you to get here.

2449
02:46:08,623 --> 02:46:13,587
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I would propose we try to meet on Friday and Mr. Lister, if you can try to find somebody for through Mr. Cushing.

2450
02:46:15,208 --> 02:46:18,190
[SPEAKER_14]: When you say Friday, what time folks, because it's a Friday night.

2451
02:46:18,210 --> 02:46:20,012
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that's appropriate.

2452
02:46:22,013 --> 02:46:29,079
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, but if you want to do information, I would not be available until four due to my full-time commitment to my job.

2453
02:46:29,139 --> 02:46:31,340
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we can keep it after four, that would be helpful.

2454
02:46:31,380 --> 02:46:35,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for everybody at all on Friday.

2455
02:46:37,631 --> 02:46:43,956
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Chairman, I go back to, again, I am not rushing this process.

2456
02:46:45,237 --> 02:46:47,458
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that we should have a conversation.

2457
02:46:47,478 --> 02:46:51,181
[SPEAKER_22]: A year it took to get to us, they gave us a month.

2458
02:46:52,522 --> 02:46:54,864
[SPEAKER_22]: How could we possibly get it together?

2459
02:46:56,205 --> 02:46:59,167
[SPEAKER_22]: We're doing our due diligence to make a quality presentation.

2460
02:46:59,588 --> 02:47:02,530
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we ask for another week, we meet on Monday.

2461
02:47:03,481 --> 02:47:04,202
[SPEAKER_22]: to continue this.

2462
02:47:04,762 --> 02:47:05,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Just think about it.

2463
02:47:05,983 --> 02:47:07,204
[SPEAKER_22]: Friday we've got to do this.

2464
02:47:07,645 --> 02:47:10,467
[SPEAKER_22]: That means we've got to put it all together and have it ready for Monday?

2465
02:47:10,487 --> 02:47:12,029
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

2466
02:47:12,729 --> 02:47:19,255
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. Chair, if I say Lisa said that we had a 15 minute presentation when we need a half hour.

2467
02:47:19,595 --> 02:47:24,439
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to put on the agenda that we need a half hour to 45 minutes for our presentation.

2468
02:47:25,580 --> 02:47:26,801
[SPEAKER_08]: May I ask a rules question?

2469
02:47:26,822 --> 02:47:29,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

2470
02:47:31,603 --> 02:47:45,409
[SPEAKER_08]: If we as the subcommittee of 10 that are working on this, if we are stay under quorum, are we able to meet in a Zoom to continue working together to do this?

2471
02:47:45,669 --> 02:47:51,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a business level Zoom that has no time limit and I can have people in it.

2472
02:47:52,992 --> 02:47:58,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be willing to host that at a time convenient for everybody if we could work that out.

2473
02:47:58,814 --> 02:48:00,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know if that is against the rules.

2474
02:48:00,717 --> 02:48:05,139
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information, believe me, I want to do that more than you know.

2475
02:48:05,639 --> 02:48:14,663
[SPEAKER_22]: However, I know from the Attorney General's office, all our deliberations need to be done in public with the same rules as the open meeting.

2476
02:48:14,703 --> 02:48:15,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, even if we keep it below the quorum?

2477
02:48:15,924 --> 02:48:17,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Not if they're under quorum.

2478
02:48:17,704 --> 02:48:17,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

2479
02:48:18,004 --> 02:48:19,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Not if they're under quorum.

2480
02:48:19,685 --> 02:48:20,546
[SPEAKER_22]: That is not true.

2481
02:48:20,646 --> 02:48:24,627
[SPEAKER_22]: The quorum, our subcommittee is its own separate public body.

2482
02:48:25,008 --> 02:48:26,008
[SPEAKER_23]: No, no, it's not.

2483
02:48:27,152 --> 02:48:27,493
[SPEAKER_22]: It's not.

2484
02:48:27,513 --> 02:48:28,853
[SPEAKER_23]: Patrick, I will say.

2485
02:48:28,934 --> 02:48:32,316
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a work group established through our committee.

2486
02:48:32,456 --> 02:48:34,257
[SPEAKER_22]: Point of information.

2487
02:48:34,738 --> 02:48:36,219
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not a subcommittee.

2488
02:48:37,219 --> 02:48:38,620
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I'm no expert.

2489
02:48:38,660 --> 02:48:41,042
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why I went to go to do this research.

2490
02:48:41,523 --> 02:48:42,783
[SPEAKER_22]: But point of information.

2491
02:48:43,024 --> 02:48:43,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you want me to read it?

2492
02:48:43,824 --> 02:48:45,485
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if you want me to read it or not.

2493
02:48:46,226 --> 02:48:47,106
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm familiar with it.

2494
02:48:47,167 --> 02:48:47,527
[SPEAKER_23]: I read it.

2495
02:48:47,607 --> 02:48:48,167
[SPEAKER_22]: Go read it.

2496
02:48:49,248 --> 02:48:54,732
[SPEAKER_22]: The 10-person subcommittee of the advisory committee is also a public body in its own right.

2497
02:48:55,398 --> 02:49:06,048
[SPEAKER_22]: This means that the subcommittee must follow all of the requirements of an open meeting law, including the prohibition on a quorum deliberating, deliberating out.

2498
02:49:06,128 --> 02:49:08,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me finish the deliberating outside of meeting.

2499
02:49:09,372 --> 02:49:15,738
[SPEAKER_22]: Deliberation is defined as any oral or written communication through any media between or amongst the quorum.

2500
02:49:16,090 --> 02:49:19,993
[SPEAKER_22]: of a public body on a public business within its jurisdiction.

2501
02:49:20,374 --> 02:49:26,879
[SPEAKER_22]: To be deliberation, the communication must reach a quorum of the public body, which is the subcommittee.

2502
02:49:27,240 --> 02:49:30,642
[SPEAKER_23]: An email from... Who's this from, Ron?

2503
02:49:31,203 --> 02:49:33,065
[SPEAKER_22]: This is from the Attorney General's office.

2504
02:49:34,105 --> 02:49:40,591
[SPEAKER_22]: The first line is the 10 person subcommittee of the advisory committee is a public body in its own right.

2505
02:49:40,877 --> 02:49:42,439
[SPEAKER_22]: That's its first sentence, Patrick.

2506
02:49:42,699 --> 02:49:45,802
[SPEAKER_22]: Again, I defer to you, but it's in writing.

2507
02:49:46,102 --> 02:49:47,864
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, this is their opinion.

2508
02:49:47,884 --> 02:49:52,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you able to show that to us?

2509
02:49:53,410 --> 02:49:55,972
