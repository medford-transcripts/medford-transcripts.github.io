[SPEAKER_01]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:45,939
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thanks so much for being with me today.

10
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:50,823
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:51,743 --> 00:00:53,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, my name is Erica Reinfeld.

12
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:57,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I use she series pronouns, and I am a candidate for Medford School Committee.

13
00:00:57,948 --> 00:00:59,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

14
00:00:59,629 --> 00:01:03,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk definitely more about your campaign as we continue today.

15
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:10,557
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we could start the interview with the question that we ask everybody on the show, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

16
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:11,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you like to eat there?

17
00:01:12,546 --> 00:01:22,713
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is getting harder and harder to answer, because we keep getting new restaurants, new businesses in Medford, but I am going to go with my classic Goldilocks, and I always get the NovaLocks sandwich.

18
00:01:23,073 --> 00:01:25,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I do mix up which type of bagel I want.

19
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Onion, garlic, salt, a lot of good options out there.

20
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:35,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that I've ever had a breakfast sandwich there, but that sounds good.

21
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:36,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

22
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just start by telling us, you mentioned you're running for school committee, if you could talk a little bit about how you arrived at that decision and what your path to local politics has looked like.

23
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:48,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

24
00:01:48,134 --> 00:01:51,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was never looking for a path to local politics.

25
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:56,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been working in education for my whole career and I have been

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,062
[SPEAKER_00]: tuned into the school committee meetings for quite a while.

27
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:01,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two kids.

28
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:05,986
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about almost halfway through my Medford Public Schools journey.

29
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:22,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a third grader and a seventh grader, and I have been watching the school committee for years and being really interested in the work that they're doing and thinking, someone like me who has worked in education and who has had a lot of interactions with teachers, with students, with families,

30
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:28,642
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a voice that would be really welcome in these discussions about these big hard questions.

31
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:38,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Medford over the last few years has seen a lot of change and I see a lot of change coming down the line and so I want to be a part of that conversation and

32
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:44,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to a lot of the folks who were on school committee and tried to get a sense of what it was all about.

33
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:59,037
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a real opportunity to make a difference for students and involve more of our community in the decision making and hold people accountable and make sure the things that we're doing are really working for our students and all the students.

34
00:03:01,038 --> 00:03:01,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

35
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:11,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know the last couple of years like with coven and some of the stuff we've been seeing maybe highlighted more about our schools like some of the kind of like.

36
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,432
[SPEAKER_02]: some like violence and just sort of like the some of the like social emotional needs of students.

37
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:36,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if you could say, kind of like what, you know, what your sort of priorities would be for change, like maybe what you see is going well, what you see, if elected, you'd kind of want to make priorities for, like kind of the focus of your time.

38
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:50,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so again, that's a very big question, but I think my priority is really about school culture and making sure people feel like they belong and that they have a voice in what's going on and in the decisions that are being made.

39
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:53,038
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that affects social emotional health.

40
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it affects physical health.

41
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:02,186
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely affects intellectual health and the way people learn and that people are showing up excited to learn and feeling valued.

42
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And like their expertise is,

43
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,610
[SPEAKER_00]: is contributing to the way schools are.

44
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:22,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think my priority is culture, but I think there are a lot of policies that we can look at to make sure things are consistent, that they are meeting different students where they are, and just really reflecting the needs of the community and letting

45
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:38,168
[SPEAKER_00]: the broader community, yes, teachers and students and staff and families, but also broader Medford and look at the resources that exist in this community and try to bring them into the schools even more and inform people about what's happening in the schools.

46
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:49,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, we are all citizens of Medford and these are our schools, these are our values, and it really has to be reflected and we need buy-in.

47
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:58,260
[SPEAKER_00]: So my campaign is, I'm trying to build it around these three ideas of curriculum and culture and community.

48
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliterative there, too.

49
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:03,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I love alliteration.

50
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:11,390
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my, I don't know, weaknesses as a writer, as an educator, as a communicator.

51
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sucker for alliteration and I'm a sucker for puns.

52
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:18,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, feels like a good campaign slogan too.

53
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:32,270
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see as kind of, you know, you pointed to like culture being an important part for you and what do you see that like could be improved about culture that would sort of aid to that sense of belonging for students?

54
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:36,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that I would love to see

55
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:46,779
[SPEAKER_00]: more opportunities for students to collaborate and support each other and look at learning kind of across different age levels across different cohorts.

56
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,102
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I did at the Roberts Elementary School.

57
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:57,867
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had fantastic tradition of art night and STEM night and it was often something that the kids came in and they did and

58
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:00,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was great.

59
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:09,674
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said, look, we could we could make this more we could bring in these resources from the community we could have middle and high school kids come back and volunteer and help and teach back.

60
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:12,857
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would love to see more of that.

61
00:06:13,318 --> 00:06:15,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see greater representation.

62
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:34,612
[SPEAKER_00]: In the curriculum, making sure that we're we're meeting kids where they are and also that the skills and the knowledge and the materials and the resources that they have really reflect the diversity of lived experience in our community that kids can see themselves where they're going and have that have that voice and the teachers.

63
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:50,906
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't just receiving this is this is what you have to teach this is what you this is what you are being handed down upon high but you really know how to personalize it how to customize it for your students, and this is this is how it can be used.

64
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:53,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I think people.

65
00:06:55,205 --> 00:07:04,172
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to value each other as humans, as learners, as partners in learning is really what we need to make school culture important.

66
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:17,401
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at different stages, it's knowledge, but it's also skills and it's working together and it's attitudes and it's valuing the people around us and what we have to offer and teaching empathy and

67
00:07:19,803 --> 00:07:26,809
[SPEAKER_00]: just knowing that we are all in this together and that what you do affects other people and having that sense of responsibility in our schools.

68
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that.

69
00:07:28,711 --> 00:07:29,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that.

70
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:37,088
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many like things that seem kind of arbitrary, but it really do build on that like culture and sense of belonging.

71
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:49,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example, I know you and I have talked about the paperwork that you fill out for kindergartners and how it, when my son was in kindergarten just two years ago, it was all like mother, father was how you had to fill it out.

72
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:58,801
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm part of a two-mom family and this is the first year in seven, eight years in the system that we have not had to cross off father.

73
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:03,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that was exciting and it's such a, you know, it feels like a little thing.

74
00:08:03,606 --> 00:08:06,009
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take that much time to cross it off, but it.

75
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,961
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes you feel like you're part of the school.

76
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:14,463
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember a first grade project we had, and it was a family tree project.

77
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:22,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And a teacher took the time to paste in another mother on top of, in that tree branch.

78
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:32,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing that, you know, I think we see this in history curricula, I think Medford is probably overdue to be looking at some of its,

79
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:47,302
[SPEAKER_00]: materials to kind of make sure that we're telling things from lots of different perspectives, that we're not learning the same things that many of us learned when we were in school and we were

80
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,310
[SPEAKER_00]: less aware.

81
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,272
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a white woman and I bring that perspective to schools.

82
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:57,153
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a neurotypical learner.

83
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,893
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a visual learner.

84
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:02,795
[SPEAKER_00]: There are just a huge range of diversity that I want to consider.

85
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:06,276
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to talk about the federally protected classes.

86
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:08,857
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely important, but there are so many other

87
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:14,400
[SPEAKER_00]: components of our identities that we bring to our ability to learn, our ability to teach.

88
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like home life, language at home, access to resources, those all make a huge difference.

89
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:28,349
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to be looking at what individual students have, what our students as a whole have, look for patterns.

90
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:31,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are people slipping through the cracks?

91
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,925
[SPEAKER_00]: and what opportunities, what barriers are there for everybody participating in schools?

92
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:45,774
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look around at PTO meetings, at staff meetings, are we seeing the people who are in our community or are we seeing a subset of them?

93
00:09:47,665 --> 00:10:06,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think you know your earlier answer it kind of also spoke to that like engagement that's not just engaging our kids and learning but in our like parents in the process and kind of keeping that engagement throughout like elementary, middle and high school and I feel I like that idea of involving.

94
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:11,976
[SPEAKER_02]: like older kids in those STEM nights and art nights, which I thought were like really fun to go to.

95
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:16,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's no one cooler to my kids than like older kids.

96
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So like seeing those older kids think, well, like STEM is cool, like art is cool.

97
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:26,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that really would like that really would build a nice sort of investment for them.

98
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:27,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and then also,

99
00:10:28,185 --> 00:10:34,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it also gives those older kids a chance to teach back and to show off what they're learning and know what they're learning.

100
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:41,497
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as part of that process, actually, they engaged with folks from Medford Arts Council, Beautiful Stuff Project, Tufts Engineering.

101
00:10:41,657 --> 00:10:48,503
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were there seeing other people in their community who were doing these things and could see what this would look like.

102
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:53,509
[SPEAKER_00]: what the many possibilities were, because that's what education is about, right?

103
00:10:53,569 --> 00:11:00,357
[SPEAKER_00]: It's opening up possibilities and letting people figure out who they are, who they want to be, and how they are going to make a difference in the world.

104
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:08,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Minerka, what do you see as the most sort of pressing issues for our schools?

105
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:20,558
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so our schools have faced a lot of challenges, but I think the most pressing issue is probably getting the resources we need into the schools.

106
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's money.

107
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, we are facing big budget questions.

108
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's dangerous to talk about money, but that's a big thing.

109
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:34,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that Medford High School needs a lot of help.

110
00:11:35,850 --> 00:12:02,175
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm really concerned about is making sure that we're communicating what those needs are, not just that there's a need, but what they are, so that when the school committee, when city council says we need this money, that no one in the community is surprised about what's going to be done with it and understanding that these are the great things that are already happening that we can do more of, or these are the things that are not happening that we need more of, and that people trust

111
00:12:04,571 --> 00:12:09,995
[SPEAKER_00]: the community leaders, trust the school leaders, the elected officials to make these decisions.

112
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:15,699
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think building that relationship of communication and trust is really essential.

113
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:21,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at resources, not just in terms of money, but in terms of expertise in the community.

114
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:25,706
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, you know, we have Tufts, we have brand new art center coming online, we have

115
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:32,055
[SPEAKER_00]: booming biotech, lots of local businesses that are so great about supporting our schools.

116
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:48,520
[SPEAKER_00]: You see them sponsoring all kinds of events, but I think we can really formalize some of that and bring people together to change the way we do education and to make sure that it's really reflective of who we are as a community.

117
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,042
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

118
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:59,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else, any other thoughts about change priorities if elected?

119
00:13:00,265 --> 00:13:00,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

120
00:13:00,926 --> 00:13:06,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see even more service-oriented learning and experiential learning.

121
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:11,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd also love us to look at the assessments that we're giving people.

122
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they giving teachers and students the information that they need?

123
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:15,872
[SPEAKER_00]: to succeed.

124
00:13:15,892 --> 00:13:18,054
[SPEAKER_00]: I think data is great.

125
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a scientist by training.

126
00:13:20,236 --> 00:13:27,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I love data and I like quantitative data, but I also really like qualitative data and hearing about the experience.

127
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:33,685
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think all of those things are things that we need to look at and we need to make sure that it's working for everyone.

128
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:35,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

129
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:40,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so my next question, maybe a little more fun.

130
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:50,179
[SPEAKER_02]: But so, so the kind of the hope of these interviews with different candidates is to kind of provide a bit of a human element, not just sort of like hearing about your platform.

131
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if you could share something with us that like, we might not know about you but might surprise us.

132
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:59,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.

133
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:06,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so my fun fact that I always share with people when we have to share something people don't know about you is that I still have one of my baby teeth.

134
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:10,084
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to say this is like it keeps a kid inside of me.

135
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a tooth that just hasn't come out.

136
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:14,207
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the surprising thing

137
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:26,394
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have is that I was really, really shy as a kid, which surprises people because I love going out and talking to people, talking to neighbors.

138
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:40,342
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of why I'm in the school committee race is I've had all these conversations with people and I've heard lots of different thoughts and ideas and I want to bring those voices into collaboration with the other members of the school committee.

139
00:14:41,082 --> 00:14:48,446
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really, really love that interaction I am an extrovert, I get, I get charged from talking to people that I was really shy as a kid.

140
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:54,909
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that can be surprising, but I know what it's like to not fit in or to not.

141
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,543
[SPEAKER_00]: not feel entirely comfortable somewhere.

142
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:02,610
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always remember that when I'm working with students.

143
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:11,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, that's hopeful to hear too that kids can kind of shift that throughout their lives, but also, it sounds like it's a good

144
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:17,007
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a helpful experience to have when working with kids and understanding that experience.

145
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:21,309
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say it shaped who I became as an educator as well.

146
00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:26,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my parents looked at me when I was eight and said, yeah, you're pretty shy.

147
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,032
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to throw you into theater camp.

148
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,973
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sending you to theater class.

149
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:33,595
[SPEAKER_00]: I went there and I ended up majoring in theater in college, theater and astronomy.

150
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:35,576
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a scientist and an artist by training.

151
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:53,126
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a huge advocate for access to the arts and for interdisciplinary learning and seeing connections and how things, how things connect so I would love to see more interdisciplinary learning, I know I'm heading into platform again and we're.

152
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:57,268
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my thing.

153
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:00,669
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing what skills you learn from doing these activities.

154
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:06,930
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we need kids, we need to eliminate barriers to access to these activities.

155
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:15,793
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sports teaches teamwork and resilience and all kinds of skills that you can get in the classroom, but also beyond.

156
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:17,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And the arts is creativity.

157
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:25,475
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say, look, I've directed plays and I use my project management experience just as much as I used any of my

158
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,497
[SPEAKER_00]: astronomy knowledge when I was teaching astronomy.

159
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:32,119
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things contribute to who we are as people.

160
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:47,750
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think kids just really need the opportunity to develop themselves as whole people and to learn from each other because the people that I have met doing these diverse activities and jobs, and it shapes who I am and how I interact with the world.

161
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what I would love to see in Medford schools.

162
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:53,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great.

163
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:55,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that sounds, that sounds great.

164
00:16:55,553 --> 00:17:11,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, yeah, I think we have this idea sort of of like what students are exposed to and sort of, you know, like the athletes and the drama kids, but that like there's a real importance to being able to be exposed to all of that and like that kind of being de-stigmatized, right?

165
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:12,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.

166
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:19,002
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, so- And to not pigeonhole people and to say, I am a math person or I am a writer.

167
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:20,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I like both those things.

168
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:21,745
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think kids can too.

169
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:30,472
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think trying things out and failing or succeeding or discovering something you do or don't like is a really powerful way to grow.

170
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:39,198
[SPEAKER_00]: And our schools have to be a safe place for people to experiment with those experiences, with those identities.

171
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:40,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

172
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:45,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Which kind of brings us back to your sort of first point about meeting kids where they're at and that culture piece, right?

173
00:17:45,594 --> 00:17:51,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how can the school support kids being those more like well-rounded people, right?

174
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:52,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

175
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:55,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because ultimately it's the kids who are going to make the decision.

176
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:59,083
[SPEAKER_00]: These kids are going to become adults and they are becoming adults.

177
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:02,845
[SPEAKER_00]: They become people and real whole people.

178
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:05,967
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're the ones who are going to be determining who they are and what they do.

179
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:10,289
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the teacher saying, you will be this when you grow up.

180
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:13,530
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, I will become this kind of person.

181
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make these choices.

182
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:26,354
[SPEAKER_00]: And so giving them the information they need to make the choices and understanding how those choices have an impact on themselves, on each other, on their futures, all of that.

183
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:27,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

184
00:18:28,688 --> 00:18:29,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Well put.

185
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:37,128
[SPEAKER_02]: So my last question is just, is there anything that you want to mention any like events coming up or any ways that we can learn more about your campaign?

186
00:18:38,141 --> 00:18:40,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm doing a couple of meet and greets coming up.

187
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:48,465
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a meet and greet up in Fulton Heights on the 18th of September.

188
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this will air before then.

189
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:59,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Colleen's, speaking of wonderful local food businesses, has so generously invited all the candidates to do meet and greets there.

190
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,550
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna be with a few of the other school committee candidates.

191
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:21,527
[SPEAKER_00]: On, I think it's Thursday the 28th and of September and Thursday, October 5 we've got a couple of the school committee candidates coming to talk about their experience and we've paired up some incumbents with with challengers or with with new folks to the race.

192
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:25,270
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of get a sense of how we how we interact, how we

193
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:34,287
[SPEAKER_00]: bring different and diverse perspectives to the same questions and what it might look like for people to be collaborating on these issues.

194
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:39,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a reason it's a school committee and not one person making decisions.

195
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:41,393
[SPEAKER_00]: We need all of these perspectives.

196
00:19:41,653 --> 00:19:44,456
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited to talk with people in the community.

197
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:46,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I need some ice cream.

198
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:47,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.

199
00:19:47,998 --> 00:19:50,300
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Erica.

200
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much.

201
00:19:51,401 --> 00:19:53,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else that you want to mention before we wrap up?

202
00:19:54,206 --> 00:20:04,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there are so many things to talk about with Medford schools, but I think I would rather just have people come to my website, reach out to me, ereinfeld4, number four, medfordsc at gmail.com.

203
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:10,755

204
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I'm not in it for the politics.

205
00:20:12,976 --> 00:20:20,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in it for the education and the experience that our students, our teachers, our staff, our families, our community is having in Medford schools.
