1
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:05,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:07,846
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited to present today's episode.

3
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:12,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I get to the interview, I wanted to announce that the Medford Family Network Gala is back.

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:18,336
[SPEAKER_00]: The night under 10,000 lights is scheduled for Saturday, September 10th at Wright's Pond from 6 to 10 p.m.

5
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Tickets and sponsorship opportunities are still available.

6
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the link in today's show notes to find out more.

7
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:27,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy the interview.

8
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,696
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks, everybody, for joining us today.

9
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:41,540
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could just start by having our guests introduce yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So hi, my name is Laura Rotolo.

11
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I also pronounce it Laura.

12
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me here.

13
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm she, her, hers.

14
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:53,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Medford.

15
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,189
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a lawyer and advocate.

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I work currently at the ACLU of Massachusetts.

17
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,954
[SPEAKER_02]: the American Civil Liberties Union, where I am a field director.

18
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:11,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So I lead our organizers, lobbyists, and political advocates in all of the work that the ACLU does.

19
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,521
[SPEAKER_02]: So my base is in immigrants' rights.

20
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:16,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an immigrant myself from Argentina.

21
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:24,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of my career has been defending and protecting and promoting immigrants' rights in the United States.

22
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:29,690
[SPEAKER_02]: But currently, I lead a team of advocates that work on a variety of civil rights issues.

23
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:35,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a mom, two kids in Medford, and I live near Wrights Pond.

24
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:37,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's sweet.

25
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:38,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I live near Wrights Pond as well.

26
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:51,705
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get into our rather serious topic today, I'll ask you the question that I ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

27
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,246
[SPEAKER_02]: My go-to is Tenocht.

28
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:54,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have a favorite?

29
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:55,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Once a week, probably.

30
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:57,745
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're at dinner, too.

31
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:59,106
[SPEAKER_02]: My kids love it.

32
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,148
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a favorite of everyone's.

33
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,949
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a favorite item on the menu?

34
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:06,671
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite is the tortas, which is the sandwiches.

35
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:09,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also get burritos and burrito bowls.

36
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:10,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

37
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:11,194
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

38
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:15,177
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll mention just Shelly is here co-hosting with me today.

39
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:16,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelly here.

40
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,660
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might hear my voice is a little gone.

41
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,922
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to lean on Shelly today to do a lot of the interviewing.

42
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,623
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pass it to you.

43
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:25,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into it.

44
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:36,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to start, maybe Laura, you could speak to some of the ways that the recent overturning of Roe has impacted you in the immediate sort of professional world that you move in.

45
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So the overturning of Roe v. Wade was

46
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:46,801
[SPEAKER_02]: On the one hand, well, it's monumental, historic, devastating.

47
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:52,704
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no overstating the impact that this is going to have on millions of people in the country.

48
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:59,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we got that bizarre sneak peek in May, it gave us a little bit of time to organize.

49
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,352
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also gave us a little bit of pause that maybe perhaps this wasn't going to happen.

50
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:15,817
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, of course, we saw just very recently that the Supreme Court did go ahead and overturn Roe versus Wade, ending the federal constitutional right to an abortion.

51
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:18,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.

52
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:24,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of us felt we said these words to each other, my friends and I said, we feel like we've been punched in the stomach.

53
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:25,542
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very.

54
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:33,585
[SPEAKER_02]: physical feeling that morning where I don't remember my physical reaction, but I remember my kids came to me and said, mom, you just screamed.

55
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:36,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you put your head down and you didn't move for a long time.

56
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:37,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, what is happening?

57
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:52,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of us felt that way, that after 50 years of believing that we had made progress, that we had this constitutional protection to bodily autonomy that was ripped out from under us.

58
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:52,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So

59
00:03:53,795 --> 00:04:05,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're all still reeling in that very emotional reaction and at the same time getting ready for the work that is coming at us very quickly now.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I share the visceral reaction that maybe you and others had.

61
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:17,006
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter and I were lucky enough to see you speak at the abortion rally with Maura Healey.

62
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:26,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the comments that was made was sort of, you know, not to worry, abortions will be protected in the state of Massachusetts.

63
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:31,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my mind sort of went to, well, you know, what does that mean?

64
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that really true?

65
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:36,117
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's fear around, like, can this really happen at the federal level?

66
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,318
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean for state level?

67
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:50,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, maybe if you could speak to thoughts around abortion security in Massachusetts, and then maybe even what it might mean here at home in Medford and for folks needing birth control options locally.

68
00:04:52,082 --> 00:05:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, and I think we can still feel good that abortion is legal in Massachusetts, to this day, and there's no sense that it will go away anytime soon.

69
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:05,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is all correct.

70
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:16,703
[SPEAKER_02]: What the advocates in Massachusetts did was to make sure that a year ago, the state legislature enshrined that protection into statute.

71
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:20,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have, we call it the Roe Act that was passed.

72
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:25,449
[SPEAKER_02]: It was vetoed by Governor Baker, but the legislature was able to override that veto.

73
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:31,172
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's not forget that veto happened, but we do have that protection in Massachusetts.

74
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Access is a different issue.

75
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:44,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've always struggled with access for the same groups of people that have struggled to get medical care in other contexts.

76
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:49,214
[SPEAKER_02]: So people without means, black and brown people, women mostly, of course.

77
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:54,976
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same groups of people that don't have the same access as, you know, wealthier, more privileged.

78
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:01,338
[SPEAKER_02]: groups of people and so we struggle with that access, I think we still have more work to do in Massachusetts.

79
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:05,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, there's a new coalition that's now called beyond row coalition.

80
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:14,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're fighting for those things to make sure that we expand access and at this point, we need to make sure that we protect providers, because

81
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:27,332
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things we need to realize is that with the overturning of Roe and the losing of the constitutional protection, it's also a mass criminalization of abortion.

82
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:27,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

83
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:35,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know that other states are going to try to prohibit people from leaving their state and coming here for abortions.

84
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:40,764
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does that mean for those people getting abortions here, for those people providing abortions here?

85
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:41,845
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to make sure we

86
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:49,208
[SPEAKER_02]: protect providers in the state and protect people who are coming to seek care in our state but may live somewhere else.

87
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's still a lot more work to do.

88
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:56,550
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a person who needs an abortion now, please do reach out.

89
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:03,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Planned Parenthood is the best place to go in Massachusetts right now to get you set up to visit a provider.

90
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: If your doctor can't help you at the moment, Planned Parenthood is a really great resource.

91
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:17,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've had, in sort of like grappling with all that's happening, I've had kind of two larger thoughts.

92
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:39,260
[SPEAKER_01]: One being the kind of relationship between regulating abortion and or birth control and sort of a raw capitalism to view the female body as a driving product force that maintains a lower class, that maintains a pipeline to military capacity, that maintains

93
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:49,911
[SPEAKER_01]: sheep, a working class, the whole nine, and wondering where and when folks are having conversations that are saying as much.

94
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:59,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you have thoughts or you've seen materials that are commenting either in support or against that kind of line of thought.

95
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:09,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me make sure I understand the thinking about, I guess, the economic part of this, right?

96
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:17,521
[SPEAKER_02]: and the disproportionate impact, of course, that this has on people of lower economic means.

97
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:24,124
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess, are you asking like, you know, is this going to create some sort of an industry or is there?

98
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:27,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my mind goes to the sort of term baby factory.

99
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:34,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that, if women have access to deciding when they become parents, then their capacity for

100
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:42,626
[SPEAKER_01]: education and higher earning and whatever self-driven choices may be is much higher.

101
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:44,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

102
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:48,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is something that was completely missing from the Supreme Court majority opinion.

103
00:08:49,375 --> 00:09:04,862
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't any talk on the impact of this decision on women's capacity to lead full lives, women's capacity to be part of both the economic, cultural fabric of society.

104
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:11,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we know what happens when women don't have bodily autonomy, right, and how this impacts.

105
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:23,753
[SPEAKER_02]: entire families and obviously, I should say, not just women, of course, many people, including the transgender community, who, of course, of course, has been devastated by this as well.

106
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:32,559
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have seen the impact on women's liberation, on women's capacities by being forced to carry a child.

107
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,745
[SPEAKER_02]: term to give birth to a child, to use their body in that way, and to most of the time raise that child, right?

108
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:45,169
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely missing from the analysis and the Supreme Court's majority opinion.

109
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,032
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of talk about the fetus.

110
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:52,455
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of talk about a potential human, a potential life, as they call it.

111
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:58,280
[SPEAKER_02]: No talk about the impact of this is that it means

112
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:05,475
[SPEAKER_02]: forced work of labor, of carrying a child on people's bodies.

113
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:07,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's missing.

114
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:12,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that has been one of the greatest, you know, sort of even just the legal critiques of this opinion.

115
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:13,199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

116
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,861
[SPEAKER_01]: You used the term bodily autonomy.

117
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:21,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Another piece that's been on my mind is I'm hearing so many stories of

118
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:23,344
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the what ifs.

119
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this rape?

120
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:27,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this some sort of medical issue?

121
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:28,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it IVF?

122
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:41,209
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to disparage those pieces because they are so relevant, but my mind also is thinking about a woman's right not to share that.

123
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:50,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I said I wanted an abortion and that's what I'm doing and I'm not needing to offer validation to sort of satisfy an outside energy.

124
00:10:52,812 --> 00:11:04,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And thinking about the ways that there are no regulations for men's bodies and there is never a time that they have to explain away independent bodily choice, as you know.

125
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:11,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm appreciating the term bodily autonomy because it feels like there's so many spaces where we're asked to say, to explain why.

126
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:14,459
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something I've thought about before.

127
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:19,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And my primary job is working with survivors of sexual trauma.

128
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:38,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And that idea of having to prove sexual assault, I don't know what the majority opinion says about this, but if there's exceptions for rape and incest, having to prove that in order to get an abortion, and how we know it's hard to prove just general incest.

129
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:43,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, and I mean, talk about traumatizing and re-traumatizing somebody to prove that.

130
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:52,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what we should be clear about is that this Supreme Court decision opens the door to not even having those exceptions.

131
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:57,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So those exceptions, if they exist, are going to be defined by state legislatures.

132
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,204
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to say, in the case of rape or incest or assault, abortion will be allowed, and they will define.

133
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And who is that?

134
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:07,426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's elected officials.

135
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:10,188
[SPEAKER_02]: It's politicians who are, you know,

136
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:17,709
[SPEAKER_02]: responding to whatever pressures are on them from their constituents or their lobbyists, they will define those terms.

137
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:21,210
[SPEAKER_02]: But some, we've already seen, will completely ban it.

138
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,091
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if it's rape incest.

139
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:26,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if it's prior to 15 weeks.

140
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:30,952
[SPEAKER_02]: They now are able to have a full out ban on abortion.

141
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:35,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

142
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:52,729
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the questions Danielle and I have thought about is what are steps that folks can be taking to that person who says this feels so large and so overwhelming, I'm not even sure what me and my person or me and my own family can be doing.

143
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:57,211
[SPEAKER_01]: I think personally, I'd also like to add to that, what can men be doing?

144
00:12:57,231 --> 00:13:00,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like birth control harangues the wrong body.

145
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,855
[SPEAKER_01]: or just birth control ranks among money.

146
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:14,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, do you have advice, thoughts on that mind who would like to contribute and isn't really sure how?

147
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:19,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there are many short term things we can do and long term things we can do.

148
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:25,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in the short term, it is supporting those states where abortion is being panned.

149
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:34,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So donating to the abortion fund for the states where that's still available, for example, donating to any organizations doing transportation.

150
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:39,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that may become illegal at some point, and we're going to have to continue to fight that.

151
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:41,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Donating to the organizations

152
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:47,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you plan parenthood who are doing the work so that's that's very short term.

153
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:58,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the short term, I think being local, being active, being out there on the street, we saw record turn out on the street opinion.

154
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after it came out.

155
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:04,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, judges don't live in a vacuum.

156
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:07,029
[SPEAKER_02]: They say that they're just interpreting the law.

157
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:16,632
[SPEAKER_02]: We see the wide spectrum of the way that you can interpret the way that you can interpret the Constitution itself.

158
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:19,192
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't make those decisions in the vacuum.

159
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:27,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So to the extent that we can be vocal and show that we are against this, I think that's really important, both in the short term and the long term.

160
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:35,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And then long-term, I think we need to have some very hard discussions about what this movement looks like in the long run.

161
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:41,639
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to, you know, the anti-choice activists did not stop in 1973.

162
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,085
[SPEAKER_02]: They organized and it was a 50-year battle for them that they are at this moment winning.

163
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,027
[SPEAKER_02]: What does our 50-year battle look like?

164
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,689
[SPEAKER_02]: What is our 50-year plan?

165
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,131
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we change public opinion?

166
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:59,974
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because even the majority of the public is in favor of abortion.

167
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,615
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we make that overwhelming?

168
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:03,576
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we change public opinion?

169
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:14,262
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we elect legislators, presidents, mayors, every elected position who is who are going to defend and promote and protect and expand abortion rights?

170
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,743
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that 50 year fight look like?

171
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:19,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, having those very hard conversations?

172
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:22,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm with you.

173
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:29,978
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a divisiveness in the left that does not lend to, like in Audre Lorde, revolution is not a one-time event.

174
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:38,449
[SPEAKER_01]: That just because there are wins doesn't mean that those can be solidified without further thought.

175
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:56,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just because people who are, you know, in, in cities, people who are more liberal, we think a lot and we see connections between right so maybe we won't vote for a pro choice elected official because they're really bad on other issues.

176
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:57,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a bad thing.

177
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,861
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's good that we think about intersectionality.

178
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:02,583
[SPEAKER_02]: It does make the work harder.

179
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:14,012
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if we name it and we, you know, we prioritize this issue, which is now clearly a priority, it's something that we're just going to need to be doing for the next few decades.

180
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:24,102
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the leaving these decisions up to the states, it makes me wonder, like, what are there other things that we need to be paying attention to?

181
00:16:24,162 --> 00:16:29,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there other things that like potentially could be threatened by this move?

182
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:31,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

183
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:38,629
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the moment for me that solidified that fear was reading Justice Thomas's concurrent.

184
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:47,597
[SPEAKER_02]: He very clearly, it's a very short concurrence or anybody who wants to read it very clearly said, actually I think this doesn't go far enough.

185
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:58,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this whole doctrine called substantive due process, which is just, you know, it's a legal term, but it's the sort of basis for a lot of the rights that we have.

186
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:08,794
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that it's something that was not maybe named in the original constitution, but that, you know, you do have these rights to like your bodily autonomy.

187
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:12,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And this includes things like same-sex marriage and includes things like,

188
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:21,261
[SPEAKER_02]: a homosexual sex, like actual intimacy between partners, that was the Lawrence decision, and includes things like contraception.

189
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:26,022
[SPEAKER_02]: He is ready to go after all of those, and he said so in his concurrence.

190
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:29,223
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I actually think this whole doctrine should not exist.

191
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:30,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's fake.

192
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:36,364
[SPEAKER_02]: And we should revisit all of those rights in upcoming decisions.

193
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,205
[SPEAKER_02]: The majority didn't say that.

194
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,245
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, no, no, no, we're just talking about abortion.

195
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:41,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Abortion is different.

196
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:43,366
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because of this thing called potential life.

197
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,309
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, that's also what they said before they got confirmed.

198
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:47,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

199
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:52,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So the you know, the justices in the dissent don't believe them.

200
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:57,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Justice Thomas is clear that he wants to go further.

201
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:00,740
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they're going to come after LGBTQ rights.

202
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to come after gender affirming care.

203
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:06,084
[SPEAKER_02]: That is top on their list.

204
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:06,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

205
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:11,469
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want, you know, especially people under 18 to receive this care.

206
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,511
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to come after contraception.

207
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:19,097
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know where this ends, which is why the long term fight is so important.

208
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:27,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think in Massachusetts, we are in a good position because our advocates have been so strong and have pushed our

209
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:32,889
[SPEAKER_02]: state legislature to be progressive on these issues.

210
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,310
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's way more work to be done.

211
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,113
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to protect these in Massachusetts and then we have to help our states around us.

212
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:52,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, while you're speaking, I'm thinking, does that create a space where Massachusetts could function as sort of a template or a model for what other states could be looking to do?

213
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there places where we're documenting wins and thinking about how we could improve?

214
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,416
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, like, how do those details maybe get shared with folks?

215
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:05,860
[SPEAKER_01]: And by folks, probably I mean me first, so I can be more educated.

216
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:07,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

217
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:17,370
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, the map right now is in chaos because, you know, if you if you look right now, if you Google what are the states that have banned abortion, that may be different a week ago than today.

218
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:24,394
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the conservatives are filing legislation and lawsuits all over the country.

219
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:27,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are being hashed out in state legislatures, in courts.

220
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:32,998
[SPEAKER_02]: The sort of map of rights is in total disarray right now.

221
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:38,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to be vigilant about these things that we care about in all the states.

222
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,201
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I'm jumping all over the place.

223
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:47,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have thoughts on the optics of, I mean, I think last week was just

224
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:58,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of insane, but the optics of the existing court talking about, like, nominations to seats or taking seats moving as fast as they did just before.

225
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:03,129
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on boarded or is on boarded.

226
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:10,234
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's there is some talk of adding seats to the Supreme Court.

227
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:12,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem like that is real.

228
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:17,657
[SPEAKER_02]: That is that actually has any possibilities in this current Congress.

229
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:27,182
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's I think some people on the left have been talking about this a lot like, OK, well, let's just add some more seats in the Supreme Court and pack it right.

230
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't see that happening under a Biden administration.

231
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:38,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's going to be about replacing some of these justices as they retire.

232
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,982
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but that's, but they're very young, right?

233
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:42,542
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very young.

234
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:43,802
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be on there for 10, 20, 30 more years.

235
00:20:49,925 --> 00:21:01,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, do you have thoughts on Justice Ginsburg, the way that she managed her ending, as opposed to making space for a different justice to take a seat before this Trump shift?

236
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,794
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's one of the last questions, because that's a big one.

237
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:13,580
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nobody can fault a person who has worked so hard around their life to say, OK, this is my moment.

238
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:14,888
[SPEAKER_02]: to leave.

239
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:20,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, that was her personal decision to make.

240
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,970
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, obviously she was a champion of all these rights.

241
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

242
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:25,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

243
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

244
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, before leaving.

245
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:36,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'm so grateful to you.

246
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:37,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Danielle is too.

247
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:42,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I clearly this conversation just is exists in concentric circles of thought.

248
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:51,038
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna be mindful of time and ask you maybe if you have any last final comments, thoughts before we wrap up.

249
00:21:51,618 --> 00:22:11,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I feel like this conversation could look different in a few months and hopefully for a better reason, but it's hard to, I find myself, it's being hard to sort of remain optimistic, but I really appreciate you giving us all these insights and hopefully we can continue this conversation in the future.

250
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:20,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just say that if people wanna get involved locally, the website is massbeyondrow.com.

251
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,083
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's M-A-S-S beyond R-O-E.com.

252
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,845
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a coalition that's being built now.

253
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:32,549
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you wanna get involved, receive the updates, that's a great place to be so far.

254
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:39,295
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Planned Parenthood, Reproductive Equity Now, and ACLU that are the anchors of that coalition.

255
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,917
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope more will join.

256
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:47,539
[SPEAKER_02]: and make that coalition stronger, make sure that we have many voices at the table.

257
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:51,100
[SPEAKER_02]: And donate to abortion funds.

258
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Abortion funds around the country are really struggling right now to meet demands.

259
00:22:57,922 --> 00:23:01,283
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're able to do that, it's a really great way to get involved right now.

260
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:04,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

261
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:05,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

262
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:08,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me.

263
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,581
