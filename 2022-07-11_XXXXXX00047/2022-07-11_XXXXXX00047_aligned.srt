1
00:00:04,343 --> 00:00:05,424
Hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:07,846
I'm super excited to present today's episode.

3
00:00:08,247 --> 00:00:12,490
Before I get to the interview, I wanted to announce that the Medford Family Network Gala is back.

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:18,336
The night under 10,000 lights is scheduled for Saturday, September 10th at Wright's Pond from 6 to 10 p.m.

5
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,439
Tickets and sponsorship opportunities are still available.

6
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,102
Check out the link in today's show notes to find out more.

7
00:00:25,923 --> 00:00:27,024
Hope you enjoy the interview.

8
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:35,696
All right, thanks, everybody, for joining us today.

9
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:41,540
If we could just start by having our guests introduce yourself with your name and pronouns and just a bit about who you are.

10
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,983
So hi, my name is Laura Rotolo.

11
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:47,704
I also pronounce it Laura.

12
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,746
Thank you so much for having me here.

13
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,827
I'm she, her, hers.

14
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:53,108
I live in Medford.

15
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,189
I am a lawyer and advocate.

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,912
I work currently at the ACLU of Massachusetts.

17
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:02,954
the American Civil Liberties Union, where I am a field director.

18
00:01:03,014 --> 00:01:11,779
So I lead our organizers, lobbyists, and political advocates in all of the work that the ACLU does.

19
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:14,521
So my base is in immigrants' rights.

20
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:16,682
I'm an immigrant myself from Argentina.

21
00:01:17,483 --> 00:01:24,387
And most of my career has been defending and protecting and promoting immigrants' rights in the United States.

22
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:29,690
But currently, I lead a team of advocates that work on a variety of civil rights issues.

23
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:35,934
I'm a mom, two kids in Medford, and I live near Wrights Pond.

24
00:01:35,974 --> 00:01:37,575
Oh, that's sweet.

25
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:38,936
I live near Wrights Pond as well.

26
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:51,705
So before we get into our rather serious topic today, I'll ask you the question that I ask everybody on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

27
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,246
My go-to is Tenocht.

28
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:54,823
And do you have a favorite?

29
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:55,844
Once a week, probably.

30
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:57,745
When you're at dinner, too.

31
00:01:57,905 --> 00:01:59,106
My kids love it.

32
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,148
It's a favorite of everyone's.

33
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,949
Do you have a favorite item on the menu?

34
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:06,671
My favorite is the tortas, which is the sandwiches.

35
00:02:07,412 --> 00:02:09,253
But we also get burritos and burrito bowls.

36
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:10,394
Thank you.

37
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:11,194
All right.

38
00:02:11,414 --> 00:02:15,177
And I'll mention just Shelly is here co-hosting with me today.

39
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:16,417
Shelly here.

40
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,660
And you might hear my voice is a little gone.

41
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,922
So I'm going to lean on Shelly today to do a lot of the interviewing.

42
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:24,623
I'll pass it to you.

43
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:25,703
So let's get into it.

44
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:36,450
I think to start, maybe Laura, you could speak to some of the ways that the recent overturning of Roe has impacted you in the immediate sort of professional world that you move in.

45
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,374
So the overturning of Roe v. Wade was

46
00:02:42,398 --> 00:02:46,801
On the one hand, well, it's monumental, historic, devastating.

47
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:52,704
There's no overstating the impact that this is going to have on millions of people in the country.

48
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:59,988
Because we got that bizarre sneak peek in May, it gave us a little bit of time to organize.

49
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,352
But it also gave us a little bit of pause that maybe perhaps this wasn't going to happen.

50
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:15,817
But then, of course, we saw just very recently that the Supreme Court did go ahead and overturn Roe versus Wade, ending the federal constitutional right to an abortion.

51
00:03:16,837 --> 00:03:18,038
I think it is.

52
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:24,541
Many of us felt we said these words to each other, my friends and I said, we feel like we've been punched in the stomach.

53
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:25,542
It was a very.

54
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:33,585
physical feeling that morning where I don't remember my physical reaction, but I remember my kids came to me and said, mom, you just screamed.

55
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:36,587
Then you put your head down and you didn't move for a long time.

56
00:03:36,647 --> 00:03:37,827
And we said, what is happening?

57
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:52,434
And I think a lot of us felt that way, that after 50 years of believing that we had made progress, that we had this constitutional protection to bodily autonomy that was ripped out from under us.

58
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:52,494
So

59
00:03:53,795 --> 00:04:05,081
I think we're all still reeling in that very emotional reaction and at the same time getting ready for the work that is coming at us very quickly now.

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,783
Yes, I share the visceral reaction that maybe you and others had.

61
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:17,006
My daughter and I were lucky enough to see you speak at the abortion rally with Maura Healey.

62
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:26,172
And one of the comments that was made was sort of, you know, not to worry, abortions will be protected in the state of Massachusetts.

63
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:31,435
And so my mind sort of went to, well, you know, what does that mean?

64
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:33,156
Is that really true?

65
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:36,117
If there's fear around, like, can this really happen at the federal level?

66
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,318
What does that mean for state level?

67
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:50,125
And then, yeah, maybe if you could speak to thoughts around abortion security in Massachusetts, and then maybe even what it might mean here at home in Medford and for folks needing birth control options locally.

68
00:04:52,082 --> 00:05:02,868
Absolutely, and I think we can still feel good that abortion is legal in Massachusetts, to this day, and there's no sense that it will go away anytime soon.

69
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:05,409
So that is all correct.

70
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:16,703
What the advocates in Massachusetts did was to make sure that a year ago, the state legislature enshrined that protection into statute.

71
00:05:16,763 --> 00:05:20,745
And so we have, we call it the Roe Act that was passed.

72
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:25,449
It was vetoed by Governor Baker, but the legislature was able to override that veto.

73
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:31,172
So let's not forget that veto happened, but we do have that protection in Massachusetts.

74
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,335
Access is a different issue.

75
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:44,033
And we've always struggled with access for the same groups of people that have struggled to get medical care in other contexts.

76
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:49,214
So people without means, black and brown people, women mostly, of course.

77
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:54,976
And it's the same groups of people that don't have the same access as, you know, wealthier, more privileged.

78
00:05:55,856 --> 00:06:01,338
groups of people and so we struggle with that access, I think we still have more work to do in Massachusetts.

79
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:05,979
Currently, there's a new coalition that's now called beyond row coalition.

80
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:14,981
And we're fighting for those things to make sure that we expand access and at this point, we need to make sure that we protect providers, because

81
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:27,332
I think one of the things we need to realize is that with the overturning of Roe and the losing of the constitutional protection, it's also a mass criminalization of abortion.

82
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:27,973
Yes.

83
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:35,279
So we know that other states are going to try to prohibit people from leaving their state and coming here for abortions.

84
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:40,764
And what does that mean for those people getting abortions here, for those people providing abortions here?

85
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:41,845
We need to make sure we

86
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:49,208
protect providers in the state and protect people who are coming to seek care in our state but may live somewhere else.

87
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,508
And so there's still a lot more work to do.

88
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:56,550
If you are a person who needs an abortion now, please do reach out.

89
00:06:57,371 --> 00:07:03,553
Planned Parenthood is the best place to go in Massachusetts right now to get you set up to visit a provider.

90
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:09,375
If your doctor can't help you at the moment, Planned Parenthood is a really great resource.

91
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:17,992
Yeah, I've had, in sort of like grappling with all that's happening, I've had kind of two larger thoughts.

92
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:39,260
One being the kind of relationship between regulating abortion and or birth control and sort of a raw capitalism to view the female body as a driving product force that maintains a lower class, that maintains a pipeline to military capacity, that maintains

93
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:49,911
sheep, a working class, the whole nine, and wondering where and when folks are having conversations that are saying as much.

94
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:59,936
I don't know if you have thoughts or you've seen materials that are commenting either in support or against that kind of line of thought.

95
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:09,099
Let me make sure I understand the thinking about, I guess, the economic part of this, right?

96
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:17,521
and the disproportionate impact, of course, that this has on people of lower economic means.

97
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:24,124
And I guess, are you asking like, you know, is this going to create some sort of an industry or is there?

98
00:08:24,264 --> 00:08:27,545
I think my mind goes to the sort of term baby factory.

99
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:34,128
And in that, if women have access to deciding when they become parents, then their capacity for

100
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:42,626
education and higher earning and whatever self-driven choices may be is much higher.

101
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:44,332
Absolutely.

102
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:48,834
And that is something that was completely missing from the Supreme Court majority opinion.

103
00:08:49,375 --> 00:09:04,862
There wasn't any talk on the impact of this decision on women's capacity to lead full lives, women's capacity to be part of both the economic, cultural fabric of society.

104
00:09:04,922 --> 00:09:11,985
I mean, I think we know what happens when women don't have bodily autonomy, right, and how this impacts.

105
00:09:12,445 --> 00:09:23,753
entire families and obviously, I should say, not just women, of course, many people, including the transgender community, who, of course, of course, has been devastated by this as well.

106
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:32,559
But we have seen the impact on women's liberation, on women's capacities by being forced to carry a child.

107
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,745
term to give birth to a child, to use their body in that way, and to most of the time raise that child, right?

108
00:09:40,265 --> 00:09:45,169
It's completely missing from the analysis and the Supreme Court's majority opinion.

109
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,032
There's a lot of talk about the fetus.

110
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:52,455
There's a lot of talk about a potential human, a potential life, as they call it.

111
00:09:53,256 --> 00:09:58,280
No talk about the impact of this is that it means

112
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:05,475
forced work of labor, of carrying a child on people's bodies.

113
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:07,316
And that's missing.

114
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:12,379
I think that has been one of the greatest, you know, sort of even just the legal critiques of this opinion.

115
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:13,199
Yes.

116
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,861
You used the term bodily autonomy.

117
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:21,464
Another piece that's been on my mind is I'm hearing so many stories of

118
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:23,344
you know, the what ifs.

119
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:24,385
Was this rape?

120
00:10:24,685 --> 00:10:27,225
Is this some sort of medical issue?

121
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:28,786
Is it IVF?

122
00:10:28,886 --> 00:10:41,209
And not to disparage those pieces because they are so relevant, but my mind also is thinking about a woman's right not to share that.

123
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:50,212
Like, I said I wanted an abortion and that's what I'm doing and I'm not needing to offer validation to sort of satisfy an outside energy.

124
00:10:52,812 --> 00:11:04,596
And thinking about the ways that there are no regulations for men's bodies and there is never a time that they have to explain away independent bodily choice, as you know.

125
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:11,458
Yeah, I'm appreciating the term bodily autonomy because it feels like there's so many spaces where we're asked to say, to explain why.

126
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:14,459
That's not something I've thought about before.

127
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:19,422
And my primary job is working with survivors of sexual trauma.

128
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:38,093
And that idea of having to prove sexual assault, I don't know what the majority opinion says about this, but if there's exceptions for rape and incest, having to prove that in order to get an abortion, and how we know it's hard to prove just general incest.

129
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:43,553
Right, and I mean, talk about traumatizing and re-traumatizing somebody to prove that.

130
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:52,498
But I think what we should be clear about is that this Supreme Court decision opens the door to not even having those exceptions.

131
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:57,180
So those exceptions, if they exist, are going to be defined by state legislatures.

132
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:04,204
They're going to say, in the case of rape or incest or assault, abortion will be allowed, and they will define.

133
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,765
And who is that?

134
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:07,426
It's elected officials.

135
00:12:07,546 --> 00:12:10,188
It's politicians who are, you know,

136
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:17,709
responding to whatever pressures are on them from their constituents or their lobbyists, they will define those terms.

137
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:21,210
But some, we've already seen, will completely ban it.

138
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,091
It doesn't matter if it's rape incest.

139
00:12:24,391 --> 00:12:26,471
It doesn't matter if it's prior to 15 weeks.

140
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:30,952
They now are able to have a full out ban on abortion.

141
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:35,253
Yeah.

142
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:52,729
One of the questions Danielle and I have thought about is what are steps that folks can be taking to that person who says this feels so large and so overwhelming, I'm not even sure what me and my person or me and my own family can be doing.

143
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:57,211
I think personally, I'd also like to add to that, what can men be doing?

144
00:12:57,231 --> 00:13:00,013
I feel like birth control harangues the wrong body.

145
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,855
or just birth control ranks among money.

146
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:14,140
And so, yeah, do you have advice, thoughts on that mind who would like to contribute and isn't really sure how?

147
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:19,387
I think there are many short term things we can do and long term things we can do.

148
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:25,350
So I think in the short term, it is supporting those states where abortion is being panned.

149
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:34,634
So donating to the abortion fund for the states where that's still available, for example, donating to any organizations doing transportation.

150
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:39,156
Of course, that may become illegal at some point, and we're going to have to continue to fight that.

151
00:13:39,976 --> 00:13:41,077
Donating to the organizations

152
00:13:41,717 --> 00:13:47,964
Like, you plan parenthood who are doing the work so that's that's very short term.

153
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:58,635
And in the short term, I think being local, being active, being out there on the street, we saw record turn out on the street opinion.

154
00:13:58,735 --> 00:14:00,356
And then after it came out.

155
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:04,328
And, you know, judges don't live in a vacuum.

156
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:07,029
They say that they're just interpreting the law.

157
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:16,632
We see the wide spectrum of the way that you can interpret the way that you can interpret the Constitution itself.

158
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:19,192
They don't make those decisions in the vacuum.

159
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:27,815
So to the extent that we can be vocal and show that we are against this, I think that's really important, both in the short term and the long term.

160
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:35,494
And then long-term, I think we need to have some very hard discussions about what this movement looks like in the long run.

161
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:41,639
How are we going to, you know, the anti-choice activists did not stop in 1973.

162
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,085
They organized and it was a 50-year battle for them that they are at this moment winning.

163
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:51,027
What does our 50-year battle look like?

164
00:14:51,427 --> 00:14:53,689
What is our 50-year plan?

165
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,131
How do we change public opinion?

166
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:59,974
No, because even the majority of the public is in favor of abortion.

167
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,615
How do we make that overwhelming?

168
00:15:02,495 --> 00:15:03,576
How do we change public opinion?

169
00:15:03,656 --> 00:15:14,262
How do we elect legislators, presidents, mayors, every elected position who is who are going to defend and promote and protect and expand abortion rights?

170
00:15:14,962 --> 00:15:16,743
What does that 50 year fight look like?

171
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:19,985
And, you know, having those very hard conversations?

172
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:22,828
Yeah, I'm with you.

173
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:29,978
I think there's a divisiveness in the left that does not lend to, like in Audre Lorde, revolution is not a one-time event.

174
00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:38,449
That just because there are wins doesn't mean that those can be solidified without further thought.

175
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:56,197
That's just because people who are, you know, in, in cities, people who are more liberal, we think a lot and we see connections between right so maybe we won't vote for a pro choice elected official because they're really bad on other issues.

176
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:57,739
And that's not a bad thing.

177
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,861
You know, it's good that we think about intersectionality.

178
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:02,583
It does make the work harder.

179
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:14,012
But I think if we name it and we, you know, we prioritize this issue, which is now clearly a priority, it's something that we're just going to need to be doing for the next few decades.

180
00:16:15,898 --> 00:16:24,102
But I think the leaving these decisions up to the states, it makes me wonder, like, what are there other things that we need to be paying attention to?

181
00:16:24,162 --> 00:16:29,865
Are there other things that like potentially could be threatened by this move?

182
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:31,926
Absolutely.

183
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:38,629
And I think the moment for me that solidified that fear was reading Justice Thomas's concurrent.

184
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:47,597
He very clearly, it's a very short concurrence or anybody who wants to read it very clearly said, actually I think this doesn't go far enough.

185
00:16:48,595 --> 00:16:58,805
I think that this whole doctrine called substantive due process, which is just, you know, it's a legal term, but it's the sort of basis for a lot of the rights that we have.

186
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:08,794
It means that it's something that was not maybe named in the original constitution, but that, you know, you do have these rights to like your bodily autonomy.

187
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:12,818
And this includes things like same-sex marriage and includes things like,

188
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:21,261
a homosexual sex, like actual intimacy between partners, that was the Lawrence decision, and includes things like contraception.

189
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:26,022
He is ready to go after all of those, and he said so in his concurrence.

190
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:29,223
He said, I actually think this whole doctrine should not exist.

191
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:30,343
I think it's fake.

192
00:17:31,263 --> 00:17:36,364
And we should revisit all of those rights in upcoming decisions.

193
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,205
The majority didn't say that.

194
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,245
They said, no, no, no, we're just talking about abortion.

195
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:41,125
Abortion is different.

196
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:43,366
It's because of this thing called potential life.

197
00:17:44,266 --> 00:17:47,309
But I mean, that's also what they said before they got confirmed.

198
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:47,609
Right.

199
00:17:47,669 --> 00:17:52,153
So the you know, the justices in the dissent don't believe them.

200
00:17:52,913 --> 00:17:57,357
And, you know, Justice Thomas is clear that he wants to go further.

201
00:17:57,697 --> 00:18:00,740
So I think they're going to come after LGBTQ rights.

202
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,802
They're going to come after gender affirming care.

203
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:06,084
That is top on their list.

204
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:06,204
Right.

205
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:11,469
They don't want, you know, especially people under 18 to receive this care.

206
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,511
They're going to come after contraception.

207
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:19,097
We don't know where this ends, which is why the long term fight is so important.

208
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:27,865
Again, I think in Massachusetts, we are in a good position because our advocates have been so strong and have pushed our

209
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:32,889
state legislature to be progressive on these issues.

210
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,310
But there's way more work to be done.

211
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,113
We have to protect these in Massachusetts and then we have to help our states around us.

212
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:52,869
Yeah, while you're speaking, I'm thinking, does that create a space where Massachusetts could function as sort of a template or a model for what other states could be looking to do?

213
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,233
Are there places where we're documenting wins and thinking about how we could improve?

214
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:01,416
And then, like, how do those details maybe get shared with folks?

215
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:05,860
And by folks, probably I mean me first, so I can be more educated.

216
00:19:07,463 --> 00:19:07,623
Yeah.

217
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:17,370
And to be honest, the map right now is in chaos because, you know, if you if you look right now, if you Google what are the states that have banned abortion, that may be different a week ago than today.

218
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:24,394
You know, the conservatives are filing legislation and lawsuits all over the country.

219
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:27,996
Those are being hashed out in state legislatures, in courts.

220
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:32,998
The sort of map of rights is in total disarray right now.

221
00:19:33,878 --> 00:19:38,059
So we have to be vigilant about these things that we care about in all the states.

222
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,201
I'm sorry, I'm jumping all over the place.

223
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:47,122
Do you have thoughts on the optics of, I mean, I think last week was just

224
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:58,964
Kind of insane, but the optics of the existing court talking about, like, nominations to seats or taking seats moving as fast as they did just before.

225
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:03,129
It was on boarded or is on boarded.

226
00:20:05,952 --> 00:20:10,234
So, you know, there's there is some talk of adding seats to the Supreme Court.

227
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:12,695
It doesn't seem like that is real.

228
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:17,657
That is that actually has any possibilities in this current Congress.

229
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:27,182
You know, there's I think some people on the left have been talking about this a lot like, OK, well, let's just add some more seats in the Supreme Court and pack it right.

230
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,959
I don't, I don't see that happening under a Biden administration.

231
00:20:32,939 --> 00:20:38,461
So, you know, it's going to be about replacing some of these justices as they retire.

232
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:41,982
You know, but that's, but they're very young, right?

233
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:42,542
They're very young.

234
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:43,802
They can be on there for 10, 20, 30 more years.

235
00:20:49,925 --> 00:21:01,572
Yeah, do you have thoughts on Justice Ginsburg, the way that she managed her ending, as opposed to making space for a different justice to take a seat before this Trump shift?

236
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,794
And maybe that's one of the last questions, because that's a big one.

237
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:13,580
You know, nobody can fault a person who has worked so hard around their life to say, OK, this is my moment.

238
00:21:14,428 --> 00:21:14,888
to leave.

239
00:21:15,068 --> 00:21:20,429
I think that, you know, that was her personal decision to make.

240
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,970
You know, obviously she was a champion of all these rights.

241
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,310
I'm sorry.

242
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:25,910
Yeah.

243
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,370
Yeah.

244
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,491
Before, before leaving.

245
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:36,032
So, yeah, I'm so grateful to you.

246
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:37,312
I know Danielle is too.

247
00:21:37,432 --> 00:21:42,133
I clearly this conversation just is exists in concentric circles of thought.

248
00:21:44,157 --> 00:21:51,038
I wanna be mindful of time and ask you maybe if you have any last final comments, thoughts before we wrap up.

249
00:21:51,618 --> 00:22:11,802
Yeah, I feel like this conversation could look different in a few months and hopefully for a better reason, but it's hard to, I find myself, it's being hard to sort of remain optimistic, but I really appreciate you giving us all these insights and hopefully we can continue this conversation in the future.

250
00:22:14,135 --> 00:22:20,440
And I'll just say that if people wanna get involved locally, the website is massbeyondrow.com.

251
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,083
So it's M-A-S-S beyond R-O-E.com.

252
00:22:24,123 --> 00:22:26,845
There's a coalition that's being built now.

253
00:22:26,865 --> 00:22:32,549
And so if you wanna get involved, receive the updates, that's a great place to be so far.

254
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:39,295
That is Planned Parenthood, Reproductive Equity Now, and ACLU that are the anchors of that coalition.

255
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,917
And I hope more will join.

256
00:22:42,677 --> 00:22:47,539
and make that coalition stronger, make sure that we have many voices at the table.

257
00:22:49,199 --> 00:22:51,100
And donate to abortion funds.

258
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,222
Abortion funds around the country are really struggling right now to meet demands.

259
00:22:57,922 --> 00:23:01,283
If you're able to do that, it's a really great way to get involved right now.

260
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:04,744
Thank you so much.

261
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:05,664
Thank you.

262
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:08,665
Thank you so much for having me.

263
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,581
