Yes.

36
00:02:12,643 --> 00:02:12,703

37
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:12,843

00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:13,083
Yes.

39
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:13,363
Yes.

40
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:13,443
Yes.

41
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:14,224
Yes.

42
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:14,324
Yes.

43
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:14,704
Yes.

44
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:15,064
Yes.

45
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:31,470
I'd be happy to take Mr. Delfano's appointment as well.

46
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,653
However, I was a little concerned about that appropriation.

47
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:42,517
I've listened to Councilor Caviella now for the past five weeks, every morning at breakfast, talk about how he's been trying to get that released from the city solicitors office.

48
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,178
So I'm glad to see it go.

49
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:46,020
Thank you.

50
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:53,264
On the motion of Vice President Behrs to take up 22-286 out of order, all those second by- Second.

51
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:54,785
Councilor Caviella, all those in favor?

52
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:55,206
Aye.

53
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:56,086
All those opposed?

54
00:02:56,106 --> 00:02:57,147
Motion passes.

55
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:06,729
To the Honorable President and members of Medford City Council, Medford Mass License Commission appointment that we did get this paper last week, it was tabled, I will read it once more.

56
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:18,274
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm the appointment of Robert Delafano, 46, you have the License Commission for a term to expire June 1st, 2028.

57
00:03:18,314 --> 00:03:24,237
Robert will be present via Zoom and a copy of Robert's Resume Appointment Letter are attached.

58
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:26,266
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

59
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:27,907
Sincerely, Bernadette O'Connor, Mayor.

60
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:42,851
We did last week, in addition to the motion to table this, we had a discussion that Mr. Delifano did not need to attend, and we were hoping, or we asked a member of the administration to speak about the appointment so that we could consider it.

61
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:45,251
Vice President Berry.

62
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,192
Thank you, Madam President.

63
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:51,806
Is who from the administration is here to speak?

64
00:03:52,187 --> 00:04:01,654
I guess my question is not actually on the appointment of the licensing commission, but the reason it was tabled was to discuss whether appointments were made to, or were going to be made to the board of registrars.

65
00:04:03,715 --> 00:04:16,005
I'm seeing that there are not appointments here on our agenda, so that no permanent appointments have been suggested, but are there, basically, is there someone from the administration who could speak to what's happening with appointments to the boards of registrars?

66
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:32,302
I am not seeing anyone on the call.

67
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:35,204
I see Alicia Hunt, but she's not out.

68
00:04:35,224 --> 00:04:36,265
She should be there for that.

69
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:56,207
Well, I think I was, I'd just like to know whether appointments have been made.

70
00:04:56,427 --> 00:04:59,488
I don't know if, there's no one on the call who can answer that question.

71
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:05,071
I don't see anyone from the administration on the call other than Director Hoffman would not be able to speak to that, I guess.

72
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:06,072
Okay.

73
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:12,975
I have a motion on the floor.

74
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:16,677
Motion to approve Mr. Delfano's appointment.

75
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:17,517
Second.

76
00:05:17,677 --> 00:05:18,378
Oh, Nina's here.

77
00:05:21,502 --> 00:05:30,465
We were just taking up the paper on Mr. Delapano's appointment as well as speaking about council members.

78
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:37,288
Yes, I was just wondering if we could get an update from the administration on appointments to the boards of registrars of voters for the board of registrars of voters.

79
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,328
Good evening, Madam President, members of the Council.

80
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,909
The Mayor has made three temporary appointments at this time.

81
00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:54,850
There are steps that need to be taken to ensure that the appointment process is in order before it comes to the City Council.

82
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,371
That's the short answer.

83
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:57,631
Great, thank you.

84
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:01,512
I would second Councilor Nights motion to approve Mr. Delafano's appointment.

85
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:08,653
On the motion of Councilor Nights, seconded by Vice President Behrs to approve the appointment of Mr. Delafano to the License Commission.

86
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:10,298
Yes.

87
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:10,478
Yes.

88
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:10,638
Yes.

89
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:10,859
Yes.

90
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,059
Yes.

91
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:11,419
Yes.

92
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:11,719
Yes.

93
00:06:38,457 --> 00:07:00,555
motion passes motions orders and resolutions 22-291 offered by councillor night be it so resolved that the medford city council review the administration's response to paper 2006 establishing a beautification committee tonight yes madam president thank you very much um way back in 2000 paper 20006 so this paper was actually uh

94
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:08,470
One of the first papers that was heard in the first meeting last term.

95
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:16,194
And we requested that the city solicitor's office draft us a draft ordinance to establish a beautification committee.

96
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,476
And after 30 months, we've gotten this great document here.

97
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:20,497
It's like the Magna Carta.

98
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:21,838
It's a page and a half long.

99
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:30,543
And on it, it establishes the criteria for us to establish a beautification committee here in the city of Medford.

100
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:42,863
And the purpose is to act as an advisory committee to the city and city departments to address issues that the regular citizen cares about, that regular people are concerned about, the lack of delivery of quality city services here in our community.

101
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:46,826
The curb appeal in this community now is worse than it's ever been.

102
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:50,269
I've lived in this community my whole life, and I've never, ever, ever seen it look worse.

103
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,130
I've never seen it look worse.

104
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:53,652
Our roads are in tough shape.

105
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:55,053
Our sidewalks are in tough shape.

106
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,013
There's stumps everywhere.

107
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:59,016
State-owned properties are in disrepair.

108
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:00,517
State-owned properties are sloppy.

109
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:02,566
I think a beautification committee can help us.

110
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:06,830
I think a beautification committee can help us direct where we want to see our efforts go.

111
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,573
I think a beautification committee can help us raise awareness on issues.

112
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:16,098
So the mayor's office and the mayor's lawyer has provided us with a draft of this ordinance.

113
00:08:16,138 --> 00:08:17,179
I think it needs a little bit of work.

114
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,744
I'd obviously be happy to refer it to the rules and ordinance subcommittee for us to properly vet.

115
00:08:23,325 --> 00:08:25,207
I'm looking at this document here.

116
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:34,188
It went from an advisory beautification committee established by the city council to the mayor's beautification committee that she's going to be able to appoint and remove members that are free.

117
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:37,931
Well, it's not necessarily what I was looking for.

118
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:44,295
But I think with the leadership of Chairman bears and that subcommittee will be able to come up with a document that everybody would be able to.

119
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,636
So with that being said, I'd make the motion to refer the paper to the subcommittee.

120
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:56,073
On the motion of Councilor Nietzsche to refer the paper to the rules and ordinances subcommittee, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

121
00:08:56,713 --> 00:08:57,394
All those in favor?

122
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:57,935
Aye.

123
00:08:57,955 --> 00:08:58,876
All those opposed?

124
00:08:58,896 --> 00:09:02,679
Well, it doesn't matter, that works.

125
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,942
It does not matter for that person.

126
00:09:04,982 --> 00:09:05,682
All those opposed?

127
00:09:06,083 --> 00:09:06,723
Motion passes.

128
00:09:08,536 --> 00:09:10,777
22-292 offered by Councilor Starpelli.

129
00:09:10,837 --> 00:09:16,980
Be it so resolved, the City Council commend the Recreation Department for their outstanding work with our teen offerings this past fall and winter.

130
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,603
Be it further resolved that we schedule a meeting with the recreation team at a subcommittee to discuss possible future growth dealing with programs and facilities.

131
00:09:24,803 --> 00:09:25,523
Councilor Starpelli.

132
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,264
Thank you, Madam President.

133
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:35,928
I wanted to take this time because I was getting some feedback from a bunch of teens that

134
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:41,259
know, I was with my daughter and their friends and we were talking about recreation.

135
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:48,126
And what I found amazing is that when you hear the bad things in Medford, it resonates.

136
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,288
But when you hear good things,

137
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:51,698
kind of falls in deaf ears.

138
00:09:51,858 --> 00:10:17,168
So when you hear what our recreation department's doing, probably our most neediest, most vulnerable community members, you're looking at teens that really don't have a place to go here in Medford, where other communities have bowling alleys or rec centers or boys and girls clubs where they can always have a safe place to just pop in the

139
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:33,771
The recreation department at the old high school at the recreation facility, um, has been housing a free team night where kids could just come in and drop, drop in, and they were consistently housing between 70 and 100 teens.

140
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:36,135
We never heard of an issue.

141
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:40,058
We never heard the police say that the teens are out of control.

142
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:58,691
We have seldom heard of any issues of teens walking the streets of Medford and hanging in places they shouldn't because we gave them an opportunity, something as simple as the gymnasium and the classrooms at the Chevalier and the gymnasium.

143
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:02,413
It's paying such great dividends.

144
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:04,155
And to think that

145
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:08,797
something that small has made such a huge impact.

146
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:33,062
Looking and sending this to subcommittee, which I chair and sitting down with the director and right away, I heard from the library staff that wants to get involved, knowing that we have a state of the art library and there's possibilities to do programming for teens with the library and looking at future facilities.

147
00:11:35,282 --> 00:11:55,551
The HECMA Center has come back up and talked of discussions now that there's hope that there's an arts center in our community elsewhere that we can focus on a facility that abuts a playground and it's on a bus route that our kids can find a safe haven to go any day of the week.

148
00:11:57,192 --> 00:12:02,935
But again, having a location in the middle of Meffitt Square that our

149
00:12:03,758 --> 00:12:06,861
kids and what we've seen is our most neediest kids.

150
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:25,075
Um, our Children that have either single parent or both parents have to work to survive and have nowhere to go and having that location in the middle of method square and giving them that that safe area to traverse to.

151
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,416
I think it's so important.

152
00:12:26,456 --> 00:12:32,381
So I'm so excited that this is the some of the vision that we looked at years ago when

153
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:36,080
We had our committee to put this together to see if it was viable.

154
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,923
And one of the things we talked about is sustainability.

155
00:12:40,244 --> 00:12:44,648
And we talked about recreation funding itself.

156
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:56,098
And what you're seeing with the new, we've hired now a new recreation coordinator, and that person is focused on adult programming.

157
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,100
And what you're seeing is,

158
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:08,235
no wavering in adult program fees, the numbers are through the roof, the money is coming in and it's offsetting other youth programs that really need it.

159
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:13,056
So this is exactly the vision that started years ago.

160
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:24,879
And I think it's time that we look into the possibilities of moving it forward and having another location, a standalone location,

161
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:32,378
would be an amazing opportunity for our youth and all of us here in Medford.

162
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:35,960
So I appreciate you listening to me.

163
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:45,063
And again, I congratulate our recreation director, Kevin Bailey, and his staff who are doing an amazing, amazing job.

164
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,924
I'm fortunate

165
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:59,306
to be the program developer in a recreation department where I have eight full time program coordinators, a facilities director, a full time administrative assistant and a director.

166
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:19,237
And we have over when during the summer is over 100 part time staff and about 70 of those staff members that are funded by a mass summer jobs program money that's allocated directly to help our teams work through the summer that would allow us to do great things for the kids in the community that I work in.

167
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,840
Well, this is the path that method deserves.

168
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:28,082
And I think that we have the means we have the ability to

169
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:30,709
do some great things in the next year.

170
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:46,578
And I'm hoping with the subcommittee, the input from our neighbors and our, um, our, our teams, especially because when you listen to your children, the truth is the truth comes out and then you can't, you can't hide from it.

171
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:55,143
So it's so important to hear and see the results of what the team night has met on a Friday and Saturday night and the number of kids that have participated.

172
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,604
So, um,

173
00:14:57,325 --> 00:15:23,540
Thank you for the time and I motion that we have a subcommittee to discuss possible future growth dealing with the recreation program and facilities and hope to have someone from the city administration there, also our director and any of his staff that would like to come and any other city entity that we feel that could really

174
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,368
work in collaboration with this group.

175
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:32,350
So, the library being one that we've already reached out to.

176
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,410
So, thank you.

177
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:39,112
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

178
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:40,653
Any further discussion?

179
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:49,556
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Sang to send a paper to the Recreation and Youth Affairs Subcommittee.

180
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:50,877
All those in favor?

181
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:51,597
Aye.

182
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,377
All those opposed?

183
00:15:52,838 --> 00:15:53,498
Motion passes.

184
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:58,247
22-294, offered by Vice President Beyers.

185
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:23,099
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council accepts the provisions of Mass General Law, Chapter 51, Section 16A, to create a Board of Election Commissioners, which shall have all the powers, rights, duties, and liabilities of Board of Registrars of Voters, and with respect to elections, of city and town clerks, either under general or special law, and which shall be the lawful successor of said registrars, and with respect to elections, said clerk.

186
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:25,536
Thank you, Madam President.

187
00:16:25,856 --> 00:16:50,665
We've been discussing this since, I believe, our first meeting of this, uh, year, and this would, as we've discussed in committee of the whole and in prior meetings, establish a board of election commissioners as a way to modernize and improve the way that elections are conducted in our community to meet the needs of our times with the sheer amount of work that's happening with elections.

188
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:52,506
We've discussed this extensively

189
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:56,494
I'm happy to summarize again, but it's basically in what you just read.

190
00:16:56,814 --> 00:17:04,539
This would be the council adopting the provisions of Massachusetts general law chapter 51 section 16A to create a board of election commissioners.

191
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:08,701
The current board of registrars would become the board of election commissioners.

192
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:17,727
And then, as we just discussed tonight, the mayor would come to us to make permanent appointments to set board of election commissioners.

193
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,820
when when it is established.

194
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:25,625
Um, so, uh, that's basically the intent of this ordinance.

195
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:31,931
The elections would be run by this board of election commissioners that would no longer be combined with the office of the city clerk.

196
00:17:38,797 --> 00:17:40,098
Any further discussion?

197
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:52,229
Madam President, as we all know, elections have changed a lot over recent years with early voting, with the adoption of technology, and so forth.

198
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:53,590
So I think this is a good measure.

199
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:55,631
It's a way that we can move into the 21st century.

200
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:59,754
I support the council's initiative, and I think that it's something that will help us all in the long run.

201
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,897
So it's something that I support a lot of, and I'll be happy to vote for it this evening.

202
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:04,638
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

203
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:06,640
Further discussion?

204
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:09,342
Motion for approval.

205
00:18:12,611 --> 00:18:16,452
on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Caravaglia to approve the paper.

206
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:19,453
Would this be a roll call vote?

207
00:18:20,673 --> 00:18:22,253
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

208
00:18:26,054 --> 00:18:26,755
Vice President Behrs.

209
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:27,215
Yes.

210
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:28,795
Councilor Caravaglia.

211
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:29,255
Yes.

212
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:30,276
Councilor Collins.

213
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:30,696
Yes.

214
00:18:31,576 --> 00:18:32,076
Councilor Knight.

215
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:32,456
Yes.

216
00:18:32,976 --> 00:18:33,696
Councilor Scarpelli.

217
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:34,016
Yes.

218
00:18:34,297 --> 00:18:34,877
Councilor Seng.

219
00:18:34,957 --> 00:18:35,157
Yes.

220
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:36,457
President Morrell.

221
00:18:36,697 --> 00:18:36,897
Yes.

222
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,758
Seven in favor, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

223
00:18:42,883 --> 00:18:44,024
Next paper is for me.

224
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:47,347
I'm happy to read from the chair unless any councilors object.

225
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,711
Sorry, the next paper is my paper.

226
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,894
I'm happy to read from the chair unless any councilors object to my doing so.

227
00:18:54,914 --> 00:19:06,685
22-295 offered by President Morrell, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council invite the Chief Assessor for an overview of the residential exemption process available to municipalities through Massachusetts General Law

228
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,196
Chapter 59, Section 5C, to inform any future consideration.

229
00:19:12,096 --> 00:19:17,520
I introduced this paper because, as happens at the end of the year, we're asked to set a tax rate, and this always comes up.

230
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:29,167
We discussed in this last session just the opportunity to have Chief Assessor Bordeaux come before us to explain the process, just so we understand the process, because when this comes to us at the end of the year,

231
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,208
there's really no time to make a decision.

232
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:33,428
We have to go with the current status quo.

233
00:19:33,468 --> 00:19:36,549
So this would just at least allow us to open the conversation.

234
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:42,311
People could ask questions, residents could ask questions and see where we might wanna go the next time this comes up.

235
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:46,572
Any discussion from councilors?

236
00:19:46,612 --> 00:19:50,393
I know Mr. Castagnetti would love to speak.

237
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:51,614
Councilor Collins.

238
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,835
Just briefly, thank you for putting this before us.

239
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:55,435
I think, you know,

240
00:19:56,427 --> 00:20:01,329
So far in my short tenure, it seems like sometimes financial questions have to be considered with haste.

241
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,749
I think to the extent that we can not do that, it's a good thing.

242
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,751
So I love the idea of getting ahead of this and having an overview before we have to make such a decision.

243
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:14,093
And I'll look forward to hearing from Chief Assessor Rideau about this in the future.

244
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:15,834
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

245
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:21,015
And also just to my point, the hope would be to have this as a committee of the whole, if anyone wants to make that motion.

246
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:21,956
So moved.

247
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:22,416
Second.

248
00:20:24,632 --> 00:20:26,894
Mr Castagnetti, if you'd like to speak.

249
00:20:27,354 --> 00:20:28,375
Name and address for the record, please.

250
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:31,097
Andrew Castagnetti, East Medford.

251
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:33,279
Good evening, Honorable City Councilors.

252
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,343
I want to thank you, Councilor, President Morrell.

253
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:49,652
I actually want to commend you for putting this on tonight's discussion with the Mass General Law 59-5C with the real estate tax assessor.

254
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:50,793
Is she here?

255
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:53,936
No, the hope was to- I couldn't understand you earlier.

256
00:20:54,136 --> 00:21:01,301
The hope was to send this to a committee of the whole so that we can have enough, we can continue the discussion in a larger format.

257
00:21:03,343 --> 00:21:05,304
And after the committee of the whole, where is it gonna go?

258
00:21:05,324 --> 00:21:19,675
It would be up for the standard vote when the tax rate comes before us, but this would just be able to open the conversation so we can address questions and counselors could see how maybe they'd like to move forward the next time this question comes before us in December usually.

259
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:25,949
Okay, in that case, I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to make the committee of the whole if it exists in the future.

260
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:30,312
So basically, I wrote this up real quick for tonight.

261
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:33,594
I'm a little nervous, so please bear with me.

262
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:39,498
This law, the Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C, was started in 1998, for your information, 24 years ago.

263
00:21:47,069 --> 00:21:57,754
Imagine even our state politicians had the compassion to pass this law to help lower the real estate tax for owner-occupied homeowners.

264
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:08,219
But only, it's only if you, the mayor, and the council adopt this law at the full 35% exemption.

265
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,782
Do you councils have, have you all, any of you, have you read the law in full?

266
00:22:19,783 --> 00:22:24,165
Okay, hearing none and seeing you not, thank you, Council President.

267
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:36,329
These cities have adopted this law and are saving their own occupied homeowners tons of real estate tax monies.

268
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:42,711
That's Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Cambridge, Somerville, and all of Boston.

269
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:45,312
Even Senator Kerry gets it.

270
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:51,856
28 Lewisburg Square, if that in fact is correct address according to the IRS.

271
00:22:53,736 --> 00:23:04,320
And I believe these cities are still in none have dropped out, which tells me the majority must be quite happy with this program.

272
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:20,381
Therefore, I strongly suggest that we, you, in the mirror, also adopt Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C, here in Medford, at the full 35% exemption.

273
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:31,067
I want to thank you for listening and bringing this up more than six months prior to setting the tax rate in December, as I asked you to do.

274
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:35,410
And I want to commend you again for bringing it up eight months prior

275
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:39,165
Are there any questions or comments while I'm here?

276
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:46,053
Just thank you, Mr. Cassidy, and I hope we'll see you at the meeting when we discuss this.

277
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:48,136
I hope to be able to make it.

278
00:23:48,716 --> 00:23:49,117
Thank you.

279
00:23:49,477 --> 00:23:50,398
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

280
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:52,020
Any further discussion?

281
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:56,125
Name and address for the record.

282
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:56,986
Thank you, Chairman.

283
00:23:57,773 --> 00:24:00,355
Sharon India so Mass Avenue circuit road in Medford.

284
00:24:01,676 --> 00:24:16,245
I was speaking to my friend, Mr Castaneda during the years about pertinent issues such as this, because I do have to admit, I don't keep track of every single thing that transpires in the city and we all appreciate your time.

285
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:17,306
in efforts.

286
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:22,309
During the last 10 years I would say I'm really getting pushing the age now.

287
00:24:23,609 --> 00:24:30,814
We very, very hear the consideration of the taxpayer in this conversations that do come up.

288
00:24:31,494 --> 00:24:32,695
I'm sad, but true.

289
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:37,698
And I, we know progress happens we know change happens we need, we know we needed

290
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:40,550
some new buildings here we needed repairs there.

291
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:55,360
But I really think with the rise of inflation at this point, and also transience and different community needs that added income would actually be an incentive for homeowners to either beautify their homes expand their homes.

292
00:24:55,753 --> 00:25:14,380
do renovations to their homes, inviting other new people to move to the community, not just because it might be give them a tax credit perk, but they may want to become involved in other things in the community and we could see some growth at that point.

293
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,802
So it's just another consideration, especially during a hurting time of inflation.

294
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:19,782
Thank you.

295
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:21,162
Thank you.

296
00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:22,603
Any further discussion?

297
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:32,937
On the motion of Councilor Knight to send the paper to hold a future committee of the whole on the topic seconded by Vice President Behrs and Councilor Carviel.

298
00:25:33,418 --> 00:25:34,039
All those in favor?

299
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:34,519
Aye.

300
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:35,601
All those opposed?

301
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:36,802
Motion passes.

302
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:42,108
22-297 offered by Councilor Sang.

303
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:59,446
Be it resolved that the Subcommittee on Climate Sustainability and Transportation invite the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability and or representatives from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability to discuss the finalization and execution of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan and identify items for the City Council to act on.

304
00:25:59,806 --> 00:26:00,327
Councilor Sang.

305
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:11,385
Thank you, President Merle, um, as we all know we are facing a climate emergency, not only in our city but this is this is a problem that affects every single one of us.

306
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,891
You know, our city council recognizes this.

307
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:23,553
I believe that every single person here has worked diligently to make sure that we are advancing climate policy in the city.

308
00:26:23,573 --> 00:26:29,355
And I think this resolution is very much in line with the values of all of us here today.

309
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:41,959
This is really about starting the conversation and making sure that we have something tangible to act on and that residents in the city have an idea of what the city is doing

310
00:26:43,239 --> 00:26:45,180
to combat the climate emergency.

311
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,563
We, you know, I think a lot of residents don't know that we have a climate action and adaptation plan.

312
00:26:53,903 --> 00:27:01,885
And a lot of residents are waiting for us to speak more and provide a public forum so that they can learn more about what our city is doing.

313
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:04,586
And I think this resolution does just that.

314
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:07,607
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

315
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:09,508
Vice President Behrs.

316
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:11,963
I'm gonna thank Councilor Saint for bringing this forward.

317
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:19,588
I think this is a great way to turn plans and papers and documents into real action.

318
00:27:19,628 --> 00:27:21,429
And I think that's what this council's here to do.

319
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:28,514
You know, it's great to have a plan on file and it's even better to actually be digging in and figuring out exactly what we can do.

320
00:27:28,694 --> 00:27:33,437
So I support this wholeheartedly, second your motions and look forward to the discussion.

321
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:35,678
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

322
00:27:35,758 --> 00:27:36,439
Any further discussion?

323
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:46,394
on the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Vice President Behrs to send this paper to the Subcommittee on Climate Sustainability and Transportation.

324
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:47,455
All those in favor?

325
00:27:47,475 --> 00:27:48,877
All those opposed?

326
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:49,759
Motion passes.

327
00:27:52,259 --> 00:28:08,245
22-298 offered by Councilor Sang and Councilor Collins, be it resolved that the Medford City Council ask the city administration to present its current best practices, progress, and plans on developing diverse talent and increasing diversity in hiring for higher level positions at a future city council meeting.

328
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:10,006
Councilor Sang.

329
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,670
Thank you, President Morrell.

330
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:23,433
This, again, this is a resolution about starting a conversation and increasing transparency in the city when it comes to our stated goals and how we achieve them.

331
00:28:24,553 --> 00:28:32,595
I've received some emails and some calls from constituents who want to know more about what exactly our city is doing with regards to hiring.

332
00:28:33,255 --> 00:28:38,937
And, you know, this issue is one that our city, I think, is taking seriously.

333
00:28:38,977 --> 00:28:40,537
And I think residents want to

334
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:44,987
want to see that we are taking this seriously.

335
00:28:47,365 --> 00:28:52,226
This is a comp we all know that this is a complex issue it's not one that can be solved overnight.

336
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:57,848
But by focusing on what our city's currently working on.

337
00:28:58,968 --> 00:29:04,730
It gives us a way to, and by focusing on the talent pipeline.

338
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:11,372
We it gives us as a city council a chance to figure out more about our city's policies and

339
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:17,457
It gives us a chance to look at how we can tackle this issue over a longer period of time.

340
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:27,726
And it again helps us set goals and turn it helps us turn plans into action which I think is what residents are wanting from our city government.

341
00:29:33,175 --> 00:29:36,817
Thank you, Councilor Seng for your initiative and putting this on the agenda tonight.

342
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:44,922
Like Councilor Seng mentioned, this was in response to direct constituent outreach that I think both of us and possibly others received on this issue.

343
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:48,324
Again, of constituents just saying, this is an issue we care about.

344
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:51,486
We've seen demonstrated attention to this from the administration.

345
00:29:51,506 --> 00:30:01,932
We've seen commitment to this from the administration of getting to a place of better representativeness and parity in the people that make up our city administration at all levels.

346
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:06,420
and looking for an update on how exactly is that playing out?

347
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:08,161
What are we doing specifically?

348
00:30:08,601 --> 00:30:09,302
What's working?

349
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:25,508
What are other strategies that we can pursue to continue, to use your word, creating that pipeline of getting representative diverse talent into city positions from the rich variety of backgrounds that exist in Medford.

350
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:31,490
I think it's critically important and I'm really looking forward to an update on the strategies

351
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,541
city is pursuing to put that into action.

352
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:36,241
Thank you.

353
00:30:38,041 --> 00:30:38,802
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

354
00:30:38,882 --> 00:30:39,602
Any further discussion?

355
00:30:40,462 --> 00:30:44,583
Madam President, thank you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Singh for bringing this forward.

356
00:30:44,603 --> 00:30:47,204
I think that this is something we've been talking about, right?

357
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:49,784
It's, you know, put our money where our mouth is.

358
00:30:50,144 --> 00:31:00,487
And now that we have a new diversity director in place and meeting with that individual, I know that especially when we talk about education,

359
00:31:01,012 --> 00:31:13,440
and you see the diverse student body we have now and making sure that we are focusing on making sure that we have a diverse teacher population.

360
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:19,043
So such a diverse community has representation.

361
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:24,307
I think that's so important and making sure that we have qualified diverse candidates

362
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,323
involved.

363
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,945
I think it's it's something that we need to see that ball get started.

364
00:31:30,345 --> 00:31:32,026
And these are the dialogues that start that.

365
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:36,207
So I thank you for bringing this forward.

366
00:31:36,407 --> 00:31:36,747
Thank you.

367
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:37,107
Thank you.

368
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:39,608
Councilor saying Councilor Collins and Councilor Scarpelli.

369
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:44,630
Uh, I completely agree with everything you've all said, and I just want to add to the point.

370
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,371
Um, you know, it'll be great to hear from the administration.

371
00:31:48,391 --> 00:31:51,392
You know, obviously they have the authority to iron fire.

372
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:52,433
They run the departments.

373
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:53,053
They do all of that.

374
00:31:53,538 --> 00:32:08,467
But I just want to shout out that this council has also been, I think, doing our work with our proposal around paid family medical leave for city and school employees was discussing the sickly bank and $15 minimum wage which I'm hoping will get on the schedule soon as well.

375
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:19,094
And now that we have the city has hired a finance director that was the prerequisite that the administration said we'd be happy to discuss paid family medical leave once we have a finance director on board now we have that.

376
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:22,214
Obviously, that's not directly related to this.

377
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:30,720
I'd love to hear what the administration's doing, but I also just want to point out that I think this council is taking strong steps forward to try to do this work as well.

378
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,521
So thank you for putting this forward.

379
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:33,882
Of course, I will support it.

380
00:32:34,843 --> 00:32:35,643
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

381
00:32:35,683 --> 00:32:36,504
Any further discussion?

382
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:42,688
On the motion of Councilor Seng and Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

383
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:43,748
All those in favor?

384
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,169
All those opposed?

385
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,430
Motion passes.

386
00:32:52,485 --> 00:32:56,568
22-296 to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council.

387
00:32:57,908 --> 00:33:08,154
Regarding transfer of appropriation, dear President Morrell and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer in accordance with Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Section 33B.

388
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:13,357
From the police department personnel, amount of $45,000 to the parking department personnel, amount of $45,000.

389
00:33:18,273 --> 00:33:29,640
These funds would be used to hire the following additional staff for the remainder of the fiscal year to ensure equity and consistency in parking enforcement, sufficient operational support on meter repair, and timely customer service resolution.

390
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:33,022
Parking control specialist, two.

391
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:34,043
Repair, one.

392
00:33:34,203 --> 00:33:35,764
Parking clerk, part-time, one.

393
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:42,008
In accordance with the above reference statute, attached is written approval of the amount of the transfer by the police chief.

394
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:45,009
Parking director, Faye Morrison, will be available to answer your questions.

395
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,231
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Longo-Kirk.

396
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:58,818
It's going to read the communication from the chief to me we're going to learn from the chief of police jack Buckley do present morale and city councilors regarding the transfer of police department personnel line funds.

397
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:07,367
I hereby approve and recommend the amount of $45,000 be transferred from the police department personnel budget to the parking department personnel budget to support

398
00:34:07,867 --> 00:34:11,129
the staffing needs of the parking department for the remainder of the fiscal year.

399
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:21,957
This transfer will not affect wages for any staff in my department, it will however support the cooperative work that is done between the two departments, which is critical to the police department, as well as the city.

400
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:24,959
Thank you.

401
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:25,519
Thank you.

402
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,460
I have a question.

403
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:34,699
What is the difference between a parking control specialist and a parking clerk?

404
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,459
The clerk does the office work, the appeals work, and answers the phones.

405
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,360
The specialists are the people out in the street writing the ticket.

406
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,680
So we already have three parking clerks already, correct?

407
00:34:46,281 --> 00:34:46,461
No.

408
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:49,041
We have two and a half parking clerks.

409
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:50,001
Two and a half.

410
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,601
Do we need another one?

411
00:34:52,822 --> 00:34:56,582
What happens is one person, the half person comes in in the morning.

412
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:59,043
We need the other person to come in in the afternoon.

413
00:34:59,423 --> 00:35:00,283
Yes, we do.

414
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:06,054
Okay, and so how many people are actually ticketing now.

415
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:07,095
Right now.

416
00:35:07,455 --> 00:35:08,756
Yes, three, three.

417
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:14,981
I'd rather see people out in the street, ticketing versus people in the office.

418
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:18,804
I'm sorry city council, they're two different they're apples and oranges.

419
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:28,832
If we're out ticketing in the street, and people are calling the office asking about those tickets someone needs to be there to answer the phone and process the appeals and process the payments at the window.

420
00:35:28,992 --> 00:35:30,413
It's a very busy office.

421
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:46,685
I can say we started yesterday and the phones have already started ringing and a little disappointed that we haven't reached out to the business areas who haven't had parking in the past, and now that are going to have parking restrictions.

422
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:59,407
I say you know I think I spoke to you about this in person but, and the department has been up and running since the 10th of January, that the priority is to get it up and running.

423
00:36:00,287 --> 00:36:04,809
The businesses have called me and been very appreciative of the fact that there's no enforcement happening.

424
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:06,530
I'd like to make sure we have enough.

425
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,071
These numbers aren't new.

426
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:10,492
I asked for a minimum amount of staff.

427
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:17,063
Unfortunately, the money put aside wasn't enough that was done way before I started here.

428
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:20,510
So now that the reality is here, that's why you're saying the adjustment.

429
00:36:21,877 --> 00:36:24,219
Again, you know, this council hasn't seen the plan or anything.

430
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:33,346
Are we looking to do a bond issued by meters going forward or what do we have we repaired the, the kiosks that are there.

431
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:45,475
With all due respect city council you're not in a position right now to talk about future purchases right now in a position where you are in the position but your department is not in the position to do that at this time.

432
00:36:45,575 --> 00:36:45,815
Thank you.

433
00:36:54,398 --> 00:36:58,900
So again, I had concerns with the first vote, and I don't believe I supported it.

434
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,422
And I think that a lot of questions came about and still have.

435
00:37:04,442 --> 00:37:17,367
I know you're saying it's been up and running for a few months, but I'm getting copies of residents that come and get permits, and they're getting permits handwritten.

436
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:25,683
actually common practice, actually they're not getting permits, they're getting visitor passes that are that were handwritten.

437
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:30,968
The permits are not necessary to display that's why we're not expending a lot of funds on them.

438
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:32,850
So the visitors permits as well.

439
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:37,034
The visitors permits, they have to come in and prove their location.

440
00:37:37,534 --> 00:37:39,056
And then we put their address on them.

441
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,259
Yes, when they come to the office, we take a hint we take

442
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:48,662
a document with our seal, traffic parking seal, and we handwrite.

443
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,028
And that is exactly what Park Medford was doing.

444
00:37:52,557 --> 00:38:04,921
That's terrible, whether it's Park Medford or- Then this body would have to discuss raising the fees for those permits because we can only do what we can afford to do.

445
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:06,621
I'm here to get money for staff.

446
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,782
So again, this is my problem.

447
00:38:09,462 --> 00:38:19,285
Without seeing a plan, without understanding or vetting that plan and not understanding it and getting it started and now asking for more money,

448
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:21,977
I can't support that.

449
00:38:22,997 --> 00:38:24,819
I still don't understand.

450
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:28,241
There hasn't been a community discussion.

451
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:32,925
The community hasn't understood what's going on with our traffic and parking.

452
00:38:33,786 --> 00:38:45,755
Maybe the people that are invested, they're involved, but this is everyone in our community, and we have questions, and the questions haven't been answered.

453
00:38:45,795 --> 00:38:48,938
I know that Councilor Caviello is getting the same phone calls I got.

454
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:53,219
Um, we're not being in a point to answer.

455
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:54,340
Look, ask those questions.

456
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:59,723
I don't know how we can approve, um, money's going forward if we can't ask questions.

457
00:38:59,763 --> 00:39:03,165
So, um, I'm gonna decide here to answer your questions.

458
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:04,325
If you have one, ask it.

459
00:39:11,109 --> 00:39:11,990
Thank you, ma'am.

460
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,590
Thank you.

461
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,370
That's right.

462
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:26,693
Okay, it'll bring us up to five.

463
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:27,594
Thank you.

464
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:28,474
Thank you.

465
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:31,876
Councilor Collins.

466
00:39:33,477 --> 00:39:34,318
Thank you President Morrell.

467
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:37,460
And thank you Director Morrison for being here.

468
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,161
Thank you for having me.

469
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:46,385
You know, to me just looking at this appropriation request that's coming from the mayor's office just strictly what's before us today.

470
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:48,967
We have a note of approval.

471
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:50,946
from Chief Buckley.

472
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:54,208
I think it's helpful to hear how he puts it.

473
00:39:55,249 --> 00:40:01,032
Transferring these funds will alleviate some of the work that's on his staff to do parking enforcement.

474
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:02,073
We know we need enforcement.

475
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:05,936
We know it's a lot of work to get a brand new apartment up and running.

476
00:40:05,996 --> 00:40:15,622
So, of course, there's more conversations to be had as the parking department continues to get up and running, but I would motion for approval so that your department can do the work it needs to do to move forward.

477
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:19,459
Thank you for the discussion.

478
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:23,622
Second, President for me.

479
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:27,265
And by way of history, how are you, by the way, good to see you.

480
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:29,407
It's good to see you as well.

481
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:30,627
Don't take it personal.

482
00:40:31,868 --> 00:40:32,749
I never did.

483
00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:37,393
In June of 21, we passed the budget, and that budget was $250,000 to hire a director and three control specialists.

484
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:48,491
June of 21.

485
00:40:49,272 --> 00:41:04,781
In December of 21, the mayor came before us with a paper, 21631, which was a request to enter into a contract to lease vehicles for a period that exceeds the three year maximum duration as outlined in the general laws.

486
00:41:05,782 --> 00:41:13,086
And also for us to create some employee classifications in our compensation adjustment factor ordinance.

487
00:41:14,587 --> 00:41:16,869
And during that presentation, it was discussed that

488
00:41:18,918 --> 00:41:28,843
the department was going to be moving in a direction where they wouldn't be working with one director in three offices anymore, that they wanted to create several positions.

489
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:33,065
One would be a specialist that would run in the $47,000 to $53,000 range.

490
00:41:33,085 --> 00:41:35,787
One would be a full person that would run in the $49,000 to $55,000 range.

491
00:41:35,847 --> 00:41:38,288
One would be a repair person in that same range and a lead repair person at $53,000 to $67,000 per year.

492
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:53,633
And at that time that would have brought the whole department up to I believe nine with the director's position correct.

493
00:41:54,173 --> 00:41:54,533
Correct.

494
00:41:55,274 --> 00:42:12,883
And now that was for specialists nice saying that with this appropriation we now have five specialists, or are we, we were always meant to have five specialists, three repair people, and we were supposed to have one clerk, but the reality after the office opened is that one clerk could not handle the window.

495
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:27,944
the unbelievable volume of phone calls we get at least if I when I come in tomorrow morning to my office, there'll be 200 phone calls sitting in my phone alone, let alone the clerks, the repair for a person and the meter for persons.

496
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:35,527
So we need, so, well, no, I don't get the big bucks to answer every phone call, but I'm supposed to be trying to help get this department up and running.

497
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:38,127
I can't do more than 50 things at a time.

498
00:42:38,668 --> 00:42:47,270
So we now have a second clerk in to just handle the financial intake and answer the phones.

499
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:53,971
And we have assistant from a part-time clerk to return some of those 200 phone calls every morning.

500
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:56,712
Now, on February 8th,

501
00:42:59,617 --> 00:43:05,943
This council took up paper 21631 that was introduced by the mayor in December.

502
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:20,416
We introduced week one of this term and the administration tabled that paper based upon a question for a sufficiency of the vote as to whether or not we wanted to create these positions.

503
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,861
My concern wasn't

504
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,681
So much about whether or not we want to create the positions, but it's whether or not we're creating these positions.

505
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:34,523
That fashions compliance that's in compliance with the general laws.

506
00:43:35,443 --> 00:43:42,425
So on February 15th, this council took a vote on paper, two, two zero seven four.

507
00:43:43,842 --> 00:43:55,627
asking the city solicitor to give us an opinion as to whether or not the city of Medford is in compliance with general laws chapter 44 section 33a when it came to the creation of these positions and the funding thereof.

508
00:43:56,988 --> 00:43:58,268
That was February 15th.

509
00:43:58,988 --> 00:44:00,649
March 15th just passed.

510
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:02,470
We're now coming up into April.

511
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:07,752
We still haven't gotten an opinion from the solicitor's office as to whether or not these positions are created appropriately.

512
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:13,551
We've already made an appropriation initially of $250,000 to fund this department.

513
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:22,956
And we've already allowed the administration to enter into a long-term lease that exceeds the statutory requirements outlined by general laws.

514
00:44:23,696 --> 00:44:27,278
I think we've been very fair with the department.

515
00:44:27,538 --> 00:44:29,299
But the question still comes on.

516
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:38,363
When we have a legal question, we're asking the mayor to give us an answer, the city solicitor to give us an answer so that we can have the guidance that we need

517
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:50,053
so that we can live up to the oath that we all took to abide by the rules of the city council, the ordinances of this community, and the statutes established through the general laws.

518
00:44:50,913 --> 00:44:52,733
And that information still isn't forthcoming.

519
00:44:52,853 --> 00:44:55,114
I find it very difficult for me to take a money vote tonight.

520
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,414
It has nothing to do with the program.

521
00:44:58,794 --> 00:45:02,435
It has nothing to do with what you're trying to accomplish or what direction we're trying to go in here.

522
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:07,556
It has more to do with me being concerned

523
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:17,276
that we're not spending appropriately, and that we're not complying with time-tested standards that past administrations have always complied with.

524
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:19,758
And that's where I stand on this issue.

525
00:45:22,399 --> 00:45:29,723
I can see this transfer coming to us again at the end of the year as an end-of-the-year transfer, and it's something that most likely I'll have no problem supporting.

526
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:34,966
But at this point in time this evening, based upon the history of these classifications,

527
00:45:35,877 --> 00:45:47,319
the lack of respect, the lack of response that the administration has given this council when it comes to seeking legal guidance, leaving us in a position to look like Mickey the Dutz.

528
00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:49,920
We couldn't do our jobs if we wanted to.

529
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,440
Well, because we don't have the tools to do it.

530
00:45:55,541 --> 00:45:56,701
We don't have the tools to do it.

531
00:45:57,381 --> 00:46:03,722
And it seems to me the only way that the city administration seems to listen sometimes is when we talk about money.

532
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:07,360
We talk about money, that's when they start to listen.

533
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:12,782
Now, I'm supportive of a parking program.

534
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:19,405
I think that we need to sit down and take a look at this because we can't be doing it drip by drip.

535
00:46:20,345 --> 00:46:24,027
250,000 here, 45,000 here, a long-term lease here.

536
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:31,130
I don't think that that's the way we should be doing it because we don't have any idea what our spending plan's really gonna look like.

537
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:41,239
This council has voted in the past to have quarterly presentations by our CFO to tell us where we are in terms of revenues.

538
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:48,421
We've asked for copies of the Warren articles on a monthly basis so that we can see where our money is being spent.

539
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:50,101
We have to beg for it.

540
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:51,481
We do not get it.

541
00:46:51,801 --> 00:46:52,842
We have to beg for it.

542
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:54,382
Beg for it.

543
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:55,882
I want to know where the money is being spent.

544
00:46:56,183 --> 00:47:02,224
When I say, yeah, I vote for this appropriation, I want to see that Warren article that shows that money going out.

545
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:04,760
And we can't, we don't see it.

546
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:05,560
We don't get it.

547
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,021
We do not get it.

548
00:47:09,421 --> 00:47:12,082
So that reason, and that reason alone, I'm not going to be supporting this paper tonight.

549
00:47:12,442 --> 00:47:24,005
I can't confidently take this vote because I still haven't gotten a response from the city solicitor as to whether or not these positions are being created appropriately and whether or not we're in compliance with what we're supposed to be doing.

550
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:50,192
Sir, I don't make those decisions, you'd have to ask the treasurer, she decides how we process.

551
00:47:50,232 --> 00:47:55,474
You're allowed to pay with a credit card online, but when people come to the window, they'd like to pay with a credit card.

552
00:47:55,694 --> 00:48:01,636
Again, sir, that's not a decision that the parking director makes, so I can't answer that question, you need to have the treasurer before you.

553
00:48:02,392 --> 00:48:05,259
Well, again, I think maybe that's something you should suggest to the treasurer.

554
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:08,120
point of information.

555
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,142
Point of information.

556
00:48:11,503 --> 00:48:18,468
The animosity is you have the director of the parking traffic and parking the other representative here to answer our questions.

557
00:48:18,968 --> 00:48:24,813
Okay, so the question isn't being nasty to say that this isn't this should ask the treasure.

558
00:48:25,373 --> 00:48:36,182
This is this is your city council asking the director to get word back from the treasurer what the common practices is so we can make a better decision for traffic and parking.

559
00:48:36,762 --> 00:48:43,104
I didn't hear him ask that question and I wasn't trying to be disrespectful, but again, I just can't answer for the treasurer sir.

560
00:48:44,404 --> 00:48:47,845
Do you have anything more.

561
00:48:47,945 --> 00:48:50,846
Oh, wait for her answer.

562
00:48:50,886 --> 00:49:03,129
Thank you, Councilor Carvio, I, I just like to try to take a little bit of the, where we are down a little bit of a notch, recognizing Councilor Scarapelli's comments recognizing that.

563
00:49:03,976 --> 00:49:08,097
You know, we're, we're working in an environment where we have a number of challenges.

564
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:14,459
Without going into the detail of the challenges that fame Morrison has overcome for the parking department.

565
00:49:15,059 --> 00:49:23,822
The city has not had a to directly answer your question car via President, Councilor Carvio, the city has not taken credit card payments to date.

566
00:49:24,322 --> 00:49:27,723
So it is something that would have to be evaluated in person.

567
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:36,562
It is something that would have to be evaluated on a larger scale with the treasurer collector's office, and I'm not saying for the whole city for at least the parking department.

568
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:38,865
I understand you know because those are bigger ticket.

569
00:49:39,245 --> 00:49:44,150
Those are bigger ticket items but most people that come they know they want to pay the ticket with the credit card.

570
00:49:45,472 --> 00:49:50,897
I've heard people, you know, I got to go from one window to the other window and come back with my receipt, and they're not happy with that either.

571
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:57,283
Again, I'm not going to be competitive, but I want to know, you know, we're the ones that get the calls now.

572
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:58,604
I'm the ones getting the calls.

573
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:01,107
And I want to know what our plan is.

574
00:50:01,127 --> 00:50:04,610
I mean, you know, we've appropriated

575
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:09,853
a large sum of money and with no plan of what we're going with it.

576
00:50:09,893 --> 00:50:12,435
I just want to know, you know, tell us what we're having.

577
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:15,277
Tell us where we're going for the next three months.

578
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:21,061
I don't want to be coming down in another three months asking for more money.

579
00:50:22,682 --> 00:50:24,484
President Morel, thank you.

580
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:28,827
And Fay, I'm sure will jump in and correct me if I've gotten any of this wrong, but

581
00:50:29,288 --> 00:50:34,391
Just one last point on the credit card matter, and then I'm going to go... That credit card matter is just a minor thing.

582
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:35,592
Okay.

583
00:50:35,812 --> 00:50:37,914
I just want to mention that it's a little bit more complex.

584
00:50:37,974 --> 00:50:45,379
It's not something that... The treasurer-collector is the holder of all funds, so it would need to go through the treasurer-collector's office.

585
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:53,504
There are also cybersecurity issues that we need to look into and mechanics that aren't necessarily an easy... Other cities do it.

586
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,085
I'm not saying it's not possible.

587
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:58,367
I'm just saying it's going to take a number of steps, but I don't want to belabor the point.

588
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:03,870
comments, but again I want to see a plan I want to I want to know where we're going with this, this pocket.

589
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,572
So on that subject, at this point, why that they should be answering these questions, not you.

590
00:51:11,353 --> 00:51:14,834
I'm sorry, what I'm sorry, what is the question.

591
00:51:15,314 --> 00:51:25,718
I think the group would like to see some kind of plan and where, where this parking don't well listen we all voted in favor to have the parking department set up, we just want to know where we're going with it.

592
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:28,739
Well, right now, nothing has changed.

593
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,861
It's the same service that was provided by Park Medford we're providing right now.

594
00:51:33,662 --> 00:51:42,127
Until we can, like you said, see how things are working, you need to understand that when I started, I had nothing.

595
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:49,152
It took me months to get information, which I am still gathering because nothing was ever memorialized.

596
00:51:49,512 --> 00:51:55,876
So I'm really trying to create documentation to support what we're trying to do presently

597
00:51:56,977 --> 00:52:06,219
I will be glad to, when I have the time to give you a future plan, going down the road, but right now it's about maintaining what you have in the street.

598
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:10,320
There was a lot, no repair work had been done for seven years, it appears.

599
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,901
So I'm really trying to catch up and get things to function.

600
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:15,781
I understand that.

601
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:18,062
But I just want to know where we're going forward.

602
00:52:18,822 --> 00:52:21,343
Is the plan to get rid of those kiosks?

603
00:52:21,463 --> 00:52:22,543
I mean, can you upgrade them?

604
00:52:23,163 --> 00:52:31,306
No, you can't upgrade them they're too old, you'd have to replace them, and that can cost you just to replace Medford Square is $200,000.

605
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:32,127
So that's not something that

606
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,241
I know that I can do at this time.

607
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:41,383
So I have to solve the problems and deal with what I have.

608
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:47,605
So right now, what we have done in the last couple of weeks is do as much of the repair work as we could do.

609
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:51,487
And then your modems were working at 2G instead of 4G.

610
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:53,168
We've had to upgrade those.

611
00:52:53,228 --> 00:52:57,650
So there's a lot of just infrastructure work that needs to be evaluated and done.

612
00:52:58,966 --> 00:53:05,954
Again, if you could provide this group with a plan of where we're going down for the next six months or the next year, that'd be great.

613
00:53:06,034 --> 00:53:11,420
Are we going to be coming forward for a bond issue to buy meters for the city?

614
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,903
There has to be a little forward thinking here.

615
00:53:15,372 --> 00:53:16,112
Not at this time.

616
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:20,675
Right now, I'm just trying to get you where you should be in 2022.

617
00:53:20,875 --> 00:53:22,776
When I took over the system, you were at 2014.

618
00:53:25,217 --> 00:53:32,361
So now I'm just trying to get you up to 2022, so that it's operational, so that people aren't calling my office saying, button stick.

619
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:33,922
This doesn't work.

620
00:53:34,162 --> 00:53:34,883
That doesn't work.

621
00:53:35,223 --> 00:53:38,705
It's really just basic trying to get you where you should be at this point.

622
00:53:39,545 --> 00:53:56,950
I just haven't only been here since October I'm doing the best that I can with the resources that no one's saying no one's questioning your ability on this question, but we're just looking for some type of plan with where the parking program is going forward, because it's going to be budget time and the next.

623
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:03,952
The next three months, the next two months, the budget is going to be coming out, and I want to know what we're going to be faced with.

624
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:11,835
I mean, that's, that's our job is this is to watch the people running and I said, you know, we're the ones that get the phone calls.

625
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,977
People screaming at me.

626
00:54:14,457 --> 00:54:15,738
I know you get them.

627
00:54:16,218 --> 00:54:23,264
I'll discuss other stuff with you tomorrow and stuff that I got today, people yelling at me.

628
00:54:26,035 --> 00:54:27,036
We'll discuss that privately.

629
00:54:27,196 --> 00:54:41,384
Well that's the reason why that you need more clerks, when you know in my previous position I had one and a half clerks, a city twice the size, because of the customer service that's required that's why we've asked for more clerks.

630
00:54:42,364 --> 00:54:48,067
We can't we if we need if we want people want us to answer the phones and answer their questions, we need to have bodies there to do that.

631
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:49,588
Thank you.

632
00:54:53,801 --> 00:55:02,344
I appreciate the comments you just made because this is what we're trying to get at, but instead you could feel tension as if we were against you or you were against us.

633
00:55:03,405 --> 00:55:08,927
You made some very clear concerned issues that we don't know about.

634
00:55:09,527 --> 00:55:16,730
So when we ask for a plan, the plan is so we can help disseminate the word to the people that call us.

635
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:21,132
So when I get an email that shows me a handwritten

636
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:33,154
is this is where our money is going with that traffic and parking, I wouldn't know, because we don't know the plan of what's going forward in our own city departments that you're here asking for money.

637
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:40,996
So these are the concerns we have nothing negative I know, I know how hard you work, and I know how difficult it is.

638
00:55:41,737 --> 00:55:45,098
Believe me, I work in a city that has

639
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:50,183
30 PCOs and have eight clerks at the window.

640
00:55:50,784 --> 00:55:54,506
So I understand exactly how monumental this is.

641
00:55:55,067 --> 00:56:04,394
But unless we all understand where we're going and what plan we have or where we are today, these are the concerns we have from the people that call us.

642
00:56:05,495 --> 00:56:07,816
And listen, we know you're getting phone calls.

643
00:56:08,317 --> 00:56:11,459
It's inevitable because people say, I just try to call Faye.

644
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,061
Well, really?

645
00:56:15,268 --> 00:56:28,056
So, and I understand that there's only one person but at the same time, there has to be a plan that we could follow that we're all in the same dialogue, and separate from that, do we have just to achieve a step.

646
00:56:28,957 --> 00:56:33,860
So we don't collect credit cards from any other department recreation permitting, we don't.

647
00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:35,455
We don't have that in place.

648
00:56:35,715 --> 00:56:36,415
I don't believe so.

649
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:39,976
I mean, really, I will look I will look at it to double check for information.

650
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:41,516
Yeah.

651
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:44,357
I pay for my child care at the public schools for credit card.

652
00:56:44,697 --> 00:56:45,737
I pay for all the recreation.

653
00:56:45,957 --> 00:56:48,497
Yeah, no, that's online.

654
00:56:48,537 --> 00:56:51,558
You can go online and pay a ticket with a credit card online, right?

655
00:56:51,598 --> 00:56:56,579
Okay, you can go online and pay for your permits online, but there's no system for me.

656
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:57,099
Right?

657
00:56:57,459 --> 00:56:59,059
I mean, that's the city.

658
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,600
So yeah, do it online.

659
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,300
Yeah, but you can't come to window.

660
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,020
Okay, that's

661
00:57:03,468 --> 00:57:05,908
There's just nothing here for me to be able to accept that.

662
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:16,250
And if folks come to our window with a check, they don't have to go across the hall to pay at the treasurer's office, but we can't keep cash in our room for the obvious reasons.

663
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:18,711
So they have to cross the hall and pay cash.

664
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:22,351
President Morales, if I may also.

665
00:57:23,311 --> 00:57:32,533
I mean, just without rehashing some of the things that have been discussed, but just to say that we were here a few months ago, Faye Morrison and I,

666
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:37,589
discussing the parking department, the requests, as was mentioned this evening.

667
00:57:38,009 --> 00:57:42,411
We're happy to come back in a few months and talk further about plans and projections.

668
00:57:43,012 --> 00:57:55,017
Again, not to restate statements that have already been made, but it's really early on in the process where we're trying to develop and establish a procedure to ensure that we are, I mean, Faye,

669
00:57:55,439 --> 00:58:01,484
said it humbly to suggest that we're actually doing what Park Medford was doing, but I think we've gone above and beyond that.

670
00:58:02,684 --> 00:58:17,495
I believe we've produced a process where we have an equitable and planned effort to ensure consistency across the community, ensure that when we say we've done something, we've done it and there's no question about it.

671
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,858
We have an accuracy standard that the department is working

672
00:58:21,272 --> 00:58:22,152
on a daily basis.

673
00:58:22,212 --> 00:58:23,873
Again, happy to come back in a few months.

674
00:58:24,193 --> 00:58:26,073
It's just really early on in the process.

675
00:58:26,473 --> 00:58:34,315
And Faye's been doing a lot of digging through information, still collecting information from departments where everything was decentralized previously.

676
00:58:34,615 --> 00:58:46,178
She's trying to bring that centralization into one place and be able to answer people's questions so that we can take on the next steps with regard to infrastructure or with regard to any, you know, whether it's

677
00:58:47,165 --> 00:59:04,381
digitizing our visitors passes, these are going to take a little bit of time for us to get to happy to come back in a few months, if, if the council will give us a little bit of time, and the staff, and I'm also happy to put a written report together about what has happened so far, so that you understand the monumental amount of work.

678
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:08,073
You know, developing an apartment of this type takes a year.

679
00:59:08,634 --> 00:59:16,141
So the fact that the city, with the support of the mayor and I have to say, with the support of the chief because this isn't the first time he's been helpful to this department.

680
00:59:17,623 --> 00:59:24,770
We've been able to move quickly, but there's still a lot of things, the unattractive work that happens behind the scenes.

681
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:31,316
the contractual work, the command center work, the training of staff is no small feat.

682
00:59:32,037 --> 00:59:44,148
Those things all need to happen and that has been my focus to make sure that my staff has what they need to be successful because they are taking a lot of, unfortunately, there have been some incidents

683
00:59:44,735 --> 00:59:46,076
that have not been kind to them.

684
00:59:46,296 --> 00:59:54,440
And it is my concern about maintaining and retaining this staff, because no one wants to work at a job where they're being disrespected every day.

685
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,682
And to some extent, our clerks struggled with that.

686
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:02,684
And some of our parking control specialists are still struggling with how they're being treated out in the field.

687
01:00:03,044 --> 01:00:04,245
I have to deal with that too.

688
01:00:06,426 --> 01:00:07,246
Thank you.

689
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:08,007
Vice President Behrs.

690
01:00:08,847 --> 01:00:09,648
Thank you, Madam President.

691
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:13,430
And I think it's been a helpful dialogue.

692
01:00:16,954 --> 01:00:25,743
I think you are seeing in your six months here that we live and work in a deeply underfunded city government.

693
01:00:27,945 --> 01:00:30,108
Tens of millions of dollars underfunded maybe more than that.

694
01:00:30,808 --> 01:00:38,356
And I think just, I think we've kind of moved beyond maybe some points of tension we were at earlier now that we've had the discussion that we've just had, but I think something that

695
01:00:39,654 --> 01:00:41,855
And maybe we should put this in the onboarding handbook or something.

696
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:55,121
This council has traditionally, and in my opinion, to an extent, been relied on to serve as a constituent services department for the city, because we have one constituent affairs person.

697
01:00:55,801 --> 01:01:03,045
And, and then it's, you know, directors and you know you directors right it's like, I'll call Fay right that's what meant for residents are thinking in their head.

698
01:01:03,971 --> 01:01:06,153
That's the person who has the most time to answer 200 phone calls.

699
01:01:06,713 --> 01:01:19,203
And I think that's some of the reason why there's some tension here is because instead of having the fully built out city government that the residents of this community deserve, we take on the additional role of getting phone calls and getting complaints and fielding emails.

700
01:01:19,824 --> 01:01:26,929
And we're not here every day in this building, sitting in the parking department, knowing what's going on or sitting in the mayor's office, knowing what's going on.

701
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:32,074
So that creates automatically whether it's parking or any other issue in the city.

702
01:01:33,013 --> 01:01:38,297
I think a point of tension for us where it's like, how do we get the information that we need to answer the questions that we're being asked?

703
01:01:38,377 --> 01:01:45,162
Because basically the city doesn't have enough people working for it to effectively answer the questions that the people are asking.

704
01:01:45,622 --> 01:01:59,373
So maybe that point would have been a better 20 minutes ago, but I think that's some of the tension here too, is just that, you know, we're all, all of us in the different roles that we play are asked to do an incredible amount of work because

705
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:05,674
because we don't fund the city budget and don't have the resources necessary to adequately provide services to the people of our community.

706
01:02:06,614 --> 01:02:23,522
So, and I think that's going to be a point of tension every time any department comes before us for a budget right we've been asking and talking about a lawyer because we need an assistant city solicitor because we have one city solicitor right now and we can't get stuff back parking you need multiple clerks because you're getting 300 400 500 phone calls a day, and not to

707
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:37,097
expound upon this any further but it's just a situation that I think puts us all in a difficult position sometimes so I just want to thank you for this conversation and for the work that you're doing.

708
01:02:37,717 --> 01:02:42,521
And, and we're gonna, at least I'm going to keep sounding that horn, as long as I sit here.

709
01:02:43,042 --> 01:02:43,342
Thank you.

710
01:02:43,482 --> 01:02:44,183
I appreciate that.

711
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,583
Thank you.

712
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:45,484
Thanks.

713
01:02:46,885 --> 01:02:47,686
Thank you.

714
01:02:47,826 --> 01:02:50,128
Can you address Councilmates concerns.

715
01:02:51,182 --> 01:02:51,862
I'd be happy to.

716
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,503
Go ahead, President Morrell.

717
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:55,643
Thank you.

718
01:02:56,803 --> 01:03:02,745
I believe, first and foremost, we have been in consultation with legal counsel on this very subject.

719
01:03:03,305 --> 01:03:09,566
We have consulted to ensure that our interpretation of Chapter 44, Section 33B is accurate.

720
01:03:10,046 --> 01:03:15,947
We've consulted with them on Chapter 44, Section 33A as it relates to the parking department as well.

721
01:03:16,387 --> 01:03:19,128
So I'm very confidently here to say

722
01:03:19,592 --> 01:03:25,374
that we're in good order as it relates to the parking department and the requests that were made in the past and the requests that are being made this evening.

723
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:27,134
Thank you.

724
01:03:27,635 --> 01:03:28,155
Thank you.

725
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:30,476
Vice President Beresford, do that address.

726
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,056
Mine is on the same point.

727
01:03:33,076 --> 01:03:40,279
Are we going to be expecting to get a formal response to the council resolution that was sent to the mayor's office?

728
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:41,019
Absolutely.

729
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:43,680
Yeah, I mean, that just would be, you know,

730
01:03:46,928 --> 01:03:56,063
That doesn't be very helpful accounts tonight said to have a written opinion that states answers the question we asked around the calf changes that have been sitting on the agenda, so we can move on.

731
01:03:56,264 --> 01:03:56,524
Thank you.

732
01:04:00,483 --> 01:04:15,347
I think, I think, you know, actually, as some counselors have noted tension but I think actually it was very important for us to express everything that we've been hearing from our constituents and to have this conversation with the city administration.

733
01:04:16,367 --> 01:04:20,508
And so I think we should do this conversation in a positive light as well.

734
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:25,429
When I, I think I share many of my counselor fellow counselors.

735
01:04:28,675 --> 01:04:37,499
perhaps wishes for for you know, a general plan that we can kind of bring to the bring to our constituents and say this is, this is what the city's doing.

736
01:04:37,899 --> 01:04:48,664
But I think it's also important to note that this is early days for the parking department, it's this is to create a plan like that, to create a thoughtful plan like that does take time.

737
01:04:49,284 --> 01:04:57,048
And as soon as you know we as a council want this plan as soon as possible, but we also have to understand that.

738
01:04:58,208 --> 01:05:00,248
feasibility is a question here.

739
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:10,090
And so I would love to take up the chief of staff on her offer to have a plan for us in the next few months.

740
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:12,111
I think that would be very hopeful.

741
01:05:13,371 --> 01:05:18,172
When I look at a policy in front of us like this, I ask myself a few questions.

742
01:05:18,192 --> 01:05:24,673
I ask myself, what's the problem X and does policy Y address the problem X?

743
01:05:25,954 --> 01:05:29,138
Or is policy UI out of the black field?

744
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:31,862
Does it not actually address the problem?

745
01:05:34,882 --> 01:05:37,483
The point is problem x to me is very important.

746
01:05:37,743 --> 01:05:42,846
And we've talked about a lot of the concerns that we've heard from our constituents.

747
01:05:44,747 --> 01:05:49,569
And and I would love, I would love for a city to address them and I would love for us as the city council to address them as well.

748
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:54,611
But I think when it comes to the question for the policy in front of us today.

749
01:05:56,631 --> 01:06:14,613
We, we have to remember that the problem that we're facing is the income, the amount of calls that you're getting in your office, and the inability, just the impossibility of our city infrastructure to respond to to to respond to the customer service needs of our city.

750
01:06:16,215 --> 01:06:29,504
You know, there have been a lot of concerns brought up, and those are these are actually very legitimate very valid concerns, but they're not they're not directly tied to the question of in front of us right now.

751
01:06:30,124 --> 01:06:31,726
And I think we I just want us to.

752
01:06:32,486 --> 01:06:46,379
refocus and recenter and understand that, you know, this request is is a policy solution to a very specific problem that our city is facing and a very specific need that the parking department needs right now.

753
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,903
I think it's important not to be distracted from that.

754
01:06:51,484 --> 01:06:56,229
I think it's also important to note that Chief Buckley did recommend this transferral

755
01:06:58,502 --> 01:07:04,709
and has said that this would actually support his department as well, which is actually very important.

756
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:07,653
I think it is a very important point we need to make.

757
01:07:08,173 --> 01:07:16,043
Of course, you know, I've sat here, I've listened to everyone, and I think everyone actually makes very legitimate, very important points.

758
01:07:17,043 --> 01:07:22,284
I think there's a world where all these concerns and all of these arguments coexist and actually work together.

759
01:07:22,324 --> 01:07:41,229
But I think at the end of the day, we have to look at the question right in front of us, the policy right in front of us right now, and just refocus and understand, you know, this, this question of this funding is about the direct needs of a direct need in the parking department right now.

760
01:07:41,869 --> 01:07:46,370
And by addressing that need, we will make the lives of our residents better.

761
01:07:46,850 --> 01:07:47,390
I think so.

762
01:07:48,711 --> 01:07:57,513
And to your issue about reporting to you, I can't wait to do that, but I've collected like a week and a half's worth of information.

763
01:07:57,573 --> 01:08:05,334
It's really not a lot of data for me to say to you, okay, now we can do this, this, and this, even from a financial point of view.

764
01:08:05,775 --> 01:08:15,217
I mean, I would like to, in a perfect world, Counselor, hope that my department wouldn't have to come to you for a lot of money to put in meters, that it would support itself in doing that.

765
01:08:16,577 --> 01:08:28,473
You know, I don't have much information from your old group, so I've got to rely on what I'm gathering, and I don't have enough data to give you that information now, but I'm happy to come back.

766
01:08:28,633 --> 01:08:30,055
I'm very proud of my department.

767
01:08:30,195 --> 01:08:35,302
I'm happy to come back and talk about it when I have the information to do so in a professional way.

768
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:40,529
If I can.

769
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:48,452
So the $45,000 would staff these remaining positions for the rest of this fiscal year is that we're looking for.

770
01:08:48,752 --> 01:08:49,192
Yes, sir.

771
01:08:49,412 --> 01:08:54,594
Okay, and then the addition for these positions, do we have a figure for what that would look like.

772
01:08:55,134 --> 01:08:57,375
If that's in the budget for next year and additional.

773
01:08:58,855 --> 01:09:03,116
Yes, sir, I prepared that for Tyler, and sent it to him a week ago.

774
01:09:08,142 --> 01:09:08,462
Thank you.

775
01:09:08,622 --> 01:09:15,105
Um, fake, you know, I, it's, you're in a tough position and your people on the street are in tough positions.

776
01:09:15,165 --> 01:09:21,568
There's no, um, there's no easy way to be a bank and giving people tickets.

777
01:09:21,608 --> 01:09:25,429
I mean, there's no, no, but it's not just giving people tickets.

778
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:33,313
And I know, and I know people are rude to them and, and, uh, I've seen it, you know, but, um,

779
01:09:34,108 --> 01:09:34,288
if you

780
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,501
They've gotten a little combative.

781
01:09:50,541 --> 01:09:54,324
And again, it's not an easy job.

782
01:09:54,604 --> 01:09:57,026
It's not a welcoming thing.

783
01:09:57,066 --> 01:10:00,129
There's no really easy way of giving somebody a $25, $50 ticket.

784
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:01,810
And no one's happy to take it either.

785
01:10:04,932 --> 01:10:11,654
So I said, I've got more of my, I've had my, I'm on the- I got more of my share of tickets.

786
01:10:12,034 --> 01:10:16,555
New technology is concerning because people have never seen it before.

787
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:24,977
And my folks are very sensitive to the fact that when they approach their cars to scan their plates, you know, people come out of their homes, they have questions.

788
01:10:25,077 --> 01:10:28,878
And in my opinion, they're answering them and they're being very polite about it.

789
01:10:29,898 --> 01:10:32,199
And I've told people, you know, you haven't had anything.

790
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:40,313
When are we gonna start doing night tagging, like for the permit parking at night, commercial parking?

791
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:45,777
As soon as I can hire the two additional parking control specialists.

792
01:10:45,957 --> 01:10:51,740
So these two people that you're gonna hire, we'll be having like a night crew from like midnight to five?

793
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:58,484
It's a rotating shift between all five of them, but it will allow me to have enough bodies to, yes, do the night shift, correct.

794
01:10:59,445 --> 01:11:01,646
And they'll be doing the permit parking throughout?

795
01:11:02,406 --> 01:11:03,047
That's correct.

796
01:11:04,063 --> 01:11:12,559
How will you, again, I know I'm getting a little ahead of myself here, but have you come up with a policy for the private wage yet, which has been a

797
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:15,469
sticking point for many, many years.

798
01:11:15,549 --> 01:11:16,730
And no, I have not.

799
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:24,012
And again, people are people are already asking me from over by West Vector by by the ponds me by the lake.

800
01:11:24,732 --> 01:11:28,933
They're already getting ready for that, you know, July and August onslaught of cars parking.

801
01:11:28,953 --> 01:11:37,695
So the suggestion to you to and I know we've done this to the solicitor last year we were, I was out there with paying policemen.

802
01:11:38,355 --> 01:11:44,758
As you know, on a Saturday and Sunday when the people are mowed over by a rights bond or inundated with cars on the street.

803
01:11:44,778 --> 01:11:48,961
So I suggest, I know when, not this summer, but summer's coming quick.

804
01:11:50,221 --> 01:11:55,984
And I know Solicitor Scanlon has had some contact with us on that.

805
01:11:56,024 --> 01:12:01,967
And I know Arlington has a policy on private way parking, but again, come the summer,

806
01:12:03,328 --> 01:12:09,830
It's gonna be an issue on the Saturdays and Sundays, up by the lakes, up by Rice Pond, up by the fells.

807
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:16,412
I mean, we block streets, we do the best we can, but people just don't, they just park.

808
01:12:16,472 --> 01:12:24,014
I mean, the police have been there and they just laugh at the police, because the police don't have the ability to tow them out of there, but there's gonna, let's say,

809
01:12:25,617 --> 01:12:30,019
Going forward, that's something that should be on your radar before the summer comes.

810
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:42,983
Because as I say, I don't think you were here last summer when you get 200 cars parking on your street and you can't get into your driveway over by the recreational areas.

811
01:12:43,063 --> 01:12:46,384
Again, you should keep that on your radar going forward.

812
01:12:50,066 --> 01:12:50,826
Thank you, President Morrell.

813
01:12:51,414 --> 01:12:54,376
and thank my fellow councillors for all the discussion so far.

814
01:12:54,396 --> 01:12:55,616
I think this is really useful.

815
01:12:55,676 --> 01:13:13,467
And to me, it sort of reinforces how much of the need there is for a follow-up conversation so that, you know, to direct, to invite Director Morrison back at a convenient time so that we can, you know, I too have lots of questions about our upcoming parking enforcement, you know, as a South Metro resident, I have lots of questions from,

816
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:25,696
my constituents, also my roommate about parking in South Medford, just joking, but actually, but you know, I want us to give you an opportunity to come prepared for that kind of a conversation.

817
01:13:25,756 --> 01:13:32,819
We can really explore parking writ large, you know, give you time to prepare for that conversation.

818
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:37,462
We can really go deep and sort of get ahold of what's to come over the next three, six months.

819
01:13:37,482 --> 01:13:39,383
So, you know, I would,

820
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:49,673
you know, perhaps offered as an amendment or a B paper to invite Director Morrison back maybe in a few months for a discussion about how things have been going, what to expect later in the year.

821
01:13:49,693 --> 01:13:52,593
Hopefully we can go over some of our questions.

822
01:13:52,633 --> 01:13:55,954
I'm sure there'll be, you know, even more of a list by that point.

823
01:13:56,014 --> 01:14:03,116
Hopefully we'll also go over some of the wins that the department parking department has seen by that time as well.

824
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:08,998
But for the moment, you know, I just wanted to thank you for your time and going over, you know, the details of this proposal and

825
01:14:09,539 --> 01:14:19,743
know, a motion for us to take up the matter on the table, um, you know, and then reconvene to, uh, get what I'm sure will be a very comprehensive update, uh, in a few months.

826
01:14:20,783 --> 01:14:21,143
Thank you.

827
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:25,845
Just one more question.

828
01:14:26,125 --> 01:14:33,108
Um, based on the staffing levels, what would the annual personnel cost be for the department?

829
01:14:34,502 --> 01:14:38,985
It's, I can't quote that exactly off the top of my head but it'd be in the neighborhood of $680,000.

830
01:14:39,305 --> 01:14:50,973
And at this staffing level, about how long do you think it would take before the department is self sufficient or self funding.

831
01:14:51,994 --> 01:15:00,380
I can't answer that question until we have some months of collection, which you have not had because the machines have been in disrepair.

832
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:03,142
So we will start collecting next week.

833
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:05,110
Okay, thank you very much.

834
01:15:05,690 --> 01:15:06,511
Thank you, Councilor Nye.

835
01:15:07,251 --> 01:15:17,477
President Morrell, the only thing I'll add to that is we did pull numbers and data from Park Medford to figure out what the numbers look like back in 2018 and 2019 in terms of revenue.

836
01:15:18,038 --> 01:15:27,023
And we had numbers in the vicinity, if I remember correctly, of 1.5 and 1.6 million for the respective years, just as a point of data.

837
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:28,284
Thank you.

838
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:29,885
Any further discussion?

839
01:15:32,355 --> 01:15:33,195
Thank you, Director Morrison.

840
01:15:33,236 --> 01:15:34,336
Thank you to your staff.

841
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:49,165
President Murrell, if I could just say, regardless of how the vote goes, I want to publicly thank Chief Buckley because he has been, this is not the first time he's supported my department and financially today doing it again.

842
01:15:49,185 --> 01:15:53,327
I just want to publicly say to him, thank you.

843
01:15:54,768 --> 01:15:55,048
Thank you.

844
01:15:55,068 --> 01:15:58,130
We do have a bee paper from Councillor Collins.

845
01:15:59,244 --> 01:16:02,065
to invite Director Morrison for a future meeting and update.

846
01:16:02,085 --> 01:16:02,885
Does that have a second?

847
01:16:04,006 --> 01:16:05,006
Second by Councilor Seng.

848
01:16:05,666 --> 01:16:15,389
And I do want to note that we'll take the B paper first and then the main paper does require a two thirds vote to approve per Massachusetts General Law for this type of transfer.

849
01:16:22,437 --> 01:16:23,457
We know when you're ready, Mr. Clerk.

850
01:16:24,378 --> 01:16:39,202
On the B paper from Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Seng to invite Director Morrison to a future City Council meeting or a Committee of the Whole meeting for an update.

851
01:16:41,183 --> 01:16:44,604
For a future Committee of the Whole meeting, seconded by Councilor Seng.

852
01:16:45,705 --> 01:16:46,405
All those in favor?

853
01:16:47,485 --> 01:16:48,225
All those opposed?

854
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:49,866
Motion passes.

855
01:16:51,099 --> 01:16:57,660
On the main paper of a transfer of appropriation of $45,000 from police personnel to parking personnel.

856
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,641
Motion by Councilor Collins to approve second by Vice President bears.

857
01:17:04,981 --> 01:17:07,522
Again, this requires a two thirds vote for approval.

858
01:17:07,782 --> 01:17:09,802
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

859
01:17:14,903 --> 01:17:16,003
Vice President bears.

860
01:17:17,043 --> 01:17:17,904
Councilor Kerrio.

861
01:17:19,244 --> 01:17:19,824
Councilor Collins.

862
01:17:21,486 --> 01:17:21,966
Councilor night.

863
01:17:23,928 --> 01:17:24,609
Councilor Scott Kelly.

864
01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:26,911
Councilor saying yes.

865
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:28,392
President role.

866
01:17:28,813 --> 01:17:29,013
Yes.

867
01:17:29,954 --> 01:17:35,339
Five in the affirmative to the negative the motion passes, President Morell and City Council thank you for your support.

868
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:36,840
Thank you Dr. Morrison.

869
01:17:41,244 --> 01:17:43,006
On to reports of committees.

870
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:51,955
All those in favor.

871
01:17:51,975 --> 01:17:52,835
Aye.

872
01:17:52,896 --> 01:17:53,276
Opposed.

873
01:17:53,316 --> 01:17:58,700
Motion passes 22 dash 299 offered by Councilor Carvello.

874
01:18:00,121 --> 01:18:09,629
City Council have the Director of Housing and Sustainability immediately intervene into the eviction of the residents at 22 to 26 Bradley Road within a 30 day notice.

875
01:18:10,189 --> 01:18:12,731
The notice affects 30 units, Councilor Carvello.

876
01:18:13,072 --> 01:18:14,213
Thank you, Madam President.

877
01:18:14,233 --> 01:18:16,334
Remember, this is something that was brought to my attention today.

878
01:18:18,316 --> 01:18:19,477
Residents of 2226 Bradley Road.

879
01:18:21,153 --> 01:18:23,896
were served with eviction notices, given them 30 days.

880
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:26,238
I don't know if they were served properly.

881
01:18:26,258 --> 01:18:30,322
I mean, they were given emails telling them they have to be out.

882
01:18:31,303 --> 01:18:34,466
I mean, there's 30 units of apartments here.

883
01:18:35,227 --> 01:18:38,190
I don't know if there's any families living in there or what.

884
01:18:38,731 --> 01:18:42,975
I don't know if the law allows you to just go in there

885
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:44,718
and give a 30 day notice.

886
01:18:44,998 --> 01:18:49,021
I mean, I don't know if these people, I want to understand a lot of these people attended at wills.

887
01:18:49,781 --> 01:19:02,269
And again, I don't think this is a fair thing to do to these people with a short notice I, as I talked to the Lucien earlier, I guess the building was sold recently for $100.

888
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:05,992
to another group amongst themselves.

889
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:30,447
So I don't know if they're just trying to get around, scoot around the laws with this, but I would hope that our historical commission gets involved in this problem too, because the civilians over, well over the time period, and again, they're over into other people, they're stopping other people's building and things like interior renovations,

890
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:38,157
And I assume that when they evict these people, they're all going to be all these residents, these apartments are going to be renovated.

891
01:19:38,597 --> 01:19:53,162
So I would hope that the historical commission can do the same thing they're doing to the other homes that are waiting for permits for renovations inside, and I hope they're going to go inside and do the same thing with these with these people here.

892
01:19:55,983 --> 01:20:03,890
I understand counselor fabulous frustration with the circumstances in the situation, however I don't feel as though further.

893
01:20:04,845 --> 01:20:11,166
encouraging the Historical Commission to use their power to weaponize themselves against developers and our community is a good public.

894
01:20:11,246 --> 01:20:30,270
And I get that, Councilor, and again, they should take notice of this here, but I think we have Alicia Hunt on the call this evening to maybe give these people some guidance on where they can get some legal help to see where they can go and how they can even stop this.

895
01:20:34,286 --> 01:20:34,686
Thank you.

896
01:20:34,706 --> 01:20:37,147
That's really do have director on the line.

897
01:20:38,448 --> 01:20:39,148
Good afternoon.

898
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,788
Sorry.

899
01:20:39,808 --> 01:20:41,069
Good evening, counselors.

900
01:20:41,329 --> 01:20:42,249
Thank you very much.

901
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:56,675
My staff was alerted to this this midday today that at least some residents had received letters from the management agency and we started to look into it this afternoon.

902
01:20:57,508 --> 01:21:09,371
Um, what we can tell you is that for at least some tenants, if they are tenants, if they are on month to month leases, then this is technically terminating a tenancy at will.

903
01:21:10,052 --> 01:21:17,774
And if the tenant does not move out by the date specified, then the landlord would need to start an eviction process.

904
01:21:18,254 --> 01:21:21,875
Technically, this isn't an eviction, it's being having their

905
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,421
leases terminated.

906
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:30,285
We as the city can't give the tenants legal advice, but we do pay.

907
01:21:30,745 --> 01:21:40,952
We provide funding to housing families to provide free legal housing legal services to residents who are income qualified.

908
01:21:41,712 --> 01:21:45,475
And I can provide that information and it's on our website.

909
01:21:46,795 --> 01:21:48,016
But there's a phone number 781

910
01:21:51,683 --> 01:21:56,586
322-9119, extension 146.

911
01:21:58,607 --> 01:22:05,832
And there's an email address as well, probonolegalteamathousingfamilies.org.

912
01:22:06,232 --> 01:22:11,335
I'm aware that there are at least some residents who are on the Zoom about this.

913
01:22:11,395 --> 01:22:18,340
So I am posting this information in the chat on the Zoom for those people who are logged into that.

914
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,342
and we can make it available.

915
01:22:20,362 --> 01:22:22,445
I can email it out to all the counselors.

916
01:22:24,027 --> 01:22:34,340
I will tell you that we were able to do some research and find out who the actual owner is, because it's listed as only M-H-R-E-L-L-E.

917
01:22:35,505 --> 01:22:37,507
Apologies, point of information, Councilor Knight, sorry to interrupt.

918
01:22:37,587 --> 01:22:38,928
Would it be possible for Ms.

919
01:22:38,948 --> 01:22:46,914
Hunt's office to mail out these resources to the individuals that reside in that residence so that they, even in the mail, they've received notice to quit.

920
01:22:46,934 --> 01:22:50,877
We know that the whole entire unit, according to Councilor Caviello, has received a notice to quit.

921
01:22:51,278 --> 01:22:59,524
Why can't our office just mail them all this information that we're talking about right now so that they'll get a copy of the pamphlet in the mail, they'll get a copy of housing families' contact information and all that?

922
01:23:00,025 --> 01:23:03,027
Ultimately, what are the odds of in a city of 60,000,

923
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:12,035
The residents that 26 to 22, 22 to 26 Bradley wrote us in here right now, watching the council meeting, right down in the chat, what they're talking about.

924
01:23:12,475 --> 01:23:13,776
Probably very slim to none, right?

925
01:23:13,796 --> 01:23:15,917
If we really want to help them, why don't we reach out to them directly?

926
01:23:17,478 --> 01:23:18,479
Thank you, Councilman Knight.

927
01:23:18,799 --> 01:23:20,120
Director Hunt, is that something that could be done?

928
01:23:21,028 --> 01:23:27,754
Yeah, Madam President, we are happy to do a mailing to that just that building.

929
01:23:28,214 --> 01:23:34,680
I will say that there is somebody on the zoom who has identified themselves as a tenant at the building interested in speaking.

930
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:43,067
I did just want to share that we had identified so that in the city's records, the owner is listed as MHR e LLC.

931
01:23:43,988 --> 01:23:45,650
But we were able to actually

932
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,412
figure out who the person is who owns the building.

933
01:23:48,853 --> 01:23:59,504
And we reached out to him this afternoon, and he informed our staff that he would be calling back with his lawyer tomorrow to have further discussion.

934
01:23:59,564 --> 01:24:08,934
We asked him for information like whether they had noticed the entire building or just some of them, whether they had intentionally allowed the leases to lapse.

935
01:24:09,448 --> 01:24:17,632
and he declined to provide us with any answers this afternoon, but his response was that he would call back with his lawyer tomorrow.

936
01:24:17,772 --> 01:24:26,375
You may take that as you will, which is part of why also I am encouraging the tenants to reach out to housing families for assistance on this.

937
01:24:28,656 --> 01:24:29,277
Are there others?

938
01:24:30,297 --> 01:24:33,619
Yeah, I was just gonna say, are there other specifics I could try and answer on that?

939
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:36,800
Do we know if there's any families with children that live in there?

940
01:24:38,585 --> 01:24:39,067
I would say that...

941
01:24:40,077 --> 01:24:44,559
We do not have information on who lives in the property.

942
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:58,107
We are aware that one person reached out, the one person who reached out through one of our local realtors to my office directly identified themselves as being on a section eight voucher.

943
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:06,191
So we also reached out to the administrators of that voucher to find out if they might have special protections.

944
01:25:06,691 --> 01:25:09,873
And we advise that particular person to also reach out

945
01:25:10,361 --> 01:25:27,221
to the agency, their voucher is not through Medford, but through another housing authority to reach out to them directly for additional information or assistance as their situation could be different from tenants who are not on affordable housing vouchers.

946
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:30,635
If we have some people from that live in the building, that'd be great.

947
01:25:30,655 --> 01:25:33,959
If we could have them, I'd appreciate that.

948
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,964
Lisa Maloney, if you could list your name and address for the record, please.

949
01:25:39,525 --> 01:25:40,766
Hi, everyone.

950
01:25:40,946 --> 01:25:42,267
Thank you for letting me speak.

951
01:25:42,508 --> 01:25:44,550
Lisa Maloney or Elizabeth Maloney.

952
01:25:44,670 --> 01:25:49,254
I'm a resident at 26 Bradley Road, and I'm in apartment 20.

953
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:51,445
Go ahead.

954
01:25:51,685 --> 01:25:52,006
Thank you.

955
01:25:52,066 --> 01:25:54,928
Yeah, we were just notified a number of us.

956
01:25:55,368 --> 01:26:04,776
I'm guessing it's the majority of people just yesterday that we had 30 days to evacuate or be evicted or whatever it's called.

957
01:26:05,377 --> 01:26:07,699
And there is a family that lives right next to me.

958
01:26:07,759 --> 01:26:11,762
They have an eight year old son who's in the Medford school system.

959
01:26:12,269 --> 01:26:17,193
There are seniors, there are people I think someone mentioned on like section eight.

960
01:26:18,134 --> 01:26:25,481
And just in this climate as we come out of COVID to get this kind of cold email that you have 30 days.

961
01:26:27,078 --> 01:26:31,082
and then you have to leave was unbelievable.

962
01:26:31,422 --> 01:26:33,585
And we had been sick to our stomachs.

963
01:26:34,706 --> 01:26:38,810
In this housing environment, how are we supposed to find something in 30 days?

964
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:45,777
This new owner has been pretty bad.

965
01:26:45,857 --> 01:26:47,779
Like we all knew that something was coming.

966
01:26:48,793 --> 01:26:57,839
Um, last year, they removed asbestos in the building, and we never saw any trucks from, like, a company actually doing it.

967
01:26:58,259 --> 01:27:01,841
And I even wonder if they pulled permits for it, to be quite honest with you.

968
01:27:03,162 --> 01:27:05,844
So it's been a lot of trouble for residents.

969
01:27:05,924 --> 01:27:15,950
And now to get, um, this notice that we're being kind of evicted or they're terminating this tenant at will and we have to leave in 30 days is very upsetting.

970
01:27:18,807 --> 01:27:19,187
Thank you.

971
01:27:19,207 --> 01:27:19,847
Ms.

972
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:23,569
Maloney, any further discussion or questions from councilors?

973
01:27:23,749 --> 01:27:25,370
Are there any other residents would like to speak?

974
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:30,532
Or anyone, any other, anyone else would like to speak in the chambers?

975
01:27:34,433 --> 01:27:37,975
So I think we would be interested to know what our rights are.

976
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:43,260
Thank you, we do, yeah, we do have one person who'd like to speak in the chambers as well.

977
01:27:43,501 --> 01:27:44,421
Name and address for the record, please.

978
01:27:44,622 --> 01:27:47,784
Kelly Catala, 4602 Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

979
01:27:47,864 --> 01:27:50,607
I'm also the broker owner of Realty One Group Cosmopolitan.

980
01:27:51,127 --> 01:28:01,936
And this morning, an elderly resident of this city who has worked in Medford Square for many, many years that most of you all know came in my office crying because she got this email.

981
01:28:02,457 --> 01:28:08,762
So a lot of this is not coming down to whether or not the property owner has the right or whether or not this is right.

982
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:20,554
There was a time where we could call City Hall when a situation happened between a property owner and a tenant, and somebody from City Hall would call the property owner and just work it out.

983
01:28:21,354 --> 01:28:30,877
So he didn't serve notice correctly, and the lawyers can go battle that out, but telling the tenants, oh, go call a lawyer, well, telling everybody to lawyer up is not gonna solve this.

984
01:28:31,737 --> 01:28:33,778
We're not gonna be able to find anybody housing within 30 days.

985
01:28:34,545 --> 01:28:36,808
There's no housing, there's nothing for rent.

986
01:28:37,129 --> 01:28:38,430
There's nothing for sale.

987
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:47,523
We are in crisis, where I think City Hall and the council can help everybody in the city is through advocacy.

988
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:53,334
And I know Alicia said that, you know, they told them to call housing families for a lawyer.

989
01:28:53,355 --> 01:28:55,717
And you know, this or that.

990
01:28:56,457 --> 01:29:00,020
And I appreciate that she did make the phone call to the owner.

991
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:06,506
And I'm hoping that somebody here from City Hall is going to sit this person down and try and work it out.

992
01:29:06,626 --> 01:29:11,390
I'm sure that he's just trying to, you know, move forward with his property rights.

993
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:13,652
But maybe if somebody can kind of put it to him.

994
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:18,417
in a nice way of us being able to go through this to be able to get people housing.

995
01:29:18,877 --> 01:29:25,699
It could take four to six months and everyone can all sit here and say my right, my right, my right, that's not going to solve the problem.

996
01:29:25,979 --> 01:29:27,159
We need negotiators.

997
01:29:27,359 --> 01:29:32,921
And, you know, I wonder is there, are the people in community development, are they trained as mediators?

998
01:29:33,421 --> 01:29:40,683
Because if they're not, maybe that's something that this council could fund is for those people to be trained as mediators so they can help people through it.

999
01:29:41,154 --> 01:29:44,139
This is not the first housing situation that we're having.

1000
01:29:44,515 --> 01:29:47,897
We have elderly landlords that aren't getting rent from their tenants.

1001
01:29:48,017 --> 01:29:49,998
I was told that there's money for that.

1002
01:29:50,579 --> 01:29:56,042
I told them to call community development and they were told, no, no, there's no money for you only for the tenant.

1003
01:29:56,122 --> 01:29:57,483
Well, the tenant's not calling back.

1004
01:29:57,543 --> 01:29:58,803
They're trying to fix the problem.

1005
01:29:59,344 --> 01:30:05,067
If there was somebody there trained as a mediator that would step in, we wouldn't need everybody calling lawyers.

1006
01:30:05,567 --> 01:30:06,908
We'd be able to work through all this.

1007
01:30:06,948 --> 01:30:09,330
We're in a tough situation as a community.

1008
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:13,092
It's not going to get any easier anytime soon.

1009
01:30:13,672 --> 01:30:20,276
but hopefully the council and City Hall can help the residents of this city through advocacy and mediation.

1010
01:30:21,456 --> 01:30:24,818
Thank you.

1011
01:30:25,598 --> 01:30:26,379
Thank you, Madam President.

1012
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:37,505
And I'm sure that this council would at least one as one counselor would entertain proposals from the administration to fund housing stability purposes in the city as

1013
01:30:38,394 --> 01:30:54,303
We have been asking for that for many years at this point, especially since the beginning of the pandemic, but even before that, my just one request would be, I'm kind of disturbed to hear that statement about asbestos, and that leads me to think that there may be other inspectional health and safety issues I question here.

1014
01:30:54,323 --> 01:31:02,047
So I would just ask that the building commissioner and the code enforcement officers be included in this process going forward.

1015
01:31:02,307 --> 01:31:02,648
Thank you.

1016
01:31:04,028 --> 01:31:04,349
Thank you.

1017
01:31:04,829 --> 01:31:06,650
I do see Director Hunt has her hand up.

1018
01:31:07,883 --> 01:31:25,981
Madam President when we found out about the issues with the tenants today and spoke sorry I think there was some feedback when we heard when we found out about this situation today and dug into it a little bit we also looked into our online records for

1019
01:31:27,884 --> 01:31:36,575
inspectional services and we were able to see that issue with asbestos, where our inspectors did go out and look into the situation.

1020
01:31:37,015 --> 01:31:43,183
We can't see from the online system what the resolution or what they were told.

1021
01:31:43,563 --> 01:31:53,166
but we can see that that is something that Medford inspectors looked at earlier this year, as well as a couple of issues with dumping couches and stuff on the sidewalks.

1022
01:31:53,606 --> 01:31:56,947
Inspectional services reached out about those.

1023
01:31:57,848 --> 01:32:08,451
I do know our building commissioner is out of the office this week, but we can certainly ask him if they have a history of this property, but he's not available this week.

1024
01:32:09,472 --> 01:32:20,619
We also, just to respond, landlords can reach out, can apply to ABCD for funding if a tenant isn't paying their rent and isn't able to.

1025
01:32:21,159 --> 01:32:26,122
And we have very recently advised landlords who have contacted our office about that.

1026
01:32:26,683 --> 01:32:34,908
And Danielle Evans, our housing planner, is on the line and is interested in adding a few words to this.

1027
01:32:36,989 --> 01:32:38,110
Thank you, Director Hunt.

1028
01:32:39,236 --> 01:32:40,416
housing planner, Daniel Evans.

1029
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:46,659
Good evening, Daniel Evans, housing planner.

1030
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:49,860
I just wanted to add to Ms.

1031
01:32:49,900 --> 01:33:04,706
Catalo's comment that when I did speak to the owner of this property at length today, and with the goal of trying to, you know, see if they would work with the tenants to extend some time

1032
01:33:05,413 --> 01:33:07,094
No, we're not trained as mediators.

1033
01:33:07,174 --> 01:33:12,777
So I would welcome, you know, if there's any trainings available, like maybe that's a good idea, Alicia.

1034
01:33:13,657 --> 01:33:16,018
But yeah, we're not trained mediators.

1035
01:33:16,138 --> 01:33:26,323
And that's why we, you know, have CBBG money that we provide to housing families, where they have, you know, staff attorneys to, you know, provide this pro bono legal assistance.

1036
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:35,916
But yes, regarding emergency rental assistance, I do direct landlords to apply on behalf of their tenants.

1037
01:33:36,317 --> 01:33:37,797
Some of the programs you can do that.

1038
01:33:38,477 --> 01:33:43,999
And there's also mortgage assistance through some programs, but nothing that the city locally provides.

1039
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:47,860
Thank you, Danielle.

1040
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:55,002
And also, Director Hunt, just the resident's request, would it be possible to include in that mailing just tenants' rights

1041
01:34:00,938 --> 01:34:02,498
We can see what we have.

1042
01:34:02,698 --> 01:34:12,003
We have been advised by our lawyers that we as a city shouldn't be providing legal advice to tenants, which is why we asked them.

1043
01:34:12,443 --> 01:34:16,125
That's why we pay a lawyer to give them advice because the city

1044
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:19,167
can't give them advice on legal matters.

1045
01:34:20,288 --> 01:34:24,932
Even our legal staff is there to advise us, not members of the public.

1046
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:35,020
But we do have the flyer that we sent out last year, Danielle and I were just discussing, making that more widely available again.

1047
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,843
And we can send that along with some specific information on this.

1048
01:34:40,336 --> 01:34:47,639
Um, the, we'll take a look at what, um, Somerville has put out because, uh, they have vetted a number of documents.

1049
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:54,502
We are aware that in Somerville, it was a residence group that sent out a tenants rights mailer.

1050
01:34:55,082 --> 01:35:06,947
And I believe that in Medford, um, Medford housing has sent out, has done some tenants rights mailers, and it is a very different legal situation when it's the tenants advocacy group.

1051
01:35:07,367 --> 01:35:12,888
that mails out those documents as opposed to the city mailing out those documents.

1052
01:35:12,948 --> 01:35:21,250
And I just want to be careful as this council is very careful about stepping the line on legal matters, so are we.

1053
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:31,712
And so I just want to make sure that we vet everything, but I'd like to get something out to these tenants immediately, if at all possible, and not hang this up in our lawyers before we send something.

1054
01:35:32,912 --> 01:35:33,212
Ms.

1055
01:35:33,292 --> 01:35:36,453
Hunt, do you think you'll have to wait as long as we do for a legal response?

1056
01:35:38,286 --> 01:35:47,168
I don't know, I have the ability to walk downstairs to the law office and see if anybody's sitting there, but we'll see.

1057
01:35:47,188 --> 01:35:50,428
This was the paper we took up tonight, but thank you, I appreciate your work.

1058
01:35:51,068 --> 01:36:01,110
Vice President Barris, did your previous comment, do you want that in amendment to this paper?

1059
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:06,031
And you're right, I don't want to see us getting into legal arguments, but I also don't want to see people put up in street either.

1060
01:36:06,928 --> 01:36:10,930
I mean, that's so, we're here to protect these people also.

1061
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:29,596
Again, I think we're gonna be in a tough time even without housing authority because they're gonna be starting renovations there and they're gonna be doing a floor at a time and they're gonna be hard pressed to find places to put the tenants that they're displacing while they're doing the renovations there.

1062
01:36:29,616 --> 01:36:34,718
So I think if someone could reach out to maybe with the housing, maybe,

1063
01:36:35,108 --> 01:36:42,753
for the people to have vouchers, let them know what is available and the surrounding cities that accept their vouchers.

1064
01:36:43,314 --> 01:36:45,495
Again, like I said, I don't want anybody to be put on the street again.

1065
01:36:46,556 --> 01:36:54,642
We're just coming off our pandemic where people were struggling and now to throw this at them, I think is a disgrace by the owner of the property.

1066
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:55,962
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

1067
01:36:55,982 --> 01:36:56,563
Councilor Collins.

1068
01:36:57,684 --> 01:36:58,544
Thank you, President Morrell.

1069
01:36:58,684 --> 01:37:01,606
And I want to thank Councilor Kerrio for putting this on the agenda.

1070
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:08,903
I heard about it from the councilor and just really second to hear about what's befalling these tenants.

1071
01:37:10,384 --> 01:37:17,148
You know, obviously I think that, you know, broader matters of policy will be cold comfort to people dealing with something that they have to act on within 30 days, potentially.

1072
01:37:17,168 --> 01:37:20,290
That's just a really horrible personal situation that I wouldn't wish upon anybody.

1073
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:24,432
But I think, you know, as points that were made by Vice President Behrs and Ms.

1074
01:37:24,472 --> 01:37:30,656
Catalo and others, you know, I think that this underscores the work that we urgently need to do as a council to make sure that our city is better insulated

1075
01:37:31,129 --> 01:37:33,050
from phenomena like this when they happen.

1076
01:37:33,070 --> 01:37:39,411
I mean, there's a possibility that this is or will turn out to be going forth legally.

1077
01:37:39,971 --> 01:37:54,035
And I think that we have to consider that, you know, perhaps one of the best recourses that we can offer our constituents is a more robustly funded housing stability resources in-house, a mediator, better housing stability resources.

1078
01:37:54,115 --> 01:37:58,417
I would love to see a whole office of housing stability, as I've said, since I launched my campaign.

1079
01:37:58,457 --> 01:37:59,437
I think that we need that.

1080
01:37:59,937 --> 01:38:04,800
because as noted, this housing scarcity crisis is not going anywhere anytime soon.

1081
01:38:05,060 --> 01:38:08,942
We need to do what we can to increase affordable housing citywide.

1082
01:38:08,962 --> 01:38:14,846
We need to do what we can from a policy standpoint to make it less catastrophic when things like this happen in the community.

1083
01:38:14,866 --> 01:38:24,071
So again, that doesn't solve a problem happening right now, but I think that it really makes acute the work that we need to do this term.

1084
01:38:24,491 --> 01:38:24,791
Thank you.

1085
01:38:25,191 --> 01:38:25,952
Thank you, Councilor Palacios.

1086
01:38:27,643 --> 01:38:28,423
Any further discussion?

1087
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:35,047
Any other residents who would like to speak on the motion of Councilor Carviello?

1088
01:38:36,808 --> 01:38:55,879
I doubt if any of them are reading that on them, Mr. Rick, I mean, ultimately she said that legal counsel said not to do that, right?

1089
01:38:55,899 --> 01:38:56,980
So if we have a housing partner,

1090
01:38:57,874 --> 01:39:01,475
that we're working with like ABCD or housing, you know what I mean?

1091
01:39:01,595 --> 01:39:06,437
Maybe we let housing families, we let them do it and then we'll fund the mailing, something like that, you know what I mean?

1092
01:39:06,677 --> 01:39:11,819
But it's a slippery slope, we got the middle of something like this, you know what I mean, from this level.

1093
01:39:12,979 --> 01:39:23,883
So, you know, I think we should send them something, but if legal counsel's telling us not to, or they're not getting the opinion, let's have a report back to us with the next step side with the action plan that's from our office.

1094
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:25,750
Why are we dictating?

1095
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:26,891
You know, they're getting the legal advice.

1096
01:39:27,431 --> 01:39:29,572
They're the ones that have the experts, the housing planner and the office.

1097
01:39:29,612 --> 01:39:33,433
Why don't we have them report back to us in a 14 day period is what the next steps are.

1098
01:39:33,633 --> 01:39:34,793
Would you like to make that the amendment?

1099
01:39:35,413 --> 01:39:40,555
It's not my ponder that I'm just interrupting my good friend over here.

1100
01:39:40,695 --> 01:39:41,575
That's fine.

1101
01:39:41,655 --> 01:39:45,657
Just to clarify, since what Director Hunt said was that the city can send

1102
01:39:46,801 --> 01:39:53,805
the resources in terms of like the organizations people can reach out to, we just can't give very like specific legal advice.

1103
01:39:54,805 --> 01:40:02,189
So we can't do a know your rights document, but we can send a document with a phone number and email address.

1104
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:07,312
You're all, we're all open.

1105
01:40:08,493 --> 01:40:13,756
Yes, council president, sorry, we're both following this and we were looking at what our resources were.

1106
01:40:14,816 --> 01:40:15,557
We have the,

1107
01:40:18,108 --> 01:40:27,012
document that we sent out last year about housing, housing rights that says it's not exactly about housing rights.

1108
01:40:27,452 --> 01:40:30,233
It says a landlord can evict you only a judge can.

1109
01:40:30,777 --> 01:40:34,838
And it gives resources for free legal aid and rental assistance funds.

1110
01:40:35,559 --> 01:40:42,681
The worst part is that there really isn't anything out there to help people find apartments.

1111
01:40:43,641 --> 01:40:45,622
There are realtors who can help with it.

1112
01:40:46,042 --> 01:40:49,083
And then for if you're qualified for affordable housing,

1113
01:40:50,003 --> 01:40:54,526
We have mailing lists and there are lotteries and we can send out information about those lotteries.

1114
01:40:54,866 --> 01:40:57,308
We'll continue to have them over the course of the year.

1115
01:40:57,368 --> 01:41:02,611
We're aware of a couple of units here and there that are gonna be coming available, but they get lotteried.

1116
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:04,492
And that's over the course of a year.

1117
01:41:04,632 --> 01:41:10,556
There's not real vacancy anywhere that we can just help people get into.

1118
01:41:10,576 --> 01:41:14,318
So we'll try and send this out, but I think that

1119
01:41:15,418 --> 01:41:31,185
The, the fastest thing we can tell people is that this is a notice to move out that an eviction process would start after that date, because it then only a judge can actually evict you, but that there are.

1120
01:41:33,336 --> 01:41:42,744
Reasons why you might not want to go through the eviction process there are databases of who has been evicted and landlords can get access to that information.

1121
01:41:43,825 --> 01:41:45,187
So it's perhaps.

1122
01:41:46,356 --> 01:41:52,981
not great to wait for the judge to evict you even if that's otherwise you can stay.

1123
01:41:53,802 --> 01:41:56,844
But this is sort of why we want them to work with housing families.

1124
01:41:57,184 --> 01:42:02,428
Housing families does have mediators as well as lawyers to work with them.

1125
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:06,171
And like I said, we did speak to the owner today.

1126
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:12,296
He's the owner of Savage Properties and that's where he has this building listed.

1127
01:42:13,370 --> 01:42:22,697
And he also seems to be the owner of the Atlas group that sent out the eviction or the notices today.

1128
01:42:23,518 --> 01:42:31,824
So we're hoping that we'll be speaking further with him over the next couple of days to see if we can convince him to be more reasonable here.

1129
01:42:32,885 --> 01:42:37,589
He has not applied for any building permits for this property as of right now.

1130
01:42:40,631 --> 01:42:41,712
Can everyone still hear me?

1131
01:42:43,214 --> 01:42:43,674
Uh, sure.

1132
01:42:43,834 --> 01:42:44,635
Uh, Melanie, go ahead.

1133
01:42:45,375 --> 01:42:45,835
Oh, sure.

1134
01:42:45,875 --> 01:42:46,235
Hi.

1135
01:42:46,496 --> 01:42:47,896
Um, I didn't know if you could hear me still.

1136
01:42:48,336 --> 01:42:55,179
Um, I tried reaching out to the management office to Atlas yesterday and no response, no call back.

1137
01:42:55,239 --> 01:42:59,601
And I know I'm not the only one, so they don't seem to be returning our phone calls.

1138
01:43:00,302 --> 01:43:10,026
And, uh, I know other people who, um, friends of mine who, when their buildings were being converted to condos, they were given the option to buy their unit.

1139
01:43:10,742 --> 01:43:12,583
and that clearly isn't happening here.

1140
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,864
You know, we're getting the 30 day notice.

1141
01:43:17,626 --> 01:43:18,026
Thank you, Ms.

1142
01:43:18,066 --> 01:43:18,306
Maloney.

1143
01:43:18,847 --> 01:43:19,247
Thank you.

1144
01:43:21,408 --> 01:43:22,428
Any further discussion?

1145
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:33,294
On the motion of Councilor Carviello as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

1146
01:43:34,095 --> 01:43:34,815
All those in favor?

1147
01:43:35,015 --> 01:43:35,335
Aye.

1148
01:43:35,495 --> 01:43:36,236
All those opposed?

1149
01:43:37,076 --> 01:43:37,817
Motion passes.

1150
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:42,099
Reports of committees.

1151
01:43:42,119 --> 01:43:44,199
20-573, March 23rd, 2022.

1152
01:43:44,239 --> 01:43:48,421
Subcommittee on Public Works and Utilities report.

1153
01:43:48,761 --> 01:43:50,782
I believe the chair of that is Vice President Behrs.

1154
01:43:50,842 --> 01:43:53,043
If you could give us a brief summary.

1155
01:43:53,863 --> 01:43:54,724
After three years.

1156
01:43:58,203 --> 01:44:17,314
And I think six different members of the subcommittee, I wanna thank Councilor Seng, Councilor Scarpelli, as well as Councilor Caraviello and former Councilors Falco and Marks, all of whom who have served on the subcommittee with me since early 2020 to work on the sewer removal ordinance.

1157
01:44:17,354 --> 01:44:25,919
I'm happy to say that we reported out a version of the sewer removal ordinance, as well as a number of recommendations, policy recommendations to the city that

1158
01:44:26,479 --> 01:44:31,924
are outside the purview of the council for consideration by this council and the committee of the whole meeting, hopefully soon.

1159
01:44:32,184 --> 01:44:46,998
And I think the process has been exhaustive and extensive and that the product will be good for our community and good for all of the offices and officers of the city who are involved in snow removal.

1160
01:44:47,688 --> 01:44:55,315
So I look forward to that committee of the whole soon and hopefully some additional reporting out and hopefully the adoption of said ordinance.

1161
01:44:55,515 --> 01:44:55,875
Thank you.

1162
01:44:55,896 --> 01:45:07,366
I'd be remiss to say the direct correlation with the addition of Councilor Sang and myself in the passing of the movement of this.

1163
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:17,837
So I want to know all joking aside, this obviously was a very planned out and.

1164
01:45:18,617 --> 01:45:28,480
long process by former counselors and counselor bears vice president bears to put a product that we can all look at and move forward with.

1165
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:38,703
I think that having all of the department heads involved that are directly involved in the constituents that shared their input I think was also

1166
01:45:40,223 --> 01:45:42,726
amazing to watch for our first meeting.

1167
01:45:42,766 --> 01:45:52,418
So I just wanted to pat on the back to Council Biaz and Councilor Falco and Marks that were part of that committee that started this.

1168
01:45:52,458 --> 01:45:52,918
So thank you.

1169
01:45:55,412 --> 01:45:56,072
Move approval.

1170
01:45:56,533 --> 01:45:59,955
On the motion of Vice President Barris to approve the report, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1171
01:45:59,975 --> 01:46:00,576
All those in favor?

1172
01:46:00,896 --> 01:46:01,076
Aye.

1173
01:46:01,096 --> 01:46:01,976
All those opposed?

1174
01:46:02,177 --> 01:46:02,937
Motion passes.

1175
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:05,239
Public participation.

1176
01:46:05,599 --> 01:46:12,243
We have Shelby Fioravanti, 111 North Street, for variance visitor passes and paving of our street.

1177
01:46:12,444 --> 01:46:14,845
Thank you, Shelby, for bearing with us.

1178
01:46:15,085 --> 01:46:18,628
You should get a box asking you to unmute if you'd like to speak.

1179
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:25,211
Hi, good evening.

1180
01:46:25,251 --> 01:46:26,011
Can you hear me okay?

1181
01:46:26,872 --> 01:46:27,052
Yes.

1182
01:46:28,013 --> 01:46:35,239
Hi, I think my topics are more of a question and maybe just advice.

1183
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:37,701
So I live on 111 North Street, like I said.

1184
01:46:38,442 --> 01:46:44,207
The street is just filled with horrible, horrible potholes, extremely deep.

1185
01:46:45,583 --> 01:46:53,986
And, you know, like we talked about earlier in the meeting obviously just the look of Medford how that looks, and then just the damage it's doing to the cars.

1186
01:46:54,806 --> 01:47:10,312
So I was just more curious if there was a plan for any type of paving of the roads, or if there's a way to put in a request to have that at least one pothole filled because it's, it's not just a normal pothole it's like a large break in the street.

1187
01:47:12,911 --> 01:47:13,492
Thank you, Shelby.

1188
01:47:13,512 --> 01:47:15,654
I think Councilor Collins wants to speak on this.

1189
01:47:16,796 --> 01:47:25,505
Oh, I'm sorry to jump in, but I raised my hand because I was emailing with a constituent about this exact same type of frustrating issue just earlier today.

1190
01:47:25,926 --> 01:47:30,751
Shelby, I'm so sorry for your frustration, but because of a similar concern that was brought up on a different street,

1191
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:37,515
have the opportunity to check in with our engineering department about this where we're at, you know, what's the plan where's the queue.

1192
01:47:38,236 --> 01:47:51,187
And, you know, I certainly empathize with the frustration of looking out on a street that's full of potholes and saying when is this going to get attended to my curiosity was also you know when are we going to see an order of which you know streets are going to get addressed.

1193
01:47:51,976 --> 01:48:04,685
um, got a helpful, if not satisfying response from our engineering department, which is just, you know, there's, there's a plan in place and due to, you know, systemic funding issues, it's going to be meted out over, um, a fairly long timetable.

1194
01:48:04,725 --> 01:48:19,115
So I think this is perhaps something that it would be, you know, a service to many constituents on many roads throughout our city to just check in with the engineering department, maybe get a report back to give some constituents a sense of, you know, who's in the short term queue and, uh,

1195
01:48:19,882 --> 01:48:27,528
you know, who's more in the midterm in terms of getting their streets addressed as to the question of how to get a single pothole filled.

1196
01:48:28,149 --> 01:48:39,658
I'm curious whether councilors think that'd be more of a see quick fix issue that might be a shorter term solution that councilors, or sorry, that constituents can use to get a more one-off problem addressed.

1197
01:48:40,459 --> 01:48:41,259
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1198
01:48:41,299 --> 01:48:42,020
Vice President Behrs.

1199
01:48:42,407 --> 01:48:43,227
Thank you, Madam President.

1200
01:48:43,467 --> 01:48:58,490
Yeah, just to echo Councillor Collins, I think for a major break in the road that's just requires some sort of emergency patching to call DPW and mention that and ask, when are they coming out to fill this emergency hole?

1201
01:48:59,170 --> 01:49:10,112
But in terms of the actual long-term plan for resurfacing streets and sidewalks in our community, there's over a $100 million backlog in the paving of streets and sidewalks in the city.

1202
01:49:10,632 --> 01:49:11,632
And we currently don't,

1203
01:49:14,493 --> 01:49:23,377
As far as I know the mayor's office does not has not released a plan for how to fund that backlog so that's certainly something that this council has been asking for and requesting.

1204
01:49:24,137 --> 01:49:36,342
Ever since we received the report about the condition of roads and sidewalks in 2021 I believe, but it's definitely a severe issue, and it goes back to the issues of funding in our community, but in terms of the short term definitely.

1205
01:49:37,164 --> 01:49:38,145
contact DPW.

1206
01:49:38,185 --> 01:49:46,214
I'm sure many of us will also be in touch with DPW now that you've brought this before the council to see if we can get some emergency patching done on North Street.

1207
01:49:46,434 --> 01:49:48,076
Thank you for coming before us tonight.

1208
01:49:48,096 --> 01:49:49,398
Thank you.

1209
01:49:50,659 --> 01:49:55,424
And if I could, there is, you know, there is an assessment of different roads, but there is no

1210
01:49:56,627 --> 01:49:58,870
plan to fund the fixing of those different roads.

1211
01:49:58,910 --> 01:50:06,900
So we have an assessment of what shape our roads in which obviously many of us can see with our own eyes, but we do not have a plan to fund the necessary repairs.

1212
01:50:07,521 --> 01:50:12,968
I think Madam President, if I may, it's important to point out that consistently, the city administration's only

1213
01:50:15,912 --> 01:50:23,518
committed the chapter 90 funds that are given to us from the state to be used for resurfacing projects, which are about about what $900,000.

1214
01:50:23,778 --> 01:50:35,288
And if we look at when the last full road in this community was resurfaced, I think it's safe to say that it hasn't happened in more than 16 months, we had a full carpet car resurfacing of the roadway in this community.

1215
01:50:36,598 --> 01:50:37,719
So the commitment's not there.

1216
01:50:37,759 --> 01:50:39,039
The commitment has to be there as well.

1217
01:50:39,479 --> 01:50:45,081
When this council said we need to have a long-term plan, we have a capital plan, and then we did a pavement assessment.

1218
01:50:45,341 --> 01:50:49,662
Well, that just threw the capital plan right out the window because the pavement assessment comes with a bill of $100,000.

1219
01:50:49,702 --> 01:51:00,945
Then we have a needs assessment at the high school that's going to the school building assistance program up in the state that's saying that we need another significant investment in another facility as well.

1220
01:51:01,971 --> 01:51:06,310
It's all about prioritization of the funds and I've always been a strong advocate in holding our

1221
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:16,165
public utilities accountable, getting community benefits from them when we offer them the opportunity to stage their equipment on our roadways, mitigation and the like.

1222
01:51:16,205 --> 01:51:18,407
So I think it's going to take some out of the box thinking as well.

1223
01:51:18,827 --> 01:51:23,970
It's a creative thinking in order for us to address some of these issues because they're longstanding and they're not going anywhere.

1224
01:51:23,990 --> 01:51:24,870
They're only getting worse.

1225
01:51:25,251 --> 01:51:28,573
That's why I brought forward that issue that you referred to earlier in the evening.

1226
01:51:28,953 --> 01:51:29,893
So I thank you very much.

1227
01:51:30,254 --> 01:51:31,434
Thank you, Councilor Ike.

1228
01:51:31,614 --> 01:51:32,655
Shelley, does that address your question?

1229
01:51:32,675 --> 01:51:34,096
Do you have anything else you'd like to speak on?

1230
01:51:34,916 --> 01:51:35,817
No, thank you very much.

1231
01:51:36,895 --> 01:51:37,335
Thank you.

1232
01:51:38,196 --> 01:51:39,737
Any further public participation?

1233
01:51:43,259 --> 01:51:44,960
Seeing and hearing none, records.

1234
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:49,903
The records of the meeting of March 22nd, 2022 were passed to Councilor Carviello.

1235
01:51:49,923 --> 01:51:51,244
Councilor Carviello, how did you find the records?

1236
01:51:55,887 --> 01:51:59,669
