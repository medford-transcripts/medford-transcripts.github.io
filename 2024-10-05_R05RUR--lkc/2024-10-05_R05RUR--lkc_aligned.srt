00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:44,091
Seeing none, do I have any, do you want to take the role on the president first and then go to vice president or take all the nominations first?

42
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:54,738
All right, so we have one nomination for Councilor Behrs for president, the term started 2024.

43
00:02:55,999 --> 00:03:03,084
Madam Clerk, if you could call the roll, so that would be the current councilors minus the outgoing councilors and the new councilors, so.

44
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:06,019
Yes.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,201

48
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:19,511
I think we'll skip Councilor Carvalho because it's outgoing.

49
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:20,872
Correct?

50
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:23,515
We skipped the outgoing, it's non-binding, so we're skipping the outgoing.

00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:24,456
Okay.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

He said after he left.

74
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,212
Unless you have any words, we can go to nominations for Vice President.

75
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:43,855

The nomination from Councilor Sang for Councilor Collins as Vice President, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

81
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:01,378
Do we have any other nominations for Vice President?

82
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:13,489
Seeing none, we will call the roll for Councilor Collins being considered for... I'm sorry?

83
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,030
No, I'm still President.

84
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:20,796
This is just for them, I guess, for the sake of... I don't know.
