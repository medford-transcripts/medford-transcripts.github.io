1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Lizette, do you want to kick us off?

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:07,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

3
00:00:07,753 --> 00:00:12,614
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure, though, that I'm on the right minutes one.

4
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:17,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the one that says July 19th, 2020 for the last one that you sent us, right?

5
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:19,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it gets mixed up with my emails.

6
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:21,295
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gotcha.

7
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:21,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

8
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:27,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So the agenda is for August 23rd and minutes that will be approving are from July.

9
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:28,617
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so.

10
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:36,260
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor to approve the minutes of July.

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, hi.

12
00:00:39,462 --> 00:00:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, perfect.

13
00:00:48,347 --> 00:00:50,708
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't I from you too was that yes.

14
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:52,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

15
00:00:59,534 --> 00:00:59,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

16
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:09,354
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to, as part of the administrative stuff, can we confirm that the next meeting will be Friday the 20th at 530?

17
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:09,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

18
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:14,656
[SPEAKER_00]: And do folks want to do that just virtual or in person?

19
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:34,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one I'll be able to do in person.

20
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:35,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure everybody else.

21
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:37,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only do it.

22
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:41,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's true, Charbel.

23
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:47,130
[SPEAKER_00]: You very graciously volunteered to call in on Friday so that we could all be here.

24
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:48,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

25
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:51,852
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to do a hybrid, you know.

26
00:01:57,313 --> 00:01:57,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't get it.

27
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:59,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Charbel can't come in?

28
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:01,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Not on Fridays.

29
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:16,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Samia, Stacey, do either of you want to come in in person for the September meeting or would you rather do it virtually?

30
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:21,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I can really kind of go either way.

31
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,251
[SPEAKER_05]: So whatever the majority wants to do is fine with me.

32
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, whatever you guys decide is fine with me.

33
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:40,329
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you like to do, Brenda?

34
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:48,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's easier for me to just do a virtual one, especially if I'm the only person who's here in person.

35
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:49,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

36
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:50,311
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

37
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:51,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a preference?

38
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:52,152
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because

39
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:59,799
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like in person better because we all get to see each other.

40
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:08,527
[SPEAKER_00]: But if folks have a hard time making it in person, then it might be better to just do it all online.

41
00:03:11,369 --> 00:03:14,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, I can go either way, you know, whether we do it

42
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:22,678
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, everyone in person, you know, or do every other or something to that effect.

43
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:23,719
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't, I don't know.

44
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,201
[SPEAKER_05]: It really doesn't matter to me.

45
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:28,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just easier for me today to, to be home.

46
00:03:28,824 --> 00:03:29,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

47
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:43,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I do feel that we get a lot of things faster and done in the Zoom, though, because you don't extend the conversation too much when you're in person.

48
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,183
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but like, I'm with Stacy.

49
00:03:46,283 --> 00:03:48,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever you guys decide is fine.

50
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:51,387
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fair.

51
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's say hybrid for now.

52
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:59,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I send out the agenda for the next meeting, can you guys just let me know ahead of time whether you think you'll be here in person?

53
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:04,484
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not, and then I can just factored into the agenda at that time.

54
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:06,226
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the date?

55
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:06,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it 920?

56
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:06,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

57
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:06,806
920.

58
00:04:07,106 --> 00:04:07,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

59
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:07,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

60
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:32,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Great and the only other administrative thing I wanted to mention, I don't know that this impacts you guys at all, but in the planning department, we are left in mid August and we've been interviewing for a replacement.

61
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,067
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are a little bit.

62
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:36,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Replacement for what?

63
00:04:37,508 --> 00:04:39,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for the, for the clerk in our office.

64
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:39,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

65
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:40,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

66
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:52,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so things in our office are a little bit hectic right now as everybody's trying to pick up his slack until we can get someone hired into that position.

67
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:53,653
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

68
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:01,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it for administrative.

69
00:05:02,058 --> 00:05:03,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else you wanted to talk about there?

70
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:04,039
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

71
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,641
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like... Go ahead, Lizette.

72
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,522
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was gonna say I think we're good with that.

73
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:22,103
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go.

74
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:24,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the next thing is Medford Connects events.

75
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:26,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

76
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,028
[SPEAKER_00]: How was Brazilian Independence Day?

77
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:31,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.

78
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:34,011
[SPEAKER_02]: It was noticed that you weren't there.

79
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:37,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I really wish I could make it.

80
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, where's Brenda?

81
00:05:39,895 --> 00:05:42,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the dollhouse, but I don't see her.

82
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:53,248
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ladies that were on the table, you know, like they did a great job and they introduced themselves to all the vendors, you know, and talking about it.

83
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:54,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was pretty cool.

84
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they did a good job.

85
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:59,070
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear because they haven't done one.

86
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,191
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't done an event by themselves before.

87
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,632
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to hear that.

88
00:06:02,712 --> 00:06:04,773
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very excited, actually.

89
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:10,816
[SPEAKER_03]: They were very excited and get to know what the other agents do, you know, and they exchange information.

90
00:06:11,576 --> 00:06:12,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It was interesting to see.

91
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.

92
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:17,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, how did it go?

93
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,103
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there a good turnout?

94
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the beginning.

95
00:06:21,525 --> 00:06:26,349
[SPEAKER_03]: The beginning was kind of slow and got a little scared, like, oh, nobody's going to show up.

96
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:29,111
[SPEAKER_03]: But suddenly everybody came, you know, lots of kids.

97
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:31,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was very happy about that.

98
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:42,262
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I even mentioned to Catherine about was that we had so much support from the city this time, you know, the whole department help out.

99
00:06:42,877 --> 00:06:45,758
[SPEAKER_03]: that I think we could do something bigger than we did last year.

100
00:06:45,778 --> 00:06:51,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the hope is every year get better and better all the events that we do, you know.

101
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the support, you know, it helps a lot.

102
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:58,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're very happy about that.

103
00:06:58,963 --> 00:06:59,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.

104
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:09,327
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other Medford Connects events coming up?

105
00:07:10,812 --> 00:07:16,355
[SPEAKER_02]: There is Brenda, the, it's my event, the Hispanic heritage month event, but we're still looking for.

106
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know it's.

107
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:21,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

108
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:26,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

109
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:27,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you repeat that?

110
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:29,042
[SPEAKER_03]: You're breaking up.

111
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:43,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I said that I'm waiting on Catherine and Sophie for the dates of the event because I need to check up with Francis as well as the mayor.

112
00:07:43,294 --> 00:07:47,799
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.

113
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:48,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

114
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,564
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of events in the next couple of months.

115
00:07:52,664 --> 00:07:54,466
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very busy time of year.

116
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:02,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I think is an October 1st, like, 1 of them.

117
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:02,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

118
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:09,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So, unless there are other Medford connects events coming up, I can jump into other city events.

119
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's coming out the right.

120
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:18,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

121
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:19,203
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?

122
00:08:19,904 --> 00:08:20,624
[SPEAKER_02]: When is it?

123
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:23,167
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tufts community event.

124
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:25,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell her right now.

125
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:25,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

126
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:27,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Tufts community day.

127
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:27,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

128
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:30,634
[SPEAKER_02]: We got, we got a invite, didn't we?

129
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:35,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see Tufts.

130
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:48,295
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, Brenda, it's just like the night out, you know, I think that event is very important to the city.

131
00:08:48,495 --> 00:09:01,322
[SPEAKER_03]: And I shared that with the team, we had a team meeting on Wednesday, and I was saying like, how important it is for the city, you know, to be provided events like that, that it can have things for free, especially like food.

132
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:07,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Because some people cannot afford to do some fun things with their kids, you know, like,

133
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:09,926
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expensive, you know.

134
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:16,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you kind of even hesitate to leave the house with the kids because you're definitely going to spend some money, you know.

135
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:21,131
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a way to have entertainment and food, you know, for free.

136
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:22,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty amazing.

137
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:32,716
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully, you know, we get more support, you know, and all those events can be providing more things to the residents and, you know, and everybody enjoying.

138
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:34,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.

139
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,772
[SPEAKER_00]: So the 29th of September.

140
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

141
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:42,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Got that at the 11 to three.

142
00:09:42,575 --> 00:09:42,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

143
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,116
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tough squad.

144
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:44,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

145
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:45,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

146
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:59,787
[SPEAKER_00]: So other events that I know are coming up, so we're holding an electric vehicle showcase here at City Hall on September 14th.

147
00:10:02,591 --> 00:10:06,715
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 10 to 12 and we're just going to have a bunch of.

148
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:15,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly city staff actually there with their vehicles just so people can take a look at them and.

149
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:21,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, talk to the owners about, like, the pros and cons of the different models and stuff.

150
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,553
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll also have green energy consumers alliance here.

151
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:35,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to as a, as a resource for people, as they're trying to figure out, trying to compare electric vehicles and learning about incentives and things like that.

152
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:39,505
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll also have, um, blue bikes here.

153
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:45,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're going to have some of their e-bikes for people to try out.

154
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:52,415
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some, um, of the participants are also going to bring e-bikes and e-scooters and things like that too.

155
00:10:56,927 --> 00:10:57,827
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like fun.

156
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:05,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know that I'm teaching ESL class at the library for the city?

157
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,512
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of our discussions slash homework yesterday was about electric cars.

158
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:15,053
[SPEAKER_02]: What about them?

159
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:21,135
[SPEAKER_02]: It was saying basically what they knew about it, for example.

160
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:33,920
[SPEAKER_02]: is a patrol petroleum cars better than electric cars are like, you know, they were comparing, you know, the pros and cons to it.

161
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was it was it's a very conversational class.

162
00:11:37,961 --> 00:11:46,824
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just a lot of questions about it and see like, their knowledge as well as like, them being able to, you know, have conversations in English with it.

163
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:47,644
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really good.

164
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:48,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.

165
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:49,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

166
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:50,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

167
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:55,714
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to hear what their perspectives on it were.

168
00:11:55,734 --> 00:11:59,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

169
00:12:00,515 --> 00:12:06,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I think nobody else knew like a brand of like electric cars except for my husband, because he's one of the students.

170
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:09,579
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I only know Tesla makes it.

171
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:11,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, really?

172
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:26,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, they were, they were, I wish like, I wanted to bring them I mean, obviously, like Sophie gave me those, like the day of, but I wish I had like some, you know, like facts about it.

173
00:12:26,271 --> 00:12:34,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know it because obviously, like, they were like, Oh, I thought like, they're, they're slower, like than patrol cars.

174
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:40,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Well, I think that like, now with like the new technology, they're, they're like the same or even like faster.

175
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and it's like, that's why, like, you know, that knowledge, they need to like, know it too.

176
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:51,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wish I had something like that, like a fact thing about them.

177
00:12:51,806 --> 00:12:53,547
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, it was really, really fun.

178
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:55,908
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear.

179
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:57,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

180
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:03,653
[SPEAKER_00]: They can definitely go as fast as a regular car and they actually can go zero to 60 faster than a regular car.

181
00:13:03,673 --> 00:13:04,493
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very peppy.

182
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:05,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

183
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:08,936
[SPEAKER_02]: But it takes long to charge.

184
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:11,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was one of the cons that they didn't like.

185
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:12,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

186
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:13,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Charging.

187
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:18,127
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, definitely takes longer to charge it up than it does to pump gas.

188
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:19,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

189
00:13:20,388 --> 00:13:22,950
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

190
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:23,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

191
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:29,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's also the Mystic River Celebration, September 21st at the Condon Shell.

192
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that you guys are thinking about attending?

193
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:35,459
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not even know that that was happening.

194
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:39,476
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of an art thing.

195
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:43,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me drop the link into the chat.

196
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:46,520
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the name again?

197
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,941
[SPEAKER_00]: A Mystic River Celebration.

198
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:52,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it's a Wednesday, Wednesday afternoon, 12 to 4.

199
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:59,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, it's Saturday the 21st from 12 to 4.

200
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:02,430
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be looking at last year.

201
00:14:05,315 --> 00:14:05,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

202
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:06,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

203
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:06,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

204
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:07,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I see it now.

205
00:14:08,057 --> 00:14:08,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.

206
00:14:09,138 --> 00:14:09,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

207
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:14,502
[SPEAKER_00]: The form I gave you was the registration form for vendors.

208
00:14:15,723 --> 00:14:20,767
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do the main page for it too.

209
00:14:20,787 --> 00:14:25,550
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

210
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I just dropped the main page into the chat.

211
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:37,538
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like performances, crafts, food, lots of activities for kids.

212
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:47,949
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks fun.

213
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

214
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,073
[SPEAKER_00]: So I signed up the table there for Electrify Medford.

215
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:54,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's cool.

216
00:15:00,913 --> 00:15:07,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to be at the farmers market on September 26th.

217
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:13,702
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are a couple of events coming up that I won't be able to make it to because I'm going to be out of town for a couple of weeks.

218
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:16,263
[SPEAKER_00]: So run Medford is happening on the 27th.

219
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:29,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, 27th and 28th, there's a thing at Hormel Stadium with lots of activities for kids and the mayor speaking and things like that on the 27th.

220
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:33,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the 28th at 8 AM, there's the actual race.

221
00:15:42,924 --> 00:15:45,927
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many people usually go to that, but that's an annual thing.

222
00:15:48,602 --> 00:15:51,103
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mentioned Community Day.

223
00:15:51,844 --> 00:15:56,926
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping to have someone from Electrify Medford there, but I won't be able to be there myself.

224
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:03,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And then same for Oktoberfest, which is October 5th in Medford Square.

225
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:08,210
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be available for the Community Day?

226
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:10,391
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I won't.

227
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,312
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of town for two weeks then.

228
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:18,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll check with Sophie if we're having a table over there, maybe we can share a table.

229
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:23,048
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.

230
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:24,670
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

231
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:33,458
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be back in time for the Harvest Your Energy Festival on October 19th.

232
00:16:45,227 --> 00:16:49,931
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all the events that are happening, at least the ones that I'm aware of.

233
00:16:55,035 --> 00:17:02,200
[SPEAKER_00]: Switching gears a little bit, the curbside composting program, we have over 5,000 people signed up for it now.

234
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:06,203
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to get the word out, though, because our goal for this year was 6,000.

235
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:09,386
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to hit that and surpass it.

236
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:11,868
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.

237
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:16,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry, Brenda.

238
00:17:16,898 --> 00:17:19,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been giving out those, um, the doors.

239
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

240
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those door hangers because on the back of them, it lists out all of the foods that can and can't go into the combo.

241
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:35,023
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something useful that people could like post up on their refrigerator or something.

242
00:17:35,783 --> 00:17:36,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

243
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:43,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we talk about last time that there couldn't be any bones and stuff like that.

244
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:44,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a good thing that they

245
00:17:45,862 --> 00:17:49,625
[SPEAKER_02]: put that there, like the list in the back of it?

246
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:51,866
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

247
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:56,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there can be bones, because it's a commercial composting facility that it's going to.

248
00:17:56,269 --> 00:18:00,192
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't do bones in your own backyard composter, but I think you can.

249
00:18:00,532 --> 00:18:00,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

250
00:18:05,991 --> 00:18:06,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what else.

251
00:18:07,512 --> 00:18:14,418
[SPEAKER_00]: For the McGlynn and Andrews HVAC project, we finally signed the contract with the designer.

252
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:18,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're working right now on an existing conditions assessment.

253
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:28,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're putting together the owner's project requirements so that they have all the details that they need in order to design the project.

254
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:41,035
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little behind schedule on that because it took so long with the contracting, but we're hoping to to make it up by moving quickly with the assessments and the project requirements.

255
00:18:44,076 --> 00:18:47,537
[SPEAKER_00]: But that project construction won't start until next summer.

256
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:50,919
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the design is going to extend through.

257
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:56,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Early next year, I mean, at least you guys got it.

258
00:18:58,113 --> 00:19:00,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, finally we're moving forward.

259
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:05,797
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's crazy.

260
00:19:06,498 --> 00:19:23,427
[SPEAKER_00]: A new thing, we are going to the city council on September 10th to get approval for an EV charging revolving fund and that way money that people pay to charge their cars at city-owned charging stations can be used to pay for

261
00:19:24,107 --> 00:19:26,630
[SPEAKER_00]: the electricity and the maintenance of the stations.

262
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, that's just coming out of the planning department's budget.

263
00:19:32,175 --> 00:19:40,704
[SPEAKER_00]: And use of the stations has more than doubled each year since 2021, so it's becoming a bigger and bigger chunk of our budget each year.

264
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:47,551
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time,

265
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:54,709
[SPEAKER_00]: We're planning to increase the amount that people are paying at the stations so that we can cover our costs.

266
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,951
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, people are paying 25 cents per kilowatt hour.

267
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:03,373
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're planning to increase that to 35 cents per kilowatt hour.

268
00:20:03,393 --> 00:20:09,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's roughly equivalent to like $3.50 for a gallon of gas.

269
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:17,038
[SPEAKER_00]: If people charge at home right now, by comparison, they can pay 21 cents per kilowatt hour.

270
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,295
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're with Medford's aggregation.

271
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:33,705
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things I wanted to talk with you guys about is we don't want to burden low-income residents by increasing the cost.

272
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:42,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to set it up so that they can get discounted charging by signing up through the city and getting a special card to use.

273
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:47,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's something that people would actually do?

274
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:53,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that many low-income residents currently have electric vehicles?

275
00:20:53,348 --> 00:21:01,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the big question for that because in all honesty, I think,

276
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:05,696
[SPEAKER_02]: only you're the only person that I know that has an electric car.

277
00:21:06,316 --> 00:21:14,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to be honest, I don't, I don't know anybody else that has an electric car, which I know they're like good for the environment.

278
00:21:14,061 --> 00:21:20,225
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that that for me is like the most important, the cause of having one.

279
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:21,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

280
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,007
[SPEAKER_00]: You should come to the EV showcase.

281
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,709
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of people who work here in city hall who have them.

282
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,810
[SPEAKER_00]: You can meet more people.

283
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:29,771
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you say that was again?

284
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:31,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's on the September 14th.

285
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:38,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

286
00:21:41,026 --> 00:21:50,152
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things is I don't want to discourage people from getting an electric vehicle by raising the price, right?

287
00:21:50,213 --> 00:22:02,521
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone, I know the upfront cost of an EV can be expensive, but there are, you know, there are incentives that are available to buy that down a little bit.

288
00:22:05,882 --> 00:22:10,914
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want the operating cost of it to be a factor.

289
00:22:10,934 --> 00:22:14,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's pretty much equivalent to what gas is now.

290
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:31,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but if people don't get incentive to pay for their gas, you know, and I think you were in that line that when you're trying to advocate for a cleaner environment and everything, you know, we always encounter those people that, you know, don't agree with certain, you know.

291
00:22:32,988 --> 00:22:43,810
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've been trying, you know, don't go deeper with people, you know, and I respect their opinions when they come to me and bring those issues, but I can see their point.

292
00:22:44,499 --> 00:23:02,094
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like that is really not, they can afford an electric car because they cannot afford a new car at all, you know, even with the incentive, you know, but that is all those on top of that incentive, like you're just talking about, you know, reduce the cost and everything for people that has an electric car.

293
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:09,480
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not an incentive for people that can't afford the electric car right now to, you can go from home to work.

294
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,943
[SPEAKER_03]: So in any state that made that conversation that, you know,

295
00:23:15,068 --> 00:23:28,852
[SPEAKER_03]: you try to advocate for a cleaner environment, you know, like, and we just need to listen, but they automatically think that we're the cause of all that, you know, like, and sometimes I feel attacked by some people because of that.

296
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:30,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that a lot.

297
00:23:30,433 --> 00:23:30,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

298
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:34,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

299
00:23:35,374 --> 00:23:42,877
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I mean, basically what we're trying to think about right now is by creating the option for

300
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:52,258
[SPEAKER_00]: low-income residents to sign up for this and get a discount on their charging.

301
00:23:53,539 --> 00:24:01,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Are people going to take advantage of it or are we setting up a whole process and the administrative burden of it that's not actually going to be useful?

302
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:09,923
[SPEAKER_03]: But the charger at home takes longer than the charger that we have in the street, isn't that right?

303
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Or am I mistaking that?

304
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:12,506
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.

305
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:16,629
[SPEAKER_00]: You can install a level two charger at home that goes the same speed as this one.

306
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:17,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

307
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:18,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

308
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:33,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I heard some people saying that, you know, they always put in their schedule to charge their cars, you know, in the public places and all the public chargers, because they're not so worried about the charging, you know, for their electric bills or whatever.

309
00:24:33,985 --> 00:24:34,746
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the timing.

310
00:24:35,486 --> 00:24:38,027
[SPEAKER_03]: that was taking for them to charge their car.

311
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:38,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

312
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:42,889
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming that that's because they haven't installed a level 2 charger at home.

313
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:46,011
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just doing it with a regular wall outlet.

314
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:48,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

315
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,942
[SPEAKER_00]: But my thought is, what if people don't have a driveway?

316
00:24:57,682 --> 00:25:02,245
[SPEAKER_00]: What if they live in a multifamily building or something, or they have to park on the street?

317
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:08,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to still be able to charge at a lower cost if they can.

318
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:34,758
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you, do they have to pay for, do you have to pay for the public, for those public charging areas or?

319
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:37,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, see, I didn't, I didn't know that.

320
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:42,340
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I just thought, you know, it was just a service that, okay.

321
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,901
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to like put in some kind of ID kind of thing or something like that and okay.

322
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:51,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.

323
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:55,522
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either get a card or you can connect it to your phone and pay with your phone, whichever.

324
00:25:56,857 --> 00:26:05,560
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's the difference in the charging time, the level two versus, was it just a level two and your home outlet?

325
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:09,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it 12 volts or whatever it is, your wall outlet?

326
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:14,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me pull this up right now, actually.

327
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:19,846
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this in the decarbonization roadmap that we're going to talk about in a second.

328
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:21,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

329
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:24,757
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not going to get that into that.

330
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:26,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to point out the roadmap.

331
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:28,678
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into that detail about it.

332
00:26:29,058 --> 00:26:41,443
[SPEAKER_00]: So level one, which is like plugging into a regular outlet at home is about, uh, you can get about 50 miles overnight, eight hours, six hours.

333
00:26:41,463 --> 00:26:43,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

334
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:46,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight hours, probably level two.

335
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,973
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what we have for Medford's public chargers.

336
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:55,496
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get about 300 miles overnight.

337
00:26:55,516 --> 00:27:06,745
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are similar to an outlet for an electric dryer or, I don't know, an electric stove.

338
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:11,489
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can install one of these in your home.

339
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:14,071
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

340
00:27:14,691 --> 00:27:14,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

341
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:22,169
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the three ones you can do like 170 miles in 30 minutes, but the city doesn't own any of those.

342
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:23,449
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to be more like.

343
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:25,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so there's a level three.

344
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,090
[SPEAKER_00]: So level three, is that it?

345
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,470
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the highest it goes?

346
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Level three is the highest.

347
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:31,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

348
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:38,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And those tend to be installed in places that people are only going to be for a few minutes, like at rest stops on the highway, things like that.

349
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:39,912
[SPEAKER_05]: What about a mall?

350
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:41,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

351
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:42,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

352
00:27:42,733 --> 00:27:43,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely seen them there.

353
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:48,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And the faster it charges, the more it costs?

354
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:49,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

355
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:50,276
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

356
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:51,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Makes sense.

357
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

358
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:59,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Level 3, that's a significant difference than overnight.

359
00:28:00,584 --> 00:28:00,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

360
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:06,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Level 3 chargers tend, around here, cost between $0.50 and $0.55 per kilowatt hour.

361
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:14,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

362
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:24,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So like $0.21 per kilowatt hour at home, we're going to be increasing our cost here to $0.35 per kilowatt hour for the level two.

363
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,687
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the level threes are $0.50 to $0.55 per kilowatt hour.

364
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:28,107
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.

365
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:42,022
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so it doesn't sound like there's a lot of passion about setting up this discounted charging.

366
00:28:43,142 --> 00:28:43,763
[SPEAKER_00]: Program.

367
00:28:43,783 --> 00:28:53,324
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I kind of tend to agree with us, saw me, saw me, I mean.

368
00:28:54,985 --> 00:29:00,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, unless you already have a car or, you know, you know, there's one in, you know, in your future, but.

369
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:03,166
[SPEAKER_05]: You know.

370
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:11,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree beneficial just for the ones who have the car, but.

371
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:16,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think majority of, like, you know, people have it.

372
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,865
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there are a lot more used ones available now than there used to be.

373
00:29:23,506 --> 00:29:26,930
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm just thinking over the next few years as.

374
00:29:29,516 --> 00:29:35,323
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, as you get more used ones on the market, you might tend to see people using those more.

375
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:37,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it might change then.

376
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:40,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I think we're not there yet.

377
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:41,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

378
00:29:44,044 --> 00:29:50,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I think spreading the word out, though, is more important to just like letting them know, like, hey, this is an option.

379
00:29:50,929 --> 00:30:02,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you guys if you guys have money to buy a car, they try to see if you can get a used like electric car because it's good for the environment and you don't waste as much and blah, blah.

380
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's like worth noting down.

381
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:06,480
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

382
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:24,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of discounts, did you guys hear that the MBTA now has discounted, have expanded their discount program?

383
00:30:29,272 --> 00:30:29,653
[SPEAKER_00]: How?

384
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:36,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So before it was really limited in who it was available to and so it was like,

385
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:40,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me pull this up in front of me right now.

386
00:30:40,453 --> 00:30:50,318
[SPEAKER_00]: It was available to certain students and people who are on disability and things like that.

387
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:55,040
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's more open to anybody who's below a certain income level.

388
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:06,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the link for it.

389
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:07,727
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drop it into the chat.

390
00:31:08,887 --> 00:31:12,868
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's something that would be really good to get the word out about.

391
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:27,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Applications will be available to the public on September 4th.

392
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:35,237
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 50% discount.

393
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:43,781
[SPEAKER_00]: $10 weekly passes or $30 monthly passes.

394
00:31:49,865 --> 00:31:54,889
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.

395
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:58,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I was on the train more, but unfortunately, my job is done here.

396
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:03,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I used to know more about that when I commuted anywhere.

397
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:08,080
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like to know this stuff.

398
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:16,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Even, for example, my students that I was teaching, they didn't even know that they could get a library card even though they were in the library.

399
00:32:16,987 --> 00:32:17,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that crazy?

400
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:22,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made them get their stuff ready.

401
00:32:22,712 --> 00:32:26,254
[SPEAKER_02]: So on Tuesday, they're able to get their library card.

402
00:32:26,635 --> 00:32:30,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good info to tell them, hey, you guys use MBTA.

403
00:32:30,178 --> 00:32:32,059
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys use the bus and all that stuff.

404
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:33,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at this information I have.

405
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:48,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep, and I was just thinking, like, as you guys are out in the community to talking with people about about the things that's a great thing to know, because, you know, not using using public transportation is a very environmental.

406
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:49,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing to do.

407
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:53,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, no, I agree.

408
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:00,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

409
00:33:00,624 --> 00:33:01,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's see.

410
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:04,325
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on electrify Medford.

411
00:33:04,766 --> 00:33:08,887
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had that kickoff event on July 31st, and that was really successful.

412
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:13,489
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a, I think we had more than 40 people show up for it.

413
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:23,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we had, there was, it did presentation and then, uh, the mayor spoke and then we did some great, like one-on-one conversations with people too.

414
00:33:25,352 --> 00:33:26,753
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really happy with that.

415
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:36,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we now have Spanish and Haitian Creole translations of our decarbonization roadmap.

416
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:48,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'd love to send those to you guys for, uh, to just like review them for accuracy to make sure there's nothing embarrassing in there.

417
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:51,512
[SPEAKER_00]: It was translated badly.

418
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Frances tells me that we can't use the translation service that she's been using for large documents anymore.

419
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:10,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think we do some, we do like smaller documents in-house and then the bigger ones we farm out.

420
00:34:12,606 --> 00:34:17,429
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys know how the Office of Outreach and Prevention translates large documents?

421
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:20,030
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

422
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure the only thing I know is that we.

423
00:34:23,712 --> 00:34:27,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Translate we can only do up to 500 words or something like that.

424
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, we don't know.

425
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,341
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good question to ask Sophie or Catherine.

426
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:43,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if anything, I'll email them and I'll let, you know, Brenda, what they use.

427
00:34:43,808 --> 00:34:47,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that sounds good because we still need to translate the decarbonization.

428
00:34:50,175 --> 00:34:53,376
[SPEAKER_00]: other language into Portuguese and Arabic.

429
00:34:53,436 --> 00:34:58,278
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's still in the works.

430
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:07,982
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that if you just email them to Brenda and ask and let them know that you understand the limit of words, you know, and

431
00:35:09,055 --> 00:35:11,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll say yes, you never know, you know.

432
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:12,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

433
00:35:12,316 --> 00:35:17,358
[SPEAKER_00]: These are like, this is like 18 pages because it's like all of the information.

434
00:35:17,378 --> 00:35:17,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

435
00:35:18,078 --> 00:35:18,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

436
00:35:18,958 --> 00:35:21,679
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all of the information that we have for residents.

437
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:30,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we do the coaching and we find out more about them, then we pull out exactly what applies to them and pop it into a personalized version of it for them.

438
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:32,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, nevermind.

439
00:35:32,561 --> 00:35:34,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to sign up for that.

440
00:35:34,662 --> 00:35:36,122
It's my whole month of hours.

441
00:35:36,162 --> 00:35:37,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.

442
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:37,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

443
00:35:37,583 --> 00:35:42,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we've had 51 residents sign up for Electrify Medford so far.

444
00:35:57,907 --> 00:35:58,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's awesome.

445
00:35:59,047 --> 00:35:59,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

446
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:01,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say.

447
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:07,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a quarter of them are more mostly interested in getting, um.

448
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:19,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at ways to reduce their electric, their energy rates, so talking about, like, discounted electricity and gas rates and the aggregation and things like that.

449
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:23,456
[SPEAKER_00]: And about a quarter of them seem to be interested in solar.

450
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:37,574
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other half of them seems to be more general, that they're just looking for, you know, whatever ways are out there to, you know, reduce the bills.

451
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:37,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

452
00:36:38,635 --> 00:36:42,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Thinking about the last week cars, we just dropped off my daughter at college.

453
00:36:42,957 --> 00:36:54,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the orientations that we have, they talk about cars, you know, the students can have their own car, but they need to have a specific, you know, passes to have parking and stuff like that.

454
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:59,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the students are interested to get their first car, electric car.

455
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:17,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it'll be something to think in the future, you know, like maybe your first car, you know, incentive for you to get your first car, you know, if it's electric, you know, be a little more, you know, because I know a lot, not my kids, but a lot of kids that have been saving money, you know, to buy their own car and stuff like that.

456
00:37:19,073 --> 00:37:21,694
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it would be something to think in the future, you know.

457
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:30,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that might be a good thing to focus on with like tough students, knowing that that might be something that they're particularly interested in.

458
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:41,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but it's tough to also have a lot of foreign students, you know, that don't necessarily want to spend money with the car and be here.

459
00:37:41,643 --> 00:37:42,304
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?

460
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:45,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I know they have a lot of exchange students.

461
00:37:45,546 --> 00:37:47,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, but never know.

462
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:51,289
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of colleges around here, so, you know, why not?

463
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:51,789
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

464
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:52,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

465
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:57,429
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of them take public transportation to go to UMass and stuff like that.

466
00:37:57,469 --> 00:38:06,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they can afford the first car and it's an electric car, I think that would be pretty cool.

467
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:09,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.

468
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:17,797
[SPEAKER_00]: And Lizette, I haven't forgotten that we were going to talk about giveaways for tabling.

469
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:21,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we have that pending, that meeting.

470
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:23,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.

471
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:29,551
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to make sure that whatever we do, that it's kind of on brand, right?

472
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:33,272
[SPEAKER_00]: So not like plastic that's going to be thrown away immediately.

473
00:38:33,372 --> 00:38:36,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing that's like using electricity that doesn't need to.

474
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:36,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

475
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:43,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe things like paper fans or something that have the branding on it or something.

476
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:44,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

477
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:44,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

478
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:47,300
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was thinking the same.

479
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And like,

480
00:38:50,307 --> 00:38:51,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.

481
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:58,870
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is, like, we'd have to see, like, also budget and what we can use that, like you said, can't be thrown out.

482
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:16,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I know that, like, um, I think I've mentioned before that when I went to Lebanon, I, like, got, like, these bulbs that, like, when the electricity went for the bulbs, the

483
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,422
[SPEAKER_02]: They were while the electricity was going through and then when the electricity would go off, they'd have it.

484
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:28,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just thinking of, like, maybe, um.

485
00:39:30,323 --> 00:39:36,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, either the information for people, or we can find something like, affordable to, like.

486
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:41,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for giveaway not like to give to everyone obviously.

487
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:53,433
[SPEAKER_02]: how I spoke to you about like, at the national night outs, we should do like that, like wheel of the what is it?

488
00:39:55,134 --> 00:39:56,976
[SPEAKER_02]: The turbine, the air turbine thing.

489
00:39:57,776 --> 00:40:10,487
[SPEAKER_02]: So that could be like a giveaway to give, you know, a solar powered battery for your phone or like a radio thing that has all like, you know, something that people want.

490
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:19,529
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think things like that would probably be more expensive.

491
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:24,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it would be better for us as like a prize for something rather than just a general.

492
00:40:24,897 --> 00:40:25,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

493
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:28,462
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen things that were like, um.

494
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,056
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they called?

495
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:44,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Like phase change materials kind of where it's some sort of, it's a thing that you wear around your neck, but if you put it under running water, it like freezes and then it will like stay cold for quite a while.

496
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:47,128
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that called?

497
00:40:47,148 --> 00:40:50,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember, but I can send you the link.

498
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:51,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

499
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:56,014
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to try it out before using it.

500
00:40:56,475 --> 00:40:56,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

501
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:22,048
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's good i i want to see like maybe before like we meet i can do a little bit more research of some things that we could use you know or we can get in and stuff that's like affordable and you know yep so we can give out yep um we had a game for the brazilian advance we did the scavenger hunt you know we did

502
00:41:22,865 --> 00:41:32,760
[SPEAKER_03]: animals from Brazil and that was a big hit with the kids, you know, maybe something like that that can educate the kids too, you know, like ways that it can

503
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:52,009
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, saying, you know, the word, you know, like, ride a bike, find a bike, or, you know, of course, you need to know what places it's going to be, and if they can find those kind of things, you know, or have a, or find three of those things that can, you know, represent how we can save a word or something like that.

504
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would be pretty cool.

505
00:41:55,546 --> 00:42:01,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like if we're looking for like stuff like that that's like involving kids and like information.

506
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:05,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw one day, I think it was on Instagram.

507
00:42:06,153 --> 00:42:10,495
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy like used his lawn to like do like cardboard, like

508
00:42:12,177 --> 00:42:12,957
[SPEAKER_02]: animal figures.

509
00:42:13,017 --> 00:42:24,086
[SPEAKER_02]: And like every day, there was like, an animal figure with like a cartoon animal figure that he does with like, what the animal is, what and where they live, like all the information about it.

510
00:42:24,466 --> 00:42:39,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be cool if like an event or whatever, we can use like, something like fun and interactive that's like, you know, we can make out a cardboard or something that has like, you know, a house and like a pop out book, like, you know, they open like the windows or like,

511
00:42:40,699 --> 00:43:02,336
[SPEAKER_02]: something to like be interactive to say okay this is what like this they use solar panels on the house you know what i'm i don't know if like i'm explaining myself oh that's cute it sounds like something like an advent calendar almost kind of yeah so like you could even do it for like a bunch of stuff even like stuff that's like for climate change you can do like

512
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:13,662
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the turbine and then open the turbine and you see what's inside and all that stuff and the information about it, you know, so it would be kind of fun to have those type of things.

513
00:43:15,223 --> 00:43:25,669
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a climate change series of like, stuff doesn't it ranges with everything.

514
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:28,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

515
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:50,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also thinking that we could make some sort of activity book as well, like, you know, I don't know, like I had that little like spot the differences thing and then we could do coloring and like, I don't know, word search or mazes, I don't know, things like that, that we could just make ourselves and it, that would be pretty simple.

516
00:43:51,577 --> 00:43:51,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

517
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:56,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they, you know, I was thinking, do they have any,

518
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:08,638
[SPEAKER_02]: like biodegradable like towels because i've seen like i don't know if you like i was saying that it'd be cool to like have to give out like um

519
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:20,041
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you can say like, maybe a one time use like towel that like, if you throw away, like, can be for like the trash, like for people who need to like, get washed.

520
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:32,553
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I'm saying is because unfortunately, we get a lot of like clients or customers in like Target, and like, some of them don't have a place to like shower, clean their face or anything like that.

521
00:44:32,593 --> 00:44:33,714
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be really cool to like,

522
00:44:34,174 --> 00:44:42,721
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, give out stuff like that that they can like, use and also so that when they throw out, it's not harmful for the environment.

523
00:44:42,741 --> 00:44:44,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I mean?

524
00:44:44,383 --> 00:44:48,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm just thinking of little things that we can like, use.

525
00:44:49,780 --> 00:45:11,915
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah cleaning like a wash up kind of thing yeah yeah have you seen have you seen guys um the towels that like are in like for example the dollar store that they're like really small and they're like compacted and then when you wet them they turn into a towel yeah do you know what i mean so i

526
00:45:15,326 --> 00:45:17,007
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Renee, you can go.

527
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:23,829
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was just gonna say, they're called like, I don't know, Norwegian washcloths or Scandinavian washcloths or something like that.

528
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:24,710
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've seen.

529
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've seen biodegradable ones.

530
00:45:28,511 --> 00:45:32,873
[SPEAKER_02]: They look so like, it'd be good to like give out, you know what I mean?

531
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:35,394
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me see if I can find it.

532
00:45:36,594 --> 00:45:36,994
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.

533
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:50,939
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we can, we can, I don't know when you free, Brenda, but maybe next week we can schedule something.

534
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:52,679
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds good.

535
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:53,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read that to you.

536
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:54,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

537
00:45:59,140 --> 00:45:59,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

538
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:05,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, there is look, Brenda, there's, there's like bamboo, vicos, fiber towels.

539
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:07,962
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like singles.

540
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:09,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is so interesting.

541
00:46:10,663 --> 00:46:11,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send all that stuff to you.

542
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:13,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

543
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:28,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how on brand it would be for Electrify Medford, just because it's not really saving energy or... Energy.

544
00:46:28,235 --> 00:46:29,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

545
00:46:29,395 --> 00:46:36,638
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I was thinking just because like, you know, sometimes like we give out stuff that's not really like,

546
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:37,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

547
00:46:38,043 --> 00:46:38,663
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

548
00:46:38,783 --> 00:46:45,245
[SPEAKER_02]: On brand, like, for example, we should be giving out like healthy snacks, but we give out like candy, health department.

549
00:46:45,645 --> 00:47:02,230
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just saying that it could be used like, you know, just a little like extra thing, obviously, like not give out like stuff that doesn't go with what we're, you know, yeah, going about it, at least just to spread the word out because you know, it could have the logo on it type thing, you know.

550
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:11,707
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we get lots of complaints after the Harvest Your Energy Festival because vendors will bring in their own giveaways.

551
00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:22,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be like, okay, I'm leaving this, my kids are leaving this festival with all kinds of plastic trash that they're just going to throw away when they get home.

552
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:25,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not very environmentally friendly.

553
00:47:25,893 --> 00:47:26,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

554
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:26,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

555
00:47:28,775 --> 00:47:29,475
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

556
00:47:36,877 --> 00:47:42,498
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's nothing else here, I think we can move into the electrify Medford training.

557
00:47:42,518 --> 00:47:52,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me share my screen here.

558
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:06,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you all see that?

559
00:48:08,283 --> 00:48:08,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

560
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:10,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.

561
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put this up here.

562
00:48:25,142 --> 00:48:36,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is a much shorter version of the nine-hour training that Electrify Medford coaches have done, but it still ended up being a lot.

563
00:48:37,171 --> 00:48:44,837
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually broke it up into two sections, and I thought we could do the first one today and the next one at the next meeting, if that works for you guys.

564
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds good.

565
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:51,156
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

566
00:48:51,717 --> 00:48:58,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it gives you a general idea of the technologies we're talking about, but still, it's still at a kind of a high level.

567
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:01,905
[SPEAKER_00]: So feel free to just to break in and ask questions anytime.

568
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:12,754
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, I sent you the link to the folder that the coaches have with all of the training materials in there.

569
00:49:13,394 --> 00:49:16,275
[SPEAKER_00]: and the decarbonization roadmap and all of that.

570
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:19,696
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great resource to go to if you have questions about this stuff.

571
00:49:19,816 --> 00:49:22,437
[SPEAKER_00]: The decarbonization roadmap is amazing.

572
00:49:24,538 --> 00:49:26,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I say I made it myself, so.

573
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:32,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you send in the chat, Brenda?

574
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not, but I emailed it to you guys.

575
00:49:34,401 --> 00:49:35,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me drop it in the chat now, too.

576
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:46,554
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, let me share this screen first so I can show you where it is.

577
00:49:46,574 --> 00:49:57,457
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

578
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:05,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll drop this link in the chat.

579
00:50:10,178 --> 00:50:12,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if that works for you.

580
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:15,825
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always worried about permissions for these shared folders.

581
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:23,274
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this folder, you've got all the flyers in here, like all the translations for the flyers.

582
00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:33,203
[SPEAKER_00]: These are decarbonization roadmaps for different residents who've gone through the program already.

583
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:43,570
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got all of the slides and the workbooks from the 9-hour training that the coaches did.

584
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:56,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've got a document with a bunch of links, um, to, you know, the resident sign up form and the city web page and the events calendar.

585
00:50:56,162 --> 00:51:01,967
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of that, and then we've got this decarbonization roadmap template.

586
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:08,233
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this is the document that I said that was so long and it has literally.

587
00:51:09,207 --> 00:51:12,929
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we're going to be sharing with residents, um.

588
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,611
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way that, you know, you can just click down through.

589
00:51:17,592 --> 00:51:27,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can't actually in this online version, if you download this to your own computer, you'll be able to click through from the table of contents into these different sections and it's got late information.

590
00:51:28,098 --> 00:51:31,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, a quick summary of different things and then a link to each 1 of them.

591
00:51:33,842 --> 00:51:42,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So this might just be a good resource for you anyway if you're talking to someone and they're talking about how they're behind on their national grid bills or something.

592
00:51:42,046 --> 00:51:45,027
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great resource for that.

593
00:51:46,828 --> 00:51:54,712
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also has lots of information about, you know, heat pumps and electric vehicles and insulation and all of that.

594
00:51:59,934 --> 00:52:01,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you guys able to get into that folder?

595
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:06,524
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you need permission.

596
00:52:06,544 --> 00:52:14,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I needed permission, but I was able to click on the link in the email and pull it up.

597
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:17,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.

598
00:52:17,411 --> 00:52:17,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

599
00:52:22,694 --> 00:52:29,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I won't waste time trying to correct that link now, but since you guys already have that in your email.

600
00:52:34,748 --> 00:52:37,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but so back to the back to the training.

601
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,475
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, yeah, this just.

602
00:52:41,516 --> 00:52:45,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the 1st, couple of pages of that of that road map, just pointing out that it's.

603
00:52:47,302 --> 00:52:52,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we want people to think of the big picture.

604
00:52:52,908 --> 00:52:59,831
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sequence things appropriately, because it matters what order you do some of these things in.

605
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:08,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also recognize that for a lot of things, people might want to wait until something is nearing the end of its useful life before replacing it.

606
00:53:08,695 --> 00:53:19,941
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, the focus would just be on planning for what you're going to do when that happens, so you're not faced with an emergency replacement and making a hasty decision that might be bad at that time.

607
00:53:29,547 --> 00:53:33,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, 1 thing I want to point out through electrify Medford.

608
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:37,353
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't make any recommendations about contractors.

609
00:53:38,914 --> 00:53:43,017
[SPEAKER_00]: If the city were to do that, we would have to be hiring a contractor to work with residents.

610
00:53:43,077 --> 00:53:45,519
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is not going to be sort of picking and choosing.

611
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:57,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Contractors that they'll recommend, but we do point people towards contractor lists that mass save and energy sage and others have so that they have these resources that they can go to.

612
00:53:58,454 --> 00:54:12,044
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just recommend that people get multiple quotes and then come to us or one of the technical consultants that we are pointing them to in here for help in understanding what those quotes are so that they can make a good decision.

613
00:54:21,994 --> 00:54:25,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick overview here.

614
00:54:25,097 --> 00:54:38,850
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're thinking about saving money on your energy costs or reducing your carbon footprint, there are so many options out there, but it really all boils down to be efficient, don't burn stuff, and don't use electricity made from burning stuff.

615
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:42,774
[SPEAKER_00]: So energy efficiency, electrification, and renewables.

616
00:54:46,435 --> 00:54:59,724
[SPEAKER_00]: Some options have a bigger impact than others, like weatherization, heat pumps, and solar panels, and driving less or driving an EV.

617
00:55:01,525 --> 00:55:04,948
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely do these things in a different order depending on what your priorities are.

618
00:55:04,988 --> 00:55:12,713
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing you really want to make sure that you do is to weatherize your home as much as possible before you install a heat pump.

619
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:18,871
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to think of a house as a system where everything is interacting with each other.

620
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:24,894
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, insulation and air sealing will affect ventilation, which affects heating.

621
00:55:25,494 --> 00:55:35,799
[SPEAKER_00]: And so weatherizing your home first will ensure that you're keeping as much of the heat inside your home in the winter as possible, so that the heat pump doesn't have to work as hard and that'll save you money.

622
00:55:40,306 --> 00:55:43,733
[SPEAKER_00]: So weatherization, it refers to air sealing and insulation.

623
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:49,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of air sealing like a windbreaker and insulation like a down coat.

624
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:56,221
[SPEAKER_00]: So one protects against air blowing through and the other protects against heat seeping out.

625
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:59,563
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the first thing that people should do and the cheapest.

626
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:11,232
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go through MassAve, air sealing is completely free and insulation is at least 75% off, sometimes completely free.

627
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:14,815
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good first step for people to take.

628
00:56:17,168 --> 00:56:28,592
[SPEAKER_00]: For air sealing in particular, leaks around your windows and doors can make your house feel drafty, but hidden leaks in your basement and your attic will create a chimney effect where cool air comes in from the bottom.

629
00:56:36,755 --> 00:56:38,356
[SPEAKER_00]: and hot air goes out the top.

630
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:44,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like a chimney would just running that air out of your house.

631
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,301
[SPEAKER_00]: And that costs a lot in heating bills.

632
00:56:47,062 --> 00:56:56,688
[SPEAKER_00]: And then vice versa in the summer, if you're cooling your house, the hot air will come in through the attic, drop down and go out the basement and same thing will happen.

633
00:56:58,629 --> 00:57:05,554
[SPEAKER_00]: So people tend to focus on their windows and doors when they're thinking about air sealing, but they shouldn't ignore their attics and their basements.

634
00:57:08,042 --> 00:57:11,290
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very interesting that you say that, Brenda.

635
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like my house does that.

636
00:57:14,779 --> 00:57:15,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I should tell my parents this.

637
00:57:16,985 --> 00:57:18,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

638
00:57:18,886 --> 00:57:32,557
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be hard for people to do the work in their attic, in their basement, just because sometimes they'll have so many things stored in there that it's hard to get to the things they need to do.

639
00:57:32,857 --> 00:57:41,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, in this picture, if you had a lot of things stored up in your attic, you'd have to remove it all before you could come in and do this air sealing and insulation.

640
00:57:42,104 --> 00:57:42,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

641
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,087
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can be a barrier sometimes.

642
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:57,147
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you say that the MassSave can cover the cost, is like an application that people can apply to get some financial assistance to get that done?

643
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:58,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does that work?

644
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:09,592
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would just, they would sign up to do a home energy assessment with MassSave and someone would come and look at their home and see exactly where there are opportunities to do this.

645
00:58:10,935 --> 00:58:18,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then they would assign their, the, a contractor to do this for you.

646
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:21,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't even have to look for a contractor to do it.

647
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,121
[SPEAKER_00]: They would assign a contractor.

648
00:58:23,721 --> 00:58:27,623
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't have to pay up front because they pay the contractor directly.

649
00:58:27,643 --> 00:58:27,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

650
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:32,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for air sealing, definitely.

651
00:58:33,091 --> 00:58:34,613
[SPEAKER_00]: For insulation, too, I think.

652
00:58:35,173 --> 00:58:42,918
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only paying if there's that 25% left over or less, depending on what your discount is.

653
00:58:44,439 --> 00:58:46,461
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the amount that you would pay in the end.

654
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,145
[SPEAKER_05]: How are these leaks detected?

655
00:58:53,526 --> 00:58:55,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just filling cracks, essentially?

656
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:57,954
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically.

657
00:58:58,014 --> 00:59:05,177
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would, well, A, they would look around the house to see if there are any obviously visible ones.

658
00:59:05,297 --> 00:59:10,340
[SPEAKER_00]: But also they have little, oh, I wish I had an image of this to show you.

659
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,881
[SPEAKER_00]: They have little thermal leak detectors.

660
00:59:14,642 --> 00:59:19,244
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they point this camera thing at the wall.

661
00:59:19,944 --> 00:59:24,667
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will show up in different colors depending on the temperature of the wall.

662
00:59:25,887 --> 00:59:32,133
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a really cold day, a place where there's a leak would show up as like bright blue.

663
00:59:33,955 --> 00:59:35,456
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how they would know.

664
00:59:35,476 --> 00:59:37,218
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool to see actually.

665
00:59:37,238 --> 00:59:45,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this air sealing, is it, I mean, would it be the same as like caulking or something like that or no?

666
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:47,406
[SPEAKER_05]: That's part of it, yeah.

667
00:59:47,486 --> 00:59:49,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Would caulking do the same thing?

668
00:59:49,246 --> 00:59:51,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that be considered air sealing?

669
00:59:52,127 --> 00:59:53,648
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, depending on where it is.

670
00:59:53,748 --> 00:59:59,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would do caulking around small leaks around doors and windows.

671
01:00:00,911 --> 01:00:03,112
[SPEAKER_00]: You would put in little weather stripping.

672
01:00:04,452 --> 01:00:08,574
[SPEAKER_00]: The little like door sweeps and stuff like that around doors and windows.

673
01:00:09,215 --> 01:00:15,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like this that you see here, that's called that spray foam that's used there and that's for bigger cracks.

674
01:00:16,678 --> 01:00:21,060
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they do is they spray the spray foam in there and then it expands.

675
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,782
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really fills in every crack in there.

676
01:00:24,822 --> 01:00:26,883
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, it's really good for bigger cracks like that.

677
01:00:28,955 --> 01:00:34,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, is that stuff safe for animals and children?

678
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:40,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that one of those things, it's up in the attic sort of thing.

679
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:43,743
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't really expect the kids and the pets to be up there.

680
01:00:44,403 --> 01:00:46,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it off gases while they're doing it.

681
01:00:46,984 --> 01:00:49,946
[SPEAKER_00]: So the person who's installing it would be wearing a mask.

682
01:00:50,026 --> 01:00:54,588
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would probably want to clear out while they're actually installing it.

683
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:56,569
[SPEAKER_00]: But afterwards, it's not a problem.

684
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:06,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have a lot of seniors in my street, and they are complaining it's too hot or too cold.

685
01:01:06,616 --> 01:01:07,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll check it.

686
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:11,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to check it out, see if that's going to be a possibility to help them out.

687
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:13,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

688
01:01:21,439 --> 01:01:28,403
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for insulation, we're not just again, we're not just talking about walls, but we're talking about the basement and the attic too.

689
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,607
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thicker your insulation is, the better it'll work.

690
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:41,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Different types of insulation have different capabilities at the same thickness.

691
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:47,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that that your installer will consider when they're when they're looking at your situation.

692
01:01:48,974 --> 01:01:56,218
[SPEAKER_00]: This here shows an attic with blown in cellulose insulation, which is one of the more effective types of insulation at the.

693
01:01:57,353 --> 01:01:58,634
[SPEAKER_00]: same thickness levels, you know.

694
01:01:59,054 --> 01:02:05,278
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is looking at, you know, an older home tends not to have that much insulation in it.

695
01:02:05,959 --> 01:02:16,846
[SPEAKER_00]: If you fill up in your attic to the level of the joists, the wooden beams that are sticking up there, it's still not enough insulation.

696
01:02:16,906 --> 01:02:26,152
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have insulation that actually goes over those beams to a particular height in order to really work for our climate.

697
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:33,874
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a couple of the most common types of insulation.

698
01:02:33,914 --> 01:02:36,496
[SPEAKER_00]: There's blown-in cellulose insulation.

699
01:02:36,976 --> 01:02:41,980
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing about that is that it's really small and it settles together, so it's much denser.

700
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can do a better job at insulating.

701
01:02:46,444 --> 01:02:56,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also fiberglass insulation, which is a little bit easier to install because it comes in these bats that they will, you know, sort of shove down into the,

702
01:02:56,793 --> 01:02:58,614
[SPEAKER_00]: into the cavities and the walls and the floor.

703
01:02:58,634 --> 01:03:07,617
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's not quite as effective at the same thickness level, but it can be, it can go in some situations where the blown in cellulose can't.

704
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:15,980
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

705
01:03:17,435 --> 01:03:32,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the idea of the home as a system, if you insulate and you air seal your house, you tighten that building envelope so it's losing very little air and very little heat, you'll need to ventilate it by putting in a mechanical fan.

706
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, moisture will build up, and you could have issues with mold.

707
01:03:43,763 --> 01:03:56,619
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to insulate and air seal and ventilate so that you have control over it rather than just leaving your house leaky and not knowing how leaky it is or like that.

708
01:03:56,659 --> 01:03:58,902
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better to have control over it by doing these things.

709
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:08,687
[SPEAKER_00]: For most houses, a bathroom fan and a fan above your cook stove is sufficient as long as they're venting outside.

710
01:04:09,427 --> 01:04:25,773
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a really, really tight building envelope, like passive house level, you can get something called an ERV or an energy recovery ventilator that takes the heat in the air that you're venting outside and uses it to warm up the air that's coming in.

711
01:04:28,226 --> 01:04:36,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems complicated, but if you're building a house to passive house levels, you have engineers involved who will design the ERV into that system.

712
01:04:38,907 --> 01:04:56,054
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say that like bathroom fans and Phantom of your cook stove is sufficient for most houses now, as part of the building code, bathroom fans now, new bathroom fans, now have to continuously operate.

713
01:04:56,674 --> 01:05:02,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be running at a very low level that I think you can't even hear all the time.

714
01:05:02,516 --> 01:05:03,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you turn them on,

715
01:05:04,377 --> 01:05:07,920
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll ramp up to blow it out really hard.

716
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:12,303
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time, it's just running at a very, very low level.

717
01:05:19,629 --> 01:05:29,557
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after doing all of this work to your building envelope and before choosing a new heating system, your installer should do a heat load calculation.

718
01:05:29,577 --> 01:05:32,979
[SPEAKER_00]: That's referred to by them as a manual J.

719
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:40,783
[SPEAKER_00]: because your heating system won't be efficient and won't be as comfortable if it's too large or too small for your house.

720
01:05:41,363 --> 01:05:44,765
[SPEAKER_00]: So too small, it'll struggle to keep you warm on the coldest days of the year.

721
01:05:45,365 --> 01:05:59,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Too large, you'll be going through a cycle where it immediately gets up to temperature and then turns off or you have to turn it off and then it gets cold and then it turns on again and immediately gets up to temperature and turns off again.

722
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:03,233
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's uncomfortable for you and it wastes a lot of money and energy.

723
01:06:04,315 --> 01:06:08,679
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you need is like the Goldilocks situation where it's just the right size.

724
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:20,348
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you insulate and air seal your home your heating system doesn't need to be as large, but a lot of contractors can be kind of lazy about this and just put in the same size system that you had before.

725
01:06:22,618 --> 01:06:26,541
[SPEAKER_00]: They only sell a particular brand of heating system and it only comes in certain sizes.

726
01:06:26,621 --> 01:06:30,804
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you talk to three different contractors, you'll get three completely different recommendations.

727
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:38,669
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we really want you to do is to talk to us and talk to the technical consultants that we'll put you in touch with to make sure you have the right system for your home.

728
01:06:46,196 --> 01:06:50,578
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about electrification, we're mainly talking about heat pumps.

729
01:06:50,598 --> 01:06:53,099
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll do a deeper dive into those today.

730
01:06:53,119 --> 01:07:04,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Heat pumps work like a refrigerator, basically, pulling heat out of the air, even if it's very cold air, and transferring it to your house.

731
01:07:05,165 --> 01:07:08,287
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, it does the same thing, but in the opposite direction.

732
01:07:08,387 --> 01:07:10,929
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get both heating and cooling with 1 system.

733
01:07:11,689 --> 01:07:14,451
[SPEAKER_00]: And these systems consist of an outside unit.

734
01:07:15,632 --> 01:07:20,495
[SPEAKER_00]: And an inside unit, which can be either on the wall on the floor on the ceiling.

735
01:07:20,515 --> 01:07:26,579
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be even ducted actually.

736
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:30,662
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you have, like, a furnace with ducks, you could be attach it to that instead.

737
01:07:35,443 --> 01:07:42,965
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that this works, there's a very cold refrigerant, which is colder than the outside air in the winter.

738
01:07:43,485 --> 01:07:49,226
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will absorb heat from the air and then it gets compressed, raising the pressure.

739
01:07:49,246 --> 01:07:54,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the atoms are knocking against each other in a smaller space, it heats up even more.

740
01:07:54,447 --> 01:08:00,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's pumped inside your house and your inside air absorbs the heat from that.

741
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:06,332
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's pumped back outside, where it expands into a bigger space and cools off.

742
01:08:07,153 --> 01:08:10,393
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can absorb more heat, and then the cycle starts again.

743
01:08:10,413 --> 01:08:16,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the summer, it flips around, so it's doing it in the opposite direction.

744
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:26,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the heat pump's moving heat from one location to another rather than creating heat, it can be more than three times as efficient as other heating systems.

745
01:08:32,138 --> 01:08:40,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in Massachusetts, you really want to make sure to get a cold climate heat pump, which is rated down to 5 degrees.

746
01:08:41,447 --> 01:08:43,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see here, there are 2 models.

747
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:48,314
[SPEAKER_00]: 1 is not cold climate and 1 is cold climate.

748
01:08:48,794 --> 01:08:50,836
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same capacity at 47 degrees.

749
01:08:53,102 --> 01:08:58,126
[SPEAKER_00]: But at negative 13 degrees, the one on the left's capacity drops by half.

750
01:08:59,187 --> 01:09:01,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get really cold if you're in that house.

751
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:14,098
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also one of the reasons to make sure that a heat load calculation is done by your installer to make sure that you have enough capacity to heat your house at any time of year.

752
01:09:14,118 --> 01:09:14,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so...

753
01:09:21,914 --> 01:09:22,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

754
01:09:22,494 --> 01:09:24,335
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think that's it right now.

755
01:09:24,355 --> 01:09:31,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask about these heat pumps.

756
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:39,381
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the heat pumps, do you have both heating and cooling, or do you have one or the other?

757
01:09:39,401 --> 01:09:41,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know what I mean?

758
01:09:42,122 --> 01:09:43,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you have just one?

759
01:09:44,183 --> 01:09:45,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Both heating and cooling.

760
01:09:45,323 --> 01:09:46,384
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are they together?

761
01:09:47,136 --> 01:09:47,316
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

762
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:50,419
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both heating and cooling because it's the same process.

763
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:53,902
[SPEAKER_00]: You just flip which direction it's going.

764
01:09:55,563 --> 01:10:00,207
[SPEAKER_00]: In the summer, it goes in one direction and then it flips and goes in the other direction in the winter.

765
01:10:01,548 --> 01:10:11,016
[SPEAKER_05]: This is essentially like central heating, central air and heating, but way more efficient.

766
01:10:12,094 --> 01:10:26,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, and so you have to have those ducts and stuff in all the rooms or all rooms of your house, or I guess, or does it, is it, I guess it would be based, would it be based on the layout of your house?

767
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:33,594
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have like an open kind of thing, then, you know, you probably have this huge, you know, much larger thing.

768
01:10:34,054 --> 01:10:34,695
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay.

769
01:10:35,215 --> 01:10:35,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

770
01:10:35,716 --> 01:10:36,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

771
01:10:36,176 --> 01:10:37,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the,

772
01:10:39,877 --> 01:10:45,159
[SPEAKER_00]: The installations can be very, very different depending on the layout of the person's house.

773
01:10:45,339 --> 01:10:55,763
[SPEAKER_00]: In my house, we live on the third floor, so we just have ducts in the attic that go to all of the rooms in our house, and we have a central heat pump.

774
01:10:57,224 --> 01:11:01,525
[SPEAKER_00]: My boss's house, she has a two-floor house.

775
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:08,891
[SPEAKER_00]: So she has that for the top floor, she has ducks in the attic going into her second floor.

776
01:11:09,371 --> 01:11:11,734
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the first floor, she has mini splits.

777
01:11:11,774 --> 01:11:14,476
[SPEAKER_00]: So those separate heads in each room.

778
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:18,000
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have like a mixture of the two as well.

779
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:20,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

780
01:11:22,384 --> 01:11:26,007
[SPEAKER_03]: And would that replace the heat or the air conditioner?

781
01:11:26,748 --> 01:11:27,689
[SPEAKER_00]: It would replace both.

782
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:28,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

783
01:11:29,595 --> 01:11:29,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

784
01:11:30,915 --> 01:11:39,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just going to ask if like, if you could, would they utilize current ductwork that's already in the house?

785
01:11:42,259 --> 01:11:51,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Potentially, or would they have to, would it have to be something brand new, routed, you know, or whatever?

786
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:52,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know.

787
01:11:52,883 --> 01:11:55,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it depends if the ductwork is big enough.

788
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:57,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually,

789
01:11:59,055 --> 01:12:02,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Contractors in the past have definitely oversized ducts.

790
01:12:03,397 --> 01:12:08,358
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you install a heat pump, it can use these older oversized ducts.

791
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:17,602
[SPEAKER_00]: If the ducts were like exactly sized for like your air conditioning, for instance, that's a smaller load than your heating would be.

792
01:12:18,122 --> 01:12:20,323
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need smaller ducts for that.

793
01:12:20,643 --> 01:12:24,084
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you put in a heat pump for heating with those ducts, you would need bigger ones.

794
01:12:24,604 --> 01:12:26,385
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on what you have already.

795
01:12:27,445 --> 01:12:31,586
[SPEAKER_00]: and the installer would tell you whether your ducts are big enough for that or not.

796
01:12:31,946 --> 01:12:39,448
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I have ducts coming, you know, coming up out of the heat, heat coming up out of the floor and stuff.

797
01:12:41,629 --> 01:12:42,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.

798
01:12:43,289 --> 01:12:45,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's different for every situation.

799
01:12:45,390 --> 01:12:48,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it depends on the house and sure.

800
01:12:49,391 --> 01:12:51,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

801
01:12:52,212 --> 01:12:52,772
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing.

802
01:12:54,412 --> 01:13:03,898
[SPEAKER_00]: People would definitely have cost savings if you switch from oil, propane, or electric resistance, like electric baseboard, to heat pumps.

803
01:13:04,638 --> 01:13:17,607
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're switching from natural gas, it could actually cost more, depending on a bunch of different things, from what electric rate you have, to the quality of the installation that was done, to how you use it.

804
01:13:18,027 --> 01:13:19,188
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about the same.

805
01:13:20,128 --> 01:13:26,293
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on how on a lot of different factors, the heat pump could cost more compared to natural gas.

806
01:13:27,013 --> 01:13:33,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking to people through Electrify Medford, we want to make sure that they're aware of that.

807
01:13:33,838 --> 01:13:41,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's something that they are concerned about, that they are thinking about that ahead of time and are factoring that into their decision making process.

808
01:13:42,784 --> 01:13:48,689
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people keep their old natural gas heating system and use that on the coldest days of the year.

809
01:13:49,329 --> 01:13:57,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can save money that way because the heat pump is more efficient than natural gas most of the year.

810
01:13:57,839 --> 01:14:07,530
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just on those very coldest days that like the natural gas can be cheaper because of not more efficient, but cheaper because of what the rates are now.

811
01:14:10,562 --> 01:14:17,568
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you keep your old natural gas heating system, then you're also spending money to maintain two heating systems.

812
01:14:17,609 --> 01:14:20,351
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure that that works out in the end really either.

813
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:26,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something that people have to be aware of if they're thinking about this and they have natural gas.

814
01:14:37,892 --> 01:14:40,754
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, Natasha just joined.

815
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:54,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Natasha, I just finished doing the first part of the training for the Electrify Medford thing.

816
01:14:58,429 --> 01:15:02,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I can send I'll definitely send the slides out to everyone and we can talk about it some more.

817
01:15:03,912 --> 01:15:13,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time to, um, when we do the 2nd, half of the training, where we talk about, you know, all the, the solar and the electric vehicles and and other things too.

818
01:15:13,697 --> 01:15:19,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Brenda.

819
01:15:20,621 --> 01:15:21,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, any.

820
01:15:23,748 --> 01:15:29,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Other questions about like insulation, air sealing, heat pumps?

821
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:36,811
[SPEAKER_02]: No, to be honest, that's really good information to have for yourself as well as like anyone else.

822
01:15:38,011 --> 01:15:38,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like it.

823
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:40,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say too.

824
01:15:40,132 --> 01:15:42,933
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a good material for us to share.

825
01:15:42,953 --> 01:15:48,234
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that kind of information, I think, is the kind of information people that go to those events

826
01:15:49,227 --> 01:15:50,688
[SPEAKER_03]: they would be interested to hear.

827
01:15:51,448 --> 01:15:57,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Because even though if they don't own a house, they can talk to their landlord about those possibilities, you know?

828
01:15:58,572 --> 01:15:59,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, definitely.

829
01:16:00,413 --> 01:16:08,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, I mean, through Electrify Medfar, we're encouraging renters to give us their landlord's contact information so that we can talk to their landlords.

830
01:16:09,058 --> 01:16:17,343
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if their landlord has more, lots of detailed questions about things, we can talk to them about it instead of trying to go between with the renter.

831
01:16:18,508 --> 01:16:34,372
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and a lot of this information is in that decarbonization roadmap.

832
01:16:34,412 --> 01:16:38,153
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a good reference for you to go back to if you have any questions too.

833
01:16:38,173 --> 01:16:38,213
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,

834
01:16:49,423 --> 01:16:52,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it for this first part of the training.

835
01:16:53,866 --> 01:17:06,215
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other thing I see on the agenda is possible future meeting topics.

836
01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:17,263
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of things that we had talked about last time.

837
01:17:21,663 --> 01:17:24,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one we'll do, obviously, the second part of this training.

838
01:17:28,366 --> 01:17:31,047
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, let's see.

839
01:17:31,067 --> 01:17:38,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things we had mentioned maybe once before was green jobs.

840
01:17:40,672 --> 01:17:44,854
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of training programs out there that people could take advantage of.

841
01:17:48,331 --> 01:18:07,323
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, maybe we can check out some stuff that we have in our priority list for 2024, especially with the winter approaching, you know, and maybe come up with some material or some, even like a workshop or something that it can provide those information to, to the residents.

842
01:18:07,423 --> 01:18:09,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be a good thing to do.

843
01:18:10,845 --> 01:18:15,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It concerns me a lot during the winter time, you know, people that cannot afford heat or,

844
01:18:16,235 --> 01:18:23,463
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have any kind of heat system and then they choose other ways to keep warm, especially the seniors.

845
01:18:23,543 --> 01:18:28,168
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think any information and help we can provide to all of them.

846
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:31,912
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.

847
01:18:32,593 --> 01:18:34,495
[SPEAKER_00]: I had someone come to me this week.

848
01:18:34,896 --> 01:18:35,837
[SPEAKER_00]: It broke my heart.

849
01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:36,097
[SPEAKER_00]: She

850
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:49,719
[SPEAKER_00]: She was having a lot of issues right now because she had cancer, but she got hit with a $600 electric bill in July.

851
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:55,904
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was blaming the Medford electricity aggregation for it.

852
01:18:56,645 --> 01:19:02,870
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I dug into it, it looked like there was just a lot of electric usage in her house.

853
01:19:04,091 --> 01:19:21,661
[SPEAKER_00]: I was saying to her, well, you should have National Grid check out your meter to make sure it's not broken first, and then have Mass Save come in to take a look at the opportunities for reducing your energy use and what rebates and incentives are available that way.

854
01:19:21,681 --> 01:19:28,965
[SPEAKER_00]: And she wouldn't listen to me, and she just asked to be removed from the aggregation, which actually increased her electric bill.

855
01:19:30,046 --> 01:19:38,499
[SPEAKER_00]: from, what is it, from 15 cents per kilowatt hour to 16 cents per kilowatt hour.

856
01:19:38,519 --> 01:19:41,744
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could not convince her and it was so heartbreaking.

857
01:19:50,303 --> 01:19:52,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder, was she in a house or an apartment?

858
01:19:53,168 --> 01:19:54,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, she was in a house.

859
01:19:54,591 --> 01:19:56,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Air conditioners.

860
01:19:56,775 --> 01:20:01,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it notice, like, does she see it substantially when, like, her bill comes in?

861
01:20:04,622 --> 01:20:08,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'll depend because the temperature dropped.

862
01:20:08,263 --> 01:20:12,564
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next month, she probably wasn't going to be using as much air conditioning.

863
01:20:12,985 --> 01:20:17,426
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to look like her bill came down because of her aggregation.

864
01:20:17,486 --> 01:20:21,847
[SPEAKER_00]: If she doesn't look at the rates, she's just going to say, oh, good thing I did that.

865
01:20:23,288 --> 01:20:25,148
[SPEAKER_01]: So then wait till next year.

866
01:20:25,808 --> 01:20:26,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

867
01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:29,509
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be knocking on your door, Brenda, and say, I'm sorry.

868
01:20:31,977 --> 01:20:37,580
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but I think the lack of information that people have to, you know, I had to help people like that.

869
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:38,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I work all day.

870
01:20:39,021 --> 01:20:40,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just at home at night.

871
01:20:40,842 --> 01:20:41,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

872
01:20:41,623 --> 01:20:44,344
[SPEAKER_03]: My bill is $400, $500, you know?

873
01:20:44,784 --> 01:20:48,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, we can call, we can call and ask them to check your meter.

874
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:53,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And people don't know those things that they are allowed to do those things, you know?

875
01:20:55,548 --> 01:20:57,489
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is a lot of assistance over there too.

876
01:20:57,569 --> 01:21:02,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I always encourage people to do the national grade payment plan that it is fixed amount.

877
01:21:02,532 --> 01:21:04,253
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have any surprises in a month.

878
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:05,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I always did that.

879
01:21:05,874 --> 01:21:14,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I never want to have a $400 bill, you know, like you'll never know, maybe, you know, you're not working as many hours or whatever.

880
01:21:14,838 --> 01:21:16,499
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always did that the fixed amount.

881
01:21:16,539 --> 01:21:19,121
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that's my budget every month, you know?

882
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:20,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

883
01:21:20,562 --> 01:21:22,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was encouraged people to do that, but there are so many,

884
01:21:24,198 --> 01:21:29,342
[SPEAKER_03]: resource out there that people don't know.

885
01:21:29,563 --> 01:21:30,744
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to do here.

886
01:21:30,764 --> 01:21:51,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I think part of it is, I don't necessarily think that it's as useful for us to just be putting it out there to tell people all of this stuff all the time, but when they come to us asking for specific questions that we can pull out the information and help them with it.

887
01:21:58,093 --> 01:22:01,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're at 7 o'clock.

888
01:22:01,235 --> 01:22:03,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be respectful of everybody's time.

889
01:22:03,297 --> 01:22:06,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything else that folks wanted to talk about today?

890
01:22:06,519 --> 01:22:18,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hear anything.

891
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:18,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

892
01:22:19,587 --> 01:22:24,711
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that means that we need to do a. A vote to close the meeting.

893
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:30,540
[SPEAKER_05]: I motion to close the meeting tonight.

894
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:41,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I try to click the button, let me do it.

895
01:22:41,982 --> 01:22:44,123
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I take so long to unmute.

896
01:22:45,023 --> 01:22:45,643
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.

897
01:22:46,043 --> 01:22:48,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, motion to end the meeting.

898
01:22:50,124 --> 01:22:53,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Stacy already did the motion and Samia seconded it.

899
01:22:53,605 --> 01:22:55,245
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's just going to the vote.

900
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:04,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I. I. I. I. See, Natasha has a thumbs up there.

901
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,861
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that's an I. So I think we're all set.

902
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:08,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.
