Mr. Efford, if you'd give us a short presentation and then we will open the hearings.

30
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:14,169
Good evening all.

31
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,132
We simply want to extend our hours to 1 a.m.

32
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:21,954
I'm not saying that we actually will open until 1 a.m.

33
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:22,834
on seven nights a week.

34
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:25,096
We will do so when the need arises.

35
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:32,640
But, you know, there are times with, you know, the Celtics last week or the week before last, you know, it runs past 11 a.m.

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:32,880
or 11 p.m.

37
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:39,502
and we're in a situation where we have to close early and ask people to leave before the game's over.

38
00:02:40,542 --> 00:02:41,422
So we'd like to avoid that.

39
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:43,283
Thank you, Mr. Rafferty.

40
00:02:43,843 --> 00:02:48,604
As this is a public hearing, I'm opening the public hearing to people in favor of the petition.

41
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:50,424
Could you give us your name and address?

42
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:53,644
Barry Rafferty, 51 Crocker Road, Medford.

43
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:54,065
Thank you.

44
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,865
Anyone else in favor of the petition?

45
00:02:57,265 --> 00:02:58,965
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

46
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,966
Now open to anyone in opposition to the petition.

47
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,712
Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

48
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,374
Now open it to members of the council for questions.

49
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:11,395
Councilor Knight.

50
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:14,218
Mr. President, first of all, I'd like to thank Mr. Rafferty for being here this evening.

51
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:16,740
He's actually here at our behest and our request.

52
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,144
Previously, he was here before us to get a common victuals license to open up his restaurant.

53
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:26,889
And we had a little bit of discussion about what was gonna be in the menu and the like, and where it's an establishment that serves alcohol.

54
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,953
He has received a alcohol permit from liquor licensing commission.

55
00:03:31,532 --> 00:03:42,517
That license goes to one and but I am city of Medford in order to get extended hours need to come before the council so Mister Rafferty and his wisdom is actually following the protocols and processes that are in place here in the community.

56
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,158
I commend him for complying.

57
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,019
I am someone who really likes to sell it to make it thrown out the middle of the game.

58
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,241
So I certainly support this measure wholeheartedly from what I understand.

59
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:56,183
It has been quite a buzz about the business around the community a lot of people are

60
00:03:56,623 --> 00:03:58,504
saying good things about it, and I wish you the best of luck, sir.

61
00:03:58,844 --> 00:04:04,246
It's also very nice to see someone who resides in the community to invest their hard-earned dollars in this community and open up a business here.

62
00:04:04,266 --> 00:04:15,932
So, me as one counselor, and I'm sure my colleagues behind the rail, I'm more than happy and willing to help you out in any endeavor that you need moving forward to make sure that this is a smooth transition for you as you open this establishment.

63
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:20,407
but I support a lot of Mr. President, I'd offer the motion to waive the waiting period.

64
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:23,309
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

65
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,089
Councilor Scarpelli.

66
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:25,530
Thank you, Mr. President.

67
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,291
I appreciate Mr. Rafferty.

68
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:32,094
I know I'll support the second Councilor Knight's motion to waive and move forward.

69
00:04:32,634 --> 00:04:39,378
I hope you'll be in front of the council asking for a special time permit for the World Cup in Dubai.

70
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:41,539
So if we can open up at two in the morning,

71
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:44,555
and close at 10 in the morning.

72
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:45,556
I appreciate it.

73
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:46,197
So thank you.

74
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:46,937
Thank you.

75
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:48,359
If you can, thanks.

76
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,981
We won't be watching Italy, but.

77
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:54,284
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

78
00:04:54,464 --> 00:05:00,710
On the motion of Councilor Knight to waive the public comment period and approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

79
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,172
Any further discussion?

80
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:04,836
All those in favor?

81
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:06,077
Opposed?

82
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:07,698
Motion passes.

83
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:08,718
Thank you.

84
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,740
I'd like now to go just if we could.

85
00:05:16,802 --> 00:05:17,542
Yes, exactly.

86
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:24,386
So I'd like to move to a public participation for folks who were, basically we had to move to our regular meeting on Zoom.

87
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:33,050
So if there's anyone on public participation at this point who'd like to speak to the public schools budget, anyone who'd like to speak in public participation to the school's budget?

88
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,334
Any hands online?

89
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:37,114
I have one hand online.

90
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:43,436
Paul Garrity, please give your name and address for the record.

91
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:45,596
Good evening.

92
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,796
My name is Paul Garrity.

93
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:50,877
I live at Cedar Road in Medford, Mass.

94
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,477
Basically, it's a little bit broader.

95
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:55,478
It includes the school budget as well as the city budgets.

96
00:05:56,558 --> 00:06:03,119
I wanted to speak specifically to the recommendations Councilor Bear brought forward at the June 14th meeting

97
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,074
There was a couple of portions.

98
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:07,396
One was the addressing the long term budget needs.

99
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,078
I am in full agreement with that.

100
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:21,189
We really need to have a systematic process to capture, analyze, plan and manage the delivering in the cost of all city services and school activities.

101
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:29,257
And further, I believe that we need to institute a long term revenue policy

102
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:53,397
Many times we've, you know, had discussions with counselors, indicating that a long term plan might resolve or itself around a redevelopment authority or something along that side that could develop the resources Mr gab could look at the status of their rights of Wellington circle and basically allow the city to start to control its own destiny by controlling land uses.

103
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:57,710
Why I brought the two long-term, it brought me to the short-term.

104
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:14,721
I really believe that making rash decisions right now, given the fact that we seem to be up against the wall, I seriously believe that what I'm looking at here is a short-term budget deficit trying to be resolved with a possible long-term permanent tax increase.

105
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:20,485
I would offer that we look at a short-term deficit with a short-term solution.

106
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:21,746
Can we identify the funds?

107
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:31,990
and whether it be free cash, unused budgets, ARPA funds, whatever, and apply them first.

108
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:39,297
And I think at that point, we need to take a serious look at, do we deliver what's mandated and obligated on the contract to be delivered?

109
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:40,178
Thank you.

110
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,401
Thank you, Mr. Geraghty.

111
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:49,867
I see Adam with their hand raised.

112
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:55,870
Please give us your full name and address for the record, please.

113
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,131
Hi, my name's Jessica Healy, Four Lock Road in Medford.

114
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:09,216
I just had a question about the budget for the school and wondering if we, or if they put in any budget regarding security for the schools.

115
00:08:11,017 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm kind of concerned when I heard Mr. Murphy say, when Mr. Carviello asked about

116
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:20,368
You know, how are the locks in the schools, the cameras?

117
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,770
And he said that we could continue to improve on that.

118
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,092
We don't have time to improve on that.

119
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:32,814
We have to improve on it now with everything going on, God forbid anything ever happened.

120
00:08:35,055 --> 00:08:40,978
You know, my son's school, the Brooks School, a year or two ago, someone did walk into the school.

121
00:08:41,859 --> 00:08:43,500
Thankfully, the guy,

122
00:08:44,526 --> 00:08:46,548
didn't have any bad intention in that way.

123
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:56,318
They were able to get him to leave, but he was very upset, walked right in the school and with the kids during recess coming in.

124
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:07,710
So I don't know if anyone's looking into the guardian program or that they have down in Florida and in Texas.

125
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:10,028
I don't know if anyone's looking into that.

126
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:14,570
But I don't know if anyone's thinking of a budget for security at the schools.

127
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,111
Thank you.

128
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:17,252
Thank you, Justine.

129
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:22,215
I can personally just from reading the book, I know that there is money budgeted for security.

130
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,576
I do also know there was a reluctance around specifics.

131
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:29,899
I don't know if members of our school administration would like to maybe provide any further context to this question.

132
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:39,304
I do think nation was to avoid specifics for very clear reasons point of information.

133
00:09:40,185 --> 00:09:43,286
I think that is important that we're very delicate when it comes to.

134
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,268
I know some people want specifics and that's very dangerous to do.

135
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:51,730
I know Mr. Murphy, which are saying so it's not, we have to understand that.

136
00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:00,293
We can't get into details of our security protocol because all we're doing is announcing possibly to the people with bad intentions.

137
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,394
So we have to be very careful.

138
00:10:01,754 --> 00:10:03,314
It's a fine line that we have to walk.

139
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:10,437
So I just wanna share that with all the viewers and the people that are here, just be understanding with that.

140
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:11,597
I know what we're saying.

141
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,418
We are looking, we ask questions about security.

142
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,340
It is a priority both I think for the city council and the school committee.

143
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,821
So I just wanted to share my view with that.

144
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:21,141
Thank you.

145
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:22,559
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

146
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,000
Maybe Mr. Murphy, as you answer, you can provide some context.

147
00:10:25,161 --> 00:10:36,509
I wanna thank Councilor Scarpelli for elucidating that point because that is in fact why I was reluctant in our earlier session to get into any greater specificity.

148
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:49,478
And my comment in response to Councilor Carvilla was that this is something that we always need to be continuously improving because there are risks and there are threats that evolve over time.

149
00:10:49,878 --> 00:11:02,020
And so there will never reach a point at which we can say, we have now solved our security, and I would say we have a security issues per se but we've solved the security issue we we don't we never have to revisit and I believe we'll look at a capital.

150
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:16,210
Correct, yeah, and from a budgeting perspective, a lot of the investments that we will make over the coming fiscal year to improve our security structure will be on the capital expense side, which is why it's not necessarily itemized within the operating budget.

151
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:32,299
But again, to Councilor Scarpelli's point, there's a significant amount of investment and work that we do to ensure that our school communities are safe, and there are pieces of that that we talk about and identify publicly, and there are pieces of it that we do not for the exact reasons that Councilor Scarpelli said.

152
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:33,922
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

153
00:11:33,962 --> 00:11:38,065
Could you just give your email in case anyone has follow-up questions that may be able to be answered outside of a public session?

154
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:39,165
Absolutely.

155
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:40,686
And so my email, you said?

156
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:41,146
Yes.

157
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:45,449
dmurphy, as in David Murphy, at medford.k12.ma.us.

158
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:57,975
It's also on the Medford Public Schools website and certainly can reach out to myself or any building principal, all of our school administrators who I know our families and caregivers are very familiar with and have ongoing discourse and conversation with.

159
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:02,698
All of our building administrators are eager to talk with families to make sure that they

160
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:10,725
that their students are not just safe, but their families know that they're safe and feel safe, so that they can thrive in the learning environments in which they are going to school.

161
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:12,126
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

162
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:16,410
Any further public comment regarding the Metro Public Schools budget at this time?

163
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:19,132
Not seeing any.

164
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:24,537
We will, of course, be meeting next week as well, and we invite all public participation at all of our meetings.

165
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:27,499
Yes.

166
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:33,534
Yes, paper 22-388.

167
00:12:33,574 --> 00:12:37,622
Yes, of course, paper 22-388 under suspension.

168
00:12:44,834 --> 00:13:04,347
Mister to be says managing agent for Simmons properties LLC which owns the property is known as 196 on 200 Boston Avenue, therefore known as the properties Cummings properties LLC requests that the city changes owning district destination for the properties from industrial to office to please advise as to whether you will require any additional action or information from the owner and connection petition.

169
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:10,010
and readily available should questions or other reasons for further discussion arise.

170
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,970
Thank you sincerely.

171
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,212
Cummings Properties LLC, Derek Russell, Vice President of Operations.

172
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:20,335
And again, this is the 196 and 200 Boston Avenue Properties.

173
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,657
Name and address for the record, please.

174
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:26,578
Hi, my name is Michael Levaney.

175
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:29,280
My address is on 200 West Cummings Park.

176
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,902
I'm here tonight representing Cummings Properties.

177
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:39,872
who represents Simmons Properties LLC on behalf of the Cummings Foundation.

178
00:13:40,732 --> 00:14:03,010
Yes, and consistent with what you just said, consistent with our June 22nd letter to the city clerk, we respectfully request that the city council change the zoning district designation for the properties at 196 and 200 Boston Ave from industrial as they are today to the newly created office two district.

179
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:20,551
As you may be aware, we at Cummings Properties considered a redevelopment project at 200 Boston Ave just last year, and this zoning district change could be beneficial when the time comes for us to reconsider that project again.

180
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:26,675
So I'd be happy to answer any questions that the council may have on our request.

181
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:28,437
Thank you.

182
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:31,099
I'll go to Councilor Knight, then Councilor Kerrio.

183
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:35,607
Mr. President, thank you very much, Mr. Deveney of any of any being here today.

184
00:14:36,328 --> 00:14:44,119
Mr. President, by way of history, I believe this O2 district was something that we created the rezoning recodification and first one in 60 years.

185
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:44,940
Right.

186
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,324
And it was, um, well, we did stations landing.

187
00:14:49,738 --> 00:14:55,322
This parcel was actually the parcel that we had in mind when we started discussing this about a redevelopment opportunity.

188
00:14:55,882 --> 00:15:02,067
Councilor Caviello and our economic development director spoke at great length about what we can do to bring biotech into this community.

189
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:09,792
And one of the things was to create this office two district and create some dimensional requirements that might meet some of the needs that developers like this gentleman have.

190
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:17,798
I was wondering if you could tell us how many number of jobs this would create in construction and also permanently once the facility is complete.

191
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:18,955
Great question.

192
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:22,697
It just depends on basically how big it winds up being.

193
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:27,118
We were looking at 40,000 square feet last year.

194
00:15:27,178 --> 00:15:32,640
And, you know, just depends on what company takes it, you know, could be 100, 200 people that work there.

195
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,662
Construction jobs could be very similar, although they're short term, as you know.

196
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:40,383
So we're looking at one to 200 short term jobs that pay a good wage.

197
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:46,911
And then one to 200 long-term jobs that also pay a good wage for people that work in this type of industry will be able to live in the community also.

198
00:15:47,171 --> 00:15:47,972
Yes, exactly.

199
00:15:48,892 --> 00:15:51,134
The biotech industry, as you know, has exploded.

200
00:15:51,154 --> 00:15:53,876
That's exactly what we're aiming for.

201
00:15:53,896 --> 00:16:00,782
And also, I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about how much money this would generate for the city in permitting fees and also increased tax revenues.

202
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,223
It's a great question.

203
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:06,887
I don't know the tax revenue one, but I think the project itself was in the

204
00:16:08,561 --> 00:16:17,468
$10 to $15 million range for the construction, shell and core construction, which I believe the permit fees now are $15 per 1,000.

205
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:23,692
Some quick math, it was probably $150,000 in permit fees potentially.

206
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:29,016
And then again, you do tenant fit ups and then you get to add more to that as time goes on.

207
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:33,439
But unfortunately, I'm an architect, not a tax guy.

208
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:42,239
Just last week, Mr. President, we had a neighbor of this parcel come to us with similar request.

209
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:51,183
They informed us that they'd be able to create a very similar aspect of jobs and growth growth was a little bit bigger is a lot larger parcel.

210
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:57,348
$3 million in permitting fees and $2.9 million in increased property tax revenues.

211
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:03,873
This project here, it should go pot and parcel with the approval that we just lended last week.

212
00:17:04,554 --> 00:17:07,176
If we're going to redevelop, let's redevelop the whole area at once.

213
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:12,360
We also see a project that's going to be taking place down at Walkman Court near the side of the train tracks.

214
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:17,124
So with some proper planning in the next 12 to 18 months, we could see

215
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:28,469
significant expanded tax base down to new jobs, as well as some revitalized curb appeal down in an area that's somewhat run down and blighted.

216
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,931
So this is something that I think is good for our community to support a lot of.

217
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,343
Thank you.

218
00:17:34,383 --> 00:17:42,028
Thank you, Mr President, and again thank you for coming here, you know, like, like, like mentioned, you know, brings jobs to the area and increase tax revenue.

219
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,210
Um, and like you said no mom Mr was here last week.

220
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,332
Is your group going to be working with his group so.

221
00:17:50,020 --> 00:18:00,615
We don't have two different type buildings or maybe we get up, maybe they can so they could kind of work in conjunction and make it make the aesthetically look a lot more pleasing with the two buildings are somewhat look alike.

222
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,097
Interesting, interesting.

223
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,041
I know John's stuff got to work.

224
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:06,522
They're two different parcels, right?

225
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:09,423
I don't know what Mr. Walsh's intentions are there.

226
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:24,210
We had presented a really contemporary addition on top of the, addition to the existing 200 bus in that building, which was a 1920s converted mattress factory, right?

227
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,872
And we were going to make it a very contemporary thing.

228
00:18:27,892 --> 00:18:32,274
We'd got through the community development board twice with the project and they really loved it.

229
00:18:33,014 --> 00:18:39,575
you know, bringing the curb appeal that you mentioned and some community amenities space down below.

230
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:42,876
Actually, I had spoken to Mr. Rafferty about it at one point in time.

231
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:47,436
So yes, there's, hopefully there's a synergy with it.

232
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:48,817
I don't know his schedule.

233
00:18:49,177 --> 00:18:54,338
Our schedule is kind of pushed back a little bit, because we didn't kind of get where we needed to be last year.

234
00:18:55,078 --> 00:18:58,398
But I would envision the same type of structure.

235
00:18:58,418 --> 00:19:00,179
Yeah, that'd be great.

236
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,419
And it keeps the curb appeal good.

237
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:12,943
You know, as we move forward, so you know, here we are, you know, we are, we've got two, two weeks and they have something that this council has worked on for a while and then we finally did it.

238
00:19:13,283 --> 00:19:25,570
But now, um, now we have, we need to step up because the process on housing for people, because I'm getting calls from people saying, you know, hey, we'd like to come here, but we're a little concerned about, you know, bringing employees here, where are they going to live?

239
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:35,691
So, you know, we've got housing projects on the table that I think need to be sped up to meet the demands of these new companies coming in.

240
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:37,312
You've got two here.

241
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:43,236
You've got that rise project on Mystic Valley Parkway, you know, is moving along.

242
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:45,377
You got a couple of other companies showing interest here.

243
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:52,622
So, if you want people to come to the community, a lot of them want to live in the community that they work in.

244
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:56,284
So I think, you know, we've got to step up that housing end of it.

245
00:19:56,771 --> 00:20:03,099
And again, when you bring people into the community, more businesses come to the community.

246
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:05,482
That's been a long thing.

247
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,084
I've been on many commissions here.

248
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:09,667
People talk about all the things that they want.

249
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,136
in the community, stores, you want this.

250
00:20:12,176 --> 00:20:15,657
Well, in order to get those things, you have to have people.

251
00:20:16,157 --> 00:20:17,738
Businesses wanna come where there's people.

252
00:20:18,438 --> 00:20:23,620
And once we start increasing our housing stock, you'll start to see more business come.

253
00:20:25,921 --> 00:20:28,622
Five years ago, there wasn't an open storefront in the city of Medford.

254
00:20:29,222 --> 00:20:31,803
Now they're all over the place.

255
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:35,064
And it's not anyone's fault, the pandemic had it, but it's doing better.

256
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,335
It's been three or four years now, and we really haven't done anything.

257
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:53,348
And I'm happy that we're finally starting to pick up the pace and catch up with the other cities, because all the other cities around us have developed, and we're the last batch in here.

258
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,512
And I don't want us to miss the wave that's going to come through.

259
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,868
So I'm glad I'm glad I'm happy you're here tonight.

260
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:01,930
And again, hopefully we'll see more coming down the line.

261
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:08,653
But we also need to start looking at our housing stock, the people that want to live in this community in work.

262
00:21:08,713 --> 00:21:10,474
Again, thank you for coming.

263
00:21:10,655 --> 00:21:11,395
Thank you for having me.

264
00:21:11,575 --> 00:21:11,855
Thank you.

265
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:17,020
Thank you, Vice President bears and thank you, Mr rainy for being here tonight.

266
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:33,637
I would definitely concur with everything counselor cardiologist said I hope that this could be the start of a really positive flywheeler feel feedback loop between bringing good jobs to our community, updating or using our updated zoning code to really

267
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:42,543
grease the wheels of that, and then following up with making sure that we have the developments needed to house all this positive new development and movement in our community.

268
00:21:42,923 --> 00:21:49,064
So if this is, I believe if our next move is to report this out to the Community Development Board, I would make a motion to do that.

269
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:52,645
And then I would look forward to hopefully approving it when it comes back our way.

270
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:54,665
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

271
00:21:54,705 --> 00:21:57,506
Yeah, you know, Chapter 48 rules here.

272
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,766
So we have to send this to Community Development Board and then they'll

273
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:04,854
take a look at it, and it sounds like they've taken a look at it before, so they may have some positive looks.

274
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:12,557
I do wanna recognize that we do have our Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt, as well as our Economic Development Director, Victor Schrader.

275
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,618
I don't know if either of you would like to say anything at this time.

276
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:17,619
Wave at me and I'll unmute you.

277
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:21,800
Seeing none.

278
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,281
Oh, okay, we got Alicia, all right.

279
00:22:25,061 --> 00:22:28,382
Alicia Hunt, just give us your name and address for the record, please.

280
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:30,524
Good evening, Mr. President.

281
00:22:32,246 --> 00:22:33,527
41 Watson Street in Medford.

282
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:51,482
I just wanted to let the council know and the public know that we have in fact been, our office, myself and Director Schrader have been meeting with the Cummings staff as well as the applicants from the previous week about these changes.

283
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:53,544
We think this is a good idea.

284
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:57,127
I've actually been discussing this with our comprehensive plan consultants

285
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:08,179
And we are looking forward to this we have tentatively scheduled a public hearing for July 14 with the CD board that does need to be duly noticed.

286
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:21,691
So that's why it's actually so long from right now is in order for us to meet the newspaper schedule, and we'll be working with the clerk to make sure the duly notice of the city council meeting that they all line up together.

287
00:23:23,227 --> 00:23:24,288
We are in favor of this.

288
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,171
If you would like to see a map, we have the map.

289
00:23:27,832 --> 00:23:33,458
Director Schrader has the map of this location, but I think you're all very familiar with what this location is.

290
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:37,502
And so I don't need to belabor the evening.

291
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:42,308
Just to confirm, are you saying that we can't refer this to Community Development Board tonight?

292
00:23:42,328 --> 00:23:44,771
No, no, you should refer it tonight.

293
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,974
The public hearing is of Community Development Board.

294
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:54,701
We are public hearing it will then for the process, the Community Development Board will issue a recommendation.

295
00:23:55,491 --> 00:24:02,314
and the city council will also hold a public hearing after that fact to review the recommendation and to vote on the matter.

296
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:12,057
So both of those, the city board, city, the community development board meeting and that city council meeting will need to be publicly noticed as public hearings.

297
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:13,798
Thank you, director.

298
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:16,719
I'm not usually in the hot seat here as I'm the vice president.

299
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:18,860
So I appreciate your direction.

300
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:22,701
Is there a motion to refer to Community Development Board?

301
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:27,023
On the motion of Councillor Collins to refer to the Community Development Board, seconded by Councillor Knight.

302
00:24:27,643 --> 00:24:28,304
All those in favour?

303
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:28,844
Aye.

304
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:30,045
We need a roll call.

305
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:31,946
All right, roll call.

306
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:33,727
Yes.

307
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:47,914
Yes, six in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

308
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:51,258
Councilor Collins.

309
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:56,664
While we're under suspension, motion to take paper 22400 followed by 22408.

310
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:00,948
All right, on the motion of Councilor Collins to take paper 22400 and 22408.

311
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:02,230
Seconded by, thank you.

312
00:25:06,033 --> 00:25:06,893
Seconded by Councilor Seng.

313
00:25:06,913 --> 00:25:07,534
All those in favor?

314
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:08,034
Aye.

315
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:08,714
Opposed?

316
00:25:09,215 --> 00:25:09,935
Motion passes.

317
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:12,416
22-400.

318
00:25:12,436 --> 00:25:18,479
To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, read.

319
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:20,080
Food truck permitting.

320
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:28,764
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, on behalf of the below entity, I respectfully submit to the City Council following requests for a food truck permit in the city of Medford.

321
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:33,607
In addition to City Council approval, vendors are required to adhere to health department food safety requirements.

322
00:25:34,547 --> 00:26:00,402

323
00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:10,549
Hi, my name is Matt love live at 27 Washington Avenue in Winthrop Massachusetts.

324
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,594
Currently, we have three different locations downtown Boston East Boston and Everett where we have our.

325
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:38,863
brick and mortar, and we are currently looking at more locations in downtown Boston in the Fenway area and in another location in East Boston and we are interested in doing some basic reconnaissance but also seeing if a place like ours would be welcomed and useful in this community.

326
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:42,465
We're a nonprofit that supports other local nonprofits.

327
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:54,993
Currently we're working with Soccer Without Borders as we bring more awareness of their organization and then also we do a portion of the proceeds that go to support that local nonprofit.

328
00:26:55,973 --> 00:27:05,179
We work with each nonprofit in the communities that we're involved in and we're just hoping that maybe Medford might be a location that we could possibly come to.

329
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:07,740
Mr. President?

330
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,761
Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

331
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:11,369
I appreciate the gentleman coming forward.

332
00:27:11,389 --> 00:27:19,435
I appreciate that some of the funding is going to nonprofits, and I appreciate that.

333
00:27:19,455 --> 00:27:32,925
But I think that my reservation to all the food trucks right now, especially with the pandemic just passing, is the commitment to a brick and mortar and what would happen with you taking a certain percentage away from a brick and mortar.

334
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:38,250
I think that's something that, before I make my vote, I'd like to hear more of the questions that are coming out.

335
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:57,179
I'm committed to our brick and mortar businesses that have committed to this community, especially during the most difficult times, and bringing an outside entity into a neighborhood that's going to directly compete with a brick and mortar, and their sustainability throughout this process and, and their bounce back, I think that

336
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:20,055
That's my hesitation with all the food truck industry and these pop up events because I think it, you know, if we look at neighboring neighboring coffee houses, and you take 20% of their business from seven to 11, it really is going to hurt their it's going to hurt their bottom line and their bottom line has a lot to do with the fees and

337
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,545
fees and permits requests and the limits that they have to live with while being a brick and mortar, as you well know.

338
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:47,841
So, you know, I'd like to, what y'all thought, as both a brick and mortar and a pop-up vendor, like, how would you, how would that impact your event if next door, a coffee establishment popped up a cart, maybe half a mile from your location?

339
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,162
Yeah, well,

340
00:28:50,338 --> 00:29:05,332
If half a mile away is quite a ways, and I don't think there's anything directly located near the Riverside Plaza where we're wanting to go totally understand that the desire for local, local businesses to be thriving.

341
00:29:05,773 --> 00:29:13,340
I don't know if what we would be as in competition would be something that would be even noticeable.

342
00:29:15,372 --> 00:29:17,414
that's yet to be seen until, how do we find out?

343
00:29:18,135 --> 00:29:28,385
We find out when Donuts of the Difference calls us and says, George, we have people just coming in buying donuts, but they're not buying their coffee because they're going to the coffee cart down the street.

344
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,287
So that's my reservation.

345
00:29:30,347 --> 00:29:32,209
So I appreciate your honesty.

346
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,011
I just wanted to be upfront and honest with you.

347
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:35,793
These are my reservations, so thank you.

348
00:29:37,886 --> 00:29:38,466
Thank you.

349
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:42,307
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for coming in.

350
00:29:42,607 --> 00:29:44,768
I'm wearing Riverside Plaza you're looking to go.

351
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:46,329
It's right on the corner.

352
00:29:46,849 --> 00:29:55,891
It's a large area that's what this is a pretty big plus, it's closer to trying to say to hear the main road that's right off the side.

353
00:29:57,032 --> 00:30:00,213
Salem Street or Salem Street, high street Salem Street.

354
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:08,057
I'm so right in the right in the square, you're looking at the correct.

355
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,624
So you got it, you got a donut shop street.

356
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:13,467
You have Mike's pastry.

357
00:30:18,403 --> 00:30:21,005
that I just think of my head, so.

358
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,247
In the Lighthouse Cafe, so.

359
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:35,155
I mean, that's, you know, as a responsible councilor here, I mean, to put a food truck up right across the street from a coffee and donut shop is kind of slapping their face.

360
00:30:35,995 --> 00:30:45,602
And there's no reflection on you, but I mean, how would you like it if, you know, if I opened up, you know, they were brick and mortar, they've been there,

361
00:30:46,142 --> 00:30:48,744
for as many years as I can remember.

362
00:30:49,645 --> 00:30:54,069
And now we're letting someone come in and non-brick and mortar go across streets.

363
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:57,552
Again, nothing to do with personally or your business.

364
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:03,657
I'm glad that your money goes to nonprofits, but you have to understand the position we're in.

365
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:08,802
And I think we need a little more information before we can,

366
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:15,410
make a decision on this, you know, exactly where the pause, you want to just go right in the repository with chairs and everything.

367
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,011
Yes.

368
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:28,840
I think our main hope is just to see if this I mean that's on city property that's city property I don't ever remember a business going on city property before, you know,

369
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:31,848
on a regular basis.

370
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:38,855
I mean, who's, who's going to cover the insurance on that insurance and you are the insurance of the city.

371
00:31:39,516 --> 00:31:41,258
I know we'll have to cover our own insurance.

372
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:50,187
But I don't, I don't, I can't remember the last time the city allowed a business to open up on city property.

373
00:31:50,947 --> 00:31:53,089
And maybe someone could enlighten me on that.

374
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:56,113
Councilor Campbell, we do have Mr. Schrader.

375
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,094
I don't know if he's involved with this at all.

376
00:31:58,254 --> 00:32:08,217
I don't know, I think if you could speak to this or not, but you are the economic development director, so.

377
00:32:10,977 --> 00:32:12,178
Yes, thank you, councilors.

378
00:32:12,218 --> 00:32:12,698
Good evening.

379
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:20,015
We did meet with, with the proponent and ask them some questions about their concept.

380
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:31,404
I think Councilor Scarpelli's comments are very relevant we certainly want to support our brick and mortar businesses as they're recovering from the pandemic.

381
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:50,828
It's a pretty limited run that they're asking for, and we do think there is more demand for coffee in the square than is being provided, but I think those are great comments and we should be thinking about our permanent brick and mortar businesses first.

382
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:57,730
And Councilor Caraviello, we could look into that a little further.

383
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:05,567
You know, for a food truck, they technically do park on the right of way.

384
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:12,772
But in terms of being in a park space like this, it's not uncommon.

385
00:33:13,532 --> 00:33:23,098
Folks are operating in DCR property or city-owned property from time to time.

386
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:24,159
We got a point of information.

387
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:29,176
I've been looking at the application that's before us versus the issue that we're discussing here.

388
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:30,358
We're talking about a food truck permit.

389
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:32,540
This isn't a food truck, this is a pushcart.

390
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,243
And the city of Memphis has an ordinance that prohibits pushcart services.

391
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:42,051
Right, so whether or not we're for it or against it or anything else.

392
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,982
This doesn't, this application isn't being presented to the council or the body in the right scope and form, right?

393
00:33:48,002 --> 00:33:52,526
So for us to vote on this as a food truck doesn't make sense because it's not a food truck, it's a pushcart.

394
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:55,228
We have an ordinance that governs pushcarts at this point in time.

395
00:33:55,588 --> 00:34:01,913
It might not be the answer that you want to see in terms of pushcarts are prohibited, I believe, in the city of Medford.

396
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:07,316
But from what I'm looking at here and what I see, I see a pushcart, not a food truck.

397
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:11,580
I don't see this application as being appropriate for the food truck,

398
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:13,846
application process.

399
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:21,289
Listen, if you were here and you said I want a one day permit to go to go to circle in the square, which was a big event that we had last week, I want to say go for it.

400
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,070
You know, I share my council's concerns.

401
00:34:23,851 --> 00:34:25,251
But I think that there is a solution.

402
00:34:26,052 --> 00:34:31,255
And when we look at the draft food truck ordinance that this city hasn't been able to put their head around since 2016.

403
00:34:31,715 --> 00:34:36,697
Now, something that I support, I think that the city should have the opportunity to bring food trucks and other opportunities.

404
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:40,019
And I think competition, you know, is good for business, it drives costs down.

405
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,860
So it's always a good thing for the consumer.

406
00:34:42,351 --> 00:34:44,652
It also creates better product for the consumer, right?

407
00:34:44,692 --> 00:34:46,133
So it's price control and better product.

408
00:34:46,193 --> 00:34:47,053
It's great for the neighborhood.

409
00:34:47,073 --> 00:34:48,374
It's great for the economy, right?

410
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:48,934
Don't get me wrong.

411
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:49,995
I think a food truck will be good.

412
00:34:50,595 --> 00:35:02,361
A food truck draft ordinance that we had that's been kicking around now for half a decade, has in it a contingency that says that the permit will be offered only if all businesses within 200 feet sign off on it.

413
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:09,285
If Maryland, as well as for the difference, doesn't care, then John,

414
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,433
That Martin Pastry doesn't care.

415
00:35:11,634 --> 00:35:14,477
And they say, yeah, we have no problem with it.

416
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:16,118
Then why would we?

417
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,280
Right?

418
00:35:18,387 --> 00:35:20,488
It's an opportunity to bring something new to the community.

419
00:35:20,568 --> 00:35:25,369
It's an opportunity for us to try something different, to liven up a dead space, right?

420
00:35:25,809 --> 00:35:29,090
I know we have the chess club down there whenever they're down there in the summertime as well.

421
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:36,193
I know that we've invested a lot of money in this area down here to bring people to the square under prior administrations, and that focus is somewhat soft.

422
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,253
So I don't think it's a bad idea.

423
00:35:38,273 --> 00:35:39,054
I don't at all.

424
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:46,596
I share the concerns that my colleagues reiterated, have mentioned, and I also don't feel as though this is falling into the right process.

425
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:52,459
but it's something that I think we could come up with a solution on and maybe Vic, I don't know what you think about that.

426
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:54,880
Mr. Schrader.

427
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,281
That was a wicked long point of information.

428
00:35:57,301 --> 00:36:01,043
I apologize for that.

429
00:36:01,464 --> 00:36:03,465
Councilor Knight, I was just looking through the ordinance.

430
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:04,986
Are you referring to the peddlers?

431
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:06,186
Yes.

432
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:06,867
Okay.

433
00:36:08,748 --> 00:36:09,748
We did take a look at that.

434
00:36:09,788 --> 00:36:12,930
We didn't think it applied to food, but we can certainly look at that again.

435
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,981
I apologize if this isn't being classified properly.

436
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:25,804
And yeah, I think also the point was also that we should look comprehensively at the, at all of these or at the food truck.

437
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:32,087
I mean, I guess in the food truck ordinance, the way it was presented today, just like I did when it was presented before.

438
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:42,851
But I agree with council, Mr. Schrader, if you talk to neighboring, if this, if there isn't an issue with the push cap, if that, if the neighboring businesses,

439
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:52,705
allow the 21 to 24 days, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, you know, I would recommend that maybe we table this until they petition those other businesses.

440
00:36:52,765 --> 00:36:56,389
And if those other businesses approve, I would gladly vote for them.

441
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:01,253
You know, if it's, again, it's only for, I believe it's 21 to 24 days.

442
00:37:01,273 --> 00:37:02,735
The term's already over pretty much.

443
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:03,375
All right.

444
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:08,981
So, I mean, if they did that and they come back and said, to see if we can bring another brick and mortar business,

445
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:20,227
I like the concept because it's a, because what the petition is asking for is a trial to bring in, uh, hopefully a full-time brick and mortar.

446
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:21,287
Am I correct with that?

447
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:22,108
Correct.

448
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:22,308
Right.

449
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:24,509
So I, I agree with Councilor Knight.

450
00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:37,758
I think that maybe if we can table this, ask, um, ask our, uh, city administration to reach out to the neighboring, I believe there's four locations that, that directly affect, uh,

451
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:40,384
know, that timeline.

452
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:43,325
I don't, I don't think they'll agree with you.

453
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,406
I don't think they'll disagree with me.

454
00:37:44,506 --> 00:37:46,407
I just think that we need that.

455
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:52,590
We've been pretty stuck, at least I've been, I've been pretty strict on my decisions and I don't want to

456
00:37:53,600 --> 00:38:00,546
and throw anybody away, I say, I don't, I'm not interested, especially with some of the, you know, the downtown empty businesses.

457
00:38:00,606 --> 00:38:01,827
I would love to see another business.

458
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:06,351
If we can do that, I appreciate council and I bringing that open mind.

459
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:10,055
It's also important to put a mystic coffee roaster was there and then no longer there anymore.

460
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:11,156
No providing a service.

461
00:38:11,576 --> 00:38:11,876
Thank you.

462
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:12,677
Councilor Scarpelli.

463
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:13,378
Councilor Collins.

464
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:16,915
Thank you very much for being before us today.

465
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:30,079
As a small business owner myself who's done pop ups I, you know, I respect you for what you're doing I appreciate the spirit of reconnaissance to see if a brick and mortar community is kind of the space that you'd want to grow roots and.

466
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,721
I'm interested by the potential issue just with the permit that's before us.

467
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,702
Obviously, if it's not appropriate, there's something to figure out there.

468
00:38:39,742 --> 00:38:43,423
That's something that I think procedurally we should run down.

469
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:50,584
But in terms of next steps, as was stated, if we table this for one week, we're in July.

470
00:38:50,624 --> 00:39:01,167
And then if we're thinking about Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, that windows it down to 12 or 13 days that are potentially when you'd be overlapping with hours of service at other brick and mortars locally.

471
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:13,514
My inclination would be if we get the procedural kinks worked out, you know, I'd love to see you pop up, especially since you have a demonstrated interest in seeing this as a community that you could grow roots in.

472
00:39:13,534 --> 00:39:14,294
I think that'd be great.

473
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:15,635
You know, I like that you're a nonprofit.

474
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:16,636
It sounds great on paper.

475
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:23,880
I guess I'm curious to hear from my fellow counselors procedurally, what's the next step?

476
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,183
If it's really limited to less than, you know, two weeks of business days,

477
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:46,903
how we can go forward from here to give you your shot at sussing out if downtown Medford is a place that you can, that you can grow in and to make sure that we're, you know, giving our, giving credence to the, the shops that are already, already in Medford square.

478
00:39:48,443 --> 00:39:48,744
Thank you.

479
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:49,704
Thank you, Mr. President.

480
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,904
Again, if Victor can just,

481
00:39:54,295 --> 00:40:13,934
identify whether what what he falls into is cause failure because we've turned down hot dog cots and other things that wanted to pop up on different areas of the city and they've been turned down in the past so you know we have to figure out you know what he falls into is he is he a peddler or

482
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:24,138
What he falls into, is he a food truck or is he a push cart?

483
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:29,263
I think that's really the issue that we have to figure out.

484
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:35,608
Because we have turned down hot dog people and people wanted to do sandwiches and they wanted to park in different private areas.

485
00:40:35,628 --> 00:40:37,130
They've been turned down in the past.

486
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,693
Just want to make sure that we do it right.

487
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:45,961
and I'm sure Victor and his staff can figure it out within a week or so.

488
00:40:46,321 --> 00:40:47,441
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

489
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:52,264
And I just want to say, as you can tell by the terminology we're using, some of our ordinances are a little old.

490
00:40:54,285 --> 00:41:09,554
And I think the intent of this council certainly, or at least myself as a councilor, it sounds like the intent of the council is that we'd like to, in the long run, modernize our ordinances because we want to create on-ramps for businesses like yours to test it out.

491
00:41:09,574 --> 00:41:10,695
I mean, I think it'd be,

492
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:16,052
Wouldn't it be great to have another coffee house instead of another bank and another insurance company?

493
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:19,658
No offense to our wonderful banks and insurance companies, but we have quite a few of them in Bedford Square.

494
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:20,259
And it's not a lot of.

495
00:41:22,902 --> 00:41:24,183
not a lot of foot traffic.

496
00:41:24,904 --> 00:41:29,969
So, you know, I just, I just want to make that point, you know, we're doing a little bit of a procedural thing.

497
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:42,581
It sounded like there was a motion to table this maybe for one week and ask Victor Schrader to review, to make sure that this is allowed under the push carts, as well as to reach out to the neighboring businesses that may be affected.

498
00:41:42,641 --> 00:41:42,821
Right.

499
00:41:43,622 --> 00:41:46,665
Letting them know it's only 21 to 24 days, probably less now, but.

500
00:41:47,403 --> 00:41:48,964
You know, I really want to support this.

501
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:51,485
So I think that, but again, we have to be fair.

502
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:54,606
Again, this is where we don't have legal representation to help us.

503
00:41:54,926 --> 00:42:01,868
And I don't want us to be in a point where we agree for something that it goes back to say, past practice, we've done this and then it hurts us.

504
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:03,449
So I apologize.

505
00:42:03,469 --> 00:42:04,890
Procedural has nothing to do with you.

506
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,651
Unfortunately, we're a bit of a mess when it comes to legal representation when it comes to our council.

507
00:42:09,671 --> 00:42:11,392
So it's kind of a little trouble.

508
00:42:11,812 --> 00:42:12,092
Thank you.

509
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:12,973
I'm going to go to council.

510
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:13,953
I think Mr. Schrader.

511
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,394
When did you submit your application?

512
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:18,274
When did you submit your application?

513
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:19,756
How long was the application process?

514
00:42:20,196 --> 00:42:22,979
I think I started it at the beginning of this month.

515
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:23,460
This month?

516
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,922
Okay, so it was a relatively quick turnaround.

517
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,203
I think it was the night of the second.

518
00:42:26,223 --> 00:42:28,205
It was the day I finalized everything.

519
00:42:30,302 --> 00:42:31,283
You know, welcome to Medford, right?

520
00:42:31,303 --> 00:42:32,403
You know, we don't want to give a bad taste.

521
00:42:32,423 --> 00:42:34,144
We don't want to put on a bad taste anymore.

522
00:42:34,164 --> 00:42:36,285
We're glad that you want to invest in our community, right?

523
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:38,847
And I don't think it sounds like that somewhat, you know what I mean?

524
00:42:38,947 --> 00:42:40,207
It could be Boston.

525
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:43,329
Boston's worse though, trust me.

526
00:42:43,489 --> 00:42:48,352
So, you know, obviously this is something I think that, you know, we've gotten a commitment from the majority of this body.

527
00:42:48,392 --> 00:42:52,094
It's something we want to work out, even if we create a pilot program and do something like that.

528
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,155
I'll gladly be the pilot program.

529
00:42:54,215 --> 00:42:54,515
Right.

530
00:42:54,635 --> 00:42:55,076
Exactly.

531
00:42:55,136 --> 00:42:55,296
Right.

532
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:59,037
You know, I think that's just something that maybe we can put a little bit of green.

533
00:42:59,057 --> 00:42:59,437
Just a week.

534
00:42:59,497 --> 00:43:02,638
I mean, if we could just, if Victor can do that, I mean, he's ready.

535
00:43:02,758 --> 00:43:09,020
Victor, if you let us know if that's possible, we'll look at this over the next week and we can make it to the next week.

536
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,601
Absolutely.

537
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:10,341
We'll jump right on it.

538
00:43:12,321 --> 00:43:12,642
Thank you.

539
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:17,123
Yeah, and I think it was the question around the push carts as well as the neighboring businesses that may be affected.

540
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:18,523
So thank you, Mr. Treanor.

541
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:22,705
You have a question?

542
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:23,305
You can ask it.

543
00:43:24,595 --> 00:43:24,855
Thanks.

544
00:43:25,256 --> 00:43:33,282
I was just going to ask the proponent if you're planning on moving the cart from place to place or being stationary in one, one location.

545
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:53,957
I think just the target area when we looked around what would be the ideal spot I think that was just to get a general idea of what the community is looking at that's a focal areas spot where people come to the chest area chest area, it just seems like a nice area for getting a feel for what the community likes.

546
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:55,642
It's stationary.

547
00:43:55,882 --> 00:43:56,943
Yes, it is stationary.

548
00:43:57,223 --> 00:44:00,365
I have to have wheels on it for Boston, but it's stationary.

549
00:44:01,006 --> 00:44:05,689
There's a lot of things for Boston I gotta do.

550
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:13,775
As I look at this, I know a place right across the street where you're gonna go, they're closed Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

551
00:44:14,355 --> 00:44:16,977
They're not open because they felt that business is bad.

552
00:44:17,578 --> 00:44:22,782
But would you think of maybe changing your hours

553
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:47,184
on to maybe later in the day when there's actually people in the square I mean, no disrespect to you, maybe you know you know you've been but I don't I don't know how many people in the square at seven o'clock in the morning, you know, they're gonna walk, you know, again, not much traffic but I think you know if you've maybe tried it on maybe a couple of weekends, maybe, you know, 12 before maybe or maybe.

554
00:44:47,204 --> 00:44:48,645
No, that sounds great.

555
00:44:48,685 --> 00:44:51,547
We're already the two locations downtown

556
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:57,867
we're going from, we were at seven to noon and now we're going from 10 to four.

557
00:44:58,347 --> 00:45:04,370
So yeah, it's, it is, it's kind of a, that's the whole idea of just kind of like get a feel of what it's like.

558
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,691
There's not a lot of foot traffic in Memphis Square between seven and 11.

559
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:17,916
Maybe if you look in your, you know, maybe you want to change the days, maybe you do, you know, Friday, maybe Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or maybe, you know, there's a, and maybe a little later in the afternoon when you get that afternoon crowd.

560
00:45:18,517 --> 00:45:19,177
Will you show up?

561
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:22,830
Ricky doesn't like to go to car shows.

562
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,371
He doesn't like to go to car shows.

563
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:28,273
As you notice, I haven't missed many meals in my life.

564
00:45:28,293 --> 00:45:35,397
But no, because maybe, you know, as a business person, I don't see that seven o'clock crowd in the square.

565
00:45:36,357 --> 00:45:41,399
Whereas, you know, there's more people in the afternoon that utilize that plaza.

566
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,642
Maybe you want to do it on the weekend, you know.

567
00:45:45,762 --> 00:45:48,023
It's your business, do what you want, but, you know.

568
00:45:49,191 --> 00:45:50,412
Drive around Memphis Square on a Monday evening.

569
00:45:50,432 --> 00:45:51,212
Maybe it's Wright's Pond.

570
00:45:51,433 --> 00:45:52,333
Thank you.

571
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:54,875
Wright's Pond, I mean, you're killing it.

572
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:59,678
If I may, maybe just your hours.

573
00:46:00,278 --> 00:46:05,062
For your own business practice and see how many people that are there, maybe from 11 to two.

574
00:46:05,502 --> 00:46:06,182
Thank you.

575
00:46:06,242 --> 00:46:07,383
Versus seven to 11.

576
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:08,864
Thanks, Councilor Caraballo.

577
00:46:09,004 --> 00:46:09,625
It sounds like.

578
00:46:10,285 --> 00:46:12,227
Mr Schrader is more than amenable to look at this.

579
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:28,944
He wants a job, move it forward and maybe maybe potentially some amendments if necessary so sounds like that communication is going to happen so I hearing on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli to table for one week pending some review by our, our friends, or do you want to speak to us because I'm sorry.

580
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:34,195
Oh, you're seconding on that motion Councilor Scott planning table for one week seconded by Councilor Collins all those in favor.

581
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:34,696
All right.

582
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:35,276
Opposed.

583
00:46:35,897 --> 00:46:36,798
Motion passes.

584
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:37,878
Thank you.

585
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:41,461
We wouldn't make the gentleman come back next week.

586
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:43,903
No, you zoom in right you can zoom in next week.

587
00:46:43,923 --> 00:46:44,964
You don't have to come back.

588
00:46:45,004 --> 00:46:46,205
If we can well under suspension.

589
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,543
We did have Councilor Collins motion to take communications from the mayor.

590
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:55,704
So we have one more paper.

591
00:46:56,325 --> 00:46:56,665
Thank you.

592
00:46:56,845 --> 00:46:59,227
So we have a paper 22 dash 408.

593
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:13,881
June 15 2022 to the Honorable President members of the Metro City Council City Hall and for Massachusetts to 155 fiscal year 2023 budget submission here President morale and members of the City Council pursuant to mass general chapter 44 section 32.

594
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:20,064
I respectfully request and recommend the city council approve the proposed fiscal year 2023 budget as submitted.

595
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:28,133
The total submitted appropriation for all departments, including schools is, and this number has actually changed over the weekend, so let me get the right one in front of me, is $201,154,843.02.

596
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:56,077
Account details will be included within the budget presentation which will be available electronically on June 21 2022, and an interactive and searchable format by the city's website at Medford ma.org slash mayor slash city budget would folks like me to read, Mr. President, I would like to request a copy budget book, as we've received in the previous technically not done reading could someone move to waive the reading.

597
00:47:57,278 --> 00:47:58,118
Motion to waive the reading.

598
00:47:58,298 --> 00:48:00,659
That's just the reading of the salaries and expenses.

599
00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:02,700
We can do this in the future.

600
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,123
So moving on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Schiapoli to waive the reading.

601
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:07,743
All those in favor?

602
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:08,843
All those opposed?

603
00:48:08,863 --> 00:48:09,684
The motion passes.

604
00:48:09,704 --> 00:48:12,385
I'm gonna go to Councilor Collins and then Councilor Knight.

605
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,326
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

606
00:48:16,467 --> 00:48:21,450
The full electronic copy of the budget may be online right now.

607
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:23,851
When I left my house at 4.30, it was not.

608
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:25,452
I haven't had a chance to review the budget.

609
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:32,856
you know, goes without saying, I respect the state deadline for issuing this budget to us, but I haven't had a chance to look at it.

610
00:48:33,056 --> 00:48:34,437
And so I don't feel comfortable voting on it.

611
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:35,738
So I'd motion to table for one week.

612
00:48:36,258 --> 00:48:36,518
Okay.

613
00:48:36,718 --> 00:48:51,187
Um, just if, if I may, just before there's a second on that motion, Councilor Knight, you would request you're requesting something before we have Councilor Knight has moved to request that we get a hard copy of the fiscal year 2023 budget book for the city of Medford seconded by

614
00:48:52,395 --> 00:48:53,935
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

615
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:54,696
All those in favor?

616
00:48:55,256 --> 00:48:55,656
Opposed?

617
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:56,656
Motion passes.

618
00:48:57,456 --> 00:49:07,999
On the motion of Councilor Collins to table for one week due to that we have not completed all of our budget hearings, have not had time to review a complete budget book and a myriad of other issues.

619
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:10,939
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

620
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,680
All those in favor on the motion to table for one week?

621
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,100
Opposed?

622
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,361
Motion passes.

623
00:49:19,521 --> 00:49:21,802
If I may actually, Councilor Kerrio, could you take over for me for a minute?

624
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:50,628
Scott belly.

625
00:49:51,168 --> 00:50:01,952
She was here for public participation but it's paper to dash x x x, if we can, if she can come up and it's a public.

626
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,783
We can't take action, right?

627
00:50:05,823 --> 00:50:06,724
She can speak, correct.

628
00:50:09,926 --> 00:50:14,810
Yeah, if you'd like to come up and speak, that'd be fine.

629
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:20,935
So just so you understand what it is, we can hear you because where it falls is unfinished business.

630
00:50:21,475 --> 00:50:28,140
We can hear the situation, but we can't rule on anything, just so you know that, publicly.

631
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:29,330
That's fine.

632
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:29,851
Okay, thank you.

633
00:50:30,131 --> 00:50:30,371
Thank you.

634
00:50:30,411 --> 00:50:31,452
Name and address of the record, please.

635
00:50:31,472 --> 00:50:32,753
My name is Erica Schatz.

636
00:50:32,833 --> 00:50:36,376
My address is 5 Cabot Road, apartment 127 Medford.

637
00:50:36,976 --> 00:50:40,619
I'm actually here about my mom's address, which is 101 Sydney Street.

638
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:54,088
I've been elusively trying to get an appointment with the mayor because I was guaranteed my sidewalks would be finished in October by DPW engineering and the tree warden, and they're not finished.

639
00:50:54,149 --> 00:50:55,129
They never even started.

640
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,311
And now they're trying to say,

641
00:50:58,162 --> 00:51:03,084
It's because of the trees, but my sidewalk's not lifting because of the trees.

642
00:51:03,304 --> 00:51:05,785
There's actually no drainage in the circle.

643
00:51:06,745 --> 00:51:13,967
And when I showed these lovely photos to the head engineer, he said that the sidewalk is not sinking.

644
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:19,569
A truck parked on my curb and made my curb flush with the street.

645
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:24,351
My mom, who is disabled, has fallen and

646
00:51:25,904 --> 00:51:30,685
She chose not to sue the city because they'd say, well, it's your sidewalk, you should know it's messed up.

647
00:51:31,865 --> 00:51:39,187
And other people have fallen, but because it's not a high traffic area, apparently we're very low on the list.

648
00:51:42,087 --> 00:51:47,549
And Mike Marks was helping me prior to January.

649
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:50,529
And that's when they said, oh, they'll be done in October.

650
00:51:50,929 --> 00:51:54,190
And October came and went and no sidewalks.

651
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:57,414
We apologize for the oversight.

652
00:51:58,234 --> 00:52:02,555
Again, if we could take a look, pictures are coming around, we can take a look.

653
00:52:02,675 --> 00:52:09,118
One of my sidewalks, the slab is lifted literally four inches from the rest of the sidewalk.

654
00:52:09,718 --> 00:52:10,638
Counselor, did you want to speak?

655
00:52:11,658 --> 00:52:12,639
I just had a question.

656
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:14,579
I was wondering if the street was a private way.

657
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,540
It is not.

658
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:16,700
It is not, okay.

659
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,521
It's a cul-de-sac, but it's not a private way.

660
00:52:18,641 --> 00:52:20,521
That's important.

661
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,202
But apparently it's a low traffic.

662
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:25,283
They put you on the list and they'd be on the list forever because they don't do private ways.

663
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:29,142
If it was a private way, I would have done it myself.

664
00:52:29,162 --> 00:52:33,307
Because I'm at the point where I'm ready to do it myself.

665
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:37,814
And then they tried saying that they could only do asphalt.

666
00:52:37,834 --> 00:52:41,599
What was that address again?

667
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:42,260
101 Sydney Street.

668
00:52:48,861 --> 00:52:58,829
Correct, but because of the lack of drainage, the curbing is sinking and the sidewalk is sinking and it's affecting the entire circle.

669
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,812
I measured every curb and none of them are the standard six inches.

670
00:53:05,374 --> 00:53:06,815
It's about an inch off the street now.

671
00:53:09,937 --> 00:53:14,881
Because the nearest drain is about three houses away from the cul-de-sac.

672
00:53:16,282 --> 00:53:17,863
That's my mom's injuries, yes.

673
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:32,332
Maybe the chief of staffs on the call and she can ask us you can help set up an appointment with trying to get an appointment.

674
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:36,913
Mr. President is the chief of staff on the call still, Madam Chief of Staff, are you still on the call.

675
00:53:55,998 --> 00:53:57,799
I moved to take the budget off the table.

676
00:53:57,819 --> 00:53:58,900
How fast do you think she'll come back?

677
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,180
Yeah.

678
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:02,662
Um, I apologize that there's nobody here.

679
00:54:02,682 --> 00:54:09,806
Um, to answer the question, I said, I don't see the chief of staff here, uh, looking at the computer.

680
00:54:11,127 --> 00:54:14,329
Um, then maybe give you some, a little bit of help here.

681
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:24,315
Mr. President, Mr. President, if we can just have the petitioner, if she can reach out to the, um, Clark, maybe

682
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:29,051
put on next week's agenda so we can lead her to make sure the engineers here also.

683
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:32,371
You don't have to be here in person if you're we saw the pitches.

684
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:36,472
If you want to come and call in from zoom.

685
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:38,752
We can do that.

686
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:42,693
Okay.

687
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:47,174
It's a suggestion of the clerk that one of the council members put it on the agenda for next week.

688
00:54:47,694 --> 00:54:48,334
Okay, we'll do that.

689
00:54:48,394 --> 00:54:49,994
And this way and then we can vote on next week.

690
00:54:50,355 --> 00:54:52,695
And whoever puts it on the agenda, please

691
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:58,117
Please put down, please invite the city engineer and some of the VW maybe to attend.

692
00:54:58,137 --> 00:54:59,999
Okay, I mean she wants a meeting with the mayor.

693
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:08,268
I tried going to the mayor first because that's the proper channels but we can't facilitate a meeting with the mayor we've now, I can't, I can't get through to anybody.

694
00:55:08,288 --> 00:55:09,048
We'll ask everybody.

695
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:13,813
We have a chief of staff is supposed to be responsible for this stuff because I don't know what else they do.

696
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:14,094
Right.

697
00:55:14,114 --> 00:55:16,496
So this is something that the chief of staff should handle it.

698
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:23,972
All right, we have a chief of people or whatever, we have an HR director to handle HR, we have a budget director to handle the budget, we have a chief of staff that handles what?

699
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:24,212
Us.

700
00:55:24,873 --> 00:55:33,817
We also have, you know, we can have, that's an issue of handicapped accessibility, if we're saying that a resident is legally handicapped.

701
00:55:34,137 --> 00:55:34,637
She's disabled.

702
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:38,639
Disabled, excuse me, and we have an issue in front of their residence.

703
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:44,162
This is something that we can, we'll make a resolution and we'll bring it forth next week with inviting all the parties.

704
00:55:45,223 --> 00:55:45,463
Thank you.

705
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:48,498
Thank you.

706
00:55:49,518 --> 00:55:56,701
So we will have that on our agenda for next week and we will invite, who are we inviting, sorry?

707
00:55:56,761 --> 00:55:57,021
Nothing.

708
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:57,981
Okay, all right.

709
00:55:59,121 --> 00:55:59,441
Thank you.

710
00:56:04,123 --> 00:56:05,123
Is there a motion on the floor?

711
00:56:05,703 --> 00:56:06,584
Regular order of business?

712
00:56:07,224 --> 00:56:09,404
Oh no, regular order of business perhaps?

This gentleman served in World War II.

760
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:37,586
And there's not many World War II veterans left in this community.

761
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:42,789
And his passing is a loss to us again.

762
00:58:42,849 --> 00:58:44,830
And my condolences go out to the family.

763
00:58:46,186 --> 00:58:47,588
Thank you.

764
00:58:47,828 --> 00:59:08,426
Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you to my colleagues for putting this on Mr Fitzpatrick was a great guy had the opportunity to meet him on a couple of occasions at the American Legion through various community events that are going on with his sons Sean and Brian will both close friends, both following their father's footsteps, with a commitment to service with a commitment to the veterans in this community, and they've given a lot.

765
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:19,593
instrumental in decorating graves on Memorial Day and the like, really just great great individuals that give back to the city that there is.

766
00:59:19,713 --> 00:59:23,696
Fitzgerald's a great people, Fitzpatrick's a great people, and Mr. Fitzpatrick's gonna be sadly missed.

767
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:25,016
I offer my condolences as well.

768
00:59:25,397 --> 00:59:26,337
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

769
00:59:27,578 --> 00:59:31,460
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Caravaglia, seconded by Councilor Knight.

770
00:59:32,621 --> 00:59:33,962
All those in favor?

771
00:59:34,242 --> 00:59:34,742
Aye.

772
00:59:35,563 --> 00:59:36,403
All those opposed?

773
00:59:36,443 --> 00:59:37,024
Motion passes.

774
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:38,605
If we could all rise for a moment of silence.

775
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:55,366
Thank you.

776
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:15,367
motions orders and resolutions 22 dash 389 offered by Councilor night, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council requested the Board of Health establish a tick remediation program within the city of Medford Councilor night.

777
01:00:15,847 --> 01:00:25,070
Yes, Mr. President, if any of us have watched the news we've seen that it's going to be a bad season this year for ticks and the city of Medford is very blessed to have a great deal of open space.

778
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:32,072
The Middlesex fellows the Medford woods, and 22 active and passive parks across our community.

779
01:00:32,808 --> 01:00:36,870
But with that comes the concern that we will be breeding ground for ticks.

780
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:47,415
So I'm asking that the Board of Health put together a mediation program, report back to the council what the cost would be, and whether or not this is something we can work on funding so that we can keep our community safe from a public health standpoint.

781
01:00:48,435 --> 01:00:49,296
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

782
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:50,356
Any further discussion?

783
01:00:52,397 --> 01:00:56,419
Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Knight, to approve, seconded by Councilor Collins.

784
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:57,159
All those in favor?

785
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:57,560
Aye.

786
01:00:58,220 --> 01:00:58,740
Opposed?

787
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:00,241
Motion passes.

788
01:01:00,877 --> 01:01:03,078
22-390, Councilor Collins.

789
01:01:03,158 --> 01:01:04,079
I'd like to withdraw the motion.

790
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:10,322
Councilor Collins has withdrawn 22-390.

791
01:01:10,342 --> 01:01:19,187
22-391, offered by Councilor Caravaglio, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council requests an independent outside audit of the City of Medford's Municipal Departments and Medford Public Schools.

792
01:01:19,227 --> 01:01:20,068
Councilor Caravaglio.

793
01:01:20,108 --> 01:01:21,589
Thank you, Mr. President.

794
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:26,251
Seeing that we're in these difficult financial times,

795
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:34,208
I know the city does an audit, but in the past, I remember getting a copy of the audit.

796
01:01:36,187 --> 01:01:38,908
and meeting with bond council about where we stand.

797
01:01:39,168 --> 01:01:51,273
I can't remember, it's been probably three years, maybe longer since we actually sat with bond council and met to give us our financial status and met with the auditors to tell us where we're at.

798
01:01:51,293 --> 01:02:02,738
So I don't know if the city has done an audit, how recently, because I certainly haven't seen a copy of it and I don't know, maybe someone else has and I don't know about it, but I would request that.

799
01:02:04,215 --> 01:02:11,036
that won't be done for both school and the municipal side and report back to us.

800
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:22,078
And that we also have the opportunity to meet with bond council like we have in the future to let us know where our indebtedness is and where we stand with future bonding capability.

801
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:23,639
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

802
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:24,139
Councilor Knight.

803
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:25,339
Yes, Mr. President.

804
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:29,280
I know by mechanism of law, I do believe we're audited every year, but we've been using the same firm, I think,

805
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:31,029
two decades.

806
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:34,272
So at some point it becomes negligible, right?

807
01:02:34,312 --> 01:02:37,335
They're not going to say that they found something that they missed something last time.

808
01:02:38,279 --> 01:02:40,261
they're going to figure it out as they go forward.

809
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:56,993
So I think that it might be something we also want to see go out to bed or be sent through the inspector general's office or maybe through the DKM list of auditors that might be available and open to us so that we can pick them from a state approved list of contractors as opposed to having to put the matter out to bed or to seek private counsel.

810
01:02:57,013 --> 01:03:01,497
But I think it's very important that if we do have this audit, that it's done in an open and transparent fashion.

811
01:03:01,517 --> 01:03:06,441
And then the administration does conduct informational meetings throughout the process as well.

812
01:03:07,181 --> 01:03:10,782
Ultimately, the biggest topic in this community right now is on municipal finances.

813
01:03:12,282 --> 01:03:20,764
After a little bit of yelling and screaming, the council was able to create enough noise where we found $4 million over in the administration side of things, they found $4 million.

814
01:03:21,744 --> 01:03:35,527
So, you know, I think that as it goes forward, we wouldn't be in the situation we're in right now, not from a financial standpoint, but from a communication standpoint, if the administration stepped up to the plate and shared with us the information that we asked for and shared with us the information that we needed.

815
01:03:36,133 --> 01:03:36,433
All right.

816
01:03:36,553 --> 01:03:44,800
And now as we sit here and we see the circumstances unfold, it gives us a reason to scratch our heads and raise question.

817
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:47,743
Um, so this is a vote that I'm happy to take this evening.

818
01:03:48,243 --> 01:03:50,385
Um, you know, I hope that we're doing things the right way.

819
01:03:50,405 --> 01:03:55,689
I hope that we're not mismanaging our money financially, but right now, you know, track record shows that we are.

820
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,752
Um, so I think this is a responsible resolution.

821
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:00,493
I think it's a responsible course of action.

822
01:04:01,093 --> 01:04:02,935
Um, the question is going to lie in who's going to conduct

823
01:04:03,335 --> 01:04:09,217
the audit, and whether or not it's going to be the same group that's been doing it year in and year out or if we're going to go and have some new fresh eyes.

824
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:12,619
Thank you.

825
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:13,279
Yes.

826
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:19,021
I didn't put it in there but if you can amend that to the administration has set up a meeting with our bond council.

827
01:04:19,941 --> 01:04:20,402
So we can.

828
01:04:21,302 --> 01:04:26,644
So they can give us an update where we stand with our bond rating and future borrowing capability.

829
01:04:30,165 --> 01:04:31,746
Yes, so we have had in the past but I

830
01:04:32,188 --> 01:04:34,309
I don't think we've had one in a few years.

831
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:36,249
Thank you.

832
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,470
Any further discussion from members of the council.

833
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:47,313
If I may, from the chair, I just like to add to this, that, you know, it seems like by the end of the year.

834
01:04:48,098 --> 01:04:50,861
When we have to go to the state and certify everything, we get everything together.

835
01:04:51,502 --> 01:04:54,947
But it seems like potentially is up to as much as the other 11 months of the year.

836
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:56,388
It's hard to find out what's going on.

837
01:04:56,408 --> 01:05:02,536
I think one of the reasons that we found that out is because we have all these different financial software that doesn't talk to each other.

838
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:10,316
You know, nevermind the fact that you know that was a problem before then we didn't have, you know, staff around for 10 months there.

839
01:05:10,336 --> 01:05:13,879
And, and I just want to add one more thing before you go counselor night.

840
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:17,641
I was looking at the capital improvement plan that's proposed in 2021.

841
01:05:19,212 --> 01:05:24,335
And it didn't plan to address the issue with financial software until at least fiscal year 2024.

842
01:05:24,875 --> 01:05:26,957
And that was assuming we had money to do it.

843
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:39,744
So, you know, if we had addressed that two years ago, then we wouldn't have been in the position of not having the information that we need at the time that we needed to make the decisions that the community entrusts us to make and have the information that the community wants.

844
01:05:41,725 --> 01:06:05,076
I'm not amending this resolution, but I just want to add to the point that if we were prioritizing this issue, as the council has filed many, councilors have filed many motions, the council has approved, this is another one in a list of financial responsibility measures, for lack of a better term, that we may have more information at a more timely way and would have been able to see what's happened over the last three weeks coming.

845
01:06:05,516 --> 01:06:07,457
So with that, I'll go to councilor Knight.

846
01:06:07,988 --> 01:06:14,451
Just to reiterate your point, Mr. President, I guess it is obvious that the financial software isn't the only thing in this building that doesn't talk to each other.

847
01:06:15,692 --> 01:06:16,612
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

848
01:06:18,413 --> 01:06:23,496
On the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Carviello.

849
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:24,856
All those in favor?

850
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:26,077
Opposed?

851
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:27,758
Motion passes.

852
01:06:28,698 --> 01:06:29,739
The next five are mine.

853
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:35,882
I don't know if you want to... Okay, and I have no problem with joining them.

854
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:43,597
into well I have no problem with joining the first four into one motion I would like to take 22-396 separately.

855
01:06:44,738 --> 01:06:48,441
I'm on the motion of Council night to join papers 22-392, 22-393, 22-394, and 22-395 as seconded by Councilor Sang.

856
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:49,161
All those in favor?

857
01:06:49,181 --> 01:06:49,341
Opposed?

858
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:50,302
Those motions are joined.

859
01:06:57,337 --> 01:06:58,117
I will read them here.

860
01:06:58,237 --> 01:07:06,861
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration create a process to determine the actual budget needs deficit for the city of Medford's operating budget and capital needs.

861
01:07:07,921 --> 01:07:20,426
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration develop and release a revenue generation plan to eliminate the budget needs deficit, set goals and benchmarks that can be tracked and provide a clear and reasonable timeline over the next 10 years.

862
01:07:21,445 --> 01:07:36,961
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration release all information and a clear timeline for the fiscal 23 budget decision making and when any assumptions were made about the FY 23 ARPA revenue replacement calculation that led to last minute reductions in the FY 23 proposed budget.

863
01:07:37,782 --> 01:07:53,660
and be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration release a full accounting of ARPA funds spent in FY21 and FY22, share how much ARPA funding is remaining after FY22, and outline the timeline and spending plan or community outreach plan for remaining ARPA funds.

864
01:07:55,201 --> 01:07:59,106
I think those are self-explanatory on my part, so I will go to my fellow councilors for comment.

865
01:08:00,763 --> 01:08:02,725
Mr. President, I certainly support them all heartedly.

866
01:08:02,765 --> 01:08:10,052
I think these are very reflective of some of the comments that we had last week at our budget meeting when we discussed, you know, what's going on in this community from a financial standpoint.

867
01:08:10,112 --> 01:08:14,236
A lot's changed from last Tuesday to this Tuesday, obviously, with the Boston Globe coming out over the weekend.

868
01:08:14,676 --> 01:08:21,783
But ultimately, I think that these are responsible questions that make sense, that put us in a position to make smart decisions, right?

869
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:25,212
Ultimately, we wanna create a long-term successful future for our community.

870
01:08:25,252 --> 01:08:32,378
We wanna have the confidence and the ability to know that our taxpayers are gonna receive the level of services that they so deserve.

871
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:36,361
And I think that this is information that's pretty much plain and simple.

872
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:37,262
They get it in other communities.

873
01:08:37,282 --> 01:08:39,063
I don't understand why we can't get it here.

874
01:08:39,103 --> 01:08:40,064
So thank you for putting it forward.

875
01:08:40,084 --> 01:08:40,824
My supporter will have it.

876
01:08:40,844 --> 01:08:42,065
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

877
01:08:42,105 --> 01:08:42,866
Councilor Collins.

878
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:46,856
Thank you, Mr. President bears on my also look forward to supporting each of these tonight.

879
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:57,926
I just wanted to make two points in in support, the first around the measures to get some measure of transparency greater measure of transparency into our budget process.

880
01:08:58,507 --> 01:09:02,611
So often and not even just kind of constellating around this year's budget process.

881
01:09:03,292 --> 01:09:04,873
You know I hear from constituents saying.

882
01:09:05,964 --> 01:09:07,706
Why is it the roads aren't getting better?

883
01:09:07,986 --> 01:09:10,268
Why can't we improve our infrastructure?

884
01:09:10,348 --> 01:09:11,189
Why is it like this?

885
01:09:11,269 --> 01:09:12,170
Why is that like that?

886
01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:17,575
Why don't we have this resource that our neighboring communities, cities that seem similar to ours, do have?

887
01:09:18,795 --> 01:09:32,708
And I think a lot of the time, not all the time, a lot of the time, constituents, when they pose these questions to our administration and department heads, a lot of, much of the time, the answer boils down to, well, we're doing the best that we can, and that's true.

888
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:42,517
Like, no grievance that we or constituents have about the operating of this city comes down to

889
01:09:44,538 --> 01:09:52,365
a lack of skill or lack of dedication or lack of energy by any of our city staff that are tasked with taking these projects on.

890
01:09:52,725 --> 01:09:55,568
But when we say we're doing the best that we can, that's not descriptive.

891
01:09:55,888 --> 01:10:00,772
We need a better accounting of, well, why is the ceiling right here?

892
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:02,954
And is it actually enough?

893
01:10:03,395 --> 01:10:09,821
We need to get specific on everything that we're deferring, every project that we're deferring, all the priorities that we can

894
01:10:11,052 --> 01:10:15,975
talk about and write about and plan about but failed to implement because we don't have the funds.

895
01:10:16,736 --> 01:10:26,622
Like I said in our committee of the whole earlier about the school department budget, our values don't really matter for much if we can't act on them and we can't act on them if we can't fund them.

896
01:10:27,243 --> 01:10:30,245
So I think that I think that these are essential tools for both.

897
01:10:31,407 --> 01:10:39,814
being more transparent and informative with our constituent base who ultimately see the decisions that filter through or don't filter through are at a real capacity.

898
01:10:40,735 --> 01:10:52,604
And then secondly, to follow up on that, I think over the past couple of years, year and a half, the specter of ARPA has been cast over our community like it has so many.

899
01:10:53,225 --> 01:10:53,985
And I think that

900
01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:03,081
I think that there's been real room for improvement and how this funding has been talked about how it's been speculated about.

901
01:11:03,502 --> 01:11:08,411
And that's not something that I would attribute to to any one person at all, to be honest, I think that, you know,

902
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:12,322
a real historic infusion of one-time funds.

903
01:11:13,763 --> 01:11:23,284
So rapidly evolving during a rapidly evolving time, there's always gonna be ways to imagine that and then the rubber hits the road of how it can actually be implemented.

904
01:11:23,744 --> 01:11:37,307
But I think that the past couple weeks have made it clear that we need to start getting much more specific, much more concrete about how much of these funds we have left and how much will be left to implement

905
01:11:38,609 --> 01:11:40,991
community articulated priorities.

906
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:54,083
I know that we have, you know, an excellent staff member who, you know themselves is ARPA funded, working on this very project of making sure that we're being responsible with our ARPA funding, but I also think that there's been a lot of competing narratives

907
01:11:55,024 --> 01:12:05,268
about how much money is available, how much will be directed with the input of the community, what goes through the council, what doesn't go through the council.

908
01:12:05,368 --> 01:12:13,031
I just think that there's a real lack of clarity that, again, is not the fault of any one person at all.

909
01:12:13,151 --> 01:12:20,735
But I think we need to start cleaning that up right now, because this is such a live issue, not just in this funding cycle, but clearly for the next one as well.

910
01:12:21,455 --> 01:12:22,735
So I thank you for putting these forward.

911
01:12:22,815 --> 01:12:23,516
I think they're essential.

912
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:27,997
And I hope that we can partner with the administration on really seeing these through.

913
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:30,679
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

914
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,700
Councilor Caviello.

915
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:32,901
Thank you, Mr. President.

916
01:12:33,101 --> 01:12:38,646
And again, we're not looking to find faults, we're looking to find solutions.

917
01:12:39,046 --> 01:12:39,686
That's what it is.

918
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:41,588
We're not looking to blame.

919
01:12:41,988 --> 01:12:43,810
How do we get here and how do we get out of it?

920
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:45,691
That's the goal for everybody here.

921
01:12:46,772 --> 01:12:47,112
Thank you.

922
01:12:47,153 --> 01:12:47,613
Councilor Saint.

923
01:12:48,367 --> 01:13:00,239
I think what this council wants and what constituents are demanding is that we, as a city have better long term planning have more accountability you know these are basic standards of city government or of any government.

924
01:13:01,060 --> 01:13:05,023
And so I'm going to keep it simple, simple, I support this wholeheartedly.

925
01:13:06,144 --> 01:13:11,209
And, you know, these are resolutions that will really help I think.

926
01:13:12,130 --> 01:13:21,459
will really set us on a course forward towards the, you know, towards a better budget in the future and to make sure that we're not caught so last minute in the future.

927
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:23,881
So I thank you for putting this on the agenda tonight.

928
01:13:24,061 --> 01:13:28,745
Thank you, Councilor Sagan.

929
01:13:28,845 --> 01:13:35,691
If someone could offer an amendment from the floor, just to that these be immediately disseminated to the

930
01:13:36,802 --> 01:13:41,204
mayor's office of the chief of staff, instead of waiting one week for the records to be approved.

931
01:13:41,325 --> 01:13:41,705
So moved.

932
01:13:42,945 --> 01:13:44,066
So moved by councilor Seng.

933
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:53,331
On the motion of councilor Carabiello, seconded by councilor Collins to approve as amended by councilor Seng.

934
01:13:54,312 --> 01:13:55,432
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

935
01:13:58,814 --> 01:14:01,836
Yes, seconded by councilor Carabiello as amended by councilor Seng.

936
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:07,864
Yes.

937
01:14:19,115 --> 01:14:21,536
Yes, 16 affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

938
01:14:22,456 --> 01:14:46,283
Again, if no one minds me reading from the chair, this is 22-396 offered by Vice President Behrs, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that no later than July 14th, 2022, the mayor and city administration must demonstrate in writing that a proposition two and a half override is not needed to end the short-term structural deficit and avoid further budget and service cuts in the FY24 budget, as was previously stated by members of the city administration in recent meetings.

939
01:14:47,012 --> 01:14:54,754
be it for the result that the city administration will explain the alternative option they will be using to end the structural deficit while avoiding further budget and service cuts in fiscal year 2024.

940
01:14:55,494 --> 01:15:11,238
This one's a little bit less self-explanatory, so I will just add, as we saw in previous meetings, and then we actually heard in the Boston Globe, and we read in the Boston Globe, the plan right now for the budget issues that we're in in the short term is to keep cutting.

941
01:15:12,418 --> 01:15:14,859
I don't think that that's a solution that the people of Medford want.

942
01:15:17,504 --> 01:15:27,597
If there is a potential alternative plan, the statutory deadline for anything to be considered this year relative to an override is August 3rd, it would have to be submitted to the Secretary of State's office.

943
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:40,517
All this resolution is saying is I would like the mayor to demonstrate to us what is the alternative that she is proposing to avoid budget cuts, you know, and not use and not raise revenue through this process.

944
01:15:40,557 --> 01:15:42,818
So that's the intent of this resolution.

945
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:50,342
I said July 14th, because that would allow us some time to consider whatever response we get and then make an informed decision based on the information we have.

946
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:52,483
So that's the intent of this resolution.

947
01:15:52,543 --> 01:15:55,085
It's certainly not anything more than that at this time.

948
01:15:55,825 --> 01:16:09,193
So Councilor Baez, as I'm understanding this, this is more of a planning tool than actually a step towards putting an override measure on the ballot, but more or less a planning tool is to say to the mayor, Madam Mayor, we see what's going on in this community.

949
01:16:09,654 --> 01:16:11,635
Do you see something different?

950
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:14,697
And if you do, how are you gonna tackle it financially?

951
01:16:15,377 --> 01:16:21,541
So I just wanna be very clear that this isn't the beginning of a two and a half override ballot question.

952
01:16:21,581 --> 01:16:22,142
What this is,

953
01:16:23,082 --> 01:16:28,525
us getting information from the city administration necessary for us to make a determination as to what direction the city is going to go in.

954
01:16:28,665 --> 01:16:28,865
Correct.

955
01:16:28,885 --> 01:16:36,328
But this is a planning tool really where it's we're asking the administration to say this is where we are this is where we need to be how can we get there without doing this.

956
01:16:36,828 --> 01:16:37,128
Right.

957
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:39,249
Not we need to do this so immediately do it.

958
01:16:39,449 --> 01:16:40,070
Exactly.

959
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:48,534
Yeah and again my intention here is to say if it can be at all avoided just show us how you're going to avoid it that's that's all this resolution is asking for.

960
01:16:48,554 --> 01:16:49,414
Move approved.

961
01:16:49,754 --> 01:16:50,074
Thank you.

962
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:50,394
Second.

963
01:16:50,514 --> 01:16:51,295
Any further comment?

964
01:16:52,518 --> 01:16:55,381
On the motion of Councilor Nye to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

965
01:16:55,401 --> 01:16:56,362
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

966
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:07,355
And could this also, actually, could there be an amendment from the floor that this also be amended by Councilor saying that this be immediately submitted to the Mayor and Chief of Staff?

967
01:17:43,471 --> 01:17:43,531
Yes.

968
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:43,611

All those opposed motion passes 22 dash 398 offered by Councillor saying be it resolved that the Metro City Council requested the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, communicate its bus network redesign plan to and solicit feedback from residents in senior living facilities and nursing homes

1081
01:18:32,658 --> 01:18:39,744
Thank you, Councilor bears, this is a response to the public participation that we heard last week.

1082
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:47,630
And, frankly, to also for free for feedback that I've been receiving that I'm and seeing online.

1083
01:18:48,931 --> 01:19:02,523
in my email and on Facebook that the MBTA redesign plan has, you know, there's still a lot of people who are left out of the current communication plan, especially those living in senior living facilities and in nursing homes.

1084
01:19:03,764 --> 01:19:11,270
And, you know, these are people who might have to use the MBTA bus services or who have people visiting them who use MBTA bus services.

1085
01:19:11,751 --> 01:19:13,692
And so they deserve

1086
01:19:14,553 --> 01:19:21,558
just as with anyone else to, you know, to be able to give feedback to this bus redesign network bus network redesign plan.

1087
01:19:22,038 --> 01:19:34,707
And so this is a simple resolution to ask the MBTA to communicate with those living in Medford, who might not have had that chance to hear about the back to the plane yet.

1088
01:19:35,668 --> 01:19:37,850
On the motion of Councilor saying seconded by Councilor night.

1089
01:19:38,430 --> 01:19:39,070
All those in favor.

1090
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,092
I oppose motion passes.

1091
01:19:42,086 --> 01:19:54,116
22 dash 399 offered by counselor saying be resolved the director of diversity, equity inclusion and share that all city communications are inclusive of all necessary information for residents without access to computers or the internet counselor.

1092
01:19:54,257 --> 01:20:05,626
This is, again, something that we heard from on public participation and something that I know it's been of concern to a lot of residents, we want to make sure that you know when the city is communicating information.

1093
01:20:06,747 --> 01:20:11,330
you don't have to have a computer or you don't have to have access to the internet to get that information.

1094
01:20:12,871 --> 01:20:20,215
We want to make sure that no one's being left out of our messaging campaigns and no one's not receiving information.

1095
01:20:20,635 --> 01:20:26,579
And so this is another simple resolution to ask the DEI director

1096
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:33,003
to make sure that our city communications are being inclusive.

1097
01:20:33,123 --> 01:20:39,006
And I think this is something that completely matches with her goals that she was telling the council when she was before us.

1098
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,228
Thank you, Councilor Singh.

1099
01:20:41,428 --> 01:20:43,509
On the motion of Councilor Singh, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1100
01:20:44,009 --> 01:20:44,790
Any further discussion?

1101
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:47,411
All those in favor?

1102
01:20:47,952 --> 01:20:48,452
Opposed?

1103
01:20:48,672 --> 01:20:49,553
Motion passes.

1104
01:20:52,334 --> 01:20:56,217
Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk by Councilor Knight, seconded by

1105
01:20:57,411 --> 01:20:58,575
Seconded by Councilor Kerrio.

1106
01:20:58,615 --> 01:20:59,377
All those in favor?

1107
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:00,621
Opposed?

1108
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:01,444
Motion passes.

1109
01:21:01,464 --> 01:21:01,484
22-410.

1110
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:25,012
We're offered by counselor night, whereas the city of Medford faces a structural deficit within its operating budget be it so resolved, the city administration examine the feasibility of increasing the amount of certain fines and fees to create revenue to offset the budgetary gap and be a further result of the city administration provide the council with this analysis prior to the close of the fiscal year counselor night.

1111
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:26,432
Mr President, thank you very much.

1112
01:21:26,513 --> 01:21:34,558
I'm just just a few minutes earlier this evening we had a gentleman before us who talked a little bit about a project that he wanted to do in an old to district that we just created.

1113
01:21:35,257 --> 01:21:41,861
And as part of that discussion, we talked about how much money would be generated through these property taxes, right?

1114
01:21:42,601 --> 01:21:48,024
And I'm just trying to find my notes here because I want to see how much money he said it was in permits.

1115
01:21:50,925 --> 01:21:54,667
It was $15 per thousand square feet for the project.

1116
01:21:55,128 --> 01:21:59,790
So I'm wondering, Mr. President, with the number of life science projects that are now coming online here in the community,

1117
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:19,222
and with the structural deficit that we see, whether or not it would make sense for us to raise that or to even attach permitting fees to the rate of inflation so that we don't have to get to a situation where annually or biannually or semi-annually or, I mean, quite frankly, I don't think these things have been looked at since the McGlynn administration.

1118
01:22:19,242 --> 01:22:28,308
They can self-adjust based upon the inflation rate annually, as opposed to us having to pass an ordinance every year saying that this is what they're going to be.

1119
01:22:29,067 --> 01:22:36,370
So I think it might be an opportunity for us to generate some revenue to close the budget gap, and to do so in a way that's going to be recurring and not be on the back of the residential taxpayer.

1120
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:42,392
Thank you, Councilor night in the paper Mr President, I will withdraw, by the way, Councilor Carol.

1121
01:22:42,432 --> 01:22:43,893
Thank you.

1122
01:22:43,953 --> 01:22:53,277
Um, maybe we don't look at what other other communities trash, we don't, again, we don't even know when the last time this has gone up, though, is the building department chance to

1123
01:22:54,512 --> 01:23:02,036
I'm sure they communicate with the local cities and see what our neighboring communities are charging for that rate.

1124
01:23:03,497 --> 01:23:05,518
I second this motion.

1125
01:23:06,559 --> 01:23:06,899
Thank you.

1126
01:23:06,919 --> 01:23:07,919
Any further discussion?

1127
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,321
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carriello.

1128
01:23:11,381 --> 01:23:12,202
All those in favor?

1129
01:23:12,622 --> 01:23:13,022
Opposed?

1130
01:23:13,082 --> 01:23:15,263
Motion passes.

1131
01:23:15,283 --> 01:23:20,926
22-411, be it so resolved that the city administration examine the feasibility of auctioning off surplus.

1132
01:23:20,966 --> 01:23:21,787
Oh, my apologies.

1133
01:23:21,867 --> 01:23:22,247
Withdrawn.

1134
01:23:26,056 --> 01:23:28,057
Hold on, I want to make sure there's nothing left on here.

1135
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:36,299
Yes.

1136
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:45,962
Since the motion that Councilor Knight withdrew was was offered under suspension and that was never actually on the agenda, does that go on to the records or does that not go on to the records?

1137
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:46,563
I don't believe it.

1138
01:23:47,343 --> 01:23:48,143
It was never introduced.

1139
01:23:48,163 --> 01:23:48,363
Yeah.

1140
01:23:50,044 --> 01:23:54,125
All right, I'm gonna just, I know we have a potential motion to adjourn, but

1141
01:23:54,974 --> 01:24:03,040
Just wanna give one last opportunity, public participation, anyone in the audience here or anyone on Zoom, you can raise your hand for public participation, please let us know.

1142
01:24:13,827 --> 01:24:20,692
Seeing none, I will entertain Councilor Knight's motion to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1143
01:24:20,732 --> 01:24:21,372
All those in favor?

1144
01:24:21,852 --> 01:24:22,633
All those opposed?

1145
01:24:22,653 --> 01:24:23,874
The meeting is adjourned.

1146
01:24:25,125 --> 01:24:27,981
and we will be convening tomorrow at 6 p.m.

1147
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:29,147
for further budget hearings.

1148
01:24:29,187 --> 01:24:29,468
Thank you.
