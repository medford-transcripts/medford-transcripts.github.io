1
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:34,940
In 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison brought the only legal case ever filed in connection with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

2
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:42,233
The trial was a strange, sprawling, and ultimately unsuccessful affair.

3
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:49,236
Garrison accused a local businessman, Clay Shaw, of participating in a conspiracy.

4
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:58,159
But the prosecution's evidence was thin, the testimony inconsistent, and the theories increasingly convoluted.

5
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,682
Under pressure, Garrison's narrative began to twist in on itself.

6
00:01:04,537 --> 00:01:12,682
relying not on proof, but on the idea that a conspiracy so vast would leave no evidence at all.

7
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:18,706
In other words, the absence of proof became the proof.

8
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:32,134
When Oliver Stone dramatized the trial in his 1991 film, JFK, he gave Garrison, played by Kevin Costner, a monologue that has since become iconic.

9
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:49,272
In challenging the official explanation of the assassination, particularly the so-called magic bullet theory, Garrison scoffs... Theoretical physics can prove that an elephant can hang from a cliff with its tail tied to a daisy.

10
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,594
But use your eyes, your common sense.

11
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:58,036
The army wound ballistics experts at Edward Arsenal filed some comparison bullets.

12
00:01:58,696 --> 00:02:00,397
Not one of them looked anything like this.

13
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:03,233
It's a powerful moment.

14
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:06,015
The jury is enraptured.

15
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:08,736
But here's the catch.

16
00:02:09,737 --> 00:02:14,940
That common-sense reaction is based on a flawed assumption.

17
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:31,500
The magic bullet theory seems ridiculous if you imagine the car seats aligned perfectly, one behind the other.

18
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:41,007
But in reality, Governor Connolly was seated in a jump seat, lower and to the left of Kennedy.

19
00:02:42,047 --> 00:02:48,332
When you factor that in, the bullet's path, far from magical, becomes plausible.

20
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:51,568
And that's the point.

21
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,629
What feels true often isn't.

22
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,730
Common sense fills in gaps with familiarity.

23
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,511
It makes assumptions.

24
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:03,931
It skips the hard part.

25
00:03:04,772 --> 00:03:19,055
And while that's fine when you're deciding how to cross the street or whether the stove is hot, it fails spectacularly when we step into the strange, unfamiliar and counterintuitive.

26
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:30,793
From black holes to probability, consciousness to investment strategy, the world rarely behaves the way we expect it to.

27
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:40,861
Sometimes the most dangerous thing isn't what we don't know, it's what we're sure we do.

28
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,228
Take your own mind, for instance.

29
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:14,236
Few things feel more self-evident than the idea that we control our thoughts and actions.

30
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:23,743
From childhood, we're taught that we make choices, deliberate over our actions, and bear responsibility for them.

31
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:36,879
The notion of free will, that we are autonomous agents steering our destinies, is deeply ingrained in human culture, ethics, and law.

32
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,482
Yet neuroscience suggests that this perception of conscious control may be an illusion.

33
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:56,916
Studies using brain imaging technology, such as fMRI and EEG scans, have revealed that decisions are often made before we are consciously aware of them.

34
00:04:57,736 --> 00:05:11,942
In the 1980s, neuroscientist Benjamin Libet conducted a groundbreaking experiment in which participants were asked to move their fingers at a moment of their choosing while their brain activity was monitored.

35
00:05:12,997 --> 00:05:25,245
Libet found that the readiness potential, a pattern of neural activity linked to movement, appeared hundreds of milliseconds before participants reported making a conscious decision.

36
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:39,936
More recent studies have extended this time gap to several seconds, suggesting that the unconscious brain initiates decisions long before we experience the sensation of making a choice.

37
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,940
If the brain is making decisions before we are aware of them, what does this mean for free will?

38
00:05:48,106 --> 00:06:02,397
One possibility is that consciousness is not the initiator of decisions, but rather a narrator, creating a post-hoc story to justify actions that have already been set into motion.

39
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:15,847
This implies that what we experience as a conscious choice is, in fact, a retrospective illusion, making us passengers rather than pilots of our own minds.

40
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,352
The question of consciousness itself only deepens the mystery.

41
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:45,987
Unlike other bodily functions, such as digestion or respiration, consciousness does not have a clearly identifiable structure in the brain.

42
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:59,742
It is not located in a single region, but appears to be an emergent property of billions of neurons firing in concert across distributed networks.

43
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:17,567
While we can pinpoint certain areas of the brain responsible for perception, emotion, and decision-making, there is no single seat of the self, no homunculus sitting inside the brain directing thoughts.

44
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:24,150
This fragmentation of self-awareness has profound implications.

45
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:37,506
If the self is not a unified entity, but a collection of competing neural processes, what does that say about identity, agency, and personal responsibility?

46
00:07:38,447 --> 00:07:51,530
Disorders such as split-brain syndrome, which occurs when the corpus callosum connecting the brain's hemispheres is severed, reveal that the brain can house multiple independent streams of consciousness.

47
00:07:52,548 --> 00:08:12,446
Patients with this condition often exhibit bizarre behaviours, such as one hand acting in direct opposition to the other, suggesting that even within a single individual, there may not be a singular coherent self, but multiple, competing selves.

48
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:26,085
If we aren't the sole authors of our thoughts, if consciousness is less a spotlight and more a shadow play, then what exactly are we?

49
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:49,726
Where does something as rich and layered as human experience come from, if not from a central self pulling the levers?

50
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:55,810
That question leads us to one of the most counterintuitive truths of all.

51
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,054
Common sense tells us that complexity must stem from equally complex causes.

52
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:10,019
We assume intricate systems, whether biological, cognitive, or cosmic,

53
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,051
require an intelligent designer.

54
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:23,015
Yet nature repeatedly demonstrates that complexity emerges from simple rules without foresight or intent.

55
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:40,695
One of the most striking examples of emergent complexity is evolution.

56
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:47,680
The human body, with its vast interdependent systems, seems irreducibly complex.

57
00:09:48,341 --> 00:10:00,730
Yet Darwinian evolution explains how small, random genetic mutations, shaped by natural selection, have gradually built intricate life forms.

58
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,932
No guiding intelligence is necessary.

59
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:08,976
only time, variation, and survival pressures.

60
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:19,425
What appears designed is actually the result of millions of tiny, unguided changes accumulating over time.

61
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:31,015
Human intuition struggles with this idea, because our brains expect immediate cause-and-effect relationships, not processes spanning billions of years.

62
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:41,546
Evolution's slow, incremental nature contradicts our instinct to see purpose and intention in complex structures.

63
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:59,455
Evolution, neuroscience, fractals, and self-organization all reveal that complexity does not require an architect, only the right conditions and enough time.

64
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:14,028
While common sense suggests that intricate systems must be designed, reality proves that profound order can emerge from seemingly mindless simplicity.

65
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:35,957
If simplicity can give rise to complexity, then it shouldn't surprise us that randomness too can give rise to patterns.

66
00:11:37,158 --> 00:11:38,138
But here's the catch.

67
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,600
Our brains weren't built to recognise this.

68
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:58,698
We are natural-born storytellers, not statisticians, and when we try to make sense of randomness, we often see cause where there is none, or miss the invisible structure underneath it all.

69
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,683
This is especially true when it comes to probability.

70
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,854
Humans are notoriously bad at intuiting probability.

71
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:35,967
We tend to overestimate rare dangers while underestimating common risks, leading to irrational fears and poor decision-making.

72
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:47,658
This is why people are more afraid of plane crashes than car accidents, even though air travel is statistically far safer.

73
00:12:48,639 --> 00:13:01,490
Similarly, many people feel more anxious about shark attacks than slipping in their own bathrooms, even though the latter is exponentially more likely to cause injury or death.

74
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:13,427
Our inability to grasp probability leads to flawed reasoning, poor risk assessment, and widespread misconceptions about chance.

75
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:34,441
A famous example of counterintuitive probability is the infinite monkey theorem, which states that if a monkey were to randomly hit keys on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time, it would eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare.

76
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:39,211
At first glance, this sounds absurd.

77
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:45,516
How could randomness generate something as structured and meaningful as Hamlet?

78
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:58,626
But mathematically, given infinite time, the probability of the monkey producing any finite sequence of text approaches certainty.

79
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,623
However, many people misunderstand the implications of this theorem.

80
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:13,025
First, the term infinite is crucial.

81
00:14:13,906 --> 00:14:23,371
In a finite time frame, even trillions of years, the likelihood of producing Shakespeare's works is astronomically low.

82
00:14:24,711 --> 00:14:34,613
Second, while pure randomness does guarantee all possible outcomes given enough time, it does not guarantee efficiency.

83
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:52,458
The vast majority of what the monkey would type would be gibberish, and the occurrence of Shakespearean text would be so rare that even if we watched for billions of lifetimes, we might never see a coherent sentence emerge.

84
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:21,508
Some critics argue that the theorem, while mathematically valid, is a misleading representation of how randomness works in the real world, where meaningful structure rarely emerges from chaos without some guiding mechanism.

85
00:15:22,849 --> 00:15:29,712
The failure to intuit probability is perhaps nowhere more evident than in gambling.

86
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:43,749
One of the most common misconceptions gamblers fall for is the gambler's fallacy, the belief that past random events influence future random outcomes.

87
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:57,265
A classic example is a person playing roulette who sees black come up five times in a row and assumes that red is now due for a win.

88
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:01,707
But each spin of the wheel is independent.

89
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:07,169
Previous outcomes have no effect on future ones.

90
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:17,961
Humans evolved in environments where probability was not explicitly calculated, but rather intuited based on experience.

91
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:23,563
Our ancestors did not need to compute precise risks.

92
00:16:24,164 --> 00:16:34,428
They relied on heuristics, mental shortcuts that worked well enough for survival, but are often misleading in modern contexts.

93
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:46,174
This is why people struggle with large numbers and fail to grasp just how unlikely certain events are.

94
00:17:01,541 --> 00:17:12,803
We can't help but anthropomorphise randomness, imagine luck as a force, see patterns in static, or believe that odds even out.

95
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:25,186
But even when we do try to wrap our heads around large numbers, there's one concept that short-circuits intuition entirely.

96
00:17:26,326 --> 00:17:27,086
Infinity.

97
00:17:40,154 --> 00:17:47,516
It feels like just a really big number, something beyond a trillion or a googol.

98
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:52,097
But infinity isn't a number at all.

99
00:17:52,898 --> 00:18:01,100
It's a boundless abstraction, and it behaves in ways that defy common sense at every turn.

100
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:12,142
Our brains evolved to count and measure things in finite quantities, but infinity refuses to be tamed.

101
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:16,284
We instinctively think in terms of limits.

102
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:26,309
Objects have edges, time has a beginning and an end, and numbers, while large, should still be countable.

103
00:18:28,103 --> 00:18:34,485
However, mathematics reveals that infinity behaves in ways that contradict our common sense.

104
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:44,128
Consider the paradox of Hilbert's infinite hotel, a famous thought experiment devised by German mathematician David Hilbert.

105
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:52,350
Imagine a hotel with an infinite number of rooms, each already occupied by a guest.

106
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:58,747
If a new traveller arrives, logic would suggest that the hotel is full.

107
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:15,460
However, by shifting each guest one room over – moving the guest in room 1 to room 2, the guest in room 2 to room 3, and so on – room 1 becomes available for the new arrival.

108
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:27,943
This process can be repeated indefinitely, meaning that despite being full, the hotel can always accommodate more guests.

109
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:33,986
This paradox exposes the unintuitive nature of infinity.

110
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:47,773
Unlike finite sets where adding more elements increases the total count, infinite sets can be rearranged in paradoxical ways while still remaining infinite.

111
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:55,218
Even more bizarre is the fact that some infinities are larger than others.

112
00:19:56,177 --> 00:20:16,537
The most famous example of this comes from the work of mathematician George Cantor, who discovered that the set of real numbers, including all decimals and fractions, between 0 and 1, is larger than the set of all whole numbers, despite both being infinite.

113
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:27,356
This is because whole numbers, regardless of their size, can still be counted sequentially, meaning they form a countable infinity.

114
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:41,946
However, the real numbers between 0 and 1 include an uncountably infinite number of decimal variations, making it an uncountably infinite set.

115
00:20:43,775 --> 00:21:03,045
Cantor proved this by using his diagonalization argument, which shows that no matter how you try to list the real numbers, there will always be numbers left out, demonstrating that this infinity is provably larger than the infinity of whole numbers.

116
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:20,318
Should your brain be aching or your nose bleeding?

117
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:21,939
Don't worry.

118
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,661
That is rather the point.

119
00:21:25,422 --> 00:21:31,686
Concepts such as this are entirely counter to that which we can understand instinctively.

120
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:40,212
These ideas seem paradoxical because our brains are wired to grasp quantities in physical terms,

121
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:46,314
We can count apples, measure distances, and track time.

122
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:52,056
But when we enter the realm of boundlessness, our intuition fails us.

123
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:58,659
Infinity is not just a concept beyond our everyday experience.

124
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,322
It is something that actively breaks the way we understand the world.

125
00:22:18,264 --> 00:22:24,448
Infinity forces us to confront how ill-equipped we are to grasp the boundless.

126
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:31,631
But if the idea of something stretching forever breaks the mind, consider the opposite.

127
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:33,893
Nothing at all.

128
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:54,112
At first glance, nothing seems simpler.

129
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:58,775
Its absence, emptiness, the void.

130
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:07,421
Yet physics tells us that true nothingness doesn't exist and may never have.

131
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:18,904
The concept of nothing seems straightforward, an absence of something, a void where no matter, energy or structure exists.

132
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:27,147
Common sense tells us that if you remove everything from a space, what remains is nothing.

133
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:36,350
But modern physics reveals that nothing is far more complicated than our intuition suggests.

134
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:43,993
Even in the most seemingly empty vacuum, something is always happening.

135
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:55,238
And the very notion of absolute nothingness becomes paradoxical when examined through the lens of quantum mechanics and cosmology.

136
00:23:56,398 --> 00:24:01,860
Even in the absence of matter, empty space is not truly empty.

137
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:32,207
At the quantum level, what we perceive as nothingness is actually a seething, chaotic ocean of virtual particles that constantly appear and disappear.

138
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:44,897
These ephemeral particles, known as quantum fluctuations, momentarily appear and then annihilate one another, creating tiny but measurable effects.

139
00:24:46,792 --> 00:24:51,513
The famous Casimir effect illustrates this peculiar phenomenon.

140
00:24:52,273 --> 00:25:02,035
When two uncharged metal plates are placed extremely close together in a vacuum, they experience a force pushing them together.

141
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:11,217
Not due to any external pressure, but because quantum fluctuations between them are slightly different than those outside.

142
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:24,595
This effect is direct physical evidence that even in a vacuum, space itself is active, dynamic, and filled with energy.

143
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:29,317
This leads to an even more unsettling conclusion.

144
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:41,104
The vacuum of space is not a passive backdrop, but a fundamental part of the universe with measurable properties and consequences.

145
00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:51,312
What we once considered nothing is in fact a deeply complex and structured fabric of reality.

146
00:25:52,673 --> 00:26:03,280
If nothing at the quantum level is already an illusion, what about the concept of nothingness before the universe existed?

147
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,183
Our minds naturally assume that everything must have an origin.

148
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:11,865
But if the universe had a beginning,

149
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,266
than what came before it.

150
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:20,209
The question itself reveals the limits of human intuition.

151
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:26,373
Time itself is believed to have been created with the Big Bang.

152
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:36,479
Meaning the phrase, before the universe, may be as meaningless as asking, what's north of the North Pole?

153
00:26:50,559 --> 00:27:03,883
But if the quantum vacuum reveals that even nothing is not what it seems, then what do we call the empty spaces where common sense should reside, but doesn't?

154
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:23,320
Let's return to that New Orleans courtroom in Oliver Stone's JFK, a film that turned doubt into drama, and speculation into something like scripture.

155
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:37,367
Jim Garrison stands confidently, almost smugly, before the jury, delivering a powerful closing argument, relying heavily on this one magic bullet.

156
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:52,495
If Kennedy was shot from behind, Garrison argues, then how could Governor Connolly, seated ahead of him, have been struck by the same bullet that resulted in so many distinct wounds?

157
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:53,495
It's absurd.

158
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:56,476
It's theatrical.

159
00:27:56,576 --> 00:27:57,196
And it feels right.

160
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:10,378
But it's wrong.

161
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:17,902
The so-called magic bullet theory is not magical at all.

162
00:28:18,682 --> 00:28:20,563
It's forensic ballistics.

163
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:23,865
But the damage had already been done.

164
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:32,529
The emotional appeal of Garrison's argument bypassed logic and landed straight in the gut.

165
00:28:33,861 --> 00:28:36,243
That's the real danger.

166
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:40,446
What feels true often isn't.

167
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:45,029
In this case, common sense wasn't just wrong.

168
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:52,494
It actively distorted reality, because it filled in gaps with assumptions.

169
00:28:54,015 --> 00:28:58,438
Garrison's argument was effective because it bypassed critical thinking.

170
00:28:59,078 --> 00:29:03,041
It leveraged the power of simplicity over complexity.

171
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:06,908
instinct over evidence.

172
00:29:08,468 --> 00:29:12,269
And this tactic isn't just confined to movies.

173
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:14,889
It's everywhere now.

174
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:45,908
Today, common sense is used not only to dismiss ideas, but also to discredit people, especially experts.

175
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:55,851
Somewhere along the way, being an expert stopped being admirable and began to be viewed with suspicion.

176
00:29:56,912 --> 00:30:03,694
The very word expert now often carries a negative connotation in public discourse,

177
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:13,356
as if years of study, experience and evidence-based thinking are viewed as red flags rather than qualifications.

178
00:30:14,632 --> 00:30:18,014
This isn't just cultural fatigue.

179
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:27,359
It's a performative rebellion against institutions, academia, science, and media.

180
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:35,964
Against anything that seems too complex, too elite, or too difficult to grasp at a glance.

181
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:42,347
Instead of saying, I don't understand that, can you explain?

182
00:30:43,448 --> 00:30:49,734
We're increasingly hearing, I don't understand that, so it must be a lie.

183
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:56,159
And this mindset opens the door to conspiracy thinking.

184
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:03,546
If a claim contradicts what feels intuitive,

185
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,363
It's not just wrong, it must be deceptive.

186
00:31:09,703 --> 00:31:13,286
Climate scientists have become part of a global hoax.

187
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:18,369
Virologists are accused of inventing pandemics.

188
00:31:19,449 --> 00:31:24,332
Mental health professionals are dismissed as peddlers of made-up disorders.

189
00:31:25,313 --> 00:31:32,718
Engineers explaining 5G technology are met with suspicion, not curiosity.

190
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:45,700
Even the shape of the Earth is up for debate again, as if centuries of measurement and observation can be outweighed by gut feeling.

191
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:51,084
What's dangerous here isn't just misinformation.

192
00:31:51,865 --> 00:31:56,889
It's the growing assumption that any form of complexity is a con.

193
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:03,074
That if something doesn't align with your intuition, it must be part of a plot.

194
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:08,205
that truth should be obvious, simple, and easily felt.

195
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:13,827
And if it's not, someone's probably hiding something.

196
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,351
But truth is often not intuitive.

197
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:28,472
It takes effort.

198
00:32:29,192 --> 00:32:33,394
It takes uncomfortable revisions to what we thought we knew.

199
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:44,538
And yes, it takes listening to people who've dedicated their lives to understanding things most of us haven't had time to study.

200
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:49,723
We can and should question power.

201
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,645
We should demand transparency.

202
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:57,869
But scepticism is not the same as cynicism.

203
00:32:59,173 --> 00:33:03,016
Real skepticism looks for better evidence.

204
00:33:04,037 --> 00:33:06,519
Cynicism looks for villains.

205
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,223
And that difference matters.

206
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:29,379
Because if we reject every uncomfortable truth in favour of what feels right, we end up not just misinformed, but manipulated, ironically, by the very forces we think we're resisting.

207
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,743
Common sense is helpful, essential even, for getting through the day.

208
00:33:36,444 --> 00:33:41,188
It tells us not to touch hot stoves, not to walk into traffic,

209
00:33:41,891 --> 00:33:45,193
Not to trust someone who gives us a bad feeling.

210
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:49,977
It's the brain's shortcut system, built from experience.

211
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:57,342
But when we're dealing with the big stuff, how time works, what consciousness is,

212
00:33:58,264 --> 00:34:05,630
how probability behaves, or why a bullet can curve in ways that don't feel right.

213
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:12,076
That same shortcut system can lead us wildly off course.

214
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:27,305
Understanding where our intuition falls short is how we grow.

215
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:31,926
It's not a sign that we're stupid or out of touch.

216
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:39,208
It's a sign that we're curious, open, and willing to stretch beyond what's familiar.

217
00:34:40,229 --> 00:34:43,890
That's where every great scientific discovery has come from.

218
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:51,332
Not from trusting gut instinct, but from saying, wait, what if I'm wrong?

219
00:34:53,448 --> 00:34:55,749
But that requires trust.

220
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:57,489
In a process.

221
00:34:58,509 --> 00:34:59,630
Not a person.

222
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,911
One of the most dangerous trends of our time is the growing distrust of science.

223
00:35:06,791 --> 00:35:13,653
Not of individual studies or researchers – healthy scepticism of findings is part of the process.

224
00:35:14,593 --> 00:35:24,116
but a broad ontological suspicion of science itself, as if science were a belief system or bureaucratic cabal.

225
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:25,776
It's not.

226
00:35:26,957 --> 00:35:31,338
Science is not the discipline of stating the obvious.

227
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,039
It doesn't promise to be right forever.

228
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,841
In fact, its greatest strength is that it doesn't try to be.

229
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:46,135
Good science doesn't say, this is the final truth.

230
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:56,400
It says, this is what the evidence tells us right now, until something better is proven.

231
00:35:57,461 --> 00:36:00,262
It's not a priesthood, it's a process.

232
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:05,785
Often slow, often frustrating, but it works.

233
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:10,447
And the proof is everywhere.

234
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:28,912
We now accept without hesitation that the Earth orbits the Sun, a fact that once seemed laughable and heretical.

235
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:40,618
We accept the germ theory that diseases are caused by invisible organisms, not curses, bad air, or divine punishment.

236
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:47,182
These were once revolutionary ideas that contradicted everything people believed.

237
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:56,186
However, over time, with evidence, replication and refinement, they became established facts.

238
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:02,527
Not because someone powerful said so, but because the method worked.

239
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:05,087
It's not a cathedral.

240
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,228
It's a construction site.

241
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:17,250
The motto of the Royal Society, one of the oldest scientific institutions in the world, is Nullius Inverba.

242
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,643
take nobody's word for it.

243
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:24,524
Or, more plainly, prove it.

244
00:37:25,804 --> 00:37:27,185
That's the point.

245
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,345
Not authority, not certainty.

246
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:32,026
Evidence.

247
00:37:33,906 --> 00:37:42,547
The truth is, nobody's born knowing how relativity works, or how to read the stock market, or diagnose a heart attack.

248
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:45,508
These things are learned.

249
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:56,548
And the first step in learning anything meaningful is being willing to admit that your instincts might not be enough.

250
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:02,751
So the next time something feels obvious, take a beat.

251
00:38:03,911 --> 00:38:08,494
Ask yourself if it only feels true because it's familiar.

252
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:26,763
Because once you start looking beyond what feels right and start chasing what is right, even when it's strange, even when it's uncomfortable, that's where real understanding begins.

253
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:31,804
It's not about throwing away common sense.

254
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:35,445
It's about knowing when to disregard it.

255
00:38:36,667 --> 00:38:39,028
That's how we move forward.

256
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:54,617
That's how we make sense of a world and a universe that so often seems, seems to stubbornly refuse to make sense of itself.

257
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:05,844
And as for the headache and the nosebleed, turn the lights off.

258
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,342
Take a Tylenol, lean your head back, and don't worry about the details and jargon too much.

259
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:18,603
If you don't understand everything you've heard, you're in good company.

260
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:20,283
Most of us don't.

261
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:21,864
And can't.

262
00:39:23,484 --> 00:39:25,965
At least, not commonly.
