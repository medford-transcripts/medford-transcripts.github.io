[SPEAKER_08]: MASC Delegate Assembly Report.

41
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:19,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

42
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:24,579
[SPEAKER_15]: On Wednesday, November 2nd, I had the opportunity to attend the Mass.

43
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Association School Committee Delegate

44
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:27,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Assembly in Hyannis.

45
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:31,337
[SPEAKER_15]: The meeting began at 3.15 in the Ballroom in the Conference Center.

46
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:41,720
[SPEAKER_15]: There were representatives from school committees across the state in attendance to review and take action on the four items brought forward for the 2016 MASC Resolutions Committee.

47
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:45,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Delegate Assembly overwhelmingly supported each resolution.

48
00:03:46,346 --> 00:03:48,888
[SPEAKER_15]: As your delegated, I voted in the affirmative on each item.

49
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:59,117
[SPEAKER_15]: As directed by my fellow members in the school committee, I and several other delegates from communities across the state emphasize the importance of ensuring the funding of the foundation budget.

50
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:01,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Resolution one.

51
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:03,523
[SPEAKER_15]: be sufficient to cover all communities.

52
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,524
[SPEAKER_15]: The key words were equitable and adequate.

53
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:10,786
[SPEAKER_15]: It was recognition that all communities must benefit from any increased funding of the foundation budget.

54
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:16,508
[SPEAKER_15]: This is especially true since funding must come through the legislature back to our cities and towns.

55
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:24,171
[SPEAKER_15]: If communities are left out, then there won't be enough votes on the floor of the House or the Senate, and there won't be an appropriation that we can live with.

56
00:04:25,192 --> 00:04:27,113
[SPEAKER_15]: Resolution 2 dealt with tax reform.

57
00:04:28,033 --> 00:04:30,514
[SPEAKER_15]: This was seen as an important way to fund the foundation budget.

58
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:38,617
[SPEAKER_15]: It was great support for charter school reform, also a lot of anticipation for the ballot question, and the charter cap lift was expressed.

59
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:43,261
[SPEAKER_15]: The resolution on social and emotional well-being of students was heartily endorsed.

60
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:45,303
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the main theme of the conference.

61
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:48,386
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish to thank you for the opportunity to serve as your delegate.

62
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:52,030
[SPEAKER_15]: It is important that Medford have a voice in MASC decisions.

63
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Mr. Skerry.

64
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:54,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

65
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:54,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

66
00:04:56,872 --> 00:04:58,712
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't blinking.

67
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:02,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file this report?

68
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:05,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So moved by Mrs. Van der Klooth, seconded by Ms.

69
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:06,134
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz.

70
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:07,134
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

71
00:05:07,795 --> 00:05:08,455
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

72
00:05:08,695 --> 00:05:09,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

73
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:10,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

74
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:10,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Klooth.

75
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:14,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I do want to thank my colleague for attending and voting for us.

76
00:05:14,596 --> 00:05:18,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I also attended and we had the opportunity to talk down there.

77
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:25,739
[SPEAKER_11]: And as usual, it was, you know, interesting to hear people's discussion about the various different resolutions.

78
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:26,499
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks, Bob.

79
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:27,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

80
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:27,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

81
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:30,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Report of committees.

82
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:31,861
[SPEAKER_08]: None.

83
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:35,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Community participation.

84
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone that wishes to speak?

85
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:39,545
[SPEAKER_08]: None.

86
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:41,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Report of superintendent.

87
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:42,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on project 351.

88
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

89
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:49,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, this project has been going on for a number of years.

90
00:05:50,768 --> 00:06:06,633
[SPEAKER_14]: And this year, once again, the Governor's Office, through its Project 351, is sponsoring student ambassadors from our middle schools to attend a project activity on Martin Luther King Day and then do a year of community service.

91
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:15,536
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to call on our two principals, Paul DeLaver and Jake Edwards, if he's here, to introduce these students and talk a little bit about the program.

92
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:17,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. DeLaver.

93
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:18,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, everyone.

94
00:06:21,317 --> 00:06:22,877
[SPEAKER_13]: My student is in route.

95
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:31,959
[SPEAKER_13]: So I was hoping that maybe I could postpone my speech until he arrives, if that's okay.

96
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, thank you.

97
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to table, seconded by Ms.

98
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:36,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz.

99
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,700
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

100
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,421
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

101
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:40,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

102
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendation to approve service learning trip to Dominican Republic.

103
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

104
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:57,768
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we have representatives from the company that runs the trip, and our deputy superintendent is prepared to answer any questions you may have.

105
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:10,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember last year we had a trip to Ecuador, and we then had a trip to Washington, and we had some, you know, things we had to do, but we've worked on making sure that these things are in place, so let them present, and then you can ask any questions you might have.

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly.

107
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:21,773
[SPEAKER_10]: So, this evening we have Tori, who is one of our, Tori Glasser, who is one of our guidance Councilors, and Courtney from EF, which is the company that's sponsoring the trip.

108
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:26,814
[SPEAKER_10]: This trip, as the superintendent said, we had a similar, or Tori ran a similar trip two years ago.

109
00:07:26,874 --> 00:07:28,035
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very successful.

110
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:34,357
[SPEAKER_10]: It's interesting that some of the siblings of those students who went on the trip two years ago want to go on this trip.

111
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:38,718
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Tori put together the report giving you the details of the trip.

112
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Courtney's here to answer any questions on the company side.

113
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,521
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you have any questions about it, we'd be more than glad to take them for you.

114
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Skerry.

115
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:50,581
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Mayor, I'd like to thank Ms.

116
00:07:50,601 --> 00:07:53,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Glasser for her efforts on behalf of our students.

117
00:07:53,882 --> 00:08:01,405
[SPEAKER_15]: And as we all know, there was a slight problem the last time a group trip was planned in Washington due to national security.

118
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:06,666
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just want to make sure that all the students know that they do have to buy insurance.

119
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,487
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was just wondering if, through you,

120
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:14,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Through you, Madam Mayor, to the representative of the company, what the cost of that trip insurance is.

121
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:23,338
[SPEAKER_06]: It was $155, and it was outlined for them, so it was mandatory for every student, so it's part of the total cost.

122
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:24,760
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to make sure they know up front that they...

123
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:28,530
[SPEAKER_16]: They do have to purchase insurance just in case something might happen.

124
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:28,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

125
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:28,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

126
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to take them out of the country without them getting the insurance.

127
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:32,092
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't an option for me.

128
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:32,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

129
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:32,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

130
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:33,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

131
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:33,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

132
00:08:33,233 --> 00:08:33,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Cuno.

133
00:08:33,493 --> 00:08:33,714
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

134
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:52,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank you.

135
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: The trip was very successful a couple of years ago.

136
00:08:55,418 --> 00:08:59,000
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard a lot from the students that participated and it was really nice to hear.

137
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:14,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe just a point of interest is that when we spoke about the trips, especially outside of the country or even within the country, I believe we had, as a school committee, had said that one of the mandatory things was to have insurance.

138
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:15,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

139
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:23,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the question is that to what point do the kids get a refund if anything does happen?

140
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:28,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Will the insurance kick into that or do you work with the insurance company to do that?

141
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,663
[SPEAKER_05]: All depends on the reason behind the cancellation.

142
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:38,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So our insurance, the $155, covers tour cancellation for medical reasons.

143
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,507
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if they were hospitalized and they received documentation that they couldn't travel.

144
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:47,909
[SPEAKER_05]: It also covers things such as if their parents were deployed or loses their employment.

145
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:56,872
[SPEAKER_05]: So as long as they're able to provide the documents that go in line with the insurance policy, then they will receive a refund within six weeks of their cancellation.

146
00:09:57,072 --> 00:09:57,712
[SPEAKER_04]: A full refund?

147
00:09:58,356 --> 00:10:06,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Minus the $95 initial deposit and the amount that they pay for the insurance, as long as they're canceling for reasons underneath the insurance policy.

148
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and what about if there is a situation, like unfortunately there was a situation because of...

149
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:13,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was the bottom line.

150
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:29,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that would be covered with our policy and it's actually a free policy on everybody's account and it basically states that if there's something going on in the world and you don't feel comfortable and confident with your decision to travel, you work with EF to come up with other arrangements.

151
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:30,366
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're able to.

152
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:32,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Viktoria, viktoria.com

153
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:08,852
[SPEAKER_04]: If you make the tweaks as needed, and let's say the majority of the students can go on the trip, but there happens to be one or two who cannot make that particular change of date or whatever the case may be, are they entitled to a refund?

154
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:10,454
[SPEAKER_05]: So we didn't do refunds.

155
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:19,621
[SPEAKER_05]: What we did was future travel vouchers, and what the schools did in that case is they were able to sell those to those individual students for future travel years.

156
00:11:20,322 --> 00:11:21,383
[SPEAKER_04]: What about if we have a senior?

157
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:29,287
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a future travel plan, like a voucher, so that they would be able to utilize it for the underclassmen.

158
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:46,344
[SPEAKER_05]: When changes are happening last minute, one main part of EF is that we want to make educational travel affordable and accessible to as many students as possible, so we really encourage planning early so that we can secure the best prices and pass those directly on to the students.

159
00:11:46,404 --> 00:11:52,807
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the event that there's cancellations last minute, we work really closely with the airlines to be able to provide an option.

160
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:54,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, giving a full refund,

161
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:58,149
[SPEAKER_05]: for a variety of different reasons is not an option.

162
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:09,991
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been able to secure these future travel vouchers, which has made school districts that we work with across not only Massachusetts, but the United States as a whole, happy in that sense.

163
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:10,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, thank you.

164
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:11,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

165
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:16,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just looking... Do we have a price?

166
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:17,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

167
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:19,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I not see it?

168
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:20,913
[SPEAKER_06]: The back, total trip cost.

169
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:31,852
[SPEAKER_06]: 2880.

170
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:31,852
[SPEAKER_06]: That's including the deposit and the insurance.

171
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:33,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, Paige.

172
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:33,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

173
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:35,573
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thank you.

174
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:37,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

175
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:38,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

176
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:42,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have an idea of how many students will be participating?

177
00:12:42,315 --> 00:12:43,795
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 20 registered students.

178
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:49,296
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, and did you open that up to the vocational and Curtis Tough students as well?

179
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:52,157
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, 20 students.

180
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,317
[SPEAKER_07]: And you'll have enough chaperones, I'm assuming?

181
00:12:55,635 --> 00:12:55,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

182
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,696
[SPEAKER_07]: And what grade levels?

183
00:12:58,716 --> 00:13:00,197
[SPEAKER_06]: They are grades 10 through 12.

184
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:02,318
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was open to anyone at the high school last year.

185
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:05,940
[SPEAKER_06]: 9th graders who are now 10th graders signed up.

186
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:13,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Some parents did have questions about middle schoolers coming, but we just kept it at the high schools, so they're in grades 10 through 12.

187
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:17,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think those are two different groups of different abilities.

188
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:22,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I was most comfortable with students being in the grades 10 through 12 range.

189
00:13:22,587 --> 00:13:22,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

190
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:23,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

191
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it sounds like a great trip.

192
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,952
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to know, I was looking on the website and some of the questions it said, you know, were to make sure you know where the embassy is.

193
00:13:37,307 --> 00:13:38,307
[SPEAKER_09]: where the hospital is.

194
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:42,249
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you know, are you close to these facilities?

195
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:42,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

196
00:13:42,749 --> 00:13:47,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So with all of our programs, we have a full-time EF field director that's with the group 24-7.

197
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only are they with them while they're on the program, but they're locals of the area.

198
00:13:51,632 --> 00:14:01,575
[SPEAKER_05]: And so whenever we are contracting out these NGOs and international charities that we partner with, we make sure that they're in close proximity to the nearest hospitals and clinics.

199
00:14:02,795 --> 00:14:04,896
[SPEAKER_09]: There was one other item I read.

200
00:14:05,397 --> 00:14:15,144
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if this is true, but it said that if somebody was going to be hospitalized, the hospital would only take cash and it might cost up to $100,000.

201
00:14:16,085 --> 00:14:21,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that the insurance that you're getting is only up to $35,000.

202
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:22,670
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wasn't sure.

203
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know, like I said, this is the internet.

204
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:33,378
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just googling information on how safe is traveling to the Dominican Republic.

205
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:39,399
[SPEAKER_09]: just different types of things you could click on.

206
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:44,222
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't sure if there was any factual information about that.

207
00:14:46,324 --> 00:15:01,635
[SPEAKER_05]: What we can do is submit the entire policy for the medical side of things, if that's what you're... I'm not sure what you cited, so I wouldn't be able to speak to that specifically, but we partnered with one company for our global travel protection plan, and we've been using them

208
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:08,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Vi har varit i en företag i 50 år, och vi har använt dem exklusivt, så de handlar ofta med våra studeringsgrupper.

209
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Vi är också en stor global företag, och om något sånt här kommer upp, så är vi där också.

210
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:16,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi kan aldrig förvänta oss att en studerende ska betala 100.000 dollar.

211
00:15:17,007 --> 00:15:20,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Ja, och jag vet inte om hospitalet bara accepterade kashen, eller om det inte var tillgängligt.

212
00:15:26,755 --> 00:15:30,917
[SPEAKER_05]: There's situations, you know, in the event that that came up, that's why we're there on the ground.

213
00:15:30,937 --> 00:15:44,985
[SPEAKER_05]: We would never put, you know, a student in a situation where they would, you know, in the event that they needed medical attention, the question would never be, do you take a credit card or cash and say, you see this student and we'll handle all of that on our end.

214
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:51,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And in Ecuador, I did have two students that had to go to a clinic and they didn't, no money came out of their pockets.

215
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:52,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It was covered.

216
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:52,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

217
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

218
00:15:55,817 --> 00:15:56,538
[SPEAKER_11]: Miss Van der Kloot.

219
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:57,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

220
00:15:58,179 --> 00:16:02,123
[SPEAKER_11]: First, Miss Glasser, thank you for organizing this and working with our students.

221
00:16:02,383 --> 00:16:03,424
[SPEAKER_11]: I do have a couple of questions.

222
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:09,050
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious whether it's a private charter airline or a regular airline.

223
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,550
[SPEAKER_05]: Regular.

224
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,971
[SPEAKER_05]: We use all the major airlines.

225
00:16:11,712 --> 00:16:12,333
[SPEAKER_11]: All the major ones.

226
00:16:13,394 --> 00:16:16,537
[SPEAKER_11]: Is the Zika virus an issue in the Dominican Republic?

227
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now there's a travel alert for Zika in all the Central and South America.

228
00:16:23,642 --> 00:16:31,024
[SPEAKER_05]: What we do do is, in the event that that moves to a warning, we would throw in our peace of mind policy, which would allow you to make those changes.

229
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:41,147
[SPEAKER_05]: What we've learned from following the CDC very carefully, there's no advisory about not traveling to the Dominican Republic or to Central America, unless you are pregnant.

230
00:16:41,947 --> 00:16:48,473
[SPEAKER_05]: in that case they say to speak with your healthcare provider and take extra precautions around where and when.

231
00:16:49,013 --> 00:16:51,555
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no advisory telling U.S.

232
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,437
[SPEAKER_05]: citizens not to travel to these countries.

233
00:16:54,758 --> 00:17:00,082
[SPEAKER_11]: My last question is, I'm just curious, it looks like you're going to be staying in the Central Mountain region at some point.

234
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are you staying?

235
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:04,726
[SPEAKER_11]: What sort of accommodations are the kids in?

236
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:04,987
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

237
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:09,170
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, if you wouldn't mind, I can grab, I brought some sample hotels because that's typically

238
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:14,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question that comes up at school committees, but I can tell you just quickly some of the things that we look for when we're contracting hotels.

239
00:17:15,457 --> 00:17:16,819
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, safety and security.

240
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:19,382
[SPEAKER_05]: That really is in the forefront of our mind with all of our programs.

241
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:21,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they willing to take student rooms?

242
00:17:21,825 --> 00:17:27,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Can they room three to four students per room, private rooms with private bathrooms?

243
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:34,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally went on this program two years ago with a team of educators and administrators from across Massachusetts.

244
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:38,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you, I stayed in all the same hotels that your groups will be staying in.

245
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,503
[SPEAKER_05]: And they really are wonderful hotels for students.

246
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:46,146
[SPEAKER_05]: We make sure that they are, obviously, as I mentioned before, in a safe area.

247
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:52,311
[SPEAKER_05]: And in an area where kids will have something to do after they come back from their service site.

248
00:17:52,331 --> 00:17:56,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll have a common room where they'll be able to do their reflection or some of the hotels may have

249
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:12,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, as you're doing that, I'll just mention that I also went on a service trip to the Dominican Republic about five, six years ago, and it was an incredible experience.

250
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:30,723
[SPEAKER_05]: To give Massachusetts as a whole kind of a little shout out is the reason why we created these service learning programs was really because of educators and administrators having the need and want for programs that would provide students with service and also leadership development.

251
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:37,268
[SPEAKER_05]: So EF as a whole, we've been in business for 50 years now and it was about 10 years ago that we put together an administrator around

252
00:18:38,108 --> 00:18:40,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Vi har en fokusgruppe som sagt, vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

253
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:41,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

254
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:42,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

255
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

256
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

257
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:44,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

258
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

259
00:18:45,611 --> 00:18:46,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

260
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:47,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

261
00:18:47,771 --> 00:18:49,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

262
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

263
00:18:50,392 --> 00:18:51,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

264
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:52,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

265
00:18:52,593 --> 00:18:53,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

266
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:54,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

267
00:18:54,294 --> 00:18:55,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

268
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

269
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:57,094
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

270
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:57,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om som företag?

271
00:18:58,035 --> 00:18:58,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Vad ska vi tänka om

272
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:17,233
[SPEAKER_05]: educational focused service learning, environmental and community development, where students can receive 5 hours up to 25 hours of service, which if your school has that built into your graduation requirement, they will receive a certificate after they get back outlining those hours of service that they received while on one of these programs.

273
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,565
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe there's a motion.

274
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:27,527
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second the motion.

275
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:28,607
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

276
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:29,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Cuno.

277
00:19:30,089 --> 00:19:33,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to go back to the safety part of it.

278
00:19:34,212 --> 00:19:37,014
[SPEAKER_04]: You said that there's a chaperone that comes from the area.

279
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:38,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they, he, she,

280
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:40,782
[SPEAKER_04]: stay at the hotel.

281
00:19:41,042 --> 00:19:41,522
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

282
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:49,864
[SPEAKER_05]: So they are with our field directors are local of the area and they are with the group 24 7 from the second they land at the airport to the second they go back to the airport to head back home.

283
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:53,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have the obviously the leadership chaperone team here.

284
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:57,606
[SPEAKER_05]: But in addition, you have this local expert who's with the group the entire time.

285
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:07,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's great because they're able to provide the local knowledge and insider perspective to all things related not only to service learning in the Dominican Republic, but the Dominican Republic as a whole.

286
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and on the peace of mind,

287
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:13,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, add the portion of that.

288
00:20:13,928 --> 00:20:18,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there an extra coverage by any chance monetary coverage on that as far as like?

289
00:20:18,598 --> 00:20:21,440
[SPEAKER_04]: As my colleague was saying, if God forbid someone has to go to the hospital.

290
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know if there's like extra coverage on that?

291
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:28,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So our peace of mind policy is different than our global travel protection plan.

292
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:42,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we have like a lot of different things that we throw out there, but our peace of mind policy is a free policy, basically on everybody's account, basically saying if there's something going on in the world and you don't feel comfortable and confident with your decision to travel, we'll work with you to tweak the arrangements.

293
00:20:43,338 --> 00:20:53,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Our Global Travel Protection Plan is more or less our travel insurance, so it's the medical and accidental, the baggage and property, tour cancellation and interruption, and flight delay.

294
00:20:53,785 --> 00:21:00,509
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is the 155 that all the students from Medford, actually, they have that already built into their program.

295
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,633
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a situation, but it had nothing to do with a group

296
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:16,455
[SPEAKER_04]: it was more a group of students after they graduated high school that did go down to have a nice time before college.

297
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:25,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, there was a situation where parents had to take their, well, the parents weren't there at that moment, but the child did have to go to the hospital.

298
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:29,198
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were a lot of different complications because of the language and things like that.

299
00:21:30,576 --> 00:21:41,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Vi är alltid säker på att det finns extra uppfyllelse och att det finns insuranser som är en del av det, men att vi vet att det finns en chaperone som är en del av det lokala, det är en stor del.

300
00:21:45,378 --> 00:21:51,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Det var från den agensy som de använde, eller gruppen som de använde, som faktiskt var där nere.

301
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Så jag tror att det är en bra del av det här.

302
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:57,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Och jag tror att det är därför vi fortsätter att se att skolor samarbetar med EF.

303
00:21:57,569 --> 00:22:03,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Vi är stolt över att vi kan offera de minsta priserna i industrin, men det är inte skälet till att folk fortsätter att resa med oss.

304
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Det är verkligen vår säkerhet och säkerhet bakom våra program.

305
00:22:06,296 --> 00:22:07,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Vi har en stor nätverd i världen.

306
00:22:07,478 --> 00:22:08,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

307
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

308
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:12,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

309
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:13,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

310
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:15,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

311
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:16,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

312
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:18,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

313
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:20,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

314
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 skolor och ofsikter med över 40.000 personer i världen.

315
00:22:22,337 --> 00:22:22,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Så vi har över 500 sk

316
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:48,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one really nice thing, my art tour director in Ecuador, she was with us the whole entire time, and she also knew the needs of the community, so at the end of the trip she asked the students, they all get EF backpacks, and she said, if there's anything you don't want to take back, you don't want to keep this backpack, if you have extra clothes you brought that you're not going to use, and a lot of the kids donated some of the things they brought with them, they're like, yeah, I don't need this, let me donate this, let me make some more room for souvenirs, so they got to give back in another way to the community.

317
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:56,450
[SPEAKER_05]: All the students will receive an EF backpack and that's a great idea actually about donating it.

318
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:02,074
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been with EF for 10 years now and I'm a product of traveling abroad at a young age.

319
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:07,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I had the opportunity to travel to Australia and New Zealand when I was in high school and it really formed me and molded me into who I am.

320
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:24,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I think allowing this program is obviously wonderful, but I do want to just highlight, as I said before, I did travel down to the Dominican Republic two years ago, and I was so inspired, and this has never happened in my ten years, that I tried to get a student group organized in my own community to go down to the Dominican Republic.

321
00:23:25,016 --> 00:23:31,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it was just what I saw and what I experienced and what I felt after I left just made me want to do more and be a better person.

322
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:47,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, you know, I'm really excited to see your students go, but also encourage them to come back and share with the school committee, as it seems like they did with Ecuador, to make you all part of this, because you're all, you know, doing your part in helping them see the world and become better global citizens.

323
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:48,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

324
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:49,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

325
00:23:49,329 --> 00:23:50,890
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the floor for approval.

326
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote, please, Mrs. Skerry.

327
00:23:59,928 --> 00:24:01,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, 6 in the affirmative, 1 absent.

328
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,730
[SPEAKER_08]: To approve the service learning trip to Dominican Republic.

329
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

330
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:07,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

331
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:16,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for suspension of the rules to report back on item 1, report on, I'm sorry, report on project 351.

332
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:28,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening everyone.

333
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:30,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for having me back.

334
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:40,910
[SPEAKER_13]: As you know, Project 351 is a community service project where representatives from the middle school meet with the 351 districts.

335
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:48,178
[SPEAKER_13]: It's done over the Martha Luther King weekend as well and they develop a service project

336
00:24:49,003 --> 00:24:50,344
[SPEAKER_13]: that comes back to the community.

337
00:24:50,384 --> 00:25:02,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And the process in picking an ambassador is opening it up to the school, getting teacher recommendations, and I'd like to introduce Marvin Michelle, who is going to be representing the Andrews Middle School this year for Project 351.

338
00:25:02,932 --> 00:25:10,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I just briefly want to read off what's said about Marvin, and you can definitely ask him any questions that you'd like.

339
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:16,941
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a great pleasure to announce that the Andrews had nominated Marvin Michelle to serve as our ambassador for Project 351.

340
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:20,514
[SPEAKER_13]: Marvin has been enrolled in the Andrews since the fall of 2013.

341
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:29,759
[SPEAKER_13]: He distinguished himself immediately as a person who was most filled with passion, enthusiasm, and excitement being a student at the Andrews Middle School.

342
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Our initial impression of him did not abate as the years progressed.

343
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:42,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Marvin has earned great respect from the faculty by being critically open-minded about expanding the parameters of the overall operation of school.

344
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:51,249
[SPEAKER_13]: He has a quality that makes him motivated and motivates others, and his dedication and accountability do not sway either way.

345
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,053
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been actively engaged in the community activities in which he's been involved in outreach and organizing.

346
00:25:57,133 --> 00:26:02,077
[SPEAKER_13]: These activities have allowed him to demonstrate and refine skills that will benefit any community.

347
00:26:02,838 --> 00:26:06,080
[SPEAKER_13]: Marvin is an optimistic person who finds solutions in times of crisis.

348
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:08,062
[SPEAKER_13]: His fellow students look for him for advice.

349
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:10,068
[SPEAKER_13]: But he's also fun to be around.

350
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:13,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Work gets done, but at the same time, new avenues of thinking are opened.

351
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,411
[SPEAKER_13]: He pursues the goals of his groups with passions without letting his own needs or interests get in the way.

352
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:24,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Marvin is an exceptional person who has earned the school recognition for commitment to others and his service to the community.

353
00:26:25,434 --> 00:26:33,657
[SPEAKER_13]: His cooperative spirit, his compassion for the well-being of all, and his flexible style make him an outstanding person who is destined for significant accomplishments.

354
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:36,218
[SPEAKER_13]: And everything that

355
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:40,089
[SPEAKER_13]: is said is definitely true about this gentleman that is next to me.

356
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:44,011
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm honored to have him represent the Andrews for Project 351.

357
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:46,812
[SPEAKER_13]: And ask him anything you'd like.

358
00:26:47,752 --> 00:26:49,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, Marvin.

359
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:50,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful job.

360
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:55,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also want to congratulate Josephine Rizzo, who was selected from the McGlynn Middle School as well.

361
00:26:56,095 --> 00:26:57,236
[SPEAKER_08]: But would you guys like a picture?

362
00:26:57,516 --> 00:26:58,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I take a picture of you two?

363
00:26:58,596 --> 00:26:58,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

364
00:26:58,936 --> 00:26:59,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that OK, Marvin?

365
00:26:59,757 --> 00:26:59,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

366
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:00,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Get close.

367
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:02,288
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

368
00:27:02,468 --> 00:27:03,008
[SPEAKER_13]: This is great.

369
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:07,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you tweet it and then I can retweet it and then we'll be... We got it.

370
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:13,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So Marvin, you make sure you come back and tell us all about it.

371
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:14,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

372
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:18,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, give us a report on your experience and we'll see you on MLK Day.

373
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,321
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be speaking on that day as well?

374
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:20,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

375
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:21,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

376
00:27:23,002 --> 00:27:23,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

377
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:23,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Cugno.

378
00:27:24,327 --> 00:27:31,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had the pleasure of participating in that day a few years back, and it was just a wonderful, wonderful day.

379
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:40,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait for you to come back and tell us all about it, because it's probably something that you're not expecting, because it wasn't what I was expecting of that day.

380
00:27:40,761 --> 00:27:49,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And to see the amount of students that are there, and to see the students that represent not only us, but really cities and towns across the state of Massachusetts, and to work together

381
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,265
[SPEAKER_04]: for such a wonderful cause.

382
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:56,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Very proud of you and for the other student, Josephine.

383
00:27:57,088 --> 00:28:00,749
[SPEAKER_04]: But really looking forward for you to come back and share what you did that day with us.

384
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:01,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

385
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:04,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

386
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:07,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

387
00:28:08,032 --> 00:28:10,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to receive and place on file this report.

388
00:28:11,153 --> 00:28:13,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

389
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:13,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz.

390
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:14,655
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

391
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:14,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

392
00:28:15,255 --> 00:28:15,895
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

393
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:16,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

394
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:19,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on Veterans Day program.

395
00:28:20,393 --> 00:28:28,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, we'll call upon our Director of Humanities, Dr. Kieser, and our Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccadeli, to tell us about Veterans Day.

396
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

397
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

398
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:47,524
[SPEAKER_01]: To commemorate Veterans Day, the Humanities Department and the Office of the Veterans Services worked collaboratively together to sponsor the Veterans Speaker Program.

399
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:48,605
[SPEAKER_01]: In its 16th year,

400
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:54,950
[SPEAKER_01]: The program provides all of our high school students with the opportunity to interact with veterans.

401
00:28:55,511 --> 00:29:06,138
[SPEAKER_01]: The veterans visit the classrooms to discuss their combat and non-combat experiences, and the program is enormously rewarding for the faculty, the veterans, and the students.

402
00:29:06,898 --> 00:29:11,301
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, our Veterans Day speaking program took place on Thursday, November 10th.

403
00:29:11,841 --> 00:29:18,826
[SPEAKER_01]: It was co-coordinated by Director of Veterans Services, Ernest Lindsey, myself, and our lead social studies teacher, Nicholas Kane.

404
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,713
[SPEAKER_01]: The day began at 7.30 in the morning in the superintendent's conference room.

405
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:29,176
[SPEAKER_01]: We had donuts and coffee that was generously donated by Dunkin' Donuts in West Medford.

406
00:29:30,037 --> 00:29:34,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had sandwiches and various salads for the veterans provided by food services.

407
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:44,567
[SPEAKER_01]: As a special touch this year, we had Noah Kreatz, a junior student at the Medford Vocational Technical School, organize his exhibit of war memorabilia.

408
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:49,311
[SPEAKER_01]: He had helmets, uniforms, and newspapers with headlines of World War I and World War II.

409
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:53,146
[SPEAKER_01]: And the veterans very much enjoyed seeing this.

410
00:29:53,266 --> 00:29:55,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very special touch to our program.

411
00:29:56,607 --> 00:30:00,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the day, we had 16 veterans this year visit over 45 classrooms.

412
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:07,970
[SPEAKER_01]: They were able to discuss their time within their combat and non-combat experiences.

413
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,071
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a wonderful experience for the students.

414
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:17,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of our veterans are graduates of the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical School.

415
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,293
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of them have come for years.

416
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:25,431
[SPEAKER_01]: and they selflessly donate their day off from work often, and we're very grateful to them for that.

417
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:33,696
[SPEAKER_01]: This year's program really provided students with an authentic experience for the opportunity to learn more about what they're studying in school.

418
00:30:37,178 --> 00:30:45,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and I failed to mention that Mayor Burke and school committee crets were able to come and see some of the presentations.

419
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:48,325
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to watch many of the presentations this year, too,

420
00:30:48,788 --> 00:30:50,208
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very touching and very moving.

421
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:51,069
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a great day.

422
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:56,970
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to sit in on acting Sergeant Charlie Hutnett of the Medford Police Department's presentation.

423
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,090
[SPEAKER_08]: He did a fabulous job.

424
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,591
[SPEAKER_08]: The kids were engaged and he had a slideshow, a PowerPoint going on.

425
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:06,132
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very interesting and a lot of good questions from the students.

426
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:06,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

427
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:08,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

428
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:08,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz.

429
00:31:09,973 --> 00:31:10,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

430
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:12,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you everybody for the program.

431
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:13,854
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a great program.

432
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:17,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I enjoyed it and Noah just wanted to say he really enjoyed it.

433
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,624
[SPEAKER_09]: looks forward to doing next year's program.

434
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:20,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good.

435
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:20,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

436
00:31:20,885 --> 00:31:25,429
[SPEAKER_09]: We want him back, so.

437
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:26,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto?

438
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:31,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Through you, Madam Mayor Burke, to the superintendent.

439
00:31:32,937 --> 00:31:35,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Belson, can we send a letter to all the veterans and

440
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:37,678
[SPEAKER_07]: with our appreciation.

441
00:31:38,018 --> 00:31:46,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

442
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:47,583
[SPEAKER_08]: They've already gone out.

443
00:31:47,663 --> 00:31:48,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe last.

444
00:31:48,343 --> 00:31:49,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do.

445
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:50,765
[SPEAKER_01]: And the class is right.

446
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:56,988
[SPEAKER_01]: The thank you notes, which is even more special to the veterans because they kind of in those 56 minutes, they really

447
00:31:57,352 --> 00:31:58,913
[SPEAKER_01]: develop a nice rapport with the students.

448
00:31:58,953 --> 00:32:01,295
[SPEAKER_01]: So the students enjoy writing it as well.

449
00:32:01,315 --> 00:32:02,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely, we do do that.

450
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:03,296
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

451
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:03,936
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

452
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:10,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had the pleasure of meeting a gentleman who stormed the beach at Normandy this Veterans Day.

453
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And boy, it's amazing some of the stories that these people have.

454
00:32:14,803 --> 00:32:16,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very grateful for the years of service.

455
00:32:16,745 --> 00:32:20,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm very grateful that they share their experiences with our children.

456
00:32:21,227 --> 00:32:26,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you please tell Mr. Kane how happy we are that he and you run Anne Bernadette?

457
00:32:27,156 --> 00:32:28,976
[SPEAKER_07]: run such a great program for our students.

458
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:29,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

459
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:34,098
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ernest Lindsay, he did a fabulous job as well, so I'll send along the thank yous.

460
00:32:34,138 --> 00:32:42,360
[SPEAKER_07]: That interactive learning and learning across age is really something that kids, students remember forever.

461
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,460
[SPEAKER_01]: It was wonderful.

462
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,260
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great day.

463
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:46,141
[SPEAKER_01]: As it always is, but it was wonderful.

464
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:46,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

465
00:32:46,361 --> 00:32:47,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for your work on this.

466
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:48,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

467
00:32:48,922 --> 00:32:49,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

468
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:49,642
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

469
00:32:50,122 --> 00:32:53,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I was just thinking, I remember Charlie when he was in high school.

470
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:56,014
[SPEAKER_11]: and I remember him at the pep rally.

471
00:32:56,354 --> 00:33:03,359
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's so nice to have seen how he's grown and matured and now is giving back to our community in so many ways.

472
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,861
[SPEAKER_11]: There's something very special about it.

473
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:19,710
[SPEAKER_11]: I also just want to mention that while I was not able to attend, I know about Noah's interest in World War II memorabilia, and it's truly phenomenal, and so I'm really appreciative to him, son of school committee member.

474
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:26,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Cathy Kreatz, that he is sharing that with people and I just think that's fantastic.

475
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:33,836
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very powerful as the veterans were coming out to actually see the memorabilia and just to watch their eyes and see the reaction.

476
00:33:34,356 --> 00:33:38,258
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a very special touch to the day, which is always a great day.

477
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:39,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

478
00:33:40,027 --> 00:33:40,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

479
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:41,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

480
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:44,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Miss Van der Kloot to receive in place on file this paper.

481
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:45,969
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

482
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,470
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

483
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

484
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendation to approve reasonable use policy.

485
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:52,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

486
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:54,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Members of the committee.

487
00:33:55,613 --> 00:34:02,455
[SPEAKER_14]: The advance of technology requires that we improve our policy with regard to use of technology.

488
00:34:03,424 --> 00:34:15,056
[SPEAKER_14]: The current policy is attached to the cover page, it's called the acceptable use policy, but it's much thinner than the one that we have developed since that time.

489
00:34:15,877 --> 00:34:22,924
[SPEAKER_14]: However, tonight we have Mr. Trotter and Mr. Arena with us who work on our technology.

490
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:25,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Alan is the network administrator, Richard is the

491
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:27,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Director of Media and Technology.

492
00:34:28,038 --> 00:34:35,186
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'd like to table it tonight because some additional information has come to our attention from the ACLU and some other groups.

493
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:43,596
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to match up the information to make sure that we've covered all the bases and make sure that there's nothing that we've missed.

494
00:34:45,075 --> 00:34:47,758
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to be careful that different groups have different issues.

495
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:52,224
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some other things that are moving forward, but we do want to address this as an issue.

496
00:34:52,264 --> 00:35:01,976
[SPEAKER_14]: So, what you have in front of you, look it over and give us any feedback you have, and we will continue to research some of the latest stuff that's come out only this past week.

497
00:35:02,813 --> 00:35:08,896
[SPEAKER_14]: and determine whether or not we've missed anything that we think should be included or something that should be worded differently.

498
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:15,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Trotter and Mr. Arena are here if you have any preliminary questions, otherwise we recommend we lay it on the table.

499
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Ms.

500
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz to lay this paper on the table until our next school committee meeting, seconded by Ms.

501
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:22,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno.

502
00:35:23,304 --> 00:35:24,064
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

503
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:25,465
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

504
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:26,285
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion passes.

505
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:29,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you both for coming.

506
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,441
[SPEAKER_08]: report on joint M.A.S.C.

507
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:35,221
[SPEAKER_08]: M.A.S.S.

508
00:35:35,281 --> 00:35:36,802
[SPEAKER_08]: conference, Mr. Superintendent.

509
00:35:36,982 --> 00:35:42,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, the conference was great, but our deputy superintendent is going to issue this report to you.

510
00:35:42,965 --> 00:35:48,647
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of attachments, and you'll find at the back there's also a financial accounting that was asked for at a previous meeting.

511
00:35:49,168 --> 00:35:49,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

512
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:49,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Nelson.

513
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:51,869
[SPEAKER_10]: The M.A.S.C.

514
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:52,409
[SPEAKER_10]: M.A.S.S.

515
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:58,192
[SPEAKER_10]: conference that's held annually was held this year in Hyannis from November 2nd to the 5th.

516
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:06,709
[SPEAKER_10]: There were a variety, a large variety of workshops that took place that focused on important current topics in education.

517
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:16,214
[SPEAKER_10]: School committee members, Paulette Van der Kloot, Robert Scarry, and Anne-Marie Cugno, attended various segments of the three-day conference.

518
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:22,598
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent Bellison, Assistant Superintendent Caldwell, and myself also were in attendance.

519
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:26,300
[SPEAKER_10]: What we try to do at these conferences, because as you can see from the

520
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:28,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Full agenda I gave you.

521
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:29,887
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of things going on simultaneously.

522
00:36:30,427 --> 00:36:38,972
[SPEAKER_10]: We try to divide and conquer, so we kind of make a plan where we attend different things and come back together and share as much information as possible.

523
00:36:39,172 --> 00:36:40,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Makes it more efficient.

524
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:43,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the highlights from the workshop.

525
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:48,158
[SPEAKER_10]: There was a section or segment, a workshop on the new MCAS 2.0.

526
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,900
[SPEAKER_10]: We learned some new things about it.

527
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,702
[SPEAKER_10]: It's being called the next generation MCAS.

528
00:36:55,582 --> 00:37:00,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it will be administered to all students this year, grades three through eight.

529
00:37:01,706 --> 00:37:09,452
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that they are moving more and more towards total computer-based testing, as each year it's going to accelerate.

530
00:37:09,492 --> 00:37:17,478
[SPEAKER_10]: This year, as you know, we are asked to test online, test by computer, the students in grades four and eight.

531
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:20,200
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that Andrews is going to do all the grade levels.

532
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,981
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the subsequent year,

533
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:25,496
[SPEAKER_10]: the different groups, the different grades increase.

534
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:32,802
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is in the PowerPoint slides that I've attached from Jeff Wilson, who's deputy commissioner for DESE.

535
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,364
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very ambitious, I think, program.

536
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:43,169
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, all, everyone should be testing on computers, all the different subjects and all the different grade levels by 2019.

537
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:45,431
[SPEAKER_10]: That's their ambitious goal.

538
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:48,373
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to score using four levels.

539
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:51,475
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the old advanced, proficient, needs improvement and warning.

540
00:37:52,347 --> 00:38:01,374
[SPEAKER_10]: We understand from that meeting it's partially meeting expectations, not yet meeting expectations, meeting expectations and exceeding expectations.

541
00:38:01,454 --> 00:38:03,255
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what we've been told.

542
00:38:03,895 --> 00:38:08,699
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that we did learn is there's still a lot of questions to be answered.

543
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,224
[SPEAKER_10]: So for example, are they going to test the same science subjects at the high school?

544
00:38:15,244 --> 00:38:15,904
[SPEAKER_10]: They weren't sure.

545
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:19,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they going to add a social studies test?

546
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:24,085
[SPEAKER_10]: to the MCAS cohort of testing, they're not sure.

547
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:33,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they're also saying, should we move the high school competency determination, the graduation requirement, and move that to a grade 11 test?

548
00:38:34,432 --> 00:38:36,194
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was still a lot of questions.

549
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:47,682
[SPEAKER_10]: There were many people from the western part of the state that really were quite upset with the ambitious rate of accelerating this computer-based testing because

550
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:50,883
[SPEAKER_10]: They were saying that they don't have the infrastructure.

551
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:56,026
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to get there, but we're well ahead of those communities.

552
00:38:56,766 --> 00:39:02,990
[SPEAKER_10]: They told us stories that sometimes kids are sitting outside the library in snowstorms trying to access the Wi-Fi.

553
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:08,113
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, how they're going to bring everybody in the state to this level so quickly remains to be seen.

554
00:39:10,275 --> 00:39:16,879
[SPEAKER_10]: Other workshops, again, as Mr. Skerry pointed out, the focus of the conference was social-emotional.

555
00:39:17,668 --> 00:39:20,990
[SPEAKER_10]: och vi satt i sessioner som handlade om det.

556
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:27,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Sheila Dennery som arbetar med Children's Hospital och Boston Public School har diskuterat sin job med lärare.

557
00:39:27,754 --> 00:39:34,679
[SPEAKER_10]: En av de saker som är väldigt intressant är att i dagens lärarutveckling har det egentligen inget på social-emotional.

558
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:44,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Så läraren går in i klassrumer där de kan ha en hel del utveckling och behandlingsmanagement och andra pedagogik, men väldigt, väldigt lite på social-emotional och de försöker att vända det.

559
00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:52,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Sheila is working with Boston teachers in providing PD for the teachers on how to deal with students in the classes.

560
00:39:52,978 --> 00:40:06,723
[SPEAKER_10]: One thing I felt that was really encouraging is they're putting together an online program called TAP that we'll all have access to down the road so we can actually plug our teachers into this online training and so they'll have the benefit of it as well.

561
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:08,503
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a very interesting session.

562
00:40:09,663 --> 00:40:14,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Jessica Minahan is always very interesting and she has a wealth of very practical

563
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,722
[SPEAKER_10]: suggestions for dealing with students who are having issues in the classroom.

564
00:40:19,742 --> 00:40:20,863
[SPEAKER_10]: She's written several books.

565
00:40:21,403 --> 00:40:26,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Her PowerPoint slides are attached as well to the report.

566
00:40:28,186 --> 00:40:36,349
[SPEAKER_10]: Many sessions dealt with legal updates as well as some of the issues that schools are currently dealing with.

567
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:42,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, we had the opportunity to meet with many vendors.

568
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:44,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of them we already are

569
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:53,915
[SPEAKER_10]: working with, School Brains was there, we had an opportunity to talk with them and there's one issue that I wanted to resolve and they were very attentive to that.

570
00:40:54,956 --> 00:41:06,302
[SPEAKER_10]: We also, the superintendent talked with people on technology and the idea that there's additional funding that we might be able to tap into, so that was very beneficial.

571
00:41:07,443 --> 00:41:13,346
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, some of the other vendors, I won't go through all of them, but again, there's a great

572
00:41:14,082 --> 00:41:19,065
[SPEAKER_10]: information that can be gleaned just by visiting the different booths at the conference.

573
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:25,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I've attached again the full agenda for the conference.

574
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:27,209
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see all the various workshops.

575
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:41,997
[SPEAKER_10]: The slides from the MCAS 2.0, slides from Jessica Minahan's presentation, and I think the superintendent, you've attached some additional things as well.

576
00:41:42,613 --> 00:41:44,950
[SPEAKER_10]: So if anyone has any questions that I can answer.

577
00:41:46,008 --> 00:41:46,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Muchas gracias.

578
00:41:46,808 --> 00:41:47,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Muy bien.

579
00:41:47,209 --> 00:41:47,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

580
00:41:47,269 --> 00:41:47,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuno.

581
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:48,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

582
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have questions.

583
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:57,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, I guess on the record, as usual, I'm frustrated with the, you know, the new next generation MCAS.

584
00:41:59,133 --> 00:42:04,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to be on record that, again, it's frustrating because there are never any answers.

585
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:07,117
[SPEAKER_04]: They just kind of always put the cart before the horse.

586
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:11,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to make sure that our students are not the ones that are caught in that.

587
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:24,684
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important that they do recognize and that they do see that they have to grandfather students in to certain places before they go ahead and just change everything because it's not fair.

588
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:26,825
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fair to our students that are graduating.

589
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:33,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know I brought this up a few years ago when they were talking about PARCC because they came and they spoke about it.

590
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:36,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, they had no answers to the questions.

591
00:42:38,269 --> 00:42:40,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on the board of DESC.

592
00:42:41,458 --> 00:43:05,359
[SPEAKER_04]: working with the park and again they had no they didn't have any answers so my concern is always and I'm sure it's not just mine but my colleagues and everyone here is when they are changing everything around to make sure that at least we incorporate the students that are already taking the ones that they're taking and not incorporate them into something that our kids will not have a chance in passing.

593
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Well the high school test the grade 10 will remain

594
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,582
[SPEAKER_10]: what they call the legacy MCAS, which is the old MCAS.

595
00:43:12,143 --> 00:43:20,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, through, you know, the year 2002, 2021 will be the first cohort of students.

596
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:25,033
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are our eighth graders now that will have to take the next generation for competency determination.

597
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:34,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And the feeling was that we'll give these kids in the grade eight, because they don't take the test in grade nine, an opportunity to at least experience the test before they have to take it for real.

598
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,481
[SPEAKER_10]: So again,

599
00:43:35,952 --> 00:43:44,735
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a fast pace and this is the only time I can remember that we have put in place a test that hasn't been piloted for a couple of years.

600
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:47,816
[SPEAKER_10]: The original MCAS test, it was piloted for two or three years.

601
00:43:48,296 --> 00:43:50,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're just saying here it is and they don't even have worked out.

602
00:43:51,417 --> 00:43:54,418
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a problem with some of the categories that they're going to rate the kids.

603
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:56,419
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that mean exactly?

604
00:43:57,499 --> 00:44:01,521
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, meeting expectations versus not yet meeting.

605
00:44:01,861 --> 00:44:03,462
[SPEAKER_10]: How many do they not have to meet?

606
00:44:03,522 --> 00:44:04,682
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very vague still.

607
00:44:05,464 --> 00:44:10,948
[SPEAKER_10]: And for them to be going this quickly and putting this in place, we have to just see what happens.

608
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:14,511
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to advise that we have a large, a long window for testing.

609
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:21,577
[SPEAKER_10]: The English can be pretty much all take place all during the month of April and the math during May.

610
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:27,742
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to suggest that when we schedule these tests, we don't schedule it for the first week in April.

611
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:31,805
[SPEAKER_10]: We wait and see what's happening around the Commonwealth to see if there are some problems.

612
00:44:32,345 --> 00:44:34,527
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll schedule like it's starting the second week in April.

613
00:44:35,482 --> 00:44:36,263
[SPEAKER_10]: The same with the math.

614
00:44:36,904 --> 00:44:45,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other thing that they need to, I mean, again, this is something that I've spoken about the last few years is that they come out and they keep on saying that this is great.

615
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:48,253
[SPEAKER_04]: All our students are going to take this exam online.

616
00:44:48,774 --> 00:44:50,495
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be great for our administrators.

617
00:44:50,615 --> 00:44:52,837
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get the test scores back.

618
00:44:53,558 --> 00:44:58,662
[SPEAKER_04]: But no one's come up with a solution of how we're going to handle that because the budget line

619
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:15,462
[SPEAKER_04]: for technology is huge and it's huge across this whole state and not only the state but it's going to be across the nation and so they really need to start working on what they're going to do to cover this because the way I feel about it I said it a few years back is that I basically feel

620
00:45:16,002 --> 00:45:40,415
[SPEAKER_04]: that if we don't have the proper technology, and honestly, I know I'm going to get a lot of feedback from this, is that I'm not saying that our technology is the best, but when you do go to a conference like that, or you go to a national conference and you hear the stories that we hear, and they're saying we're going to implement this across the board, it's something that they really need to start thinking about, because technology, I mean, look at your own homes.

621
00:45:41,095 --> 00:45:43,696
[SPEAKER_04]: or where you work if you're working outside of the school system.

622
00:45:44,217 --> 00:45:46,057
[SPEAKER_04]: It's constantly, constantly changing.

623
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:50,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just don't want to see our children, again, being set up to fail.

624
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:55,742
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like, you know, giving them a piece of paper and saying, here you go, you can take a test, but oops, I'm not going to give you the pencil.

625
00:45:56,342 --> 00:45:58,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's almost like the technology.

626
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:05,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I will be, I will say it again that I'm very happy about how we're doing our technology in our city.

627
00:46:05,406 --> 00:46:13,309
[SPEAKER_04]: We've tried to be as advocate and advanced as possible, but it's impossible sometimes to keep up because we're talking about a lot of money.

628
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:24,014
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, they keep on saying, I know last, was it last year or the year before, maybe through you to the superintendent, maybe, that the governor had given us was like a hundred,

629
00:46:25,127 --> 00:46:26,728
[SPEAKER_04]: million dollars or something like that.

630
00:46:26,808 --> 00:46:28,629
[SPEAKER_04]: But it sounds like a lot of money.

631
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:34,293
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're dividing it up throughout the whole state, I mean, it ended up being what, like $10,000 or something, if that.

632
00:46:34,814 --> 00:46:40,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is what we need to advocate ourselves as a committee and let others know.

633
00:46:41,218 --> 00:46:44,820
[SPEAKER_10]: We are being very proactive in planning for this.

634
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:52,565
[SPEAKER_10]: We visited, a group of us visited the Burlington Public Schools, which have been kind of trying to do the online stuff early on.

635
00:46:52,826 --> 00:46:54,767
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've learned a lot of tips.

636
00:46:55,472 --> 00:46:57,753
[SPEAKER_10]: as to things that worked and things that didn't work.

637
00:46:57,793 --> 00:47:04,216
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're trying to be very proactive in getting as much information as possible as we move into this.

638
00:47:05,597 --> 00:47:05,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

639
00:47:06,797 --> 00:47:07,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

640
00:47:08,018 --> 00:47:08,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

641
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:09,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your report.

642
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:11,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I really appreciate it.

643
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:22,124
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like there was a lot of great topics in here, and I saw some that, you know, that Kathy Medaglio, the Director of Special Education, might benefit from learning from.

644
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:23,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering how that

645
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:28,442
[SPEAKER_07]: How the information from this conference gets to our department heads?

646
00:47:29,242 --> 00:47:30,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that through you?

647
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:31,903
[SPEAKER_10]: At our meetings.

648
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:34,584
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't had our meeting.

649
00:47:34,604 --> 00:47:39,346
[SPEAKER_10]: We have our next administrative meeting on December 6th.

650
00:47:39,386 --> 00:47:42,267
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we do, things that are most urgent.

651
00:47:42,287 --> 00:47:46,969
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, some of the MCAS stuff is already out because that was important to get a jump on that.

652
00:47:47,549 --> 00:47:52,231
[SPEAKER_10]: But what we usually do is we share this information at the next administrative meeting.

653
00:47:52,820 --> 00:48:03,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathy, we see every Monday morning, if there's anything critical, there were a lot of workshops around special education, the safe school issues, gay, lesbian, the gender issues.

654
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:06,810
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a huge topic as well.

655
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:13,875
[SPEAKER_10]: So it all gets disseminated more quickly to those who are directly involved, but eventually to all the administrative staff.

656
00:48:15,203 --> 00:48:21,509
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm pushy and I ask for this report and I also ask how much we pay on this conference.

657
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:24,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I also have great respect for it for one reason.

658
00:48:24,772 --> 00:48:34,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that a lot of the money that came into our school department for our science labs came from your team attendance.

659
00:48:35,617 --> 00:48:45,161
[SPEAKER_07]: at the conference, because Mr. Belson came back from one of the conference with this idea and about the grant, and he was on fire to make sure that that happened.

660
00:48:45,241 --> 00:48:47,742
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that we have our science labs because of it.

661
00:48:48,162 --> 00:49:01,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do see value in it, but also as my job, I need to make sure that we're using funds appropriately, and that's why I always ask how much we pay for it, how many people are going, is it of value,

662
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:03,999
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the money actually paying for?

663
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:05,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Are the right people going?

664
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:11,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that we're just straight out and honest and communicate.

665
00:49:11,303 --> 00:49:16,326
[SPEAKER_07]: We do pay, we do spend $3,500 to send people to this conference.

666
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:23,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And I trust in the administrative team's judgment that this is necessary and helpful for our district.

667
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:28,173
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do believe that the $13 or $14 million we spent on our labs,

668
00:49:30,898 --> 00:49:35,121
[SPEAKER_07]: som var 60 procent funderad av federal government, var på grund av den här konferensen.

669
00:49:35,202 --> 00:49:37,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct, Mr. Belson?

670
00:49:37,063 --> 00:49:37,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

671
00:49:37,844 --> 00:49:39,065
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you bring back this year?

672
00:49:39,085 --> 00:49:39,785
[SPEAKER_07]: What are the big things?

673
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:51,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, one of the things that, you know, was in here that you should notice is the fact that we've identified through tier 2 of the E-rate about 700,000, it could be as much as 800,000 that we can access.

674
00:49:51,775 --> 00:49:54,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll start applying for that after the first year when the window opens.

675
00:49:55,438 --> 00:49:56,239
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a match.

676
00:49:56,759 --> 00:49:58,881
[SPEAKER_14]: That's 60 percent of the cost of what we pay.

677
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:00,102
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do our capital plan

678
00:50:00,837 --> 00:50:09,243
[SPEAKER_14]: We can hope to get as much as $800,000 against the capital plan for technology enhancements, which will be well worth the thing.

679
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:13,645
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's a couple of other technology items in here that also are fundable.

680
00:50:14,286 --> 00:50:16,907
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was probably the biggest financial takeaway.

681
00:50:17,468 --> 00:50:18,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing was to look at roofing.

682
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:24,893
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I mentioned it here a little bit, because obviously we're looking at roofing going down the future.

683
00:50:25,493 --> 00:50:27,795
[SPEAKER_14]: And some of the roofing applications now are

684
00:50:28,678 --> 00:50:34,199
[SPEAKER_14]: very, very good and they're less expensive than some of the previous roofing and they can be done much more quickly.

685
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:37,500
[SPEAKER_14]: So becoming familiar with that is a real important thing.

686
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,201
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some legal things that are coming up that are really questionable that we need to get in front of.

687
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:55,163
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that we just had an election and that with that election, ESSA is going to be looked at by a new administration, how it's going to be implemented, how it's going to be changed.

688
00:50:55,965 --> 00:50:58,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of those things were talked about in great length.

689
00:50:58,787 --> 00:51:00,127
[SPEAKER_14]: There were things that are still unknown.

690
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:04,689
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we just can't know, but people are speculating on them.

691
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:10,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think there's a lot of takeaways from this that you just can't do when you're not talking to people face to face.

692
00:51:10,732 --> 00:51:14,014
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're talking to somebody over the telephone, the conversations, they're good, but they're not great.

693
00:51:14,614 --> 00:51:21,298
[SPEAKER_14]: When you're talking to somebody face to face over a cup of coffee, you can get an awful lot of information, especially if they're working on this on a regular basis.

694
00:51:22,558 --> 00:51:22,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

695
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:23,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

696
00:51:24,737 --> 00:51:33,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the report.

697
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:36,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to know about the MCAS.

698
00:51:37,443 --> 00:51:41,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there any discussions about rolling it out to the schools?

699
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:46,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Any plans on how they're going to handle it where it's really not determined?

700
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:52,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any workshop sessions for students to get them acclimated?

701
00:51:53,573 --> 00:51:56,855
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it just seems like, you know, we don't know what it's going to be like, you know.

702
00:51:56,996 --> 00:52:00,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, our directors are on top of this.

703
00:52:00,558 --> 00:52:06,122
[SPEAKER_10]: We know the types of questions will be pretty much park-like questions.

704
00:52:06,763 --> 00:52:15,409
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we have already, I know that Dr. Chiesa and Mrs. Joy have put out some practice materials for teachers.

705
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:23,015
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, Jeff Wilson, the deputy commissioner, mentioned that there will be some practice tests coming out.

706
00:52:23,762 --> 00:52:25,103
[SPEAKER_10]: But they better get them out quickly.

707
00:52:27,044 --> 00:52:32,987
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, there are still some unknowns, but I think we have a good handle.

708
00:52:33,027 --> 00:52:34,368
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not just sitting by waiting.

709
00:52:34,908 --> 00:52:36,148
[SPEAKER_10]: We're out there trying to work.

710
00:52:36,188 --> 00:52:43,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also, one of the other important pieces to this is that our technology curriculum.

711
00:52:44,193 --> 00:52:50,596
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to make sure that teachers who are teaching the technology are teaching the kids the skills they need to

712
00:52:51,224 --> 00:53:00,532
[SPEAKER_10]: To be successful, we found from Burlington experiences and other communities that many children who took the online testing simply didn't know how to use the tools.

713
00:53:00,992 --> 00:53:07,798
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to make sure that they're not going to be graded down because they can't use the computer itself.

714
00:53:08,258 --> 00:53:15,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're working with the technology department to make sure that the skills they need, they practice ahead of time.

715
00:53:18,174 --> 00:53:29,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you also think that, because I know sometimes parents will ask or they wonder if more time is spent doing MCAS than on regular education and curriculum.

716
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:46,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think, you know, with the testing that's going to go on like mostly in April and May, you know, will it be more extensive and will there be, will it be, you know, stressful for the students with the regular coursework and the MCAS and the

717
00:53:48,652 --> 00:53:49,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just curious, you know.

718
00:53:50,213 --> 00:53:51,494
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we're going to try to contain it.

719
00:53:51,794 --> 00:54:01,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, when we do our meetings next month, we're going to recommend that the principals try to contain it in as few sessions as possible.

720
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:04,943
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think it's going to be any more at the grade levels three through eight.

721
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:14,970
[SPEAKER_10]: What I'm concerned about is down the road with the high school, because if we had gone with the park, which was an option, it would have been an 11th grade test, but that test was designed

722
00:54:15,498 --> 00:54:18,440
[SPEAKER_10]: to determine if kids were college ready.

723
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:30,107
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we had gone the park route and taken that assessment at grade 8, grade 11, then those youngsters, many of them would have to take the ACCUPLACER, which is the placement test for the state colleges.

724
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:41,153
[SPEAKER_10]: But now they're talking about, Jeff Wilson was talking about having a 10th grade test, which would be the competency determination test, and then having this 11th grade test as an additional one.

725
00:54:41,193 --> 00:54:43,855
[SPEAKER_10]: That bothers me because so many of the kids who

726
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we don't have a lot of kids who don't pass in 10th grade, but they've got to take the retest as juniors.

727
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:59,657
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other thing, too, if they move the whole test in high school to grade 11, that's problematic, too, because if a student doesn't pass in grade 11, they have a very limited opportunity to retest.

728
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:07,721
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if a student doesn't pass in grade 10, they have two opportunities in grade 11 and two opportunities in grade 12 before graduation.

729
00:55:08,241 --> 00:55:11,983
[SPEAKER_10]: But if we test in grade 11, they're only going to have two opportunities in grade 12.

730
00:55:13,739 --> 00:55:19,301
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, the high school testing is problematic and how they're going to do the science down the road.

731
00:55:19,341 --> 00:55:21,621
[SPEAKER_10]: They may not have a chemistry option.

732
00:55:21,941 --> 00:55:24,602
[SPEAKER_10]: It might just be introductory physics and biology.

733
00:55:25,362 --> 00:55:28,963
[SPEAKER_10]: But these decisions haven't been made, so we can only speculate.

734
00:55:30,563 --> 00:55:31,604
[SPEAKER_10]: It frustrates me, too.

735
00:55:31,644 --> 00:55:34,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not knowing the answers, but thank you.

736
00:55:35,104 --> 00:55:36,805
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to be proactive.

737
00:55:36,825 --> 00:55:41,526
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to visit other communities, see what the problems are computer-wise.

738
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:48,776
[SPEAKER_10]: technology wise, and then our directors are pretty savvy with the content, and they've been working with teachers on that.

739
00:55:50,437 --> 00:55:50,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

740
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:52,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

741
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:52,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

742
00:55:54,441 --> 00:55:57,423
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, I was at the conference and spent quite a bit of time there.

743
00:55:57,944 --> 00:56:07,452
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the only thing which was unfortunate was that more members of the committee were not able to come this year, because it's not only about talking about the

744
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:14,330
[SPEAKER_11]: The issues at hand are attending the different conference sessions.

745
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:21,202
[SPEAKER_11]: It's also about networking, talking to other school committee members, talking, giving, having a chance to talk about issues.

746
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,595
[SPEAKER_11]: with your colleagues while you're there.

747
00:56:24,897 --> 00:56:40,276
[SPEAKER_11]: It's difficult because for me it was three days off from my own job, but it is really worthwhile in the long run and I hope that next year that more people will be able to attend.

748
00:56:40,757 --> 00:56:41,037
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

749
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Miss Cugno.

750
00:56:46,812 --> 00:56:48,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely agree with my colleague.

751
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:50,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for all the reports and everything that you brought.

752
00:56:51,315 --> 00:57:03,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have the opportunity to go down and also point of information to Mr. Benedetto as far as if you're interested in getting anything from the conference itself, it's downloaded on MASC right on.

753
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:05,029
[SPEAKER_04]: on their website.

754
00:57:05,849 --> 00:57:08,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and again, I can't reiterate it enough.

755
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I sound like an old record.

756
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:12,512
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Paulette and I both sound like old records.

757
00:57:12,752 --> 00:57:13,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Been saying it for 12 years.

758
00:57:14,892 --> 00:57:17,953
[SPEAKER_04]: The date for the conference has already been scheduled for next year.

759
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:26,156
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that you really, especially members who have not got down to really go down, as the superintendent says, yes, you can look up certain things online.

760
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:27,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can get the information.

761
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:33,478
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes really meeting with that person on a one-to-one basis, especially like vendors or as

762
00:57:33,978 --> 00:57:54,027
[SPEAKER_04]: My colleague said, sitting down with the colleagues from all over the state, you really get to speak to each other and you do bond and you do, you know, over the years become friends and you can really vent on what's working for you, what isn't working for you, which way you're going, which way should, you know, and it has been very beneficial.

763
00:57:54,427 --> 00:57:58,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will get off my soapbox, but again, look at the date for next year.

764
00:57:58,509 --> 00:57:59,469
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a surprise.

765
00:57:59,669 --> 00:58:01,270
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes every year, just like Thanksgiving.

766
00:58:01,868 --> 00:58:04,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we all take our vacation time.

767
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:11,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I had used up most of it for other school committee member things, and I wasn't able to go as I usually go.

768
00:58:11,774 --> 00:58:13,595
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, it's very beneficial.

769
00:58:14,315 --> 00:58:14,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

770
00:58:15,476 --> 00:58:16,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Benedetto.

771
00:58:16,757 --> 00:58:19,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

772
00:58:19,478 --> 00:58:20,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a question.

773
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:24,341
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned school brains and how you got to speak to the vendor when you're down there.

774
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:32,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted, not directly to you, but to the superintendent, an update to make sure we're still on track and how it's going.

775
00:58:32,578 --> 00:58:33,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick update.

776
00:58:33,759 --> 00:58:37,080
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's not on the agenda, but since you mentioned it, it doesn't hurt to ask.

777
00:58:37,621 --> 00:58:38,921
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're making good progress.

778
00:58:38,981 --> 00:58:46,405
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, you know, a couple of tweaks here and there, but I think we've broken through the initial gridlock of trying to get some of that stuff to happen.

779
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:50,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you start to see things take fuller shape in the next little while.

780
00:58:50,456 --> 00:58:54,099
[SPEAKER_07]: And are all the teachers now trained in up and using school brains?

781
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:58,503
[SPEAKER_10]: In what they have to use so far, which was the grade book, the attendance.

782
00:58:59,684 --> 00:59:02,386
[SPEAKER_10]: I have not heard any grumbling, so that's a good sign.

783
00:59:03,327 --> 00:59:05,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I'd hear things if people were unhappy.

784
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:17,840
[SPEAKER_10]: The one issue that we talked to the vendor about had to do with the health services and Tony Vento had expressed to me some issues and they were going to, hopefully they did get in touch with her right away afterwards and work them out.

785
00:59:19,437 --> 00:59:24,160
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't heard, I think the teachers are comfortable, unless I'm missing something.

786
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And parents on ready to be put online?

787
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:33,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Ms.

788
00:59:33,725 --> 00:59:34,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuno.

789
00:59:34,285 --> 00:59:37,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Parents have already told me that they're excited because they're actually on.

790
00:59:37,727 --> 00:59:38,647
[SPEAKER_04]: They finally got on.

791
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:42,129
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that the high school- Is that all the parents you've been on, Ms.

792
00:59:42,189 --> 00:59:42,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Kreatz?

793
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:43,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

794
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,950
[SPEAKER_04]: So parents are definitely on.

795
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,012
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the elementary schools, Mr.

796
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:53,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Elementary was going to be a little bit later because they're in a different position right now.

797
00:59:53,553 --> 00:59:55,694
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't get report cards the same way the.

798
00:59:56,455 --> 00:59:59,876
[SPEAKER_14]: The others do, but will roll that out fairly soon.

799
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Diane can answer that specifically.

800
01:00:02,658 --> 01:00:03,358
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great.

801
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:11,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Some parents have asked me in the recent past, so I thought I'd just ask since someone mentioned it.

802
01:00:11,202 --> 01:00:16,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Paul has been very helpful with the school brains and I don't know if you want to.

803
01:00:17,399 --> 01:00:19,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there were some issues initially with people.

804
01:00:19,607 --> 01:00:23,649
[SPEAKER_10]: parents getting registered, but I'll let you speak to that.

805
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:32,112
[SPEAKER_13]: So the plan that we had implemented was we all sent out letters with usernames and passwords.

806
01:00:32,273 --> 01:00:37,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So the system allowed us to create usernames and passwords for families.

807
01:00:38,415 --> 01:00:45,438
[SPEAKER_13]: We made sure you look because what happens in the system sometimes kids were just registered for the Andrews, but then you had several siblings as well.

808
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:48,760
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would say the families that have.

809
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Multiple siblings in different schools, including elementary, have that access right now.

810
01:00:55,624 --> 01:00:59,086
[SPEAKER_13]: But the elementary is a different version.

811
01:00:59,647 --> 01:01:09,173
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, like the grade books that we're using for the high school and the middle school have values while the elementary report card does the standards base.

812
01:01:09,893 --> 01:01:14,636
[SPEAKER_13]: So the most that you're really going to see for an elementary student will be mostly attendance.

813
01:01:16,097 --> 01:01:16,878
[SPEAKER_07]: What about homework?

814
01:01:18,148 --> 01:01:20,049
[SPEAKER_07]: My teacher is posting homework.

815
01:01:20,229 --> 01:01:30,973
[SPEAKER_13]: So for the middle and high school, because this is a two-way communication via putting your assignment in there, grading your assignment, and then the parent has the ability to do that.

816
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:38,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, I'm not in the elementary world as much as I am for the middle and high school, but that's being posted.

817
01:01:39,456 --> 01:01:42,097
[SPEAKER_13]: From what I see, and like Ms.

818
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,538
[SPEAKER_13]: Cugno said, those letters are going out.

819
01:01:43,558 --> 01:01:49,459
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had plenty of parents that have contacted me, very happy and excited that they're able to view things.

820
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:53,281
[SPEAKER_13]: And if they run into problems, I've been more than able to help them through it.

821
01:01:53,301 --> 01:01:58,522
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to thank you for taking this on and helping our community.

822
01:01:58,542 --> 01:01:59,063
[SPEAKER_07]: It was important.

823
01:01:59,443 --> 01:02:04,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it is very important, and your time and expertise is appreciated.

824
01:02:04,424 --> 01:02:05,205
[SPEAKER_14]: My pleasure.

825
01:02:05,925 --> 01:02:06,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

826
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:06,405
[SPEAKER_09]: Kreatz.

827
01:02:07,488 --> 01:02:10,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I just want to share a point of information I've been on.

828
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:17,674
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see the full calendar, absence days, assignments.

829
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:22,998
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a link directly to the teacher, the grades.

830
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:26,880
[SPEAKER_09]: They matched up to the report cards that we just got at the high school.

831
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:32,504
[SPEAKER_09]: I needed to have another person added to my profile, sent an email.

832
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,625
[SPEAKER_09]: The profile got updated.

833
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,326
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really been really smooth.

834
01:02:37,138 --> 01:02:39,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't even access it from my phone.

835
01:02:42,194 --> 01:02:54,462
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's another good point of the system is, as Coretta said, the fact that we only had information of what was given to us from our old system, which probably needs to be updated as well.

836
01:02:54,502 --> 01:03:00,446
[SPEAKER_13]: So parents that do have the ability to get on have that ability to also adjust things, like they've changed their email.

837
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:02,767
[SPEAKER_13]: That happens all the time kind of thing.

838
01:03:02,807 --> 01:03:11,413
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have that ability to do it, and we can look and improve changes that are being made so that we have the updated information as well, which helps us as well on our end.

839
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:12,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Very good.

840
01:03:15,553 --> 01:03:21,116
[SPEAKER_12]: So the elementary, you will definitely be able to see the attendance as well as the standardized report cards.

841
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:27,559
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're going to open up that Parent Portal piece probably at the beginning of the, in January 2017.

842
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:37,703
[SPEAKER_12]: We just kind of wanted to wait to see how the middle school and the high school roll out, and then I'll send a memo home to all families and let them know.

843
01:03:39,404 --> 01:03:40,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely, sure.

844
01:03:53,576 --> 01:04:02,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we've had to import the report cards into School Brains from the elementary end, and it's been a little bit difficult because it didn't always transition the way we wanted it to.

845
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:11,764
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're continuing to work on that, and as it is now, I'm just getting emails that the reading stages weren't put in the right places, so I'll have to get to work on that tomorrow.

846
01:04:12,285 --> 01:04:13,425
[SPEAKER_12]: But Paul has been a lifesaver.

847
01:04:13,445 --> 01:04:14,686
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been working very hard on this.

848
01:04:17,307 --> 01:04:17,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

849
01:04:17,847 --> 01:04:18,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

850
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:18,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

851
01:04:20,109 --> 01:04:24,454
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

852
01:04:24,514 --> 01:04:26,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno, seconded by Ms.

853
01:04:26,556 --> 01:04:27,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

854
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:28,078
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

855
01:04:28,598 --> 01:04:28,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

856
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:29,439
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

857
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:30,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

858
01:04:31,722 --> 01:04:36,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on legalization of marijuana with recommendation for legislative modifications.

859
01:04:36,307 --> 01:04:37,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

860
01:04:37,508 --> 01:04:40,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, as you know, the

861
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:52,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Marijuana question passed the ballot in this past November by about 54% of the voters who actually voted.

862
01:04:55,412 --> 01:04:59,494
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the big questions, obviously, is there isn't enough regulatory guidance.

863
01:05:00,335 --> 01:05:04,157
[SPEAKER_14]: When you look at some of these ballot questions, they're very blunt instruments.

864
01:05:04,197 --> 01:05:06,358
[SPEAKER_14]: They can only ask for one thing up or down.

865
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:13,522
[SPEAKER_14]: And they don't really spell out all the things that are inside that need to happen in order to make it work well.

866
01:05:14,483 --> 01:05:15,443
[SPEAKER_14]: The Speaker of the House,

867
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:26,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Senate President and the Governor have all expressed their concerns, the Attorney General, about the lack of regulatory assistance that they have going forward.

868
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:36,695
[SPEAKER_14]: But they can't do much between now and January because they're in an informal session, and all you need is one legislator to object, and the matter can't be discussed.

869
01:05:37,415 --> 01:05:40,176
[SPEAKER_14]: and obviously there are people that don't want to talk about it right now.

870
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:51,660
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I expect that in January, the legislature will take this up in earnest, and the governor will follow quickly, and there'll be a lot of support for regulatory help.

871
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:59,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, it's under the state treasurer, Deborah Goldberg, for implementation, but it's unfunded.

872
01:06:00,704 --> 01:06:05,766
[SPEAKER_14]: She has no funds for it, nor does she have any appointees to her commission, and this is scheduled to go into effect December 15th.

873
01:06:07,201 --> 01:06:10,423
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's obviously some concerns about that.

874
01:06:10,963 --> 01:06:13,425
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a lot of different concerns that we have.

875
01:06:13,485 --> 01:06:18,308
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, obviously the medical marijuana piece is better regulated and that's already in place.

876
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:23,531
[SPEAKER_14]: But the recreational marijuana issues are not regulated at this point.

877
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:33,778
[SPEAKER_14]: So what basically I'm saying, it's imperative that school committees, school officials urge the legislature and the governor to take the necessary action

878
01:06:34,397 --> 01:06:36,898
[SPEAKER_14]: to prevent the misuse of this substance.

879
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,501
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we talk about opiates, we talk about all these things.

880
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:43,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I look at marijuana as a gateway drug.

881
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:47,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially when young people can get access to it.

882
01:06:47,995 --> 01:06:57,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, the minimum age is 21, but if a 21-year-old has it, I'm not sure that he or she is going to keep it from their friend who is 16 or 17.

883
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:01,500
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have a feeling that, you know, there were issues associated with that.

884
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:09,963
[SPEAKER_14]: So, here are some of the things that I would want to write to our legislators on behalf of the committee, and there may be others that we can add to it.

885
01:07:10,683 --> 01:07:14,566
[SPEAKER_14]: The first is to provide a local opt-in provision.

886
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:15,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now it's opt-out.

887
01:07:16,027 --> 01:07:19,769
[SPEAKER_14]: And in order to do it, you have to schedule a referendum vote that could be a year later.

888
01:07:21,451 --> 01:07:28,055
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to make them put it opt-in, which means you have to, as a community, decide to actually accept the rule for your community.

889
01:07:30,206 --> 01:07:30,646
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one.

890
01:07:32,088 --> 01:07:36,972
[SPEAKER_14]: It would mirror the Colorado law, which is currently in place, and we think that's a good piece to have.

891
01:07:37,973 --> 01:07:47,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Seventy percent of the communities in Marijuana ban their local areas for distributing it, so that's just an idea.

892
01:07:48,042 --> 01:07:50,484
[SPEAKER_14]: The second thing is substantially increase the tax rate.

893
01:07:51,285 --> 01:07:51,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now it's 3.75.

894
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:58,291
[SPEAKER_14]: At that rate, while it might generate some money, it won't generate enough money for enforcement.

895
01:07:58,731 --> 01:08:00,412
[SPEAKER_14]: It won't generate enough money for control.

896
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:09,074
[SPEAKER_14]: It won't generate enough money for data collection, for the kinds of things that have to go forward in order for us to modify and improve the law as we go forward.

897
01:08:09,594 --> 01:08:21,998
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we think that the legislature should increase that tax, maybe even double it, in order to ensure that there's sufficient funds to regulate recreational marijuana.

898
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,112
[SPEAKER_14]: We think they should eliminate the home-grown provision.

899
01:08:26,994 --> 01:08:31,978
[SPEAKER_14]: The provision as it currently stands will not adequately be enforced.

900
01:08:32,038 --> 01:08:45,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's to know who's going to go in whose home to get warrants to go in people's homes to see if they've only got six plants, or how they're using it, or whether they're putting it in brownies, or whether they're putting in these kinds of things and distributing it in ways that cannot be easily detected.

901
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:51,675
[SPEAKER_14]: The other piece on this is that the way the marijuana is grown today,

902
01:08:52,643 --> 01:08:55,404
[SPEAKER_14]: The intensity of it is much stronger than it was years ago.

903
01:08:56,105 --> 01:09:02,808
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't know if it's going to be spiced or spliced, if you will, with other substances in certain venues that may be at home.

904
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:03,589
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't control it.

905
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:15,134
[SPEAKER_14]: So we think the homegrown piece needs to be looked at in order for us to protect underage students and underage people, or anyone in particular.

906
01:09:15,815 --> 01:09:21,638
[SPEAKER_14]: We think they need to strengthen the control commission to better understand the impact and to effectively regulate the industry.

907
01:09:22,594 --> 01:09:29,655
[SPEAKER_14]: The commission should have a staff that collects data to inform future modifications that may be necessary to protect public safety.

908
01:09:30,076 --> 01:09:38,037
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't have data out there as to what's happening, whether there's connection between recreational marijuana use and other drug use, you don't know what's going on.

909
01:09:38,057 --> 01:09:41,298
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't know if you're helping or hurting what's happening.

910
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:47,539
[SPEAKER_14]: So, the initiative petition process, like I say, can be a valuable part of the democratic system.

911
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:51,480
[SPEAKER_14]: However, it's a very blunt instrument and it needs to be refined.

912
01:09:52,637 --> 01:10:00,662
[SPEAKER_14]: We obviously will respect the will of the people as we do with all initiative petitions, and the legislature very rarely overturns the will of the people.

913
01:10:01,222 --> 01:10:07,506
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's no reason why they can't modify it and refine it, and I think the interest is there on the part of the leadership.

914
01:10:07,566 --> 01:10:20,173
[SPEAKER_14]: So, what I'd like to do is draft a letter to our legislators on behalf of the committee and the school department administration with these suggestions, and hope that they will take action as swiftly as possible at the turn of the

915
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:23,474
[SPEAKER_14]: of the year when the legislature goes back into formal session.

916
01:10:24,194 --> 01:10:28,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval of the recommendations made by the superintendent by Ms.

917
01:10:28,336 --> 01:10:29,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Cuno, seconded by Ms.

918
01:10:29,556 --> 01:10:29,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz.

919
01:10:30,036 --> 01:10:30,716
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote.

920
01:10:32,837 --> 01:10:33,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

921
01:10:34,178 --> 01:10:37,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd want to see any such letter before we approve the letter.

922
01:10:38,579 --> 01:10:40,060
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd want to see a draft of that.

923
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,180
[SPEAKER_14]: I can bring that to you.

924
01:10:43,061 --> 01:10:45,401
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion that the letter be drafted.

925
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:46,782
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

926
01:10:47,502 --> 01:10:48,222
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

927
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:49,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

928
01:10:53,472 --> 01:10:56,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on Metro Public Schools' disciplinary statistics.

929
01:10:56,759 --> 01:11:02,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So, the state just released the disciplinary statistics from 2015-2016.

930
01:11:03,381 --> 01:11:07,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford is well below the numbers for the state on average.

931
01:11:07,982 --> 01:11:11,362
[SPEAKER_14]: I've given you some of the reports that I was able to download offline.

932
01:11:11,382 --> 01:11:14,443
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to do a little bit more analysis, but we're well below.

933
01:11:14,983 --> 01:11:26,486
[SPEAKER_14]: I gave you some categories that would give you some ideas about different areas, whether it be substance abuse, marijuana, physical theft or assault or anything of that type.

934
01:11:26,906 --> 01:11:27,826
[SPEAKER_14]: for you to look over.

935
01:11:28,207 --> 01:11:33,268
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll do a bigger report going forward but I wanted you to have something to look at.

936
01:11:33,768 --> 01:11:43,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I think some of our initiatives in terms of providing additional programs for youngsters rather than sending them home have worked and will continue to work and we need to strengthen them going forward.

937
01:11:43,592 --> 01:11:50,874
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think those things are positive steps for us and I think it shows in the results and we'll continue to show in the results going forward.

938
01:11:51,734 --> 01:11:52,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Great job.

939
01:11:54,492 --> 01:11:55,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

940
01:11:56,093 --> 01:12:03,115
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was reading through some of this, the student group that really stood out to me is High Needs.

941
01:12:03,695 --> 01:12:06,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is exactly the definition of High Needs in this?

942
01:12:07,216 --> 01:12:09,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, High Needs is a conglomerate group.

943
01:12:10,177 --> 01:12:13,778
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be economically disadvantaged, it could be special needs, it could be ELL.

944
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:21,200
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a grouping that sort of is an omnibus for all the different groups that have been identified as disaggregated groups.

945
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,021
[SPEAKER_14]: And we try to

946
01:12:24,861 --> 01:12:31,885
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that, but sometimes it's hard to know who's in the group because you don't know who they've included in the group.

947
01:12:31,905 --> 01:12:41,311
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it's pretty much the youngsters who fall into groups like special needs, EOL, economically disadvantaged, and some other groups that might be lesser known.

948
01:12:41,871 --> 01:12:52,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really feel like this data is extremely helpful in supporting our children that are having disciplinary issues and identifying the first step

949
01:12:53,177 --> 01:12:54,198
[SPEAKER_07]: for helping them.

950
01:12:54,678 --> 01:13:02,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm glad that you're going to look at this data a little more closely, and whatever plans you come up with, I'd really like a report back on.

951
01:13:02,903 --> 01:13:04,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, we will do that.

952
01:13:04,244 --> 01:13:09,688
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you know, we've talked about this as adding programs, these opportunities for change and things like that.

953
01:13:10,088 --> 01:13:15,712
[SPEAKER_14]: There are alternative insides which keep kids from being, let's say, sent home and given some additional help or counseling.

954
01:13:16,565 --> 01:13:17,726
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we're pushing towards.

955
01:13:17,766 --> 01:13:20,127
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we're going to try to keep doing.

956
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:24,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Budget's permitting, obviously, and I think that that's reflected in our numbers.

957
01:13:25,331 --> 01:13:43,483
[SPEAKER_07]: My experience working within schools is that a lot of disciplinary issues are based on either social emotional or the fact that they're struggling academically and they would rather act out in a behavioral way rather than have their peers or even their teachers

958
01:13:44,527 --> 01:13:54,651
[SPEAKER_07]: lose respect for their abilities or, you know, they just want to stay in control and that's how they act out so that nobody sees that they're struggling academically.

959
01:13:55,091 --> 01:13:56,492
[SPEAKER_07]: So identifying those students.

960
01:13:56,512 --> 01:13:58,493
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why the emphasis on social emotional learning.

961
01:13:58,993 --> 01:13:59,153
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

962
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:00,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very good.

963
01:14:01,195 --> 01:14:04,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I just threw you to the superintendent.

964
01:14:04,597 --> 01:14:10,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that Dr. Perella and his team actually had a couple of things going on the last few years at the high school.

965
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:18,524
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them was instead of sending students home and getting them suspended, he had them actually in more of a.

966
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:21,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a one-on-one type of situation.

967
01:14:21,546 --> 01:14:23,006
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the opportunities for change program.

968
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:23,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

969
01:14:23,607 --> 01:14:30,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last year he was talking about this year, this academic school year, that they had started another program.

970
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:30,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Nexus.

971
01:14:30,749 --> 01:14:33,451
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the one, I forgot the name of it, so I apologize.

972
01:14:33,771 --> 01:14:37,772
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would like an update on that, if possible.

973
01:14:38,293 --> 01:14:44,155
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been in school for a few months, I'd like to know numbers, how's it going, what they're doing.

974
01:14:44,175 --> 01:14:46,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably halfway through the year, let's give it a half a year to really

975
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:50,416
[SPEAKER_04]: – Okay, after the holidays or something, but I would like to see that.

976
01:14:50,436 --> 01:14:50,896
[SPEAKER_14]: – Sure.

977
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:51,677
[SPEAKER_04]: – Ms.

978
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:52,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Van der Kloot.

979
01:14:52,217 --> 01:14:53,037
[SPEAKER_11]: – Yes.

980
01:14:53,357 --> 01:14:56,758
[SPEAKER_11]: In looking at the data, there's one thing to me which is a little unclear.

981
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:05,341
[SPEAKER_11]: It uses the entire population, 4,529 students, but it doesn't break it down into levels.

982
01:15:05,481 --> 01:15:11,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, so you could assume or jump to the conclusion that all of these things are taking place

983
01:15:12,247 --> 01:15:14,067
[SPEAKER_11]: at the high school, which there are not many.

984
01:15:14,127 --> 01:15:15,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to be clear about that.

985
01:15:16,228 --> 01:15:22,229
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's not necessarily true, or perhaps I don't have the data that tells me whether they're high school or middle school.

986
01:15:22,249 --> 01:15:23,509
[SPEAKER_14]: We will break it down further.

987
01:15:23,669 --> 01:15:28,590
[SPEAKER_14]: This came out just at the end of the week, and we just sort of wanted to get it out because it was being announced.

988
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:32,011
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same token, we have more time to break it down now.

989
01:15:32,271 --> 01:15:39,192
[SPEAKER_11]: So the data, as far as I'm looking at it, would be more helpful if we were to break it down between elementary, middle, and high.

990
01:15:39,772 --> 01:15:40,212
[SPEAKER_11]: We can do that.

991
01:15:42,382 --> 01:15:42,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Very good.

992
01:15:42,822 --> 01:15:47,246
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to get a further report broken down by elementary, middle school, and high school.

993
01:15:47,386 --> 01:15:48,287
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

994
01:15:48,307 --> 01:15:49,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

995
01:15:49,187 --> 01:15:49,908
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

996
01:15:50,168 --> 01:15:50,969
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

997
01:15:51,389 --> 01:15:54,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to receive and place this report on file.

998
01:15:54,432 --> 01:15:55,192
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

999
01:15:55,212 --> 01:15:55,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1000
01:15:56,173 --> 01:15:57,014
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1001
01:15:57,134 --> 01:15:57,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1002
01:16:00,316 --> 01:16:03,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Report on school system guidance on national election results.

1003
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:04,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent.

1004
01:16:05,953 --> 01:16:12,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I received a number of phone calls from a number of you and others with regard to the election results that took place on November 8th.

1005
01:16:13,798 --> 01:16:23,745
[SPEAKER_14]: And school systems around the Commonwealth and around the country received multiple inquiries from parents and citizens regarding classroom discussions about the recent national election results.

1006
01:16:24,424 --> 01:16:36,672
[SPEAKER_14]: and concerns were raised about some teachers or staff who might introduce their personal opinions and feelings into what might be considered a very charged current topic leading to possible conflict.

1007
01:16:39,354 --> 01:16:42,176
[SPEAKER_14]: As we know, elections are a fundamental element of democracy.

1008
01:16:42,416 --> 01:16:47,919
[SPEAKER_14]: The process of elections and the substantive issues are a legitimate part of citizenship education.

1009
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:53,523
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't eliminate either process or substance from our schools and our classrooms.

1010
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:59,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Naturally, discussions must be age-appropriate and devoid of any hostility for expressions of opinion.

1011
01:17:00,507 --> 01:17:04,934
[SPEAKER_14]: There can be no discussions that are racist and discriminatory towards any group.

1012
01:17:05,795 --> 01:17:11,176
[SPEAKER_14]: and adult personnel must ensure that inappropriate comments are not introduced or perpetuated.

1013
01:17:11,936 --> 01:17:24,719
[SPEAKER_14]: So on Wednesday morning, November 9th, I sent out an email to principals, which is listed here, and I wanted to read it so the public did not see it, they understand this, because you've asked me sometimes, do people know this?

1014
01:17:24,759 --> 01:17:30,560
[SPEAKER_14]: And we try to put it out, but obviously not everybody reads everything that we have.

1015
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:35,021
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wrote, colleagues, last evening citizens elected a new president of our country.

1016
01:17:35,772 --> 01:17:38,993
[SPEAKER_14]: I recognize this election was extremely contentious and polarizing.

1017
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:43,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Undoubtedly, there were many strong feelings among faculty, staff, and students.

1018
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:49,315
[SPEAKER_14]: It's extremely important that we do not engage in divisive discussions that can inflame feelings and behaviors.

1019
01:17:49,995 --> 01:17:59,137
[SPEAKER_14]: As educators, we must strive to help our students understand that we have a democratic process and that we need to go forward in a constructive way to support our country and our own people.

1020
01:17:59,818 --> 01:18:01,358
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no room for hate messaging.

1021
01:18:01,998 --> 01:18:08,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Our students must learn that in this country we accept the constitutional process that transfers power after a legitimate election.

1022
01:18:08,862 --> 01:18:11,524
[SPEAKER_14]: This does not mean there can be no discussion of the election.

1023
01:18:12,004 --> 01:18:15,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Any discussion must be respectful and constructive.

1024
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:17,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your attention to this guidance, and I signed it.

1025
01:18:18,668 --> 01:18:24,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Our principals were expected to instruct their faculty and staff of the above expectation, and I have not received any

1026
01:18:25,148 --> 01:18:29,593
[SPEAKER_14]: information from principles that inappropriate discussions have taken place in our classrooms at this time.

1027
01:18:30,153 --> 01:18:31,655
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll continue to emphasize this.

1028
01:18:31,695 --> 01:18:34,979
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll continue to allow people to discuss the electoral process.

1029
01:18:35,019 --> 01:18:36,400
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to discuss the electoral college.

1030
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,101
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to discuss

1031
01:18:37,578 --> 01:18:42,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Popular votes, they want to discuss states, they want to look at reasons why people vote, that's one thing.

1032
01:18:42,841 --> 01:18:53,967
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's no room in the schools, in the classroom for adult personnel to encourage students to be hostile about any result or in the light we have, we have to get on with business.

1033
01:18:54,527 --> 01:18:59,670
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the message that's out there and we'll continue to monitor what takes place over the next while.

1034
01:19:00,731 --> 01:19:01,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1035
01:19:01,932 --> 01:19:21,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And even Thursday when we attended the veteran's ceremony that was spoken about earlier this evening, it was made clear that to stay away from this topic, the students and the teachers have all been kind of addressed through this email, and that let's just deal with the Veterans Day topic at hand and not delve into the high emotions that have been running.

1036
01:19:22,043 --> 01:19:24,604
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think one of your lines in here really sums it up.

1037
01:19:24,624 --> 01:19:26,606
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no room for hate messaging.

1038
01:19:27,466 --> 01:19:34,234
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that message is loud and clear from not only the superintendent, but the city, school committee members, etc.

1039
01:19:34,294 --> 01:19:41,944
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just really need to strive to raise it up, raise the level of conversation up, and treat all people equally.

1040
01:19:42,104 --> 01:19:42,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So, thank you.

1041
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,822
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion to receive and place on file this report.

1042
01:19:48,402 --> 01:19:49,143
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1043
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:49,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1044
01:19:49,984 --> 01:19:50,744
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1045
01:19:51,044 --> 01:19:51,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1046
01:19:52,585 --> 01:19:57,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Recommendation to approve graduation date for MHS and MVTHS class of 2017.

1047
01:20:01,211 --> 01:20:02,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's our standard.

1048
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:03,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our standard.

1049
01:20:03,352 --> 01:20:05,413
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's going to be June 7th.

1050
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:07,814
[SPEAKER_08]: June 7th at the Gancher.

1051
01:20:07,834 --> 01:20:08,955
[SPEAKER_08]: 6 p.m.

1052
01:20:10,436 --> 01:20:12,517
[SPEAKER_08]: at the Wednesday evening.

1053
01:20:13,137 --> 01:20:14,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Mark your calendars, people.

1054
01:20:14,838 --> 01:20:17,900
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, we do this in part this early, and I'll tell you why we do it.

1055
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:24,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Not only to help people plan, but once we lock into a date, if it snows, we still can get the days in, you know, even if the

1056
01:20:26,384 --> 01:20:30,587
[SPEAKER_14]: They're on 12 days between graduation and the last day for seniors.

1057
01:20:31,027 --> 01:20:35,109
[SPEAKER_14]: So we walk in with the state in case we have extra snow days and the like.

1058
01:20:35,149 --> 01:20:36,310
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why we do it so quickly.

1059
01:20:37,127 --> 01:20:39,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this date for graduation?

1060
01:20:39,929 --> 01:20:40,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1061
01:20:40,149 --> 01:20:40,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

1062
01:20:41,009 --> 01:20:42,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1063
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,151
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1064
01:20:43,171 --> 01:20:45,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry, you moved it first.

1065
01:20:46,133 --> 01:20:47,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Skerry moved it first.

1066
01:20:47,393 --> 01:20:47,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1067
01:20:47,573 --> 01:20:48,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

1068
01:20:48,614 --> 01:20:49,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Ms.

1069
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:49,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Cugno.

1070
01:20:50,035 --> 01:20:51,036
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1071
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:52,677
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1072
01:20:52,877 --> 01:20:53,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1073
01:20:54,198 --> 01:20:54,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, we have one.

1074
01:20:55,038 --> 01:20:55,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1075
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have old business, but it wasn't listed?

1076
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we do have old business.

1077
01:20:58,380 --> 01:20:58,460
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1078
01:20:58,640 --> 01:20:59,501
[SPEAKER_14]: There's two items there.

1079
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:03,083
[SPEAKER_14]: One is the crossing guards, and the other is how it's been.

1080
01:21:03,103 --> 01:21:03,843
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not listed for us.

1081
01:21:03,883 --> 01:21:05,484
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't get printed for us.

1082
01:21:07,258 --> 01:21:11,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to place negotiations and legal matters to the end of the agenda, authored by Ms.

1083
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1084
01:21:14,321 --> 01:21:15,001
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1085
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:16,282
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1086
01:21:16,762 --> 01:21:18,562
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be placed at the end of the agenda.

1087
01:21:19,063 --> 01:21:24,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Old Business is an update on the crossing guard issue that was raised last meeting.

1088
01:21:24,765 --> 01:21:27,866
[SPEAKER_08]: It had to do with the Fellsway location in particular.

1089
01:21:28,346 --> 01:21:32,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Two locations on the Fellsway actually, one at the base of Fels Ave and one at the base of Fulton Street.

1090
01:21:33,428 --> 01:21:38,610
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the superintendent has been in touch with Mr. Representative Donato.

1091
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:49,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I spoke with Commissioner Roy of the DCR and he said that he had the engineers go out and they do not see any issues with extending the time limit on the push button.

1092
01:21:49,915 --> 01:21:55,717
[SPEAKER_08]: They said that that was too, people complained that it was too short to get across the entire Fellsway, which is quite a wide road.

1093
01:21:56,277 --> 01:21:58,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Så han sagde att det kommer att uppstå.

1094
01:21:58,098 --> 01:22:01,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Han ville kalla mig tillbaka för att ge mig en exakt datum.

1095
01:22:01,039 --> 01:22:05,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Jag fråade honom om crossingsgården, och han sa att de verkligen försöker att slås av crossingsgården.

1096
01:22:05,662 --> 01:22:08,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Och jag menade att det kan finnas några ställen som har mindre visibilitet.

1097
01:22:08,943 --> 01:22:16,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Så om det är möjligt, om han kan placerar en crossingsgård som är i Medford, kanske på den här platsen, och då kan vi kanske förändra vägen till busen för att uppstå de mindre barn som är affektade på olika ställen.

1098
01:22:25,772 --> 01:22:30,875
[SPEAKER_08]: He was going to go back to the drawing boards and talk to his people to see if that's a possibility.

1099
01:22:30,895 --> 01:22:31,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Ms.

1100
01:22:31,856 --> 01:22:34,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Kreatz, do you have an update as well?

1101
01:22:34,457 --> 01:22:35,818
[SPEAKER_09]: A similar update.

1102
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:52,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I heard from Matt Hartman in State Senator Jalen's office, and with some good news that they are going to add some additional time on to the crossing light, where you cross over at the corner of Fulton Street and Fellsway.

1103
01:22:57,188 --> 01:23:08,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I would still recommend that you cross over to the next island, press the next button, and then cross over rather than trying to make it all the way across five lanes.

1104
01:23:09,034 --> 01:23:11,116
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, just for safety, it's just a good idea.

1105
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:17,987
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't get a date on when that's going to happen, but he's going to be calling back, so we'll get the word out here.

1106
01:23:18,067 --> 01:23:26,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Representative Donato emailed me back today saying his meeting is scheduled for next for the first week in December with DCR.

1107
01:23:27,177 --> 01:23:28,578
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's going to do it.

1108
01:23:28,678 --> 01:23:32,382
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, on this particular thing, my handwriting undoubtedly.

1109
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:34,572
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1110
01:23:34,852 --> 01:23:35,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1111
01:23:35,173 --> 01:23:35,613
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1112
01:23:35,633 --> 01:23:35,933
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay.

1113
01:23:36,013 --> 01:23:36,253
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1114
01:23:36,273 --> 01:23:36,493
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1115
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:36,873
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1116
01:23:36,893 --> 01:23:37,113
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1117
01:23:37,133 --> 01:23:37,373
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1118
01:23:37,393 --> 01:23:37,834
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1119
01:23:37,854 --> 01:23:38,134
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1120
01:23:38,154 --> 01:23:38,434
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1121
01:23:38,474 --> 01:23:38,694
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1122
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:38,974
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1123
01:23:38,994 --> 01:23:39,214
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1124
01:23:39,234 --> 01:23:39,554
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1125
01:23:39,574 --> 01:23:39,874
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1126
01:23:39,894 --> 01:23:40,214
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1127
01:23:40,234 --> 01:23:40,475
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1128
01:23:40,495 --> 01:23:40,715
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1129
01:23:40,735 --> 01:23:41,035
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1130
01:23:41,055 --> 01:23:41,355
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1131
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:41,735
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1132
01:23:41,775 --> 01:23:42,175
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1133
01:23:42,215 --> 01:23:42,435
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1134
01:23:42,455 --> 01:23:42,755
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1135
01:23:42,775 --> 01:23:43,015
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1136
01:23:43,035 --> 01:23:43,296
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1137
01:23:43,316 --> 01:23:43,536
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1138
01:23:43,556 --> 01:23:43,776
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1139
01:23:43,796 --> 01:23:44,096
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1140
01:23:44,116 --> 01:23:44,416
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1141
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:44,716
[SPEAKER_09]: That's okay.

1142
01:23:44,756 --> 01:23:45,116
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1143
01:23:45,136 --> 01:23:45,776
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1144
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:46,197
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1145
01:23:46,217 --> 01:23:46,497
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1146
01:23:46,517 --> 01:23:46,757
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1147
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:47,237
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1148
01:23:47,277 --> 01:23:47,517
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1149
01:23:47,537 --> 01:23:47,997
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1150
01:23:48,017 --> 01:23:48,317
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1151
01:23:48,337 --> 01:23:48,718
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1152
01:23:48,758 --> 01:23:49,418
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1153
01:23:50,778 --> 01:23:51,078
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1154
01:23:51,539 --> 01:23:51,859
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1155
01:23:51,879 --> 01:23:52,159
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1156
01:23:52,179 --> 01:23:52,439
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1157
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:52,739
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

1158
01:23:52,759 --> 01:23:53,019
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1159
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:53,379
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1160
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:53,639
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1161
01:23:53,659 --> 01:23:53,960
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1162
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:54,320
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1163
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:54,700
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay.

1164
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:55,100
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

1165
01:23:59,581 --> 01:24:04,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I want to ask a question to the chair.

1166
01:24:04,107 --> 01:24:08,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe that there actually is a button to push in the middle of the road.

1167
01:24:08,512 --> 01:24:13,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you get stuck on the island and run out of time, I think you're stuck on the island.

1168
01:24:14,325 --> 01:24:19,369
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to throw that out there, but I don't believe there is a button in the middle.

1169
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:24,794
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the added time will be sufficient to get across the entire cycle, because right now it's what, 12?

1170
01:24:25,415 --> 01:24:30,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also hoping that if they wish to get out of the crossing guard business, that maybe we'll consider getting in the crossing guard business.

1171
01:24:30,759 --> 01:24:38,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we are in the crossing guard business, and we would have to do an MOU, memorandum of understanding, in order to take over their location.

1172
01:24:38,932 --> 01:24:42,316
[SPEAKER_08]: or their street in particular, so we will have to review that.

1173
01:24:42,776 --> 01:24:47,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, we didn't build that into this year's budget, but we certainly will take a look at it for next year.

1174
01:24:47,461 --> 01:24:53,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for your consideration.

1175
01:24:58,231 --> 01:24:58,952
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to address that here?

1176
01:25:00,750 --> 01:25:06,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Greenspan, we also have a report that was asked for in regards to the American International College.

1177
01:25:07,177 --> 01:25:08,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent, would you like to address it?

1178
01:25:08,879 --> 01:25:15,827
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have a copy of it, you know, that you requested this and it takes a while for us to get answers from Ethics, but here it is.

1179
01:25:15,847 --> 01:25:20,652
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a question about a potential conflict of interest in regards to American International College, AIC.

1180
01:25:22,255 --> 01:25:33,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Greenspan wrote a lengthy report to this committee, dated November 14, 2016, in which he... Would you like to... Thank you, Mayor.

1181
01:25:34,899 --> 01:25:47,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Belson did contact my office a while ago, informing me that the committee had asked some questions as to whether or not there was a potential conflict of interest in connection with

1182
01:25:49,224 --> 01:25:59,307
[SPEAKER_00]: the school district leasing facilities to American International College, and teachers or administrators working for the college.

1183
01:26:00,508 --> 01:26:18,253
[SPEAKER_00]: After review of the statutes and some of the regulations, I've written a report to the committee dated November 14th, and I've concluded, after reviewing the sections of the statute, the conflict of interest law and the regulations promulgated by the Ethics Commission,

1184
01:26:18,938 --> 01:26:25,100
[SPEAKER_00]: that there would be no conflict of interest for our teachers or administrators to work for AIC.

1185
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:37,423
[SPEAKER_00]: These issues and questions are very fact-specific, based on the facts that I've received from the superintendent, which are in the report.

1186
01:26:38,763 --> 01:26:43,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the superintendent is involved with the negotiations, maybe with the business manager.

1187
01:26:44,625 --> 01:26:46,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers do not have any preference

1188
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:48,931
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of the hiring process.

1189
01:26:50,411 --> 01:27:12,098
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the regulations which I attached to the report specifically provides that a public employee can hold an additional paid position with a second employer, where the only impediment to the employment arises because the second employer occupies premises pursuant to a contract or agreement with the public agency.

1190
01:27:12,989 --> 01:27:19,590
[SPEAKER_00]: So, based upon that regulation and a review of other sections of the statute, it's my opinion that there is no conflict.

1191
01:27:21,091 --> 01:27:21,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1192
01:27:21,551 --> 01:27:22,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Greenspan.

1193
01:27:23,711 --> 01:27:24,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

1194
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:25,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1195
01:27:25,372 --> 01:27:26,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your report.

1196
01:27:27,412 --> 01:27:30,693
[SPEAKER_07]: So, did this report go through the State Ethics Commission?

1197
01:27:30,713 --> 01:27:35,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that was what was requested at the time that the report was asked for.

1198
01:27:38,134 --> 01:27:39,234
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke with the commission.

1199
01:27:39,294 --> 01:27:41,915
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not issue the opinion, but I did speak to

1200
01:27:42,817 --> 01:27:44,439
[SPEAKER_00]: an attorney at the commission.

1201
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:59,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he email you his... They did not write an opinion, but they did reference to me that regulation that was attached, but there was no written opinion from the ethics commission.

1202
01:28:00,157 --> 01:28:02,618
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding was that the committee wanted an opinion from me.

1203
01:28:02,678 --> 01:28:07,319
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know they wanted- No, it was to get an opinion from the State Ethics Commission.

1204
01:28:07,359 --> 01:28:09,439
[SPEAKER_07]: That was what was requested.

1205
01:28:09,799 --> 01:28:12,220
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have no problem with this.

1206
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:19,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that we're open and honest with all dealings, with any businesses that are also renting our community schools.

1207
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:31,993
[SPEAKER_07]: and that it's out there so that there is no impression by anyone in our community that anything is other than forthright.

1208
01:28:32,533 --> 01:28:36,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really the request.

1209
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:46,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I have great respect for the people that work in our community, but we just need to make sure everybody in our community understands where we stand.

1210
01:28:46,598 --> 01:28:47,499
[SPEAKER_07]: We're open and honest.

1211
01:28:47,519 --> 01:28:51,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we run this international college school in our building.

1212
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of our administrators and some of our teachers are employed there.

1213
01:28:55,822 --> 01:28:57,182
[SPEAKER_07]: We are well aware of it.

1214
01:28:57,282 --> 01:29:04,485
[SPEAKER_07]: They only work for them at those hours and not during school hours, that we're renting them at the same rent.

1215
01:29:05,045 --> 01:29:10,130
[SPEAKER_07]: and time and usage as we rent to other people just because our employees are there.

1216
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:11,451
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no deals given.

1217
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:14,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want it to be clear.

1218
01:29:14,534 --> 01:29:16,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Like honestly, that's what I'm looking for.

1219
01:29:16,496 --> 01:29:24,263
[SPEAKER_07]: Communication, transparency, and putting it all on the table so that there's no little innuendos or questions asked.

1220
01:29:24,603 --> 01:29:28,567
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they are asked, we can stand up here and answer them directly and honestly.

1221
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:32,409
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the intent of requesting this information.

1222
01:29:32,469 --> 01:29:35,930
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know sometimes it seems like there's more behind it.

1223
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:36,790
[SPEAKER_07]: There really isn't.

1224
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:47,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So given this, are we charging them the exact rate or we're charging other people that are using the same time and amount of our facility?

1225
01:29:47,152 --> 01:29:53,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So by our rules, people who have extended use of our facilities can negotiate some of the rates.

1226
01:29:53,714 --> 01:29:54,574
[SPEAKER_14]: That's by our rules.

1227
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:56,615
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we take about $60,000 a year from them.

1228
01:29:58,343 --> 01:30:02,006
[SPEAKER_14]: for about five sessions of, you know, maybe 20 courses that are run during the year.

1229
01:30:02,427 --> 01:30:06,811
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's pretty consistent with what, you know, our revenue would be.

1230
01:30:07,372 --> 01:30:10,675
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, we obviously update it over time as they use facilities.

1231
01:30:11,015 --> 01:30:12,717
[SPEAKER_14]: If they use more facilities, we'll charge them more.

1232
01:30:12,737 --> 01:30:14,999
[SPEAKER_14]: If they use less, we'll obviously modify it down.

1233
01:30:15,019 --> 01:30:17,041
[SPEAKER_14]: So we consider that, you know, consistent.

1234
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:23,467
[SPEAKER_07]: So in your opinion, the people that work for this program,

1235
01:30:24,296 --> 01:30:29,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not interfering with their day job, and their day job is not interfering.

1236
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:36,024
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, at this point in time, I don't think there's anyone in our faculty or administration that's actually teaching a course right now.

1237
01:30:36,064 --> 01:30:41,347
[SPEAKER_14]: So I mean, it happens sporadically, but if it happens, it could happen.

1238
01:30:41,587 --> 01:30:45,109
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just teaching, it's administrating, too, as well.

1239
01:30:45,129 --> 01:30:45,830
[SPEAKER_14]: No, same thing.

1240
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:50,733
[SPEAKER_14]: The only contact that we do with them is through our offices to set up the contract for use.

1241
01:30:51,373 --> 01:30:52,134
[SPEAKER_14]: And then after that,

1242
01:30:53,186 --> 01:30:56,808
[SPEAKER_14]: If they want someone, and the person has to be selected by them, by the way.

1243
01:30:56,848 --> 01:31:01,790
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have any, let's say, ability to influence who they select.

1244
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:05,311
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't tell them who can teach.

1245
01:31:05,331 --> 01:31:07,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Who can't teach.

1246
01:31:07,132 --> 01:31:11,874
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like the intent of my request has been fulfilled.

1247
01:31:12,854 --> 01:31:16,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for the report and thank you for your time, Mr. Greenspan.

1248
01:31:17,323 --> 01:31:18,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to receive this report?

1249
01:31:18,944 --> 01:31:20,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to receive.

1250
01:31:20,966 --> 01:31:21,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Ms.

1251
01:31:21,667 --> 01:31:23,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Van der Kloot.

1252
01:31:23,388 --> 01:31:24,289
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

1253
01:31:24,649 --> 01:31:24,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1254
01:31:25,009 --> 01:31:25,690
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

1255
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:26,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion carries.

1256
01:31:28,432 --> 01:31:30,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent, wanted to make an announcement?

1257
01:31:30,213 --> 01:31:31,675
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a couple of quick things.

1258
01:31:32,135 --> 01:31:34,317
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to pass this out to each of you.

1259
01:31:36,218 --> 01:31:43,484
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a, something that I, let me pass it down, something that I acquired yesterday when I was in Newport.

1260
01:31:46,092 --> 01:32:10,356
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a good timing kind of thing because what it is is a letter from George Washington to the first Jewish synagogue in America in Newport, Rhode Island, but there's also references to Washington speaking to other congregations of other denominations in 1890, 1790 rather.

1261
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:25,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Washington at the time was asked whether or not there would be any discrimination in America against religion.

1262
01:32:26,817 --> 01:32:45,052
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you read the letter from Washington, which is perhaps one of the most famous letters of all time, and I wanted to share it with you because I've got copies, he basically said that in this country, you're going to get the actual wording,

1263
01:32:54,221 --> 01:33:05,806
[SPEAKER_14]: that there would be no, you know, toleration of bigotry, and there would be no allowance for discrimination.

1264
01:33:06,586 --> 01:33:13,409
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a very useful kind of thing because it predates the signing of the Bill of Rights by one year.

1265
01:33:13,429 --> 01:33:17,190
[SPEAKER_14]: In 18, not 18, I keep saying 18, 1791, New Jersey, on the same date as yesterday, the 19th of November,

1266
01:33:25,234 --> 01:33:27,455
[SPEAKER_14]: was the first state to sign the Bill of Rights.

1267
01:33:28,696 --> 01:33:51,770
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we go through a period where we sometimes hear people saying things, you know, about hatred and other issues that we talked about tonight, it goes right back to George Washington, who says basically, for happily the government of the United States will give no bigotry, will give bigotry no sanction, and to persecution no assistance.

1268
01:33:52,665 --> 01:34:03,429
[SPEAKER_14]: requires that only they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving all the occasions of their effectual support."

1269
01:34:03,869 --> 01:34:06,930
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's basically saying, no bigotry, no discrimination.

1270
01:34:07,711 --> 01:34:16,634
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's absolutely totally appropriate at this time as we see some of the hateful activity that sometimes has found its way into our country in recent times.

1271
01:34:16,694 --> 01:34:18,395
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just thought you might enjoy it.

1272
01:34:18,415 --> 01:34:21,496
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also some listings of other congregations that he spoke to.

1273
01:34:22,502 --> 01:34:37,593
[SPEAKER_14]: It's quite impressive that this place survived as long as it is in its original form, pretty much original form, going through several periods where it was not allowed to exist by different groups, by the British and by others.

1274
01:34:37,613 --> 01:34:41,536
[SPEAKER_14]: So just something that you might have and could use.

1275
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:42,643
[SPEAKER_14]: in your work.

1276
01:34:42,964 --> 01:34:44,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1277
01:34:44,084 --> 01:34:46,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing that I just want to mention is in your folder.

1278
01:34:48,267 --> 01:34:54,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Susan Altman, who did the mural at the Roberts, also did a mural for the Family Network recently.

1279
01:34:55,011 --> 01:34:56,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Gorgeous, beautiful.

1280
01:34:56,452 --> 01:34:57,613
[SPEAKER_14]: When you get a chance, go take a look at it.

1281
01:34:57,633 --> 01:34:59,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we can't say she did the mural.

1282
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:00,715
[SPEAKER_14]: The kids did the mural.

1283
01:35:00,735 --> 01:35:03,136
[SPEAKER_08]: The families all put the mural together.

1284
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:06,058
[SPEAKER_14]: She guided the mural, and it was really terrific.

1285
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:11,782
[SPEAKER_14]: I saw it the other day, and really, it shows a transformation of, you know,

1286
01:35:12,548 --> 01:35:17,710
[SPEAKER_14]: How things work, how families work and transform themselves, how communities transform themselves.

1287
01:35:18,030 --> 01:35:25,672
[SPEAKER_14]: It's quite something to be seen and it will be displayed in the family network in this hole in the wall that they had.

1288
01:35:25,992 --> 01:35:27,372
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a hole in the wall project.

1289
01:35:29,986 --> 01:35:32,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus, you just received... And if I could, on Ms.

1290
01:35:32,187 --> 01:35:38,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Altman, we also have a display on the second floor staircase towards the Harvard Health side of the building.

1291
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:39,630
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a display that Ms.

1292
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:54,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Altman put together that's on our wall there, as well as a couple of others throughout the building, and they rotate monthly, so all you artists out there, students alike, if you'd like to petition to have a display, feel free, just contact the office and we're moving them monthly.

1293
01:35:55,737 --> 01:35:58,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And you also know that tomorrow the Curtis Tufts

1294
01:35:58,928 --> 01:35:59,428
[SPEAKER_14]: It's lunch.

1295
01:36:00,049 --> 01:36:06,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Starting at 11.30 for hors d'oeuvres and 12 o'clock for their annual dinner or luncheon, if you will.

1296
01:36:07,593 --> 01:36:09,434
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, you're all invited.

1297
01:36:11,916 --> 01:36:13,317
[SPEAKER_14]: The pep rally is on Wednesday.

1298
01:36:13,337 --> 01:36:14,897
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it starts at 11 o'clock.

1299
01:36:16,058 --> 01:36:16,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay?

1300
01:36:17,099 --> 01:36:20,881
[SPEAKER_14]: And, of course, on Thursday, we'll, of course, beat Malden.

1301
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:21,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, why wouldn't we?

1302
01:36:21,702 --> 01:36:22,282
[SPEAKER_08]: At Malden.

1303
01:36:22,402 --> 01:36:22,902
[SPEAKER_14]: At Malden.

1304
01:36:23,683 --> 01:36:25,664
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a couple of other papers that are on the agenda.

1305
01:36:25,704 --> 01:36:26,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we have some other papers, yeah.

1306
01:36:28,402 --> 01:36:28,922
[SPEAKER_08]: New business.

1307
01:36:29,002 --> 01:36:30,203
[SPEAKER_08]: School committee resolution.

1308
01:36:30,283 --> 01:36:35,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Manfredo Scaramuzzo.

1309
01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:39,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Scaramuzzo was the father of Rita DeCarlo, director of foreign languages.

1310
01:36:40,851 --> 01:36:47,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And also under suspension, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Denise Riley Bates.

1311
01:36:48,017 --> 01:36:48,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

1312
01:36:48,257 --> 01:36:51,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Bates was the mother of Medford High School hockey coach, Sean Bates.

1313
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:53,701
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1314
01:37:04,589 --> 01:37:04,889
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1315
01:37:06,331 --> 01:37:08,134
[SPEAKER_08]: I also just wanted to note a couple of dates.

1316
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:10,156
[SPEAKER_08]: This Saturday, the Jingle Bell Run.

1317
01:37:10,196 --> 01:37:14,362
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see that the trees are being set up as we speak, but Saturday is the Jingle Bell Run.

1318
01:37:14,863 --> 01:37:19,148
[SPEAKER_08]: And the proceeds go to the schools, the different various schools in the city of Medford.

1319
01:37:19,749 --> 01:37:22,052
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that takes place at the American Legion.

1320
01:37:23,113 --> 01:37:30,276
[SPEAKER_08]: November 30th City Hall, we're having our holiday glow where we'll be lighting up the building as well as turning on our trees and everything else.

1321
01:37:30,956 --> 01:37:33,758
[SPEAKER_08]: So please come on down, Wednesday evening, November 30th.

1322
01:37:34,418 --> 01:37:38,420
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the Jingle Bell Festival runs from November 30th on to December 4th.

1323
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:46,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So please come down, support the local charities that this great initiative goes toward, in particular the Buddy Cohalan Center for Alzheimer's.

1324
01:37:46,643 --> 01:37:48,824
[SPEAKER_08]: So please make sure you come on down.

1325
01:37:49,553 --> 01:37:54,857
[SPEAKER_08]: And also we want to wish everyone a very happy, peaceful Thanksgiving this Thursday.

1326
01:37:55,138 --> 01:37:55,258
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

1327
01:37:55,298 --> 01:37:55,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Van der Kloot.

1328
01:37:56,379 --> 01:38:00,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Mayor, can I just ask for a clarification on the time on Wednesday?

1329
01:38:00,102 --> 01:38:02,804
[SPEAKER_11]: What time does it begin and what time do you... I believe it's 4.30.

1330
01:38:03,124 --> 01:38:04,806
[SPEAKER_11]: And what, how long do you expect it to run?

1331
01:38:04,926 --> 01:38:05,586
[SPEAKER_11]: It will go till 7.

1332
01:38:05,806 --> 01:38:15,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Thursday night there will be a vigil from the Grace Church to City Hall for overcoming addiction.

1333
01:38:17,277 --> 01:38:22,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Friday night, the scouts, girls and boys, will be down having an event here as well.

1334
01:38:22,339 --> 01:38:27,202
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're trying to increase participation each of the nights during the Jingle Bell Festival.

1335
01:38:27,482 --> 01:38:29,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And so hopefully you'll have a chance to come on down.

1336
01:38:30,243 --> 01:38:32,324
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure it will look much different next time you see it.

1337
01:38:33,645 --> 01:38:33,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Any others?

1338
01:38:34,305 --> 01:38:34,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

1339
01:38:34,445 --> 01:38:34,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Puno.

1340
01:38:35,165 --> 01:38:42,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to just piggyback on the letter that the superintendent put out to everyone and also to

1341
01:38:45,512 --> 01:38:52,238
[SPEAKER_04]: I was listening to something today and it really dawned on, there's been a lot going on.

1342
01:38:53,279 --> 01:39:01,186
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to get into politics actually, I'm actually asking people to put politics aside on Thursday and

1343
01:39:02,628 --> 01:39:06,531
[SPEAKER_04]: have your family together, enjoy family, enjoy that time.

1344
01:39:06,772 --> 01:39:16,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard so many crazy things from me that people are trying to avoid other people, are not inviting other people, and you know what?

1345
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:29,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Political life aside and everything else really take part of Thanksgiving and I'm asking everyone just to have a safe, happy Thanksgiving and just really put the political agenda aside because

1346
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:32,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing changes the way you are.

1347
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing changes our ethics as people.

1348
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:40,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing changes the morals that we have, the way we raise our children.

1349
01:39:41,242 --> 01:39:45,703
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was my thing for wishing everyone and really thinking about it.

1350
01:39:47,463 --> 01:39:50,464
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last item on the agenda, negotiations and legal matters.

1351
01:39:50,544 --> 01:39:52,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to go into executive session?

1352
01:39:52,865 --> 01:39:53,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion.

1353
01:39:53,885 --> 01:39:55,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Mr. Skerry.

1354
01:39:55,265 --> 01:39:56,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call vote, please.

1355
01:39:57,186 --> 01:39:57,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1356
01:40:01,075 --> 01:40:07,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one absent, motion is approved and we will adjourn after executive session.
