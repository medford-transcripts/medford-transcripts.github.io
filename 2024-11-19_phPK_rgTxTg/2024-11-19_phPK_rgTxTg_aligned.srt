00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:40,665
22-585 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

23
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:48,927
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council invite the Medford High School head football coach and players to the next city council meeting in recognition of their outstanding community outreach.

24
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:49,808
Councilor Scarpelli.

25
00:00:51,388 --> 00:00:52,448
Thank you, Madam President.

26
00:00:53,009 --> 00:01:02,832
I know that it was a resolution that I put forth that I appreciated all of the

27
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:13,385
you know, talk and discussions around the Thanksgiving Day football game and being Fenway Park and how important that was and how we could, you know, the recognition of a football game.

28
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:17,568
But I think what's more important that had to be addressed.

29
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:29,257
And I think that our young people have to see that committees like this council and more recognize what these young men and women do

30
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:32,819
and coaches do for the community.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:51,416
I would love that we could ask the Meffitt High School football team and coaching staff to appear to the city council and we make a motion that if we can have citations made and just to recognize what they've done.

32
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:53,698
And what I'm trying to say is you have

33
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:59,848
a program just a few short years ago that almost didn't have enough kids for one team.

34
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,595
And now they're close to 60 to 70 kids that are playing on the team.

35
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,740
That being so important because you're seeing kids.

36
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:14,045
And from what I gather, it's a lot of kids that are

37
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:22,649
Not the don't have the support that that most kids have in their families so leaning on each other.

38
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,650
I think it's something that's so important.

39
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,451
It's such a great tool to have a team like the high school football team.

40
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:31,373
But what you realize is what they're doing in our community.

41
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:34,326
and giving back to the community.

42
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:37,748
We forget about wins and losses, forget about all that, throw that all away.

43
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:56,097
But when you have a leader like John Curley, the football coach, who's going out with his team and help organizing and running National Night Out, the whole football team showing up and working with the police department to organize a National Night Out event or in September where they helped the senior citizens

44
00:02:56,637 --> 00:03:16,244
clean out their basements or in October, when they helped with this in support of the unified basketball program, where they're, they're, they're boys and girls dressed up and mascots and supported in support of the team in November, again helping with the unified football Thanksgiving Day game, and then

45
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:23,149
What I thought really struck me was a neighbor called and says, well, the football team is coming out to rake our leaves.

46
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:25,290
And I said, yeah, right.

47
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,871
No, but that's what they were doing.

48
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:36,218
They went out to neighbors that couldn't rake their leaves and were stuck in the house and the football team came out and rake their leaves.

49
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:41,181
And I know that they're actually going to be

50
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:46,427
they're doing a gift certificate drive to support the Meffitt family connection.

51
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,709
So it's important that people hear this and why?

52
00:03:50,249 --> 00:04:00,154
Because you hear so many negative things now, especially what's going on in the last couple of months at Medford High School and everything you hear in TV and how negative things are.

53
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:05,377
But we're lucky because we do have a lot of very good kids at Medford High School.

54
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:10,820
And looking at the football team and the leadership from the coach, John Curley, and what they've done,

55
00:04:12,946 --> 00:04:15,288
I don't mind that you're not winning the Super Bowl.

56
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:16,368
It's okay for me.

57
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:25,975
I love the idea that we can read these stories and talk to neighbors and talk to senior citizens, how the football team has come out and helped this community and given back.

58
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:31,859
And it was funny last night, I talked to a teacher and they said, Hey, you, you have something on the agenda for the football team.

59
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,980
And the coach said, yeah, I just wanted to thank him.

60
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,124
And he said to me, um, I had an issue with one of the players and I just wasn't getting to him.

61
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:42,466
So I contacted coach Curly and

62
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:51,775
Coach Curley, during his lunchtime, went to Medford High School, and when this young man sat down in a seat, his football coach sat behind him.

63
00:04:53,517 --> 00:04:57,121
And it was funny because I said, well, that's a scare tactic as a joke.

64
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:58,762
And he said it was total opposite.

65
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:06,170
What that young man felt, because their football coach cared enough that he would take his lunch and sit behind him,

66
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:19,060
and at the end of the class, have a dialogue to make sure that both the teacher and the football coach is in this working together to make sure they achieve their highest capability possible.

67
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:21,901
And to me, I think that speaks volumes.

68
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:30,323
So I really want Coach Curley and the football team to be here and to be recognized and given a citation so they can understand that

69
00:05:31,103 --> 00:05:44,527
We see this people see this, and this can be just as contagious as the bad things, the negative talk you hear, but when you see teams like this and you see coaches like this lead lead lead our young people, you know, in the positive light.

70
00:05:45,668 --> 00:05:47,831
This is what our community is built on.

71
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:49,352
This is what makes Medford, Medford.

72
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,095
And this is what Mustang Pride is all about.

73
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:58,563
If anybody thinks that Mustang Pride is about putting on a football helmet and running through a tornado, that means nothing.

74
00:05:59,164 --> 00:06:01,447
To be a Mustang, to have Mustang Pride, this is what it's about.

75
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:05,312
Giving back to the community, understanding that there's something bigger than you.

76
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:11,581
And I want to just make sure that we commend our coaching staff, especially Coach Curley.

77
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:18,104
I know that the football association under Chris Murphy is his leadership.

78
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:25,528
I think that that whole association should be recognized and I would make that a formal motion to invite them next week to the meeting.

79
00:06:25,768 --> 00:06:26,609
Thank you, Madam President.

80
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:27,787
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

81
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,268
Councilor Carvalho.

82
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:30,069
Thank you, Madam President.

83
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:33,730
Again, I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this forward.

84
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:34,771
He's right.

85
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:38,553
Mustang Pride means pride in your community.

86
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:45,556
And there's five of us here that are graduates from this school there, and we all know what Mustang Pride is.

87
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,918
It's not about wins and losses.

88
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:54,201
It's about camaraderie, about team spirit, and it's about being a part of your community and making your school proud.

89
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:56,582
And that's how we all grew up with.

90
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:02,073
with the sports for our sports and education all go hand in hand.

91
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:10,476
And I just wanna thank the coach for doing a great job with the kids, getting them out there in the community and helping them develop community pride and school pride.

92
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:11,976
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

93
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,476
Any further discussion from the council?

94
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:18,017
I do see Chris Murphy with his hand up.

95
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:20,038
Hi.

96
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,459
Name and address for the record, please.

97
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:23,479
Can you hear me?

98
00:07:25,722 --> 00:07:29,104
All right, Chris Murphy 51 shirt now.

99
00:07:30,104 --> 00:07:35,588
I'm the president of the team, the Football Associates Booster Club.

100
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,190
You're coming through a little warble, Chris.

101
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:46,714
Can you hear me now?

102
00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:46,914
Yes.

103
00:07:53,618 --> 00:07:56,619
Yeah, if you want to turn off your video, that sometimes helps as far as connection issues.

104
00:07:57,499 --> 00:08:02,101
Hold on one second.

105
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,322
Is that better?

106
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:07,482
Yes, that's better.

107
00:08:07,502 --> 00:08:07,842
That better?

108
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:09,523
Yep, that's better.

109
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:17,826
I just want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on and for giving these kids the recognition for doing this.

110
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:22,547
One of the things that John Curley,

111
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:29,416
you know, said to me when he first took this job is trying to make these kids, you know, they're going to be good students.

112
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:31,919
They're going to be good athletes, but they're going to be better citizens.

113
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:40,706
And over the last four years, the amount of stuff that these kids have done and have gotten to, you know, into the community is, is been outstanding.

114
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:48,013
Um, I wish I could take credit for some of it, but I can't, um, this has been 100% coach curly.

115
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:48,113
Um,

116
00:08:51,117 --> 00:08:55,540
You know, I get texts all the time from him saying, you know, I had this idea.

117
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,180
Can we do this?

118
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,720
Can we do that?

119
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,321
Can we do that?

120
00:08:57,401 --> 00:09:02,844
You know, right now we're doing a gift card drive for the Metric Family Network for the high school and middle school students.

121
00:09:03,524 --> 00:09:09,147
We have drop-off boxes at the rink and the high school athletic office.

122
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:18,573
I just wanted to plug that real quick, but I can't thank you guys enough for giving these kids and Coach Curley

123
00:09:20,588 --> 00:09:21,609
the recognition for this.

124
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:32,514
And, you know, I know our wins and losses have been great, but one thing, you know, Mustang Nation can take pride in is that these kids are becoming great citizens and great parts of this community.

125
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:34,055
So I thank you guys again.

126
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,717
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

And we also wanted to continue this public hearing so that any members of public who wish to speak in person or on Zoom had a chance to in regards to voting on the tax, setting the tax, different elements of the tax.

159
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:54,666
Great.

160
00:11:55,587 --> 00:11:55,967
Councilor Knight.

161
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:58,589
I motion to adopt the lowest residential tax amendment present.

162
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:00,931
So I just want to read.

163
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,917
Director Dickinson, do you have anything you'd like to add?

164
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:06,858
I was playing up these slides.

165
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:11,721
No, I'm just here to answer questions, should they come up if I can.

166
00:12:12,301 --> 00:12:15,182
I can share my screen too, if that's helpful.

167
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:17,523
This is the last slide from... Great.

168
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:29,564
This is the last slide.

169
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:38,569
So we have a vote for us for selection, minimum residential factor, vote on whether to adopt a residential exemption, and vote on whether to adopt a small commercial exemption.

170
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:46,774
So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to adopt the- Lowest residential factor.

171
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,095
Lowest residential factor.

172
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,515
Mayor Snider.

173
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:52,697
Just for clarity, seek to amend it to adopt a minimum residential factor of 91.43.

174
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:58,673
So the motion is to adopt a residential factor of 91.43, correct Councilor Knight?

175
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,254
That's what the lowest residential factor may be.

176
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:04,094
That's what it may be.

177
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:07,134
That's what it's delivered to us.

178
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:11,115
Okay, so there's a motion from Councilor Knight.

179
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:18,577
I also have a motion from Councilor Knight to adopt the lowest residential factor, so a factor of 91.43.

180
00:13:21,296 --> 00:13:21,796
Yep, yeah.

181
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:24,017
Okay.

182
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:27,859
So on the motion, Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

183
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,680
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

184
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:35,622
To adopt the residential factor, 91.43.

185
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:36,563
Vice President Behrs?

186
00:13:36,603 --> 00:13:36,863
Yes.

187
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:38,543
Councilor Carviello?

188
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:38,964
Yes.

189
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:40,424
Councilor Collins?

190
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:40,724
Yes.

191
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:41,605
Councilor Knight?

192
00:13:41,685 --> 00:13:41,945
Yes.

193
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:43,145
Councilor Scarpelli?

194
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:43,606
Yes.

195
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:44,466
Councilor Sanz?

196
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:47,547
Yes, sorry.

197
00:13:47,567 --> 00:13:48,568
Vice President Morrell?

198
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:49,028
Yes.

199
00:13:49,744 --> 00:13:51,725
So I mean, the affirmative is here and the negative, the motion passes.

200
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,866
So we have a vote on whether or not to adopt a residential exemption.

201
00:13:57,826 --> 00:14:00,427
The motion is not to adopt a residential exemption.

202
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:03,628
On a motion of, would you like to speak, Mr. Castaneda?

203
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:06,708
This is the time before we actually vote.

204
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:07,809
Before we actually vote.

205
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:08,869
A residential exemption.

206
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,530
Thank you.

207
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:24,390
I'm Andrew Castaneda, Cushman Street, East Medford.

208
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,252
Today's December 6th, 2022.

209
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:33,918
Greetings to the city councilors and Mayor Brianna.

210
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:49,171
I'm here again, and I'm still disappointed that you and the mayor never adopted the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption named Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Section 5C.

211
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:52,343
here in Medford.

212
00:14:53,964 --> 00:15:14,628
As was done in Boston, Cambridge, Chelsea, Malden, and our neighbor next to you in Somerville, which is saving the owner-occupied homeowner an average of $3,000 a year each off their real estate tax bill.

213
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,949
So in closing,

214
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:26,141
I simply ask, and you all, why not give us this Massachusetts static perk here in 02155?

215
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:41,582
nine times that I've taken this vote.

216
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:48,103
Ultimately, when we adopt a residential tax exemption, all we're doing is we're still taxing the same amount of money.

217
00:15:48,843 --> 00:15:51,624
All we're doing is shifting who are asking to give us that money.

218
00:15:52,344 --> 00:16:02,066
And based upon the analysis of our city assessor, the city assessor has shown that the break-even point would make more people actually pay more in taxes than those that would receive a break.

219
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:05,727
So it didn't make sense mathematically for us to do this.

220
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:14,926
there'd be more people in the community that were seeing their tax bills actually increase, not decrease, based upon the assessment that was performed by our assessor.

221
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:16,427
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

222
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:17,347
Vice-President Behrs.

223
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:18,407
Thank you, Madam President.

224
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:27,250
Mr. Castaneda, I personally think that this should be an option that we consider when we look at the tax structure in the city.

225
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:33,292
I don't agree with Councilor Knight in the sense that the numbers that were presented by

226
00:16:34,488 --> 00:16:38,589
Assessor Bordeaux where that yes, there are a number of people, a number of households.

227
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,129
If you could shut off your microphone just for a moment, there's an echo.

228
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:49,111
Or maybe Shane can.

229
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:55,752
There certainly are a number of people who would pay more if we were to implement a residential exemption, but that number was lower than the number of people who would benefit.

230
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:59,572
The conversation of course, is that there are people who would benefit and people who would pay.

231
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:02,333
And that's an important conversation to have

232
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:04,599
obviously, and a difficult decision to make.

233
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:14,487
It's my personal belief that asking owners of high value homes to pay more and owners of lower value homes to pay less may well be a good policy decision for the city to make.

234
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:22,333
It's the one way that we can adjust our currently flat property tax rate to potentially add some fairness.

235
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:27,077
However, the main concern that the assessor brought up was

236
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:30,779
that we would need a lot of time to implement this.

237
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,102
And we hadn't had the discussions in time to implement it.

238
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:36,764
So I certainly think it should be a piece of the puzzle going forward.

239
00:17:37,185 --> 00:17:37,465
Thank you.

240
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:58,837
I was just going to mention, I think last week the interim chief inspector also mentioned that this would not be the right time to adopt it because of the logistics associated with it, but that if we do choose to adopt it, we should have a conversation early next year about it.

241
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:00,078
Exactly.

242
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:03,099
The council did meet in August to discuss this with interim chief inspector Bordeaux.

243
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,461
I would hope that we have a resolution to have that discussion.

244
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:15,235
Now, one second.

245
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,538
Shane, can you help out here?

246
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,460
Sorry.

247
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,344
I got text saying that when you share, when we're sharing on Zoom, that it's not showing anyone.

248
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:29,185
All right, I can't.

249
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,707
Can you remove this person?

250
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,028
I can't, they keep on moving.

251
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:36,450
Okay, Ronald Miller.

252
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,392
Let's check that person, sorry.

253
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:40,453
All right, I got it.

254
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:42,655
Sorry, the square kept moving.

255
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:43,600
All right.

256
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,541
Sorry about that.

257
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:46,022
Okay.

258
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:49,945
So yes, we did meet.

259
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:58,833
I would hope, I would entertain, I would hope a council would submit a resolution to once again, have that meeting either in the spring or the summer to see where we stand with the ability to adopt this.

260
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:03,717
I, like bison and bears, I do see this as a powerful potential option for our community.

261
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:04,878
Just want to make sure we're doing it right.

262
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:10,883
And I think there is also something to be said that I very much appreciate the work of interim assessor,

263
00:19:11,523 --> 00:19:18,128
Bordeaux, but also I think just the title alone suggests we might not have the bandwidth to do something that is quite a large overhaul at this point.

264
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:20,090
So you're heard.

265
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,530
Absolutely.

266
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,451
And I appreciate it.

267
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:23,022
I can't.

268
00:19:23,342 --> 00:19:23,903
Anything else?

269
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:28,345
No, I think if I can.

270
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,526
I know that Council night.

271
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:35,330
That's exactly what I heard from our assessor and the understanding that in theory, it sounds great.

272
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,952
Uh, where if you want your home, you'll get you'll get tax exempt.

273
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:43,955
That's not the way the way that it's been been, uh, uh,

274
00:19:45,256 --> 00:20:03,224
told to us that something that this council, especially some members of the council push for the understanding of keeping people in Medford when you're going to see how higher priced homes, which is a lot of times our three family homes, we want to keep people in Medford.

275
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:10,868
And what I was told that as you're looking at those people that most landlords aren't going to say, you know what?

276
00:20:13,009 --> 00:20:13,709
We'll take the hit.

277
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:18,241
My taxes are going to go up, but I'm going to take that hit.

278
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:19,263
That's not going to happen.

279
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:21,628
We want people to still afford to live in Metro.

280
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:23,351
What's going to happen is, again,

281
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:29,821
the landlord's gonna put it back on the renter, and affordable housing even gets deeper and deeper.

282
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:41,188
So these are the reasons why that I'm gonna support the vote that I've taken since we've been here, and what our acting assessor has told us.

283
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:48,473
It's not as simple as the wording of, you're on your home, you're,

284
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,623
you're going to be exempt from the taxes.

285
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:51,224
That's not true.

286
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:57,968
So I think that you still have to understand where that money's coming from and who's going to take that.

287
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:04,593
And I think it's just it just hurts our community if we approve that in totality.

288
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:05,434
But thank you.

289
00:21:06,094 --> 00:21:06,615
Thank you.

290
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,655
Any further discussion?

291
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:10,377
Just one thing I'd like to point out, Madam President.

292
00:21:11,057 --> 00:21:13,379
In looking at the presentation that Ms.

293
00:21:13,499 --> 00:21:25,910
Bordeaux put on back in August of this year, she did note that at a 20% owner-occupied exemption, the break-even point would be any home valued at $707,000 would be the break-even.

294
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:36,406
And the only value over that would be receiving an incremental tax increase.

295
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:40,287
It looks like for every 90,000 dollars, it goes up about 200 bucks.

296
00:21:40,347 --> 00:21:41,568
Then the next 90,000, it goes up about 400 bucks.

297
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:42,808
The next 90,000, it goes up about 800 bucks.

298
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:44,609
The next 90,000, it goes up about 1600 bucks.

299
00:21:44,629 --> 00:21:44,889
The next 90,000.

300
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,391
It goes up up there to 200 bucks.

301
00:21:49,951 --> 00:22:02,898
So if you look at a property let's say like 23 pushing street down here in the city of Medfield which is assessed at $803,000 right now that home actually wouldn't even meet the requirements for the break even point that home would actually pay more in taxes than we pay without the exemption.

302
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,019
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

303
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,761
I appreciate Mr Castanets selfless advocacy.

304
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:12,023
So what appreciate your selfless advocacy I mean,

305
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:15,346
The median average median home value in the city is below $707,000.

306
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:16,746
More people would benefit than would pay.

307
00:22:44,083 --> 00:22:54,831
the 85% of the home occupied would receive savings instead of the usual 4% increases, which happens by clockwork instead of prop two and a half.

308
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:57,893
It's more like four or 5%, especially with my two family.

309
00:22:58,233 --> 00:22:59,414
And yes, I would see an increase.

310
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:02,857
So I'm not here to save money for me, it would cost me.

311
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:08,241
But 85% of the people are gonna save.

312
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:12,080
instead of the usual 4% tax.

313
00:23:12,921 --> 00:23:24,608
Also, if it's such a bad program, why is all these communities, especially some of them with a maximum of 35% shift exemption, why are they still in the program?

314
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:25,889
They can drop out anytime.

315
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,270
So could we, if we got in.

316
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:32,274
And also, I don't wanna see anyone's bills go up personally.

317
00:23:32,534 --> 00:23:35,516
I think the tax man gets more than their fair share.

318
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,777
It just never ends.

319
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:38,838
If you wanna help,

320
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:48,999
the renters, I suggest you all talk to your president in Washington DC to get them to reverse the energy situation.

321
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,983
Because I've never seen this inflation since when Jimmy Carter was there in the 70s.

322
00:23:54,103 --> 00:23:57,846
And we had gas lines to buy gasoline for our vehicles.

323
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:06,734
And if it's so complicated, it can't be rocket science if all these communities are doing it.

324
00:24:07,774 --> 00:24:12,537
Boston, I missed Everett, Chelsea, Cambridge.

325
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:14,838
It started in Nantucket originally.

326
00:24:16,199 --> 00:24:19,661
And the formula is defective, I'll agree.

327
00:24:20,282 --> 00:24:24,364
It should not be a cutoff point of $700,000 or whatever.

328
00:24:25,525 --> 00:24:36,572
It should be rewritten at the state house that take the exemption amount of that tax swing at 35%, for example, it should be even dollars

329
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:40,158
for every owner occupied one set amount.

330
00:24:40,718 --> 00:24:42,518
It can't be that hard to do the mathematics.

331
00:24:42,578 --> 00:24:49,959
Instead of someone saving 2,000, which is not right, which will happen in the Heights more than downtown.

332
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:56,480
It should be one set figure, probably $700 it might come out to for every single owner occupied.

333
00:24:57,541 --> 00:24:58,321
I rest my case.

334
00:24:59,001 --> 00:24:59,941
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

335
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:04,482
So on the motion of vice president Behrs to vote against

336
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:07,356
the residential exemption.

337
00:25:08,396 --> 00:25:09,197
Do not adopt.

338
00:25:10,818 --> 00:25:14,821
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

339
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:15,861
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

340
00:25:17,503 --> 00:25:17,623
Yes.

341
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:17,803
Yes.

342
00:25:17,843 --> 00:25:18,443
Correct.

343
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:22,306
affirmative vote means to not adopt.

344
00:25:22,346 --> 00:25:24,307
Vice President Behrs.

345
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:24,647
Yes.

346
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:38,287
Councilor Kerrio?

347
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:38,608
Yes.

348
00:25:39,468 --> 00:25:40,088
Councilor Collins?

349
00:25:40,348 --> 00:25:40,569
Yes.

350
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:42,570
Councilor Knight?

351
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,950
Yes.

352
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,190
Councilor Scarpelli?

353
00:25:44,431 --> 00:25:44,611
Yes.

354
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:45,951
Councilor Sang?

355
00:25:46,071 --> 00:25:46,292
Yes.

356
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:47,372
President Morrell?

357
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:48,153
Yes.

358
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,134
Signing affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

359
00:25:51,955 --> 00:25:59,038
And then the last vote we have is to whether or not to select a small commercial exemption, which historically the council has not adopted.

360
00:25:59,058 --> 00:25:59,799
Two more votes.

361
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,480
Motion to- Oh, we have the open space.

362
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:03,961
Sorry.

363
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:07,289
It's just going to move to not adopt a small commercial exemption.

364
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:13,472
So on the motion of vice president bears not adopt the small commercial exemption seconded by Councilor Knight.

365
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,914
Councilor Collins, do you want to speak?

366
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,375
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

367
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:28,238
Is there a second on that?

368
00:26:28,258 --> 00:26:28,918
Yes, Councilor Knight.

369
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:42,780
Okay.

370
00:26:44,741 --> 00:26:45,422
Vice President bears.

371
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:45,762
Yes.

372
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:47,023
Councilor Carribello.

373
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:48,124
Councilor Collins.

374
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:48,404
Yes.

375
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:49,666
Councilor Knight.

376
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:50,046
Yes.

377
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:51,287
Councilor Scarpelli.

378
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:51,547
Yes.

379
00:26:52,148 --> 00:26:52,668
Councilor Seng.

380
00:26:52,728 --> 00:26:52,928
Yes.

381
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:53,789
President Morrell.

382
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:54,149
Yes.

383
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:56,171
So the informant is there and then I get the motion passes.

384
00:26:56,831 --> 00:27:03,537
And then we just have to vote whether or not to select or yeah, adopt an open space discount.

385
00:27:04,638 --> 00:27:05,498
Motion to not adopt.

386
00:27:06,199 --> 00:27:10,360
On the motion of Councilor Knight to not adopt an open space discount.

387
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,201
Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

388
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:14,822
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

389
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:25,506
Vice President Paris.

390
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:25,806
Yes.

391
00:27:26,307 --> 00:27:26,787
Councilor Kerrio.

392
00:27:28,212 --> 00:27:28,772
Councilor Collins?

393
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:29,152
Yes.

394
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:30,413
Councilor Knight?

395
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:30,893
Yes.

396
00:27:31,193 --> 00:27:31,873
Councilor Scarpelli?

397
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:32,293
Yes.

398
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:33,054
Councilor Sang?

399
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:33,334
Yes.

400
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:34,234
President Morrell?

401
00:27:34,494 --> 00:27:34,674
Yes.

402
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,675
The affirmative is there and the negative motion passes.

403
00:27:39,656 --> 00:27:44,077
Motions, orders and resolutions 22-578 offered by Councilor Carviello.

404
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:52,260
Be it so resolved the Medford City Council have our DPW director and city engineer appear before the council and discuss the substandard paving on Winthrop Street by Eversource.

405
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,040
Councilor Carviello?

406
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:08,063
I mean, this is, Eversource has been in the city, what, five years, six years?

407
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:17,487
Been here so long on their project, tearing the streets up and down, and this is our one chance to get one of the biggest streets in our city paved on someone else's dime.

408
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,449
And I would think at the least, we can get it done correctly.

409
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:27,852
If you're driven by there, you can see there's different levels, the sewer covers are sinking, the lines are everywhere.

410
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:30,368
Drive down the street to Winchester.

411
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:32,029
You don't see the seams breaking.

412
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:38,092
You don't see a different company doing it down in Winchester versus McCourt, who's doing it in our city.

413
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:41,514
There's patchwork.

414
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:52,180
It's just not what should be expected for whatever sort of step this community, for the last five years, for a community that got no benefit out of that project.

415
00:28:54,743 --> 00:29:01,746
I know we have the city engineer tonight, and if you'd like to address those issues, but if the city signs off on that paving, then shame on us.

416
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:03,587
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

417
00:29:03,607 --> 00:29:07,509
We also do have Todd Lamb from Eversource on the call, who I believe has a presentation.

418
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:12,551
If any Councilors would like to speak first, or if you'd like to hear from Councilors.

419
00:29:17,045 --> 00:29:18,446
Todd, you should be able to.

420
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,027
I'm sorry, go ahead.

421
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:21,327
I'm tired of hearing from Eversource.

422
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:22,388
I want this done.

423
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:23,408
I just want it to be over.

424
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:27,130
Literally, Eversource came in this community my first term in office.

425
00:29:28,451 --> 00:29:30,032
This is my fifth term.

426
00:29:30,532 --> 00:29:31,513
It's nine years.

427
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,654
It just needs to be over.

428
00:29:34,014 --> 00:29:34,915
It just needs to be over.

429
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,215
These people need relief in this neighborhood.

430
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:38,297
Thank you, Councilor Nye.

431
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:42,979
Todd Lanham from Eversource.

432
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:44,780
Are you there?

433
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:46,541
There we go.

434
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,071
Yes, there are several folks here from Eversource.

435
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:54,034
Bob Coates and Tim Reveille, I believe, are here as well.

436
00:29:55,855 --> 00:30:00,897
Do you have a presentation or are you just available to answer questions?

437
00:30:02,318 --> 00:30:06,180
I think we're going to be here to answer any questions that may come from the discussion tonight.

438
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:07,321
Okay.

439
00:30:07,881 --> 00:30:14,505
Madam President, can I ask where the person who was paid by Eversource to oversee this project is and who it is?

440
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:17,923
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

441
00:30:18,063 --> 00:30:27,588
I don't know, because I recall when they came in, they were gonna pay for a person to oversee the project for the city of Meffitt.

442
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:33,271
Who is this person, and where is he, or he, or she, or whoever's there?

443
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:43,037
I haven't seen anybody, and I say, any person that's maybe a clerk of the works, or whatever you wanna call it, that thinks that's a good job there, then I say,

444
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:47,020
I wouldn't pay for that on my driveway.

445
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,022
And also, Eversource was supposed to pay $50,000 to a sidewalk.

446
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:54,403
I see there is some sidewalk there.

447
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:59,965
I don't know if that was the whole scope of the $50,000 worth of work for the sidewalk on Lorain Road in that area.

448
00:31:01,086 --> 00:31:05,628
But I wanna know where the person is that was paid by Eversource for this project.

449
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:07,269
Thank you, Councilor Carvell.

450
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:09,890
Todd, is that something you can answer?

451
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,791
Can I ask that Mr. Bobcoats be unmuted?

452
00:31:12,891 --> 00:31:14,952
He will be glad to provide some comments this evening.

453
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,420
We could get Bob coach.

454
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,742
I think he was last name only.

455
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:22,623
Is it coders?

456
00:31:24,104 --> 00:31:26,525
Yeah, I think that's a typo, but yes.

457
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,788
We get Bob to come off video as well.

458
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:35,269
I think we might be able to hang on a second.

459
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:36,670
I gotta thank you.

460
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:38,631
My apologies.

461
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,173
You should be able to start video now.

462
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:52,227
Thank you.

463
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:52,688
Good evening.

464
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:56,848
I'm Bob Coates, vice president of major projects and capital construction for Eversource.

465
00:31:57,689 --> 00:32:00,609
Thank you to the council to be present tonight.

466
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:04,210
I presented back in the spring and said we would come back in the fall.

467
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,931
To answer the question specifically, we do have people assigned to the project full time.

468
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,292
There's a person that is assigned and a project manager assigned.

469
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:18,973
And we've been continuing to work collaboratively with the city departments.

470
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:25,134
to affect positive change in this project, which we have demonstrated in the last six months.

471
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,295
We are actually ahead of schedule.

472
00:32:27,315 --> 00:32:37,318
We're actually ahead of schedule and continuing to make great progress.

473
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:45,801
With respect to the paving on Winthrop Street, it does meet the mass DOT specs.

474
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:48,102
The seams were a little different.

475
00:32:49,062 --> 00:32:56,186
based upon the traffic patterns that had to be maintained while we were paving, and we will stand behind, obviously, that paving.

476
00:32:56,646 --> 00:33:03,970
There were some castings that needed to be addressed with the sister utility that couldn't address those, and we will be making those corrections as well.

477
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,611
So we continue to make great progress.

478
00:33:06,731 --> 00:33:10,033
I understand and empathize with the frustrations of the city.

479
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:14,395
It's been a long project, but we've implemented many strategies.

480
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:15,576
I want to personally thank

481
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,563
the city engineer, Mr. Wartella, for his leadership over the last six months, we've been able to make some great progress.

482
00:33:22,263 --> 00:33:31,930
I realize that it doesn't resolve the last several years, but it's a commitment I made to this council when I spoke to you in the spring that this is what we do and this is what we have done.

483
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,173
Thank you.

484
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:41,757
Well, Madam President, I'm glad you're making great progress, but you're not making great progress with quality work.

485
00:33:42,758 --> 00:33:45,460
Sorry, I wouldn't accept that for my own driveway at my house.

486
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:50,746
Go by there and look at the road, and you'll see it's at different heights.

487
00:33:51,126 --> 00:33:52,286
The seams are coming apart.

488
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:54,887
There's patchwork on different parts.

489
00:33:55,387 --> 00:34:02,048
This is not what this community has had 10 years of disruption for, for you guys to do a lousy job.

490
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:05,889
Drive down the street a half a mile into Winchester and look at the difference.

491
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:08,849
What's the difference between Winchester and Medford?

492
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:13,130
I want the same quality that they did over there, not in our city.

493
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:21,189
If a court can't do the job, you bring middle sex in here and let them pay the same way they paid down there.

494
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,591
This is not fair.

495
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:25,492
This is a major thoroughfare.

496
00:34:25,832 --> 00:34:29,235
It's not even going to last a year before it starts coming up.

497
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:33,478
That's not acceptable to me.

498
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:36,099
It shouldn't be acceptable to anybody in this community.

499
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,641
Thank you, Councilor Cabello.

500
00:34:40,997 --> 00:34:42,978
Councilor, would you like to speak?

501
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,482
If I can, to address a question to Mr. Coates, is this the final paving?

502
00:34:50,243 --> 00:34:52,985
The paving that's done on Winthrop Street will be the final paving.

503
00:34:53,005 --> 00:34:54,626
The striping's not the final striping.

504
00:34:55,167 --> 00:34:56,688
That's done as a temporary striping.

505
00:34:56,988 --> 00:35:02,832
There's inlaid epoxy paint striping that will have to be done in the spring due to weather freezing considerations.

506
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:05,233
Okay, so, and yeah,

507
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:17,991
In your professional opinion, what we're seeing on the method side with the patchwork, with the manholes that are sunk in, is that acceptable?

508
00:35:18,811 --> 00:35:26,536
The manholes, as I said, will be addressed that we've discussed, and the paving meets the DOT standards and spec.

509
00:35:27,036 --> 00:35:35,402
I realize that there's some seams that were applied that we've discussed with Mr. Witella, and they will be

510
00:35:36,362 --> 00:35:42,866
Um, verified to be safe and sound for the time period for that time period.

511
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:48,329
So we appreciate you being the person that we're addressing this to.

512
00:35:48,349 --> 00:36:01,777
But I think you have to understand the horror that these neighbors have gone through and just the idea when they see the work that's not up to par and the idea that maybe in the next six months,

513
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:10,433
that they could have machinery again, going up and down that corridor, fixing a mistake that we'll be talking about tonight.

514
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:11,714
I hope you understand that.

515
00:36:13,414 --> 00:36:22,678
I think my last question really is, what's acceptable for standards?

516
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:33,247
but the difference between what we see in Winchester and the difference that we see as soon as you cross the line in Medford, do you recognize that?

517
00:36:37,129 --> 00:36:47,877
We apply the paving to the standards that we are ordered to by the city and the state.

518
00:36:49,518 --> 00:36:51,019
I do recognize that the

519
00:36:52,026 --> 00:36:55,229
Paving and the optics look different in the two areas.

520
00:36:55,809 --> 00:37:01,334
The cities operate with different rules and procedures to execute those activities.

521
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,936
So this is our fault, so our standards are lower?

522
00:37:05,777 --> 00:37:07,859
Didn't say that, sir, at all.

523
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,180
Oh, you did say that.

524
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,363
What you said was that the standards in that community are different than ours.

525
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,325
That's exactly what you said.

526
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:21,370
So my question is, being the professional, the standards that's allowed in Winchester

527
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:25,054
wouldn't be allowed what we have in Medford in that act.

528
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:27,096
So let me clarify my statement.

529
00:37:27,116 --> 00:37:28,937
I'm not saying that the standards are different.

530
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,838
I'm saying the means and methods are different.

531
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:36,603
We can pave at night in different communities.

532
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:39,325
We're not able, weren't able to do that with the traffic concerns.

533
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,107
We can pave by shutting down roads.

534
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:48,752
So we operated in Medford in accordance with the directions provided us by the city departments.

535
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,123
And we do have people on site to monitor the quality of that construction.

536
00:37:55,724 --> 00:38:01,128
So if I can ask our engineer while you're on the phone, while you're here in this presentation, if we can.

537
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:18,482
So from what I'm hearing, the reason why we have patchy work and that we feel that it's subpar, it's because, not you per se, but we Medford told Eversource to pave it that way, piecemeal like that, because that's what I'm hearing.

538
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:24,541
Thank you.

539
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:24,982
Hi.

540
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,523
Owen Wirtala, City Engineer.

541
00:38:28,565 --> 00:38:35,750
I believe what's trying to be conveyed here is the fact that in Winchester, they shut down the whole road, so they were able to get a nice, warm scene.

542
00:38:36,611 --> 00:38:47,139
And what happened in Medford was because we had to keep both two lanes of travel, the scene was a little colder, so it doesn't mesh as well.

543
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,620
It's just cosmetic only.

544
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:52,283
There was a rubber sealant applied to it.

545
00:38:53,344 --> 00:38:53,805
witnessed it.

546
00:38:54,606 --> 00:38:56,628
It was put down at the right temperature.

547
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,890
It was compacted at the right temperature.

548
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,871
There was tack coat down.

549
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:01,994
If any of the seams fail, we're going to know by April.

550
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:03,856
So we'll monitor it.

551
00:39:04,257 --> 00:39:10,644
Just so you know, and just the conversation I had with paving companies that do highways and so on, they did tell us

552
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:18,322
The longevity or the length of that reliability for that roadway, because there are seams, are drastically different.

553
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:19,403
Drastically.

554
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:21,384
It's not like a seam.

555
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,205
There's no gap.

556
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:23,986
It's lifted above.

557
00:39:25,147 --> 00:39:27,429
So what they came out with, I went out there with them.

558
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:28,170
They looked at it.

559
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,751
They said, what I'm saying is seam is what we see.

560
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:35,015
So what we see, no matter what it is, they've told me- I've also been doing this for 20 years.

561
00:39:35,515 --> 00:39:36,436
I've seen this before.

562
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:38,037
It usually wears off in the winter time.

563
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,200
If it doesn't and a seam forms, we're going to know.

564
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,126
And then they'll be able to... So what safeguards do we have in the next season?

565
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:49,828
There's a few punch list items that we have.

566
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:54,633
A few of the castings are a little depressed.

567
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,415
We need those addressed.

568
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:59,758
The bike lane temporary pavements are

569
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:01,919
temporary markings still need to go into place.

570
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:03,219
They're gonna be going in next week.

571
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:09,062
There's a speed table down at Victory Park that's also going to be placed on Thursday.

572
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:11,783
And so that'll get us through the winter.

573
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:22,848
And then next year, they should be doing all the rest of the restoration on the rest of Winthrop Street, the handicap ramps, and then Mystic Ave, Main Street.

574
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:28,590
Okay, so just for entertainment's sake,

575
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,084
If you had your choice, would you have rather done what Winchester did?

576
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:37,209
And having no seams?

577
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:40,333
That's for you guys to debate.

578
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:46,700
I'm saying as a professional that we pay for the city of Medford, who is you, would you recommend that or would you recommend the piece?

579
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,641
as ever so says it needs mask.

580
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:53,803
Oh, that's not good right now, my friend.

581
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:56,044
I'm asking you as a as a city.

582
00:40:56,224 --> 00:40:58,485
So this is what we don't need on.

583
00:40:58,866 --> 00:40:59,746
This is the problem we have.

584
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:03,769
I know that we're going after our smaller businesses and saying we're going to pay curb to curb.

585
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,570
And that that fee goes up to our residents.

586
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:06,770
Now.

587
00:41:07,071 --> 00:41:10,333
We're asking for one of the richest companies in the Commonwealth

588
00:41:11,073 --> 00:41:15,775
to make sure they pave a road the way the standards that those neighbors deserve, right, my friend?

589
00:41:15,795 --> 00:41:16,615
So this is what I'm asking.

590
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:26,639
If you don't really see that, this is what we need, because we've been crying for years that we should have a clerk of the works, that we find a way that we have a clerk of the works for these jobs.

591
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:33,161
Because what Councilor Caviello is saying is the person that ever saw us has promised us that's going to work with us.

592
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:35,942
Maybe they've worked with you, but

593
00:41:37,002 --> 00:41:42,605
or department at City Hall, the mayor's office or whatnot, but we haven't been getting any information on what's been going on.

594
00:41:43,165 --> 00:41:48,107
And this is what's sad, this is why I have a resolution later about communication with the city.

595
00:41:48,647 --> 00:42:00,072
This is the stuff, and I'm sorry, you're just the person that, and I know we've been called bullies, by the way, because I'm not trying to, I'm looking for a professional that's in our community that's gonna say, no, George,

596
00:42:00,592 --> 00:42:01,393
This isn't right.

597
00:42:01,473 --> 00:42:05,798
The best thing is that, because the professionals that I'm friends with that said, yeah, let's go for a ride.

598
00:42:06,138 --> 00:42:09,662
And we went for a ride and they said they do highways, big jobs across the country.

599
00:42:10,043 --> 00:42:14,107
They said, no, honestly, the truth of the matter is the best way to do it is no seams.

600
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:16,133
Okay, that's what they've told me.

601
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:20,094
So I know you have 20 years of experience, but- I agree with your assessment.

602
00:42:20,154 --> 00:42:20,775
Okay, thank you.

603
00:42:20,795 --> 00:42:22,175
Can I ask that question in a different way?

604
00:42:22,516 --> 00:42:23,496
So, thank you.

605
00:42:23,776 --> 00:42:28,178
What is the reason why Winchester can shut down all traffic?

606
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:30,159
Is there a specific reason why they can shut down all traffic?

607
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:32,160
You'd have to take that up with the traffic sergeants.

608
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:32,820
Okay.

609
00:42:38,383 --> 00:42:40,764
Yeah, they were limited in time between nine and two.

610
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:41,647
Okay.

611
00:42:42,147 --> 00:42:42,407
Okay.

612
00:42:42,647 --> 00:42:42,947
Thank you.

613
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:45,708
Um, and that's the traffic supervisor on our side.

614
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:46,168
Yeah.

615
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:46,628
Okay.

616
00:42:46,768 --> 00:42:47,048
Thank you.

617
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:48,449
But again, thank you.

618
00:42:48,529 --> 00:42:49,289
Thank you for being here.

619
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:50,009
I appreciate it.

620
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:54,970
And I again, I think the frustration is those neighbors that I, you know, your frustrations every day.

621
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:55,270
Yeah.

622
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,070
I'm here just to answer questions.

623
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,431
I, you know, this is, it's tough though.

624
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:09,133
I, you know, whenever source, when they came in, they said there's no benefit to our residents, but they're going to at least leave it better than the way they saw it.

625
00:43:09,894 --> 00:43:10,815
I tend to disagree.

626
00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:20,462
I would call Ebersole some shame, because if that's what you're leaving and that's what we're going to do and you're blaming, whatever, I'm not going to go there.

627
00:43:20,482 --> 00:43:21,062
But thank you very much.

628
00:43:21,883 --> 00:43:22,163
Thank you.

629
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,864
Question bears on Councilor Carvilla.

630
00:43:23,884 --> 00:43:24,685
Thank you, Madam President.

631
00:43:26,326 --> 00:43:31,129
Yeah, I mean, I tend to agree that we should be doing this the best way possible.

632
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:32,670
I just have two clarifying questions.

633
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:38,835
It sounds like what you're saying, Owen, is that this is the situation for the winter.

634
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:46,214
The idea is that what the current visible, what looks like a visible seam will wear away in the winter and become a flat.

635
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:48,756
It should, it's cosmetic only.

636
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:53,179
And if it doesn't, that we will likely not accept it in a condition if it does not.

637
00:43:53,239 --> 00:44:02,945
If it doesn't, I don't, I mean, there's an edge, it's in the travel lane, it shouldn't cause an issue, it's cosmetic only.

638
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:07,528
Right, but let's say that there, if it doesn't hold, you said if it doesn't hold, we'll know by April.

639
00:44:07,548 --> 00:44:08,789
If it doesn't hold, we'll know by April.

640
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:11,502
And if it doesn't hold, then you have to redo it.

641
00:44:11,622 --> 00:44:12,203
Then they have to redo it.

642
00:44:12,263 --> 00:44:12,523
All right.

643
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,784
Well, I think that's important to clarify and put out there.

644
00:44:14,804 --> 00:44:15,785
So we have not accepted it.

645
00:44:15,885 --> 00:44:16,945
We're going to go through the winter.

646
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:20,007
If it doesn't hold, then it will be redone.

647
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:20,427
Correct.

648
00:44:20,927 --> 00:44:21,187
All right.

649
00:44:21,908 --> 00:44:33,474
And the second thing is I want to just clarify and put out there is essentially the conditions that we're putting on the construction companies, you're saying that's coming from the traffic sergeants at the police department?

650
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:41,521
The conditions of when they can operate comes from the traffic sergeant.

651
00:44:41,741 --> 00:44:42,042
All right.

652
00:44:42,482 --> 00:44:47,789
And is that a mutual discussion between your office and the traffic sergeant?

653
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:49,772
I let the police department.

654
00:44:50,236 --> 00:44:50,636
handle that.

655
00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:51,477
All right.

656
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:56,139
Well, it just sounds to me like, you know, we're trying to balance interests here.

657
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,121
And I completely respect the interest of safety and understand there's a high school there.

658
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:05,944
As far as the engineering division is concerned, or the DPW, we won't get in the way unless it's a safety issue.

659
00:45:06,044 --> 00:45:08,606
But their safety concerns mostly outweigh ours.

660
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:11,347
So safety concerns are basically temperature driven.

661
00:45:12,428 --> 00:45:13,568
Theirs is like traffic.

662
00:45:14,609 --> 00:45:14,869
Right.

663
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,470
And I'm just saying it sounds like

664
00:45:17,037 --> 00:45:30,564
in terms of the balancing of interests in the situation, that we are making a decision to potentially do work in a way that would not be the preferred way to do the work, or there may be a way to do the work differently.

665
00:45:31,024 --> 00:45:37,467
That's means and methods, and that's kind of like contractual stuff.

666
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:38,288
There's a leeway.

667
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:46,392
I think what we're dancing around here is that we could have a discussion in the city to have authorized this work to occur in a different way at a different time,

668
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:49,301
and it may have had a different result.

669
00:45:50,741 --> 00:46:15,497
Right, and I think it's important that we have that discussion and not just defer 100% entirely to say, you know, I'm sure that the minds in the city and the people that we pay salaries, professional salaries to in the city and the police department, engineering division and anywhere else, plus the people from Eversource and the contractor could have sat down and said, here's a way that we can make a plan where we do close the street for a certain period of time and do this this way.

670
00:46:16,825 --> 00:46:25,737
It doesn't sound like out of the bounds of what we could be able to accomplish here, and I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but those are the kinds of discussions and collaborative approaches I think we need.

671
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:28,580
Closing down that street has a lot of competing interests.

672
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:29,721
Right, and I agree with that.

673
00:46:30,102 --> 00:46:31,544
And I think that's the other thing, right?

674
00:46:31,844 --> 00:46:35,268
If we're going to have the conversation and discuss the competing interests,

675
00:46:36,191 --> 00:46:39,152
Before the project comes, we say, we're doing it this way.

676
00:46:39,232 --> 00:46:40,712
This is the result we're expecting.

677
00:46:40,772 --> 00:46:43,833
The competing interests worked out this way, and this is why the decision was made.

678
00:46:44,373 --> 00:46:57,216
And then we're not coming here after the fact and saying, we don't like the quality of the work, or we don't understand the quality of the work, or we're concerned that it's gonna break down, which is what I'm hearing from experts that Councilor Scarpelli went out with and Councilor Carvillo, quite frankly.

679
00:46:57,256 --> 00:47:00,897
I've driven down the road and I didn't find it sufficient.

680
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:05,778
I've driven down a lot of repaved roads and it didn't seem like the best version of that that I've ever driven down.

681
00:47:06,498 --> 00:47:11,164
We had the issue on Mystic Avenue, which is the same project and the same contractor.

682
00:47:11,324 --> 00:47:16,270
So, you know, again, you are one part of a puzzle that makes this decision and I understand that.

683
00:47:16,711 --> 00:47:20,355
But as we discuss it, you know, having all those minds meet and say,

684
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:39,473
maybe the competing interests, because this is a once in a generation opportunity to repave a major thoroughfare without cost to the city, maybe it's worth the interest of shutting down that road at a certain time or doing some work at night or doing something differently than we would for a smaller project with less impact.

685
00:47:39,553 --> 00:47:41,694
So that's all I'm really trying to say.

686
00:47:41,714 --> 00:47:45,495
And I think that that kind of approach is what we should take.

687
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:50,157
So I'm not trying to put blame on the traffic sergeants or blame on you or blame anybody other than to say,

688
00:47:50,997 --> 00:48:01,323
I think that if we had come together and had the minds meet on this and said it's the priority that we do it this way instead of this way, this wouldn't be a conversation that we're having.

689
00:48:02,544 --> 00:48:02,884
Thank you.

690
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:04,785
May I make a comment?

691
00:48:07,347 --> 00:48:07,587
Please.

692
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:10,069
This is Bob Coates from Eversource again.

693
00:48:10,649 --> 00:48:19,594
I just want to be clear that the police department, the traffic sergeants have been very collaborative in working with us and giving us extended work hours wherever possible.

694
00:48:21,548 --> 00:48:25,230
and you know, it's obviously their decision on public safety and concerns.

695
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:47,360
In this case, we had to pave it during the hours that Mr. Witella highlighted, and I understand the impacts, but I don't want you to have the perception that the police department and the traffic sergeants have not been working collaboratively with us and have found creative ways as we got through Winthrop Circle and allowed us to accelerate some of the activities to get things done faster.

696
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,080
So thank you.

697
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:49,681
Thank you.

698
00:48:49,895 --> 00:48:52,296
Yeah, and just to be clear, that wasn't my implication.

699
00:48:52,336 --> 00:48:58,517
I'm saying that all parties involved could have come together and made a different solution, right?

700
00:48:58,697 --> 00:48:59,478
I understand.

701
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:01,098
Thank you.

702
00:49:02,178 --> 00:49:02,799
Councilor Carvilla.

703
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:03,819
Thank you, Mr. President.

704
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:18,003
I think if you went to the residents in that area and you asked them if maybe one night of disruption or two nights of disruption, where, as they say, you could have easily shut that road down and they could have went down, placed that road and right around that.

705
00:49:19,254 --> 00:49:24,318
If they did it at night, it wasn't that, we're not talking no major overhaul here or anything.

706
00:49:24,778 --> 00:49:34,806
And I think the neighbors would have, after what they've gone through for the five, six, seven years that this project, I think they would rather have a quality job than what we're seeing now.

707
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:37,348
So no one answered my question.

708
00:49:37,668 --> 00:49:44,153
Who is the person that's being paid by Eversource to oversee this job for the city of Medford?

709
00:49:46,635 --> 00:49:47,556
I want a name of a person.

710
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,201
that there was, there was, well, there were a few.

711
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:54,643
I mean, depending on the contractor and what they were doing.

712
00:49:56,364 --> 00:49:59,645
I mean, Eversource will be able to answer this question.

713
00:50:00,146 --> 00:50:06,849
Can the gentleman of Eversource give us the name of the person who was paid by them to oversee this project for the city of Medford?

714
00:50:07,149 --> 00:50:11,071
And if I recall, there was some company out of Connecticut that was hired.

715
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:12,651
Todd, are you able to answer that?

716
00:50:12,671 --> 00:50:15,553
I defer to Mr. Coates.

717
00:50:16,835 --> 00:50:18,496
I don't have the name in front of me, sir.

718
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:22,139
I don't want to give you the wrong name, so I'm happy to provide that.

719
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,561
But I don't have it in front of me, the specific name.

720
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:31,144
Going forward, you talked about speed tables.

721
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:38,069
So I noticed there's one up right in Winter Street, or right where the road splits.

722
00:50:38,329 --> 00:50:38,469
Yeah.

723
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:40,090
Where is the next one planned for?

724
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:40,911
Victory Park.

725
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:43,012
Why not closer to the school?

726
00:50:43,652 --> 00:50:44,913
It's right after school.

727
00:50:44,933 --> 00:50:46,054
Victory Park is after the school.

728
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:48,137
Well, going the other way, yeah.

729
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:55,300
So the sidewalks that are torn up at the park, are those gonna be replaced with concrete, not asphalt?

730
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,103
No, it's definitely concrete, yes.

731
00:51:00,363 --> 00:51:02,724
That was the plan to have those done prior to the paving.

732
00:51:02,944 --> 00:51:13,169
So going forward, seeing that we know we screwed up that part, going forward, when they come back in the spring, I think the discussion will be had, maybe you can

733
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:25,816
give the neighbors, we do 911 calls for everything and every party and every little thing that goes on in the city, but the neighbors know that they may have maybe a night or two of disruption to get a quality job.

734
00:51:27,058 --> 00:51:36,428
I'm telling you, I'm not gonna accept from where you did it, we've still gotta go all the way down Winter Street, you gotta get on South Street, you gotta go Mystic Avenue, I'm telling you.

735
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:45,983
We better see a quality job, because what they've done in that half a mile strip is horrible.

736
00:51:46,363 --> 00:51:50,444
And the residents of the city deserve a lot more than what they got there.

737
00:51:51,204 --> 00:51:53,485
Why is there a square patch in front of the high school driveway?

738
00:51:57,287 --> 00:51:59,627
I say, I did the same thing Councilor Scott Tolley did.

739
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:02,668
I brought someone down that does highway work.

740
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:06,770
And they laughed at me and said, they don't even think this is gonna last the winter.

741
00:52:07,984 --> 00:52:14,309
So what happens, do we have a warranty, a five-year warranty or a 10-year warranty?

742
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:16,271
Yeah, we haven't accepted the roadway.

743
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:29,962
But even after we accept it, how long is the... So they do it next year and you accept it and it starts coming up.

744
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:35,408
Do we have some five years, or do we have a five year plan?

745
00:52:35,428 --> 00:52:36,808
I don't think warranties work like that.

746
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:42,672
We monitor it to make sure that it's placed in spec.

747
00:52:43,132 --> 00:52:49,636
And if it usually is placed in spec, it'll usually be the lifespan of a normal road.

748
00:52:51,097 --> 00:52:59,922
It's my suggestion, before any more paving's done, that the neighbors be called and give them the option of, I say, I don't think they'd mind, and neither do,

749
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,682
of a little bit of disruption.

750
00:53:02,702 --> 00:53:04,724
You can say it's not that big of a job.

751
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:06,286
We offered that suggestion as well.

752
00:53:06,907 --> 00:53:09,931
And it was, who did you offer it to?

753
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,355
We offered it to the whole team and the police department didn't want to be there.

754
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:16,952
I think maybe the police department should be, I think we should get them up here.

755
00:53:16,972 --> 00:53:19,293
Again, there's also like, you know, competing interests.

756
00:53:19,353 --> 00:53:23,775
I mean, one, you can say that like one resident will allow it, another resident will not.

757
00:53:23,976 --> 00:53:25,156
We're the ones who get the calls.

758
00:53:25,837 --> 00:53:26,517
I get the calls.

759
00:53:26,717 --> 00:53:27,297
I do too.

760
00:53:27,497 --> 00:53:28,858
Everyone in this room is getting the calls.

761
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:33,361
And they want to know why we're paying, why we're getting what we're getting.

762
00:53:33,721 --> 00:53:37,203
And because they drive, they drive right through and they go to Winchester and then they say,

763
00:53:38,046 --> 00:53:42,750
that would, like I said, like you said, our standards, any different than Winchester standards?

764
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,091
It should be, it's exactly the same.

765
00:53:44,111 --> 00:53:44,671
Should be the same.

766
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:46,953
That road should look the same going all the way through.

767
00:53:47,453 --> 00:53:49,895
And they got a couple more miles of paving the door.

768
00:53:50,375 --> 00:53:59,903
And I'll tell you, I'm gonna be screaming to the higher top, if it's not done correctly, and I'm not gonna accept any more paving that looks like the crap that they did up there now.

769
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:00,363
Okay.

770
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:02,585
Councilor Collins.

771
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:05,676
Thanks, Owen, for being here.

772
00:54:06,116 --> 00:54:08,097
My question is also about sidewalks.

773
00:54:09,197 --> 00:54:18,679
If the sidewalk mitigation is rolled into the same project by Eversource or their contractor, I was just curious if you had a quick status update on your fingertips.

774
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:19,439
If not, that's fine.

775
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:21,560
I was hearing from constituents who were dealing with sidewalks.

776
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:29,141
Yes, some of the money was used to redo some sidewalk, widening the sidewalk from four feet to five feet at Victory Park.

777
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,842
The rest of it was shifted to

778
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:41,948
the Lorraine to Smith Road that hold the missing chunks that are doing and that's coming through a separate city contract that will start at this point.

779
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:43,831
So that'll start in the spring?

780
00:54:43,931 --> 00:54:44,111
Yeah.

781
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:44,511
Okay.

782
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:47,612
And then basically they'll saw cut along the lines.

783
00:54:47,893 --> 00:54:52,835
We'll hide it with the pavement markings so there shouldn't be any seam or anything.

784
00:54:52,855 --> 00:54:53,595
It'll look clean.

785
00:54:53,955 --> 00:54:54,356
Okay, great.

786
00:54:54,376 --> 00:54:59,058
Are there any interim measures for folks on wheelchairs, strollers, with those missing chunks in the meantime?

787
00:54:59,078 --> 00:55:01,279
I don't think there's interim measures at this point for the winter.

788
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,882
The orange line slowed us down and it

789
00:55:08,215 --> 00:55:08,755
Sure, totally.

790
00:55:08,775 --> 00:55:13,037
I understand that added up a bunch of full-time jobs to the DPW's roster.

791
00:55:13,357 --> 00:55:18,438
I'm just curious, are there added crosswalks just to maintain ADA compliance while all that's been worked out?

792
00:55:18,539 --> 00:55:24,621
We're trying to have all the ramps along that corridor are supposed to be upgraded to be ADA compliant.

793
00:55:25,461 --> 00:55:29,082
So we're adding some crosswalks, eat tables, bike lanes.

794
00:55:29,422 --> 00:55:30,242
It'll be a complete street.

795
00:55:30,823 --> 00:55:31,783
But that'll happen in the spring.

796
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:32,783
Yes.

797
00:55:33,464 --> 00:55:35,204
Well, you'll see most of it probably.

798
00:55:35,224 --> 00:55:37,685
You're going to see the roadway portion of it probably this winter.

799
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:44,283
except it's gonna be temporary pavement markings instead of permanent pavement markings.

800
00:55:44,944 --> 00:55:47,605
So it'll look the same, but it's just temporary.

801
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:48,546
Okay, gotcha.

802
00:55:48,626 --> 00:55:57,671
Essentially what I'm trying to get at is for folks who can't hop over an uneven sidewalk through the winter, do they have recourse right now or is it avoid that sidewalk and toll?

803
00:55:57,931 --> 00:55:59,452
I don't, yeah.

804
00:55:59,952 --> 00:56:01,233
Where in particular are you talking?

805
00:56:02,073 --> 00:56:03,354
I'd have to reference my inbox.

806
00:56:03,514 --> 00:56:03,814
Okay.

807
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:06,756
There historically was never, there wasn't a sidewalk there to begin with.

808
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,603
Not that that makes it any better, but there was never a sidewalk there.

809
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:14,526
I've heard from folks- If there's no sidewalk, don't walk there, I guess.

810
00:56:14,707 --> 00:56:17,449
All right, so it's coming.

811
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:19,191
All right, thanks.

812
00:56:20,012 --> 00:56:20,452
Councilor Sang.

813
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:27,135
So there's been a lot of discussion about means and methods and comparing our community to other communities.

814
00:56:27,215 --> 00:56:41,507
I think it might be helpful for us all to sit down sometime next year, maybe in a committee of the whole, invite you and invite some other people involved in the decision making to really make it more transparent and see what are the things that we could change.

815
00:56:42,374 --> 00:56:57,664
both at the city level but also at the ordinance kind of city council level to make your work easier and to make projects like this more of a success, so it's less of a question more of a, I think this is something that our council could do next year.

816
00:56:57,684 --> 00:56:58,565
Thank you.

817
00:56:59,125 --> 00:56:59,425
Thank you.

818
00:56:59,485 --> 00:57:00,526
One more question.

819
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:04,869
So I saw where on the rain road and Smith they put that new sidewalk there.

820
00:57:05,868 --> 00:57:28,734
are we continuing there's another little strip of bill we're finishing up we're going to finish all the way down the place that road yep that's the intent thank you yeah i just have two very specific questions because i do live right there so i see it very closely every day um i did see the speed table go in which i'm very happy about um i noticed and i'm sure there's a reason it doesn't extend curb to curb correct so i've already seen

821
00:57:29,662 --> 00:57:30,603
cars go around it.

822
00:57:31,483 --> 00:57:33,284
Well, that's, it's coming.

823
00:57:33,544 --> 00:57:35,505
Just continue to extend.

824
00:57:35,805 --> 00:57:40,087
Well, what's, what's gonna happen is we're gonna have the, the white, there'll be paint lines.

825
00:57:40,128 --> 00:57:47,611
So you're, you know, 20 foot wide lane for driving is gonna get narrowed down to about 11 feet, right?

826
00:57:47,812 --> 00:57:50,273
And then there's going to be a bike lane marked as well.

827
00:57:50,553 --> 00:57:54,355
So people will tend to be driving in like hugging that

828
00:57:54,795 --> 00:57:56,056
Yeah, double yellow center line.

829
00:57:56,437 --> 00:57:58,398
Yeah, that'll basically slow everyone back.

830
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:00,040
So it should do to be fair.

831
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,162
And I know you know, this paint is not infrastructure.

832
00:58:02,182 --> 00:58:03,543
So people can drive over paint.

833
00:58:03,623 --> 00:58:08,387
And I just have concern because it's a space where we're trying to slow people down and be safer for pedestrians.

834
00:58:08,467 --> 00:58:17,235
And if some folks are going to swerve around now they're swerving closer to the sidewalk, we I think it's a foot and a half that is not in that area.

835
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:17,635
And

836
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:21,924
that's due to keep the drainage pattern.

837
00:58:24,645 --> 00:58:30,348
If you didn't extend it the whole way, you have to put in catch basins and structures, and that's just crazy.

838
00:58:30,648 --> 00:58:31,609
Thank you.

839
00:58:31,669 --> 00:58:36,611
And I did notice that there was, there's just a fair amount of asphalt debris on the street.

840
00:58:36,691 --> 00:58:38,212
Is there a reason for that?

841
00:58:38,292 --> 00:58:40,393
Is that past Victory Park?

842
00:58:40,513 --> 00:58:47,797
It's in between, it's right, like in between the high school and Placetet, I see a fair amount along the curbs, just debris.

843
00:58:48,337 --> 00:58:50,580
I'll mention it to McCourt to get him swept.

844
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,363
Okay, thank you.

845
00:58:55,045 --> 00:59:00,090
I see we have a little strip of bike lane over by front of the high school, like just a little strip.

846
00:59:00,471 --> 00:59:02,913
Is that strip going to go the whole length of Winchester at some point?

847
00:59:03,214 --> 00:59:03,654
All the way in?

848
00:59:04,215 --> 00:59:05,016
Both ways.

849
00:59:05,356 --> 00:59:06,457
All the way into Winchester?

850
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:07,638
Up to Winchester.

851
00:59:10,658 --> 00:59:22,146
And to see I've gotten, I feel like I asked top for these plans like every six months but to see those full plans is that something you can share the council just so we can get a refresher on where you know that, again, this is just temporary pavement markings.

852
00:59:23,618 --> 00:59:30,819
any issues that we foresee, well, you can make adjustments before the permanent pavement markings go down in the spring.

853
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:37,601
So we're, you know, we're, there's already one little tiny area that we're gonna adjust.

854
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:41,962
So it's, you know, we're welcome to comments.

855
00:59:42,302 --> 00:59:42,462
Yeah.

856
00:59:42,702 --> 00:59:43,562
Thank you.

857
00:59:43,882 --> 00:59:46,023
I do see two members of the public on Zoom, Councilor Knight.

858
00:59:46,963 --> 00:59:47,483
Thank you very much.

859
00:59:47,523 --> 00:59:52,644
So just to recap, currently,

860
00:59:53,734 --> 00:59:59,580
The project that the work is not complete by the contractor right the city has not accepted the roadway correct.

861
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,381
Okay.

862
01:00:02,022 --> 01:00:09,129
The applicant ever source is required to have.

863
01:00:10,562 --> 01:00:13,905
a field engineer, a city field engineer.

864
01:00:14,285 --> 01:00:19,689
Can we get that information published on the Eversource pipeline website that we have here at the city, the page?

865
01:00:20,009 --> 01:00:20,530
We don't, no.

866
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,391
The website's been updated quite some time.

867
01:00:23,092 --> 01:00:24,673
I know, but can we get that information on there?

868
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:27,975
So instead of people calling us, we can say, call the field engineer.

869
01:00:28,015 --> 01:00:29,436
He'll tell you exactly what's going on tomorrow.

870
01:00:29,637 --> 01:00:32,419
You don't want those calls either and you don't need it.

871
01:00:32,479 --> 01:00:33,680
Everyone, you're working on other stuff.

872
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,421
We got a field engineer they're paying for.

873
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:36,422
Why are you going to take the calls?

874
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:37,122
That's what he's here for.

875
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:37,603
Okay.

876
01:00:37,983 --> 01:00:38,243
All right.

877
01:00:39,903 --> 01:00:45,307
Lastly, when is it exactly with the drop dead project completion date?

878
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:49,770
You want me to take that?

879
01:00:50,531 --> 01:00:51,351
Yeah, I do.

880
01:00:51,751 --> 01:00:52,152
Thanks, Rob.

881
01:00:52,252 --> 01:00:58,556
Yeah, so right now we're targeting the end of the third quarter of 2023.

882
01:00:58,636 --> 01:01:05,241
So end of September for completion of the project.

883
01:01:06,302 --> 01:01:07,222
We continue to work.

884
01:01:08,743 --> 01:01:09,544
We continue to work.

885
01:01:10,184 --> 01:01:10,544
I'm sorry.

886
01:01:10,604 --> 01:01:14,607
I'm sorry.

887
01:01:14,647 --> 01:01:18,650
I don't think they'll commit to that, but I think it's very good.

888
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:22,152
I mean, I'm going through my files here.

889
01:01:22,212 --> 01:01:24,354
I have April 30th, 2015, 19th, 2015, October 20th, 2015.

890
01:01:24,814 --> 01:01:24,954
It's 2023.

891
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:42,739
It will be relatively soon, relatively soon it will be, you know, so this is something that needs to come to an end.

892
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:48,629
And it needs to be done before school opens again because every year.

893
01:01:49,857 --> 01:01:51,898
all summer long, it's nice and quiet.

894
01:01:52,018 --> 01:01:56,001
And then come the second, the third week in August, we decided we want to rip up every street in the city.

895
01:01:56,381 --> 01:01:58,663
I mean, this year we did it at the Brooke school, right?

896
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:03,446
Literally the first day of school, let's start a construction project around four streets that surround the school.

897
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:03,926
All right.

898
01:02:04,147 --> 01:02:04,967
We need to plan better.

899
01:02:05,668 --> 01:02:05,868
All right.

900
01:02:05,908 --> 01:02:12,232
So we, we, we can't put this neighborhood through any more undue strain and stress.

901
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:14,894
Now I know there's a ton of benefits that come with this through the MOU.

902
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:18,921
Um, I've exercised as much patience as I possibly can on this.

903
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:30,209
Um, and I appreciate, um, all that you're going to try to do to get out of our city so that you can move on to the next eight miles of, uh, pipeline that you have to do somewhere else.

904
01:02:30,249 --> 01:02:30,610
I'm sure.

905
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:35,974
Um, but with that being said, um, I'd like to see that, um, contact information published on the city website.

906
01:02:36,334 --> 01:02:38,155
And, um, I'd like to get a commitment from Eversource.

907
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:40,056
This is going to be done before the opening of school.

908
01:02:42,578 --> 01:02:43,579
You like that in the form of motion.

909
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,175
I'm sorry I can't hear the counselor.

910
01:02:54,556 --> 01:02:58,378
If I'd like to see a commitment that this is going to be completed before school reopens in September.

911
01:02:58,938 --> 01:03:05,641
And if we can't get that commitment that I'd like to see monthly written updates, relative to the progress of the construction.

912
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:14,626
I'm here in my hand I have a card from a gentleman from Watkins strategies his name was Sean so tell him he was the senior public affairs specialist for Watkins strategy.

913
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:24,794
Back when this job, he probably retired by now, it's been so long, but back when this job started, Sean would send us weekly updates and monthly updates saying, this is what to expect, this is what's going on.

914
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,996
We also got updates like that with the Craddock Bridge project.

915
01:03:28,496 --> 01:03:31,238
And they'd say, the project is 73% complete.

916
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,461
We've done this, this, and this, this week, next week we're doing this, this, and this.

917
01:03:35,021 --> 01:03:37,723
So then we don't have to call, we don't have to do this, right?

918
01:03:40,281 --> 01:03:40,943
Thank you, Councilor Nye.

919
01:03:41,204 --> 01:03:45,017
I do see two members of the public with their hands up going to Matt Sirigu.

920
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:46,382
I will unmute you.

921
01:03:49,768 --> 01:03:52,309
Hi, Matt Sergi with 386 Lawrence Road.

922
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:57,312
I just wanted, I wanted to ask about the stretch from Winthrop Circle to Lawrence Road.

923
01:03:57,712 --> 01:04:07,577
There was, I assume this is, and I'm almost certain this isn't the final product, but it was like they just rolled some pavement out there and it's all pretty much ripped up already.

924
01:04:07,717 --> 01:04:16,161
And it's, it's, the patchwork was pretty bad to begin with, but it's, it's honestly probably worse than if they had done nothing, it seems.

925
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:28,073
So will that be fixed before, like the plows are gonna rip up what's left of it, I assume, and it's got all that asphalt must be going down the drainage.

926
01:04:28,093 --> 01:04:31,274
I just wanted to ask if there was a plan to correct that.

927
01:04:34,435 --> 01:04:36,096
I'm not aware of any plan to correct that.

928
01:04:36,596 --> 01:04:38,176
I think it's gonna be monitored through.

929
01:04:39,337 --> 01:04:43,378
So currently it's the final product between Windrup Circle and, it's the final product with Windrup Circle.

930
01:04:43,398 --> 01:04:44,519
It's not the final product.

931
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:45,299
Okay.

932
01:04:45,319 --> 01:04:47,780
That section will be paved next spring.

933
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,100
Okay.

934
01:04:49,269 --> 01:04:50,210
but it will be that way.

935
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,832
It was meant to even out the trenching because it was all wonky.

936
01:04:53,252 --> 01:04:53,913
Okay.

937
01:04:54,253 --> 01:04:54,493
Thank you.

938
01:04:54,533 --> 01:04:56,755
Does that address your question, Mr. Sergo?

939
01:04:58,637 --> 01:04:58,917
Sure.

940
01:05:01,479 --> 01:05:01,799
Thank you.

941
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,262
Going to Mike S, name and address for the record, please.

942
01:05:08,925 --> 01:05:11,307
I am Mike, I live on Hancock Street.

943
01:05:11,347 --> 01:05:14,469
I just heard them talking about the pavement that it was only cosmetic.

944
01:05:15,715 --> 01:05:18,496
and that it wasn't a big deal because it was in the middle of the lane.

945
01:05:18,516 --> 01:05:29,579
I ride a motorcycle down Winter Street all the time and that's a huge hazard because it's right where I wanna be in the middle of the lane, heading from Medford towards Winchester.

946
01:05:30,379 --> 01:05:34,900
And now I gotta either hug where the cars are or I gotta hug the broken up sidewalk.

947
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,241
So I don't think it's just a cosmetic thing.

948
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:41,742
I think it is a hazard if you're on a motorcycle, that's all.

949
01:05:44,602 --> 01:05:44,942
Thank you, Mike.

950
01:05:44,962 --> 01:05:46,743
Can I just get your name once more for the record?

951
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:48,604
Mike Seekman.

952
01:05:50,024 --> 01:05:50,385
Thank you.

953
01:05:55,207 --> 01:05:57,088
Any other members of the public wish to speak?

954
01:05:57,148 --> 01:05:58,888
Any further discussion from the council at this time?

955
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:02,710
Councilor Kerrio.

956
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:13,775
Madam President, I'd like to adopt Councilor Knight's motion that we get a weekly or a monthly update on what's going on there, similar to what we got with other projects.

957
01:06:15,034 --> 01:06:16,394
and the name of the field engineer.

958
01:06:16,915 --> 01:06:28,021
So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to get the name of the field engineer onto the Eversource project website and to ask for a commitment from Eversource that this project be completed by the next school year.

959
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:32,283
If that cannot be committed to, weekly updates, correct?

960
01:06:33,804 --> 01:06:34,405
Monthly updates.

961
01:06:35,485 --> 01:06:37,987
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

962
01:06:40,668 --> 01:06:41,909
Sorry, as amended by Councilor Carviello.

963
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:54,152
I think, yeah, whatever.

964
01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:57,113
Whatever you have down, what do you have down?

965
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:04,476
I would put in, I don't really say yeah.

966
01:07:05,156 --> 01:07:06,297
Either one of us will know.

967
01:07:06,637 --> 01:07:07,758
Great, we'll go with that, we'll go.

968
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:15,501
Motion of Councilor Carviello as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Knight.

969
01:07:16,862 --> 01:07:17,782
Please call the roll when you're ready.

970
01:07:20,992 --> 01:07:21,332
I'm sorry.

971
01:07:22,113 --> 01:07:22,653
All those in favor?

972
01:07:22,673 --> 01:07:22,733
Aye.

973
01:07:22,933 --> 01:07:24,074
All those opposed?

974
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:24,574
Nay.

975
01:07:24,954 --> 01:07:25,515
Motion passes.

976
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:26,795
Old habits die hard.

977
01:07:27,856 --> 01:07:29,097
All right, where are we?

978
01:07:29,317 --> 01:07:29,997
Thank you, Owen.

979
01:07:31,638 --> 01:07:33,359
And thank you, Todd and Bob.

980
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:35,561
Okay.

981
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:38,162
Thank you.

982
01:07:38,182 --> 01:07:38,602
Thank you.

983
01:07:38,622 --> 01:07:40,343
22-586, offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

984
01:07:40,403 --> 01:07:47,467
Be it so resolved that the city council be presented the process in which the administration designed the plan to allow unleashed dogs in our community parks.

985
01:07:47,547 --> 01:07:48,288
Councilor Scarpelli.

986
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,741
Thank you, Madam President.

987
01:07:49,781 --> 01:07:56,185
First, let me start off by addressing some concerns that my daughter has been reading on social media.

988
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:58,067
We love dogs.

989
01:07:59,087 --> 01:08:00,048
We love our dogs.

990
01:08:00,088 --> 01:08:01,429
I've had dogs my whole life.

991
01:08:01,909 --> 01:08:02,910
I love my dog.

992
01:08:04,311 --> 01:08:13,798
But the question that I put this out is to really discuss the survey that is being put out there by the city administration

993
01:08:14,435 --> 01:08:21,522
to talk about specific hours in specific areas that we have unleashed dogs.

994
01:08:23,263 --> 01:08:32,732
First of all, there is a city ordinance that we as a city council have in our laws here in Medford that you're not supposed to have, you can't have unleashed dogs.

995
01:08:33,585 --> 01:08:33,945
That's it.

996
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:49,058
Why we're doing a survey without presenting this to the council or the understanding of what this means or what the repercussions mean, because right now you're having people, especially the kids, different sports organizations saying, hold on one second.

997
01:08:49,378 --> 01:08:55,143
We've had issues in the past where my daughter was on the field and a dog was unleashed and oh, but it's okay.

998
01:08:55,524 --> 01:08:56,504
It's a good dog.

999
01:08:58,086 --> 01:08:58,906
It's a good dog.

1000
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:01,449
Until that one time that good dog

1001
01:09:02,728 --> 01:09:04,929
becomes violent or something scary happens.

1002
01:09:05,629 --> 01:09:16,835
And for the city administration to put anything out there right now is really disingenuine to this council and understanding our policies and laws here in the city.

1003
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:22,998
There was a concern a few months back about Tufts Park and what we said

1004
01:09:23,876 --> 01:09:32,678
was, well, let's look into fencing the old pool area, because it's still a big area, and they could still have dogs roam in that area, but we put a fence up.

1005
01:09:33,019 --> 01:09:45,162
And the response was, no, because the people that wanted this movement said, that's still keeping their dogs within an area, and they're not free to roam.

1006
01:09:46,958 --> 01:10:05,050
Well, I've read what the city has put out, and the process of having a survey, and the survey coming back, and they're gonna pick places in the city, maybe even fence them off, or cordon them off, and we're gonna set times for when people can go.

1007
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:10,634
We can't even get information for the most vital issues in our community out.

1008
01:10:11,835 --> 01:10:13,215
But we're gonna let Nana be,

1009
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:25,479
who's gonna walk her three-year-old daughter through a certain park, and she didn't see the postings, and she doesn't understand the hours that there can be unleashed dogs in that area.

1010
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:43,574
I don't understand the process and having a survey to go out to talk about a law, an ordinance that we already have in our community, that we have not only in the park side, but also in the city side that says we do not,

1011
01:10:44,808 --> 01:10:48,691
have unleashed dogs in our community for safety reasons.

1012
01:10:51,893 --> 01:10:54,275
And there's a reason for the ordinance.

1013
01:10:54,355 --> 01:10:55,195
It says an animal.

1014
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:56,296
It's an animal.

1015
01:10:57,277 --> 01:11:00,299
I love my dog like a human too, but it's still an animal.

1016
01:11:00,659 --> 01:11:04,081
There are no guarantees with that animal, especially around children.

1017
01:11:06,043 --> 01:11:09,265
So to put this survey out, no matter what it does, what it says,

1018
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:26,849
The end result is that people want to have certain hours, from what I've read, in our community in certain areas, but maybe not ballparks, it's said, but certain areas to leave unleashed dogs.

1019
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:30,792
I think it's a dangerous, dangerous game to play.

1020
01:11:31,765 --> 01:11:35,727
There's a reason why council marks work so hard to implement the dog park.

1021
01:11:35,787 --> 01:11:41,610
There are reasons why there are areas in the state side where the fells that they can run your unleashed dog.

1022
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:59,420
That's why there are areas, but to designate city property and then put hours to it and think that we're going to have the bandwidth in that office to make sure it's communicated to every resident with their child and say,

1023
01:12:00,510 --> 01:12:02,572
that as long as we post it, we're safe.

1024
01:12:03,392 --> 01:12:06,474
I said, I think that's very, very dangerous.

1025
01:12:06,795 --> 01:12:17,142
And I think it's unsafe and it's just, it's a shame that it's put out there to appease people during political times saying that we'll just do a survey.

1026
01:12:18,363 --> 01:12:25,769
So when that survey says, absolutely, let's do 10 o'clock in the morning to two o'clock in the afternoon at Tufts Park,

1027
01:12:27,419 --> 01:12:31,280
during the weeks that the kids are in school and to say, hey, that's great, we're gonna post it.

1028
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:38,982
But we're gonna have that one day that Nana's gonna walk their child that doesn't have the post and the dog's gonna attack.

1029
01:12:39,202 --> 01:12:40,483
That's a very slippery slope.

1030
01:12:40,503 --> 01:12:42,983
That's very dangerous in that sense.

1031
01:12:43,143 --> 01:12:49,305
And believe me, and I'll say it again, George Scarpelli, what camera are we on, loves dogs.

1032
01:12:49,525 --> 01:12:50,165
I love dogs.

1033
01:12:51,085 --> 01:12:56,907
But I also love and respect the people that traverse our community and wanna feel safe.

1034
01:12:57,972 --> 01:12:59,473
So thank you, Madam President.

1035
01:12:59,793 --> 01:13:18,381
I think that my reason for putting this forward is really just to vent and then just to spread some of the concerns that residents did have that's saying that, well, if it happens, this survey happens, they open one spot, what's gonna stop it from moving on?

1036
01:13:18,441 --> 01:13:25,925
And I think that this is, you wanna focus on building a dog park for bigger dogs, you wanna think, well, let's figure that, let's work that out.

1037
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:32,708
Let's look at Tufts Park and maybe closing off that area, fencing off a safe area where dogs can run in a bigger area.

1038
01:13:32,968 --> 01:13:34,589
Maybe that's the solution.

1039
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:44,534
But to put it the way that it reads to me is that possibly having hours around the community for unleashed dogs, I think that's wrong.

1040
01:13:44,654 --> 01:13:52,418
And more importantly, in the form of a motion, is I'd like the city administration to help this councilor understand

1041
01:13:53,451 --> 01:13:56,936
how we can ask for a motion for a city ordinance that's in place.

1042
01:13:57,277 --> 01:13:57,978
Are we changing it?

1043
01:13:58,298 --> 01:14:02,044
Has anybody had talked about changing an ordinance about unleashed dogs?

1044
01:14:02,064 --> 01:14:03,446
Cause I've never heard anything of that.

1045
01:14:04,067 --> 01:14:04,568
So thank you.

1046
01:14:09,774 --> 01:14:10,715
Thank you, President Morella.

1047
01:14:10,835 --> 01:14:12,617
Fellow dog lover here, for the record.

1048
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:17,302
I find myself agreeing with a lot of what Councilor Scarpelli has to offer.

1049
01:14:17,643 --> 01:14:20,246
I also took note of the survey when it was released.

1050
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:25,732
My first thought was just similar to the ARPA Community Survey in general.

1051
01:14:26,373 --> 01:14:29,537
In the community, when we see a survey go out, I'm very curious to know

1052
01:14:31,355 --> 01:14:32,957
What's the plan for the survey?

1053
01:14:33,938 --> 01:14:36,401
What is the goal for how many people to be surveyed?

1054
01:14:36,441 --> 01:14:41,808
What is the process for making sure that we get a representative cross section of the community actually weighing in?

1055
01:14:42,442 --> 01:14:43,423
Will that be reported?

1056
01:14:44,043 --> 01:14:49,246
How will that feedback be translated into policy with this issue in particular because it involves an ordinance?

1057
01:14:50,547 --> 01:15:00,093
I would love advanced notice from the administration on if we are to try to craft or change policy based on the feedback from this ordinance, how will that go?

1058
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:06,957
Especially since that is a multi-jurisdictional event because of the ordinance involved.

1059
01:15:11,236 --> 01:15:12,936
there was one more thing that I had to say.

1060
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:14,977
But it's left my mind.

1061
01:15:15,717 --> 01:15:28,660
Um, you know, in general, I think that I think that Councilor Scarpelli's point about the bandwidth of our animal control specialists as well as our communications bandwidth is really a point well taken that applies to most things in the city.

1062
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:39,062
And I think that when we do put out a survey, especially knowing that it's an issue that constituents are looking to hear about, I think that we need to be proactive about managing expectations, both for

1063
01:15:40,303 --> 01:15:47,425
the timetable on which things are proposed to maybe change and also the scope that it's possible to change things within.

1064
01:15:47,445 --> 01:15:52,407
And again, especially that's relevant here because it would involve city council action as well as administrative action.

1065
01:15:52,947 --> 01:16:00,050
But I think that in many cases, that's really lacking when this sort of, we're just putting feelers out there type of action gets done.

1066
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:06,452
I think it's really, we owe it to the community to let them know, we wanna hear your feedback and also this is the universe of possibility.

1067
01:16:06,992 --> 01:16:07,212
Thank you.

1068
01:16:09,663 --> 01:16:10,083
Thank you.

1069
01:16:10,444 --> 01:16:16,851
Um, I think it's noble and valiant that this city administration's using surveys so much.

1070
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:19,655
I worked in survey research for four years.

1071
01:16:20,295 --> 01:16:28,725
I certainly believe in its role in maintaining trust in the citizenry and getting feedback for ideas and policies.

1072
01:16:29,956 --> 01:16:32,458
I think from that experience, I've also learned a few things.

1073
01:16:32,758 --> 01:16:34,700
The first of which is you gotta have a plan.

1074
01:16:35,641 --> 01:16:55,597
The survey has to slot into a bigger plan in general, and I think it would have been more prudent, especially given that the city council has jurisdiction of ordinances, that the administration should have come to us and asked us about what ideas we were open to, what we were hearing from our residents talking to us,

1075
01:16:57,098 --> 01:16:59,320
and what possibilities that we were open to.

1076
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:02,782
And I think that could have informed the survey creation itself.

1077
01:17:02,802 --> 01:17:16,469
I think I have another concern from the public opinion survey research perspective, which is that I'm afraid that our city surveys aren't representative of our population.

1078
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:18,210
It's one thing to conduct a survey.

1079
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:23,673
It's another thing to post a Google link on Facebook and ask people to fill it out.

1080
01:17:25,616 --> 01:17:36,884
We saw with the ARPA survey that that survey was skewed very much towards homeowners, very much towards certain demographics, towards certain neighborhoods.

1081
01:17:37,465 --> 01:17:43,850
That's something I, you know, if we're putting the energy into creating surveys, I want to make sure that that survey is representative.

1082
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:52,296
I want to make sure that we're actually listening to a whole range of people and having a survey sample that represents our city as a whole.

1083
01:17:55,043 --> 01:18:07,073
I don't know if we will see the results of this survey, but given our city's record with previous surveys, I think that, you know, it remains as a concern of mine.

1084
01:18:07,533 --> 01:18:13,058
And I think it's concerning when we use faulty data to inform our decisions as well.

1085
01:18:13,238 --> 01:18:19,203
And so I think, you know, this is an issue I'm sure all the councillors have heard a lot of things pro and con.

1086
01:18:20,684 --> 01:18:23,907
I'll put on the record too, I love dogs, but I think,

1087
01:18:25,105 --> 01:18:30,270
This is just symptomatic of our city's planning process.

1088
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:43,143
And I think this is a symptom of the need to plan better, to think more far in advance, how we approach policy changes and how we approach soliciting public opinion.

1089
01:18:43,183 --> 01:18:47,548
And I think Councilor Scarpelli's resolution gets at that point, the process point.

1090
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:55,034
Thank you, Madam President, and I'll be quick because I don't want to be duplicative because I have a feeling Tom's going to say pretty much what I'm about to say.

1091
01:18:55,734 --> 01:19:10,364
But I did put a resolution on this agenda earlier this year, after conversations with our ACO Pat Hogan about the fact that we don't have enough resources right now on animal control issues and on unleashed dogs at the Brooks Estate, which I'm guessing that's what we're going to hear there.

1092
01:19:10,404 --> 01:19:11,705
I'm a member of the Brooks Estate board.

1093
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:26,248
You know, so just want to put that out there it is something that we put on the agenda and said, you know, maybe we could consider something like this an ordinance change if we're also talking about resources going towards it but a survey and no resources just going to leave our staff who are already overstretched and even worse position.

1094
01:19:26,488 --> 01:19:26,828
Thank you.

1095
01:19:27,349 --> 01:19:29,290
Thank you.

1096
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:29,970
Thank you very much.

1097
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,892
I think there's something else that we have to consider here.

1098
01:19:34,453 --> 01:19:39,817
There are many pros and cons that come with living in a neighborhood that has a pocket

1099
01:19:40,747 --> 01:19:43,528
or living in a home that abuts a park.

1100
01:19:45,549 --> 01:19:58,874
One of the largest cons is that a small, minor change at that particular location can have major quality of life issues for the people who live in those homes.

1101
01:20:00,455 --> 01:20:03,936
Look at, for example, place that park on a Saturday morning in the summer.

1102
01:20:05,157 --> 01:20:06,177
Try finding a parking spot.

1103
01:20:06,897 --> 01:20:08,338
Good luck, good luck.

1104
01:20:09,345 --> 01:20:13,927
Driveways blocked every hour on the hour, can't get out of your driveway ever.

1105
01:20:15,948 --> 01:20:32,095
So when you think about the mechanism that this administration loves to use to gather data, it usually consists of sitting behind a computer in an ivory tower, right?

1106
01:20:33,135 --> 01:20:37,977
If you're gonna make a change, get out of city hall, get into the neighborhoods and talk to some people.

1107
01:20:38,873 --> 01:20:39,674
All right, enough's enough.

1108
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:45,738
Because ultimately, if I get a survey about off-leash hours about a dog in the park, you know what I'm gonna do?

1109
01:20:45,938 --> 01:20:46,739
I don't care about dogs.

1110
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:50,061
I'm gonna take it and I'm gonna throw it in the trash and I'm not gonna respond, because I don't care about dogs.

1111
01:20:50,121 --> 01:20:52,183
The only people that are gonna respond are the people that do.

1112
01:20:52,883 --> 01:20:54,985
So you're gonna get a skewed data set right from the start.

1113
01:20:55,966 --> 01:20:57,187
Right from the start.

1114
01:20:57,207 --> 01:21:00,929
Here's a voluntary survey that we're posting on social media.

1115
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:03,271
Okay, so you have to have social media.

1116
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:05,593
You have to follow the city administration.

1117
01:21:07,619 --> 01:21:13,784
for you to even have access to participate in this data collection tool.

1118
01:21:14,705 --> 01:21:22,391
Well, that's not going to give us fair representation of the actual thoughts of the people in this community.

1119
01:21:22,731 --> 01:21:24,273
The data set's flawed right from the start.

1120
01:21:25,274 --> 01:21:31,679
All this is, is a way to say, I have some support to do something that I want to do because someone asked me to do it.

1121
01:21:32,807 --> 01:21:35,148
All right, it's not a good way to create public policy.

1122
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,888
Get out of the office, go talk to some people.

1123
01:21:37,469 --> 01:21:38,969
Have a community meeting, have a neighborhood meeting.

1124
01:21:39,629 --> 01:21:40,670
What park are you gonna do it at?

1125
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:43,251
If you're gonna do it at this park, I'm sure you must have a neighborhood meeting.

1126
01:21:43,491 --> 01:21:44,991
I'm sure you must have called all the abutters.

1127
01:21:45,371 --> 01:21:59,256
I mean, I remember when I sat here and the mayor sat there and we had to change all the notifications on any time anybody filed for a variance, just filed for a variance for 500 feet from the location in a circumference.

1128
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:07,888
But the mayor is going to change what goes on in these parks, which she, by the way, has zero authority to do, pursue it to two city ordinances and the parks and private policy.

1129
01:22:08,248 --> 01:22:13,912
But that goes down a whole other path because, you know, if you don't know how government works, how are we going to get things done?

1130
01:22:13,952 --> 01:22:14,112
Right.

1131
01:22:15,113 --> 01:22:15,273
Right.

1132
01:22:15,694 --> 01:22:21,458
So with that being said, I appreciate Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this issue up, but ultimately these surveys don't work.

1133
01:22:21,858 --> 01:22:23,759
They're not representative of our community.

1134
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:26,041
And I've just outlined the reasons why.

1135
01:22:26,261 --> 01:22:37,288
So how about we stop with the surveys and stop with, you know, these half-assed approaches that operate in the government.

1136
01:22:37,908 --> 01:22:38,969
I mean, cause that's really what it is.

1137
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:40,090
That's really what it is.

1138
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:44,152
And pardon my French, but you know, I rest my case.

1139
01:22:46,885 --> 01:22:49,846
We'll go to Mr Lincoln and then we have two folks on zoom.

1140
01:22:49,906 --> 01:22:53,967
Tom Lincoln, this thing off sorry 27 Gleason Street.

1141
01:22:54,428 --> 01:23:06,031
I find this very interesting for a couple of reasons, among other people are participated in the zoom call earlier this year, where there was a long laundry list of ideas for city parks through

1142
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:09,529
Alicia Hunt's office, et cetera.

1143
01:23:10,369 --> 01:23:13,149
This was one of the ideas raised.

1144
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:18,691
At that time, I said a couple things, which I have not heard here tonight either.

1145
01:23:19,611 --> 01:23:25,272
One is the issue of commercial dog walkers, which is a very, very big business.

1146
01:23:25,572 --> 01:23:28,253
I understand that dogs need to be walked.

1147
01:23:28,313 --> 01:23:29,133
I think that's great.

1148
01:23:29,682 --> 01:23:44,765
but the idea of commercial dog walkers running free on public property with a private business to their gain just doesn't sit well with me and I think with a lot of other people and I suspect not with the council.

1149
01:23:45,185 --> 01:23:51,026
I also echo the views that we don't have the, what's the word here, bandwidth to enforce this.

1150
01:23:52,106 --> 01:23:58,987
We don't have the bandwidth to enforce commercial dog walkers or any other unleashed dog issues in Medford.

1151
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:04,613
The gentleman, the animal control officer does a great job, but he's one person.

1152
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:09,234
And I think he's probably running from pillar to post 24 hours a day.

1153
01:24:09,714 --> 01:24:14,015
Well, it doesn't work 24 days, but during his entire workday.

1154
01:24:14,495 --> 01:24:21,597
And he's not just dealing with dogs, he's dealing with wildlife, coordinating with environmental police and all these sorts of things.

1155
01:24:23,783 --> 01:24:27,546
I'm a little annoyed, I dare say, about the survey.

1156
01:24:27,566 --> 01:24:29,788
I share some of the skepticism.

1157
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:38,014
The surveys tend to be, from what I've seen, biased or certainly loaded.

1158
01:24:39,155 --> 01:24:41,817
They tend to be not well distributed.

1159
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:46,050
And I think it's interesting, I never heard about the survey and I was at that meeting.

1160
01:24:46,811 --> 01:24:52,195
You'd think that they at least send the survey to people that registered for that meeting.

1161
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:55,397
I suspect there are reasons I didn't get the survey, but that's a different question.

1162
01:24:56,278 --> 01:25:09,388
So I think the idea that there's a proposal to have an end run or a vitiation, if that's the right word, of a longstanding ordinance for public safety

1163
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:15,305
public health, water supply quality issues, all these sorts of things.

1164
01:25:15,445 --> 01:25:17,906
I share everybody's concern about children.

1165
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:22,347
A small child is no match for an 80-pound dog, I don't believe.

1166
01:25:22,987 --> 01:25:25,228
I haven't seen it, but I've certainly heard about it.

1167
01:25:26,108 --> 01:25:35,951
And, you know, this is, like many of these things, an ill-considered thin edge of the wedge to really

1168
01:25:37,240 --> 01:26:00,475
you know, a proposal to change longstanding practice with really no thought about the consequences other than to, I'm not sure what the motivation is, but I think it's a very bad idea, despite all the assurances that it's going to be a test, it's going to be this, it's going to be that, it's going to be posted, I'm very skeptical.

1169
01:26:00,735 --> 01:26:02,396
And, you know, we've had different,

1170
01:26:03,847 --> 01:26:04,407
sort of place.

1171
01:26:04,447 --> 01:26:09,530
Of course, the Brooks Estate is conservation land, a protected open space.

1172
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:13,072
It's a wonderful place to walk dogs, but dogs are supposed to be on leashes.

1173
01:26:13,692 --> 01:26:19,916
We've had not a lot of issues, but we've had some issues and I'm not there 24 hours a day like anybody else.

1174
01:26:20,816 --> 01:26:26,519
And, you know, I can just hear people saying, well, you know, it's allowed now.

1175
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:30,041
You know, the ordinance doesn't mean anything because the

1176
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:38,303
Parks Department or the Office of Community Development or whatever it is, said that, you know, we can run around with unleashed dogs.

1177
01:26:38,543 --> 01:26:41,545
And I think that's a very, very bad idea at this point.

1178
01:26:42,245 --> 01:26:42,605
Thank you.

1179
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,546
Going to Jennifer Sullivan on Zoom.

1180
01:26:47,467 --> 01:26:48,467
Your address for the record, please.

1181
01:26:49,568 --> 01:26:53,349
Hello, I'm Jen Sullivan, Marsden Street, right along Barry Park.

1182
01:26:55,190 --> 01:26:56,691
I don't even want to debate the actual

1183
01:26:57,470 --> 01:27:06,699
What the survey was presenting it was more that so i have a sibling who is a firefighter in a neighboring suburb and the amount of phone calls a field.

1184
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:15,007
From people about you know why is this dog here this dog isn't from this particular city or you know what what's the amount of.

1185
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:33,722
manpower bandwidth sorry that it takes to actually run this so when i saw the survey i was kind of reassured because i figured well this this will never happen but also i was really annoyed by the last question which said are you willing to volunteer to helic basically enforce this and someone is a very active.

1186
01:27:34,463 --> 01:27:41,887
participant and longtime resident, I'm sort of sick of being asked to volunteer for things that are quite clearly paid positions.

1187
01:27:43,387 --> 01:27:49,430
So I just wanted to air that out, is that this is something that needs a lot of structure to happen.

1188
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:58,474
And it's not necessarily a bad thing, but there's a lot more that needs to be done and stop asking for volunteers to enforce it, especially when there's animals involved.

1189
01:27:58,494 --> 01:28:01,276
You need to be skilled and accountable.

1190
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:02,236
Thank you.

1191
01:28:03,517 --> 01:28:03,817
Thank you.

1192
01:28:04,356 --> 01:28:07,557
Going to Zoom user Salnier, name and address for the record, please.

1193
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:13,299
Hi, Charlene Salnier, 14 Tontine Street.

1194
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:21,122
So I, excuse me, have been working with Felsdog and MassDog for years now.

1195
01:28:21,902 --> 01:28:28,945
And I was very happy to participate in the Zoom call earlier this year where people got to,

1196
01:28:29,565 --> 01:28:36,167
acknowledge the fact that not only do we have a lot of dogs in Medford, but we have a lot more in the pandemic.

1197
01:28:36,748 --> 01:28:50,473
And that keeping our heads in the sand and not looking at it and not making some appropriate changes isn't going to make the problems that exist with dogs right now any better in the city.

1198
01:28:51,953 --> 01:28:55,474
There are other cities, Arlington, Brooklyn, I don't know about the survey.

1199
01:28:55,594 --> 01:28:57,215
I had nothing to do with this survey.

1200
01:28:57,637 --> 01:29:15,068
other than I contributed what FelsDog had contributed to DCR through the years about what we felt was appropriate reining in and regulation of activity in the Fels, such as dog walkers don't get to walk around for free.

1201
01:29:15,148 --> 01:29:17,110
They have to pay an annual fee.

1202
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:24,595
Infractions have to be doled out for people who don't follow the regulations.

1203
01:29:25,796 --> 01:29:29,038
There has to be a limit of how many dogs you can have off.

1204
01:29:29,419 --> 01:29:34,702
And not only that, but the Green Dogs Program in Brookline, what they do there is

1205
01:29:35,823 --> 01:29:47,465
they actually have to, in order for the dog to be able to be off leash, it has to have a green tag, and they have to demonstrate that they are good on recall.

1206
01:29:48,266 --> 01:29:49,646
And that requires money.

1207
01:29:50,046 --> 01:30:04,489
So obviously, what we recommended to Fell's Dog when they asked us was that there be a fee involved so that it can be covered, so that there is more help and there are more people and more signage and more education.

1208
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:16,090
From that survey, what I just heard preliminarily, I'm not responsible for it, but I just heard, 35 people in Medford said, I would love to help.

1209
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:18,911
I would love to be part of the solution.

1210
01:30:19,432 --> 01:30:24,795
And if a program went forward, I would be willing to help with putting that program into place.

1211
01:30:25,496 --> 01:30:26,276
I mean, I don't know.

1212
01:30:26,336 --> 01:30:33,281
I don't know how many other programs in the city have 35 volunteers that would like very much to be part of this activity.

1213
01:30:34,702 --> 01:30:39,586
I acknowledge that my children are a hell of a lot more important to me than my dogs.

1214
01:30:39,987 --> 01:30:47,834
So anything that injures a child or anything that injures an elderly person or a disabled person is a really bad idea.

1215
01:30:47,854 --> 01:30:55,882
And instead of allowing dogs free reign to whatever park and whatever field they're in now, which is how it is now in the city,

1216
01:30:56,548 --> 01:31:01,449
with dog poop everywhere, this would be a regulated program.

1217
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:06,190
It would be something that pulls the reins in on some of that activity.

1218
01:31:06,710 --> 01:31:09,731
And I think that has the potential to be a good program.

1219
01:31:10,271 --> 01:31:21,173
And I can't really speak to the systematic rolling out of how it happened because like I said, it wasn't that involved in it other than them asking us what our recommendations were.

1220
01:31:21,233 --> 01:31:23,494
So yeah, that's my thoughts.

1221
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:25,633
Thank you, Ms.

1222
01:31:25,653 --> 01:31:26,074
Salier.

1223
01:31:27,135 --> 01:31:28,316
Any further discussion from the council?

1224
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:30,197
Madam President, just real quick.

1225
01:31:31,398 --> 01:31:36,502
I appreciate the caller calling in, but again, I think Councillor Collins brings up the best point.

1226
01:31:37,063 --> 01:31:45,210
When you identify, this is great that 35 people responded, but guess who those people that did the survey, guess where they're from?

1227
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:49,171
They're the dog lovers that walk their dogs off a leash.

1228
01:31:49,831 --> 01:31:51,491
So of course they're gonna get that information.

1229
01:31:52,031 --> 01:31:53,631
This is the problem with the process.

1230
01:31:54,231 --> 01:31:57,332
That was the main question I had with the process.

1231
01:31:58,092 --> 01:32:05,793
And regardless of that personally, I know I've been contacted by a few people from your committee or your program.

1232
01:32:06,954 --> 01:32:13,915
I don't care what other communities do in the city that I live in, that we have audiences from the city, public safety is number one.

1233
01:32:14,855 --> 01:32:16,756
So to allow it is dangerous.

1234
01:32:17,016 --> 01:32:17,496
So thank you.

1235
01:32:18,737 --> 01:32:21,359
Councilor Carviel and then we have Patricia on Zoom.

1236
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:24,000
Thank you, Madam President.

1237
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:29,043
For the record, dog owner for the past 30 plus years.

1238
01:32:29,403 --> 01:32:33,905
Currently, what other dog at this particular time, but I love dogs.

1239
01:32:34,606 --> 01:32:39,909
And I, again, like the woman said, my children are more important than my dogs, even though I love my dog.

1240
01:32:41,075 --> 01:32:50,159
You know, Mr. Lincoln came up and made the point about all these companies coming around, walking dogs all over the city, and we got Pat Hogan.

1241
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:52,100
Pat's very good.

1242
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:54,181
I've called Pat on multiple occasions.

1243
01:32:54,221 --> 01:32:55,062
He's very responsive.

1244
01:32:57,590 --> 01:32:58,210
He's one person.

1245
01:32:58,710 --> 01:32:59,871
How much do we want this guy to do?

1246
01:33:00,091 --> 01:33:01,612
You know what I saw him doing today?

1247
01:33:02,133 --> 01:33:10,258
He was down there with the police chasing down coyotes on Placeton Road this afternoon around 11 o'clock by himself with the police department.

1248
01:33:10,998 --> 01:33:13,240
It's not what he should be doing.

1249
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:20,144
He needs more resources to control all these dog walkers and nevermind the people just letting the dog run free.

1250
01:33:20,164 --> 01:33:25,388
But the other issue that people, if we're gonna go with the dogs is,

1251
01:33:26,471 --> 01:33:28,112
is dog boarding.

1252
01:33:29,593 --> 01:33:34,395
I know he's got multiple calls of people boarding 10 and 15 dogs at their houses now.

1253
01:33:35,455 --> 01:33:39,417
So that's gonna be another up and coming issue for this dog officer.

1254
01:33:39,998 --> 01:33:53,044
When I spoke to him not too long ago, in regards to a neighbor's concern about dogs, he said, Rick, he says, I got five, six, seven other houses that I'm trying to get under control with that have got 10 dogs in them.

1255
01:33:53,993 --> 01:33:58,077
So that's an issue, too, that we're going to have to face going down the line.

1256
01:33:58,898 --> 01:34:09,247
But to have dogs just running free and say, you know, I'm a dog person, it just isn't the way to do things, especially in parks with children.

1257
01:34:10,388 --> 01:34:10,908
It's not right.

1258
01:34:11,469 --> 01:34:14,071
Someone's going to get hurt, and who's going to get sued?

1259
01:34:14,651 --> 01:34:15,332
City of Medford.

1260
01:34:17,077 --> 01:34:27,704
Where are we getting at least, I don't know why KP Law must have gave the city some device to let them think that this was a good idea to move forward on this when we're actually just violating our own law.

1261
01:34:28,944 --> 01:34:29,245
Thank you.

1262
01:34:29,285 --> 01:34:29,885
Councilor Collins.

1263
01:34:30,906 --> 01:34:31,746
Thank you, President Rao.

1264
01:34:32,186 --> 01:34:36,169
I appreciate all of the resident comments on this issue.

1265
01:34:36,829 --> 01:34:44,454
At the end of the day, I'm not even overly concerned about a quick change to our

1266
01:34:45,123 --> 01:34:57,471
dog free range policy precipitating here in Medford because honestly, I think Mr. Lincoln said, and if you didn't, I apologize for putting words in your mouth, why put out a survey at all based on the resident impact, that input that we've received so far.

1267
01:34:58,051 --> 01:34:59,372
We know why they're putting out a survey.

1268
01:35:00,213 --> 01:35:03,455
It's a way of not having to say in response to resident input,

1269
01:35:04,745 --> 01:35:10,169
Actually, we don't have the operating budget to sustain what you are asking for, and that's why we're not doing it.

1270
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:12,791
It's a way of avoiding making that statement.

1271
01:35:13,171 --> 01:35:20,076
And that is the conversation that we really need to be having on this and every other important issue facing the community.

1272
01:35:21,497 --> 01:35:22,998
With that, I would motion for approval.

1273
01:35:25,379 --> 01:35:26,140
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1274
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,121
Going to Patricia on Zoom.

1275
01:35:28,922 --> 01:35:30,323
Patricia, name and address for the record, please.

1276
01:35:32,129 --> 01:35:36,673
My name is Patricia Flynn, and my address is 139 Grant Ave.

1277
01:35:36,693 --> 01:35:40,497
Please proceed.

1278
01:35:41,558 --> 01:35:41,918
Thank you.

1279
01:35:42,539 --> 01:35:50,607
I just wanted to take an opportunity to, I didn't have anything to do with the survey, but I did answer it.

1280
01:35:51,688 --> 01:35:53,770
And it was my understanding that there were

1281
01:35:54,395 --> 01:36:01,180
approximately 600 and maybe 600 answers or responses so far.

1282
01:36:01,961 --> 01:36:05,984
And there were about 211 non dog owners.

1283
01:36:07,104 --> 01:36:11,808
So, just a respective, I just wanted to respectfully.

1284
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:16,206
just, I'm sorry.

1285
01:36:18,788 --> 01:36:26,773
Mr. Councilman Knight had said that the only responses that we would receive would be from dog owners.

1286
01:36:26,913 --> 01:36:30,855
I just wanted to make it clear that I don't agree with that statement.

1287
01:36:31,616 --> 01:36:34,177
And I don't think it's being reflective of the

1288
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:40,785
the responses that we, that the city has received so far.

1289
01:36:40,805 --> 01:36:49,872
I was one of the founding members on the dog park committee and sure.

1290
01:36:53,714 --> 01:36:56,977
It's upon the data that you just mentioned to us.

1291
01:36:57,037 --> 01:37:04,002
It sounds like 66% of the respondents, the dog owners, which is, and you said none would respond, sir.

1292
01:37:06,438 --> 01:37:09,641
Sorry, okay, Patricia, please, this isn't a debate, please continue.

1293
01:37:10,542 --> 01:37:11,342
Yes, thank you.

1294
01:37:12,303 --> 01:37:29,078
So I just wanted to put forth, when we first started thinking about the dog park, we sent out surveys, we visited locations, we spent a lot of time looking at the different circumstances.

1295
01:37:30,552 --> 01:37:38,380
If things change, people on the school committee were against it because it was near children, near the school.

1296
01:37:38,620 --> 01:37:43,365
I'm not saying all the members were, but there was certainly some opposition.

1297
01:37:43,385 --> 01:37:45,127
As far as

1298
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:52,672
The mayor at the time, when we first approached him, there was nothing in the budget.

1299
01:37:53,112 --> 01:38:00,214
We were able to secure funds to see this come to fruition.

1300
01:38:00,914 --> 01:38:03,895
Please don't dismiss somebody because they did a survey.

1301
01:38:04,255 --> 01:38:15,898
I don't think in my opinion, it should be up to seven people on the city council to be able to decide what the residents can receive and can't receive.

1302
01:38:16,992 --> 01:38:23,476
I mean, we're all in this together and I think, and you know, laws can change.

1303
01:38:24,456 --> 01:38:32,280
And I think the reason for this to be put out was just to see where people would stand in the community.

1304
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:35,002
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.

1305
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:38,364
So I think I digress now.

1306
01:38:39,104 --> 01:38:39,965
Thank you for listening.

1307
01:38:40,845 --> 01:38:41,566
Thank you, Patricia.

1308
01:38:42,606 --> 01:38:43,967
On the motion of Councilor Collins,

1309
01:38:45,980 --> 01:38:47,281
to, sorry.

1310
01:38:48,502 --> 01:38:49,463
You okay.

1311
01:38:49,583 --> 01:38:51,725
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1312
01:38:52,546 --> 01:38:53,187
All those in favor?

1313
01:38:54,008 --> 01:38:54,708
All those opposed?

1314
01:38:54,788 --> 01:38:58,071
Motion passes.

1315
01:38:58,092 --> 01:38:58,112
22-587.

1316
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:04,738
Offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it so resolved that the City Administration and the City Council hold a day of beautification for Medford City Hall.

1317
01:39:06,565 --> 01:39:07,345
Thank you, Madam President.

1318
01:39:07,365 --> 01:39:17,471
When I put this forward, I think the frustration came out that as we walked in one day to City Hall, the chambers were used as a storage facility.

1319
01:39:17,991 --> 01:39:24,575
Probably the most hollowed ground in this building was being used as a closet.

1320
01:39:26,176 --> 01:39:27,997
Out front, the floors looked dirty.

1321
01:39:28,457 --> 01:39:29,138
There was

1322
01:39:30,223 --> 01:39:32,265
They were crates, empty crates in the front.

1323
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:35,268
They were floor washers.

1324
01:39:35,749 --> 01:39:43,076
And I think that, you know, as part of this beautification committee that the mayor has in place, I think that

1325
01:39:44,782 --> 01:39:47,103
as well with the city council, I'd like to work together.

1326
01:39:47,284 --> 01:39:56,029
I wouldn't mind getting my hands dirty, but when you come in here, which is supposed to be the most respected room in the community and the way it's being treated.

1327
01:39:56,689 --> 01:40:07,255
And as I'm writing this, a real happy post went out and residents texted me and said, did you just see this post?

1328
01:40:07,295 --> 01:40:08,416
And I said, what does it say?

1329
01:40:09,217 --> 01:40:12,919
During the farmer's market here, we had llamas

1330
01:40:14,445 --> 01:40:18,732
in the foyer of City Hall, llamas.

1331
01:40:19,833 --> 01:40:22,237
I'm working about dogs and we have llamas in the foyer.

1332
01:40:22,277 --> 01:40:30,229
So what I'm asking for is really to work with, ask the beautification committee, I know the mayor has a beautification committee.

1333
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:35,182
in place already that we work together with the council to try to find a way to come in.

1334
01:40:35,202 --> 01:40:45,727
I know that I'm not tooting my own horn, but I have a connection with a very important company, the Furniture Trust Company.

1335
01:40:46,228 --> 01:40:53,331
They came in and donated so much furniture, new furniture for our office staff here to save our community money.

1336
01:40:53,704 --> 01:40:54,645
And I thank them for that.

1337
01:40:55,045 --> 01:40:56,567
No one in the city has thanked them yet.

1338
01:40:57,528 --> 01:40:59,230
City administration still hasn't thanked them.

1339
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:08,139
So I will put a resolution through later to thank the Furniture Trust Company that's been giving furniture and donating furniture throughout this building.

1340
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,542
But they were, that's what all that furniture was here.

1341
01:41:11,062 --> 01:41:12,564
That's why this looks like a big closet.

1342
01:41:13,044 --> 01:41:15,887
But I think that we really need to start taking pride

1343
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:19,612
right from the beginning, and that's when you walk through those doors.

1344
01:41:20,112 --> 01:41:22,594
So I'm willing to work for it.

1345
01:41:23,854 --> 01:41:33,341
I'd like to get a group of people together and maybe come through the building and help move some things if they need, if we don't have staff enough to do that, but that would be my request.

1346
01:41:33,361 --> 01:41:35,542
Thank you, Madam President.

1347
01:41:36,863 --> 01:41:40,105
Can we dress up in costumes on that day?

1348
01:41:40,125 --> 01:41:41,866
Thank you, Madam President.

1349
01:41:42,226 --> 01:41:42,747
And again, you know,

1350
01:41:43,579 --> 01:41:45,402
not looking for any sort of special credit here.

1351
01:41:45,782 --> 01:41:49,188
But oftentimes, especially over the past year, you know, I've been coming in here early and

1352
01:41:49,718 --> 01:41:54,860
putting the chairs back in order and making sure that there's room for people to sit and Larry's been helping me out the clerks can help me out.

1353
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:13,387
And you know it looks great in here without every voting machine in the city in the room, and every chair and table in the city in the room, but I wish that that level of respect and consideration was given for when we or the school committee or any board and commission does the business of the city in this room, week in and week out and not just when the mayor wants to throw a party.

1354
01:42:14,687 --> 01:42:23,469
That's, you know, it just is, I'm glad that there's been some improvements made, but, you know, this is, I agree with Councilor Scarpelli, this is not a closet.

1355
01:42:23,709 --> 01:42:32,271
And I think this also goes back to some of the issues where, you know, storage rooms in this city hall have not been kept in the condition that they need to be kept in to store things.

1356
01:42:32,751 --> 01:42:34,771
And, you know, that wasn't addressed promptly either.

1357
01:42:34,851 --> 01:42:37,892
So I just hope this room doesn't fill up again with stuff.

1358
01:42:38,432 --> 01:42:39,232
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1359
01:42:39,716 --> 01:42:53,868
In the same vein of things, I've talked with city staff for the last few months and with residents who'd like to see us, you know, update some of the decorations that we have in terms of, you know, who we're, you know, featuring in the city hall.

1360
01:42:55,049 --> 01:43:05,538
You know, they're great historical figures that we pay respect to, but I think a lot of residents would like to see their neighbors on there as well and to see us have, you know, portraits

1361
01:43:08,794 --> 01:43:13,295
decorations that are more representative of the diversity of our community.

1362
01:43:14,015 --> 01:43:14,815
Thank you, Councilor Singh.

1363
01:43:16,076 --> 01:43:16,536
Councilor Knight.

1364
01:43:16,716 --> 01:43:23,957
And on that note, Councilor Singh, I mean, you have me about one inch away from filing an amendment for this paper to bring back Frosty.

1365
01:43:24,918 --> 01:43:26,358
So thanks for bringing that up.

1366
01:43:29,899 --> 01:43:30,819
Any further discussion?

1367
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:35,120
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by

1368
01:43:36,733 --> 01:43:38,054
Councilor Carviel, all those in favor?

1369
01:43:38,074 --> 01:43:39,415
All those opposed?

1370
01:43:39,475 --> 01:43:40,256
Motion passes.

1371
01:43:40,276 --> 01:43:43,438
22-588 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1372
01:43:43,498 --> 01:43:51,805
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council stop all requests for any work performed by KP Law until we receive a budget breakdown on what KP Law services have cost our community.

1373
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:52,565
Councilor Scarpelli.

1374
01:43:52,846 --> 01:43:53,826
Thank you, Madam President.

1375
01:43:53,926 --> 01:44:03,354
And I know that to beat a dead horse here, but I understand that we have to do a business, but until we take a hard line and understanding

1376
01:44:04,273 --> 01:44:19,895
the finances of our community and especially what's going out to KP Law and especially the fact that there really is no urgency to hire a city solicitor or city assistant city solicitor until we truly understand the financial implications

1377
01:44:20,529 --> 01:44:28,213
of the mayor's legal consultants, which is KP Law.

1378
01:44:28,494 --> 01:44:38,579
I was reminded by a former counselor for this resolution, just to remind us, when we voted on KP Law, if we can all remember, do all remember on the monthly costs that we were giving them?

1379
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,080
Who remembers that?

1380
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:40,981
It was $5,000.

1381
01:44:44,476 --> 01:44:46,897
I know for sure it's definitely gone past that $5,000.

1382
01:44:47,498 --> 01:44:55,862
And I know that there's been talk that this is the frustrating part of being a city councilor.

1383
01:44:56,502 --> 01:45:06,648
We're now moving in, excuse me, other communities where I work in the municipality, we are already in the middle of our budget talks for May and June.

1384
01:45:07,368 --> 01:45:07,928
We're all in it.

1385
01:45:09,752 --> 01:45:12,113
The directors already met with financial director a few times.

1386
01:45:12,433 --> 01:45:13,154
We're ready to go.

1387
01:45:13,174 --> 01:45:18,176
We've already given our predictions, what our staff wants to, what they're looking for as a wishlist.

1388
01:45:18,516 --> 01:45:19,897
We're already all in.

1389
01:45:20,677 --> 01:45:24,839
What we're seeing right now is we still haven't seen one financial paper.

1390
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:32,103
And I don't know if there's a reason for it because one of the common denominators is that we've asked for

1391
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:39,053
the understanding or the amount of money that has been paid out to KP Law.

1392
01:45:39,453 --> 01:45:57,377
So what I'm requesting from my fellow counselors to follow my lead in asking you to please refrain from asking for resolutions that ask for legal opinion from KP Law or legal opinion because the legal opinion that asks for KP Law, at least that

1393
01:45:57,997 --> 01:46:11,260
You know, I appreciate Councilor Knight that followed up on his resolution that he responded with asking for the city solicitor to give us an answer, knowing we don't have a city solicitor.

1394
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:24,042
And I will be public and transparent that I've reached out to a few former city solicitors that I've worked with, and I've asked them,

1395
01:46:25,476 --> 01:46:26,256
if they would apply.

1396
01:46:26,276 --> 01:46:28,017
And please help us.

1397
01:46:28,298 --> 01:46:36,202
And and I said, I know we know we've been told by administration that it's difficult because it's a fight throughout the Commonwealth.

1398
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:42,726
And the answer I got from city solicitors that I worked with the now in different communities.

1399
01:46:43,546 --> 01:46:46,788
It's a George has nothing to do with

1400
01:46:48,244 --> 01:46:56,009
the shortage right now, it's the fear of what they're hearing of what's happening to department heads in this community.

1401
01:46:56,589 --> 01:47:07,676
So I think that we should start looking at things straight on and figuring things out because things are getting, things have gotten away from us in this community.

1402
01:47:08,236 --> 01:47:09,457
We're in crisis.

1403
01:47:10,718 --> 01:47:11,418
We're in crisis.

1404
01:47:12,018 --> 01:47:14,520
So I think the more that we support

1405
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:21,343
The mayor's initiatives, especially with KP Law, the more we're giving evidence, the more we're showing, and I know it's tough.

1406
01:47:21,403 --> 01:47:25,827
I know that we're trying to do our business, but the truth of the matter is, are they really answering us?

1407
01:47:26,448 --> 01:47:28,530
Even when we ask, are they really getting back to us?

1408
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:31,572
Are they really giving the answers that we need to help us succeed?

1409
01:47:32,493 --> 01:47:33,033
I say no.

1410
01:47:33,654 --> 01:47:38,958
I haven't seen, you know, we've done a lot of work, and Council President, I credit you with a lot of meetings.

1411
01:47:39,419 --> 01:47:40,159
We're doing a lot.

1412
01:47:40,860 --> 01:47:44,121
but we seem to not to get anything done because where does it fall?

1413
01:47:44,841 --> 01:47:46,542
It falls for when it gets to legal opinion.

1414
01:47:47,242 --> 01:47:55,865
So, um, again, everybody has their opinion, but I asked my fellow colleagues to share with my motion.

1415
01:47:56,045 --> 01:47:56,365
Thank you.

1416
01:47:56,645 --> 01:47:57,545
Thank you, Councilor Pele.

1417
01:47:57,645 --> 01:47:58,265
Vice Mayor Behrs.

1418
01:47:58,945 --> 01:47:59,746
Thank you, Madam President.

1419
01:48:00,850 --> 01:48:02,490
And I completely support the spirit of this.

1420
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:04,951
And it's more for me, how do we make it actionable?

1421
01:48:04,971 --> 01:48:10,772
Because I think we share all the frustration with KP law and not having a solicitor, not having an assistant solicitor.

1422
01:48:10,832 --> 01:48:17,054
And, you know, some of us went to some pretty extreme lengths in June to get that back.

1423
01:48:17,834 --> 01:48:21,035
I think as we all remember being here at one in the morning when it was finally resolved.

1424
01:48:22,906 --> 01:48:31,492
And it was, you know, that's what it takes right now in Medford to get an answer is to be sitting here at one in the morning discussing something that nobody wants to do.

1425
01:48:33,114 --> 01:48:44,182
However, you know, we have a December meeting scheduled plan we do have the ongoing BJ's lawsuit and I'm just trying to understand the scope here right like, you know, I know that.

1426
01:48:44,978 --> 01:48:53,986
The President Murrell has been working closely with with the administration and quite frankly with KP law specific lawyer from KP law around BJ's and that's coming up in January.

1427
01:48:54,587 --> 01:48:56,889
And I don't want to see us sitting without a representative there.

1428
01:48:57,949 --> 01:49:05,136
So, you know, my suggestion would be to twofold because again, I completely agree that this is an unacceptable situation.

1429
01:49:05,937 --> 01:49:09,660
And we've seen what's happened in previous situations where legal representation wasn't here.

1430
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:17,183
at that time because we only had one solicitor and she was deeply overworked and wasn't able to attend our meetings because of all the legal issues that were coming from the administration.

1431
01:49:18,364 --> 01:49:20,724
What happens sometimes when we get into that situation?

1432
01:49:22,105 --> 01:49:33,970
Could we amend this that we request that finance director Dickinson appear at our December 20th meeting with the, and basically present three things.

1433
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:35,431
One, the

1434
01:49:39,598 --> 01:49:43,240
report the quarter report that we had requested and we're told we were going to get in mid-November.

1435
01:49:43,980 --> 01:49:49,882
Two, that the warrant articles finally be placed on our agenda as we requested and that Director Dickinson said that he could make that possible.

1436
01:49:50,442 --> 01:50:00,827
And three, and this is new so I'll try to say it slowly so the clerk can get it down, the third piece would be that we get a

1437
01:50:02,115 --> 01:50:09,639
amount expended on legal services in fiscal year 22, and the amount expended on legal services so far in fiscal 23.

1438
01:50:09,899 --> 01:50:15,321
Because I know for a fact in fiscal 23, that number is going to be basically all KP law.

1439
01:50:15,681 --> 01:50:18,863
And then we'll know how much we're actually spending on KP law.

1440
01:50:20,383 --> 01:50:30,508
And after that point, if we don't get that presentation and those answers at that meeting, I would support something to the effect of stop all requests except essential urgent legal work.

1441
01:50:32,721 --> 01:50:35,702
That would be my other amendment that we... I would support that.

1442
01:50:36,442 --> 01:50:51,287
I understand that we do need some protection when you talk about BJs, but again, I'd love to support that with bringing in Mr. Dickinson and see where we are.

1443
01:50:51,507 --> 01:50:52,267
So thank you.

1444
01:50:52,487 --> 01:50:53,387
Thank you, Councilor Scarbelli.

1445
01:50:53,407 --> 01:50:54,187
And again, appreciate it.

1446
01:50:54,207 --> 01:50:55,328
Thank you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Carvilla.

1447
01:50:57,763 --> 01:51:01,032
Thank you, President Roehl, and I appreciate the dialogue so far.

1448
01:51:01,052 --> 01:51:03,238
I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

1449
01:51:04,421 --> 01:51:05,604
Like Vice President Behrs, I

1450
01:51:06,477 --> 01:51:08,918
I'm glad about the spirit of this resolution.

1451
01:51:08,998 --> 01:51:18,961
I had similar reservations about doing it by the text offered in the main paper, which the amendment offered, I think I'd be much more comfortable with.

1452
01:51:19,001 --> 01:51:26,223
I think that everybody behind this rail, this really feels that frustration of asking for this information over and over and not getting it.

1453
01:51:27,584 --> 01:51:30,805
And also the frustration of trying to work with KP Law, a lawyer that

1454
01:51:31,895 --> 01:51:46,347
is not beholden to us or working exclusively with us and getting extremely variable responses to our requests for legal counsel, which I will not enumerate, but I will if anybody asks me specifically.

1455
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:50,070
I was going to mention

1456
01:51:54,442 --> 01:51:59,584
well, in the spirit of the amendment that's been offered, I think that, you know, the buck has to stop somewhere.

1457
01:51:59,604 --> 01:52:02,245
I think this is an appropriate next step to make.

1458
01:52:03,266 --> 01:52:07,827
I think we can, I think we have demonstrated, I think we'll continue to demonstrate to the administration that we are

1459
01:52:09,688 --> 01:52:21,857
extremely serious about getting a city solicitor, assistant city solicitor that will be accountable to us for the council to stop all work that requires legal review right here and now before another escalating step.

1460
01:52:22,317 --> 01:52:29,262
You know, not to sound overly cynical, but I could see that being a real gift for the administration in the way that goes against what we're trying to do here.

1461
01:52:29,282 --> 01:52:36,467
Prior to June of this year, you know, we heard multiple times an alleged rationale for why we didn't really need an independent council.

1462
01:52:37,128 --> 01:52:38,289
The summer we started hearing

1463
01:52:39,886 --> 01:52:40,086
that.

1464
01:52:40,106 --> 01:52:40,266
Um.

1465
01:52:41,227 --> 01:52:46,132
Commentary about the fact that we would try to produce two whole ordinances per year.

1466
01:52:46,652 --> 01:52:49,355
I want us to keep making the case that this city council is.

1467
01:52:50,135 --> 01:52:51,597
By law, a legislative body.

1468
01:52:51,817 --> 01:52:55,140
We will legislate to create the policies that this community deserves.

1469
01:52:55,540 --> 01:52:57,202
I want us to keep doing that through December.

1470
01:52:58,243 --> 01:53:02,487
If we don't get you know the reasonable accommodations that we're asking for, you know, then I

1471
01:53:07,854 --> 01:53:08,514
Thank you, Mr. Collins.

1472
01:53:08,534 --> 01:53:09,674
Councilor Kerrio.

1473
01:53:09,694 --> 01:53:11,035
Thank you, Madam President.

1474
01:53:11,875 --> 01:53:19,017
If Councilor Bares wouldn't mind amending it to add years 20 and 21 which we've asked for.

1475
01:53:19,037 --> 01:53:30,500
I don't even, I don't even know how many times we've asked for that so if Councilor Bares, if you could ask for 20 and 20 and 21 also, I mean we, we have no idea.

1476
01:53:31,293 --> 01:53:43,639
I mean, I think we're all hearing rumors of numbers of what KP Law is and their bill is, but like Councilor Collins said, we're getting inconsistent advice.

1477
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:46,340
We're getting a different person every time.

1478
01:53:46,681 --> 01:53:52,343
And every time we have a meeting, our subcommittee meetings, I mean, all we're doing is driving the bill up also.

1479
01:53:52,383 --> 01:53:59,347
We're just as bad as anyone else because they're coming on here on a Wednesday night or Tuesday night, whatever night we're having.

1480
01:54:00,297 --> 01:54:05,381
And I'm sure they're not working for $100 an hour on these meetings.

1481
01:54:05,401 --> 01:54:06,241
There must be some kind of man.

1482
01:54:06,261 --> 01:54:14,828
But like I say, if Councilor Behrs wouldn't mind adding on 20 and 21, which we probably asked for maybe 10, at least 10 more times.

1483
01:54:14,848 --> 01:54:17,009
Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

1484
01:54:18,010 --> 01:54:25,015
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Vice President Behrs, amended by Councilor Carviello.

1485
01:54:26,336 --> 01:54:28,478
So Mr. Clerk, could you please read back the motion?

1486
01:54:33,272 --> 01:54:35,746
There's an amendment from vice president bears requesting.

1487
01:54:37,632 --> 01:54:47,758
requesting that the finance director be present at the December 20th meeting to present the quarterly reports and also to present the warrant articles that should be placed on the agenda.

1488
01:54:48,518 --> 01:54:55,902
And there's a third request to get the amount spent on legal services in FY22 and so far in FY23.

1489
01:54:56,002 --> 01:55:02,786
And then there's an amendment from Councilor Caravaglia requesting also the amount spent on legal expenses in FY20 and FY21.

1490
01:55:04,825 --> 01:55:05,465
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

1491
01:55:05,485 --> 01:55:06,906
Do I have a second on that?

1492
01:55:08,547 --> 01:55:13,689
So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, amended by Vice Mayor Behrs and Councilor Carvillo, as seconded by Councilor Carvillo.

1493
01:55:13,849 --> 01:55:14,589
All those in favor?

1494
01:55:15,369 --> 01:55:16,170
All those opposed?

1495
01:55:16,210 --> 01:55:17,050
The motion passes.

1496
01:55:17,070 --> 01:55:27,715
22-589 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the chief of staff appear at our next meeting to guide us on how we can have a better form of communication with our city partners.

1497
01:55:27,795 --> 01:55:28,475
Councilor Scarpelli.

1498
01:55:29,533 --> 01:55:30,374
Thank you, Madam President.

1499
01:55:30,814 --> 01:55:31,294
Very simple.

1500
01:55:31,314 --> 01:55:48,806
This was when I wrote this, it was a few weeks back, and this was in conjunction with the horrifying situation for that young lady that endured the beating at Bedford High School and the lack of communication we got from the school department.

1501
01:55:51,585 --> 01:55:58,570
I know that, you know, when I was in the school committee, one thing that we made sure that the superintendent reached out to all the stakeholders.

1502
01:55:58,631 --> 01:56:08,798
And I know that when I was a school committee, we made sure that our city councils knew when something very important happened in the school department, that we would be getting phone calls, especially something that dire.

1503
01:56:09,359 --> 01:56:11,861
And, um, we, we didn't get anything.

1504
01:56:11,901 --> 01:56:19,026
I think we got a, uh, something that was added to a, um, go Mustang page and then something in it.

1505
01:56:19,246 --> 01:56:19,587
It wasn't,

1506
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:27,865
It wasn't anything that we were alerted to because it's something that at that level.

1507
01:56:28,005 --> 01:56:28,986
Now, don't get me wrong.

1508
01:56:29,306 --> 01:56:34,510
We have a student that has an accident in the gym class.

1509
01:56:35,591 --> 01:56:40,434
As a school committee member, I got a phone call saying, George, just so that you know, the ambulance just left from the Glynn School.

1510
01:56:40,814 --> 01:56:44,817
We had a young person break their wrist in phys ed at basketball.

1511
01:56:45,277 --> 01:56:45,938
Thank you.

1512
01:56:46,198 --> 01:56:48,860
I understand it's on the school committee side, just on the city side.

1513
01:56:49,619 --> 01:57:11,364
we should be informed with issues that, especially dealing with the horrific issue that was brought to that situation, and newspapers and news trucks, and we're getting phone calls from news outlets, and we're getting phone calls from parents, but I don't know what you're talking about.

1514
01:57:11,724 --> 01:57:14,045
And they said, how do you not know what we're talking about?

1515
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:16,946
So again,

1516
01:57:18,985 --> 01:57:22,788
It's something that I find very disheartening, so I think that's why that was put in.

1517
01:57:22,848 --> 01:57:27,232
So thank you for hearing my cry, Madam President.

1518
01:57:27,572 --> 01:57:28,533
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1519
01:57:28,613 --> 01:57:29,854
Any further discussion from the Council?

1520
01:57:31,595 --> 01:57:34,718
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1521
01:57:34,738 --> 01:57:35,378
All those in favor?

1522
01:57:35,398 --> 01:57:36,839
All those opposed?

1523
01:57:36,879 --> 01:57:37,520
Motion passes.

1524
01:57:38,685 --> 01:57:54,313
22 dash 590 offered by vice president bears be it so resolved by the Metro City Council that the elections manager and Elections Commission provide the council with an after action report on November 22 general election, be it for the result of this report include any complaints challenges or issues that occurred throughout the entire election process.

1525
01:57:54,921 --> 01:58:02,845
impacts of the new staff and leadership structure and how the elections department plans to improve the process and conduct more voter outreach and engagement going forward.

1526
01:58:03,445 --> 01:58:04,145
Vice President Behrs.

1527
01:58:04,225 --> 01:58:05,066
Thank you, Madam President.

1528
01:58:05,426 --> 01:58:12,249
Something that we've done since the beginning of this term and towards the end of last term was working as a council to improve the governance of our elections.

1529
01:58:12,289 --> 01:58:14,250
And one way that we did that was by adopting

1530
01:58:14,967 --> 01:58:18,529
modern provision of mass general law to move us to an elections commission model.

1531
01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:25,932
And that new commission was appointed and then confirmed by this council in the spring of this year.

1532
01:58:25,952 --> 01:58:35,717
I will add that then the mayor later decided after the September primary to make a staffing change and change who was in charge of the elections department

1533
01:58:36,248 --> 01:58:43,290
So essentially, I just want to point that out because the department has gone through an entire change of both governance and lead staffing within one year.

1534
01:58:43,310 --> 01:58:50,832
The September primary, which, as we know, had some very close election results, went off seemingly without a hitch.

1535
01:58:52,092 --> 01:58:55,113
However, there in the November election, you know, there were a number of issues that

1536
01:58:55,892 --> 01:59:06,001
were reported to me, and that I saw directly around some incomplete information being released on election night, you know, where the early votes and the mail votes were not released on election night.

1537
01:59:06,541 --> 01:59:09,604
So there was some confusion as to what the what the results are.

1538
01:59:09,664 --> 01:59:11,606
Luckily, there were no close local elections.

1539
01:59:12,666 --> 01:59:22,575
But I'm sure if there had been that there would have been a significant outcry regarding the fact that the results that were unofficial, yes, but released on election night anyway, were not entirely complete.

1540
01:59:23,445 --> 01:59:33,268
I know that at my polling location and at a number of other polling locations that poll workers who I spoke to had some concerns about understaffing and difficulty getting poll workers.

1541
01:59:34,268 --> 01:59:40,530
And I also know for a fact after the election, I've heard from a number of poll workers that they've not been paid completely for the hours that they've been worked.

1542
01:59:40,570 --> 01:59:44,331
And that's still true, at least as of later at the end of last week.

1543
01:59:45,441 --> 01:59:47,062
So, you know, those are some significant issues.

1544
01:59:47,102 --> 01:59:58,069
You know, I have no doubt in the confidence of the actual results of the election, but I think procedurally and engagement wise, we need to hear from our elections manager and our new elections commission.

1545
01:59:58,729 --> 02:00:02,151
How are they planning to improve the process around the election going forward?

1546
02:00:02,572 --> 02:00:13,278
We're going into a municipal election cycle where we're not gonna have support from the secretary of state's office that we have in an even year election that's a state election and a number of other things, you know,

1547
02:00:13,853 --> 02:00:17,195
I do believe that there's a shared commitment, certainly within this council, to make improvements.

1548
02:00:17,235 --> 02:00:18,536
That's what we've been focusing on.

1549
02:00:18,576 --> 02:00:23,079
How can we make sure that this department has the resources and the governance structure it needs to succeed?

1550
02:00:23,759 --> 02:00:40,170
And I think providing us with a report and having a discussion with us about how are we gonna make sure that all of the different pieces, big and small, of the election process go off smoothly, and that the elections department can do that outreach to make sure that we are increasing voter turnout as much as we can is incredibly important.

1551
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:43,512
So that's the intent of this resolution, and I ask my colleagues for their support.

1552
02:00:44,317 --> 02:00:46,218
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

1553
02:00:46,798 --> 02:00:51,620
Any further discussion from the council on the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1554
02:00:52,021 --> 02:00:52,681
All those in favor?

1555
02:00:53,361 --> 02:00:53,962
All those opposed?

1556
02:00:54,002 --> 02:00:54,622
Motion passes.

1557
02:00:56,065 --> 02:00:57,647
22-591 offered by Councillor Knight.

1558
02:00:58,188 --> 02:01:00,670
Whereas there's no advice and consent procedures relative.

1559
02:01:02,092 --> 02:01:04,454
On the motion, paper withdrawn.

1560
02:01:04,574 --> 02:01:08,759
Paper 22-591 has been withdrawn by Councillor Knight.

1561
02:01:08,779 --> 02:01:09,800
22-592 offered by Councillor Knight.

1562
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:15,506
Be it so resolved that the Director of Veteran Services establish a hotline to address questions related to the much publicized Camp Lejeune

1563
02:01:15,983 --> 02:01:19,325
water contamination lawsuit in the interest of consumer protection.

1564
02:01:19,385 --> 02:01:19,885
Counselor Knight.

1565
02:01:20,406 --> 02:01:30,972
Madam President, one of the benefits of working remotely is that I have the opportunity to see the Camp Lejeune water contamination lawsuit commercial 600 times a day.

1566
02:01:32,433 --> 02:01:40,478
And that would lead me to believe, if I'm seeing it that much, many of our veterans who are elderly in nature are seeing it as well.

1567
02:01:40,818 --> 02:01:44,000
And as we are all aware, whenever something like this comes up,

1568
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,463
The scam calls usually come along with them.

1569
02:01:47,203 --> 02:02:04,063
So I was hoping that a veteran service director could set up a hotline for individuals to access that may be looking for information relative to the Camp Lejeune water contamination lawsuit, in an interest to protect them from scamming, phishing, spamming, phishing, and the like.

1570
02:02:04,123 --> 02:02:04,744
I mean, ultimately,

1571
02:02:05,124 --> 02:02:06,585
It's something we see out there every day.

1572
02:02:06,645 --> 02:02:10,106
You know, the social attacks are more and more common.

1573
02:02:10,546 --> 02:02:19,931
And I think it's important for us to take the steps necessary to provide our residents with the protections and safeguards that we can't, especially when something like this is being brought up.

1574
02:02:20,031 --> 02:02:22,812
Ultimately, it's a lawsuit that addresses

1575
02:02:23,747 --> 02:02:36,578
Parkinson's disease, cancer, and various other diseases that come along with the exposure to various contaminants, which would also lead one to believe that some of these individuals may not be in the best of health, which would make them even more vulnerable.

1576
02:02:37,158 --> 02:02:42,763
So I'd ask that this correspondence be forwarded to the veteran service director with the support of my colleagues.

1577
02:02:43,263 --> 02:02:43,864
Thank you, councilor.

1578
02:02:43,924 --> 02:02:47,127
I do see, so we did get a response from the veteran services director.

1579
02:02:47,167 --> 02:02:51,030
I do see you probably didn't get it because it went to the council member list, but I do not believe you.

1580
02:02:51,783 --> 02:02:58,267
Yeah, sometimes he did say that folks calling that his office number, he can absolutely speak to this.

1581
02:02:59,168 --> 02:03:01,750
The City of Medford Veteran Services number is 781-393-2505.

1582
02:03:01,870 --> 02:03:10,856
He can address the questions relating to the PACT Act of 2022 with the provision known as the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022.

1583
02:03:11,696 --> 02:03:15,239
Whenever an interested party gives a number of call, he responds to voicemails and emails.

1584
02:03:15,739 --> 02:03:18,461
Folks can also email him at jjohns at medford-ma.gov.

1585
02:03:20,383 --> 02:03:24,064
I'd just like to amend the paper matter present to ask that that be published on the Vetted Services website.

1586
02:03:24,344 --> 02:03:24,744
Absolutely.

1587
02:03:25,924 --> 02:03:28,564
So on them, any further discussion from the council?

1588
02:03:28,784 --> 02:03:32,905
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1589
02:03:32,945 --> 02:03:33,665
All those in favor?

1590
02:03:34,305 --> 02:03:35,646
All those opposed?

1591
02:03:35,666 --> 02:03:38,746
Motion passes.

1592
02:03:38,766 --> 02:03:45,327
22-593, offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Carviello, be it so resolved that the Medford Police Department reinstate their monthly traveling information sessions.

1593
02:03:45,427 --> 02:03:45,927
Councilor Knight.

1594
02:03:46,348 --> 02:03:47,808
I would certainly defer to the senior member.

1595
02:03:48,368 --> 02:03:48,948
Councilor Carviello.

1596
02:03:50,279 --> 02:03:51,199
Thank you, Madam President.

1597
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:57,984
It's a program started by former Councilor Falco some years ago, and it was a pretty successful program.

1598
02:03:58,024 --> 02:04:11,993
We'd have quarterly meetings at different schools in different neighborhoods with the police chief and the police officers, and yielded some good results, and it got some neighbors into the community to ask questions about what was going on in the community, and the chief

1599
02:04:13,048 --> 02:04:14,949
Chief Sacco was great with it.

1600
02:04:14,969 --> 02:04:29,152
There was always going to be a contingent of officers there to give the residents a chance to air their concerns and also for the police to let the residents know what was going on in their community.

1601
02:04:29,172 --> 02:04:31,933
So I would like to see this brought back.

1602
02:04:32,813 --> 02:04:33,493
I have no problem.

1603
02:04:34,371 --> 02:04:38,016
helping out with it and going to them if need be.

1604
02:04:38,436 --> 02:04:43,022
It was a good program done by Councilor Falco, and I would like to see it brought back.

1605
02:04:52,487 --> 02:04:57,871
So on the motion of Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor Carviello, all those in favour?

1606
02:04:58,171 --> 02:04:58,912
All those opposed?

1607
02:04:58,992 --> 02:04:59,652
Motion passes.

1608
02:04:59,672 --> 02:05:03,875
22-594 offered by Councillor Knight, Councillor Carviello and Councillor Scarpelli.

1609
02:05:04,416 --> 02:05:11,721
Be it so resolved that the Metro parking department implement monthly traveling information sessions based upon the framework previously utilized by the police department.

1610
02:05:13,082 --> 02:05:14,203
Councillor Carviello, Councillor Knight.

1611
02:05:14,703 --> 02:05:15,744
Once again, I'm the first senior member.

1612
02:05:16,084 --> 02:05:16,724
Councillor Carviello.

1613
02:05:17,565 --> 02:05:18,866
Thank you, Madam President.

1614
02:05:18,886 --> 02:05:19,987
Similar to the other resolution,

1615
02:05:21,411 --> 02:05:25,645
Where the parking department is moving ahead in leaps and bounds, especially now where

1616
02:05:26,638 --> 02:05:32,963
they're implementing parking programs and resident parking in different neighborhoods around the train stations.

1617
02:05:33,724 --> 02:05:43,312
I would think that this is a very good idea and they should be going into the neighborhoods where they've drawn their circle around the parking permit areas.

1618
02:05:43,672 --> 02:05:45,473
So I would support this whole heartedly.

1619
02:05:45,493 --> 02:05:52,139
And I would say this should start now as again, as they're going around

1620
02:05:52,779 --> 02:06:04,570
figuring out which streets are going to do resident parking, because I received calls from the residents that they think they're way too far away from the station, and about their parking situation.

1621
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:05,911
So I support this a lot.

1622
02:06:06,372 --> 02:06:06,672
Thank you.

1623
02:06:07,012 --> 02:06:07,813
Councilor Knight.

1624
02:06:07,853 --> 02:06:15,460
Madam President, ultimately, our parking department is destined to fail if we keep operating the way we are currently operating.

1625
02:06:16,281 --> 02:06:17,702
We need to do something a little bit different.

1626
02:06:19,177 --> 02:06:26,319
Outreach, we're all outraged about the outreach from Eversource, but our parking department goes and throws up meters all over the place without talking to anybody in the neighborhood.

1627
02:06:27,159 --> 02:06:28,580
It doesn't make sense to me, right?

1628
02:06:28,980 --> 02:06:30,520
What's good for the goose is good for the gander.

1629
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:36,862
We should be holding our own employees to the same standards that we're holding those private contracts that are coming into the city to do business as well.

1630
02:06:37,862 --> 02:06:40,363
I just had the opportunity to have a correspondence with the foreman.

1631
02:06:41,123 --> 02:06:45,644
of the parking department and I asked him to meet with an individual who's working right across the street.

1632
02:06:45,784 --> 02:06:51,625
As a matter of fact, at 99 Riverside Ave, they're doing some construction work to the affordable housing units there.

1633
02:06:52,145 --> 02:07:03,448
And I asked the foreman to meet with the superintendent of the construction job for the simple purpose of understanding what the parking rules and regulations are in the region and where he could park his trucks.

1634
02:07:04,508 --> 02:07:05,668
I sent that email to the foreman.

1635
02:07:06,066 --> 02:07:07,148
The foreman never responded.

1636
02:07:07,168 --> 02:07:13,917
I got an email from the director, CC'd with the mayor, with Nina, with the DPW director and the city engineer.

1637
02:07:15,099 --> 02:07:17,483
All right, this department's never gonna work.

1638
02:07:18,464 --> 02:07:22,210
It's never gonna work if the foreman can't pick up the phone and talk to somebody on the street.

1639
02:07:23,596 --> 02:07:26,598
All right, that's what those offices are for, the foot patrol offices, right?

1640
02:07:26,638 --> 02:07:28,319
They're down there, the parking enforcement offices.

1641
02:07:28,340 --> 02:07:31,702
They're supposed to communicate with the individuals that are in this community.

1642
02:07:32,943 --> 02:07:39,448
So ultimately, I think that there is a very significant lack of communication coming out of that office.

1643
02:07:39,928 --> 02:07:46,213
There's a significant lack of understanding among many of the residents in the neighborhood, what's expected of them.

1644
02:07:46,933 --> 02:07:55,940
And there's a haphazard application of the enforcement policy that keeps people a little bit concerned about the way things are going.

1645
02:07:56,400 --> 02:08:00,764
So with that being said, I support the resolution wholeheartedly and thank my colleagues for joining me in supporting it.

1646
02:08:01,124 --> 02:08:01,404
Thank you.

1647
02:08:02,185 --> 02:08:03,266
Thank you, Madam President.

1648
02:08:03,386 --> 02:08:04,747
Thanks for my colleagues.

1649
02:08:04,767 --> 02:08:11,252
I think that I'm looking at this in a different way that we can look at it and showing showing our community how this can work.

1650
02:08:12,081 --> 02:08:13,262
by going out in the community.

1651
02:08:13,322 --> 02:08:35,478
I know that, you know, like I'll say it again, I hate to say it, but when you're working in a community, in a municipality, when you want something to change, you want something to happen, you go through the community, you set up round table events where people come out and share what their concerns are, and then the rebuttal or the communication back and forth to make sure this works.

1652
02:08:36,139 --> 02:08:40,382
Now, traffic and parking fees and fines in our neighbor community,

1653
02:08:41,177 --> 02:08:47,041
people were outraged after they went through roundtable discussions to each neighborhood.

1654
02:08:47,982 --> 02:09:04,213
And they came back and they said, okay, so you're saying these fees and fines are going to go directly to our school system, that our roads will be swept on a daily basis and our playgrounds will be safe and clean.

1655
02:09:05,735 --> 02:09:06,995
Well, let's see.

1656
02:09:07,976 --> 02:09:09,157
And that's what happened.

1657
02:09:10,222 --> 02:09:23,115
So the big conundrum, the big issue and concerns, the negativity was put to rest once people really understand where the benefits are and where that can go.

1658
02:09:24,196 --> 02:09:30,322
Unfortunately, what we're hearing over and over again is the lack of communication to who?

1659
02:09:31,323 --> 02:09:34,346
The citizens of this community and

1660
02:09:36,122 --> 02:09:48,773
That's where I agree with Councilor Knight that this cannot work and this won't work unless we have a way that we can turn to each other and say, this is how, why this is happening.

1661
02:09:48,833 --> 02:09:54,338
Now, granted, when you're sitting in front of someone to tell them you're gonna raise fees and fines, they're gonna look you in the eye and tell you they're wrong.

1662
02:09:55,478 --> 02:09:59,322
But ultimately, you made the decision to explain it and you move forward.

1663
02:09:59,522 --> 02:10:00,363
We have yet to do that.

1664
02:10:01,032 --> 02:10:01,673
in many things.

1665
02:10:02,573 --> 02:10:13,442
My phone's been blowing up about how people were part of this dog commission, and this is something that, and Brookline, how things change and shame on you, and this is wrong.

1666
02:10:14,243 --> 02:10:16,044
Fine, fine.

1667
02:10:17,265 --> 02:10:20,448
I've talked to 30 of my neighbors that asked about this dog situation.

1668
02:10:20,948 --> 02:10:27,874
They don't live in Brookline, they don't walk their dog off a leash, and there's a huge lack of communication in this community.

1669
02:10:29,818 --> 02:10:31,900
The last two resolutions speak volumes.

1670
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:41,849
I think we saw a huge, huge difference with the relationship with the police and neighborhood policing when council Falco made this motion to move it to neighborhoods.

1671
02:10:41,869 --> 02:10:50,577
And we actually joked about it because council Falco every week would give a summary and say, don't forget community policing will be held this night in this location.

1672
02:10:50,978 --> 02:10:52,379
And you want, you want to know the truth?

1673
02:10:53,524 --> 02:10:57,065
The police loved it, and the neighborhood loved it because that always filled the room.

1674
02:10:57,505 --> 02:11:01,806
And they sat there, and like Chief used to say, they used to take it.

1675
02:11:02,787 --> 02:11:05,707
And then when they were left, they were shaking hands saying, oh, now I understand.

1676
02:11:06,468 --> 02:11:07,528
And boy, does that help.

1677
02:11:08,428 --> 02:11:11,629
So communication is key for success in anything we do in life.

1678
02:11:12,069 --> 02:11:16,570
And what we're lacking right now in this city is a true lack of communication.

1679
02:11:16,630 --> 02:11:18,131
So I think these resolutions help.

1680
02:11:18,151 --> 02:11:21,232
So thank you to my colleagues to support if they will.

1681
02:11:21,872 --> 02:11:22,152
Thank you.

1682
02:11:22,172 --> 02:11:22,792
Vice President Behrs.

1683
02:11:23,443 --> 02:11:24,184
Thank you, Madam President.

1684
02:11:24,484 --> 02:11:46,980
And I think this and many other issues go right back to what we were talking about with Eversource and Mr. Wartella, which is, you know, what has the parking department been tasked to do and who is leading the implementation of a plan and making sure that there is communication going on and constituent service work going on so that the outreach is happening and that there's capacity to do that.

1685
02:11:47,681 --> 02:11:48,942
And I think what's clear here is

1686
02:11:50,308 --> 02:11:54,969
that the parking department was, you know, we haven't even gotten to raising fees and fines yet that's not even on the table.

1687
02:11:55,509 --> 02:12:03,531
We're just talking about, you know, some adjustments to permitting some, some adjustments to increase enforcement some changes to the infrastructural system.

1688
02:12:04,131 --> 02:12:11,813
We haven't really gotten to fundamentally deep changes on a city wide basis around parking enforcement right now I think the parking department

1689
02:12:12,387 --> 02:12:19,071
has been given, in many ways, not the guidance and planning and resources that they've needed to be successful.

1690
02:12:19,631 --> 02:12:23,353
And I don't think they've been told, here are the communications outlets.

1691
02:12:24,273 --> 02:12:25,454
It's been start from scratch.

1692
02:12:25,514 --> 02:12:26,975
It's start from scratch every time.

1693
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:37,647
You have a planning department with its own email list, a rec department with its own email list, a health department with its own email list, a mayor with their own email list, and none of it is communicating with each other.

1694
02:12:37,667 --> 02:12:47,133
You don't have an integrated communications infrastructure to support our departments, to support the idea of reaching out to folks in different communities around a whole host of issues.

1695
02:12:48,894 --> 02:13:04,105
You know, I think that's really where this needs to come in with a collaborative approach to bring all hands together and say, who in this city is, you know, working in constituent services and what support do they need on a citywide basis and what citywide infrastructure are we doing to make sure that they can do outreach.

1696
02:13:04,765 --> 02:13:06,247
Same goes for communications.

1697
02:13:07,649 --> 02:13:17,214
And I think also goes for decision making and planning around projects like the meter project or decision about how we're gonna, you know, what is our city policy around the Eversource paving?

1698
02:13:17,634 --> 02:13:19,055
All of these issues are interconnected.

1699
02:13:19,895 --> 02:13:22,936
And I think that, you know, these are good resolutions.

1700
02:13:22,996 --> 02:13:36,483
I certainly support these policies, but even information sessions, one off from the police department or one off from the parking department, I think they'll make some impact on those specific areas, but they will not get to the systemic issue that we don't have the proper infrastructure

1701
02:13:37,808 --> 02:13:49,416
around communications and constituent services, and that the leadership approach around collaboration is not there to bring the different parts of city government together to bring to bear the best results for our residents.

1702
02:13:49,536 --> 02:13:59,563
So thank you to my colleagues for putting this forward, and I really hope that we see a bigger and broader and systemic approach from the city administration.

1703
02:13:59,683 --> 02:14:03,705
Otherwise, we're gonna keep coming back here time after time again on issue after issue.

1704
02:14:04,005 --> 02:14:04,286
Thank you.

1705
02:14:07,333 --> 02:14:08,354
Thank you, President Morrell.

1706
02:14:09,314 --> 02:14:10,355
I think this was a great idea.

1707
02:14:10,375 --> 02:14:11,716
I'll be happy to support it tonight.

1708
02:14:11,876 --> 02:14:26,906
Just to echo what Vice President Behrs was just speaking to, you know, I think that as we try to improve the status quo with parking in our community, among other issues, you know, I keep coming back to

1709
02:14:28,481 --> 02:14:30,023
What were they set up to do?

1710
02:14:30,123 --> 02:14:31,164
Were they set up to succeed?

1711
02:14:31,224 --> 02:14:32,826
Were they set up to fail?

1712
02:14:33,026 --> 02:14:36,289
I think that these traveling information sessions is a great idea.

1713
02:14:36,349 --> 02:14:44,378
Actually, just earlier this week, I was talking to a constituent who actually didn't hear about the big sweep, which is something that even I hear about.

1714
02:14:44,438 --> 02:14:49,243
And I feel like I'm the last person I know about everything in the community, notwithstanding being a council member.

1715
02:14:50,804 --> 02:14:54,110
To me, that speaks to the fact that we can do as much as we're doing right now.

1716
02:14:54,170 --> 02:14:59,018
We can try to reach as many people as possible with our current communications infrastructure and staffing levels.

1717
02:14:59,579 --> 02:15:03,305
We are, it's reality, we're missing a lot of people.

1718
02:15:03,765 --> 02:15:04,587
This is going to help.

1719
02:15:05,569 --> 02:15:06,809
but it's not a systemic approach.

1720
02:15:06,949 --> 02:15:14,172
I really want to see the city administration supporting the parking department and rolling out these traveling information sessions.

1721
02:15:16,192 --> 02:15:18,593
No department crafts its own policies.

1722
02:15:18,633 --> 02:15:20,594
These are directives that are coming down from the administration.

1723
02:15:20,634 --> 02:15:24,275
If the administration wants this department to succeed, they need to help them succeed.

1724
02:15:24,955 --> 02:15:30,917
I think this is a great tactic to advance that, but it needs resources and it needs support just like the rest of their agenda.

1725
02:15:31,297 --> 02:15:31,538
Thank you.

1726
02:15:34,005 --> 02:15:39,467
I think I've long said that we shouldn't expect people to come to government.

1727
02:15:39,487 --> 02:15:41,187
We should expect government to go to people.

1728
02:15:41,868 --> 02:15:45,689
And there's a lot of work that even we can do better in this regard.

1729
02:15:45,789 --> 02:15:51,651
I thank my fellow counselors for putting this on the agenda because I think it matches that spirit entirely.

1730
02:15:51,671 --> 02:16:02,394
I just would want to offer a quick, a short amendment to add the Traffic Commission in there as well, because I know they're working on a lot of the policy changes that Councilor Caraballo brought up.

1731
02:16:03,208 --> 02:16:10,114
And I know the director of the parking department has said that she doesn't involve herself in those discussions.

1732
02:16:10,214 --> 02:16:15,079
And so it's important that we have the decision makers also traveling into the neighborhoods.

1733
02:16:17,701 --> 02:16:18,902
Is sponsors okay with that amendment?

1734
02:16:20,103 --> 02:16:20,323
Sure.

1735
02:16:20,523 --> 02:16:20,724
Great.

1736
02:16:21,624 --> 02:16:25,628
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello as amended by Councilor Sangs.

1737
02:16:35,563 --> 02:16:39,992
Great, so on the motion of Councilor Kerrio, as amended by Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Naik.

1738
02:16:41,334 --> 02:16:42,096
All those in favor?

1739
02:16:42,116 --> 02:16:42,176
Aye.

1740
02:16:42,356 --> 02:16:43,478
All those opposed?

1741
02:16:43,518 --> 02:16:44,119
Motion passes.

1742
02:16:44,963 --> 02:17:04,129
to do dash 595 offered by Council night, see if the result of the NHS SRO provide the council with a report within 30 days outlining any and all filings complaints investigation incidents and reports relative to student upon student violence in our public high school over the past 24 months, Councilor night, Madam President, this is a rather self explanatory resolution.

1743
02:17:04,789 --> 02:17:07,790
Ultimately, what I'm asking for is information relative to violence.

1744
02:17:08,740 --> 02:17:09,101
high school.

1745
02:17:09,361 --> 02:17:11,464
There have been a number of reports, a number of concerns.

1746
02:17:12,226 --> 02:17:15,090
I've been contacted by a number of parents relative to this very issue.

1747
02:17:15,972 --> 02:17:22,582
And I'd like to get a look at what data we're collecting up there to see if there are any trends or any type of

1748
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:25,731
circumstances going on that we need to know about.

1749
02:17:26,311 --> 02:17:34,193
Ultimately, just like most other things in this community, we're left in the dark until brave parents and brave voices come up and fill us in on what's going on.

1750
02:17:34,953 --> 02:17:38,194
And I think that it's time that we take a look at this long and hard.

1751
02:17:38,734 --> 02:17:40,954
So I've asked for the last two years.

1752
02:17:40,974 --> 02:17:48,596
I understand that this data is going to be very interesting because the last two years have been very interesting relative to the population and the public schools.

1753
02:17:49,417 --> 02:17:51,097
But I'd like to see what we have there and

1754
02:17:51,885 --> 02:17:53,647
I ask my council colleagues to support this measure.

1755
02:17:54,487 --> 02:17:54,888
Second.

1756
02:17:55,228 --> 02:17:55,528
Thank you.

1757
02:17:55,608 --> 02:18:01,133
Any further discussion from the council on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1758
02:18:01,193 --> 02:18:01,794
All those in favor?

1759
02:18:01,814 --> 02:18:02,254
Aye.

1760
02:18:02,615 --> 02:18:03,235
All those opposed?

1761
02:18:03,295 --> 02:18:03,916
Motion passes.

1762
02:18:09,160 --> 02:18:11,562
22-596 has been withdrawn by Councilor Knight.

1763
02:18:11,582 --> 02:18:19,567
22-597 offered by Councilor Knight, BSO resolved that the Metro City Council request a draft ordinance within 21 days mandating the following criteria.

1764
02:18:19,988 --> 02:18:28,653
Any employee receiving wage replacement benefits under MGL 152 shall have the right to elect to utilize earned leave time to be made whole.

1765
02:18:28,673 --> 02:18:29,434
Councilor Knight.

1766
02:18:29,774 --> 02:18:30,915
Madam President, thank you very much.

1767
02:18:31,255 --> 02:18:33,737
It's been a longstanding practice that an employee

1768
02:18:34,529 --> 02:18:45,559
for the city of Medford who's injured in the line of work and receiving workers' compensation benefits would be entitled to utilize sick vacation time or other earned leave time to make themselves whole.

1769
02:18:46,240 --> 02:18:53,466
An employee injured in the line of work would be compensated by the city, the self-insurer, at a rate of 60% of their pay.

1770
02:18:54,727 --> 02:19:00,572
So if an employee gets hurt at work and they're receiving comp benefits at 60% of their pay, they're not receiving 40% of their pay.

1771
02:19:01,804 --> 02:19:08,610
And most times that 40% goes to pay for small things that aren't important to families, like health insurance and stuff like that.

1772
02:19:09,210 --> 02:19:23,062
But recently the city administration implemented a policy after some, I believe, 70 years on the books of allowing workers in this community to utilize their sick leave when on workers' compensation.

1773
02:19:24,062 --> 02:19:26,004
The city administration said, no, you can't anymore.

1774
02:19:27,325 --> 02:19:29,547
And I'm not sure why they would make such

1775
02:19:32,093 --> 02:19:46,578
policy of why they would take such steps to hurt families and put families in a bad financial situation on top of what's going on already with the injury that a worker suffers.

1776
02:19:46,618 --> 02:19:59,343
So when looking at this, I've also seen that this allowance of the utilization of sick time for injured workers, collecting workers' compensation benefits is not applied even handedly.

1777
02:20:00,331 --> 02:20:01,551
It's applied haphazardly.

1778
02:20:02,632 --> 02:20:04,452
If this person, maybe you get it.

1779
02:20:04,472 --> 02:20:05,792
If you're that person, maybe you don't.

1780
02:20:06,032 --> 02:20:07,253
Yeah, we're not doing that anymore.

1781
02:20:07,493 --> 02:20:08,973
No, tomorrow we are, today we're not.

1782
02:20:09,853 --> 02:20:17,435
So quite frankly, if there were three people in the same department that got hurt, they might all get three different answers.

1783
02:20:18,535 --> 02:20:26,157
And I don't think that that really works in the interest of humanitarianism, equality.

1784
02:20:26,935 --> 02:20:31,917
or within the purpose of the Workers' Compensation Statute, or within the purpose of the utilization of John Sickly.

1785
02:20:32,837 --> 02:20:35,358
So with that being said, I'm asking for an ordinance to be drafted.

1786
02:20:35,698 --> 02:20:39,579
This is something that's happening, it's real, it's happening right now to workers here in the city.

1787
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:43,001
And it needs to be addressed in short order.

1788
02:20:43,561 --> 02:20:45,261
And if KP Law doesn't write it, I won't.

1789
02:20:46,042 --> 02:20:49,643
But it needs to be done, and it needs to be done soon, because we need to protect these people.

1790
02:20:51,422 --> 02:20:51,982
Thank you.

1791
02:20:52,362 --> 02:20:52,642
All right.

1792
02:20:52,722 --> 02:20:53,683
Sick time is earned time.

1793
02:20:53,923 --> 02:20:54,523
It's their time.

1794
02:20:54,643 --> 02:20:55,023
They earn it.

1795
02:20:55,423 --> 02:20:58,204
It's to be utilized when they're suffering an injury or an illness.

1796
02:20:59,604 --> 02:21:06,045
And the administration is using their discretion to say, well, you're collecting workers' compensation benefits for an injury that you suffered in the line of business.

1797
02:21:06,445 --> 02:21:07,986
We're not going to let you be made whole.

1798
02:21:08,446 --> 02:21:13,507
We're not going to let you utilize your earned time so that you can pay for your health benefits, for your wife and your children.

1799
02:21:14,733 --> 02:21:16,414
It's sick, it's sick.

1800
02:21:17,134 --> 02:21:26,276
And from what I understand, whatever your union affiliation is, has a little bit of what to do with who's going to be the one that gets approved and who doesn't.

1801
02:21:27,217 --> 02:21:27,517
All right?

1802
02:21:28,157 --> 02:21:30,138
And quite frankly, that's opening the city up.

1803
02:21:31,298 --> 02:21:33,319
That's opening the city up to a number of liabilities.

1804
02:21:34,279 --> 02:21:35,059
A number of liabilities.

1805
02:21:35,099 --> 02:21:36,580
It's workers' compensation retaliation.

1806
02:21:36,760 --> 02:21:38,500
It's discrimination against a disabled individual.

1807
02:21:39,480 --> 02:21:41,361
I know a human resource director should know this stuff.

1808
02:21:44,953 --> 02:21:46,694
That's my council college to support the resolution.

1809
02:21:48,055 --> 02:21:49,776
Okay.

1810
02:21:49,816 --> 02:21:51,437
So to the chair, to council night.

1811
02:21:51,517 --> 02:21:55,640
So just, just to be clear, I'm on the negotiating team.

1812
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:57,001
I work in a municipality.

1813
02:21:57,721 --> 02:22:00,903
So you're telling me that at first I've heard of it and it's appalling.

1814
02:22:00,964 --> 02:22:10,650
So if someone's accrued 20 years of service in their community and accrued and earned their sick time, um,

1815
02:22:13,212 --> 02:22:14,213
Because I do that myself.

1816
02:22:15,114 --> 02:22:34,029
We have a process with when you're talking about before, you know, looking at FMLA, looking at different processes to make sure you're saying that in the city right now we have, there's an avenue now that employees that have earned that sick time can't use that time accrued.

1817
02:22:34,409 --> 02:22:35,810
That's what brought to my understanding, yes.

1818
02:22:38,830 --> 02:22:47,678
That bothers me in so many ways, because when you look at accrued sick time, these are the reasons why you use that time.

1819
02:22:49,099 --> 02:22:49,619
Why you save it.

1820
02:22:49,699 --> 02:22:50,620
That's why you save it.

1821
02:22:51,141 --> 02:22:53,182
That's why you want people to work when they can.

1822
02:22:54,503 --> 02:23:05,953
And the financial implications of that, if that's what's happening, in the long run, I know that it must be pretty similar in this municipality, like our municipality,

1823
02:23:06,895 --> 02:23:12,876
When you leave and you have certain vacation days, accrued sick time, you can actually buy those days back.

1824
02:23:14,816 --> 02:23:26,458
And if you have a member in his 20th year that wants to use that time, deservedly so, that comes out of, financially, you're looking at that one way.

1825
02:23:27,479 --> 02:23:35,640
But then if you look at the end result, the 30 years, what you're going to be paying out for that employee for those years that you withheld those days,

1826
02:23:37,233 --> 02:23:41,837
There's so many negative ramifications with that process, I think it's appalling.

1827
02:23:44,019 --> 02:23:53,787
I know you brought up the piece which I think is the most important piece, the heart, the humanitarian piece, that you've accrued that time.

1828
02:23:54,007 --> 02:24:02,874
You need to find a way that if you were on workman's comp, there's a reason why that you got hurt on the job, in the city, working for our community.

1829
02:24:03,655 --> 02:24:05,917
You've accrued those days, you've earned those days,

1830
02:24:06,750 --> 02:24:08,211
And now you can't use those days.

1831
02:24:08,271 --> 02:24:10,513
I just want to make sure I'm clear that I'm really hearing that.

1832
02:24:11,114 --> 02:24:14,476
And Councilor Scott Pelli, an explanation, right?

1833
02:24:14,536 --> 02:24:21,142
So you get 60% of your wages replaced through the workers' compensation system.

1834
02:24:21,182 --> 02:24:25,586
Then they utilize their accrued sick time to make up the other 40%.

1835
02:24:25,706 --> 02:24:26,186
We all do.

1836
02:24:26,426 --> 02:24:27,287
So that they're made whole.

1837
02:24:27,848 --> 02:24:33,853
But what happens in this circumstance is because they're not allowed to utilize that other 40%, they have to take that 40% from the 60%.

1838
02:24:36,004 --> 02:24:38,526
So, because that's the only income they have, right?

1839
02:24:38,646 --> 02:24:50,613
So now you're seeing a worker who's injured in the line of duty, who's not able to utilize their sick or vacation life, who's being compensated at 60% of their pay, but has a 40% liability that they have to pay back the city to keep the health insurance going.

1840
02:24:51,314 --> 02:25:02,241
So in essence, if I got hurt on the job, I'd be getting paid 20% when I have accrued sick time in the bank that I could use to keep me whole and to keep my bills paid and to keep my family protected with health insurance.

1841
02:25:04,263 --> 02:25:05,263
Thank you for the clarification.

1842
02:25:05,283 --> 02:25:07,824
I think that's a disgusting, disgusting policy.

1843
02:25:08,424 --> 02:25:10,844
And I stand with you, and I would second that resolve.

1844
02:25:10,884 --> 02:25:12,084
That's horrible.

1845
02:25:12,304 --> 02:25:14,085
And I know it's not, you know, it's complicated.

1846
02:25:14,145 --> 02:25:19,946
It's not the sexiest thing in the world, but I just happen to understand workers' comp, because that's what they do for a living.

1847
02:25:20,546 --> 02:25:20,786
Thank you.

1848
02:25:20,806 --> 02:25:21,046
Thank you.

1849
02:25:21,266 --> 02:25:22,686
Any further discussion from the council?

1850
02:25:24,667 --> 02:25:27,727
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1851
02:25:27,907 --> 02:25:28,587
All those in favor?

1852
02:25:28,607 --> 02:25:30,608
All those opposed?

1853
02:25:30,768 --> 02:25:31,428
Motion passes.

1854
02:25:35,184 --> 02:25:37,586
22-598 offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli.

1855
02:25:37,746 --> 02:25:41,709
Be it so resolved that the Medford City Council establish a new ordinance by adopting the following.

1856
02:25:41,789 --> 02:25:45,292
Chapter 26, section three, public schools accountability.

1857
02:25:45,393 --> 02:25:55,041
Purpose, the purpose of this ordinance is to improve communication with our stakeholders and establish a vehicle to increase their participation in the development of policies and procedures governing our public schools.

1858
02:25:55,161 --> 02:25:59,445
Policy of the city, it is the policy of the city that the following measures be required by ordinance.

1859
02:26:00,338 --> 02:26:08,206
One, the Medford School Committee shall be required to conduct monthly listening sessions for the purpose of receiving feedback and gathering information related to the operation of our public schools.

1860
02:26:08,866 --> 02:26:13,191
Two, these sessions shall be televised in the same format as all other public meetings and chaired by the mayor.

1861
02:26:13,691 --> 02:26:20,077
Three, the superintendent of schools and all members of the school committee shall be required to attend unless excused by a supermajority vote of the city council.

1862
02:26:21,062 --> 02:26:23,343
Four, a superintendent designee shall be prohibited.

1863
02:26:23,463 --> 02:26:31,588
Five, these sessions shall be conducted on the first Tuesday of each month in person in accord with the following schedule, August through June, for a total of 11 annual sessions.

1864
02:26:32,189 --> 02:26:35,371
Six, if the session date falls on a holiday, it shall be heard the following week.

1865
02:26:35,511 --> 02:26:38,553
Seven, there shall be no requirement to register or apply to participate.

1866
02:26:39,073 --> 02:26:41,894
These sessions shall be an open forum limited to no more than three hours.

1867
02:26:42,094 --> 02:26:45,654
Eight, attendance at these sessions for the school committee and superintendent is mandatory.

1868
02:26:46,114 --> 02:26:52,035
Nine, to conduct such sessions shall result in the forfeiture of compensation for the remaining pay periods of the fiscal year.

1869
02:26:52,075 --> 02:26:52,595
Councilor Knight.

1870
02:26:54,256 --> 02:26:56,276
Madam President, thank you very much.

1871
02:26:58,036 --> 02:26:58,797
Everybody watched the news.

1872
02:26:58,977 --> 02:27:00,277
Metro made the news again last night, huh?

1873
02:27:00,977 --> 02:27:02,057
Metro was on TV again.

1874
02:27:02,077 --> 02:27:06,698
And once again, it was not to celebrate our community success.

1875
02:27:08,638 --> 02:27:12,861
Once again, it was not to celebrate our community success.

1876
02:27:14,362 --> 02:27:31,994
Let's think about it, the school renaming, the Diane Guarino disaster, violence at our public schools, but now a vote of no confidence by our teachers against the city administration and the school committee that passed overwhelmingly at a rate greater than 90%.

1877
02:27:32,074 --> 02:27:37,158
After listening to all the drama,

1878
02:27:38,495 --> 02:27:42,876
community outrage, the fear, and the concerns.

1879
02:27:43,756 --> 02:28:05,441
One underlying theme that I keep hearing over and over again, no matter what the crisis is, is that people have no forum to voice their concerns, to voice their opinions, and to voice their criticisms of the school committee and the school administration.

1880
02:28:07,604 --> 02:28:14,829
This council has made multiple requests for this to be addressed voluntarily, and nothing has happened, nothing has changed.

1881
02:28:15,830 --> 02:28:18,252
Individuals go up to meetings that wanna speak and they're boxed out.

1882
02:28:22,195 --> 02:28:26,237
Crisis after crisis, it's business as usual.

1883
02:28:30,300 --> 02:28:33,823
Last week, we listened to Mrs. Braley.

1884
02:28:36,003 --> 02:28:48,091
stand before this entire city, the city she grew up in, with concerns about the public schools and the safety of her daughter.

1885
02:28:49,292 --> 02:28:51,013
These are the same public schools that she attended.

1886
02:28:52,915 --> 02:28:56,497
These are the same public schools where she worked for a number of years.

1887
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:04,903
And it broke my heart to listen to her tell us that she has no place to turn.

1888
02:29:06,059 --> 02:29:15,265
and that she has to go through these lengths to publicize the situation to the extent that she has to get justice for her daughter.

1889
02:29:15,285 --> 02:29:24,031
I said it last week, and I'll say it again.

1890
02:29:24,671 --> 02:29:27,893
I think it's shameful the way that this situation is being handled.

1891
02:29:28,734 --> 02:29:32,376
And I think it's shameful the way that those other situations that I mentioned are being handled.

1892
02:29:33,337 --> 02:29:35,118
And I think it's time that we do something about it.

1893
02:29:38,138 --> 02:29:48,724
When those people come up to this podium and they talk to us and they ask us for the opportunity to voice their concerns and their criticisms, we all tell them we're gonna stand with them.

1894
02:29:49,465 --> 02:29:50,786
We all tell them we're gonna do more.

1895
02:29:52,527 --> 02:29:56,949
And then we wait till the next crisis and the next one and the next one.

1896
02:30:03,113 --> 02:30:06,055
Nicole did something last week that I thought was very smart.

1897
02:30:07,547 --> 02:30:09,869
She told us that we all have a role in this.

1898
02:30:11,089 --> 02:30:13,051
And she's absolutely right.

1899
02:30:14,432 --> 02:30:31,583
And this paper tonight is my first attempt at hoping to make this right, to address some of the inaction that this body and that the lower house, we'll call it, that the lower house has had as well.

1900
02:30:32,303 --> 02:30:34,745
Being the city council, we have the opportunity to make ordinances.

1901
02:30:35,851 --> 02:30:38,672
We have the opportunity to make ordinances that provide directives.

1902
02:30:40,693 --> 02:30:51,356
And I think that underneath and based upon the circumstances that are surrounding us over the past several months, it's incumbent upon us to act.

1903
02:30:52,997 --> 02:31:01,320
So I'm asking my colleagues to act with action, not with acting.

1904
02:31:05,250 --> 02:31:07,191
This paper is something that I think we can work on.

1905
02:31:07,712 --> 02:31:09,033
I know it's not in a perfect form.

1906
02:31:09,633 --> 02:31:10,874
I know it's not in a final form.

1907
02:31:11,054 --> 02:31:13,616
I know it's something that's going to need to be addressed and need to be discussed.

1908
02:31:14,376 --> 02:31:15,557
But it's something that has teeth.

1909
02:31:16,478 --> 02:31:17,338
It's something that has teeth.

1910
02:31:17,438 --> 02:31:18,539
It's something that has requirements.

1911
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:21,061
And it's something that shows that we care.

1912
02:31:22,041 --> 02:31:24,043
It's something that shows that we're not going to tolerate it anymore.

1913
02:31:29,326 --> 02:31:33,029
So Madam President, through you,

1914
02:31:33,806 --> 02:31:49,194
to Nicole, to Rob, to Mrs. Guarino, to those that felt they didn't have an opportunity to speak during the school renaming, to the 400 teachers that stormed City Hall yesterday that feel as though no one's listening.

1915
02:31:50,274 --> 02:31:50,874
Someone's listening.

1916
02:31:51,715 --> 02:31:52,335
Someone's listening.

1917
02:31:53,536 --> 02:31:54,116
We want to help.

1918
02:31:54,876 --> 02:31:55,417
I want to help.

1919
02:31:55,657 --> 02:31:56,417
I want to make it right.

1920
02:31:56,897 --> 02:31:58,998
I said that last week, and I'll say it again.

1921
02:31:59,639 --> 02:32:01,920
So with that being said, Madam President, I rest my case.

1922
02:32:03,098 --> 02:32:04,059
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1923
02:32:04,239 --> 02:32:06,981
Thank you, Councilor Knight for bringing that forward.

1924
02:32:07,941 --> 02:32:10,423
That speaks volumes.

1925
02:32:11,584 --> 02:32:28,175
But again, I had the privilege of speaking with Mrs. Brantley privately, and what punched me in the face was the reason why I ran for City School Committee back in 2008 when I left the city of Medford.

1926
02:32:29,136 --> 02:32:30,177
Something that's uncomfortable,

1927
02:32:31,327 --> 02:32:40,015
But I didn't say anything then, but my son was bullied to horrific, horrific levels where we talked to him every day about it today.

1928
02:32:40,315 --> 02:32:44,539
And he's a well-rounded young man that I'm proud of every single day.

1929
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:49,043
And I made that decision to run for school committee because I wanted to make a change.

1930
02:32:50,384 --> 02:32:54,307
And the key piece of that was I left the politics behind.

1931
02:32:55,348 --> 02:32:58,331
When I joined the school committee, I left politics aside.

1932
02:33:00,597 --> 02:33:02,518
And it's disgusting that this comes back around.

1933
02:33:02,799 --> 02:33:08,763
And when Mrs. Bramley talks about it, it just brings me back to the reason why I ran originally.

1934
02:33:09,363 --> 02:33:10,564
I wasn't a true politician.

1935
02:33:10,604 --> 02:33:13,306
I was a phys ed teacher and the kids loved me.

1936
02:33:14,267 --> 02:33:23,073
And that's why I was, that's why I topped the ticket because everybody loved Mr. S. And then I realized my role and how important it could be and the changes we can make.

1937
02:33:25,110 --> 02:33:26,330
And then I said, you know what?

1938
02:33:26,450 --> 02:33:32,092
I'm going to do more because I realized with that administration, I could do more on the city council.

1939
02:33:33,172 --> 02:33:35,833
And then I joined the city council and you saw some great things happening.

1940
02:33:37,273 --> 02:33:39,694
But then now it's converted the other way.

1941
02:33:43,695 --> 02:33:46,596
Everybody that I've talked to that read this and called me said, thank you.

1942
02:33:47,136 --> 02:33:54,558
This is amazing because we don't have an avenue to talk to our schools, school department or school administration or school committee.

1943
02:33:56,113 --> 02:34:00,255
And at least this gives us an opportunity that it's uncomfortable for them.

1944
02:34:00,555 --> 02:34:01,575
I know what's uncomfortable.

1945
02:34:01,755 --> 02:34:03,616
I was a school kid member making some huge changes.

1946
02:34:03,856 --> 02:34:06,577
I'm a city council that has to make huge decisions.

1947
02:34:07,398 --> 02:34:10,739
But to sit there and look the person in the eye, it's honorable.

1948
02:34:11,399 --> 02:34:12,080
It's what we do.

1949
02:34:12,140 --> 02:34:13,080
It's what we should all do.

1950
02:34:14,561 --> 02:34:18,242
And all I keep hearing over and over again is that we're not being heard.

1951
02:34:19,323 --> 02:34:20,783
So why did it get to this extreme?

1952
02:34:20,803 --> 02:34:25,025
Because I waited 24 hours and I called Mrs. Brantley.

1953
02:34:25,925 --> 02:34:29,528
And I couldn't wait for her to say, George, they called me right away.

1954
02:34:30,008 --> 02:34:31,449
I got the information that I needed.

1955
02:34:32,189 --> 02:34:33,290
My daughter feels safe.

1956
02:34:33,871 --> 02:34:35,732
Our kids, everything's moving in the right direction.

1957
02:34:36,572 --> 02:34:41,376
But no, she said, no one has reached out.

1958
02:34:45,299 --> 02:34:51,183
So in conversation with the councilor Knight, we said, how, where do we want to go here?

1959
02:34:51,203 --> 02:34:52,003
Cause it's not popular.

1960
02:34:52,263 --> 02:34:54,285
What we were asking for right now isn't popular.

1961
02:34:55,525 --> 02:35:04,092
And if the people that support my school community members were good people, but it's gonna hurt me politically, I don't care.

1962
02:35:04,112 --> 02:35:07,835
This needs to be taken care of.

1963
02:35:08,236 --> 02:35:21,587
And this ordinance, this ordinance speaks volumes to the people that work for our community, care about our community, every single day, the most important people, our teachers and our students.

1964
02:35:22,932 --> 02:35:31,478
And yesterday sat in that crowd, we stood in that crowd, Councilor Caviello and I. And I was proud, I was proud that I was supporting our teachers in this battle.

1965
02:35:33,279 --> 02:35:51,772
And it's funny, what keeps coming back is the lack of communication, dialogue, because what was said publicly in front of everybody through the Teachers Association, and then what was said in a closed meeting, an open meeting at school committee, and what was said that there was, there's a contract already, there's a ratified contract.

1966
02:35:52,851 --> 02:35:53,491
No, there isn't.

1967
02:35:54,952 --> 02:35:56,313
I was part of a negotiating team.

1968
02:35:56,373 --> 02:35:56,954
No, there isn't.

1969
02:35:59,275 --> 02:36:02,917
The negotiating team met with the city school administration, city administration.

1970
02:36:03,958 --> 02:36:08,400
They came to a plan that they can now send to the body and they vote on that.

1971
02:36:09,801 --> 02:36:11,002
Then the body decides.

1972
02:36:11,342 --> 02:36:13,904
That's what we do in this country.

1973
02:36:16,148 --> 02:36:24,454
And from what I hear, because we weren't given, the negotiating team didn't let this information out, but last night a school administrator said that the votes were close.

1974
02:36:26,476 --> 02:36:33,581
I taught for 15 years, we ratified a contract, at the end of the vote, it was always 80, 90% in favor.

1975
02:36:34,622 --> 02:36:36,724
Not by 27 votes, that's still failure.

1976
02:36:36,764 --> 02:36:38,925
Even if it won by a vote, it's still failure.

1977
02:36:39,946 --> 02:36:40,967
It's still telling you something.

1978
02:36:43,043 --> 02:36:44,483
Even tonight, what do we talk about?

1979
02:36:44,563 --> 02:36:45,764
What do we all say tonight?

1980
02:36:46,344 --> 02:36:48,705
What a disgrace of a lack of communication.

1981
02:36:50,405 --> 02:36:53,806
And we have the second strongest governing body in our community, a third.

1982
02:36:54,166 --> 02:37:06,670
Well, I don't know where we are now, but they're a forum where people need to let the information that they know or they feel has to be brought out to the public, understood.

1983
02:37:09,042 --> 02:37:11,003
And it's not to put anybody out.

1984
02:37:11,063 --> 02:37:12,945
It's not to make you feel uncomfortable.

1985
02:37:13,745 --> 02:37:15,527
It's to share the information that's vital.

1986
02:37:18,289 --> 02:37:27,015
But the process set up in that forum, it stymies that.

1987
02:37:27,135 --> 02:37:29,257
It stymies the process of open forum.

1988
02:37:29,297 --> 02:37:33,199
It stymies the process of sharing information that's important.

1989
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:36,662
And I'll tell you, when I left that meeting yesterday,

1990
02:37:38,047 --> 02:37:41,009
And teachers came up to me, great teachers, teachers we know and love.

1991
02:37:42,310 --> 02:37:50,177
And I know Councilor Beas wrote an impassionate, and they wanted me to share that they appreciated that, and they know that we're supporting the teachers.

1992
02:37:52,619 --> 02:38:04,008
But what they told me, this resolution will speak louder than any vote of a budget or a contract, because this gives them a forum.

1993
02:38:05,016 --> 02:38:14,203
that teachers and parents and kids can come to a podium, to a body that they elected and say, we need help, or we need justice, or we need support.

1994
02:38:15,444 --> 02:38:16,065
Or do you know what?

1995
02:38:16,625 --> 02:38:23,431
I know Councilor Knight hates it, or just to come up and speak because it's their forum, right?

1996
02:38:26,393 --> 02:38:28,194
So I'm gonna leave it at this.

1997
02:38:28,314 --> 02:38:34,059
I'm gonna, again, I say this because you have to hear this to the Brantley family.

1998
02:38:36,247 --> 02:38:40,350
Sometimes in horrible situations, great things come out of it.

1999
02:38:41,311 --> 02:38:54,222
And I think this is something that if it's supported by this council, that's gonna be resounding for a long time to come because we're gonna have a voice and someone's gonna have to listen.

2000
02:38:55,983 --> 02:39:00,747
And for a personal level, thank you for showing me why I took this job and why I do what I do.

2001
02:39:00,767 --> 02:39:02,449
Okay?

2002
02:39:03,460 --> 02:39:09,466
Again, councilor, I ask my council colleagues that I know it's not comfortable.

2003
02:39:09,526 --> 02:39:22,678
I know it's very uncomfortable because a lot of those people are our friends, but sometimes you have to make a decision that's bigger than yourself and bigger than a political line.

2004
02:39:22,998 --> 02:39:25,601
So I ask everybody to support this ordinance.

2005
02:39:25,621 --> 02:39:26,202
I think it's important.

2006
02:39:32,847 --> 02:39:33,767
Thank you, Madam President.

2007
02:39:34,608 --> 02:39:47,852
You know, I told, last week I told a couple hundred people about our meeting last week and how in 11 years being on this council was probably the worst night of my life.

2008
02:39:48,993 --> 02:40:00,937
Sit here as a father who had children that went to that school, as a grandfather who has children at that school, sit here and watch our parents

2009
02:40:02,530 --> 02:40:05,051
beg for help, and I couldn't help.

2010
02:40:06,592 --> 02:40:11,294
Like Councilor Scott probably said, this is the reason I ran for this job, to help people.

2011
02:40:11,714 --> 02:40:14,135
That's the job of governments, to help people.

2012
02:40:15,397 --> 02:40:21,681
And I just felt so insignificant last week.

2013
02:40:21,921 --> 02:40:25,224
I went home, I was really beside myself.

2014
02:40:25,264 --> 02:40:28,145
And I say, I just didn't know what to do.

2015
02:40:28,225 --> 02:40:35,310
And I'm glad we're finally stepping forward and doing something to help people.

2016
02:40:35,790 --> 02:40:38,152
This is our job, to help people.

2017
02:40:38,528 --> 02:40:40,029
This is their voices, this room.

2018
02:40:40,669 --> 02:40:41,930
This is where their voices get out.

2019
02:40:43,451 --> 02:40:54,237
We said earlier that people come up here and say a lot of stuff we don't like to hear, but this is their forum to be heard, and we're the group that's supposed to be able to help them.

2020
02:40:54,637 --> 02:40:57,758
And when we don't help them, we're not doing our job either.

2021
02:40:58,079 --> 02:41:04,122
So I would hope this would have some teeth and get help out to the people who need help.

2022
02:41:04,902 --> 02:41:05,122
Thank you.

2023
02:41:09,845 --> 02:41:10,606
Thank you, Madam President.

2024
02:41:13,612 --> 02:41:19,845
First thing I want to say is, and I've exchanged some private conversation is that I apologize for not speaking up last week.

2025
02:41:21,475 --> 02:41:22,275
could give a million excuse.

2026
02:41:22,335 --> 02:41:29,458
I did have the flu and we're on zoom and whatever, but I should have said something because I can't imagine how you both feel and what you've been going through.

2027
02:41:31,279 --> 02:41:32,720
Counselor Scott probably talks about his son.

2028
02:41:32,740 --> 02:41:35,801
I was at Medford high school 11 years ago.

2029
02:41:36,081 --> 02:41:37,742
My sister was there six years ago.

2030
02:41:38,162 --> 02:41:41,064
We've dealt with some issues, not what you've dealt with lesser than that.

2031
02:41:41,124 --> 02:41:42,804
And I know how much it affected our family.

2032
02:41:42,864 --> 02:41:47,186
So I just want to say that to you directly that I wish I'd said something last week.

2033
02:41:47,206 --> 02:41:48,507
And that's why I'm saying something this week.

2034
02:41:48,547 --> 02:41:50,548
And I hope that we can have more conversations.

2035
02:41:52,008 --> 02:41:56,293
so that I can do what I can to help.

2036
02:41:57,475 --> 02:42:02,961
Something that really stuck with me from what you said is that being reactive puts people at risk.

2037
02:42:03,402 --> 02:42:09,229
Being proactive means that we can get ahead of things and stop things from happening before they ever become a problem.

2038
02:42:10,454 --> 02:42:25,489
Um, something that I think, uh, you know, as part of this conversation, um, around our schools and when, you know, hear from parents, hear from you, hear from others about, uh, There's a lot of behavioral issues.

2039
02:42:25,549 --> 02:42:26,871
People are, there's a flood of issues.

2040
02:42:26,951 --> 02:42:27,932
People can't manage it.

2041
02:42:28,012 --> 02:42:31,115
It's, it's, it's so much that the resources aren't there to manage it.

2042
02:42:31,876 --> 02:42:33,878
Something that we had a conversation about, um,

2043
02:42:35,105 --> 02:42:58,297
one conversation about, I don't know, hundreds of hours of conversations about in June was the budget of our school system and the fact that two days into June, the mayor cut $2.8 million in school funding this year that the schools were expecting, that they wanted for mental health, student behavior, support, and I would guess in some elements of that, safety in the schools, right?

2044
02:42:59,338 --> 02:43:00,819
And the resources that we need for that.

2045
02:43:01,937 --> 02:43:10,224
That was one of my biggest concerns when I made the budget presentation, when we advocated and fought for funding to be restored to the schools so that schools have the resources that they need to succeed.

2046
02:43:11,385 --> 02:43:17,250
We restored some funding, I think a few hundred thousand, but not 2.8 million.

2047
02:43:17,290 --> 02:43:26,477
We didn't restore the resources and support that our schools asked for and that they expected to be able to, I think, hopefully deal with some of these issues.

2048
02:43:26,938 --> 02:43:29,099
Now, I also wanna say that I certainly think there's

2049
02:43:30,876 --> 02:43:34,258
I'm not saying it's all just a question of resources.

2050
02:43:34,298 --> 02:43:39,160
I think better decisions and better processes and better communication need to be a part of this, too.

2051
02:43:39,180 --> 02:43:44,883
Um, now I'm going to say something that I don't think everyone's going to agree with here.

2052
02:43:45,823 --> 02:43:49,905
Which is that this proposal specifically we've had a lot of conversations about.

2053
02:43:50,945 --> 02:43:52,426
What is in the school committees purview?

2054
02:43:52,486 --> 02:43:53,947
What is in the city council's purview?

2055
02:43:53,967 --> 02:43:56,128
We've had a lot of conversations about the city charter.

2056
02:43:56,987 --> 02:43:58,388
and Massachusetts General Law.

2057
02:43:59,088 --> 02:44:10,233
And we could pass this thing word for word right now, and I guarantee you that whether it's the school lawyer or the school committee itself or somebody else, they're going to come and say, this is unenforceable.

2058
02:44:10,273 --> 02:44:11,653
We're not going to follow any of this.

2059
02:44:11,693 --> 02:44:12,694
We're not going to do any of this.

2060
02:44:14,915 --> 02:44:15,735
That's what they're going to say.

2061
02:44:16,455 --> 02:44:20,877
If you look at Mass General Law, the authority over the schools, over school governance, it falls to the school committee.

2062
02:44:20,897 --> 02:44:21,958
If you look at the city charter,

2063
02:44:22,895 --> 02:44:25,037
the city council can't pass an ordinance on this.

2064
02:44:25,117 --> 02:44:29,320
Some of this I think falls into passing rules for the school committee.

2065
02:44:29,380 --> 02:44:36,465
I mean, and I can only imagine how this body would react if the school committee passed a resolution saying the city council must do this and must meet this way and must do that.

2066
02:44:38,547 --> 02:44:47,233
Well, I think we'd have to discuss the specifics of that, but I'm pretty sure this council didn't agree to it and didn't implement it.

2067
02:44:47,333 --> 02:44:49,495
And I think that's the response that we're gonna expect here.

2068
02:44:51,071 --> 02:44:57,373
So, again, on the on the larger concerns about this issue and getting resources to where they need to be.

2069
02:44:57,393 --> 02:45:17,939
I propose a B paper tonight, which would be be it resolved by the Medford City Council that Mayor Lungo Kern city staff, public schools administration, and the school committee work to send the city council a supplemental appropriation as soon as possible to restore as much of the $2.8 million in funding that was cut from the fiscal 23 budget.

2070
02:45:19,105 --> 02:45:29,970
with a specific focus on surging resources to safety and student supports to address ongoing issues regarding student behavior, mental and physical health, and the safety of everyone in our public schools.

2071
02:45:31,111 --> 02:45:44,838
And I think that that is something that is clearly within our authority, within our budgetary scope, and something that would put resources to bear immediately around the issues that we've been discussing, and not something that I think will end up getting us bogged down in a

2072
02:45:45,673 --> 02:45:54,855
whether we want to say it or not, political and legal morass that won't actually bring results and proactive action on this issue.

2073
02:45:55,275 --> 02:45:59,136
So again, I'm open to more discussion around this.

2074
02:45:59,316 --> 02:46:03,976
I agree with where this stems from and wanting to address problems.

2075
02:46:04,577 --> 02:46:07,977
But I think we know what kind of Pandora's box we're opening going down this road.

2076
02:46:08,437 --> 02:46:11,338
And I don't think it's going to give us the results that we all want to see here.

2077
02:46:11,818 --> 02:46:12,118
Thank you.

2078
02:46:16,852 --> 02:46:17,855
Thank you for being here tonight.

2079
02:46:18,939 --> 02:46:22,590
I also want to open by apologizing for not speaking up last week.

2080
02:46:24,128 --> 02:46:26,069
when you came before us and briefly shared your story.

2081
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:30,191
This case is very deeply troubling.

2082
02:46:30,791 --> 02:46:43,156
And honestly, I felt at a loss for what I could offer that in that moment would possibly help given how limited this body is and what it can do to directly impact this or any other situation in public schools.

2083
02:46:43,636 --> 02:46:52,680
I was distracted by a sense of regret that this issue even had to come so far as to be brought up in a public meeting and risk further pain and exposure for everybody involved.

2084
02:46:54,428 --> 02:46:56,229
I apologize, this is state of my mind.

2085
02:46:56,289 --> 02:46:59,830
I've had the opportunity to speak with you privately and thank you for giving me your time and your perspective.

2086
02:47:00,670 --> 02:47:13,655
In reflecting, I've remembered that even in the absence of a new good idea to lend to a problem or some idea for an instant fix, which there isn't here, simply expressing sympathy can be a good start.

2087
02:47:14,095 --> 02:47:15,556
I'm sorry that I didn't offer that last week.

2088
02:47:16,575 --> 02:47:23,599
So for all the families who listen to these meetings, for your family, for all the families who invest in our public schools, I am sorry for my silence.

2089
02:47:24,720 --> 02:47:25,701
COVID was no excuse.

2090
02:47:26,201 --> 02:47:30,263
If I wasn't well enough to respond to a resident in need, I should have already been logged off.

2091
02:47:30,624 --> 02:47:31,964
That's just something for me to take forward.

2092
02:47:33,826 --> 02:47:37,428
Like I've said, I'm deeply troubled by what your family and these students have been through.

2093
02:47:38,707 --> 02:47:44,072
I'm sad that we have to go so far in giving each student what they need to have a safe and stable experience at school.

2094
02:47:44,772 --> 02:47:46,214
Every student needs to be able to count on that.

2095
02:47:46,714 --> 02:47:49,256
We owe that to our public school students and their families.

2096
02:47:50,517 --> 02:47:54,921
Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, I appreciate the sincere attempt to create a solve for this issue.

2097
02:47:54,941 --> 02:47:57,503
It's a policy that will improve conditions in our schools.

2098
02:47:58,564 --> 02:47:59,865
Talk is cheap, we all know this.

2099
02:48:00,125 --> 02:48:03,068
Roles change hands, policy is an expression of values.

2100
02:48:04,689 --> 02:48:05,330
That being said,

2101
02:48:06,670 --> 02:48:13,234
I want to support policies that will help to effectuate direct impact that this body can enforce.

2102
02:48:17,977 --> 02:48:21,599
I don't love to share this, but I'm not comfortable supporting the main papers tonight as written.

2103
02:48:22,259 --> 02:48:23,120
I do want to share why.

2104
02:48:24,361 --> 02:48:27,823
I believe this proposed ordinance, I share similar concerns.

2105
02:48:27,863 --> 02:48:29,564
I believe it would conflict with national law.

2106
02:48:29,644 --> 02:48:30,945
I believe it would be unenforceable.

2107
02:48:32,406 --> 02:48:34,067
I believe that we need to pay

2108
02:48:34,787 --> 02:48:35,988
Deep attention to resources.

2109
02:48:36,028 --> 02:48:38,629
Hold our administration accountable to following through on resources.

2110
02:48:38,649 --> 02:48:41,010
A public forum is deeply important.

2111
02:48:41,230 --> 02:48:42,570
I don't know that we can enforce that.

2112
02:48:42,670 --> 02:48:48,753
I know that we owe our students and our teachers and our school staff more resources to create the environment that our students deserve.

2113
02:48:50,899 --> 02:48:58,102
In the interest of avoiding a conflict with mass general law, I feel unable to support this paper as written.

2114
02:48:58,122 --> 02:49:04,764
I believe that we can hold school leadership accountable to our shared goals while also maintaining checks and balances in our city government.

2115
02:49:04,784 --> 02:49:16,669
That's not to say that I don't support changes to school policy that would arm our school administration and school staff with better systems and tools to prevent school violence and create the best possible experience for our students and our public schools families.

2116
02:49:17,673 --> 02:49:19,455
I just don't believe that this is something that we can do.

2117
02:49:19,835 --> 02:49:24,079
I know that our teachers, our school staff, our school committee want what is best for our students.

2118
02:49:25,020 --> 02:49:37,372
I know that we need, and I think that most of them would agree, that policy changes and resource changes to improve the condition and the environment of our schools, ensuring the best possible environment for kids to learn and thrive in safely.

2119
02:49:38,393 --> 02:49:39,334
We have to effectuate that.

2120
02:49:41,487 --> 02:49:51,077
I think that the B paper offered by Councilor, Vice President Behrs is one piece of an overall puzzle of aligning resources with our values.

2121
02:49:51,097 --> 02:49:55,481
I'd be happy to support that tonight and continue the discussion about the main paper.

2122
02:49:56,122 --> 02:49:56,422
Thank you.

2123
02:49:56,943 --> 02:49:57,984
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

2124
02:49:59,431 --> 02:50:00,591
Thank you, President Merrill.

2125
02:50:00,951 --> 02:50:04,372
Um, I think I, I also you an apology.

2126
02:50:04,752 --> 02:50:19,336
Um, I, I listening to especially I think to Councilor Scarpelli's remarks and Councilor Collins remarks I think reminds me of a few things I think the first, the most important thing is of the ideals that we held when we

2127
02:50:20,016 --> 02:50:21,037
chose to run for office.

2128
02:50:21,257 --> 02:50:37,149
And when I made the decision to jump into all of this, I really wanted to give a voice to people like me, who I didn't feel like were being properly represented in our community.

2129
02:50:37,910 --> 02:50:40,412
And I fell short of that ideal.

2130
02:50:40,532 --> 02:50:42,213
I think that's safe to say.

2131
02:50:44,106 --> 02:50:48,951
I, I was also sick and that's just, I mean that's not, that's not a good enough reason.

2132
02:50:50,973 --> 02:51:00,544
And, but I think counselor Collins is right I should have been, you know, if that's, you know, if I was already lying in bed for a few days then you know that should have been it.

2133
02:51:04,288 --> 02:51:10,552
I will be transparent in saying that when I first heard about this, which was too late, we should have received news earlier on.

2134
02:51:11,012 --> 02:51:20,959
I did contact a few school committee members, teachers, school leaders who I thought might have a better picture of the incident and the details there.

2135
02:51:21,039 --> 02:51:29,364
And I was pretty much universally advised that I should choose my words super carefully in the interests of the children at stake.

2136
02:51:29,765 --> 02:51:31,506
I think that paranoia,

2137
02:51:33,543 --> 02:51:52,049
was, I think, you know, was affected by judgment in terms of what I should have said, and I really should have just said, expressed my sympathies, because I think Councillor Collins is right, that even that itself, I think, would have been more than saying nothing.

2138
02:51:54,590 --> 02:52:02,152
What I should have said last week, I think, but what I will say this week is, first and foremost, I think,

2139
02:52:02,548 --> 02:52:11,853
what happened to your daughter and the incidents that have occurred since are never acceptable, never, never, ever acceptable in our city, not anywhere.

2140
02:52:13,374 --> 02:52:24,921
We should recognize that there is an epidemic of school violence and that this has become a very persistent problem in the aftermath of COVID and

2141
02:52:25,626 --> 02:52:27,846
and especially with... Point of information?

2142
02:52:28,187 --> 02:52:30,887
Is the gentleman referring to in the Medford public school system or in general?

2143
02:52:31,087 --> 02:52:32,027
Well, I'll get to that.

2144
02:52:33,748 --> 02:52:42,349
So, I mean, it's been a persistent problem in the aftermath of COVID lockdowns and a general downturn in youth mental health, which this council has talked about.

2145
02:52:44,670 --> 02:52:54,892
And, you know, this isn't only happening in Medford, but we in Medford should be proactive about solving and tackling these challenges head on.

2146
02:52:55,753 --> 02:53:05,907
Um, this is a personal problem to me, because I still have a lot of siblings of my friends who attend the school system, and I just graduated not too long ago from Medford High.

2147
02:53:08,040 --> 02:53:20,009
This again, this isn't unique to Medford, but I think it's important in talking to students and teachers and school leaders about how we can prevent something like this happening.

2148
02:53:20,029 --> 02:53:31,639
I think we need to, you know, recognize that we need to stop the systemic failures that led to this in the first place, especially with the administrative problems.

2149
02:53:32,419 --> 02:53:53,633
I think we need to recognize that we need to treat this problem holistically and developmentally and focus just as much on physical well-being as well as on mental health and making sure that the problem is rooted out permanently and that we don't have students that get to that point at all.

2150
02:53:55,025 --> 02:54:08,942
But such a hard approach I think such a strong approach I think means that we'll have to take a really hard look at the systemic underfunding of our schools I think it will require us to build more accountability, build more trust.

2151
02:54:11,704 --> 02:54:16,048
I do really respect the spirit of the resolution itself.

2152
02:54:16,348 --> 02:54:35,686
I think I share my colleagues' worry that this wouldn't be actionable and that this wouldn't solve the administrative problems that we saw in your, unfortunately saw in your case, and that it would also be illegal and overstepping our authority vis-a-vis the governance of our public school system.

2153
02:54:37,521 --> 02:54:45,327
But I hope that my listening to the paper, I do hope that that's, again, one piece of the solution that's more actionable.

2154
02:54:46,508 --> 02:54:50,311
And that really focuses on building trust, trust and collaboration.

2155
02:54:52,312 --> 02:54:59,897
MHS is a safe place for most, if not many, but until it is a safe place for everyone, we have a lot of work to do.

2156
02:55:01,338 --> 02:55:13,765
And it's clear to me that school leaders, that parents, teachers, students, and members of our school committee are ready to work together to try to find something that

2157
02:55:16,051 --> 02:55:24,935
prevents the administrative problems that happened here and prevents the mental health problems and prevents the physical violence problems.

2158
02:55:26,495 --> 02:55:30,877
And my hope is that something like the deep paper will help us move forward in that direction.

2159
02:55:31,457 --> 02:55:35,139
Madam President, I must just say, if I can just interject, please.

2160
02:55:36,900 --> 02:55:37,200
I'm sorry?

2161
02:55:37,380 --> 02:55:39,160
If I can just interject for just a moment, please.

2162
02:55:39,281 --> 02:55:42,162
The issue isn't violence.

2163
02:55:43,065 --> 02:55:43,625
in the schools.

2164
02:55:44,306 --> 02:55:50,891
That's just one component of many of the crises that have occurred over the last two and a half, three years.

2165
02:55:51,232 --> 02:55:51,512
All right.

2166
02:55:52,353 --> 02:56:04,943
The issue is the body's total lack of an open forum or a vehicle to it for any individual in this community to address their elected school body or the superintendent of schools.

2167
02:56:05,944 --> 02:56:06,224
All right.

2168
02:56:06,825 --> 02:56:07,185
The point

2169
02:56:08,107 --> 02:56:09,528
I want to point to the purpose of the proposal.

2170
02:56:10,028 --> 02:56:20,615
The purpose of the proposal is to improve communication with our stakeholders and establish a vehicle to increase their participation in the development of policies and procedures governing our schools.

2171
02:56:21,356 --> 02:56:22,416
That's what the purpose of this is.

2172
02:56:23,037 --> 02:56:29,041
So when my colleague puts a B paper forward, I don't feel as though that really falls within the spirit of the paper.

2173
02:56:29,781 --> 02:56:37,086
And the reason I say that is because just a couple of minutes ago, the gentleman made an amendment to Councilor Scott Pelley's paper for KP law.

2174
02:56:37,645 --> 02:56:45,509
And he asked that our finance director, Bob Dickinson, supply us with copies of the Warren articles.

2175
02:56:46,310 --> 02:56:51,112
Now these copies of the Warren articles are something that we've been asking for now for, can anybody tell me?

2176
02:56:51,152 --> 02:56:56,915
Probably the better part of three years that we still don't receive them, three years, Warren articles are where we spend our money.

2177
02:56:57,556 --> 02:56:58,116
We don't get that.

2178
02:56:58,376 --> 02:57:02,518
We've been asking for it by way of ordinance, by way of council action multiple times and we don't get it.

2179
02:57:03,018 --> 02:57:05,920
So right now we don't even know what the financial picture of this community is.

2180
02:57:08,027 --> 02:57:17,670
This council's debated papers and entertained papers concerning a moratorium on spending until such time as the administration provides us with an accurate financial picture of what's going on in this community.

2181
02:57:18,470 --> 02:57:19,911
The administration has not done that.

2182
02:57:20,651 --> 02:57:27,373
So it will be irresponsible for this body for us to say, hey, spend more money, even though we don't know if we even have any.

2183
02:57:33,559 --> 02:57:36,400
The issue isn't about this one specific event.

2184
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:39,982
I know you guys don't want to do me a cuppa because you were silent on the call the other night.

2185
02:57:40,022 --> 02:57:43,764
And I appreciate that you get for doing that, for having the courage to come up and speak on a call like this.

2186
02:57:44,084 --> 02:57:44,484
I really do.

2187
02:57:44,504 --> 02:57:45,845
I appreciate it.

2188
02:57:46,245 --> 02:57:46,725
I really do.

2189
02:57:46,745 --> 02:57:48,866
I think you guys, it's great that you have the courage to do it now.

2190
02:57:49,406 --> 02:57:50,747
But here's the thing, all right?

2191
02:57:51,167 --> 02:57:53,968
The paper isn't about this one issue, all right?

2192
02:57:54,008 --> 02:58:01,772
The paper's about the way the body handles the public and the way the body handles the public when issues of crisis or catastrophe occur in this community.

2193
02:58:03,259 --> 02:58:07,461
All right, now, last I checked, there was no lawyer in city hall.

2194
02:58:07,961 --> 02:58:12,203
We got a lot of legal opinions flying around this room right now, but there's no lawyer in city hall last I checked.

2195
02:58:12,283 --> 02:58:15,125
We talked about that a little while ago too.

2196
02:58:15,205 --> 02:58:17,306
So maybe the paper won't pass this muster, maybe it will.

2197
02:58:17,586 --> 02:58:19,006
Why don't we send it to them and say, do something.

2198
02:58:19,947 --> 02:58:21,228
Tell us why you won't comply.

2199
02:58:21,848 --> 02:58:22,968
Why don't you wanna do this?

2200
02:58:23,048 --> 02:58:25,430
Why don't you wanna listen to the people that put you here?

2201
02:58:25,870 --> 02:58:27,130
Why don't you wanna earn your paycheck?

2202
02:58:28,131 --> 02:58:29,992
Or you can challenge it, or you can just comply.

2203
02:58:30,931 --> 02:58:32,231
If you can challenge it, you can comply.

2204
02:58:32,572 --> 02:58:40,375
Why don't you just adopt a policy that says, all we're asking for here is three hours a month, three hours a month to earn your paycheck.

2205
02:58:40,695 --> 02:58:42,195
That's not too much, I don't think, to ask.

2206
02:58:42,755 --> 02:58:44,036
I don't think that's too much to ask.

2207
02:58:45,056 --> 02:58:45,557
Send it to them.

2208
02:58:45,717 --> 02:58:47,157
Let them say, no, we're not going to do it.

2209
02:58:47,257 --> 02:58:49,258
Then they can tell us why they don't want to hear from the people.

2210
02:58:56,702 --> 02:59:00,444
Let them say to us, Oh, well, you know, yeah, whatever.

2211
02:59:00,744 --> 02:59:08,228
I don't really care that's not that important to me, I don't really want to listen to what you have to say or they could they could just clearly say, because we don't have to.

2212
02:59:09,329 --> 02:59:10,470
But then we'll know where we stand.

2213
02:59:10,490 --> 02:59:14,472
Then we'll know where was, then we'll know where we stand.

2214
02:59:14,492 --> 02:59:20,355
I read for people, not for prestige, not for any other reason.

2215
02:59:24,307 --> 02:59:25,148
Thank you, Madam President.

2216
02:59:26,168 --> 02:59:39,036
And again, I understand Councilor Villes and bringing that B paper up, but again, I've said in the past, I can't support anything when it comes to financial, this revert back had nothing to do with this issue.

2217
02:59:39,457 --> 02:59:46,781
I will not support any initiative that goes to the mayor to ask about spending more money when we don't know what the money looks like.

2218
02:59:47,122 --> 02:59:48,102
So I wouldn't support that.

2219
02:59:48,603 --> 02:59:51,785
I think the other piece is very important that as a former school committee member,

2220
02:59:52,385 --> 02:59:56,728
Yeah, this is a difficult decision to make, and this is a hard line to cross.

2221
02:59:57,429 --> 03:00:17,705
But over and over again, when you speak to the educators that you all love and respect, and they tell you that there is no forum that they can reach and talk to on the school committee, when you talk to the kids that we all talk about how we want to support, that they don't have an avenue that the parents can go to that forum and speak on an issue.

2222
03:00:18,906 --> 03:00:20,107
Or, um,

2223
03:00:20,723 --> 03:00:48,382
You know, again, the parents in situations like this, I know this situation's driving, drove this issue, but we're talking about asking a school committee that, by the way, voted to eliminate security guards, who voted to implement a suspension process because it affected an uneven balance and not looking at what's in front of you.

2224
03:00:49,211 --> 03:00:50,911
We're seeing what's happening right now.

2225
03:00:51,572 --> 03:01:01,314
I'm sure the Bramleys, or the kids that are being bullied, or the parents that can't speak, or the parents that don't have a voice, truly don't care about any systemic issue right now.

2226
03:01:01,934 --> 03:01:03,995
They wanna know to make sure that their child is safe.

2227
03:01:05,275 --> 03:01:16,898
And if this is the extreme that we need to move on, I think this is where this body can, if it against mass general law, like Councilor Knight said it, let it come out.

2228
03:01:18,253 --> 03:01:21,156
Are some of these things that we can work on to change as an ordinance?

2229
03:01:21,276 --> 03:01:21,797
Yeah, maybe.

2230
03:01:23,218 --> 03:01:34,871
But the bottom line is, teachers last evening, teachers that you support, children that you support, parents that support you, came to me there.

2231
03:01:35,587 --> 03:01:38,789
and reiterated the fact that this is an unbelievable stock.

2232
03:01:39,389 --> 03:01:48,855
This is something that we are now finally having an opportunity to hold the school committee accountable for what the citizens see as a severe concern and issue.

2233
03:01:51,017 --> 03:01:56,460
And this is just an avenue that they can just go to a forum and speak because they don't have that process.

2234
03:01:56,880 --> 03:01:59,482
And to say that they do, no, they don't.

2235
03:02:01,126 --> 03:02:05,767
There's a system in place that you can petition it, then you can come up and you can speak, and then that's it.

2236
03:02:07,227 --> 03:02:07,868
No dialogue.

2237
03:02:09,408 --> 03:02:16,710
And what we're having right now, we've gone to this point where they used it last night.

2238
03:02:19,971 --> 03:02:21,511
And it's a serious motion last night.

2239
03:02:24,572 --> 03:02:25,932
They voted zero confidence.

2240
03:02:27,690 --> 03:02:33,193
the people we trust, my former colleagues, our teachers, our children's teachers, you know them.

2241
03:02:33,913 --> 03:02:52,303
If they voted for that purpose, it should hold some weight enough that this council should move this forward to show the school committee that this process needs to be adjusted on their end.

2242
03:02:53,084 --> 03:02:57,126
So I, again, I understand that it's not comfortable

2243
03:02:58,102 --> 03:03:08,306
and I understand as a former school committee member, I'd be appalled, but as a former school committee member, I would never have let my body get in this way and do this.

2244
03:03:14,629 --> 03:03:22,732
I want us all to understand, all we're asking for is a forum where people can come up and talk to our elected officials.

2245
03:03:24,052 --> 03:03:25,773
They're telling us they can't.

2246
03:03:26,914 --> 03:03:27,674
That's that simple.

2247
03:03:29,729 --> 03:03:39,132
So a vote tonight, symbolic or not, a vote tonight is to show the school committee that we need to move this forward to the next step.

2248
03:03:39,392 --> 03:03:43,433
And if the next step says, Massachusetts General Law says we can't do it, okay.

2249
03:03:44,534 --> 03:03:54,357
This council put the most important piece forward first, and that's the teachers and the students and the line of communication.

2250
03:03:56,082 --> 03:03:56,963
Thank you, Madam President.

2251
03:03:57,183 --> 03:03:57,864
President Behrs.

2252
03:03:58,444 --> 03:03:59,765
Thank you, Madam President.

2253
03:04:01,567 --> 03:04:21,503
You know, again, I think we've had a lot of conversations and when we wanna talk about violence and resources and administrative work and making sure that our schools are safe, that's a conversation that we can have and that in our authority, that our budget authority speaks to that.

2254
03:04:22,724 --> 03:04:23,845
When we start bringing in

2255
03:04:24,992 --> 03:04:39,846
things that happened two years ago, and a whole slew of issues, and there has been an election between some of them and now, where this school committee was elected, then we're making a political point.

2256
03:04:39,866 --> 03:04:40,987
We're making a political argument.

2257
03:04:41,007 --> 03:04:46,652
We're not talking about what is within our authority that we can be proactive to address the issues of violence and safety in our schools.

2258
03:04:49,207 --> 03:04:50,488
This council has an open forum.

2259
03:04:50,648 --> 03:04:51,990
We're about to have an open forum.

2260
03:04:52,010 --> 03:04:53,651
We put it in our rules to have an open forum.

2261
03:04:53,691 --> 03:04:54,532
That's our values.

2262
03:04:54,572 --> 03:04:58,836
That's what we decided because that's within our scope and our authority.

2263
03:04:59,237 --> 03:05:00,078
So we offer that.

2264
03:05:01,199 --> 03:05:02,780
Teachers didn't vote no confidence in us.

2265
03:05:03,981 --> 03:05:08,466
And I know for a fact that that's because of what we've done and what we've said and what we've tried to do.

2266
03:05:09,387 --> 03:05:12,670
Now, if we pass an ordinance, we have the authority to negotiate the teacher's contract.

2267
03:05:14,294 --> 03:05:19,237
You know, we don't, we couldn't put that ordinance forward, we couldn't pass it and it wouldn't be enforceable.

2268
03:05:19,657 --> 03:05:25,941
And it would be leading us down a road to say, we have a solution that's gonna end up crumbling before us.

2269
03:05:27,022 --> 03:05:35,687
Now, I understand that we wanna take action and do something, but I don't wanna put forward the solutions that aren't gonna get the result.

2270
03:05:36,468 --> 03:05:37,709
That's my whole thing here.

2271
03:05:38,937 --> 03:05:40,698
That's what I think this is gonna do.

2272
03:05:40,778 --> 03:05:45,660
At the end of the day, I read this and I say, it's just not gonna, it's gonna crumble before us.

2273
03:05:46,141 --> 03:05:55,125
So we can put it forward and get into a giant argument and have the school committee sending back resolutions telling us to shut up and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2274
03:05:55,805 --> 03:05:57,326
And then in three months, where are we gonna be?

2275
03:05:57,366 --> 03:05:58,667
We're gonna have it all crumble before us.

2276
03:05:58,687 --> 03:06:00,087
We're not gonna have more accountability.

2277
03:06:00,107 --> 03:06:01,108
We're not gonna have a change.

2278
03:06:01,268 --> 03:06:06,891
And we're not gonna have had the proactive discussions on the things within our authority to try to advance concrete solutions.

2279
03:06:07,902 --> 03:06:11,623
around this issue of safety and violence, which I think we all take very seriously.

2280
03:06:12,223 --> 03:06:13,924
So that's where I'm coming from on this.

2281
03:06:14,824 --> 03:06:23,947
Now, if we want to have more discussions in committee about things that we can do and take action on that are within our authority that we think can encourage this, I'm open to that.

2282
03:06:25,507 --> 03:06:28,368
But at the end of the day, we aren't the school committee.

2283
03:06:28,388 --> 03:06:29,828
We don't set the rules of the school committee.

2284
03:06:29,848 --> 03:06:31,209
We don't set the meetings of the school committee.

2285
03:06:31,229 --> 03:06:32,969
We don't govern the public schools of the city.

2286
03:06:33,149 --> 03:06:33,829
We pay them.

2287
03:06:34,009 --> 03:06:35,630
Well, the whole city pays them.

2288
03:06:36,660 --> 03:06:47,951
It's a system in our charter of checks and balances and a system of mass general law that has very specifically said, there's a city council that is a legislative body when it comes to city matters under our charter we approve the budget.

2289
03:06:48,372 --> 03:06:56,520
We look at ordinances, and we look at zoning, and that under master while the school committee has complete and total governance over the Metro public schools.

2290
03:06:57,301 --> 03:06:57,922
That's what it says.

2291
03:06:59,303 --> 03:07:06,448
And leading people down that road otherwise on a solution that's going to crumble in front of us just isn't the approach that I want to take on it.

2292
03:07:08,030 --> 03:07:16,956
I think we all agree on some of these specific issues around administrative competence and safety and violence and resources, and that's where I want to focus.

2293
03:07:18,970 --> 03:07:33,319
You know, again, we're about to get in what I can remember Councilor Mark saying it and us having meetings in the last session, talking about the school committee talking about the City Council, us getting furious about the school committee saying something to Council now that I'm remembering I think Councilor Knight brought up.

2294
03:07:34,500 --> 03:07:39,923
You don't go into the into there you don't you don't cross that line into there because all you're going to get is trouble.

2295
03:07:40,883 --> 03:07:42,524
And that's, that's what's going to happen here.

2296
03:07:44,186 --> 03:07:44,786
Point of information.

2297
03:07:46,027 --> 03:07:48,068
With the same hold true between

2298
03:07:48,679 --> 03:07:51,702
other legislative bodies and various levels of government.

2299
03:07:52,763 --> 03:07:57,789
Hey, if this was an advisory, Councillor Knight, we asked you to hold public forums.

2300
03:07:58,610 --> 03:07:59,811
That's a different conversation.

2301
03:08:00,191 --> 03:08:08,100
This is an ordinance mandating it and taking away people's pay if they don't do it, and basically baiting them into having an argument with us about it.

2302
03:08:08,961 --> 03:08:10,062
That's my how I read it.

2303
03:08:11,221 --> 03:08:13,101
I'm sorry, but that's how I read it.

2304
03:08:13,261 --> 03:08:23,964
If it was, it was saying we believe in the principle of a public forum and we ask wholeheartedly that the school committee hold a public forum on this issue, you know, and again, if something is on the agenda, people can speak to it.

2305
03:08:24,944 --> 03:08:27,905
That's also just kind of how individual members of a body work.

2306
03:08:28,325 --> 03:08:30,966
That'd be an entirely different story, but it's not.

2307
03:08:32,666 --> 03:08:32,986
Thank you.

2308
03:08:33,126 --> 03:08:37,247
And I appreciate Councilor Villes point, but I just have a question to my, my colleague.

2309
03:08:39,733 --> 03:08:45,438
Do you feel the school committee is listening to our people?

2310
03:08:47,540 --> 03:08:48,921
That's to who?

2311
03:08:50,443 --> 03:08:59,431
Do you feel what you've seen and what we've gone through for the last few months, do you feel that the school committee is given an avenue

2312
03:09:00,795 --> 03:09:06,797
for our constituents to go and speak on concerns and issues that we think is vital to our community.

2313
03:09:07,057 --> 03:09:07,937
Anne Avenue, yes.

2314
03:09:08,918 --> 03:09:11,718
The preferred avenue, maybe not.

2315
03:09:11,738 --> 03:09:13,699
But Anne Avenue, yes.

2316
03:09:13,799 --> 03:09:24,802
So with that, I would say, I'm not asking the school committee to change any policy or procedure dealing with how to run the school.

2317
03:09:25,463 --> 03:09:26,303
I'm asking them,

2318
03:09:27,817 --> 03:09:40,525
I'm asking us to support an ordinance that brings the school committee, bring the constituents, our constituents, our parents, our teachers, a forum that they can go to and speak on concerns and issues.

2319
03:09:40,965 --> 03:09:41,366
That's all.

2320
03:09:41,846 --> 03:09:46,349
It has nothing to do with the policies that they have.

2321
03:09:47,389 --> 03:09:48,510
President Behrs, you had the floor.

2322
03:09:49,451 --> 03:09:52,152
Yeah, I mean, I think we've had the conversation.

2323
03:09:53,233 --> 03:09:56,195
We've decided how we want to run a public body.

2324
03:09:58,222 --> 03:09:59,343
We have an open forum.

2325
03:10:00,204 --> 03:10:02,386
We have a place for people to come have a conversation.

2326
03:10:03,767 --> 03:10:11,554
Obviously, sometimes we have to say, please stick to your five minutes or stick to 90 seconds because we have a big line, but people come here and we have a public forum.

2327
03:10:11,574 --> 03:10:15,177
And that's what we as a group have decided is how the city council should run.

2328
03:10:17,959 --> 03:10:20,482
Now, the school committee has decided a different approach.

2329
03:10:21,735 --> 03:10:23,576
you put something on the agenda, it takes time.

2330
03:10:24,636 --> 03:10:30,418
It's maybe not, you know, my preferred approach necessarily, but it's what they've decided to do.

2331
03:10:31,838 --> 03:10:43,382
And I think us going and saying, we want you to do this and we're going to enforce financial penalties on you to do what we say doesn't align with any understanding of the city charter and mass general law that I have.

2332
03:10:44,483 --> 03:10:45,723
And I'd like to focus on different

2333
03:10:46,419 --> 03:10:49,400
actionable solutions to try to reach the results that we're trying to achieve.

2334
03:10:49,500 --> 03:10:49,860
Thank you.

2335
03:10:50,080 --> 03:10:50,380
Thank you.

2336
03:10:50,640 --> 03:10:52,000
So any further discussion from the council?

2337
03:10:53,481 --> 03:10:53,941
Councilor Knight?

2338
03:10:54,161 --> 03:10:54,661
Move rule.

2339
03:10:54,681 --> 03:10:58,942
Before we get to that, I know we have members of the public who wish to speak.

2340
03:10:59,522 --> 03:11:00,983
Pretty much everything has been said at this point.

2341
03:11:01,583 --> 03:11:05,604
I also am of the mind that I do not believe we have the power to enforce this.

2342
03:11:06,164 --> 03:11:08,544
I don't want to make rules for a separate body.

2343
03:11:08,584 --> 03:11:09,425
They're a separate body.

2344
03:11:09,445 --> 03:11:10,305
They don't make rules for us.

2345
03:11:10,325 --> 03:11:11,125
We make rules for them.

2346
03:11:11,645 --> 03:11:17,018
They're a separate body the school committee does not report to the city council department of the city.

2347
03:11:21,203 --> 03:11:29,050
Regardless, I don't, similar to what Vice President Behrs has been saying, I don't want to present the illusion of a solution, knowing that this is unenforceable, knowing that this isn't going to happen.

2348
03:11:29,710 --> 03:11:34,515
I understand what you're saying, Councilor Knight, as far as sending it out to what other legal authorities, Steve, in the past semester.

2349
03:11:34,835 --> 03:11:40,700
I'm voted, I'm voted, I'm voted, I'm voted, I'm also the chair.

2350
03:11:41,280 --> 03:11:43,662
I'm voted, I was voted into office to make decisions.

2351
03:11:44,483 --> 03:11:46,243
I can't support this paper tonight.

2352
03:11:46,283 --> 03:11:51,665
I'm not going to punt to see what some other body says to, again, extend this and give the illusion of a solution.

2353
03:11:51,785 --> 03:11:53,005
I understand the motivation.

2354
03:11:53,725 --> 03:11:54,566
That's where I'm coming from.

2355
03:11:54,666 --> 03:11:55,506
And that's where my vote is.

2356
03:11:56,766 --> 03:11:57,446
Vice President Behrs.

2357
03:11:57,586 --> 03:12:07,989
And if I may, if there was a motion by a sponsor or a supporter of the resolution ascended to a committee to have discussions about different approaches that we could take on this that could pass legal muster, that would be a different story.

2358
03:12:09,324 --> 03:12:10,564
Who's going to give us the legal opinion?

2359
03:12:10,624 --> 03:12:11,564
The mayor's private attorney?

2360
03:12:12,225 --> 03:12:13,405
Well, that's going to come on anyway.

2361
03:12:13,425 --> 03:12:14,545
No, that's going to come on anyway.

2362
03:12:14,625 --> 03:12:16,545
I mean, all she wants to do is prevent this from coming out.

2363
03:12:16,686 --> 03:12:18,206
As you noted, you would write a resolution.

2364
03:12:18,246 --> 03:12:19,106
You'd write an ordinance.

2365
03:12:19,126 --> 03:12:22,067
We've all written ordinances to fill in the gap that they've called on.

2366
03:12:22,127 --> 03:12:25,207
And if we want to bring in someone else, that would be fine with me.

2367
03:12:27,108 --> 03:12:28,248
Any further discussion from the council?

2368
03:12:28,268 --> 03:12:30,608
Name and address for the record, please.

2369
03:12:31,749 --> 03:12:32,389
How do I turn this on?

2370
03:12:32,869 --> 03:12:33,129
It's on.

2371
03:12:34,389 --> 03:12:35,789
Oh, so Nicole Branley.

2372
03:12:36,010 --> 03:12:38,290
I need to omit my address for safety concerns.

2373
03:12:39,647 --> 03:12:42,868
I don't actually have any specific words written for tonight.

2374
03:12:42,888 --> 03:12:47,869
51 days ago was my daughter's attack.

2375
03:12:50,950 --> 03:12:53,030
It's not any easier 51 days later.

2376
03:12:55,270 --> 03:12:56,191
It's still horrifying.

2377
03:12:57,811 --> 03:13:00,992
On November 7th, I spoke at the school committee meeting.

2378
03:13:02,532 --> 03:13:04,092
We spoke about that earlier on the phone.

2379
03:13:04,752 --> 03:13:07,453
I'm wondering if you went and actually looked at the meeting.

2380
03:13:09,537 --> 03:13:11,598
not since our conversation, okay.

2381
03:13:11,818 --> 03:13:28,224
On November 29th, I believe it was brought up at the City Council meeting by you and by Member Knight and Member Caraviello about what happened to our daughter.

2382
03:13:30,225 --> 03:13:36,147
I spoke December 2nd at the City Council meeting, and here I am again today.

2383
03:13:39,170 --> 03:13:42,911
I think the city has a lot of work to do.

2384
03:13:44,531 --> 03:13:58,014
And I think it's opened my eyes in many of our citizens that there is a huge failure here.

2385
03:13:59,595 --> 03:14:03,676
And as I said before, I believe there's 14 elected officials.

2386
03:14:05,076 --> 03:14:06,216
Everybody has to do their part.

2387
03:14:06,416 --> 03:14:08,057
Every parent, every elected official,

2388
03:14:09,258 --> 03:14:12,661
Every person, what happened to my daughter was inhumane.

2389
03:14:12,681 --> 03:14:15,423
It was inhumane.

2390
03:14:16,964 --> 03:14:17,985
And it hasn't gotten better.

2391
03:14:21,108 --> 03:14:28,714
Some of the words that we've talked about here tonight that I've heard many of you say is communication, teachers, uncomfortable.

2392
03:14:29,995 --> 03:14:31,477
This is uncomfortable for me.

2393
03:14:32,798 --> 03:14:35,400
Just because I'm doing it is not easy.

2394
03:14:38,722 --> 03:15:07,260
Uncomfortable is watching your daughter walk into school every day and know that she she's sad because she got hurt and she's scared Uncomfortable is how she must have felt that day on the floor This doesn't get easier 51 days later this is something that I I said to someone earlier I will never get over that over this and all the days of the rest of my life because this is my child This is my child

2395
03:15:10,507 --> 03:15:12,848
So this is uncomfortable.

2396
03:15:14,089 --> 03:15:23,535
It might be uncomfortable for you to vote on this or make your peace, but this is uncomfortable and it's not getting any easier.

2397
03:15:23,795 --> 03:15:24,936
I need everybody's help.

2398
03:15:25,096 --> 03:15:26,417
I need everybody's support.

2399
03:15:28,058 --> 03:15:37,003
Someone also said to me, you have hundreds, if not thousands of people standing behind you, but what elected official is going to take the lead and stand in front of you?

2400
03:15:39,843 --> 03:15:41,283
Wow, I thought, wow, you're right.

2401
03:15:42,484 --> 03:15:46,004
I can lead everybody behind me, but who's gonna step up?

2402
03:15:47,085 --> 03:15:57,027
I need everybody to step up for the safety of our kids, not just for mine, not just for mine, for every child, for every child.

2403
03:15:58,507 --> 03:16:08,550
So there has been one consistent, I mean, there's been many consistent people who have supported us and one has been the teachers.

2404
03:16:09,402 --> 03:16:17,486
her teachers have been amazing, amazing, and they have validated every single one of our concerns.

2405
03:16:18,087 --> 03:16:27,472
They've listened to me, they've communicated tirelessly to make sure that she's okay and that I know she's okay every single day, that we're getting through it all together.

2406
03:16:29,953 --> 03:16:33,875
So I guess my question is after 51 days, why,

2407
03:16:37,660 --> 03:16:40,221
yesterday was the first time that I heard from you.

2408
03:16:41,261 --> 03:16:51,745
Why was today... I just mean, today it was 3.30 we were on the phone.

2409
03:16:52,185 --> 03:16:53,545
This meeting was at seven o'clock.

2410
03:16:54,265 --> 03:16:55,646
And I asked you one thing.

2411
03:16:55,666 --> 03:16:59,227
I said, could you just look at that video of what I said at the school committee meeting?

2412
03:16:59,247 --> 03:17:00,988
Because I'm not sure you know what happened.

2413
03:17:02,508 --> 03:17:05,329
And I hung up with you and three seconds later, I got a voicemail from you.

2414
03:17:07,019 --> 03:17:09,341
I haven't heard one thing from any of you.

2415
03:17:10,141 --> 03:17:16,726
And I'm not trying to point you out and say you were wrong or whatnot, but it's not right.

2416
03:17:16,746 --> 03:17:25,333
And what I need everybody to do right now is the right thing for my family, for our city, for our school.

2417
03:17:26,774 --> 03:17:28,835
We only get one shot here with our kids.

2418
03:17:28,855 --> 03:17:30,717
I only have one shot right now.

2419
03:17:32,899 --> 03:17:33,999
This is my one shot.

2420
03:17:34,420 --> 03:17:36,881
And people keep saying how strong I am or how brave I am.

2421
03:17:37,401 --> 03:17:39,001
This is really uncomfortable.

2422
03:17:39,382 --> 03:17:44,504
I've had to put myself out everywhere to protect my child.

2423
03:17:46,424 --> 03:17:51,446
She's never entered the cafeteria in 51 days since this has happened.

2424
03:17:54,308 --> 03:18:00,110
Going to parent-teacher conference the other night, we walked through the overpass that we walked through 30 years ago.

2425
03:18:00,170 --> 03:18:02,111
And I said, wow, it's still just as cold here.

2426
03:18:03,216 --> 03:18:04,217
in this overpass.

2427
03:18:06,479 --> 03:18:09,782
And we opened the doors, and there was a nurse's office.

2428
03:18:12,844 --> 03:18:16,227
And I couldn't breathe, because that's where everything happened.

2429
03:18:18,249 --> 03:18:25,175
That video of my daughter being attacked was sent to me before I even started my car to get to Medford High School.

2430
03:18:28,738 --> 03:18:29,979
Because instead of stepping in,

2431
03:18:31,607 --> 03:18:32,928
People turned on their recordings.

2432
03:18:37,713 --> 03:18:38,293
I couldn't look.

2433
03:18:39,494 --> 03:18:40,175
I knew what it was.

2434
03:18:40,995 --> 03:18:41,536
I couldn't look.

2435
03:18:43,798 --> 03:18:44,619
I've watched it once.

2436
03:18:50,124 --> 03:18:53,687
So we need to step up.

2437
03:18:54,352 --> 03:18:57,595
We need to do better, not just for me, not just for me.

2438
03:18:58,056 --> 03:18:58,876
I can lead everybody.

2439
03:18:58,916 --> 03:19:00,178
I can say a million great things.

2440
03:19:00,218 --> 03:19:00,738
That's great.

2441
03:19:01,479 --> 03:19:04,722
But if nothing changes, then what does this show?

2442
03:19:05,443 --> 03:19:09,347
What does this show the kids who have the unexpected behavior?

2443
03:19:09,747 --> 03:19:10,588
What does it show them?

2444
03:19:11,088 --> 03:19:15,793
And my God, what does it show the kids that are doing the right thing and having this done to them?

2445
03:19:16,714 --> 03:19:17,675
What does it show them?

2446
03:19:22,728 --> 03:19:23,949
Come on.

2447
03:19:24,109 --> 03:19:26,911
If you don't like this policy, then what's your proposal?

2448
03:19:27,572 --> 03:19:28,373
What's your proposal?

2449
03:19:30,875 --> 03:19:31,795
What's your proposal?

2450
03:19:34,157 --> 03:19:37,760
You can say no to this all day, but then what's your proposal?

2451
03:19:38,541 --> 03:19:39,522
Can you write a proposal?

2452
03:19:39,542 --> 03:19:41,844
Can the three of you get together and maybe make a plan?

2453
03:19:41,864 --> 03:19:44,125
Because these three got together and made a plan.

2454
03:19:44,566 --> 03:19:45,406
They wrote something.

2455
03:19:45,426 --> 03:19:48,669
It says right here, Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpell, thank you.

2456
03:19:49,069 --> 03:19:49,690
Councilor Knight.

2457
03:19:54,058 --> 03:19:54,979
What's your proposal?

2458
03:19:57,922 --> 03:19:58,362
I'm present.

2459
03:19:59,263 --> 03:20:06,750
As I noted in my presentation with the paper, I did say the paper needs work.

2460
03:20:07,151 --> 03:20:13,417
I did make a motion to move approval with the understanding that the paper probably doesn't have the support and it's going to die.

2461
03:20:16,110 --> 03:20:21,653
I would be willing to withdraw my motion to move approval and have the paper referred to committee of the whole.

2462
03:20:22,453 --> 03:20:26,855
For us to meet within the next 30 days to discuss some real legitimate.

2463
03:20:28,916 --> 03:20:32,858
Options and opportunities for us to pursue certainly, you know.

2464
03:20:33,318 --> 03:20:36,479
The councils have recent issues and concerns and a lot of them surround.

2465
03:20:38,068 --> 03:20:41,649
legal basis and whether or not we're able to take such action.

2466
03:20:42,529 --> 03:20:45,810
I certainly feel that we're in a position to do certain aspects of what we asked for.

2467
03:20:46,750 --> 03:20:53,572
Maybe forfeiting their pay isn't something that we can do, but maybe wiping it out of the budget the next year is something we can do.

2468
03:20:54,212 --> 03:20:57,553
So there's different things that we can put in place and different protocols we can put in place.

2469
03:20:58,273 --> 03:21:04,275
So I'd be happy to sit down and further discuss language or put together a small working group of members of council to do that.

2470
03:21:05,315 --> 03:21:08,697
in the interest of time, because ultimately, you know, Ms.

2471
03:21:08,717 --> 03:21:09,297
Brantley is right.

2472
03:21:09,358 --> 03:21:10,058
What's the proposal?

2473
03:21:10,078 --> 03:21:10,838
Where are we going with this?

2474
03:21:10,898 --> 03:21:13,880
You know, if we're going to vote on it, it's going to die, and then we can't bring anything back for 90 days.

2475
03:21:13,960 --> 03:21:14,880
It's a simple matter.

2476
03:21:15,461 --> 03:21:24,645
We're better off keeping it in the committee and trying to work on something and getting it out there instead of with a paper vote that's going to fail and then be parliamentarily precluded from being brought back for 90 days.

2477
03:21:25,846 --> 03:21:32,910
Madam President, if I can, I, again, the reason why it was brought forward,

2478
03:21:33,958 --> 03:21:43,369
The reason why we're here is, you know, the reason why this was something that was important is because we have that opportunity for you to talk to that microphone.

2479
03:21:44,050 --> 03:21:53,100
And I know that you would rather be doing it to the people that have to make the decisions, because like we said, we can't make a decision, but when they're not being heard,

2480
03:21:54,458 --> 03:22:07,587
When you're not being heard, like I said, two days later when we talked, no one's reached out to you yet, trying to figure out a resolution, or at least bring your daughter's mind at ease, or your family's mind at ease, you have to come to this forum.

2481
03:22:08,708 --> 03:22:13,751
So I think it's something that I don't want to see die, and I think that, like,

2482
03:22:16,352 --> 03:22:18,354
Council and I said to let it rest.

2483
03:22:19,094 --> 03:22:28,002
I would support that would go to the committee of the whole if our colleagues will indulge us and then maybe we could sit down and see what legally we can and can't do.

2484
03:22:28,122 --> 03:22:39,071
And then see if there's an option that maybe the school committee sits back and sees this and says, well, maybe we need to readjust and what our policies are.

2485
03:22:39,491 --> 03:22:41,533
And maybe we need to have our forum open.

2486
03:22:42,173 --> 03:22:45,496
So because it's got to this point, everyone, it's not, this isn't,

2487
03:22:45,964 --> 03:22:47,045
This is uncomfortable.

2488
03:22:47,085 --> 03:22:48,625
I know it is, but it's gone to this point.

2489
03:22:49,185 --> 03:22:58,130
And I know that uncomfortably, it's your position and it's your family that's paid the price, but it also opened a lot of people's eyes.

2490
03:22:58,210 --> 03:23:04,553
And like I said, personally, I'll never, I readjusted who I am as a person because of it.

2491
03:23:04,573 --> 03:23:06,593
So, and I know it's not easy.

2492
03:23:06,874 --> 03:23:09,095
I know it's not easy, but thank you, Madam President.

2493
03:23:10,335 --> 03:23:13,957
And I think just to add, and I said it to you,

2494
03:23:15,813 --> 03:23:17,895
We can't be reactive anymore.

2495
03:23:18,015 --> 03:23:19,256
Even about the paving.

2496
03:23:19,876 --> 03:23:21,778
Now we're gonna ask questions.

2497
03:23:22,439 --> 03:23:22,899
Why?

2498
03:23:23,039 --> 03:23:24,680
Why are we always so reactive?

2499
03:23:25,081 --> 03:23:26,482
Why can't we be proactive?

2500
03:23:26,782 --> 03:23:29,685
Put something in place that's proactive.

2501
03:23:30,505 --> 03:23:32,487
Don't let this happen to another family.

2502
03:23:33,328 --> 03:23:35,449
Because what if the family isn't as strong as ours?

2503
03:23:36,190 --> 03:23:37,051
What happens to them?

2504
03:23:37,611 --> 03:23:39,713
What if a child can't go home and talk to their parents?

2505
03:23:40,848 --> 03:23:45,436
I am so blessed that we have the relationship that we do with our daughter, that she was open with us.

2506
03:23:46,738 --> 03:23:48,060
I wish you that for your baby.

2507
03:23:49,218 --> 03:23:49,799
I really do.

2508
03:23:50,199 --> 03:23:52,521
I really, I wish that for every child.

2509
03:23:52,621 --> 03:24:03,530
I wish that for every parent that they had that open conversation, but I'm really worried about the people that don't know how this is supposed to work.

2510
03:24:04,170 --> 03:24:05,451
I've done a lot of research.

2511
03:24:05,571 --> 03:24:06,933
I've worked in the school system.

2512
03:24:07,533 --> 03:24:13,798
I'm versed in the lingo that's in the school system versus the lingo out of the school system.

2513
03:24:14,479 --> 03:24:16,560
I'm blessed in that way, but not everybody is.

2514
03:24:18,522 --> 03:24:20,163
We can't help what happened to my daughter.

2515
03:24:20,963 --> 03:24:22,985
I'm not sure something else is going to happen either.

2516
03:24:23,265 --> 03:24:24,826
So I need to be proactive.

2517
03:24:24,986 --> 03:24:26,226
I need you all to be proactive.

2518
03:24:26,527 --> 03:24:31,950
So if it needs to go to the committee of the whole, if there's something that I can do to help, I'll do it.

2519
03:24:32,350 --> 03:24:33,511
I'll support all of you.

2520
03:24:33,691 --> 03:24:46,218
If you support my family, the teachers, and I don't mean just contract, I mean like teachers that are on the ground that have their opinion that can't go up and speak just, hi, I'm a teacher that I wanted to say that this is,

2521
03:24:47,056 --> 03:24:53,982
you know, a problem in our school, I had to apply, you know, I felt like I needed to apply to speak at the school committee meeting.

2522
03:24:54,462 --> 03:25:09,795
I needed to send to the school committee and to the superintendent who I've been in meetings with, who I didn't feel like I had the full support of, the superintendent, read my words before anybody could say to me, sure, yeah, you can come in.

2523
03:25:12,538 --> 03:25:14,798
It's, that was a horrible feeling.

2524
03:25:14,818 --> 03:25:20,440
It was a horrible feeling that I felt like it had to be studied first and okayed.

2525
03:25:20,900 --> 03:25:22,500
I poured my heart out into that.

2526
03:25:22,540 --> 03:25:25,321
Like I poured out my heart every single time that I've spoken.

2527
03:25:25,341 --> 03:25:33,762
I'm not saying, you know, I feel like what I'm asking should not be a lot.

2528
03:25:35,342 --> 03:25:37,983
I need people to be proactive to protect our children.

2529
03:25:39,152 --> 03:25:41,933
to protect the safety of all at school every single day.

2530
03:25:42,453 --> 03:25:46,034
It should be just common sense at this point.

2531
03:25:46,675 --> 03:25:51,676
So listen to the teachers, find out what they need on the ground there.

2532
03:25:52,997 --> 03:26:04,461
Because there's a lot of things happening at the school that I'm hearing about that you, everybody in the city should know about as elected officials.

2533
03:26:04,481 --> 03:26:07,662
It shouldn't be dangerous to send your child to high school.

2534
03:26:10,053 --> 03:26:13,094
and certainly should not land them in the emergency room.

2535
03:26:14,254 --> 03:26:15,855
So I thank you for your time.

2536
03:26:16,435 --> 03:26:20,737
Like I've said, I am willing to help in any single way.

2537
03:26:20,897 --> 03:26:24,678
I was on the subcommittee meeting for the school committee earlier about bullying prevention.

2538
03:26:26,198 --> 03:26:27,839
I'll do whatever it takes.

2539
03:26:28,439 --> 03:26:28,839
Ask me.

2540
03:26:29,139 --> 03:26:31,460
I think by now the city knows I'm persistent.

2541
03:26:33,261 --> 03:26:34,661
So I will continue to be persistent.

2542
03:26:34,741 --> 03:26:35,642
I'm not going anywhere.

2543
03:26:36,402 --> 03:26:39,363
I'm going to stand up for every child, my child,

2544
03:26:40,617 --> 03:26:41,337
every single time.

2545
03:26:42,097 --> 03:26:42,497
Thank you.

2546
03:26:43,738 --> 03:26:51,780
Thank you, Councilor Carballo.

2547
03:26:52,100 --> 03:26:53,020
Thank you, Madam President.

2548
03:26:55,061 --> 03:27:00,162
Schools should be the ultimate safe space for children, and our schools are not.

2549
03:27:01,022 --> 03:27:09,424
I have a 16-year-old that goes to that high school, and I fear for her the same way Nicole fears for her daughter.

2550
03:27:10,808 --> 03:27:11,909
I'm afraid for her every day.

2551
03:27:12,969 --> 03:27:24,454
And tonight we've offered some solution, but the solution we gave is what we do, what we're offering tonight is what government does best.

2552
03:27:25,074 --> 03:27:25,915
We throw money at it.

2553
03:27:26,955 --> 03:27:29,616
Instead of addressing the problem, let's throw some money at it.

2554
03:27:30,377 --> 03:27:33,198
We've got plenty of talented people at that school

2555
03:27:34,027 --> 03:27:38,270
We should be able to address this problem, not throwing more money at it.

2556
03:27:38,290 --> 03:27:43,913
The school committee talked about $50,000 for a consultant to do what?

2557
03:27:44,894 --> 03:27:46,515
To tell them what they should be doing?

2558
03:27:46,775 --> 03:27:49,417
Those teachers up there, those administrators know what they should be doing.

2559
03:27:50,977 --> 03:27:55,998
We don't have to bring a consultant in to tell us what they need to do.

2560
03:27:56,018 --> 03:27:58,919
This is the safe space for these children.

2561
03:27:59,660 --> 03:28:07,342
Parents send their kids to school, they don't want to get a phone call saying, hearing what Mrs. Braley had to hear.

2562
03:28:08,503 --> 03:28:10,484
That's a horrific thing.

2563
03:28:11,865 --> 03:28:16,189
Let the administrators at that school do what they're trained to do.

2564
03:28:16,589 --> 03:28:17,891
They know how to handle this.

2565
03:28:18,371 --> 03:28:19,512
Not bringing consultants.

2566
03:28:19,752 --> 03:28:23,415
Let's not throw some more money at it, because that's what government does.

2567
03:28:23,596 --> 03:28:26,318
We just throw money and hope the problem goes away.

2568
03:28:28,530 --> 03:28:36,318
I'll support anything we want to do today to get this moving forward, but we have to start addressing the problems up there.

2569
03:28:36,358 --> 03:28:39,762
We have talented people, let them do their jobs up there.

2570
03:28:40,823 --> 03:28:41,064
Thank you.

2571
03:28:54,818 --> 03:29:00,526
The school department said we need $71 million this year, and the mayor sent them 68.

2572
03:29:00,686 --> 03:29:05,232
So it's not throwing money at a problem throwing good money after bad.

2573
03:29:05,873 --> 03:29:08,937
They expected millions of dollars that they didn't get.

2574
03:29:10,053 --> 03:29:14,956
because the mayor decided to cut it out of the budget for whatever reasons that she had, even though she initially had a plan to fund the whole thing.

2575
03:29:15,616 --> 03:29:17,357
So, let me just go for this.

2576
03:29:17,838 --> 03:29:22,160
So in any case, is it a point of information you're debating, it's a point of information, information.

2577
03:29:22,200 --> 03:29:26,963
So if we gave it a second, would this problem been avoided?

2578
03:29:27,604 --> 03:29:28,044
I don't know.

2579
03:29:28,164 --> 03:29:36,629
But what I'm hearing in the conversation that I had with Mrs. Brantley is that people who are tasked with dealing with this are overwhelmed and they can't handle the issue and they need resources.

2580
03:29:37,110 --> 03:29:51,834
And I think a proactive approach, and I'm not saying it's the only one, but I'm saying I had a conversation and I tried to think of something that could help, is to send resources specifically around behavior, physical safety, and violence, because that's what I'm hearing that people are overwhelmed with.

2581
03:29:51,894 --> 03:29:55,774
We're hearing stories in the schools that they don't have the resources they need.

2582
03:29:56,195 --> 03:29:59,615
So I said, hey, let's put A and B together.

2583
03:30:00,316 --> 03:30:02,016
There was money that wasn't supposed to be there.

2584
03:30:02,056 --> 03:30:06,117
We have a growing problem, and I'm hearing that the staff we're tasked with dealing with it are overwhelmed.

2585
03:30:07,117 --> 03:30:10,338
If you believe that they have what they need and they just need to do it, that's fine.

2586
03:30:10,879 --> 03:30:18,202
I'm hearing from parents and from the parent who spoke to me tonight, there's people who are overwhelmed, who are tasked with dealing with this and that maybe some more resources would help.

2587
03:30:19,297 --> 03:30:22,298
That budgetary piece, that resource piece is within our authority.

2588
03:30:22,438 --> 03:30:23,558
And I think we should ask for it.

2589
03:30:23,638 --> 03:30:24,558
That's all I'm saying.

2590
03:30:25,258 --> 03:30:30,059
I'm trying to think on multiple streams in the many ways that we can address this issue.

2591
03:30:30,559 --> 03:30:45,142
And it sounds to me like getting money to our assistant principals and guidance counselors and adjustment counselors and people who are dealing with mental health and physical health and making sure that there's enough staff to properly monitor the bathrooms and the million other things that we've heard might help.

2592
03:30:46,533 --> 03:30:47,693
and may stop the next one.

2593
03:30:47,914 --> 03:30:51,475
I can't say whether if something in the past would have stopped something that happened in the past.

2594
03:30:51,515 --> 03:30:58,417
I don't think anyone can say that, but I think we can say that resources to make sure that staff is there to address these specific issues probably would help.

2595
03:30:59,938 --> 03:31:03,059
So that's what when I had a conversation with

2596
03:31:04,309 --> 03:31:08,394
Someone who asked to be proactive, that was a proactive approach that I thought we could look at.

2597
03:31:08,414 --> 03:31:09,336
I'm going to be calm.

2598
03:31:10,697 --> 03:31:13,061
If I can't just say, because I agree, Council Bears.

2599
03:31:13,581 --> 03:31:16,365
These are initiatives that we need to focus on.

2600
03:31:17,006 --> 03:31:19,729
I think that funding these initiatives are great.

2601
03:31:20,584 --> 03:31:23,465
But what we're asking for is free.

2602
03:31:24,225 --> 03:31:28,567
We're asking us to have a forum that our constituents can meet with our school committee.

2603
03:31:28,587 --> 03:31:29,707
That's all.

2604
03:31:29,787 --> 03:31:31,487
That's the point where this word is brought up.

2605
03:31:31,567 --> 03:31:32,408
That's what the issue is.

2606
03:31:32,828 --> 03:31:34,088
I agree with you a thousand percent.

2607
03:31:34,348 --> 03:31:35,069
I won't vote on it.

2608
03:31:35,089 --> 03:31:39,690
I won't support it because of financial, my background with financial issues until we see our numbers.

2609
03:31:39,770 --> 03:31:45,552
But we also have a school committee that voted in policies

2610
03:31:46,355 --> 03:31:48,916
that hinder the situation from being resolved.

2611
03:31:49,436 --> 03:31:52,497
So again, we wouldn't know that because the parents can't speak to that point.

2612
03:31:52,537 --> 03:31:53,098
So thank you.

2613
03:31:54,638 --> 03:31:56,259
Any further discussion from the council at this time?

2614
03:32:00,040 --> 03:32:01,641
Councilor Knight, let's rise to the original motion.

2615
03:32:01,681 --> 03:32:02,501
Mr. Castagnetti.

2616
03:32:07,023 --> 03:32:07,203
Yes.

2617
03:32:13,457 --> 03:32:17,140
Oh yeah, sorry, participation on, you're speaking to this paper specifically?

2618
03:32:18,241 --> 03:32:18,441
Yes.

2619
03:32:18,781 --> 03:32:20,202
Okay, please name and address for the record.

2620
03:32:21,003 --> 03:32:22,725
Castanetti, Cushing Street.

2621
03:32:23,905 --> 03:32:32,092
I don't have any dog in this fight, but this is like worse than, this is worse than bad.

2622
03:32:32,653 --> 03:32:40,339
I mean, imagine if it was one of you people that were lying on the floor bleeding.

2623
03:32:41,452 --> 03:32:44,620
or you're a kid if you ever have a kid.

2624
03:32:46,144 --> 03:32:48,169
This is more than unacceptable.

2625
03:32:49,432 --> 03:32:50,294
I don't like bullies.

2626
03:32:54,382 --> 03:32:56,703
I guess you got to talk soft and carry a big stick.

2627
03:32:57,203 --> 03:33:01,665
In the old days, Lincoln Junior High School's Mr. Buckwell, the sheet metal worker.

2628
03:33:03,086 --> 03:33:04,947
Mr. Scott probably must remember the story.

2629
03:33:05,587 --> 03:33:13,830
And walking through front of his classroom during intermission in between classes or cigarettes, he would have a steel yardstick.

2630
03:33:15,371 --> 03:33:17,072
And we would catch it on the rear.

2631
03:33:17,092 --> 03:33:19,573
They would call a cheap lawyer today.

2632
03:33:20,473 --> 03:33:21,294
They would own the city.

2633
03:33:23,562 --> 03:33:26,885
As a president once said, talk soft and carry a big stick.

2634
03:33:27,525 --> 03:33:29,587
You can throw all the money you want, as Calvillo says.

2635
03:33:30,908 --> 03:33:38,213
But you know, if you don't take care of business, and this society wouldn't be gone.

2636
03:33:45,746 --> 03:33:48,167
Maybe somebody should fall on a sword for this.

2637
03:33:48,287 --> 03:33:58,573
I'm not talking about a peon, especially if, if, if the injured party were not respected properly, maybe set an example and teach it some good lessons.

2638
03:34:00,554 --> 03:34:04,817
Um, I could go on and on.

2639
03:34:05,588 --> 03:34:09,811
But to make it brief, if you're not getting a response, well, maybe it's true.

2640
03:34:09,851 --> 03:34:11,873
Maybe I've heard this years ago.

2641
03:34:11,893 --> 03:34:13,054
I never believed it.

2642
03:34:13,434 --> 03:34:19,319
So maybe it's true that the tail of the school committee is wagging the city's dog.

2643
03:34:20,380 --> 03:34:20,760
I don't know.

2644
03:34:21,241 --> 03:34:22,622
I never went to a school committee meeting.

2645
03:34:22,642 --> 03:34:23,623
I have no interest in it.

2646
03:34:24,023 --> 03:34:24,984
They are full houses.

2647
03:34:26,024 --> 03:34:27,285
I don't know if they're allowed to speak.

2648
03:34:28,206 --> 03:34:30,208
As a matter of fact, at what time?

2649
03:34:32,982 --> 03:34:36,923
quarter to 11, there's over 60 people on the Zoom meeting.

2650
03:34:37,463 --> 03:34:40,364
And it seems like most of them are school committee members.

2651
03:34:40,924 --> 03:34:45,465
If you're not getting responses, maybe they could tune in and plug in right now, hit the button.

2652
03:34:46,306 --> 03:34:47,326
This is not acceptable.

2653
03:34:47,646 --> 03:34:48,806
This is real bad.

2654
03:34:49,026 --> 03:34:49,687
What if it was you?

2655
03:34:52,167 --> 03:34:55,668
Get your stones together, cast a stone, rewrite it if you have to.

2656
03:34:56,668 --> 03:34:57,189
Night is bright.

2657
03:35:03,337 --> 03:35:10,180
Council Member Drew's motion, I would move to approve the B paper and send the main paper to committee of the whole.

2658
03:35:10,200 --> 03:35:19,264
Okay, so on the motion of Vice President Behrs to approve the B paper, well, so we'll take the B paper separately, it's a B paper, so.

2659
03:35:19,324 --> 03:35:19,544
Sure.

2660
03:35:19,564 --> 03:35:26,628
I want you to approve the B paper from Vice President Behrs, seconded by, second on the B paper, Councilor Collins.

2661
03:35:28,768 --> 03:35:29,709
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2662
03:35:47,678 --> 03:35:48,378

Yes.

No.

Councilor Scarpelli.

2671
03:35:57,343 --> 03:35:57,403
No.

2672
03:35:59,104 --> 03:35:59,624
Councilor Sanz.

2673
03:35:59,744 --> 03:35:59,984
Yes.

2674
03:36:00,724 --> 03:36:01,245
President Morocco.

2675
03:36:01,505 --> 03:36:01,705
Yes.

2676
03:36:01,785 --> 03:36:03,406
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

2677
03:36:03,746 --> 03:36:04,526
The motion passes.

2678
03:36:05,687 --> 03:36:14,111
On the motion from Vice President Behrs to refer the main paper to Committee of the Whole, seconded by Mr. Collins.

2679
03:36:16,088 --> 03:36:18,452
All those, do you want to roll call on this?

2680
03:36:19,013 --> 03:36:19,835
Roll call, Mr. Clerk.

2681
03:36:45,627 --> 03:36:46,387

2682
03:36:46,487 --> 03:36:46,747
Yes.

2683
03:36:47,567 --> 03:36:48,128
Councilor Kerrio.

2684
03:36:48,228 --> 03:36:48,348
Yes.

2685
03:36:49,168 --> 03:36:49,728

2686
03:36:49,848 --> 03:36:50,068
Yes.

2687

Councilor Knight.

2688
03:36:51,508 --> 03:36:51,708
Yes.

2689

Councilor Strapelli.

2690
03:36:52,949 --> 03:36:53,029
Yes.

2692
03:36:56,129 --> 03:36:56,369

16 affirmative, one in the negative.

2696
03:37:00,090 --> 03:37:00,950
The motion passes.

2697
03:37:01,290 --> 03:37:06,931
I'm going to hand the chair over to Vice President Ferris.

2698
03:37:06,971 --> 03:37:07,732
I need to step out.

2699
03:37:07,892 --> 03:37:09,092
My son needs me.

2705
03:38:05,929 --> 03:38:06,529
Please stop.

2706

03:38:38,402 --> 03:38:39,783
Thank you, Council President.

2714
03:38:39,903 --> 03:38:43,846
I know that I talked to conversations, uh, clerk.
