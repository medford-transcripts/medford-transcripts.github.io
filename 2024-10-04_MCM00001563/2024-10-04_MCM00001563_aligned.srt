1
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:06,474
Welcome everyone to the October 3rd, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

2
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:09,695
And a couple more people.

3
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:12,717
And then we'll get to our first order of business.

4
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:15,278
I'll shoot Phyllis a message.

5
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:16,639
I think she just came in.

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,919
I think she's just come in.

7
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:18,459
Oh, okay.

8
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:24,122
That's Phyllis, right?

9
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:26,363
Phyllis Fong?

10
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:28,284
I think that's Phyllis.

11
00:00:29,426 --> 00:00:34,790
All right, so the first order of business is the minutes from our last meeting.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,432
Did everyone have a chance to look at them?

13
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:38,513
Are we good?

14
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:40,235
Do we need any changes?

15
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:42,697
Second?

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,421
Second.

17
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:48,762
All in favor?

18
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:50,583
Aye.

19
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:52,665
Any opposed?

20
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:56,468
All right, so I will get those minutes posted.

21
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,130
Frances, thanks for the message.

22
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:05,674
We'll keep an eye on the chat in case you have any comments.

23
00:01:07,255 --> 00:01:07,636
Okay.

24
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:10,057
Thank you for the congratulations.

25
00:01:10,197 --> 00:01:13,500
So this is scheduled to be our final meeting.

26
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:16,322
I want to thank everybody.

27
00:01:16,903 --> 00:01:26,610
It's been long, but it's been really positive and productive, and I really can't thank you all enough.

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:33,322
I also want to thank the Collins Center, who is with us tonight, Anthony Wilson, and I believe Marilyn is also here.

29
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:42,065
So the work we have to do tonight is we just have to vote on the final draft of the

30
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,759
charter and the final report.

31
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:50,762
So I guess the first thing I want to say, let's do the charter document first.

32
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:53,043
And I just want to make an announcement.

33
00:01:54,824 --> 00:02:07,410
There was like a little clerical issue and section 919, because we had discussed putting the compensation committee in the charter, but then we voted to just recommend it as an ordinance.

34
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:14,615
just based on some of the discussions, it ended up in the draft charter, so that's being removed.

35
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:20,761
Just in case anybody noticed that, I'm just letting everybody know.

36
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:31,391
Section 919 will be removed as we voted and it was mentioned in the final report as a recommendation.

37
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:33,653
Now, I'll open the floor to see if anybody has any

38
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:37,738
to bring up about the charter document.

39
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,020
And then we'll do the final report after that.

40
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:44,661
question.

41
00:02:45,102 --> 00:03:00,268
I'd like to know that we've gone through the charter document and the resolutions and where it stands and how we go that this body approves this and to move it forward to the city council.

42
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:02,309
Okay, that's great.

43
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:05,670
I just want to hear what Eunice's comment was and then we'll do that motion.

44
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:07,051
I do also.

45
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:15,334
Okay, I have 1 comment on 1 section that I just had a question about and then just sort of a general.

46
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:32,259
You know, I'm not sure if it belongs in the charter or if it's maybe governed by state law, but my question is under section 3 dash for the removal or suspension of certain officials.

47
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:48,202
And it says at the end of the paragraph, and this is about removals obviously of department heads and city officers and so forth.

48
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:59,129
The removal shall take effect on the 30th day following the date of filing in the office of the city clerk the notice of removal by the mayor.

49
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:24,240
Does that mean then that if the mayor wants to, you know, remove an employee for X reason, and they make the notification, say today, then that person cannot be removed or doesn't have to be removed until, you know, November 3rd.

50
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:28,222
So what happens then maybe in the case of, you know,

51
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:39,549
Well, I suppose in any case, really, if you're leaving of your own accord, you're giving two weeks notice.

52
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:46,513
But if you're being told to go for whatever reason, they generally want you out the door quickly.

53
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:57,879
So does that mean then that if the mayor is seeking the dismissal of whomever, that they don't have to go for 30 days?

54
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:01,896
Seems a bit strange.

55
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:06,117
So, Anthony or Marilyn, can you answer that?

56
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,061
Sorry, just trying to unmute myself.

57
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:21,723
So, reading the section, it does say that the mayor will

58
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:32,622
submit the notice of removal to the city clerk and that the actual removal will happen within 30 days of the submission of that document.

59
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:37,063
So that is how that reads.

60
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,445
So I don't really have anything else to add to that.

61
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:44,066
That's what that section says.

62
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:48,267
So they can be gone that day if she wants them gone that day.

63
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:54,942
you know, or do they have 30 days where they can stay employed?

64
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:58,985
I don't know if I'm making myself clear.

65
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:02,388
I think it's typical of any

66
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:20,544
situation of employee with employee that, you know, if you feel as though you need to terminate that employee and it has to be done today, because that's generally the threshold that you do it on when you've made that decision, and then that's it.

67
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:24,107
You know, that day is good enough for anybody else.

68
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:35,918
Well, I guess I think, Eunice, your question is, under this provision, if the mayor dismisses a city officer or department head, do they stay in the job for 30 days?

69
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:38,880
Right, or... That's the question.

70
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,122
If she wants them gone today, are they... Can she do that?

71
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:43,763
Yeah.

72
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,207
So, Anthony and Marilyn, does this mean that the person has to stay or gets to stay on the job for another month?

73
00:06:51,922 --> 00:07:15,155
Well, there is this opportunity for the individual to reply to the statement and whether the mayor chooses to have a hearing or not, which is often available, that has to be scheduled and that takes time.

74
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:20,818
So, you've got this interim, you have this interim event

75
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:27,770
if the person wants to reply to the mayor's statement of removal.

76
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,291
You have to account for that time too.

77
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,314
Okay.

78
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,415
Ron, did you have a comment about this?

79
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:41,897
Yeah.

80
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:42,298
I think

81
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:49,846
I don't know how much detail we want to put into it, but I think there has to be case by case.

82
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:55,190
There'll be a case where someone has to leave that second, and there'll be a case where there's a process involved.

83
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:05,319
The question I was having is if we're talking about union employees, does that change the whole ballgame in terms of this article?

84
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,785
No, because unions have a grievance and removal procedure in their contracts.

85
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:21,240
And this applies to a city officer or head of a city department appointed by the mayor, right?

86
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:23,682
So I don't think it applies to anybody else.

87
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:30,946
The union contract would trump, you know, to the extent that someone are examining the union contract would trump this.

88
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,708
You'd have to follow the grievance procedures in the contract.

89
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,330
Maury?

90
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:43,549
Yeah, I'm thinking, okay, I just heard it.

91
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:51,393
I think it just comes down to that the mayor is chief executive of the city.

92
00:08:51,834 --> 00:09:07,302
And just like in any business or anything else that if the mayor has deemed or the chief executive or the owner of any business that this person can no longer be here for whatever,

93
00:09:07,862 --> 00:09:13,144
whatever the situation is that, okay, we're going to terminate your employment right now.

94
00:09:13,444 --> 00:09:19,826
If you feel as though you have the grievance to come back on us and everything else, fine, so be it.

95
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:26,629
But at this point, the mayor should be allowed to have that leniency to make that decision.

96
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,912
Excuse me, but I don't think that this is an issue.

97
00:09:36,874 --> 00:10:01,459
If the mayor decides, you know, to terminate someone for whatever reason or, you know, there's a mutual separation, I think this is more about the formal part of their job, you know, like their health benefits and, you know, like, you know, if somebody needed to be gone on the day, they can be suspended, you know what I mean?

98
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,380
And at the end of the month, they, you know, they stop being

99
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:14,931
you know, a city employee, it's basically just giving, you know, kind of a grace period, you know.

100
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:35,598
But if somebody needs to be, you know, removed from the premises, the mayor has the power to do that, you know, just that their, you know, their employment would end at the end of the month, you know, their, you know, their health insurance and, you know, whatever goes along.

101
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:37,426
with being a city employee.

102
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,608
Okay.

103
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:41,170
Anthony Wilson, did you have something to add?

104
00:10:43,265 --> 00:11:00,731
Yes, I'm just I was just going back to my notes and I don't exactly remember the conversation that the committee had, but just from my notes reflected when the committee discussed this, we went through sort of the 3 different levels of oversight of the mayor in terms of these types of terminations or removals of officers.

105
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:06,033
And some communities have it where the city council has to confirm a removal.

106
00:11:06,813 --> 00:11:10,636
Uh, some have it where the city council is basically what what this provision is was.

107
00:11:11,236 --> 00:11:14,339
That they have an opportunity to be notified of the removal and then some.

108
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:16,460
Charters don't have this language at all.

109
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:28,990
I believe when the committee discussed this, it shows this middle option is sort of a middle ground is keeping the council in the loop, but still giving the sort of not infringing on the mayor's authority.

110
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,712
That was that sort of my memory from my notes.

111
00:11:35,243 --> 00:11:38,788
That sounds like what we discussed.

112
00:11:40,771 --> 00:11:45,938
So, Eunice, do you feel like your question has been answered or is there anything?

113
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,460
I think I get it now.

114
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,541
So, thank you.

115
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:50,684
Okay, great.

116
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:51,265
Ron?

117
00:11:53,883 --> 00:12:03,050
Yeah, not on this subject, but I just want to say before we get too deep into this, I want to, you know, recognize you, Milva, for the leadership that you've shown to produce this document.

118
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,614
I'd be remiss if I didn't say that Jean's revision that she sent out today was not super helpful.

119
00:12:10,376 --> 00:12:16,040
But my question to the Collins Center and to whoever, I'd like to get an understanding of how this is being presented.

120
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:17,972
to the City Council.

121
00:12:17,992 --> 00:12:19,273
Are we just sending the document?

122
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:23,214
Are we highlighting the changes in a presentation?

123
00:12:23,714 --> 00:12:36,338
And my big question for the Collins Center, having done this before, is this going to be an all-or-nothing type of vote, or is there a way that we can break up these articles?

124
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:37,498
So if I agree with

125
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:55,888
ward representation but I don't agree with the mayor having four years do I have to say no to the whole charter or do we structure it so that we're voting on each article at a time to give us more you know there'll be pieces of a full charter that I'm not going to like and I have to just weigh that.

126
00:12:56,972 --> 00:12:58,032
So that's my question.

127
00:12:58,492 --> 00:13:01,433
Is there a way, what do most cities and towns do?

128
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,854
Is it all at once, all in?

129
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:08,235
Or is it, well, I like the mayor's four years, but I don't like Ward.

130
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:13,257
Is that going to be part of this vote for the people?

131
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:24,047
Okay, Phyllis has a question, but I'm... Ron, if I hear your question correctly... I have a question for Ron.

132
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,468
Okay, go ahead.

133
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:27,008
Didn't we already vote on all of this?

134
00:13:27,129 --> 00:13:30,070
No, I think he's using... I'm talking about the vote, Phyllis.

135
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,753
When it goes on the ballot, I go on the ballot and I see... It's the whole vote.

136
00:13:35,413 --> 00:13:45,237
I mean, it has to go through the Mayor, the City Council and the State House first, but providing when it gets to the ballot, that's your question.

137
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:45,897
Okay.

138
00:13:46,398 --> 00:13:50,579
Will people be able to vote on... I was in and out, so thank you.

139
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:58,983
Okay, so Anthony or Marilyn, when these questions get on the ballot, what's usually the structure?

140
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:06,565
I'll start Marilyn feel free to sort of jump in here with your sort of vast knowledge here.

141
00:14:07,828 --> 00:14:10,795
If memory serves, I believe that this committee was created.

142
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:13,943
pursuant to mayoral order.

143
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:34,181
So my understanding, and the administration can give you more thorough direction, is that this report from this committee will actually go to the mayor, and the mayor can review it and make whatever changes she deems necessary, if she deems any necessary.

144
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:35,422
And then it is,

145
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:45,428
For the mayor to submit this to the city council as a special legislation, if the city, when the city council considers it.

146
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:53,593
The city council can also make whatever changes to whatever portions of the proposal that it, it deems necessary.

147
00:14:54,233 --> 00:15:00,856
Again, assume that the mayor agrees with those changes and the council adopts them, then it will go to the legislature.

148
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:11,742
I don't believe, or at least my last reading of it, there's no provision in here where it says that some communities have a provision that says that the legislature has to make an up or down vote.

149
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:15,264
My reading of this doesn't, it currently doesn't have that.

150
00:15:16,704 --> 00:15:21,467
The city council or the mayor, I guess, in the internal process at the,

151
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:34,112
City level could add that provision during their reviews, but assuming it goes to the legislature as is, the legislature could say, we have concerns about this, or we have concerns about that.

152
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:41,475
They usually communicate that back to the city through the clerk's office or the law department, and then there can be modifications there.

153
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:48,318
And then if the council, the legislature adopts, then it will come back to appear on the ballot for Medford.

154
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,780
Marilyn, if I butchered any of that, please correct me.

155
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:57,897
Well, the council actually votes on the document as a whole.

156
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:03,278
They can't, it's not a menu kind of thing.

157
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:16,762
And the council vote, and if the council has made changes that the mayor doesn't like, she doesn't have veto authority, but it can't go to the legislature without the mayor's approval.

158
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:21,763
That's in the constitution.

159
00:16:22,172 --> 00:16:30,695
And when it appears on the municipal election ballot, the voter is seeing, is accepting everything that's in the document or nothing.

160
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:32,755
All or nothing vote.

161
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:33,876
Thank you.

162
00:16:35,296 --> 00:16:36,797
Ron, does that answer your question?

163
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:39,117
I just want to follow up.

164
00:16:39,177 --> 00:16:43,079
I mean, I understand that the city council and the mayor will have opportunities to amend it.

165
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:46,860
The voter doesn't have that opportunity.

166
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,341
My question is that if,

167
00:16:51,325 --> 00:17:01,108
If we want this thing to pass and somebody didn't vote for it because it had, you know, the mere four and I wanted two, but I loved everything else on there.

168
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:03,245
That's kind of counterproductive in my mind.

169
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:07,128
The other thing too is I know that the city council was working on three amendments.

170
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:14,132
So I know that as a city, we can file amendments at any point, not just a full chart.

171
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:23,098
I mean, we can, so I guess what I'm thinking is the best thing is to break it up by article so that people get to vote up or down each one.

172
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:34,931
And I, I'm just the mechanism that city council was using to get amendments through so they would be on the ballot with three separate amendments that were not a full charter so I know we can amend the.

173
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:40,477
I just, I'm just trying to get my head around somebody who says, you know, they want.

174
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:43,605
They want the mayor to have four years.

175
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:48,408
There's no way I'm voting for this, but yet I really like this, and I like this, and I like that.

176
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:54,732
So that's a no vote, even though they only didn't like 10% of what was in there.

177
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,072
So that's what my concern is.

178
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:57,593
It's such a good document.

179
00:17:58,334 --> 00:18:00,995
The city council has a chance to amend and adjust.

180
00:18:01,095 --> 00:18:02,796
The mayor has a chance to amend.

181
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:03,857
The voter doesn't.

182
00:18:04,177 --> 00:18:07,339
The voter has to take it all the way unless we give them another option.

183
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:09,120
That's the basis of my question.

184
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:10,981
Thanks, Ron.

185
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:20,442
I think, I mean, I don't know if Anthony or Marilyn wants to speak to this, but I'm not sure that we have the, that's in our power.

186
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:27,206
I mean, you know, our task was to review the charter and create a report and that's what we've done.

187
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:34,890
But Anthony or Marilyn, is there any way we can look at some of what Ron is talking about?

188
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:48,885
If I understand it correctly, you're talking about breaking up, I guess, the various articles into their own pieces of legislation to be voted on by the constituencies.

189
00:18:48,945 --> 00:18:50,525
Am I hearing that correctly?

190
00:18:51,266 --> 00:18:51,646
Yeah.

191
00:18:52,206 --> 00:19:03,411
I guess I'm trying to find a distinction, Anthony, between the amendment process of an existing charter versus the charter that we've created, which is just a series of amendments, if you break it down.

192
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:05,712
I'm just trying to give a voter the chance.

193
00:19:06,472 --> 00:19:06,732
Go ahead.

194
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,454
This document is not a series of amendments.

195
00:19:10,554 --> 00:19:11,534
It's a brand new charter.

196
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:18,418
One of the stuff that's addressed by some of, by the plan H.R.

197
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:18,899
you have now.

198
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,622
We're all in, we're all in or not.

199
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:29,145
Well, this is a yes or no on the whole thing.

200
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:32,207
And if I don't like 10% of it, I have to vote no.

201
00:19:34,722 --> 00:20:00,214
that that's the usual process yes if you okay so Mary let me ask you this follow-up question if if we wanted to only make the mayor four years the process would be we create an amendment to the existing charter yes or no vote okay yes or no vote all right so that's six years out okay got it thank you um okay um maury

202
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:05,339
We have to get back to Maury's motion and officially adopt a vote on this.

203
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:11,202
I'd like to hop in a little bit because I'm going to call upon Eunice.

204
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:12,522
Are you out there, Eunice?

205
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:16,564
She's right here, yeah.

206
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:21,627
The city council is going to review our charter commission

207
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,881
Recommendations tomorrow night or next week?

208
00:20:27,521 --> 00:20:28,882
Next Wednesday.

209
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:39,845
What they've done is the governance committee, which is chaired by Councilor Justin Sang, and there's four or five others on them.

210
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,005
I think Zach is, and I can't remember who else.

211
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:46,326
But as part of their agenda,

212
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:54,796
the City Council's agenda for this two-year term has been creating a charter.

213
00:20:55,533 --> 00:21:01,295
And so, um, they've talked about it on and off for the past, you know, eight or nine months.

214
00:21:01,895 --> 00:21:05,876
And, um, now I guess they're finally getting started on it.

215
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:20,300
So, um, they are, the governance committee, um, is meeting, um, Wednesday night, October 9th at seven o'clock, and they are going to begin discussing a timeline to craft their own charter.

216
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:26,785
and they will consider the report that we are about to submit.

217
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:27,806
Okay.

218
00:21:27,966 --> 00:21:30,748
I was a little confused of what that meant.

219
00:21:30,808 --> 00:21:31,269
I'm sorry.

220
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:34,131
Ron, I agree with what you're saying.

221
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:41,677
There's a lot of issues that you may want this and you may want that, but this isn't a line item.

222
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:48,805
referendum to make it easy to say that this is what we're recommending.

223
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:58,712
This is what we're recommending as a committee and that we've all agreed upon for the last two and a half years and got to this conclusion.

224
00:21:59,252 --> 00:21:59,412
So

225
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:02,603
You know, so be it.

226
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:09,809
If the mayor or the city council wants to kind of shred it up a little bit, that's their prerogative.

227
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:21,817
But we should also have the opportunity to stand behind our work for the last two and a half years against people that have just started, that have never been in the city in the last two years.

228
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,699
So I'm going to leave it at that.

229
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:26,083
All right, thanks, Maury.

230
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:30,104
Okay, so now- I do have a question.

231
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,245
Okay, Anthony.

232
00:22:32,545 --> 00:22:48,610
Just in kind of what we're submitting, you know, along the line, the call-in center has, you know, pretty much given their opinion on our work.

233
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:53,331
And, you know, sometimes they've cautioned us about not putting something in

234
00:22:54,135 --> 00:22:56,717
giving us an explanation.

235
00:22:57,658 --> 00:23:08,325
Is that going to be, are their recommendations and their cautions going to be submitted along with our draft charter?

236
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:16,471
I just don't want all that information to be lost for the city council.

237
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:22,247
And I guess that's my question in a nutshell.

238
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:29,254
What happens to the recommendations that the call-in center made about our work?

239
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:42,390
So what I sent out about a week ago was the final report, which so when we submit, we will submit the draft charter will be part of that final report.

240
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:48,215
So whatever was in the final report currently is what we would submit.

241
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:54,220
So if you had something that you thought we should add, I mean, did you have a chance to look at it?

242
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:55,853
Yes, I did.

243
00:23:55,873 --> 00:24:04,695
Okay, so there are a number of things that the calling center recommended that we not include in our charter.

244
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:13,376
And that's, you know, valuable information that, you know, that I think should be passed along to the city council as well.

245
00:24:13,476 --> 00:24:23,578
So, you know, they can make kind of, you know, either, you know, they can have all the information they need to kind of, you know, do whatever,

246
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:30,875
due diligence that they're going to do with the document we give them, you know?

247
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:39,241
Or are they going to, again, you know, ask the Collins Center to review what they come up with?

248
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,683
Do you know what I'm... Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

249
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:44,364
Jean, did you want to say something about this?

250
00:24:45,225 --> 00:24:52,430
Anthony, we're going to include all the memos that we received from the Collins Center as appendices in the report.

251
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:58,089
All the memos from the Collins Center will be in the report.

252
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:14,453
I think maybe, Anthony, are you talking about certain things that our committee voted to include that the Collins Center said, well, this isn't in like, for instance, the ethics commission and the financial reporting or the school committee clerk.

253
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:28,022
If you're talking about things like that, I guess I would ask Anthony or Marilyn, when committees write their final reports, is that the kind of information that they generally include?

254
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:39,396
Marilyn, do you want to do you want to go first?

255
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,698
The short answer is no.

256
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:44,721
We provided the information to the committee.

257
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:51,067
It was it was what we thought needed to be brought to the committee's attention.

258
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:55,551
And if the committee didn't follow it, it's.

259
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,234
That belongs to the committee, it doesn't.

260
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,042
it's not necessarily that it would be passed on.

261
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:07,724
Okay.

262
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:08,225
Thank you.

263
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:10,306
Okay.

264
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:11,507
Um, okay.

265
00:26:11,728 --> 00:26:15,591
So Anthony, do you, do you have anything else you want to say?

266
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:30,923
Anthony Andrea, is that, uh, I'm just, I'm, I'm just trying to understand what the motion is on the floor now to accept the entirety of the charter and

267
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:34,797
and kind of say, I agree to this whole document?

268
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:44,105
So that would be, so what I would like to do is yes, the answer to that is yes for the charter, the draft charter portion.

269
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:53,192
And then once we get that done, we'll look at the final report part and see if anybody has anything that they feel should be changed or added to that.

270
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:54,434
Okay.

271
00:26:55,074 --> 00:27:01,176
So Maury and Eunice, did you have anything to say before we go ahead with that vote?

272
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,997
No, I just want to move ahead with the motion that I put.

273
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:04,157
Okay.

274
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:05,017
Thank you.

275
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:06,497
Okay.

276
00:27:07,698 --> 00:27:07,978
Eunice?

277
00:27:08,618 --> 00:27:09,118
Yeah.

278
00:27:09,218 --> 00:27:16,180
I had one question, something that came up and sorry to bringing it up now, but something crossed my mind.

279
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,622
We talk about posting meetings and so forth.

280
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:27,245
And I know that there's a section on the mass.gov website.

281
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:30,387
Let me see if I can, I had it up here a second ago.

282
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:36,871
It shows official notice posting locations for public bodies.

283
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:45,717
So it's, you can either be a physical posting community, which is what we are, which basically, and Anthony or Marilyn can correct me,

284
00:27:46,457 --> 00:28:00,300
But from what I understand, that basically means that a meeting is officially posted if it's tacked to the bulletin board outside of the city clerk's office, and then any other way that we choose to post it.

285
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,321
Other communities, they have other ways of posting.

286
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:08,481
Some of them put things in a binder or something.

287
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:15,823
Most communities now in the 21st century post their meetings to the website, and when it's officially on the website,

288
00:28:16,885 --> 00:28:21,174
The meeting is officially posted, so I'm wondering.

289
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:40,258
you know, and you have to designate with the state, with mass.gov, if you're a, you know, physical posting community, or if you are like a website posting community, is that something that would go in the charter?

290
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:48,765
And if we were to be a website posting community, then does that mean that

291
00:28:50,768 --> 00:29:10,640
If there's a meeting posted for a certain date and time, and for whatever reason, the meeting needs to change, and I'm specifically talking about an instance that came up a couple of winters ago, a school committee meeting was due to be held on a Monday evening.

292
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:15,468
It snowed like crazy that afternoon they closed city hall at 3 o'clock.

293
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:20,032
I emailed the vice chair of the school committee and I said.

294
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:23,555
Is the school committee meeting just going to be held on zoom tonight?

295
00:29:24,376 --> 00:29:35,186
Um, you know, because obviously city hall is closing early and so forth and I was told ideally that would be great, but that, you know, we couldn't.

296
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:42,888
change that because of open meeting law regulations, because we're a physical posting city.

297
00:29:43,828 --> 00:29:48,329
And since City Hall is already closed, can't tax something on the bulletin board to make a change.

298
00:29:49,169 --> 00:30:00,031
So I'm wondering if how we designate what kind of a posting city we are, does that go in the charter?

299
00:30:00,411 --> 00:30:01,352
Long way of getting to it.

300
00:30:02,792 --> 00:30:03,032
Sorry.

301
00:30:04,268 --> 00:30:12,591
But so my, oh, so my understanding of that is that you couldn't, I think the state law that allows the posting, it provides 2 different ways.

302
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:19,574
You can do the continue with the posting to some physical bulletin board, or you can designate your website to be your meeting posting location.

303
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:22,796
The chief executive of the community has to submit.

304
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:32,383
A form would be sort of 2 form, but it's basically a notice to the state saying we are opting into posting on our electronic website.

305
00:30:32,423 --> 00:30:37,007
And here is the basically the URL and that is how that process is laid out.

306
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:39,009
Okay, so it doesn't go in the charter.

307
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:40,810
Okay.

308
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:42,872
Okay, thank you.

309
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:43,973
All right.

310
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:44,573
Thank you.

311
00:30:44,813 --> 00:30:45,094
Okay.

312
00:30:45,274 --> 00:30:46,895
Now we are going to go ahead with.

313
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:51,339
Well, his motion, which anybody want to officially 2nd that.

314
00:30:53,182 --> 00:30:56,584
that we're gonna vote on the charter document.

315
00:30:57,364 --> 00:30:57,865
I second.

316
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:11,092
Okay, so the question is, do we accept this draft charter as written to be put into our final report?

317
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:13,834
Okay, Eunice.

318
00:31:14,694 --> 00:31:15,495
Absolutely.

319
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:17,456
Ron.

320
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:20,978
Yes.

321
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:21,338
Phyllis.

322
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:22,891
Yes.

323
00:31:23,412 --> 00:31:23,772
Jean.

324
00:31:24,613 --> 00:31:24,893
Yes.

325
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:25,954
Danielle.

326
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:28,276
Yes.

327
00:31:29,897 --> 00:31:30,318
Maury.

328
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:31,258
Yes.

329
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,420
Anthony Andreottola.

330
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:34,561
No.

331
00:31:38,425 --> 00:31:39,586
And me, I'm yes.

332
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:43,069
I think that's everybody who's here.

333
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:43,569
Great.

334
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:44,250
All right.

335
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,050
Awesome.

336
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,771
You're the confetti.

337
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:47,212
Yeah.

338
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:47,853
Right.

339
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:49,194
OK.

340
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:49,874
Now we're.

341
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:56,030
Now we are going to go to the final report, which hopefully you all had a chance to read.

342
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:03,833
Thanks, Francis, for the confidence.

343
00:32:03,853 --> 00:32:06,614
I've had a chance to review it, and I hope everybody else has.

344
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,095
I'll make a motion to approve.

345
00:32:08,575 --> 00:32:12,677
Well, first, I just want to ask if anybody has any changes or additions they want to make.

346
00:32:13,237 --> 00:32:14,777
Who's that?

347
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:15,078
Eunice.

348
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,658
Not surprisingly, I do.

349
00:32:17,439 --> 00:32:18,099
Oh, Christ.

350
00:32:21,728 --> 00:32:42,623
A few small things, and then I would suggest, and I can put the text that I've created in the draft, but I suggest writing, including a section, and this all goes into the community engagement summary about public meetings.

351
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:46,826
What page is that on, Eunice?

352
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,687
Do you want me to share my screen?

353
00:32:50,542 --> 00:32:51,383
That'd be great.

354
00:32:51,743 --> 00:32:56,229
And meanwhile, let me put the text that I have in.

355
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:58,852
All right, you should be able to share, Jane.

356
00:32:58,872 --> 00:33:00,935
OK, thanks, Jane.

357
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,331
I'm just trying to pull it up.

358
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:20,591
Sorry, it's OK.

359
00:33:21,091 --> 00:33:46,043
Yeah, and I'm trying to find a. See.

360
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,240
Okay.

361
00:34:01,683 --> 00:34:03,904
So on the community engagement?

362
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:05,185
Yeah.

363
00:34:08,468 --> 00:34:10,469
We have this on public hearings here.

364
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:21,697
No, this is a section I suggest on public meetings and I'm going to pop the text into.

365
00:34:21,717 --> 00:34:26,621
Oh, I hate working with my laptop.

366
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:42,442
Back to zoom how's what are public meeting separate from public hearings public meetings are like, basically what we're doing now.

367
00:34:42,462 --> 00:34:45,945
Okay, I see.

368
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,026
Let me see if I can.

369
00:34:48,406 --> 00:34:51,770
So basically our meetings and subcommittee meetings, right?

370
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,175
So I put in and the reason I suggest this is because.

371
00:34:58,097 --> 00:35:01,741
We've all heard on any particular topics that comes up.

372
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:12,325
you know, at the city council or the school committee or whatever, and people find out about it and they feel like, you know, that was done under the dark of night.

373
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:17,029
Nobody ever told me about that or how come we didn't know about this.

374
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:24,635
And this is, you know, um, my suggestion of, um, putting something in there.

375
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:29,459
And I went and I counted up how many meetings we actually held.

376
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,246
And how many of them were our regular Thursday evening meetings versus subcommittee meetings?

377
00:35:37,207 --> 00:35:38,108
And the fact that.

378
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:43,133
You know, all of them are on zoom all of them on the city calendar.

379
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:45,955
Basically, we did this with full transparency.

380
00:35:47,923 --> 00:35:56,969
And, you know, I think it will say to people, you know, you had plenty of opportunity to participate in this process, 58 meetings.

381
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:06,115
Plenty of opportunity and and that's something that I would like to see and I suggest that include the focus groups units.

382
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:10,236
Uh, no, that's separate.

383
00:36:10,296 --> 00:36:11,537
No, that's that.

384
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:12,358
Yeah.

385
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,439
That's up the ice cream.

386
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:15,080
So all that stuff went into different.

387
00:36:15,261 --> 00:36:16,001
These are.

388
00:36:16,682 --> 00:36:22,607
You know, Thursday meetings, we had some extra Thursday meetings, you know, where we doubled up a few months.

389
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:27,491
And, yeah, all of the subcommittee meetings that we had.

390
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:34,016
You know, would representation, the preamble group, we really have 30 subcommittee meetings.

391
00:36:34,457 --> 00:36:36,198
We associate a total.

392
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:38,339
So, I guess we did.

393
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:39,741
So, when you.

394
00:36:41,962 --> 00:36:46,909
Yeah, you're suggesting including, even though those were just our meetings, they were all open to the public.

395
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:56,162
So you're suggesting adding these to the public engagement section, making the point that this was part of the public outreach of the committee.

396
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:57,043
Right.

397
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:01,105
I mean, the fact that all our meetings were open to the public and we have the public attending.

398
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:01,765
Right.

399
00:37:01,905 --> 00:37:23,876
And if, you know, maybe somebody was interested in the elections process, but not interested in the school committee, you know, they could have logged on or watched on TV or watch the instant replay or whatever of whatever topic, you know, of interest, um, as well as our, you know, once a month, Thursday meetings where we, you know,

400
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:29,578
Took votes and things like that, so it's part of to be the.

401
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:35,461
Transparency and heading off that, you know, we did all of this open and above board.

402
00:37:36,202 --> 00:37:37,643
People had a chance to participate.

403
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:38,403
They just didn't.

404
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:43,145
Okay, so you want to basically.

405
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:46,546
suggest that we add this to the charter?

406
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,307
Does anybody have any thoughts about this?

407
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:51,348
Does anybody have any?

408
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:53,048
I make a motion to do so.

409
00:37:53,088 --> 00:37:53,448
Okay.

410
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:55,669
Does anybody want to have any?

411
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:58,289
Yeah, I'd like to say something.

412
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:11,192
If you would add that, it makes the appearance that there was a lot of community participation, that they had all these meetings, when in reality, they were sparsely

413
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:13,918
or not attended at all.

414
00:38:13,938 --> 00:38:18,181
I don't think it, it's not being transparent.

415
00:38:18,201 --> 00:38:28,028
It's actually misrepresenting, you know, that yeah, that they were open to the public, but you're going to put that they were open to the public, but the public didn't come.

416
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:39,397
I mean, it, it, it kind of the message is that, you know, this was like a, a community, you know, a community driven,

417
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:50,323
process, and it was, but it wasn't, you know, no one took advantage of it, or very few people did.

418
00:38:51,584 --> 00:38:58,534
Okay, I didn't see who raised their hand first, so I'm just gonna go to the first person on my screen, Ron.

419
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:03,454
Yeah, with all due respect, I couldn't disagree with Anthony more.

420
00:39:04,054 --> 00:39:07,777
Of course you don't disagree.

421
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:09,057
But it's the truth.

422
00:39:09,718 --> 00:39:12,099
Okay, go ahead, Ron.

423
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,083
The fact is that this committee made available everything that we do.

424
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:21,349
Whether people didn't take advantage of it is not on us.

425
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:23,990
It's on the people who chose not to.

426
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:31,272
And we have no measure for how many people went on Zoom and looked up recorded issues as well.

427
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:35,993
So I think putting negative in here would just be the wrong thing to do.

428
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:42,295
We gave opportunity to make this as public as possible, and I totally disagree with what was just said.

429
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,816
I'd like to respond, please.

430
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:45,696
Yeah, go ahead, Ian.

431
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,177
I do have a right to respond.

432
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:49,448
That is not what I said, Ron.

433
00:39:49,828 --> 00:39:51,469
Please don't misinterpret my words.

434
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:54,150
My words were not to include a negative.

435
00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:04,995
I'm saying that not to include a message that this was a large community participatory events because they weren't.

436
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:10,377
And it would be misleading to communicate that in our report.

437
00:40:11,912 --> 00:40:14,496
We don't want to misrepresent what we did.

438
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:20,384
We did it openly and people chose not to participate in large numbers.

439
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,968
Does that need to be in our report?

440
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,712
No, but we shouldn't go

441
00:40:26,598 --> 00:40:39,026
put in our report that we had this huge, you know, 50 some odd meetings that were open to the public to misrepresent what actually occurred.

442
00:40:39,386 --> 00:40:49,533
What occurred was that work did happen, it was available for people, and very few community members participated.

443
00:40:50,185 --> 00:41:19,741
okay that's the truth that's the reality that's not being that's not being negative okay can phyllis can you speak phyllis and then i'm going to go to maury and then danielle go ahead phyllis uh anthony i think you're misunderstanding this this is very kindly i would like you to listen okay so i'm going to say i think this is a good statement i don't think it's negative in any way shape or form this is factual these are the meetings that we held

444
00:41:20,442 --> 00:41:21,583
We invited people.

445
00:41:21,683 --> 00:41:23,524
Whether they came or not is not a point.

446
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:29,487
I think this tells, if anyone picks this up and read it, they could say, oh, they did a lot of work.

447
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:30,007
Good.

448
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:34,609
It wasn't just something that was done in, someone said, in the dark of the night or something like this.

449
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:42,553
I think it's important for people to know how seriously we took this and that we spent the time and we put in the time to do this.

450
00:41:43,094 --> 00:41:49,117
I see it in no way as being in any way, shape, or form negative in any sense of the manner.

451
00:41:50,218 --> 00:42:02,607
If people are going to put words in my mouth and say things that are inaccurate, I have the responsibility to respond.

452
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:06,730
Just as we did, excuse me, I'd like to respond.

453
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,472
Just for a minute, Anthony, go ahead.

454
00:42:10,172 --> 00:42:10,472
Okay.

455
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:16,757
In the fact of the last thing that we voted on, the ethics, right?

456
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,709
We didn't communicate with the community.

457
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:29,094
In the beginning of this process, we engaged with community members, politicians, anybody that would talk to us.

458
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:36,718
We did a lot of outreach and talked to a lot of people about things before we voted, before we formulated things.

459
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:49,082
But as the time went on, we held meetings, they weren't attended by people, we didn't get feedback, we didn't seek feedback from community members or our government officials.

460
00:42:49,682 --> 00:43:06,828
So to present ourselves is that we did this and just, you know what, just we're going to, you're going to vote and you're going to put it in and go right ahead.

461
00:43:07,726 --> 00:43:08,347
I'm all done.

462
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:11,189
Okay, thanks for that, Anthony.

463
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:15,031
Danielle, I think Maury was next, and then Danielle.

464
00:43:16,252 --> 00:43:22,916
Anthony, this isn't an attack on you, but let's just talk about this for a second.

465
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:24,177
Let's not even talk about me.

466
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:24,577
Okay.

467
00:43:24,597 --> 00:43:25,918
Come on, come on.

468
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:28,500
We've done this for how long?

469
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:36,005
You and I sat there, we talked about how many committee individual meetings- Maury, this is not about me.

470
00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:37,906
I didn't.

471
00:43:37,927 --> 00:43:41,871
Yeah, let's just focus on the proposal.

472
00:43:42,172 --> 00:43:49,601
I'm not saying it is, but what we have to hear is we did everything that's out there.

473
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:50,402
We did it.

474
00:43:50,882 --> 00:43:54,287
Whether people got involved in it or whether they didn't,

475
00:43:54,907 --> 00:43:56,148
That's their prerogative.

476
00:43:56,488 --> 00:43:59,229
It's not what we were charged to do.

477
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:05,070
And what we were charged to do, we've done it over and above, as far as I'm concerned.

478
00:44:05,631 --> 00:44:11,273
And Anthony, you know me as well as anybody else does.

479
00:44:12,353 --> 00:44:13,393
We've done a good job.

480
00:44:13,593 --> 00:44:14,694
You've done a great job.

481
00:44:14,774 --> 00:44:16,994
And everybody in this committee have done a good job.

482
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:24,402
How much can you take it that people don't want to get involved in it?

483
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:26,184
That's not our problem.

484
00:44:27,545 --> 00:44:28,807
OK, thanks, Maury.

485
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:30,349
I second the motion.

486
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:33,272
I just want to let Danielle make her comment.

487
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,723
Yeah, I do appreciate these comments, because I mean, I hear what you're saying.

488
00:44:43,863 --> 00:44:56,029
It sounds like actually you guys are kind of saying the same thing, where we presented what we could control, which was that we made as much effort to engage the public as we could.

489
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:59,751
And I think it's important to have it in here, because

490
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:08,337
not only to show this is what we did, but also for the future, when people do this again, they know how much to engage the community or how many attempts to engage the community.

491
00:45:08,697 --> 00:45:20,927
So that when people say about this, about our work, we didn't know this was happening, we couldn't do this, both they can see that what we are, the attempts that we made, and they can see when this happens again, I'll have these other opportunities to participate.

492
00:45:21,567 --> 00:45:22,468
That's a good point.

493
00:45:23,348 --> 00:45:29,313
Just a presentation of facts, like these are the things we did, this is what we could control, and we did what we could control.

494
00:45:29,987 --> 00:45:31,731
That's a, that's a good point.

495
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:32,232
Okay.

496
00:45:32,352 --> 00:45:33,174
I do want to vote on it.

497
00:45:35,136 --> 00:45:37,997
But can I put my editor hat on for a minute, Eunice?

498
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:38,857
Are you okay with that?

499
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:39,797
Sure.

500
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,658
I mean, this was a draft.

501
00:45:41,718 --> 00:45:44,599
I mean, you can, you know, tweak it as needed.

502
00:45:44,959 --> 00:46:00,363
I'm just in the streamlined mindset, and I would like to go from various components of a charter to we held 30 subcommittee meetings, just because that other information is in other parts of the

503
00:46:01,643 --> 00:46:10,252
Well, the Collins Center is in other parts of the final report, and I don't necessarily think we need to say that they were the first Thursday of the month.

504
00:46:10,652 --> 00:46:13,254
That's just, and then it just tightens it up.

505
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:16,538
I'm probably okay with what you're saying, but I just want to be clear.

506
00:46:16,558 --> 00:46:17,118
Yeah.

507
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,222
So, well, Jean just did it, so.

508
00:46:21,422 --> 00:46:21,623
Okay.

509
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:33,540
So during the span of 22 months, we have 58, 28, 30 subcommittee meeting to do deeper dives.

510
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:36,742
It just tightens it up a little bit.

511
00:46:37,483 --> 00:46:37,763
Okay.

512
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:38,584
Yeah, I'm good.

513
00:46:39,384 --> 00:46:39,765
Okay.

514
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:47,931
So we're going to vote on whether to add this to this community engagement section of the final report.

515
00:46:48,852 --> 00:46:49,092
Okay.

516
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:52,282
Eunice?

517
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:54,723
Yes.

518
00:46:55,703 --> 00:46:58,845
Well, this is where I can't see everybody, so I'm going to try to remember everybody's name.

519
00:46:59,805 --> 00:47:00,145
Phyllis?

520
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:00,865
Yes.

521
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:02,306
Danielle?

522
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:03,326
Yes.

523
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:04,147
Ron?

524
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:05,707
Yes.

525
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:06,708
Maury?

526
00:47:07,248 --> 00:47:07,588
Yes.

527
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:09,209
Anthony Andreadola?

528
00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:10,049
Yes.

529
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:13,570
Jean?

530
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:14,671
Yes.

531
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,471
Did I get Phyllis?

532
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:17,372
Yes.

533
00:47:19,032 --> 00:47:19,792
You did.

534
00:47:20,353 --> 00:47:21,113
You got it already.

535
00:47:21,984 --> 00:47:25,329
It's just me then.

536
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:25,910
All right.

537
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:28,568
I got Danielle, right?

538
00:47:30,789 --> 00:47:31,649
There's eight of us here.

539
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:31,949
Yeah.

540
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:32,929
Okay, great.

541
00:47:33,209 --> 00:47:33,890
Thank you, Eunice.

542
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:34,570
We will add that.

543
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:42,012
Any other suggestions for changes or additions or any proposals?

544
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:43,752
I move the motion.

545
00:47:44,832 --> 00:47:46,713
Okay, let's make sure.

546
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:48,553
Eunice, do you have your hand raised again?

547
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:51,154
Yeah, I just have two small ones.

548
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:55,355
Jean, can you scroll back up to the top of community engagement, please?

549
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:08,928
Where it says in the second paragraph, while we had a limited budget for community engagement, we accomplished a lot.

550
00:48:09,908 --> 00:48:16,091
My suggestion would be, while we had a limited budget for community engagement and no community newspaper to turn to, we accomplished a lot.

551
00:48:26,213 --> 00:48:26,973
We could add that.

552
00:48:27,013 --> 00:48:28,714
I mean, how do people feel about that?

553
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:41,182
It's fine with me.

554
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:44,064
I don't have a strong objection.

555
00:48:46,345 --> 00:48:46,725
Anybody?

556
00:48:46,745 --> 00:48:49,527
Maury.

557
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,479
I mean, what is this doing for?

558
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:57,041
Why are we going through this?

559
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:05,892
I don't think it means anything to what we're trying to do in the big picture of it.

560
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:10,218
We've had meetings upon meetings and subcommittees

561
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:13,911
It's more than the whole project.

562
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,993
I don't want to go through this anymore.

563
00:49:16,513 --> 00:49:17,014
I'm going to vote no.

564
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:17,374
OK.

565
00:49:17,775 --> 00:49:18,635
This is just one.

566
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:20,837
I vote no.

567
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:21,278
OK.

568
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,200
So do we want to vote?

569
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,762
So I guess we're going to vote on whether to add this little line.

570
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:27,464
But Jamie, yeah.

571
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:29,165
Put the I in utilize.

572
00:49:29,406 --> 00:49:31,708
Thank you.

573
00:49:32,408 --> 00:49:32,769
OK.

574
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,872
Maury, let me just say.

575
00:49:37,647 --> 00:49:40,129
Are there any other no votes besides Maury?

576
00:49:40,370 --> 00:49:43,553
Does anybody else object to adding this to the final report?

577
00:49:46,315 --> 00:49:47,076
I'm apathetic.

578
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:48,217
I'm going to abstain.

579
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:49,098
I really.

580
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:49,838
Okay.

581
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:54,803
I think that then we're just going to add it in.

582
00:49:55,584 --> 00:49:56,445
Good.

583
00:49:56,465 --> 00:49:56,585
Okay.

584
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:59,252
Anybody else, any other changes?

585
00:49:59,352 --> 00:50:00,353
Eunice, did you have anything else?

586
00:50:00,974 --> 00:50:03,256
I mean, I'm clearly pissing people off, so I won't bother.

587
00:50:03,276 --> 00:50:04,137
No, you're not.

588
00:50:04,297 --> 00:50:05,998
It's okay, Eunice, if you have something else.

589
00:50:06,459 --> 00:50:10,323
Eunice, you are not pissing me off, dear, at all.

590
00:50:11,404 --> 00:50:12,245
Okay, thank you.

591
00:50:12,785 --> 00:50:20,452
Under the listening sessions, I would just suggest adding that we also had one with ASL interpreters.

592
00:50:21,653 --> 00:50:23,495
That's a good point.

593
00:50:23,555 --> 00:50:27,238
That's where we talked about the Spanish and Haitian Creole part.

594
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:27,879
Yeah.

595
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:30,741
Thank you.

596
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,662
That's a good addition.

597
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:35,325
Jean, you'll add that in, right?

598
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:35,585
Yeah.

599
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:39,368
Happened to be the one that I was the note taker for.

600
00:50:43,305 --> 00:50:45,526
Great, thank you for pointing that out.

601
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:54,790
And then under the interviews of elected and city leaders, I would just add that we also interviewed the current and immediate past superintendent of schools.

602
00:50:57,212 --> 00:50:58,812
Yeah, did that not get in there?

603
00:50:58,832 --> 00:50:59,973
I don't think so.

604
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:06,376
The assistant superintendent too also, was he interviewed or did he just come to our meeting, Eunice?

605
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:10,004
I think maybe he just came to our meeting.

606
00:51:10,064 --> 00:51:10,364
Okay.

607
00:51:10,384 --> 00:51:11,465
Yeah, I don't remember that.

608
00:51:11,845 --> 00:51:15,649
Yeah, we just said, we said city officials, but we could.

609
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:22,937
Yeah, but I just like, you know, highlighting that, you know, it's such a, I think that's a good point.

610
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:28,563
I agree with that, but just because the superintendent is yeah.

611
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:31,212
Current and former superintendents?

612
00:51:31,852 --> 00:51:33,774
I think Belson was interviewed too.

613
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:34,535
Okay.

614
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:37,357
The school committee subcommittee did that.

615
00:51:37,538 --> 00:51:37,738
Yeah.

616
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:41,761
Yes.

617
00:51:41,982 --> 00:51:45,505
If they were included in the sixth, we should change that number, right?

618
00:51:46,863 --> 00:51:49,286
I don't think they were, were they counted in that?

619
00:51:49,326 --> 00:51:53,069
They're really not city officials, so I'm glad we're pointing them out.

620
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,052
Jean, when you wrote this section, did you include them in the six?

621
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,155
I don't remember, so I'll double check.

622
00:51:58,475 --> 00:51:59,136
Okay, thank you.

623
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:13,863
I know under the interview section, if you were trying to, when you listed Alicia Hunt and an assortment of others, didn't you, I think Adam Hurtubise was also interviewed?

624
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,164
Yes, Adam Hurtubise, Alicia Hunt, also Nina Nazarian.

625
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:21,986
And Melissa Ripley, who was the intelligence person at the time.

626
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,067
Yeah, we sort of interviewed her.

627
00:52:24,087 --> 00:52:27,229
We had an email exchange.

628
00:52:28,716 --> 00:52:31,059
And would it be worth it to include?

629
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,922
Yeah, put Melissa Ripley there.

630
00:52:34,323 --> 00:52:35,784
Yeah, and Adam Hernandez.

631
00:52:36,685 --> 00:52:37,646
Oh, yeah, that's right.

632
00:52:37,726 --> 00:52:40,029
Is that the right spelling?

633
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:41,611
Yes, that's right.

634
00:52:44,234 --> 00:52:47,217
Thank you, Eunice, for paying attention to this.

635
00:52:52,646 --> 00:52:54,527
I don't know how you spell that.

636
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,967
You'll check that later, right?

637
00:52:56,067 --> 00:52:56,888
I'll check it, yeah.

638
00:52:57,568 --> 00:53:00,489
I think it's H-U-R-T-I-B-U.

639
00:53:01,229 --> 00:53:02,750
You're his neighbor, don't you?

640
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,990
I know, he is my neighbor.

641
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,651
Yeah, but that's okay.

642
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:07,232
We can double check that later.

643
00:53:07,252 --> 00:53:09,653
We'll make sure that's right.

644
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:14,294
In the appendix, are you listing the subcommittees that we had?

645
00:53:16,955 --> 00:53:22,360
We didn't know that, but that's a good, I think that would be a worthwhile addition.

646
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:37,593
And the last suggestion that I had, and then I'll keep quiet is, um, you know, we go, we go through under here with the recommendations and, you know, we have each article, um, you know, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, you know, uh,

647
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:52,297
I just have this suggestion that we add in, because people are going to look through that and wonder, where's articles 1, 5, and 10?

648
00:53:52,617 --> 00:53:54,459
Yeah, that's true.

649
00:53:54,479 --> 00:54:07,029
I would just add each of those three and state that just a line or two of what they are and based upon,

650
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:12,952
Best practices in a charter, these will be components of our.

651
00:54:13,613 --> 00:54:19,576
Proposed charter or something, so you're talking about under the sort of major recommendation sections.

652
00:54:19,936 --> 00:54:21,637
Yeah, I mean, we have articles.

653
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:28,980
You know, 2, 3, 4, 6, you know, all the rest of them and we're reading that would be like, well, where's 1, 5 and 10.

654
00:54:30,161 --> 00:54:44,510
Well, I mean, the reason they're not there is because we didn't, there weren't, you know, that section just sort of pulls out the major recommendations that we're making in the charter, but in those sections are, didn't have any really sort of recommendations of note.

655
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:45,991
That's why we didn't do that.

656
00:54:46,852 --> 00:54:50,254
But the major recommendation is to add that section.

657
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,476
To have a new modernized charter.

658
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:53,596
Yeah, that's in that.

659
00:54:56,788 --> 00:55:05,780
Yeah, I'm just trying to think of how we would do that.

660
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:10,526
So Eunice, can you just explain where are you suggesting we?

661
00:55:12,021 --> 00:55:23,153
Note this not in the summary, but when you're going right down, you know, when you have so and so you go article to legislative branch recommendations and then you have.

662
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:32,582
You know, so we would say you skipped over article 1, so we would say article 1 incorporation short title definitions.

663
00:55:33,523 --> 00:55:35,405
And just leave it blank.

664
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:36,380
after that?

665
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,601
Is that how you envision it?

666
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:41,242
It's been recommended.

667
00:55:43,363 --> 00:55:49,225
This article, this section is best practice.

668
00:55:50,706 --> 00:55:56,068
Adding this section is best practice for a modern charter or something to that effect.

669
00:55:56,088 --> 00:55:56,828
Am I making sense?

670
00:55:58,229 --> 00:55:59,289
And then the same for 5 and 10.

671
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:15,280
a description of what that particular article does, and that it's a best practice to- To have the Senate charter.

672
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:17,942
What do people think about that idea?

673
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:19,243
Excuse me.

674
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:20,964
I agree.

675
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:27,087
When I was writing it, I felt like it wasn't clear why we were leaving those sections out.

676
00:56:27,147 --> 00:56:30,749
So to me, I did think of what you're saying, Eunice.

677
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,751
Okay.

678
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:34,492
I don't want to use the word lopsided,

679
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:36,209
left-sided.

680
00:56:36,229 --> 00:56:39,971
It could just be a short summary of this.

681
00:56:40,131 --> 00:56:46,153
We added this section, like you said, and it includes definitions or.

682
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:48,194
Okay, Maury, do you have?

683
00:56:48,294 --> 00:56:53,496
I'm just confused by which subcommittee meeting that all of this was held in.

684
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:54,377
Well,

685
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:00,192
You mean, well, we did, we were the final report subcommittee put this together.

686
00:57:00,392 --> 00:57:05,515
I know, and I didn't hear any of this then, so.

687
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:07,897
Well, I know, but Eunice wasn't on that committee, so.

688
00:57:09,197 --> 00:57:14,901
Okay, but you've done plenty of committees with a lot of input previous to this, and I'm just.

689
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:15,561
That's true.

690
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,982
I'm confused by all this.

691
00:57:18,062 --> 00:57:18,423
So.

692
00:57:18,603 --> 00:57:22,705
I'm not a very smart guy, so you have to kind of walk me through this.

693
00:57:22,925 --> 00:57:31,831
Well, I think what we have here is we just pulled out, highlighted some of our main major recommendations in the final report.

694
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:40,477
And there's this thought that since we didn't pull out articles, we didn't mention articles 1, 5, or 10, right?

695
00:57:40,838 --> 00:57:41,218
Do we do 9?

696
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:43,239
We might not have 9 in there either.

697
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:46,582
I think we kind of went.

698
00:57:47,733 --> 00:57:49,773
all through these different articles.

699
00:57:49,853 --> 00:57:50,494
No, we have nine.

700
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:52,434
Okay, good.

701
00:57:52,494 --> 00:58:06,037
So 1, 5, and 10, do we add them here just to sort of illustrate that they exist in this body, in this part of the final report to illustrate that they exist and indicate what they are?

702
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:12,818
And they're all new to the, they would all be new to Medford because Medford hasn't had any of them in the past, right?

703
00:58:12,898 --> 00:58:13,138
So,

704
00:58:15,497 --> 00:58:18,139
So to my mind, there's two ways of doing it.

705
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:33,968
We could, at the very beginning, say articles 1, 5, and 10, and then sort of list what they are and say, you know, to include just a sentence about these or these are included in the chart, or we could put them in order.

706
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:36,890
I would say put them in order, myself.

707
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:37,451
Put them in order.

708
00:58:37,471 --> 00:58:38,131
OK.

709
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:42,654
Why would you be ambiguous to let someone punch holes in it?

710
00:58:47,920 --> 00:59:00,147
The proposal is in the recommendation section to at least make reference in order to Articles 1, 5, and 10, name what they are, and come up with a sentence.

711
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,022
That explains their existence in the charter.

712
00:59:05,282 --> 00:59:06,223
Does that.

713
00:59:06,803 --> 00:59:08,064
Does that sound right units?

714
00:59:08,784 --> 00:59:12,847
Yeah, just like you said, in order, you know, what the.

715
00:59:13,548 --> 00:59:14,709
What the section is.

716
00:59:19,552 --> 00:59:25,975
and then a sentence or two of what that section does.

717
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:36,281
Then based on the best practices of a modern charter, we are recommending that this be included in our charter.

718
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:43,705
That could go to every article, not just those.

719
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:45,831
Yeah, that's true.

720
00:59:45,971 --> 00:59:47,612
I mean, good point.

721
00:59:47,692 --> 00:59:48,352
Exactly.

722
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:50,354
So, I mean, come on.

723
00:59:50,614 --> 00:59:51,655
So, yeah.

724
00:59:52,075 --> 01:00:05,704
So, I guess we'll vote on whether to do that, but I guess what I want to say is if we vote on it and say that language will be crafted as discussed, is that okay?

725
01:00:06,965 --> 01:00:10,568
Yeah, I mean, I'm comfortable with either you or Gene or

726
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:11,655
Yeah.

727
01:00:12,035 --> 01:00:16,158
You know, as part of that committee, I think Phyllis was also part of that committee.

728
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:17,099
Yeah.

729
01:00:17,219 --> 01:00:19,721
Any one of you drafting, you know, something appropriate.

730
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:20,681
Okay.

731
01:00:21,602 --> 01:00:21,842
Okay.

732
01:00:21,982 --> 01:00:25,465
So does everyone understand what the addition we're talking about is?

733
01:00:26,006 --> 01:00:33,611
That we would put Article 1 before this legislative branch recommendations and then we would do the same for 5 and 10.

734
01:00:35,853 --> 01:00:36,534
I'm confused.

735
01:00:37,812 --> 01:00:51,241
Okay, so right now, we have a summary of the major recommendations, and then we go into more detail, and we start with Article 2, because we didn't highlight anything from Article 1.

736
01:00:52,681 --> 01:01:02,228
But the concern is that when you look at that, you say to yourself, well, where's Article 1, and where's Article 5, and where's Article 10?

737
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:04,209
Where's the concern from?

738
01:01:05,743 --> 01:01:08,469
Some of the people that have read it have read the report.

739
01:01:09,592 --> 01:01:12,819
I haven't seen too many people being concerned about it.

740
01:01:13,751 --> 01:01:18,876
Well, we're going to, you know, the proposal on the table is that we add.

741
01:01:19,617 --> 01:01:22,740
So, you're saying there's one person just.

742
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:26,504
No, there are two people that are on my committee.

743
01:01:26,584 --> 01:01:27,445
Okay, go ahead.

744
01:01:27,485 --> 01:01:28,346
We're going to vote on it.

745
01:01:28,386 --> 01:01:29,567
We'll find out if there's more.

746
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:36,074
Looking at it from the point of view of somebody who's going to be reading it.

747
01:01:38,497 --> 01:01:40,599
It's not going to change or add any information.

748
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:42,742
It's just making it easier to kind of go through.

749
01:01:42,762 --> 01:01:47,407
It's not going to change or add any information.

750
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:58,659
It's just adding in those articles in this sort of outline of the charter and our recommendations to sort of show that they will exist in the charter.

751
01:01:59,199 --> 01:01:59,460
Okay.

752
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:01,383
It is clarity.

753
01:02:01,783 --> 01:02:03,324
And I'd like to say something.

754
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:06,367
I don't know about the rest of you.

755
01:02:06,387 --> 01:02:08,108
I am a little tired.

756
01:02:08,388 --> 01:02:09,529
This has been a long journey.

757
01:02:09,569 --> 01:02:11,791
And I've been at the shortest amount of all of you.

758
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:15,254
I'm sorry for that.

759
01:02:15,434 --> 01:02:17,696
But I do appreciate these suggestions.

760
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:18,256
I do.

761
01:02:18,617 --> 01:02:23,681
And I like hearing everyone talk and say what they want to say and do that.

762
01:02:23,861 --> 01:02:27,784
So and a lot of times I thank them for giving me clarity on things, you know.

763
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:32,415
I think that if someone wants to read this, they might say, hey, wait a minute, where are 1 through 1?

764
01:02:32,495 --> 01:02:32,855
Where is 1?

765
01:02:33,176 --> 01:02:33,436
Where is 5?

766
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:34,176
Where is 10?

767
01:02:34,677 --> 01:02:36,638
You know, it's a point I missed, so thanks.

768
01:02:38,259 --> 01:02:39,860
OK, thanks.

769
01:02:40,101 --> 01:02:43,483
OK, so let's vote on whether we wanted to.

770
01:02:43,503 --> 01:02:46,445
Does everyone understand what the proposal is?

771
01:02:46,885 --> 01:02:47,166
Yes.

772
01:02:47,886 --> 01:02:48,206
OK.

773
01:02:50,128 --> 01:02:51,689
All right, let's vote on whether to add it.

774
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:53,130
Danielle?

775
01:02:54,111 --> 01:02:54,351
Yes.

776
01:02:55,592 --> 01:02:55,852
Jean?

777
01:02:58,657 --> 01:02:59,817
Yes, Eunice?

778
01:03:00,217 --> 01:03:01,918
Yes.

779
01:03:02,098 --> 01:03:02,478
Phyllis?

780
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:03,138
Yes.

781
01:03:03,698 --> 01:03:04,138
Maury?

782
01:03:04,598 --> 01:03:04,978
No.

783
01:03:06,018 --> 01:03:07,039
Anthony Andreadola?

784
01:03:10,139 --> 01:03:10,459
Yes.

785
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:12,380
Ron?

786
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:13,720
Yes.

787
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:16,341
I think it's just me, right?

788
01:03:17,681 --> 01:03:18,921
Yeah.

789
01:03:19,101 --> 01:03:19,881
I'm okay with it.

790
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:24,562
I'll say yes, even though I don't really think we have to, but I'm okay with doing it, so I'll say yes.

791
01:03:25,082 --> 01:03:25,362
Okay.

792
01:03:29,398 --> 01:03:32,841
Any other proposals for changes or additions?

793
01:03:34,863 --> 01:03:39,648
I just, I don't know if anyone from the community is on.

794
01:03:40,507 --> 01:03:52,217
Something that we at the beginning of this process was there supposed to be an important part of our meetings was to have a public participation we we we've stopped even asking.

795
01:03:53,337 --> 01:04:06,308
If if there was any public that wanted to comment on things before we voted that we spent a lot of time coming up with a process to ensure that that happened and we're not even

796
01:04:07,085 --> 01:04:08,085
checking right now.

797
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:09,225
So thanks, Anthony.

798
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,726
And I appreciate you bringing that up.

799
01:04:10,806 --> 01:04:16,787
I mean, you know, these votes are about a report that that was read by the committee.

800
01:04:17,007 --> 01:04:26,169
And I so I mean, that's why I didn't ask for public input on it, because, you know, they didn't really read the report.

801
01:04:26,409 --> 01:04:31,510
And so it's not really decision making around the charter.

802
01:04:33,471 --> 01:04:36,653
But I definitely wanted to make.

803
01:04:37,073 --> 01:04:37,733
Yeah, thank you.

804
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:39,154
I appreciate last few meetings.

805
01:04:40,095 --> 01:04:40,495
Okay.

806
01:04:40,635 --> 01:04:43,197
I mean, we always ask for it at the end for sure.

807
01:04:45,438 --> 01:04:49,741
So and Bill, Bill Giglio would like to speak.

808
01:04:49,781 --> 01:04:50,682
So go ahead, Bill.

809
01:04:56,464 --> 01:04:57,604
You're muted, I think.

810
01:04:57,745 --> 01:04:59,846
Oh, I'm sorry.

811
01:04:59,886 --> 01:05:13,277
To that point, and I appreciate Anthony saying that, but I've listened to a lot of these meetings, and I honestly, I don't think I've ever felt like the public hasn't had that chance to speak.

812
01:05:14,098 --> 01:05:18,741
I've always spoke when one wanted to, and you guys have always let me, so I just wanted to let you know that.

813
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:19,082
Thank you.

814
01:05:19,422 --> 01:05:19,862
Thank you.

815
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,043
Okay.

816
01:05:25,562 --> 01:05:29,367
And I do want to open the floor for any comments from anybody.

817
01:05:30,028 --> 01:05:34,234
But is there anybody on the committee that has any changes or additions to the final report?

818
01:05:34,254 --> 01:05:39,381
There's something in the chat.

819
01:05:39,401 --> 01:05:39,721
Hold on.

820
01:05:42,861 --> 01:05:48,625
Oh, Frances gave us the spelling of, that was from before, Danielle, right?

821
01:05:50,507 --> 01:05:51,127
Yeah.

822
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,930
And Jean, can you see that Frances put the spelling of Adam's name?

823
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:55,150
Yeah.

824
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:57,512
Thank you, Frances.

825
01:05:58,173 --> 01:05:58,473
Okay.

826
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:04,978
Okay, so in that case, we're going to vote to accept this final report.

827
01:06:06,107 --> 01:06:12,831
And everybody looked at the appendix, you saw, you know, okay with everything that we included, anything else you think we should include?

828
01:06:13,211 --> 01:06:13,472
Great.

829
01:06:14,112 --> 01:06:14,412
All right.

830
01:06:15,393 --> 01:06:16,213
Final report.

831
01:06:17,294 --> 01:06:28,501
So this is, you're going to vote either yes or no to accept this final report with the additions that we made tonight and the changes we made tonight to be submitted to the mayor.

832
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:30,882
Ron.

833
01:06:30,902 --> 01:06:34,745
Do you want to make it a motion?

834
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:36,694
Okay, sure.

835
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:38,176
I made the motion.

836
01:06:38,897 --> 01:06:40,859
I second it and I vote yes.

837
01:06:41,199 --> 01:06:42,761
Alright, awesome.

838
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:43,221
Eunice?

839
01:06:43,561 --> 01:06:43,822
Yes.

840
01:06:45,684 --> 01:06:46,084
Phyllis?

841
01:06:46,564 --> 01:06:47,025
Yes.

842
01:06:47,826 --> 01:06:48,186
Jean?

843
01:06:48,887 --> 01:06:49,187
Yes.

844
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:51,089
Danielle?

845
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:52,811
Yes.

846
01:06:53,972 --> 01:06:54,913
Anthony Andriagala?

847
01:06:55,514 --> 01:06:55,754
Yes.

848
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,683
Yes, I thought I made the motion originally.

849
01:07:00,923 --> 01:07:03,166
Yeah, you did about the charter.

850
01:07:03,326 --> 01:07:06,049
We got a final report and thank you to everybody now.

851
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:20,643
Jean and I will put it all, make these changes, put it all together.

852
01:07:20,683 --> 01:07:27,066
I think we'll be able to get it to the mayor before the end of the, I mean, I'm saying by Monday, but I don't know.

853
01:07:27,246 --> 01:07:28,326
I can't promise, Jean.

854
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:31,308
I'm going camping, I can't.

855
01:07:32,729 --> 01:07:33,549
Okay, well.

856
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,190
How about by Friday?

857
01:07:36,335 --> 01:07:36,675
Melba.

858
01:07:36,715 --> 01:07:37,696
Next Friday.

859
01:07:37,716 --> 01:07:38,537
Friday's tomorrow.

860
01:07:38,817 --> 01:07:39,217
Oh, next Friday.

861
01:07:39,237 --> 01:07:39,838
Next Friday.

862
01:07:40,058 --> 01:07:40,438
Phyllis.

863
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:43,020
Bill Giglio has his hand raised.

864
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:46,142
I don't know if it's still up from the last time he spoke, but his hand is up.

865
01:07:46,803 --> 01:07:47,063
Yeah.

866
01:07:47,263 --> 01:07:47,563
OK.

867
01:07:47,703 --> 01:07:49,305
We'll check on that for a minute.

868
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:53,408
But I do want to talk to you, Jean, because we'll talk about timeline.

869
01:07:54,688 --> 01:07:55,029
OK.

870
01:07:56,069 --> 01:07:58,291
Bill, Bill, is your hand still up?

871
01:07:58,351 --> 01:07:59,132
I have my hand up.

872
01:07:59,852 --> 01:07:59,952
OK.

873
01:08:00,533 --> 01:08:00,993
OK.

874
01:08:01,093 --> 01:08:03,195
I'll get to everybody whose hands are up.

875
01:08:03,275 --> 01:08:03,755
I promise.

876
01:08:05,484 --> 01:08:06,685
Bill, did you want to say something?

877
01:08:07,945 --> 01:08:12,007
No, I just want to thank each and every one of you guys for taking the time to do this.

878
01:08:12,147 --> 01:08:13,307
You guys really did a great job.

879
01:08:13,848 --> 01:08:14,788
Thank you.

880
01:08:14,848 --> 01:08:17,169
Everyone's been asking for the chatter review.

881
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:19,630
I'm just disappointed on the community.

882
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:26,700
you know, not getting involved as much as we've been hearing people wanting change.

883
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:33,162
And I know Eunice alone has been doing everything to promote as much as she could with this and everybody else.

884
01:08:33,222 --> 01:08:37,063
But it's just disappointing that the community didn't get a little more involved.

885
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:42,544
But in any event, I probably listened to about 80% of the meetings and I really appreciate what you guys did.

886
01:08:42,564 --> 01:08:43,144
Thank you very much.

887
01:08:43,404 --> 01:08:44,184
Thank you so much.

888
01:08:44,624 --> 01:08:46,385
Okay, Maury and then Danielle.

889
01:08:46,405 --> 01:08:46,705
Maury.

890
01:08:48,239 --> 01:09:05,187
I just want to thank everybody from day one for everything that we've done, whether on the left side or the right side, we've come together here and it's been a great experience and I appreciate everybody and hope we all know each other better.

891
01:09:05,727 --> 01:09:05,988
Yeah.

892
01:09:06,488 --> 01:09:07,188
Thanks, Maureen.

893
01:09:08,029 --> 01:09:08,369
Danielle.

894
01:09:09,966 --> 01:09:16,113
I was going to say something similar just how grateful I am to have met all of you and to work together on this and also specifically to Milva.

895
01:09:16,133 --> 01:09:20,718
I think it can maybe feel like a thankless job like wrangling all of us all the time.

896
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:28,026
I know the first time I met you this felt like a really far away goal and so I just hope that you feel really proud of everything that

897
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:29,267
Yeah.

898
01:09:29,307 --> 01:09:29,707
Thanks.

899
01:09:30,488 --> 01:09:30,828
Yeah.

900
01:09:31,408 --> 01:09:33,570
This has been in the works for years, you guys.

901
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,333
And I do want to just speak briefly.

902
01:09:37,514 --> 01:09:41,177
Francis is putting a note, appreciation note as well.

903
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:41,877
Nice job.

904
01:09:41,937 --> 01:09:45,740
I appreciate all the diverse thought perspectives that have led to the completion of this group.

905
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:46,881
Thank you, Francis.

906
01:09:48,362 --> 01:09:52,483
I want to just talk, before we wrap up, I want to talk briefly about what happens next.

907
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:56,144
But I also just, like I said, it's been a long time.

908
01:09:56,204 --> 01:09:58,964
People have been talking about charter review in the city for so many years.

909
01:09:59,044 --> 01:10:06,486
And regardless of what happens next, we, a citizen-led committee, did this work.

910
01:10:06,586 --> 01:10:07,426
We did a review.

911
01:10:07,766 --> 01:10:09,446
And that final report will exist.

912
01:10:11,127 --> 01:10:15,148
And no matter what happens, it's there and the work has been done.

913
01:10:15,168 --> 01:10:16,548
And I really thank all of you.

914
01:10:17,238 --> 01:10:21,683
And I also thank the Collins Center, whose help has been invaluable.

915
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:27,329
And all the members of the public who came to our meetings and participated.

916
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:34,136
Because we did have a good amount of public participation when you add up the listening sessions, surveys, and all our meetings.

917
01:10:34,437 --> 01:10:35,198
So thank you.

918
01:10:37,052 --> 01:10:39,013
So Jean and I will just coordinate.

919
01:10:39,614 --> 01:10:40,995
We will get this to the mayor.

920
01:10:41,895 --> 01:10:46,458
And after that, it's basically in the mayor's hands.

921
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,862
And eventually, the city council will be involved.

922
01:10:53,142 --> 01:11:01,428
And we'll see what, I know Eunice did tell everyone about a city council meeting next week.

923
01:11:01,868 --> 01:11:03,389
Next Wednesday night, 7 p.m.

924
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:14,956
And if people want to go to that, you know, it's not any, there's no official capacity for us to go to that meeting, but.

925
01:11:15,296 --> 01:11:17,597
Phyllis is laughing.

926
01:11:17,637 --> 01:11:18,558
Go to another meeting?

927
01:11:19,698 --> 01:11:20,858
No, no, no.

928
01:11:20,898 --> 01:11:22,339
You can read what's in the chat, Melva.

929
01:11:22,459 --> 01:11:27,081
Oh, I'm placing a barbecue for all of you.

930
01:11:27,201 --> 01:11:27,821
I'm sorry.

931
01:11:31,342 --> 01:11:34,714
Maury, I don't know Maury, there's a rumor going around.

932
01:11:34,734 --> 01:11:37,263
Do kind of you Maury, we appreciate it.

933
01:11:38,397 --> 01:11:39,899
Oh, really?

934
01:11:39,919 --> 01:11:40,860
What's the rumor?

935
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,902
That you're going to host a barbecue for all of us.

936
01:11:43,922 --> 01:11:46,925
Oh, I'll do that any day of the week.

937
01:11:46,965 --> 01:11:47,566
You know that.

938
01:11:47,646 --> 01:11:49,968
Can you talk to Danielle?

939
01:11:50,508 --> 01:11:52,070
Does Murray have ice cream?

940
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:53,051
I don't know.

941
01:11:53,071 --> 01:11:54,212
Frances will ask him.

942
01:11:54,652 --> 01:11:57,155
No, so I can bring that in, whatever you like.

943
01:11:57,715 --> 01:11:57,835
OK.

944
01:11:57,995 --> 01:12:00,438
All right.

945
01:12:00,558 --> 01:12:01,839
Wait, somebody else had their hand up.

946
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:02,920
Oh, I did.

947
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:02,980
OK.

948
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:05,760
Always with you, Jean.

949
01:12:06,101 --> 01:12:06,801
Yeah, me.

950
01:12:06,861 --> 01:12:09,622
I'm just going to make this go to 830.

951
01:12:11,502 --> 01:12:15,684
Should we have a representative attend City Council, I guess, was my question.

952
01:12:15,704 --> 01:12:22,966
And should we nominate someone or a group of us taking turns to answer any questions City Council has?

953
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:27,888
I feel like just handing it to them without any presence of the committee might

954
01:12:29,719 --> 01:12:33,581
Yeah, well, I don't know that they'll like their meeting.

955
01:12:33,922 --> 01:12:35,082
She's exactly right.

956
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,003
Yeah.

957
01:12:36,963 --> 01:12:40,806
I'm with you, Jean, right by your shoulders.

958
01:12:40,846 --> 01:12:41,526
You know that.

959
01:12:41,826 --> 01:12:43,267
Well, their meeting is scheduled.

960
01:12:43,527 --> 01:12:46,069
Their first meeting on this is scheduled for Wednesday.

961
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:52,693
And I don't know that they'll have I don't know what material they'll have seen of ours before that.

962
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,855
But Ron and then you know, show up.

963
01:12:56,466 --> 01:13:03,448
Yeah, I think my point is that our presentation has not been presented to them yet.

964
01:13:03,948 --> 01:13:14,250
So I don't think it's necessarily, you know, I'd be happy to answer questions about once they read our presentation, but to reinvent the wheel with them again, just doesn't seem to make sense to us.

965
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:19,532
If they were calling us in to ask questions of what we voted on, happy to do that.

966
01:13:19,632 --> 01:13:21,732
But this is kind of like, what do you guys think again?

967
01:13:21,752 --> 01:13:24,313
And I just don't think we represent, you know,

968
01:13:25,445 --> 01:13:26,106
That's my opinion.

969
01:13:26,126 --> 01:13:28,647
I think we should wait until they have it in hand and have read it.

970
01:13:29,248 --> 01:13:31,449
Let me ask you this.

971
01:13:31,489 --> 01:13:34,591
You've been around probably longer than I have, aren't you?

972
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:34,932
No.

973
01:13:35,432 --> 01:13:37,854
No, I haven't.

974
01:13:37,934 --> 01:13:38,754
I know I haven't.

975
01:13:39,855 --> 01:13:43,037
Anyway, make a long story short.

976
01:13:44,498 --> 01:13:47,781
Just the presence of alone gets these people upset.

977
01:13:48,769 --> 01:13:55,577
and they start questioning where they come from, especially the ones that only been there a year or two or three years.

978
01:13:56,698 --> 01:14:04,207
And it may not be a bad idea to just sit in the audience, and I'd be happy to do that.

979
01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:14,892
Okay, I think we're citizens, we can listen to any meeting we want to say in an official capacity, you know, we know what I'm saying.

980
01:14:15,193 --> 01:14:18,816
Yeah, this document is what they should be asking questions.

981
01:14:18,836 --> 01:14:20,898
Well, the question of the group.

982
01:14:22,707 --> 01:14:27,149
Is this group officially dissolved as at the end of this meeting?

983
01:14:27,169 --> 01:14:28,229
That's a good question.

984
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:32,151
I mean, I don't think that there's anything official about it.

985
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:35,972
I can tell you that this will be our last meeting.

986
01:14:35,992 --> 01:14:40,674
We don't have any other meetings scheduled and we will be submitting our final report.

987
01:14:42,794 --> 01:14:46,976
The mayor might ask us to participate in some meetings in the future.

988
01:14:48,536 --> 01:14:49,537
That's going to be up to her.

989
01:14:51,348 --> 01:15:02,074
I don't know, like, if there's an official dissolution, but we are, you know, we just voted to submit our final report, and that'll be, you know, our work is done.

990
01:15:02,094 --> 01:15:06,037
The only thing I'm concerned about is protocol.

991
01:15:06,657 --> 01:15:10,219
I'm just concerned about protocol, that it goes to the mayor who appointed us.

992
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:17,243
We shouldn't be talking about that presentation until the mayor has handed it over to city council, is my opinion.

993
01:15:17,677 --> 01:15:19,237
Then we can talk about details.

994
01:15:19,337 --> 01:15:24,339
I think having a discussion about what we voted on is not fair to the process.

995
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:24,899
And that's all.

996
01:15:25,259 --> 01:15:25,719
I'm happy.

997
01:15:25,759 --> 01:15:26,939
No, I hear you, Ron.

998
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:27,639
I hear you.

999
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:28,080
I understand.

1000
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:28,940
I want to talk about it.

1001
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,561
But whether we're commissioned or decommissioned, we are always part of history that we created it.

1002
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:40,443
So we're always going to be somewhat experts on the subject matter of why we voted for what we voted for.

1003
01:15:40,823 --> 01:15:42,143
But to me, it's good.

1004
01:15:42,203 --> 01:15:46,504
The process is the mayor who appointed us should get to look at it.

1005
01:15:47,012 --> 01:15:50,994
She'll decide when it goes to city council and then they can bring us in and we have a great discussion.

1006
01:15:51,294 --> 01:15:53,576
But to do it beforehand, it doesn't make sense.

1007
01:15:53,716 --> 01:16:03,621
I hear you, but we are still living with the reality that the council's governance committee is having a meeting on charter review on Wednesday.

1008
01:16:03,761 --> 01:16:04,722
It's been publicized.

1009
01:16:04,782 --> 01:16:08,124
So I hear you.

1010
01:16:08,804 --> 01:16:13,787
Milva, how are they going to review this if we're not giving it to the mayor till Monday?

1011
01:16:14,950 --> 01:16:17,512
I know, or maybe not until the end of the week.

1012
01:16:17,632 --> 01:16:21,055
Well, it depends on the timeline.

1013
01:16:21,095 --> 01:16:22,916
May I ask another question?

1014
01:16:23,096 --> 01:16:23,616
I'm sorry.

1015
01:16:24,597 --> 01:16:27,879
Can a city council do a charter?

1016
01:16:28,119 --> 01:16:42,870
I was under the impression that elected officials, it's a separate process that they can do amendments, but they can't actually write a charter themselves.

1017
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,580
Am I incorrect?

1018
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,822
I don't know if you're correct or incorrect, Anthony.

1019
01:16:47,842 --> 01:16:57,666
Let's ask Anthony or Marilyn, I mean, yeah, about that.

1020
01:16:58,166 --> 01:17:12,713
Some communities have a charter review process in their charter and we have seen councils make significant revisions to charters and in some cases,

1021
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:21,648
A committee is appointed that includes members that are chosen by the mayor and members that are chosen by the council.

1022
01:17:21,708 --> 01:17:25,091
And then this committee presents their report to the council.

1023
01:17:26,473 --> 01:17:28,855
And councils have taken this on themselves, too.

1024
01:17:31,197 --> 01:17:32,178
You mean charter review?

1025
01:17:32,298 --> 01:17:33,759
Taken charter review on themselves?

1026
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:34,700
Yes.

1027
01:17:36,784 --> 01:17:37,764
I need to say something here.

1028
01:17:37,784 --> 01:17:38,825
Go ahead, Leonis.

1029
01:17:39,165 --> 01:17:50,173
The city council has made it perfectly clear in several meetings this year that they will be writing a charter.

1030
01:17:50,973 --> 01:18:03,983
They will consider the work that we have done, and their feeling is, and you can go back and look at the tapes, I think I've actually provided them to you before, that because

1031
01:18:04,743 --> 01:18:08,628
The mayor appointed us and we are not elected.

1032
01:18:08,648 --> 01:18:10,931
The work is illegitimate.

1033
01:18:11,191 --> 01:18:20,143
That is the word that has been used and that because we are not an elected commission or committee that.

1034
01:18:22,373 --> 01:18:31,659
Basically, the elected officials will be writing a charter and that is their feeling on this.

1035
01:18:31,719 --> 01:18:41,967
The governance committee, this iteration of the city council has decided that in this two-year term, they would be writing a charter.

1036
01:18:42,887 --> 01:18:48,268
Um, and as I said earlier, um, they've been bantering around the idea for a while.

1037
01:18:48,288 --> 01:19:02,932
Um, then, uh, they're now getting started on it and, um, uh, I communicated with Justin saying the committee to make sure of, um, the date of the meeting.

1038
01:19:03,092 --> 01:19:08,893
And he said we would be invited to all future meetings and in the, um,

1039
01:19:10,002 --> 01:19:17,988
resident engagement committee that they had last week, where they touched on the charter as part of writing up their monthly newsletter.

1040
01:19:19,689 --> 01:19:38,762
Counselor Zhang specifically said that he noticed that there was a member of the charter committee on the resident engagement committee Zoom last week, that being me, and that he would hoped that I would share with the group that they're not trying to step on anybody's toes.

1041
01:19:39,603 --> 01:19:45,627
quote unquote, but they are beginning to write their own charter.

1042
01:19:47,028 --> 01:19:50,110
So my question to you guys is this.

1043
01:19:51,891 --> 01:20:08,042
I also think that it's a good idea for us to be present at these meetings, whether in person or on Zoom, just to let them know that we're there and that we've done all this and that we're there.

1044
01:20:09,579 --> 01:20:10,739
We're not going away.

1045
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:32,084
But would it be proper and appropriate for us to be asking questions of them as they do their work or answering questions that might be posed if they see one of us on a Zoom or sitting in chambers?

1046
01:20:34,824 --> 01:20:36,925
If they were to ask us questions,

1047
01:20:39,348 --> 01:20:41,409
would it be appropriate for us to be answering?

1048
01:20:43,030 --> 01:21:06,079
I know at the low profile for the 22 months where we've spoken as one voice and I know we've all watched some of these meetings and I know nobody has spoken up because we made that agreement early on that we would just sit back quietly and do our work and be diligent and get to this point and here we are.

1049
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,080
Okay, thanks, Eunice.

1050
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:09,461
Maury, did you wanna say something?

1051
01:21:12,042 --> 01:21:35,451
Yeah, I hear exactly what Eunice is saying, but I think our approach should be at this point, let them show their hand and let us sit up, let us sit outside to be able to punch holes in them, because they're gonna sit up, they're gonna sit there and just punch holes in everything that we have done.

1052
01:21:37,147 --> 01:21:39,908
That's how this goes.

1053
01:21:40,148 --> 01:21:55,013
So why don't we just sit outside, listen to what they have to say, and go back to the mayor and say, this is our thing, and how do we find a happy balance here?

1054
01:21:55,353 --> 01:21:56,413
That's all I'm saying.

1055
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,554
Let's not go out there and punch.

1056
01:21:59,094 --> 01:22:06,096
We are going to produce our document, which explains all of our work over this

1057
01:22:07,043 --> 01:22:07,703
I'm period.

1058
01:22:09,304 --> 01:22:11,385
And they're gonna, they have none.

1059
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:16,147
They're pulling straws just to kick us in the ass.

1060
01:22:17,587 --> 01:22:19,028
They've done nothing.

1061
01:22:19,368 --> 01:22:29,952
And you follow this very clearly that they keep talking about their charter study committee, their governance committee.

1062
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:34,894
They've done nothing, so let's call them out.

1063
01:22:34,994 --> 01:22:36,636
Let them show their hand.

1064
01:22:37,176 --> 01:22:42,281
We already have our hand, and let's just sit back and wait and see.

1065
01:22:42,881 --> 01:22:43,802
Okay, thank you.

1066
01:22:43,842 --> 01:22:44,202
Phyllis?

1067
01:22:46,525 --> 01:22:53,311
I may be hearing things incorrectly, but is what you're saying, Eunice, and is that

1068
01:22:53,733 --> 01:22:57,396
All the work that the committee has done here can be just tossed aside.

1069
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,937
Yes, yes.

1070
01:22:58,977 --> 01:23:01,598
Yeah, that's that's how exactly how I interpret it.

1071
01:23:02,259 --> 01:23:05,721
The word was used and I'll go back and find the.

1072
01:23:06,782 --> 01:23:09,444
The tape, we're not elected.

1073
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,421
There was one meeting where those comments were made.

1074
01:23:14,181 --> 01:23:14,861
Exactly, yes.

1075
01:23:15,181 --> 01:23:18,702
I do think that they will look at our report and take it seriously.

1076
01:23:19,142 --> 01:23:20,402
Well, we hope they will.

1077
01:23:20,922 --> 01:23:21,663
I think they will.

1078
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:22,803
We'll see.

1079
01:23:23,203 --> 01:23:26,524
So do I. Anthony Wilson, can I ask you a question?

1080
01:23:30,365 --> 01:23:32,025
Through the chair, yeah.

1081
01:23:32,045 --> 01:23:32,705
Thank you, Anthony.

1082
01:23:32,725 --> 01:23:32,925
Go ahead.

1083
01:23:33,385 --> 01:23:34,105
I'm sorry, Melba.

1084
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:36,086
That's OK.

1085
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:36,606
Anthony.

1086
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:53,175
Have you, or is it Marie, have you had instances where a committee, a charity study group has been appointed by a mayor, and then all of that work has been tossed aside by city council?

1087
01:23:55,575 --> 01:23:56,976
Marilyn, I don't know if you want to chime in.

1088
01:23:57,016 --> 01:23:57,736
I don't have anything.

1089
01:23:57,816 --> 01:23:58,316
I'm sorry.

1090
01:23:58,376 --> 01:23:59,676
I was saying, Marie, I'm sorry.

1091
01:24:02,017 --> 01:24:02,217
Yes.

1092
01:24:03,597 --> 01:24:07,038
There was a committee that in one city

1093
01:24:07,528 --> 01:24:09,249
and the council refused to take it up.

1094
01:24:13,892 --> 01:24:14,092
Yeah.

1095
01:24:14,412 --> 01:24:14,733
Okay.

1096
01:24:15,033 --> 01:24:15,453
Thank you.

1097
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:16,454
Jean.

1098
01:24:16,654 --> 01:24:18,415
Sorry, but these things happen.

1099
01:24:18,795 --> 01:24:21,657
Yeah.

1100
01:24:21,677 --> 01:24:26,660
I made the comment in the spirit of hoping it would be a collaborative process with the city council.

1101
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:33,665
I do think there is intention there for them to consider the work that we have done, at least what I've heard from counselors.

1102
01:24:34,623 --> 01:24:48,512
But I think Ron raised a good point that we are appointed by the mayor and I wonder if we could get clarity from the mayor on what our role is once we hand this report to her and are we.

1103
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:52,384
Officially still committee members like if.

1104
01:24:53,364 --> 01:24:58,587
If Eunice wants to go to a meeting, is she going as Eunice a citizen or units as a committee member?

1105
01:24:59,028 --> 01:25:01,729
Does the mayor want us to have any engagement with city?

1106
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:02,370
I guess.

1107
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:05,912
Given how we were appointed, we should.

1108
01:25:06,552 --> 01:25:09,995
Get our marching orders from the mayor as to the next.

1109
01:25:10,675 --> 01:25:17,239
Yeah, so what I've heard from the mayor is that if committee members want to go to these meetings.

1110
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:18,200
It's.

1111
01:25:19,356 --> 01:25:22,758
Since we are invested, we're so invested in it.

1112
01:25:23,578 --> 01:25:26,960
So I guess what I would say is it's up to you.

1113
01:25:26,980 --> 01:25:32,643
I mean, I hear Ron's point and I do think that it's legitimate.

1114
01:25:34,552 --> 01:25:43,118
Because we do have this body of work and there is a process that's going to take place where it's going to go to the mayor and then the mayor presents it to the city council.

1115
01:25:44,018 --> 01:25:49,542
And it's a little unclear to me what the council is doing at the next two meetings that they've scheduled.

1116
01:25:49,802 --> 01:25:53,565
So I think it's okay if people want to attend.

1117
01:25:55,186 --> 01:25:56,627
But, you know,

1118
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:05,742
The process that we were appointed for was to create this report for the mayor, which we have done.

1119
01:26:05,922 --> 01:26:14,048
And then there will be a process that will be up to the mayor, what she does with what we've submitted.

1120
01:26:14,908 --> 01:26:23,995
So if we do go to the council meetings, I don't think it would be in, I don't know if I would use the word official, but I think it's fine for people to go.

1121
01:26:24,015 --> 01:26:28,218
And it's unclear, you know,

1122
01:26:29,078 --> 01:26:33,140
what we would, I mean, even just to listen, it's fine for people to go.

1123
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:37,283
So I think it's up to people whether they want to.

1124
01:26:37,463 --> 01:26:37,783
Ron?

1125
01:26:38,863 --> 01:26:45,467
Yeah, I'd also like to find out if, because we voted on it today, does it become part of public record as of today?

1126
01:26:45,487 --> 01:26:52,331
Or when the final, when you clean it up and present it to the mayor on next Friday or whatever, is that when it becomes public?

1127
01:26:52,351 --> 01:26:53,652
Because I think that's very important.

1128
01:26:54,232 --> 01:26:55,853
There's a document that's not public

1129
01:26:56,542 --> 01:27:00,925
should not be presented at any public meetings other than where it's intended.

1130
01:27:00,965 --> 01:27:02,846
So I think we need to have a decision on that too.

1131
01:27:02,866 --> 01:27:13,313
I don't want to start getting in the weeds and I appreciate Danielle's, you know, we're citizens first, you know, we can have an opinion on this stuff for sure.

1132
01:27:13,413 --> 01:27:16,635
But when we're wearing the hat of charter,

1133
01:27:17,195 --> 01:27:39,907
I think we have to really be careful what is a public document what's not a public document until the in my opinion The mayor deserves first look But if we're not presenting it to the mayor, they'll say say we haven't cleaned it up until friday Which is reasonable if we go wednesday and pull out the document that we see as of right now I just don't I just don't think it's a it's a professional way.

1134
01:27:39,947 --> 01:27:45,530
No, I don't think anybody's pulling out a document but but uh, danielle your question, I mean

1135
01:27:46,413 --> 01:27:47,874
All our meetings have been public.

1136
01:27:48,134 --> 01:27:49,595
All our votes have been public.

1137
01:27:49,835 --> 01:27:58,320
So I think it's fine if somebody says, well, what's going to happen with ward representation?

1138
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:01,242
I think it's fine to say, well, the committee voted.

1139
01:28:01,282 --> 01:28:03,643
We can say what we voted on.

1140
01:28:03,703 --> 01:28:05,044
That's all public.

1141
01:28:05,945 --> 01:28:11,068
We want to get together in the future to be like, let's show up at this thing.

1142
01:28:11,128 --> 01:28:12,309
Communicate as a group.

1143
01:28:12,369 --> 01:28:13,309
It's OK to do that.

1144
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:14,130
It doesn't violate.

1145
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:20,761
And you mean if we, if, if some of us, but we wouldn't be meeting as the metric charter study committee.

1146
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:24,522
Yeah, I guess that's my question is like when somebody asks, are we dissolved?

1147
01:28:24,722 --> 01:28:26,663
Like we are no longer defined in that way.

1148
01:28:26,703 --> 01:28:28,184
So we're not calling any of it.

1149
01:28:28,244 --> 01:28:28,424
Yeah.

1150
01:28:28,444 --> 01:28:30,085
We're not calling any official meetings.

1151
01:28:30,965 --> 01:28:36,607
Um, I mean, I mean, when we go to more barbecue, for instance, I don't think we'll violate open meeting.

1152
01:28:36,627 --> 01:28:36,867
Yeah.

1153
01:28:45,215 --> 01:28:59,546
Because I follow all this so closely, I'm happy to keep everybody updated as to when the meetings are using our email chain that we've had.

1154
01:28:59,566 --> 01:29:05,471
Then that way, people can show up or log on as they wish and see you there.

1155
01:29:11,444 --> 01:29:13,886
I think it's fine to let people know when the meetings are.

1156
01:29:13,906 --> 01:29:16,687
Yeah.

1157
01:29:16,707 --> 01:29:26,333
I think that a lot of this is going to become clearer as the process unfolds, it will become clearer.

1158
01:29:26,353 --> 01:29:34,557
Frankly, I don't think that the city council is going to get terribly far with this in this term.

1159
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:35,077
Thank you, Jean.

1160
01:29:39,888 --> 01:29:40,729
You take care.

1161
01:29:40,749 --> 01:29:42,711
Thanks for all your contributions.

1162
01:29:43,693 --> 01:29:45,215
I'll be in touch about the timeline.

1163
01:29:45,235 --> 01:29:47,337
See you at the barbecue.

1164
01:29:47,357 --> 01:29:48,819
Bring the ice cream.

1165
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:53,605
You know, I don't think they're going to get too far.

1166
01:29:53,665 --> 01:30:03,531
I mean, they seem to be, you know, intent on getting this done before the end of this term, which, you know, they have, what, 14, 15 months left.

1167
01:30:03,611 --> 01:30:12,457
I mean, keep in mind, you know, I know we all have other lives and other jobs and families and things, but working on this charter has been our only job for 22 months.

1168
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:18,260
And we've clearly put in the time to do it.

1169
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:23,783
They, in addition to having their own lives and jobs and things like that, have.

1170
01:30:24,843 --> 01:30:28,145
You know, a governing the city, they're writing tree ordinances.

1171
01:30:28,185 --> 01:30:30,146
They're writing rodent ordinances.

1172
01:30:30,186 --> 01:30:35,930
They're passing a budget, you know, dealing with potholes all sorts of other things.

1173
01:30:37,130 --> 01:30:41,433
You know, it takes them a year to write a leaf blower ordinance.

1174
01:30:42,133 --> 01:30:44,034
You know, are they really going to get a charter written 14 months?

1175
01:30:46,078 --> 01:30:47,118
I don't know.

1176
01:30:47,999 --> 01:30:54,001
Yeah, like I said, it's unclear exactly and it will become clear as it unfolds.

1177
01:30:54,021 --> 01:30:56,202
I think this is all I can really say.

1178
01:30:56,222 --> 01:30:57,402
Exactly.

1179
01:30:58,182 --> 01:31:00,383
Phyllis, did you want to?

1180
01:31:00,523 --> 01:31:04,825
No, I was just shaking my head, trying to think of all the things that we're talking about.

1181
01:31:05,985 --> 01:31:07,506
Did you have something else you wanted to say, Ron?

1182
01:31:08,146 --> 01:31:08,666
No, sorry.

1183
01:31:09,906 --> 01:31:10,206
Okay.

1184
01:31:10,767 --> 01:31:17,590
So, um, does anybody, does anybody else on the committee have anything that they want to address or.

1185
01:31:19,672 --> 01:31:25,255
No, I just want to say that I have learned so much from being part of this group.

1186
01:31:26,756 --> 01:31:31,438
I had, I had some idea about what went on in the city, but I didn't know all the ins and outs.

1187
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:33,179
So I want to thank everybody.

1188
01:31:33,499 --> 01:31:36,561
Um, I want to thank, I'll thank the mayor for the opportunity.

1189
01:31:36,661 --> 01:31:38,022
Thank you for all your hard work.

1190
01:31:38,432 --> 01:31:41,073
Thank you to everybody that showed up every week.

1191
01:31:41,694 --> 01:31:45,956
It was a lot of hard work, and the conversations were really enlightening.

1192
01:31:45,976 --> 01:31:56,160
I could only see something one way sometimes, and then I'd listen to Ron or Anthony or Mari or Eunice or everybody, and I would go, oh, wait a minute, let me think about it that way.

1193
01:31:56,741 --> 01:32:00,202
For me, that was a very, very rewarding experience.

1194
01:32:00,222 --> 01:32:02,163
So my sincere thanks to all of you.

1195
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:02,703
Thank you.

1196
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:03,604
Thank you, Phyllis.

1197
01:32:04,964 --> 01:32:08,285
Okay, does anybody, any members of the public want to speak?

1198
01:32:14,067 --> 01:32:14,407
Okay.

1199
01:32:16,628 --> 01:32:28,873
I'll just add as well, you know, my thanks to everybody and it's been a pleasure getting to know those who I didn't know before and working with everybody, you know, and

1200
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:38,463
hashing things out and deliberating and debating and we came up with a pretty darn good product for the city.

1201
01:32:39,023 --> 01:32:54,133
I ran into Brianna in Wegmans on Saturday at the deli counter and talked a little bit about this and I ended with the following, somebody ought to canonize Melva for sainthood.

1202
01:32:56,044 --> 01:32:57,005
Not even close.

1203
01:32:58,046 --> 01:32:58,526
Thank you.

1204
01:32:58,546 --> 01:33:04,291
Thank you for keeping us together, keeping our spirits up, keeping us organized.

1205
01:33:05,452 --> 01:33:06,572
Everything that you've done.

1206
01:33:07,153 --> 01:33:13,798
When Larwell left, I think a few of us suggested that maybe somebody else take the co-chair seat with you.

1207
01:33:13,818 --> 01:33:17,661
And you took it on by yourself.

1208
01:33:19,429 --> 01:33:23,350
You know, and we were not an easy group to corral sometimes.

1209
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:24,290
You guys are all great.

1210
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:26,011
So I've heard in cats.

1211
01:33:26,371 --> 01:33:29,652
Just for the record, Eunice, she only had one miracle.

1212
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:32,472
There's two more to go.

1213
01:33:32,492 --> 01:33:32,533
OK.

1214
01:33:35,113 --> 01:33:37,694
You know, thank you, Milva, for keeping us all together.

1215
01:33:37,814 --> 01:33:40,035
And thank you to everybody else.

1216
01:33:40,255 --> 01:33:41,695
It's been quite a journey.

1217
01:33:41,775 --> 01:33:44,536
And I can't believe it's finally over.

1218
01:33:44,556 --> 01:33:44,896
I know.

1219
01:33:45,831 --> 01:33:46,191
Yeah.

1220
01:33:46,611 --> 01:33:50,152
Well, again, I want to just thank you all.

1221
01:33:52,233 --> 01:33:55,514
It's been a great experience.

1222
01:33:55,874 --> 01:33:59,795
Once we get the final report, just make those few changes, clean it up.

1223
01:33:59,935 --> 01:34:06,317
I will let you-all know when it's submitted so you know that it's been submitted to the mayor.

1224
01:34:06,337 --> 01:34:06,417
Okay?

1225
01:34:07,258 --> 01:34:07,678
Okay.

1226
01:34:09,538 --> 01:34:12,439
Anthony and Marilyn too for all of you guys.

1227
01:34:12,919 --> 01:34:13,059
Yes.

1228
01:34:13,099 --> 01:34:13,419
Exactly.

1229
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:13,520
Yes.

1230
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:14,640
We really appreciate it.

1231
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:18,208
Yeah.

1232
01:34:18,789 --> 01:34:20,870
We could not have done it without the call and center.

1233
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:21,530
Absolutely.

1234
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:22,070
So okay.

1235
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,831
Motion to adjourn.

1236
01:34:23,931 --> 01:34:29,634
I make a motion to adjourn our final meeting.

1237
01:34:29,894 --> 01:34:31,635
We can keep talking for another 22 minutes.

1238
01:34:32,235 --> 01:34:32,495
All right.

1239
01:34:32,515 --> 01:34:32,915
All in favor.

1240
01:34:44,208 --> 01:34:46,800
I thank you again everyone around the city.
