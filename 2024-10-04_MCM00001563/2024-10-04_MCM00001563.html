    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=0.511">Welcome</a>  everyone to the October 3rd, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=6.494">And</a>  a couple more people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=10.756">And</a>  then we'll get to our first order of business.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=13.577">I'll</a>  shoot Phyllis a message.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=15.558">I</a>  think she just came in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=16.719">I</a>  think she's just come in.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=17.999">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=23.302">That's</a>  Phyllis, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=25.863">Phyllis</a>  Fong? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=26.383">I</a>  think that's Phyllis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=29.426">All</a>  right, so the first order of business is the minutes from our last meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=34.83">Did</a>  everyone have a chance to look at them? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=38.013">Are</a>  we good? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=38.533">Do</a>  we need any changes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=42.356">Second?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=46.58">Second.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=48.181">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=48.782">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=52.024">Any</a>  opposed? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=53.706">All</a>  right, so I will get those minutes posted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=58.629">Frances,</a>  thanks for the message. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=61.131">We'll</a>  keep an eye on the chat in case you have any comments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=67.255">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=68.396">Thank</a>  you for the congratulations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=70.197">So</a>  this is scheduled to be our final meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=74.601">I</a>  want to thank everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=76.903">It's</a>  been long, but it's been really positive and productive, and I really can't thank you all enough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=87.66">I</a>  also want to thank the Collins Center, who is with us tonight, Anthony Wilson, and I believe Marilyn is also here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=94.722">So</a>  the work we have to do tonight is we just have to vote on the final draft of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=103.838">charter</a>  and the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=105.919">So</a>  I guess the first thing I want to say, let's do the charter document first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=111.422">And</a>  I just want to make an announcement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=114.824">There</a>  was like a little clerical issue and section 919, because we had discussed putting the compensation committee in the charter, but then we voted to just recommend it as an ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=129.911">just</a>  based on some of the discussions, it ended up in the draft charter, so that's being removed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=135.016">Just</a>  in case anybody noticed that, I'm just letting everybody know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=140.841">Section</a>  919 will be removed as we voted and it was mentioned in the final report as a recommendation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=151.491">Now,</a>  I'll open the floor to see if anybody has any <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=154.956">to</a>  bring up about the charter document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=158.439">And</a>  then we'll do the final report after that.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=164.061">question.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=165.102">I'd</a>  like to know that we've gone through the charter document and the resolutions and where it stands and how we go that this body approves this and to move it forward to the city council.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=180.428">Okay,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=182.809">I</a>  just want to hear what Eunice's comment was and then we'll do that motion.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=186.411">I</a>  do also.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=187.491">Okay,</a>  I have 1 comment on 1 section that I just had a question about and then just sort of a general. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=196.554">You</a>  know, I'm not sure if it belongs in the charter or if it's maybe governed by state law, but my question is under section 3 dash for the removal or suspension of certain officials. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=214.353">And</a>  it says at the end of the paragraph, and this is about removals obviously of department heads and city officers and so forth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=229.002">The</a>  removal shall take effect on the 30th day following the date of filing in the office of the city clerk the notice of removal by the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=240.053">Does</a>  that mean then that if the mayor wants to, you know, remove an employee for X reason, and they make the notification, say today, then that person cannot be removed or doesn't have to be removed until, you know, November 3rd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=264.981">So</a>  what happens then maybe in the case of, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=270.304">Well,</a>  I suppose in any case, really, if you're leaving of your own accord, you're giving two weeks notice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=279.609">But</a>  if you're being told to go for whatever reason, they generally want you out the door quickly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=287.353">So</a>  does that mean then that if the mayor is seeking the dismissal of whomever, that they don't have to go for 30 days? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=300.095">Seems</a>  a bit strange.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=303.076">So,</a>  Anthony or Marilyn, can you answer that?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=314.68">Sorry,</a>  just trying to unmute myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=317.261">So,</a>  reading the section, it does say that the mayor will <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=324.519">submit</a>  the notice of removal to the city clerk and that the actual removal will happen within 30 days of the submission of that document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=332.642">So</a>  that is how that reads. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=338.964">So</a>  I don't really have anything else to add to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=341.865">That's</a>  what that section says.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=344.446">So</a>  they can be gone that day if she wants them gone that day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=350.419">you</a>  know, or do they have 30 days where they can stay employed?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=354.962">I</a>  don't know if I'm making myself clear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=359.005">I</a>  think it's typical of any <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=363.949">situation</a>  of employee with employee that, you know, if you feel as though you need to terminate that employee and it has to be done today, because that's generally the threshold that you do it on when you've made that decision, and then that's it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=381.164">You</a>  know, that day is good enough for anybody else.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=385.691">Well,</a>  I guess I think, Eunice, your question is, under this provision, if the mayor dismisses a city officer or department head, do they stay in the job for 30 days?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=396.858">Right,</a>  or... That's the question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=399.2">If</a>  she wants them gone today, are they... Can she do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=403.563">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=404.223">So,</a>  Anthony and Marilyn, does this mean that the person has to stay or gets to stay on the job for another month?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=411.922">Well,</a>  there is this opportunity for the individual to reply to the statement and whether the mayor chooses to have a hearing or not, which is often available, that has to be scheduled and that takes time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=435.175">So,</a>  you've got this interim, you have this interim event <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=441.567">if</a>  the person wants to reply to the mayor's statement of removal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=448.611">You</a>  have to account for that time too.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=452.493">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=455.914">Ron,</a>  did you have a comment about this?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=461.637">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=461.977">I</a>  think <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=465.522">I</a>  don't know how much detail we want to put into it, but I think there has to be case by case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=469.866">There'll</a>  be a case where someone has to leave that second, and there'll be a case where there's a process involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=475.23">The</a>  question I was having is if we're talking about union employees, does that change the whole ballgame in terms of this article?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=487.18">No,</a>  because unions have a grievance and removal procedure in their contracts.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=494.616">And</a>  this applies to a city officer or head of a city department appointed by the mayor, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=501.641">So</a>  I don't think it applies to anybody else.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=505.683">The</a>  union contract would trump, you know, to the extent that someone are examining the union contract would trump this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=511.327">You'd</a>  have to follow the grievance procedures in the contract.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=516.03">Maury?</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=521.408">Yeah,</a>  I'm thinking, okay, I just heard it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=524.05">I</a>  think it just comes down to that the mayor is chief executive of the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=531.834">And</a>  just like in any business or anything else that if the mayor has deemed or the chief executive or the owner of any business that this person can no longer be here for whatever, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=547.862">whatever</a>  the situation is that, okay, we're going to terminate your employment right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=553.444">If</a>  you feel as though you have the grievance to come back on us and everything else, fine, so be it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=560.146">But</a>  at this point, the mayor should be allowed to have that leniency to make that decision.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=570.85">Excuse</a>  me, but I don't think that this is an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=576.874">If</a>  the mayor decides, you know, to terminate someone for whatever reason or, you know, there's a mutual separation, I think this is more about the formal part of their job, you know, like their health benefits and, you know, like, you know, if somebody needed to be gone on the day, they can be suspended, you know what I mean? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=602.079">And</a>  at the end of the month, they, you know, they stop being <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=607.028">you</a>  know, a city employee, it's basically just giving, you know, kind of a grace period, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=616.871">But</a>  if somebody needs to be, you know, removed from the premises, the mayor has the power to do that, you know, just that their, you know, their employment would end at the end of the month, you know, their, you know, their health insurance and, you know, whatever goes along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=636.005">with</a>  being a city employee.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=637.446">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=639.688">Anthony</a>  Wilson, did you have something to add?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=643.265">Yes,</a>  I'm just I was just going back to my notes and I don't exactly remember the conversation that the committee had, but just from my notes reflected when the committee discussed this, we went through sort of the 3 different levels of oversight of the mayor in terms of these types of terminations or removals of officers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=660.811">And</a>  some communities have it where the city council has to confirm a removal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=666.813">Uh,</a>  some have it where the city council is basically what what this provision is was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=671.236">That</a>  they have an opportunity to be notified of the removal and then some. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=675.059">Charters</a>  don't have this language at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=676.921">I</a>  believe when the committee discussed this, it shows this middle option is sort of a middle ground is keeping the council in the loop, but still giving the sort of not infringing on the mayor's authority. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=689.45">That</a>  was that sort of my memory from my notes.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=695.243">That</a>  sounds like what we discussed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=700.771">So,</a>  Eunice, do you feel like your question has been answered or is there anything? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=706.559">I</a>  think I get it now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=707.82">So,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=709.943">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=711.045">Ron?</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=713.883">Yeah,</a>  not on this subject, but I just want to say before we get too deep into this, I want to, you know, recognize you, Milva, for the leadership that you've shown to produce this document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=723.57">I'd</a>  be remiss if I didn't say that Jean's revision that she sent out today was not super helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=730.376">But</a>  my question to the Collins Center and to whoever, I'd like to get an understanding of how this is being presented. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=737.112">to</a>  the City Council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=737.992">Are</a>  we just sending the document? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=739.373">Are</a>  we highlighting the changes in a presentation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=743.714">And</a>  my big question for the Collins Center, having done this before, is this going to be an all-or-nothing type of vote, or is there a way that we can break up these articles? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=756.358">So</a>  if I agree with <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=758.291">ward</a>  representation but I don't agree with the mayor having four years do I have to say no to the whole charter or do we structure it so that we're voting on each article at a time to give us more you know there'll be pieces of a full charter that I'm not going to like and I have to just weigh that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=776.972">So</a>  that's my question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=778.492">Is</a>  there a way, what do most cities and towns do? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=781.613">Is</a>  it all at once, all in? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=784.614">Or</a>  is it, well, I like the mayor's four years, but I don't like Ward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=788.395">Is</a>  that going to be part of this vote for the people?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=796.983">Okay,</a>  Phyllis has a question, but I'm... Ron, if I hear your question correctly... I have a question for Ron.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=804.067">Okay,</a>  go ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=805.508">Didn't</a>  we already vote on all of this?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=807.129">No,</a>  I think he's using... I'm talking about the vote, Phyllis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=810.11">When</a>  it goes on the ballot, I go on the ballot and I see... It's the whole vote.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=815.413">I</a>  mean, it has to go through the Mayor, the City Council and the State House first, but providing when it gets to the ballot, that's your question.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=825.657">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=826.398">Will</a>  people be able to vote on... I was in and out, so thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=830.719">Okay,</a>  so Anthony or Marilyn, when these questions get on the ballot, what's usually the structure?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=842.455">I'll</a>  start Marilyn feel free to sort of jump in here with your sort of vast knowledge here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=847.828">If</a>  memory serves, I believe that this committee was created. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=852.762">pursuant</a>  to mayoral order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=854.363">So</a>  my understanding, and the administration can give you more thorough direction, is that this report from this committee will actually go to the mayor, and the mayor can review it and make whatever changes she deems necessary, if she deems any necessary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=874.661">And</a>  then it is, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=876.683">For</a>  the mayor to submit this to the city council as a special legislation, if the city, when the city council considers it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=886.789">The</a>  city council can also make whatever changes to whatever portions of the proposal that it, it deems necessary. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=894.233">Again,</a>  assume that the mayor agrees with those changes and the council adopts them, then it will go to the legislature. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=902.197">I</a>  don't believe, or at least my last reading of it, there's no provision in here where it says that some communities have a provision that says that the legislature has to make an up or down vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=912.422">My</a>  reading of this doesn't, it currently doesn't have that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=916.704">The</a>  city council or the mayor, I guess, in the internal process at the, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=922.207">City</a>  level could add that provision during their reviews, but assuming it goes to the legislature as is, the legislature could say, we have concerns about this, or we have concerns about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=934.272">They</a>  usually communicate that back to the city through the clerk's office or the law department, and then there can be modifications there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=942.016">And</a>  then if the council, the legislature adopts, then it will come back to appear on the ballot for Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=948.899">Marilyn,</a>  if I butchered any of that, please correct me.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=954.156">Well,</a>  the council actually votes on the document as a whole. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=960.298">They</a>  can't, it's not a menu kind of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=965.599">And</a>  the council vote, and if the council has made changes that the mayor doesn't like, she doesn't have veto authority, but it can't go to the legislature without the mayor's approval. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=980.423">That's</a>  in the constitution. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=982.172">And</a>  when it appears on the municipal election ballot, the voter is seeing, is accepting everything that's in the document or nothing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=991.955">All</a>  or nothing vote.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=993.456">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=995.296">Ron,</a>  does that answer your question?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=997.937">I</a>  just want to follow up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=999.177">I</a>  mean, I understand that the city council and the mayor will have opportunities to amend it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1003.539">The</a>  voter doesn't have that opportunity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1007.12">My</a>  question is that if, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1011.325">If</a>  we want this thing to pass and somebody didn't vote for it because it had, you know, the mere four and I wanted two, but I loved everything else on there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1021.464">That's</a>  kind of counterproductive in my mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1023.305">The</a>  other thing too is I know that the city council was working on three amendments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1027.628">So</a>  I know that as a city, we can file amendments at any point, not just a full chart. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1034.152">I</a>  mean, we can, so I guess what I'm thinking is the best thing is to break it up by article so that people get to vote up or down each one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1043.678">And</a>  I, I'm just the mechanism that city council was using to get amendments through so they would be on the ballot with three separate amendments that were not a full charter so I know we can amend the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1055.431">I</a>  just, I'm just trying to get my head around somebody who says, you know, they want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1061.404">They</a>  want the mayor to have four years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1063.625">There's</a>  no way I'm voting for this, but yet I really like this, and I like this, and I like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1068.848">So</a>  that's a no vote, even though they only didn't like 10% of what was in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1074.772">So</a>  that's what my concern is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1076.453">It's</a>  such a good document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1078.334">The</a>  city council has a chance to amend and adjust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1081.095">The</a>  mayor has a chance to amend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1083.076">The</a>  voter doesn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1084.177">The</a>  voter has to take it all the way unless we give them another option. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1087.379">That's</a>  the basis of my question.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1090.461">Thanks,</a>  Ron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1093.339">I</a>  think, I mean, I don't know if Anthony or Marilyn wants to speak to this, but I'm not sure that we have the, that's in our power. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1101.343">I</a>  mean, you know, our task was to review the charter and create a report and that's what we've done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1107.406">But</a>  Anthony or Marilyn, is there any way we can look at some of what Ron is talking about?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1117.78">If</a>  I understand it correctly, you're talking about breaking up, I guess, the various articles into their own pieces of legislation to be voted on by the constituencies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1128.945">Am</a>  I hearing that correctly?</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1131.266">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1132.206">I</a>  guess I'm trying to find a distinction, Anthony, between the amendment process of an existing charter versus the charter that we've created, which is just a series of amendments, if you break it down. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1143.991">I'm</a>  just trying to give a voter the chance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1146.472">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1148.232">This</a>  document is not a series of amendments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1150.554">It's</a>  a brand new charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1152.775">One</a>  of the stuff that's addressed by some of, by the plan H.R. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1158.438">you</a>  have now.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1161.68">We're</a>  all in, we're all in or not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1166.844">Well,</a>  this is a yes or no on the whole thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1169.165">And</a>  if I don't like 10% of it, I have to vote no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1174.722">that</a>  that's the usual process yes if you okay so Mary let me ask you this follow-up question if if we wanted to only make the mayor four years the process would be we create an amendment to the existing charter yes or no vote okay yes or no vote all right so that's six years out okay got it thank you um okay um maury</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1201.817">We</a>  have to get back to Maury's motion and officially adopt a vote on this.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1205.499">I'd</a>  like to hop in a little bit because I'm going to call upon Eunice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1211.342">Are</a>  you out there, Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1214.263">She's</a>  right here, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1216.864">The</a>  city council is going to review our charter commission <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1223.18">Recommendations</a>  tomorrow night or next week?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1227.521">Next</a>  Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1229.522">What</a>  they've done is the governance committee, which is chaired by Councilor Justin Tseng, and there's four or five others on them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1239.885">I</a>  think Zach is, and I can't remember who else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1243.546">But</a>  as part of their agenda, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1249.516">the</a>  City Council's agenda for this two-year term has been creating a charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1255.533">And</a>  so, um, they've talked about it on and off for the past, you know, eight or nine months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1261.895">And,</a>  um, now I guess they're finally getting started on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1266.076">So,</a>  um, they are, the governance committee, um, is meeting, um, Wednesday night, October 9th at seven o'clock, and they are going to begin discussing a timeline to craft their own charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1281.481">and</a>  they will consider the report that we are about to submit.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1287.405">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1287.966">I</a>  was a little confused of what that meant. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1290.808">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1291.289">Ron,</a>  I agree with what you're saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1294.171">There's</a>  a lot of issues that you may want this and you may want that, but this isn't a line item. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1303.902">referendum</a>  to make it easy to say that this is what we're recommending. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1308.925">This</a>  is what we're recommending as a committee and that we've all agreed upon for the last two and a half years and got to this conclusion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1319.252">So</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1320.962">You</a>  know, so be it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1322.723">If</a>  the mayor or the city council wants to kind of shred it up a little bit, that's their prerogative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1330.189">But</a>  we should also have the opportunity to stand behind our work for the last two and a half years against people that have just started, that have never been in the city in the last two years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1342.238">So</a>  I'm going to leave it at that.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1345.123">All</a>  right, thanks, Maury.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1346.343">Okay,</a>  so now- I do have a question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1350.144">Okay,</a>  Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1352.545">Just</a>  in kind of what we're submitting, you know, along the line, the call-in center has, you know, pretty much given their opinion on our work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1369.43">And,</a>  you know, sometimes they've cautioned us about not putting something in <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1374.135">giving</a>  us an explanation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1377.658">Is</a>  that going to be, are their recommendations and their cautions going to be submitted along with our draft charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1390.287">I</a>  just don't want all that information to be lost for the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1397.903">And</a>  I guess that's my question in a nutshell. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1402.868">What</a>  happens to the recommendations that the call-in center made about our work?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1410.319">So</a>  what I sent out about a week ago was the final report, which so when we submit, we will submit the draft charter will be part of that final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1423.671">So</a>  whatever was in the final report currently is what we would submit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1428.355">So</a>  if you had something that you thought we should add, I mean, did you have a chance to look at it?</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1435.293">Yes,</a>  I did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1435.873">Okay,</a>  so there are a number of things that the calling center recommended that we not include in our charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1445.175">And</a>  that's, you know, valuable information that, you know, that I think should be passed along to the city council as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1453.476">So,</a>  you know, they can make kind of, you know, either, you know, they can have all the information they need to kind of, you know, do whatever, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1464.591">due</a>  diligence that they're going to do with the document we give them, you know? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1470.895">Or</a>  are they going to, again, you know, ask the Collins Center to review what they come up with? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1479.901">Do</a>  you know what I'm... Yeah, yeah, I hear you.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1482.783">Jean,</a>  did you want to say something about this?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1485.225">Anthony,</a>  we're going to include all the memos that we received from the Collins Center as appendices in the report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1494.856">All</a>  the memos from the Collins Center will be in the report.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1499.542">I</a>  think maybe, Anthony, are you talking about certain things that our committee voted to include that the Collins Center said, well, this isn't in like, for instance, the ethics commission and the financial reporting or the school committee clerk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1514.633">If</a>  you're talking about things like that, I guess I would ask Anthony or Marilyn, when committees write their final reports, is that the kind of information that they generally include?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1534.572">Marilyn,</a>  do you want to do you want to go first? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1539.537">The</a>  short answer is no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1542.739">We</a>  provided the information to the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1544.881">It</a>  was it was what we thought needed to be brought to the committee's attention. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1552.348">And</a>  if the committee didn't follow it, it's. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1557.633">That</a>  belongs to the committee, it doesn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1562.28">it's</a>  not necessarily that it would be passed on.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1567.384">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1567.865">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1568.245">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1570.326">Um,</a>  okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1571.728">So</a>  Anthony, do you, do you have anything else you want to say?</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1575.711">Anthony</a>  Andrea, is that, uh, I'm just, I'm, I'm just trying to understand what the motion is on the floor now to accept the entirety of the charter and <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1591.835">and</a>  kind of say, I agree to this whole document?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1595.338">So</a>  that would be, so what I would like to do is yes, the answer to that is yes for the charter, the draft charter portion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1604.585">And</a>  then once we get that done, we'll look at the final report part and see if anybody has anything that they feel should be changed or added to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1614.154">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1615.074">So</a>  Maury and Eunice, did you have anything to say before we go ahead with that vote?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1621.576">No,</a>  I just want to move ahead with the motion that I put. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1624.037">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1624.657">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1625.097">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1627.698">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1628.618">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1629.218">I</a>  had one question, something that came up and sorry to bringing it up now, but something crossed my mind. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1638.34">We</a>  talk about posting meetings and so forth. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1643.123">And</a>  I know that there's a section on the mass.gov website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1647.886">Let</a>  me see if I can, I had it up here a second ago. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1651.808">It</a>  shows official notice posting locations for public bodies. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1657.552">So</a>  it's, you can either be a physical posting community, which is what we are, which basically, and Anthony or Marilyn can correct me, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1666.457">But</a>  from what I understand, that basically means that a meeting is officially posted if it's tacked to the bulletin board outside of the city clerk's office, and then any other way that we choose to post it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1681.0">Other</a>  communities, they have other ways of posting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1685.361">Some</a>  of them put things in a binder or something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1689.622">Most</a>  communities now in the 21st century post their meetings to the website, and when it's officially on the website, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1696.885">The</a>  meeting is officially posted, so I'm wondering. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1702.384">you</a>  know, and you have to designate with the state, with mass.gov, if you're a, you know, physical posting community, or if you are like a website posting community, is that something that would go in the charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1721.339">And</a>  if we were to be a website posting community, then does that mean that <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1730.768">If</a>  there's a meeting posted for a certain date and time, and for whatever reason, the meeting needs to change, and I'm specifically talking about an instance that came up a couple of winters ago, a school committee meeting was due to be held on a Monday evening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1751.624">It</a>  snowed like crazy that afternoon they closed city hall at 3 o'clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1756.329">I</a>  emailed the vice chair of the school committee and I said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1760.693">Is</a>  the school committee meeting just going to be held on zoom tonight? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1764.376">Um,</a>  you know, because obviously city hall is closing early and so forth and I was told ideally that would be great, but that, you know, we couldn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1775.887">change</a>  that because of open meeting law regulations, because we're a physical posting city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1783.828">And</a>  since City Hall is already closed, can't tax something on the bulletin board to make a change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1789.169">So</a>  I'm wondering if how we designate what kind of a posting city we are, does that go in the charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1800.411">Long</a>  way of getting to it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1802.792">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1804.268">But</a>  so my, oh, so my understanding of that is that you couldn't, I think the state law that allows the posting, it provides 2 different ways. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1812.611">You</a>  can do the continue with the posting to some physical bulletin board, or you can designate your website to be your meeting posting location. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1819.594">The</a>  chief executive of the community has to submit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1824.937">A</a>  form would be sort of 2 form, but it's basically a notice to the state saying we are opting into posting on our electronic website. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1832.423">And</a>  here is the basically the URL and that is how that process is laid out.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1837.788">Okay,</a>  so it doesn't go in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1840.55">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1841.731">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1843.692">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1844.133">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1844.813">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1845.274">Now</a>  we are going to go ahead with. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1848.196">Well,</a>  his motion, which anybody want to officially 2nd that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1853.182">that</a>  we're gonna vote on the charter document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1857.364">I</a>  second. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1858.665">Okay,</a>  so the question is, do we accept this draft charter as written to be put into our final report? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1872.533">Okay,</a>  Eunice.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1874.694">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1877.155">Ron.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1879.117">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1881.038">Phyllis.</a> </p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1882.631">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1883.412">Jean.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1884.613">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1885.414">Danielle.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1888.056">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1889.897">Maury.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1890.978">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1892.46">Anthony</a>  Andreottola.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1894.301">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1898.425">And</a>  me, I'm yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1900.506">I</a>  think that's everybody who's here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1903.269">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1903.929">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1904.27">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1905.07">You're</a>  the confetti. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1906.892">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1907.552">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1908.853">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1909.374">Now</a>  we're. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1911.548">Now</a>  we are going to go to the final report, which hopefully you all had a chance to read. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1916.05">Thanks,</a>  Francis, for the confidence.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1923.853">I've</a>  had a chance to review it, and I hope everybody else has. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1926.674">I'll</a>  make a motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1928.575">Well,</a>  first, I just want to ask if anybody has any changes or additions they want to make. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1933.237">Who's</a>  that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1934.798">Eunice.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1935.458">Not</a>  surprisingly, I do.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1937.439">Oh,</a>  Christ.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1941.728">A</a>  few small things, and then I would suggest, and I can put the text that I've created in the draft, but I suggest writing, including a section, and this all goes into the community engagement summary about public meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1963.784">What</a>  page is that on, Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1967.066">Do</a>  you want me to share my screen? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1970.542">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1971.743">And</a>  meanwhile, let me put the text that I have in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1976.249">All</a>  right, you should be able to share, Jane.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1978.872">OK,</a>  thanks, Jane. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1998.33">I'm</a>  just trying to pull it up.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=1999.411">Sorry,</a>  it's OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2001.091">Yeah,</a>  and I'm trying to find a. See.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2038.02">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2041.683">So</a>  on the community engagement? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2044.905">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2048.468">We</a>  have this on public hearings here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2050.969">No,</a>  this is a section I suggest on public meetings and I'm going to pop the text into. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2061.717">Oh,</a>  I hate working with my laptop.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2069.89">Back</a>  to zoom how's what are public meeting separate from public hearings public meetings are like, basically what we're doing now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2082.462">Okay,</a>  I see.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2086.125">Let</a>  me see if I can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2088.406">So</a>  basically our meetings and subcommittee meetings, right?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2091.97">So</a>  I put in and the reason I suggest this is because. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2098.097">We've</a>  all heard on any particular topics that comes up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2102.777">you</a>  know, at the city council or the school committee or whatever, and people find out about it and they feel like, you know, that was done under the dark of night. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2112.845">Nobody</a>  ever told me about that or how come we didn't know about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2117.749">And</a>  this is, you know, um, my suggestion of, um, putting something in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2124.655">And</a>  I went and I counted up how many meetings we actually held. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2130.0">And</a>  how many of them were our regular Thursday evening meetings versus subcommittee meetings? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2137.207">And</a>  the fact that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2139.789">You</a>  know, all of them are on zoom all of them on the city calendar. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2143.153">Basically,</a>  we did this with full transparency. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2147.923">And,</a>  you know, I think it will say to people, you know, you had plenty of opportunity to participate in this process, 58 meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2157.97">Plenty</a>  of opportunity and and that's something that I would like to see and I suggest that include the focus groups units. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2167.493">Uh,</a>  no, that's separate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2170.296">No,</a>  that's that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2171.817">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2172.378">That's</a>  up the ice cream. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2173.459">So</a>  all that stuff went into different. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2175.261">These</a>  are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2176.682">You</a>  know, Thursday meetings, we had some extra Thursday meetings, you know, where we doubled up a few months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2183.528">And,</a>  yeah, all of the subcommittee meetings that we had. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2187.511">You</a>  know, would representation, the preamble group, we really have 30 subcommittee meetings.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2194.457">We</a>  associate a total. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2197.299">So,</a>  I guess we did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2198.359">So,</a>  when you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2201.962">Yeah,</a>  you're suggesting including, even though those were just our meetings, they were all open to the public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2206.949">So</a>  you're suggesting adding these to the public engagement section, making the point that this was part of the public outreach of the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2216.703">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2217.083">I</a>  mean, the fact that all our meetings were open to the public and we have the public attending.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2221.525">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2221.905">And</a>  if, you know, maybe somebody was interested in the elections process, but not interested in the school committee, you know, they could have logged on or watched on TV or watch the instant replay or whatever of whatever topic, you know, of interest, um, as well as our, you know, once a month, Thursday meetings where we, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2244.836">Took</a>  votes and things like that, so it's part of to be the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2250.319">Transparency</a>  and heading off that, you know, we did all of this open and above board. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2256.202">People</a>  had a chance to participate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2257.683">They</a>  just didn't.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2259.844">Okay,</a>  so you want to basically. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2264.526">suggest</a>  that we add this to the charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2268.727">Does</a>  anybody have any thoughts about this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2270.347">Does</a>  anybody have any? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2271.368">I</a>  make a motion to do so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2273.088">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2273.868">Does</a>  anybody want to have any?</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2275.689">Yeah,</a>  I'd like to say something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2279.709">If</a>  you would add that, it makes the appearance that there was a lot of community participation, that they had all these meetings, when in reality, they were sparsely <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2292.317">or</a>  not attended at all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2293.938">I</a>  don't think it, it's not being transparent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2298.201">It's</a>  actually misrepresenting, you know, that yeah, that they were open to the public, but you're going to put that they were open to the public, but the public didn't come. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2308.049">I</a>  mean, it, it, it kind of the message is that, you know, this was like a, a community, you know, a community driven, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2320.91">process,</a>  and it was, but it wasn't, you know, no one took advantage of it, or very few people did.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2331.584">Okay,</a>  I didn't see who raised their hand first, so I'm just gonna go to the first person on my screen, Ron.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2340.012">Yeah,</a>  with all due respect, I couldn't disagree with Anthony more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2344.054">Of</a>  course you don't disagree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2347.797">But</a>  it's the truth.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2349.718">Okay,</a>  go ahead, Ron.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2353.34">The</a>  fact is that this committee made available everything that we do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2358.868">Whether</a>  people didn't take advantage of it is not on us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2361.709">It's</a>  on the people who chose not to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2364.33">And</a>  we have no measure for how many people went on Zoom and looked up recorded issues as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2371.312">So</a>  I think putting negative in here would just be the wrong thing to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2376.494">We</a>  gave opportunity to make this as public as possible, and I totally disagree with what was just said.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2383.256">I'd</a>  like to respond, please. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2384.936">Yeah,</a>  go ahead, Ian. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2385.917">I</a>  do have a right to respond. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2387.947">That</a>  is not what I said, Ron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2389.828">Please</a>  don't misinterpret my words. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2391.569">My</a>  words were not to include a negative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2394.59">I'm</a>  saying that not to include a message that this was a large community participatory events because they weren't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2405.895">And</a>  it would be misleading to communicate that in our report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2411.912">We</a>  don't want to misrepresent what we did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2414.876">We</a>  did it openly and people chose not to participate in large numbers. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2421.185">Does</a>  that need to be in our report? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2423.929">No,</a>  but we shouldn't go <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2426.598">put</a>  in our report that we had this huge, you know, 50 some odd meetings that were open to the public to misrepresent what actually occurred. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2439.386">What</a>  occurred was that work did happen, it was available for people, and very few community members participated.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2450.185">okay</a>  that's the truth that's the reality that's not being that's not being negative okay can phyllis can you speak phyllis and then i'm going to go to maury and then danielle go ahead phyllis uh anthony i think you're misunderstanding this this is very kindly i would like you to listen okay so i'm going to say i think this is a good statement i don't think it's negative in any way shape or form this is factual these are the meetings that we held <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2480.442">We</a>  invited people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2481.683">Whether</a>  they came or not is not a point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2483.964">I</a>  think this tells, if anyone picks this up and read it, they could say, oh, they did a lot of work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2489.807">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2490.027">It</a>  wasn't just something that was done in, someone said, in the dark of the night or something like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2495.13">I</a>  think it's important for people to know how seriously we took this and that we spent the time and we put in the time to do this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2503.094">I</a>  see it in no way as being in any way, shape, or form negative in any sense of the manner.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2510.218">If</a>  people are going to put words in my mouth and say things that are inaccurate, I have the responsibility to respond. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2523.207">Just</a>  as we did, excuse me, I'd like to respond.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2527.85">Just</a>  for a minute, Anthony, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2530.172">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2531.333">In</a>  the fact of the last thing that we voted on, the ethics, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2537.368">We</a>  didn't communicate with the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2540.37">In</a>  the beginning of this process, we engaged with community members, politicians, anybody that would talk to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2549.594">We</a>  did a lot of outreach and talked to a lot of people about things before we voted, before we formulated things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2557.178">But</a>  as the time went on, we held meetings, they weren't attended by people, we didn't get feedback, we didn't seek feedback from community members or our government officials. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2569.682">So</a>  to present ourselves is that we did this and just, you know what, just we're going to, you're going to vote and you're going to put it in and go right ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2587.726">I'm</a>  all done.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2589.748">Okay,</a>  thanks for that, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2591.729">Danielle,</a>  I think Maury was next, and then Danielle.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2596.252">Anthony,</a>  this isn't an attack on you, but let's just talk about this for a second.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2602.936">Let's</a>  not even talk about me.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2604.237">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2604.597">Come</a>  on, come on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2606.018">We've</a>  done this for how long? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2608.92">You</a>  and I sat there, we talked about how many committee individual meetings- Maury, this is not about me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2616.965">I</a>  didn't.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2617.927">Yeah,</a>  let's just focus on the proposal.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2622.172">I'm</a>  not saying it is, but what we have to hear is we did everything that's out there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2629.921">We</a>  did it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2630.882">Whether</a>  people got involved in it or whether they didn't, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2634.907">That's</a>  their prerogative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2636.488">It's</a>  not what we were charged to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2639.609">And</a>  what we were charged to do, we've done it over and above, as far as I'm concerned. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2645.631">And</a>  Anthony, you know me as well as anybody else does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2652.353">We've</a>  done a good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2653.593">You've</a>  done a great job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2654.774">And</a>  everybody in this committee have done a good job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2660.457">How</a>  much can you take it that people don't want to get involved in it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2664.762">That's</a>  not our problem.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2667.545">OK,</a>  thanks, Maury.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2668.907">I</a>  second the motion.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2670.369">I</a>  just want to let Danielle make her comment.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2676.8">Yeah,</a>  I do appreciate these comments, because I mean, I hear what you're saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2683.863">It</a>  sounds like actually you guys are kind of saying the same thing, where we presented what we could control, which was that we made as much effort to engage the public as we could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2696.049">And</a>  I think it's important to have it in here, because <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2700.131">not</a>  only to show this is what we did, but also for the future, when people do this again, they know how much to engage the community or how many attempts to engage the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2708.697">So</a>  that when people say about this, about our work, we didn't know this was happening, we couldn't do this, both they can see that what we are, the attempts that we made, and they can see when this happens again, I'll have these other opportunities to participate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2721.567">That's</a>  a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2723.348">Just</a>  a presentation of facts, like these are the things we did, this is what we could control, and we did what we could control.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2729.987">That's</a>  a, that's a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2731.791">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2732.352">I</a>  do want to vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2735.136">But</a>  can I put my editor hat on for a minute, Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2738.057">Are</a>  you okay with that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2739.537">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2739.917">I</a>  mean, this was a draft. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2741.718">I</a>  mean, you can, you know, tweak it as needed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2744.959">I'm</a>  just in the streamlined mindset, and I would like to go from various components of a charter to we held 30 subcommittee meetings, just because that other information is in other parts of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2761.643">Well,</a>  the Collins Center is in other parts of the final report, and I don't necessarily think we need to say that they were the first Thursday of the month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2770.652">That's</a>  just, and then it just tightens it up.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2773.274">I'm</a>  probably okay with what you're saying, but I just want to be clear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2776.558">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2777.679">So,</a>  well, Jean just did it, so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2781.422">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2783.572">So</a>  during the span of 22 months, we have 58, 28, 30 subcommittee meeting to do deeper dives.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2795.501">It</a>  just tightens it up a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2797.483">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2798.003">Yeah,</a>  I'm good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2799.384">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2800.085">So</a>  we're going to vote on whether to add this to this community engagement section of the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2808.852">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2812.002">Eunice?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2812.902">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2815.703">Well,</a>  this is where I can't see everybody, so I'm going to try to remember everybody's name. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2819.805">Phyllis?</a> </p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2820.545">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2868.653">Yeah,</a>  I just have two small ones. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2872.334">Jean,</a>  can you scroll back up to the top of community engagement, please? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2880.944">Where</a>  it says in the second paragraph, while we had a limited budget for community engagement, we accomplished a lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2889.908">My</a>  suggestion would be, while we had a limited budget for community engagement and no community newspaper to turn to, we accomplished a lot.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2906.213">We</a>  could add that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2907.013">I</a>  mean, how do people feel about that?</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2920.401">It's</a>  fine with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2921.202">I</a>  don't have a strong objection.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2926.345">Anybody?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2926.745">Maury.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2933.897">I</a>  mean, what is this doing for? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2935.539">Why</a>  are we going through this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2938.102">I</a>  don't think it means anything to what we're trying to do in the big picture of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2946.213">We've</a>  had meetings upon meetings and subcommittees <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2951.849">It's</a>  more than the whole project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2954.351">I</a>  don't want to go through this anymore.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2956.513">I'm</a>  going to vote no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2957.034">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2957.775">This</a>  is just one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2958.655">I</a>  vote no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2961.038">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2961.358">So</a>  do we want to vote? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2963.22">So</a>  I guess we're going to vote on whether to add this little line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2966.323">But</a>  Jamie, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2968.064">Put</a>  the I in utilize. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2969.406">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2972.408">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2973.69">Maury,</a>  let me just say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2977.647">Are</a>  there any other no votes besides Maury? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2980.37">Does</a>  anybody else object to adding this to the final report?</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2986.315">I'm</a>  apathetic. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2987.416">I'm</a>  going to abstain. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2988.497">I</a>  really.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2989.518">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2990.819">I</a>  think that then we're just going to add it in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2995.584">Good.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2996.465">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2997.45">Anybody</a>  else, any other changes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=2999.352">Eunice,</a>  did you have anything else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3000.974">I</a>  mean, I'm clearly pissing people off, so I won't bother. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3003.276">No,</a>  you're not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3004.297">It's</a>  okay, Eunice, if you have something else.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3006.459">Eunice,</a>  you are not pissing me off, dear, at all.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3011.404">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3012.785">Under</a>  the listening sessions, I would just suggest adding that we also had one with ASL interpreters. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3021.653">That's</a>  a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3023.555">That's</a>  where we talked about the Spanish and Haitian Creole part. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3027.598">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3030.301">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3030.761">That's</a>  a good addition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3033.383">Jean,</a>  you'll add that in, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3035.365">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3036.125">Happened</a>  to be the one that I was the note taker for.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3046.126">And</a>  then under the interviews of elected and city leaders, I would just add that we also interviewed the current and immediate past superintendent of schools.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3057.212">Yeah,</a>  did that not get in there? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3058.832">I</a>  don't think so.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3060.013">The</a>  assistant superintendent too also, was he interviewed or did he just come to our meeting, Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3067.801">I</a>  think maybe he just came to our meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3070.064">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3070.384">Yeah,</a>  I don't remember that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3071.845">Yeah,</a>  we just said, we said city officials, but we could.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3075.89">Yeah,</a>  but I just like, you know, highlighting that, you know, it's such a, I think that's a good point.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3083.017">I</a>  agree with that, but just because the superintendent is yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3089.29">Current</a>  and former superintendents? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3091.852">I</a>  think Belson was interviewed too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3093.794">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3094.915">The</a>  school committee subcommittee did that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3097.538">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3097.798">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3101.982">If</a>  they were included in the sixth, we should change that number, right?</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3106.863">I</a>  don't think they were, were they counted in that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3109.326">They're</a>  really not city officials, so I'm glad we're pointing them out.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3113.31">Jean,</a>  when you wrote this section, did you include them in the six? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3116.413">I</a>  don't remember, so I'll double check. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3118.475">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3121.077">I</a>  know under the interview section, if you were trying to, when you listed Alicia Hunt and an assortment of others, didn't you, I think Adam Hurtubise was also interviewed?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3134.463">Yes,</a>  Adam Hurtubise, Alicia Hunt, also Nina Nazarian.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3138.025">And</a>  Melissa Ripley, who was the intelligence person at the time.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3142.006">Yeah,</a>  we sort of interviewed her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3144.087">We</a>  had an email exchange.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3148.716">And</a>  would it be worth it to include? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3152.22">Yeah,</a>  put Melissa Ripley there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3154.323">Yeah,</a>  and Adam Hernandez.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3156.685">Oh,</a>  yeah, that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3157.726">Is</a>  that the right spelling? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3160.81">Yes,</a>  that's right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3164.234">Thank</a>  you, Eunice, for paying attention to this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3172.646">I</a>  don't know how you spell that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3174.547">You'll</a>  check that later, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3176.067">I'll</a>  check it, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3177.568">I</a>  think it's H-U-R-T-I-B-U. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3181.229">You're</a>  his neighbor, don't you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3182.99">I</a>  know, he is my neighbor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3184.01">Yeah,</a>  but that's okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3185.691">We</a>  can double check that later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3187.252">We'll</a>  make sure that's right.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3190.633">In</a>  the appendix, are you listing the subcommittees that we had?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3196.955">We</a>  didn't know that, but that's a good, I think that would be a worthwhile addition.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3205.302">And</a>  the last suggestion that I had, and then I'll keep quiet is, um, you know, we go, we go through under here with the recommendations and, you know, we have each article, um, you know, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, you know, uh, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3223.45">I</a>  just have this suggestion that we add in, because people are going to look through that and wonder, where's articles 1, 5, and 10? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3232.617">Yeah,</a>  that's true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3234.479">I</a>  would just add each of those three and state that just a line or two of what they are and based upon, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3248.69">Best</a>  practices in a charter, these will be components of our.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3253.613">Proposed</a>  charter or something, so you're talking about under the sort of major recommendation sections. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3259.936">Yeah,</a>  I mean, we have articles.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3262.517">You</a>  know, 2, 3, 4, 6, you know, all the rest of them and we're reading that would be like, well, where's 1, 5 and 10.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3270.161">Well,</a>  I mean, the reason they're not there is because we didn't, there weren't, you know, that section just sort of pulls out the major recommendations that we're making in the charter, but in those sections are, didn't have any really sort of recommendations of note. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3284.65">That's</a>  why we didn't do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3286.852">But</a>  the major recommendation is to add that section. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3290.955">To</a>  have a new modernized charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3292.576">Yeah,</a>  that's in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3296.788">Yeah,</a>  I'm just trying to think of how we would do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3306.561">So</a>  Eunice, can you just explain where are you suggesting we?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3312.021">Note</a>  this not in the summary, but when you're going right down, you know, when you have so and so you go article to legislative branch recommendations and then you have.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3323.953">You</a>  know, so we would say you skipped over article 1, so we would say article 1 incorporation short title definitions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3333.523">And</a>  just leave it blank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3335.86">after</a>  that?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3336.84">Is</a>  that how you envision it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3339.061">It's</a>  been recommended. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3343.363">This</a>  article, this section is best practice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3350.706">Adding</a>  this section is best practice for a modern charter or something to that effect. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3356.088">Am</a>  I making sense? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3358.229">And</a>  then the same for 5 and 10. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3366.155">a</a>  description of what that particular article does, and that it's a best practice to- To have the Senate charter.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3376.401">What</a>  do people think about that idea?</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3378.742">Excuse</a>  me.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3380.023">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3382.144">When</a>  I was writing it, I felt like it wasn't clear why we were leaving those sections out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3387.147">So</a>  to me, I did think of what you're saying, Eunice.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3391.81">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3393.051">I</a>  don't want to use the word lopsided, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3395.729">left-sided.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3396.229">It</a>  could just be a short summary of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3400.131">We</a>  added this section, like you said, and it includes definitions or.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3406.373">Okay,</a>  Maury, do you have?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3408.294">I'm</a>  just confused by which subcommittee meeting that all of this was held in.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3414.177">Well,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3416.19">You</a>  mean, well, we did, we were the final report subcommittee put this together.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3420.392">I</a>  know, and I didn't hear any of this then, so.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3425.555">Well,</a>  I know, but Eunice wasn't on that committee, so.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3429.197">Okay,</a>  but you've done plenty of committees with a lot of input previous to this, and I'm just. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3434.921">That's</a>  true. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3436.141">I'm</a>  confused by all this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3438.062">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3438.603">I'm</a>  not a very smart guy, so you have to kind of walk me through this.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3442.925">Well,</a>  I think what we have here is we just pulled out, highlighted some of our main major recommendations in the final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3452.452">And</a>  there's this thought that since we didn't pull out articles, we didn't mention articles 1, 5, or 10, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3460.838">Do</a>  we do 9? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3461.698">We</a>  might not have 9 in there either.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3463.259">I</a>  think we kind of went. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3467.733">all</a>  through these different articles.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3469.853">No,</a>  we have nine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3470.574">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3472.494">So</a>  1, 5, and 10, do we add them here just to sort of illustrate that they exist in this body, in this part of the final report to illustrate that they exist and indicate what they are? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3486.217">And</a>  they're all new to the, they would all be new to Medford because Medford hasn't had any of them in the past, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3492.898">So,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3495.497">So</a>  to my mind, there's two ways of doing it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3498.679">We</a>  could, at the very beginning, say articles 1, 5, and 10, and then sort of list what they are and say, you know, to include just a sentence about these or these are included in the chart, or we could put them in order.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3515.289">I</a>  would say put them in order, myself.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3516.91">Put</a>  them in order.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3517.471">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3518.351">Why</a>  would you be ambiguous to let someone punch holes in it?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3527.92">The</a>  proposal is in the recommendation section to at least make reference in order to Articles 1, 5, and 10, name what they are, and come up with a sentence. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3542.7">That</a>  explains their existence in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3545.282">Does</a>  that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3546.803">Does</a>  that sound right units?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3548.784">Yeah,</a>  just like you said, in order, you know, what the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3553.548">What</a>  the section is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3559.552">and</a>  then a sentence or two of what that section does. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3565.995">Then</a>  based on the best practices of a modern charter, we are recommending that this be included in our charter.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3579.142">That</a>  could go to every article, not just those.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3584.91">Yeah,</a>  that's true.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3585.971">I</a>  mean, good point.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3587.692">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3588.453">So,</a>  I mean, come on.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3590.614">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3592.075">So,</a>  I guess we'll vote on whether to do that, but I guess what I want to say is if we vote on it and say that language will be crafted as discussed, is that okay?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3606.965">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I'm comfortable with either you or Gene or <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3611.054">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3612.035">You</a>  know, as part of that committee, I think Phyllis was also part of that committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3616.658">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3617.219">Any</a>  one of you drafting, you know, something appropriate.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3620.361">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3621.602">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3621.982">So</a>  does everyone understand what the addition we're talking about is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3626.006">That</a>  we would put Article 1 before this legislative branch recommendations and then we would do the same for 5 and 10.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3635.853">I'm</a>  confused.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3637.812">Okay,</a>  so right now, we have a summary of the major recommendations, and then we go into more detail, and we start with Article 2, because we didn't highlight anything from Article 1. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3652.681">But</a>  the concern is that when you look at that, you say to yourself, well, where's Article 1, and where's Article 5, and where's Article 10? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3662.868">Where's</a>  the concern from? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3665.743">Some</a>  of the people that have read it have read the report.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3669.592">I</a>  haven't seen too many people being concerned about it.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3673.751">Well,</a>  we're going to, you know, the proposal on the table is that we add.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3679.617">So,</a>  you're saying there's one person just. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3682.76">No,</a>  there are two people that are on my committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3686.584">Okay,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3687.485">We're</a>  going to vote on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3688.386">We'll</a>  find out if there's more.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3691.209">Looking</a>  at it from the point of view of somebody who's going to be reading it.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3698.497">It's</a>  not going to change or add any information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3700.619">It's</a>  just making it easier to kind of go through.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3702.762">It's</a>  not going to change or add any information. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3708.127">It's</a>  just adding in those articles in this sort of outline of the charter and our recommendations to sort of show that they will exist in the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3719.199">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3720.562">It</a>  is clarity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3721.783">And</a>  I'd like to say something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3725.086">I</a>  don't know about the rest of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3726.387">I</a>  am a little tired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3728.388">This</a>  has been a long journey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3729.569">And</a>  I've been at the shortest amount of all of you.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3731.811">I'm</a>  sorry for that.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3735.434">But</a>  I do appreciate these suggestions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3737.916">I</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3738.617">And</a>  I like hearing everyone talk and say what they want to say and do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3743.861">So</a>  and a lot of times I thank them for giving me clarity on things, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3748.332">I</a>  think that if someone wants to read this, they might say, hey, wait a minute, where are 1 through 1? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3752.495">Where</a>  is 1? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3753.176">Where</a>  is 5? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3753.516">Where</a>  is 10? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3754.677">You</a>  know, it's a point I missed, so thanks.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3758.259">OK,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3760.101">OK,</a>  so let's vote on whether we wanted to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3763.503">Does</a>  everyone understand what the proposal is? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3766.885">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3767.886">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3770.128">All</a>  right, let's vote on whether to add it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3772.65">Danielle?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3774.111">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3775.592">Jean?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3778.657">Yes,</a>  Eunice? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3780.217">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3782.098">Phyllis?</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3782.878">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3783.698">Maury?</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3784.598">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3786.018">Anthony</a>  Andreadola?</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3790.139">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3792.06">Ron?</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3793.5">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3794.78">I</a>  think it's just me, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3797.681">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3799.101">I'm</a>  okay with it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3800.181">I'll</a>  say yes, even though I don't really think we have to, but I'm okay with doing it, so I'll say yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3805.082">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3809.398">Any</a>  other proposals for changes or additions?</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3814.863">I</a>  just, I don't know if anyone from the community is on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3820.507">Something</a>  that we at the beginning of this process was there supposed to be an important part of our meetings was to have a public participation we we we've stopped even asking. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3833.337">If</a>  if there was any public that wanted to comment on things before we voted that we spent a lot of time coming up with a process to ensure that that happened and we're not even <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3847.085">checking</a>  right now.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3848.145">So</a>  thanks, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3849.345">And</a>  I appreciate you bringing that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3850.806">I</a>  mean, you know, these votes are about a report that that was read by the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3857.007">And</a>  I so I mean, that's why I didn't ask for public input on it, because, you know, they didn't really read the report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3866.409">And</a>  so it's not really decision making around the charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3873.471">But</a>  I definitely wanted to make. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3877.073">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3877.773">I</a>  appreciate last few meetings.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3880.095">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3880.635">I</a>  mean, we always ask for it at the end for sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3885.438">So</a>  and Bill, Bill Giglio would like to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3889.781">So</a>  go ahead, Bill. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3896.464">You're</a>  muted, I think.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3897.745">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3899.886">To</a>  that point, and I appreciate Anthony saying that, but I've listened to a lot of these meetings, and I honestly, I don't think I've ever felt like the public hasn't had that chance to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3914.098">I've</a>  always spoke when one wanted to, and you guys have always let me, so I just wanted to let you know that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3918.761">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3919.422">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3919.882">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3925.562">And</a>  I do want to open the floor for any comments from anybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3930.028">But</a>  is there anybody on the committee that has any changes or additions to the final report?</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3934.254">There's</a>  something in the chat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3939.401">Hold</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3942.861">Oh,</a>  Frances gave us the spelling of, that was from before, Danielle, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3950.507">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3951.548">And</a>  Jean, can you see that Frances put the spelling of Adam's name? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3954.95">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3956.691">Thank</a>  you, Frances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3958.173">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3959.874">Okay,</a>  so in that case, we're going to vote to accept this final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3966.107">And</a>  everybody looked at the appendix, you saw, you know, okay with everything that we included, anything else you think we should include? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3973.211">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3974.112">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3975.393">Final</a>  report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3977.294">So</a>  this is, you're going to vote either yes or no to accept this final report with the additions that we made tonight and the changes we made tonight to be submitted to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=3990.582">Ron.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4087.945">No,</a>  I just want to thank each and every one of you guys for taking the time to do this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4092.147">You</a>  guys really did a great job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4093.848">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4094.848">Everyone's</a>  been asking for the chatter review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4097.189">I'm</a>  just disappointed on the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4102.279">you</a>  know, not getting involved as much as we've been hearing people wanting change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4106.94">And</a>  I know Eunice alone has been doing everything to promote as much as she could with this and everybody else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4113.222">But</a>  it's just disappointing that the community didn't get a little more involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4117.083">But</a>  in any event, I probably listened to about 80% of the meetings and I really appreciate what you guys did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4122.564">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4123.404">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4124.624">Okay,</a>  Maury and then Danielle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4126.405">Maury.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4128.239">I</a>  just want to thank everybody from day one for everything that we've done, whether on the left side or the right side, we've come together here and it's been a great experience and I appreciate everybody and hope we all know each other better.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4145.727">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4146.488">Thanks,</a>  Maureen.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4148.029">Danielle.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4149.966">I</a>  was going to say something similar just how grateful I am to have met all of you and to work together on this and also specifically to Milva. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4156.133">I</a>  think it can maybe feel like a thankless job like wrangling all of us all the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4161.198">I</a>  know the first time I met you this felt like a really far away goal and so I just hope that you feel really proud of everything that <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4168.606">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4169.307">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4170.488">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4171.408">This</a>  has been in the works for years, you guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4173.67">And</a>  I do want to just speak briefly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4177.514">Francis</a>  is putting a note, appreciation note as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4181.457">Nice</a>  job. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4181.937">I</a>  appreciate all the diverse thought perspectives that have led to the completion of this group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4186.041">Thank</a>  you, Francis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4188.362">I</a>  want to just talk, before we wrap up, I want to talk briefly about what happens next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4192.623">But</a>  I also just, like I said, it's been a long time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4196.204">People</a>  have been talking about charter review in the city for so many years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4199.044">And</a>  regardless of what happens next, we, a citizen-led committee, did this work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4206.586">We</a>  did a review. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4207.766">And</a>  that final report will exist. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4211.127">And</a>  no matter what happens, it's there and the work has been done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4215.168">And</a>  I really thank all of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4217.238">And</a>  I also thank the Collins Center, whose help has been invaluable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4223.685">And</a>  all the members of the public who came to our meetings and participated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4227.349">Because</a>  we did have a good amount of public participation when you add up the listening sessions, surveys, and all our meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4234.437">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4237.052">So</a>  Jean and I will just coordinate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4239.614">We</a>  will get this to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4241.895">And</a>  after that, it's basically in the mayor's hands. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4248.9">And</a>  eventually, the city council will be involved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4253.142">And</a>  we'll see what, I know Eunice did tell everyone about a city council meeting next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4261.868">Next</a>  Wednesday night, 7 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4265.473">And</a>  if people want to go to that, you know, it's not any, there's no official capacity for us to go to that meeting, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4275.296">Phyllis</a>  is laughing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4277.637">Go</a>  to another meeting? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4279.698">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4280.898">You</a>  can read what's in the chat, Melva. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4282.459">Oh,</a>  I'm placing a barbecue for all of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4287.201">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4291.342">Maury,</a>  I don't know Maury, there's a rumor going around. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4294.734">Do</a>  kind of you Maury, we appreciate it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4298.397">Oh,</a>  really? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4299.919">What's</a>  the rumor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4301.78">That</a>  you're going to host a barbecue for all of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4303.922">Oh,</a>  I'll do that any day of the week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4306.965">You</a>  know that.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4307.646">Can</a>  you talk to Danielle? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4310.508">Does</a>  Murray have ice cream? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4312.51">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4313.071">Frances</a>  will ask him.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4314.652">No,</a>  so I can bring that in, whatever you like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4317.995">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4320.558">Wait,</a>  somebody else had their hand up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4321.859">Oh,</a>  I did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4322.94">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4324.62">Always</a>  with you, Jean.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4326.101">Yeah,</a>  me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4326.861">I'm</a>  just going to make this go to 830. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4331.502">Should</a>  we have a representative attend City Council, I guess, was my question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4335.704">And</a>  should we nominate someone or a group of us taking turns to answer any questions City Council has? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4343.006">I</a>  feel like just handing it to them without any presence of the committee might <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4349.719">Yeah,</a>  well, I don't know that they'll like their meeting.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4353.922">She's</a>  exactly right.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4355.583">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4356.963">I'm</a>  with you, Jean, right by your shoulders. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4360.846">You</a>  know that.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4361.826">Well,</a>  their meeting is scheduled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4363.527">Their</a>  first meeting on this is scheduled for Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4366.129">And</a>  I don't know that they'll have I don't know what material they'll have seen of ours before that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4372.833">But</a>  Ron and then you know, show up.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4376.466">Yeah,</a>  I think my point is that our presentation has not been presented to them yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4383.948">So</a>  I don't think it's necessarily, you know, I'd be happy to answer questions about once they read our presentation, but to reinvent the wheel with them again, just doesn't seem to make sense to us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4394.71">If</a>  they were calling us in to ask questions of what we voted on, happy to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4399.632">But</a>  this is kind of like, what do you guys think again? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4401.752">And</a>  I just don't think we represent, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4405.445">That's</a>  my opinion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4406.126">I</a>  think we should wait until they have it in hand and have read it.</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4409.248">Let</a>  me ask you this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4411.489">You've</a>  been around probably longer than I have, aren't you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4414.651">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4415.432">No,</a>  I haven't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4417.934">I</a>  know I haven't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4419.855">Anyway,</a>  make a long story short. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4424.498">Just</a>  the presence of alone gets these people upset. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4428.769">and</a>  they start questioning where they come from, especially the ones that only been there a year or two or three years. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4436.698">And</a>  it may not be a bad idea to just sit in the audience, and I'd be happy to do that.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4444.803">Okay,</a>  I think we're citizens, we can listen to any meeting we want to say in an official capacity, you know, we know what I'm saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4455.193">Yeah,</a>  this document is what they should be asking questions.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4458.836">Well,</a>  the question of the group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4462.707">Is</a>  this group officially dissolved as at the end of this meeting?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4467.169">That's</a>  a good question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4468.269">I</a>  mean, I don't think that there's anything official about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4472.231">I</a>  can tell you that this will be our last meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4475.992">We</a>  don't have any other meetings scheduled and we will be submitting our final report. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4482.794">The</a>  mayor might ask us to participate in some meetings in the future. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4488.536">That's</a>  going to be up to her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4491.348">I</a>  don't know, like, if there's an official dissolution, but we are, you know, we just voted to submit our final report, and that'll be, you know, our work is done.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4502.094">The</a>  only thing I'm concerned about is protocol. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4506.657">I'm</a>  just concerned about protocol, that it goes to the mayor who appointed us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4510.939">We</a>  shouldn't be talking about that presentation until the mayor has handed it over to city council, is my opinion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4517.677">Then</a>  we can talk about details. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4519.337">I</a>  think having a discussion about what we voted on is not fair to the process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4524.359">And</a>  that's all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4525.259">I'm</a>  happy.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4525.759">No,</a>  I hear you, Ron. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4526.979">I</a>  hear you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4527.659">I</a>  understand.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4528.1">I</a>  want to talk about it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4529.44">But</a>  whether we're commissioned or decommissioned, we are always part of history that we created it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4534.681">So</a>  we're always going to be somewhat experts on the subject matter of why we voted for what we voted for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4540.823">But</a>  to me, it's good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4542.203">The</a>  process is the mayor who appointed us should get to look at it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4547.012">She'll</a>  decide when it goes to city council and then they can bring us in and we have a great discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4551.294">But</a>  to do it beforehand, it doesn't make sense.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4553.716">I</a>  hear you, but we are still living with the reality that the council's governance committee is having a meeting on charter review on Wednesday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4563.761">It's</a>  been publicized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4564.782">So</a>  I hear you.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4568.804">Milva,</a>  how are they going to review this if we're not giving it to the mayor till Monday?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4574.95">I</a>  know, or maybe not until the end of the week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4577.632">Well,</a>  it depends on the timeline.</p>

    <p>[Andreottola]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4581.095">May</a>  I ask another question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4583.096">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4584.597">Can</a>  a city council do a charter? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4588.119">I</a>  was under the impression that elected officials, it's a separate process that they can do amendments, but they can't actually write a charter themselves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4603.82">Am</a>  I incorrect?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4604.6">I</a>  don't know if you're correct or incorrect, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4607.842">Let's</a>  ask Anthony or Marilyn, I mean, yeah, about that.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4618.166">Some</a>  communities have a charter review process in their charter and we have seen councils make significant revisions to charters and in some cases, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4634.342">A</a>  committee is appointed that includes members that are chosen by the mayor and members that are chosen by the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4641.708">And</a>  then this committee presents their report to the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4646.473">And</a>  councils have taken this on themselves, too.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4651.197">You</a>  mean charter review? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4652.298">Taken</a>  charter review on themselves? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4654.52">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4656.784">I</a>  need to say something here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4657.784">Go</a>  ahead, Leonis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4659.165">The</a>  city council has made it perfectly clear in several meetings this year that they will be writing a charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4670.973">They</a>  will consider the work that we have done, and their feeling is, and you can go back and look at the tapes, I think I've actually provided them to you before, that because <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4684.743">The</a>  mayor appointed us and we are not elected. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4688.648">The</a>  work is illegitimate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4691.191">That</a>  is the word that has been used and that because we are not an elected commission or committee that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4702.373">Basically,</a>  the elected officials will be writing a charter and that is their feeling on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4711.719">The</a>  governance committee, this iteration of the city council has decided that in this two-year term, they would be writing a charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4722.887">Um,</a>  and as I said earlier, um, they've been bantering around the idea for a while. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4728.288">Um,</a>  then, uh, they're now getting started on it and, um, uh, I communicated with Justin saying the committee to make sure of, um, the date of the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4743.092">And</a>  he said we would be invited to all future meetings and in the, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4750.002">resident</a>  engagement committee that they had last week, where they touched on the charter as part of writing up their monthly newsletter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4759.689">Councilor</a>  Zhang specifically said that he noticed that there was a member of the charter committee on the resident engagement committee Zoom last week, that being me, and that he would hoped that I would share with the group that they're not trying to step on anybody's toes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4779.603">quote</a>  unquote, but they are beginning to write their own charter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4787.028">So</a>  my question to you guys is this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4791.891">I</a>  also think that it's a good idea for us to be present at these meetings, whether in person or on Zoom, just to let them know that we're there and that we've done all this and that we're there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4809.579">We're</a>  not going away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4813.08">But</a>  would it be proper and appropriate for us to be asking questions of them as they do their work or answering questions that might be posed if they see one of us on a Zoom or sitting in chambers? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4834.824">If</a>  they were to ask us questions, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4839.348">would</a>  it be appropriate for us to be answering? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4843.03">I</a>  know at the low profile for the 22 months where we've spoken as one voice and I know we've all watched some of these meetings and I know nobody has spoken up because we made that agreement early on that we would just sit back quietly and do our work and be diligent and get to this point and here we are.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4867.1">Okay,</a>  thanks, Eunice. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4868.24">Maury,</a>  did you wanna say something?</p>

    <p>[Maury Carroll]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4872.042">Yeah,</a>  I hear exactly what Eunice is saying, but I think our approach should be at this point, let them show their hand and let us sit up, let us sit outside to be able to punch holes in them, because they're gonna sit up, they're gonna sit there and just punch holes in everything that we have done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4897.147">That's</a>  how this goes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4900.148">So</a>  why don't we just sit outside, listen to what they have to say, and go back to the mayor and say, this is our thing, and how do we find a happy balance here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4915.353">That's</a>  all I'm saying. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4916.833">Let's</a>  not go out there and punch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4919.094">We</a>  are going to produce our document, which explains all of our work over this <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4927.043">I'm</a>  period. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4929.304">And</a>  they're gonna, they have none. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4931.885">They're</a>  pulling straws just to kick us in the ass. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4937.587">They've</a>  done nothing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4939.368">And</a>  you follow this very clearly that they keep talking about their charter study committee, their governance committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4951.07">They've</a>  done nothing, so let's call them out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4954.994">Let</a>  them show their hand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4957.176">We</a>  already have our hand, and let's just sit back and wait and see.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4962.881">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4963.842">Phyllis?</a> </p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4966.525">I</a>  may be hearing things incorrectly, but is what you're saying, Eunice, and is that <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4973.733">All</a>  the work that the committee has done here can be just tossed aside.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4977.416">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4978.977">Yeah,</a>  that's that's how exactly how I interpret it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4982.259">The</a>  word was used and I'll go back and find the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4986.782">The</a>  tape, we're not elected.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4991.0">There</a>  was one meeting where those comments were made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4994.181">Exactly,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4995.181">I</a>  do think that they will look at our report and take it seriously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=4999.142">Well,</a>  we hope they will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5000.922">I</a>  think they will. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5002.263">We'll</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5003.203">So</a>  do I. Anthony Wilson, can I ask you a question?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5010.365">Through</a>  the chair, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5012.045">Thank</a>  you, Anthony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5012.725">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5013.385">I'm</a>  sorry, Melba. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5014.425">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5016.266">Anthony.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5017.791">Have</a>  you, or is it Marie, have you had instances where a committee, a charity study group has been appointed by a mayor, and then all of that work has been tossed aside by city council?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Ivan Wilson]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5035.575">Marilyn,</a>  I don't know if you want to chime in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5037.016">I</a>  don't have anything.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5037.816">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5038.376">I</a>  was saying, Marie, I'm sorry.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5042.017">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5043.597">There</a>  was a committee that in one city <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5047.528">and</a>  the council refused to take it up.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5053.892">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5054.412">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5055.033">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5056.093">Jean.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5056.654">Sorry,</a>  but these things happen.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5058.795">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5061.677">I</a>  made the comment in the spirit of hoping it would be a collaborative process with the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5067.04">I</a>  do think there is intention there for them to consider the work that we have done, at least what I've heard from Councilors. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5074.623">But</a>  I think Ron raised a good point that we are appointed by the mayor and I wonder if we could get clarity from the mayor on what our role is once we hand this report to her and are we. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5090.002">Officially</a>  still committee members like if. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5093.364">If</a>  Eunice wants to go to a meeting, is she going as Eunice a citizen or units as a committee member? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5099.028">Does</a>  the mayor want us to have any engagement with city? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5102.03">I</a>  guess. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5102.93">Given</a>  how we were appointed, we should. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5106.552">Get</a>  our marching orders from the mayor as to the next.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5110.675">Yeah,</a>  so what I've heard from the mayor is that if committee members want to go to these meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5118.06">It's.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5119.356">Since</a>  we are invested, we're so invested in it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5123.578">So</a>  I guess what I would say is it's up to you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5126.98">I</a>  mean, I hear Ron's point and I do think that it's legitimate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5134.552">Because</a>  we do have this body of work and there is a process that's going to take place where it's going to go to the mayor and then the mayor presents it to the city council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5144.018">And</a>  it's a little unclear to me what the council is doing at the next two meetings that they've scheduled. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5149.802">So</a>  I think it's okay if people want to attend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5155.186">But,</a>  you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5158.737">The</a>  process that we were appointed for was to create this report for the mayor, which we have done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5165.922">And</a>  then there will be a process that will be up to the mayor, what she does with what we've submitted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5174.908">So</a>  if we do go to the council meetings, I don't think it would be in, I don't know if I would use the word official, but I think it's fine for people to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5184.015">And</a>  it's unclear, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5189.078">what</a>  we would, I mean, even just to listen, it's fine for people to go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5193.16">So</a>  I think it's up to people whether they want to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5197.463">Ron?</a> </p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5198.863">Yeah,</a>  I'd also like to find out if, because we voted on it today, does it become part of public record as of today? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5205.487">Or</a>  when the final, when you clean it up and present it to the mayor on next Friday or whatever, is that when it becomes public? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5212.351">Because</a>  I think that's very important. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5214.232">There's</a>  a document that's not public <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5216.542">should</a>  not be presented at any public meetings other than where it's intended. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5220.965">So</a>  I think we need to have a decision on that too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5222.866">I</a>  don't want to start getting in the weeds and I appreciate Danielle's, you know, we're citizens first, you know, we can have an opinion on this stuff for sure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5233.413">But</a>  when we're wearing the hat of charter, <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5237.195">I</a>  think we have to really be careful what is a public document what's not a public document until the in my opinion The mayor deserves first look But if we're not presenting it to the mayor, they'll say say we haven't cleaned it up until friday Which is reasonable if we go wednesday and pull out the document that we see as of right now I just don't I just don't think it's a it's a professional way.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5259.947">No,</a>  I don't think anybody's pulling out a document but but uh, danielle your question, I mean <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5266.413">All</a>  our meetings have been public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5268.134">All</a>  our votes have been public. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5269.835">So</a>  I think it's fine if somebody says, well, what's going to happen with ward representation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5278.34">I</a>  think it's fine to say, well, the committee voted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5281.282">We</a>  can say what we voted on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5283.703">That's</a>  all public.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5285.945">We</a>  want to get together in the future to be like, let's show up at this thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5291.128">Communicate</a>  as a group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5292.369">It's</a>  OK to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5293.329">It</a>  doesn't violate.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5295.679">And</a>  you mean if we, if, if some of us, but we wouldn't be meeting as the metric charter study committee.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5301.201">Yeah,</a>  I guess that's my question is like when somebody asks, are we dissolved? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5304.722">Like</a>  we are no longer defined in that way.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5306.703">So</a>  we're not calling any of it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5308.244">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5308.444">We're</a>  not calling any official meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5310.965">Um,</a>  I mean, I mean, when we go to more barbecue, for instance, I don't think we'll violate open meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5316.627">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5325.215">Because</a>  I follow all this so closely, I'm happy to keep everybody updated as to when the meetings are using our email chain that we've had. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5339.566">Then</a>  that way, people can show up or log on as they wish and see you there.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5351.444">I</a>  think it's fine to let people know when the meetings are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5353.906">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5356.707">I</a>  think that a lot of this is going to become clearer as the process unfolds, it will become clearer.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5366.353">Frankly,</a>  I don't think that the city council is going to get terribly far with this in this term. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5374.577">Thank</a>  you, Jean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5379.888">You</a>  take care. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5380.749">Thanks</a>  for all your contributions.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5383.693">I'll</a>  be in touch about the timeline.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5385.235">See</a>  you at the barbecue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5387.357">Bring</a>  the ice cream. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5391.623">You</a>  know, I don't think they're going to get too far. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5393.665">I</a>  mean, they seem to be, you know, intent on getting this done before the end of this term, which, you know, they have, what, 14, 15 months left. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5403.611">I</a>  mean, keep in mind, you know, I know we all have other lives and other jobs and families and things, but working on this charter has been our only job for 22 months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5413.738">And</a>  we've clearly put in the time to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5418.32">They,</a>  in addition to having their own lives and jobs and things like that, have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5424.843">You</a>  know, a governing the city, they're writing tree ordinances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5428.185">They're</a>  writing rodent ordinances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5430.186">They're</a>  passing a budget, you know, dealing with potholes all sorts of other things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5437.13">You</a>  know, it takes them a year to write a leaf blower ordinance. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5442.133">You</a>  know, are they really going to get a charter written 14 months?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5446.078">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5447.999">Yeah,</a>  like I said, it's unclear exactly and it will become clear as it unfolds. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5454.021">I</a>  think this is all I can really say. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5456.222">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5458.182">Phyllis,</a>  did you want to? <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5460.523">No,</a>  I was just shaking my head, trying to think of all the things that we're talking about.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5465.985">Did</a>  you have something else you wanted to say, Ron?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5468.146">No,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5469.906">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5470.767">So,</a>  um, does anybody, does anybody else on the committee have anything that they want to address or.</p>

    <p>[Phyllis Morrison]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5479.672">No,</a>  I just want to say that I have learned so much from being part of this group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5486.756">I</a>  had, I had some idea about what went on in the city, but I didn't know all the ins and outs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5491.458">So</a>  I want to thank everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5493.499">Um,</a>  I want to thank, I'll thank the mayor for the opportunity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5496.661">Thank</a>  you for all your hard work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5498.432">Thank</a>  you to everybody that showed up every week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5501.694">It</a>  was a lot of hard work, and the conversations were really enlightening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5505.976">I</a>  could only see something one way sometimes, and then I'd listen to Ron or Anthony or Mari or Eunice or everybody, and I would go, oh, wait a minute, let me think about it that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5516.741">For</a>  me, that was a very, very rewarding experience. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5520.222">So</a>  my sincere thanks to all of you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5522.283">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5522.783">Thank</a>  you, Phyllis.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5524.964">Okay,</a>  does anybody, any members of the public want to speak?</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5534.067">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5536.628">I'll</a>  just add as well, you know, my thanks to everybody and it's been a pleasure getting to know those who I didn't know before and working with everybody, you know, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5550.878">hashing</a>  things out and deliberating and debating and we came up with a pretty darn good product for the city. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5559.023">I</a>  ran into Brianna in Wegmans on Saturday at the deli counter and talked a little bit about this and I ended with the following, somebody ought to canonize Melva for sainthood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5576.044">Not</a>  even close.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5578.046">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5578.546">Thank</a>  you for keeping us together, keeping our spirits up, keeping us organized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5585.452">Everything</a>  that you've done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5587.153">When</a>  Larwell left, I think a few of us suggested that maybe somebody else take the co-chair seat with you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5593.818">And</a>  you took it on by yourself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5599.429">You</a>  know, and we were not an easy group to corral sometimes.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5603.37">You</a>  guys are all great.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5604.77">So</a>  I've heard in cats.</p>

    <p>[Ron Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5606.371">Just</a>  for the record, Eunice, she only had one miracle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5609.812">There's</a>  two more to go.</p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5612.492">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5615.113">You</a>  know, thank you, Milva, for keeping us all together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5617.814">And</a>  thank you to everybody else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5620.255">It's</a>  been quite a journey. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5621.775">And</a>  I can't believe it's finally over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5624.556">I</a>  know.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5625.831">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5626.611">Well,</a>  again, I want to just thank you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5632.233">It's</a>  been a great experience. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5635.874">Once</a>  we get the final report, just make those few changes, clean it up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5639.935">I</a>  will let you-all know when it's submitted so you know that it's been submitted to the mayor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5646.337">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5647.258">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Eunice Browne]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5649.538">Anthony</a>  and Marilyn too for all of you guys.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5652.919">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5653.099">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/charter-study-committee-10-03-24&start=5653.439">Yes.</a> </p>
