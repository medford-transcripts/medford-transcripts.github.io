00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:28,948
[SPEAKER_02]: The meeting is called to order.

17
00:00:30,353 --> 00:00:33,437
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Committee of the Whole at 6 p.m.

18
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:39,304
[SPEAKER_02]: in the City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, and via Zoom.

[SPEAKER_02]: To submit written comments, please email ahertabase at medfordma.gov.

20
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:54,790
[SPEAKER_02]: The action discussion items tonight are 21-057 offered by former Council President Morell and President Bears's leaf blower ordinance.

21
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,952
[SPEAKER_02]: The draft was distributed to members of the council by the city clerk.

22
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:03,893
[SPEAKER_02]: It is attached to this meeting packet.

23
00:01:04,213 --> 00:01:11,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It includes the draft ordinance based on the 10 motions that are November 15th, 2023,

24
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:23,041
[SPEAKER_02]: committee of the whole meeting, and it was also submitted to the city administration for legal review and the updated draft with legal comments from KP Law is attached.

25
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:25,082
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that draft now.

26
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:26,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to go through it.

27
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:32,786
[SPEAKER_02]: It reflects again, as I said, the motions made at our November 15th, 2023 meeting.

28
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:39,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a few questions from KP Law.

29
00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:48,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are joined by our new building commissioner, who we will hear from at some point during the meeting as well if we have questions.

30
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:53,374
[SPEAKER_02]: So just going to get this going here.

31
00:01:53,394 --> 00:02:02,520
[SPEAKER_02]: How is this looking for folks on the screens?

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we see it?

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Could zoom in a little bit if helpful.

34
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Visible?

35
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:20,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

36
00:02:20,668 --> 00:02:20,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

37
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:29,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a memorandum from January 31st, revision of the leaf blower ordinance to reflect the motions from our meeting.

38
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:42,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Largely, this has stayed similar to the initial draft in terms of the title, obviously, the purpose and intent of the ordinance, and the definitions mostly.

39
00:02:42,198 --> 00:02:49,361
[SPEAKER_02]: And these line changes that you'll see in here, these are the line change suggestions of KP Law Council.

40
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:55,323
[SPEAKER_02]: But the definitions, we have a definition of commercial leaf blower operator,

41
00:02:56,311 --> 00:03:01,093
[SPEAKER_02]: We have electric leaf blowers, gas-powered leaf blowers and owners of large property.

42
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:12,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is where it differs from the draft one and draft two, where all of the regulations were all compiled into kind of one lump section that was difficult to read and discern what applied to who.

43
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,678
[SPEAKER_02]: This separates them all out into sections, essentially three sections.

44
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:20,039
[SPEAKER_02]: One, that would be general regulations that apply to all leaf blowers.

45
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:38,966
[SPEAKER_02]: which I'll go through first, and then a set of regulations for the commercial operators, municipal operators, municipal contractors, and owners of large property, and then a much shorter section on the residential use of leaf blowers.

46
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:44,678
[SPEAKER_02]: But the general regulation on the use of leaf blowers, pretty basic stuff.

47
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:48,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Satisfy emission standards of the EPA.

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Not be permitted for more than one continuous hour a day in the city at a particular property.

49
00:03:55,223 --> 00:04:02,466
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're leaving a leaf blower on for an hour, it's consistently on without any stops.

50
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:13,967
[SPEAKER_02]: There's on parcels of 10,000 square feet or less, one leaf blower may be used at a time on parcels larger than 10,000 square feet, one per 10,000 square foot area.

51
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:23,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we have not causing any debris to be deposited onto other parcels or the public right of way.

52
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:33,071
[SPEAKER_02]: On this one, we have in no event shall leaves and basically debris be blown into catch basins or onto vehicles.

53
00:04:34,352 --> 00:04:40,656
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have a comment from the legal counsel suggesting the removal of swept or raked here.

54
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:54,305
[SPEAKER_02]: Similarly here, the various debris shall be removed in a sanitary manner to prevent it from just being blown around by the wind or

55
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,706
[SPEAKER_02]: being thrown around and someone running through it or driving through it.

56
00:04:58,426 --> 00:05:05,849
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some questions here again from council specifically on what the languages shall be removed by whom and what the sanitary manner means.

57
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something we can come back and address.

58
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:20,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And then very explicitly saying that you can't use a leaf blower to blow around masonry or construction dust and debris, which as we know is pretty harmful.

59
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:28,778
[SPEAKER_02]: The section 3859 regulates municipal use, commercial operators, and owners of large property.

60
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:40,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, it says that any time of year, you can use electric leaf blowers, just subject to the noise and nuisance control ordinance of the city.

61
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can only use them 7 a.m.

62
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:45,895
[SPEAKER_02]: to 6 p.m., just like any noise-making ordinance.

63
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,539
[SPEAKER_02]: any noise-making machinery.

64
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically, the noise of nuisance ordinance already applies to leaf blowers.

65
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:54,242
[SPEAKER_02]: This is restating ordinance that already exists.

66
00:05:56,704 --> 00:06:02,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Something from the last meeting regarding gas-powered leaf blowers is we had prohibitions on the specific time frame for use.

67
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:13,368
[SPEAKER_02]: in here have it being prohibited except between March 15th and May 31st and September 15th and December 15th.

68
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:19,689
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the prime time in the spring and fall for property cleaning.

69
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:25,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have discussed that and had some public input suggesting that we widen that range and that was included here.

70
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:32,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Also subject to the noise and nuisance control ordinances, which is already true, but it's just stating it here.

71
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:49,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Commercial operators, municipal operators, municipal contractors, and owners of large property would adhere to applicable OSHA requirements with respect to use of PPE to make sure that everyone who's using these machines is following those requirements.

72
00:06:51,593 --> 00:07:07,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And then section four gets into kind of the I would say the bulk of what this is about is having ensuring that the larger operators and institutional operators property owners are submitting an operations plan to the building commissioner and

73
00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:25,133
[SPEAKER_02]: That would allow the building commissioner to ensure that everyone who's operating these in the city is following the ordinance, understand what their plans are to mitigate the impact and noise and emissions on the neighboring properties.

74
00:07:25,834 --> 00:07:37,904
[SPEAKER_02]: include an inventory of what equipment they own and they plan to use, include how they plan to educate their users of the equipment on safety precautions and proper use of the equipment.

75
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:47,972
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a comment here of, you know, when shall an operations plan be submitted, by what date, how often does it apply, is it every year, etc.

76
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:50,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll come back and discuss that.

77
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:59,610
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a standard fee that would be paid for submitting an operations plan, which is just sufficient to cover the.

78
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:15,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, what the administrative costs are for having this system in place, and the council notes that this must be unreasonable in compliance with the Emerson college test, which is, I think, a legal court case test around what.

79
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:19,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Satisfies applicable administrative costs.

80
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,033
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that again, that's a comment.

81
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:21,693
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just true.

82
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:23,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we have to put that in the ordinance anyway.

83
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:26,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just stating what the legal standard is for.

84
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:31,686
[SPEAKER_02]: For these charging fees for administrative processes.

85
00:08:34,861 --> 00:08:51,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in section five, that the provisions of this section are not going to apply if it's using a leaf blower as necessary to maintain warranty or safety of a rubberized or similar service, or if it's performing operations and cleanup associated with special events, storms, and hurricanes.

86
00:08:52,656 --> 00:09:00,223
[SPEAKER_02]: So that section is a small change here that council has suggested saying events including but not limited to instead of and the like.

87
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:19,654
[SPEAKER_02]: For residential regulations, I think we heard pretty loud and clear from folks that they really didn't, they couldn't in the last draft of the ordinance see what was being regulated for commercial or large property, what was the regulation on like a person using a leaf blower on their own property.

88
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:28,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So we separated that out and essentially the only restrictions for a resident using a leaf blower on their own property

89
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:33,723
[SPEAKER_02]: on the property in which they reside is, you know, you can use electric leaf blowers all year.

90
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:41,972
[SPEAKER_02]: The gas leaf blowers would apply during those same, you can only use them during those same periods, March 15th to May 31st, September 15th to December 15th.

91
00:09:43,103 --> 00:09:45,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there would be de minimis use.

92
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:53,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, if you're not using it more than 10 total minutes per day, you can use it pretty much any time.

93
00:09:53,808 --> 00:10:09,255
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a small, quick thing, you wanna spend five minutes a couple times a day blowing leaves or whatever you need to use it for on your property, that would not be subject to any sort of the regulations of the ordinance.

94
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:25,186
[SPEAKER_02]: This does include a phase-out of gas-powered leaf blowers, starting with commercial leaf blower operators and owners of large property in 2026, and starting with municipal and residential owners in 2028.

95
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:33,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Wheeled leaf blowers powered by four-stroke engines are not subject to the prohibitions of this section.

96
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:35,031
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally,

97
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:40,138
[SPEAKER_02]: The enforcement section here is pretty standard.

98
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:42,299
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that the building department shall enforce.

99
00:10:42,739 --> 00:10:47,562
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to use Chapter 40, Section 21D, non-criminal disposition.

100
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:54,165
[SPEAKER_02]: The building commissioner or designee will be the decider on who enforces.

101
00:10:54,926 --> 00:11:02,530
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fines start with first offense written warning, second offense, $100, third offense or more, $200 per offense.

102
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:22,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And Council has recommended that we remove and the Finance Director has also recommended that we remove this section on fines collected under the section to be placed in a special revenue fund for the purposes of further enforcement of this ordinance, that the administrative burden and the amount of fines likely collected wouldn't make sense to create that fund.

103
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:37,997
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the effective date of the ordinance, other than the provisions already stated, would be July 1, 2024, except for any contracts that the city has signed that are in effect, and there'll be the termination of those contracts.

104
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:43,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the sum of it.

105
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:51,419
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, is there any discussion by members of the council on this draft?

106
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:54,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Any suggestions or thoughts on this ordinance?

107
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Council Vice President Collins and then Councilor Callahan.

108
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

109
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:09,397
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate the overview since we looked at this last and since this is the first time that we're meeting about this in this current term.

110
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,618
[SPEAKER_11]: It's helpful to have the overview.

111
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:15,220
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the comments that we've received from KP Law

112
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:24,427
[SPEAKER_11]: and some other partners have been helpful to get this closer to a finished product.

113
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:38,799
[SPEAKER_11]: In terms of starting at the beginning, you know, with the goals of this ordinance, I think it's clear throughout this process, you know, we've kind of tacked our way into a middle path between, you know, the goals of phasing out

114
00:12:39,747 --> 00:12:54,884
[SPEAKER_11]: a very polluting technology while making sure that this is something that is manageable from an enforcement standpoint on the city side to make sure that it's a manageable time frame for large properties and commercial users to make sure that we're

115
00:12:56,803 --> 00:13:01,684
[SPEAKER_11]: balancing the right regulations and restrictions for commercial users and for private users.

116
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:15,088
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that our process has benefited a lot from hearing from constituents and commercial users in the past and hopefully tonight as well, as well as the Chamber of Commerce and making sure that we've been tailoring and tweaking this so that it's

117
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,771
[SPEAKER_11]: fair for different use cases.

118
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:31,244
[SPEAKER_11]: And over the past couple of versions, we've also kind of tweaked that in terms of what specific restrictions we're putting forward and also what metrics and measures we're using.

119
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:42,896
[SPEAKER_11]: whether it's the amount of months in the year that we allow use of the gas-powered leaf blowers versus electric, whether it's what we're using to measure if something is within allowable ranges or not.

120
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:49,878
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad to see kind of on that seam of fairness, making sure that this is fair for different types of users.

121
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:56,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that we have removed some of the exemptions for municipal use of the leaf blowers.

122
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:00,921
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that anything that we're expecting of commercial users, we should expect of municipal contractors as well.

123
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:02,201
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's something that I'm happy to see.

124
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:16,514
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm happy to see that this, I think, is the most readable version of the ordinance that we've had yet, which is, of course, super important because some of the people using this ordinance are just, a lot of them are just homeowners, residents who just want to know, is this okay?

125
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:23,800
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, is this what my community has in mind for, you know, reality testing?

126
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Is this a reasonable time to use this tool this time of the year?

127
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:40,172
[SPEAKER_11]: So looking at the comments put forward by KB Law, I have a couple of motions in mind just to incorporate some of those suggestions, but I'm happy to save those for after comments from my fellow councillors.

128
00:14:41,593 --> 00:14:42,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Or I could just do it right now.

129
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:44,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not right now?

130
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:47,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you if you wanna.

131
00:14:48,057 --> 00:14:49,058
[SPEAKER_02]: We can wait, yeah.

132
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go to Councilor Kelly and then Councilor Scarpelli.

133
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,081
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanna note that Councilor Tseng is present.

134
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:56,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

135
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,510
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really happy to see these changes.

136
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the readability is very important.

137
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:08,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember hearing from some constituents that they felt that it was more lenient on the municipality than it was on residents.

138
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:18,575
[SPEAKER_08]: And this, I think it wasn't, but I think this reading of it makes it really clear that actually it's stricter on the commercial owners and the municipality than it is on residents.

139
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:26,382
[SPEAKER_08]: So I only have one very small question, which is about the use of wheeled leaf blowers powered by four stroke engines.

140
00:15:27,063 --> 00:15:30,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's a good reason why they're carved out from any sort of phase out.

141
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:32,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm curious what that reason is.

142
00:15:32,968 --> 00:15:39,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm wondering if there is any phase out for those planned or if we're just, you know, maybe there's a reason why there's no plant phase out.

143
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:51,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I can speak to one reason being the difference in emissions from a four-stroke engine than a two-stroke engine.

144
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:56,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that greenhouse gas emissions are a good thing, but it's less particulate.

145
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:59,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's generally a cleaner burning engine.

146
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:07,822
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing in here that would plan to phase them out at any point, but it is kind of a different beast, if you want to say.

147
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:13,709
[SPEAKER_02]: for a different size of property, something you're taking over a much wider area.

148
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:22,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm sure folks could speak to that, but that's my understanding why it is not included.

149
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:23,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

150
00:16:25,053 --> 00:16:27,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to Councilor Scarpelli.

151
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

152
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:30,895
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope everybody rested up.

153
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:34,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to bed at five in the morning this morning, so thank you.

154
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:50,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to share some comments from some of the residents and the negative impacts that they're gonna be feeling with their landscape companies.

155
00:16:51,475 --> 00:17:02,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of the people that have reached out did stress that they are senior citizens that do have homes that need to be taken care of and at the same time are on a fixed budget.

156
00:17:02,805 --> 00:17:04,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will affect people.

157
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:15,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there are some benefits that when you look at implementing this type of an ordinance, when you look at environmental measures.

158
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:17,884
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, I still haven't.

159
00:17:17,964 --> 00:17:20,467
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been researching this and I still haven't.

160
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:44,014
[SPEAKER_06]: received something that I feel comfortable about is what will happen to the batteries after use because from what we're what I'm what I'm investigating in neighboring communities that are doing this the biggest question is the effect in the environment when we have to destroy or

161
00:17:46,135 --> 00:17:50,018
[SPEAKER_06]: bury these batteries and what impact it'll make on our environment.

162
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:52,279
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are still a lot of questions.

163
00:17:52,639 --> 00:18:06,269
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the other piece that, you know, everybody, some people make comments tonight that, geez, I'm glad to hear that the municipal side, we're going to be fading into something.

164
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:09,912
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, do you understand that

165
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:26,189
[SPEAKER_06]: The average cost is between two to four million dollars for a municipality to retrofit DPW trucks for charging stations and then replacement of these batteries.

166
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:31,955
[SPEAKER_06]: These are studies that were done just in our neighboring community that they pushed it through anyway, but

167
00:18:32,615 --> 00:18:44,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Our neighboring community has a lot of money to, I believe I was told it was $3 million to retrofit their vehicles and phase in all of these new leaf blowers.

168
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:56,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we have until 2028, but I tell you what, I don't see a very good outlook for our future finances in Medford with still no development and no actual

169
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:06,064
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, responsible fiscal responsibility that's being maintained by administration.

170
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:11,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are things that I find still, um, a little concerning.

171
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:20,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Another piece that I, I received was that, you know, I, I, I'm not there right now, but I'm assuming there's at least one landscaper that's been in the city for a long time.

172
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:21,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume he's there.

173
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:28,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but for the most part, our landscapers aren't really coming out and, um,

174
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:39,595
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they're disgusted in the fact that they're just going to move away from Medford and the impact that this is playing on their part because, you know, they use they use leaf blowers.

175
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:47,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's that's how they get through power through and make sure that they can keep homes affordable when you use a landscaper.

176
00:19:47,738 --> 00:19:47,918
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

177
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:58,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a home, I'm going to use my electric blower, but I do it for what's needed and move on.

178
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:02,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just think there's a lot of variables.

179
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:14,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it sounds easy, and it's great to check off a box that we want to put in this ordinance, that it supports the environment, that it's really going

180
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:22,405
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, prepare our community later and moving in slowly into the phase out.

181
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:28,088
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are, these are difficult times and they're going to be worse in the future.

182
00:20:28,148 --> 00:20:39,333
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot of variables here that I can't support without, without more, um, more work being done to prove to me that this isn't going to be, this is going to be safer for the environment.

183
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:42,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I appreciate your time and thank you.

184
00:20:45,056 --> 00:20:46,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

185
00:20:46,336 --> 00:20:47,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lazzaro.

186
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:57,176
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I think this is a great first step towards more environmentally appropriate behaviors across the city.

187
00:20:57,616 --> 00:21:07,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And point of fact, I understand that the most environmentally conscientious way to take care of people's yards and what we do at my home

188
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:17,485
[SPEAKER_10]: that I own, not that that has an impact on anything, but we don't rake the leaves, we just leave them, and my yard looks very nice.

189
00:21:18,186 --> 00:21:24,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's better for the ecosystem and the plant life and the insects and the wildlife as well.

190
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:25,870
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's always an option.

191
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:31,793
[SPEAKER_10]: That being said, I look forward to hammering out the details of

192
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:35,496
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, the word by word edits that we need to make to this.

193
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:39,980
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that something that we can do piece by piece?

194
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have to make motions for each one?

195
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:41,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

196
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,641
[SPEAKER_10]: But yes, I'm excited about this.

197
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's great.

198
00:21:47,162 --> 00:21:55,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially I think the most significant one for the quality of life portion of it is one leaf blower operating on a property at a time.

199
00:21:56,231 --> 00:22:03,017
[SPEAKER_10]: In my experience in West Bedford, what we have in the spring and fall is like four leaf blowers going

200
00:22:03,497 --> 00:22:07,641
[SPEAKER_10]: at once, and it radiates in your skull, and it's very unpleasant.

201
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:09,663
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be great.

202
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:14,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for putting this forward, and thank you to former Council President Morell.

203
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:20,834
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yep, I'm a big supporter of this ordinance.

204
00:22:21,154 --> 00:22:21,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

205
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:24,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

206
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:25,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

207
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:26,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

208
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:37,237
[SPEAKER_13]: I think a lot has been said in this meeting and in meetings past about the environmental effects of leaf blowers and the quality of life effects with the festival levels that we're seeing in Medford.

209
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:47,265
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's the reason why we've seen so many letters and emails into the council, at least to the previous councils, about quality of life with leaf blowers.

210
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:57,011
[SPEAKER_13]: in the city and the need to act on it, and I know that's the spirit with which former Council President Morell introduced this.

211
00:22:57,151 --> 00:23:16,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, with that being said, we also recognize that as a council back then, that we needed to reach out to other stakeholders, too, who had different perspectives on the issue, who might not agree with the final product that we passed, but we recognize that in good faith, we needed to make adjustments that would let them

212
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:29,949
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, continue in a reasonable manner and to let residents who want to use certain types of leaf blowers, especially electric leaf blowers, to function and live as they want to.

213
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:43,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, you know, oftentimes we're pulled in many different directions on issues like this, but it's our job as a council to sit down and figure out how we balance those interests and how we create a compromise that is reasonable,

214
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:50,043
[SPEAKER_13]: accessible and just in a policy manner speaking, good.

215
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:56,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that this draft, having read through it before coming to this meeting, reflects that.

216
00:23:56,126 --> 00:24:03,989
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's in a much, much better shape than what we saw late last year, which I know a lot of residents had concerns about.

217
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,491
[SPEAKER_13]: We integrated those concerns and feedback and

218
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:11,992
[SPEAKER_13]: changed quite a lot in between these versions of the draft.

219
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:21,474
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just important to set out that the history of this piece of text and the compromises that have come with it as well.

220
00:24:24,634 --> 00:24:25,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

221
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:28,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comments from members of the Council?

222
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:34,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Commissioner, do you want to say anything at this time or does anyone have any questions for the Commissioner?

223
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:36,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither nor.

224
00:24:36,925 --> 00:24:37,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

225
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:40,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I will recognize Vice President Collins.

226
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:42,489
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

227
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:55,698
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to field, you know, I think that we have, having gone through this ordinance in great detail over past meetings, even though some of the members of the current council are not there for those, I think that we're at a

228
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:02,217
[SPEAKER_11]: point in this ordinance where we can think about finalizing it, reporting it out to committee.

229
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:13,933
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple of motions to make that I think get this to a place where we can report this out to regular session, but I think, you know, because we've spent so much time on this already, we have plenty of space to continue to

230
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:22,024
[SPEAKER_11]: focus in on any aspects in this meeting if we need to, to make sure that everybody is feeling comfortable and up to speed before we take next steps on this.

231
00:25:24,886 --> 00:25:31,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Towards that, I have a few motions to incorporate some of the suggestions from legal counsel.

232
00:25:32,893 --> 00:25:34,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just orient myself here.

233
00:25:34,714 --> 00:25:40,238
[SPEAKER_11]: In section 3858,

234
00:25:44,773 --> 00:25:57,163
[SPEAKER_11]: First, in subsection five, council noted that it's a bit confusing that this language refers to sweeping or raking because that's the only place in the ordinance that refers to sweeping or raking.

235
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Otherwise, we're just referring to blowing leaves.

236
00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:09,513
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would motion to delete sweep or rake, which is the suggestion made in the red line copy.

237
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:25,896
[SPEAKER_11]: And the intent there is just, you know, we've done a lot of work to make this ordinance more readable and very clear in its intent, especially for, you know, there's a wide range of people who are gonna be consulting this, city staff, contractors, residents.

238
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:32,564
[SPEAKER_11]: And we, I think, you know, simplicity is always of the essence so that two people reading the same document get the same impression out of it.

239
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:38,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So just note Council Collins, you could make one motion with all of your changes.

240
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:47,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So just for the clerk's ease, we've started a motion, you've read the first change, you can keep reading and then we'll just consider it a single motion.

241
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:48,266
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

242
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:52,228
[SPEAKER_11]: In the same section 3858 subsection 6.

243
00:26:55,879 --> 00:27:09,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It was noted that, so this says deposits of leaf, dirt, dust, et cetera, shall be removed and disposed of in a sanitary manner, which will prevent it from being dispersed by wind vandalism or similar means.

244
00:27:10,788 --> 00:27:12,769
[SPEAKER_11]: A little confusing.

245
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:22,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that rather than trying to define what sanitary matter means, I would,

246
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:25,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry.

247
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:35,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to delete in a sanitary manner and replace that with in such a manner so that it reused shall be removed and disposed of in such a manner which will prevent it from dot, dot, dot.

248
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:37,852
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm happy to pause.

249
00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:44,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

250
00:27:47,737 --> 00:27:47,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

251
00:27:47,997 --> 00:27:48,818
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I have a couple.

252
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, right.

253
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:54,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

254
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:07,853
[SPEAKER_11]: So my thought here is for the shall be removed in terms of who's accountable for doing the removal shall be removed and dispose of.

255
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:16,280
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we could either identify the property owner and the contractor or

256
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:24,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, actually, maybe this is a question to my fellow Councilors for your perspective.

257
00:28:25,754 --> 00:28:29,135
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's a named party that's responsible for doing the removing, should it be the property owner?

258
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:30,895
[SPEAKER_11]: Should it be the person?

259
00:28:35,977 --> 00:28:42,759
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been using the phrase municipal operators, municipal contractors, commercial operators, and owners of large property.

260
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,460
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just change the last one to property owners.

261
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,521
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be an or.

262
00:28:53,396 --> 00:28:53,876
[SPEAKER_11]: One second.

263
00:28:54,956 --> 00:28:56,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it could just be simpler.

264
00:28:58,017 --> 00:28:59,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on that?

265
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:12,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think in that section, I think that the phrase owners of large properties is in that section, I think, important, because there are specific regulations for large properties.

266
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:15,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I would suggest that you could just leave it as property owners.

267
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:20,104
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

268
00:29:24,687 --> 00:29:27,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we trying to call out the property owner, the landscaper, or both?

269
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:35,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're trying to... If you want to unmute, and then Councilor Lazzaro.

270
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:40,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, could we say, you know, the user of the leaf blower?

271
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Suggesting Councilor Lazzaro.

272
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:47,463
[SPEAKER_10]: You could say operator, you could say responsible party.

273
00:29:50,485 --> 00:29:51,446
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we should go with operator.

274
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:52,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

275
00:29:54,451 --> 00:29:59,335
[SPEAKER_11]: So that would be, shall be removed and disposed of by the operator in such a manner, which will.

276
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:15,089
[SPEAKER_11]: And then whenever the clerk is ready, I'll keep going.

277
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,211
[SPEAKER_02]: You can continue.

278
00:30:17,611 --> 00:30:18,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

279
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:35,869
[SPEAKER_11]: 59 subsection 4, which starts commercial leaf blowers, municipal operators, municipal contractors, and OLP shall submit an operations plan by, I think, September 1.

280
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:43,414
[SPEAKER_11]: That provides a good amount of leeway before we really get into peak leaf removal season.

281
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:47,716
[SPEAKER_11]: September 1.

282
00:30:55,205 --> 00:31:10,857
[SPEAKER_11]: And just for context, that's the operations plan that's submitted by the operator to the building commissioner, a mitigation plan for, you know, we're going to be doing leaf removal with these tools on this property.

283
00:31:11,758 --> 00:31:15,080
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is how we are going to mitigate the noise pollution.

284
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is how we are going to use the equipment.

285
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:24,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's how we're going to make sure that the equipment is safely used, is the plan, or is the content to be included in the plan.

286
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:30,306
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple of other questions here.

287
00:31:30,326 --> 00:31:33,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It was how often each year.

288
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:36,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Councilor Callahan just yes.

289
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:39,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Suggesting suggesting each year by September 1.

290
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:46,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I think each each year makes sense.

291
00:31:46,258 --> 00:31:47,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to say each year annually?

292
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,900
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

293
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that annually by September one is feels common to me.

294
00:31:56,203 --> 00:31:56,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

295
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:58,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it matters.

296
00:31:58,245 --> 00:32:02,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I don't think it would really sorry.

297
00:32:02,968 --> 00:32:03,969
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it really matter.

298
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:11,414
[SPEAKER_13]: I think each year would open the question up to each calendar year or each, um, each block of 365 days.

299
00:32:11,794 --> 00:32:13,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So annually is just clear in that sense.

300
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:16,798
[SPEAKER_13]: But any further thoughts?

301
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:18,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

302
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:23,588
[SPEAKER_11]: Next.

303
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:27,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Possibly last from me.

304
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:31,890
[SPEAKER_11]: Section 3862 subsection 3.

305
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:45,692
[SPEAKER_11]: As you noted in your overview, running this by the administration, it's felt that it's not cost effective to set up a special revenue fund for the potential fines collected by this.

306
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:49,413
[SPEAKER_11]: So my motion will be to delete that section.

307
00:32:51,374 --> 00:32:51,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

308
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:55,358
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's it for me for now.

309
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:05,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And do we also want to accept the other inline changes, not necessarily the comments on the right, but the inline changes proposed by Council?

310
00:33:05,387 --> 00:33:10,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I would accept.

311
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:12,333
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

312
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:16,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's fine, if we can just have that be an amendment to Councilor Collins' motion.

313
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:30,396
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple additions, adding section 3861, removing the word fuel, removing the word any, which comes up twice.

314
00:33:30,416 --> 00:33:35,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, is there a second?

315
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you good?

316
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:37,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second on the motion?

317
00:33:37,862 --> 00:33:39,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

318
00:33:42,266 --> 00:33:44,467
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll hold it for discussion.

319
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:50,252
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, are there any other talks of discussion by members of the council or motions by a member of the council?

320
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:58,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, Mr. Commissioner, do you have any comments after the motions that have been made that you'd like to share with us?

321
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:05,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Briefly, my name is Scott VanderWaal.

322
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:09,517
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you who haven't met, I'm just in my third week, I think, just briefly in here.

323
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:13,999
[SPEAKER_05]: So just getting up to speed on everything and dealing with some other issues.

324
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,824
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have some conversations earlier about how to implement this and follow through and what the intentions of this ultimately are.

325
00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:23,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think they can all be addressed.

326
00:34:26,787 --> 00:34:28,348
[SPEAKER_05]: and we talked about some of these changes.

327
00:34:28,408 --> 00:34:30,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm comfortable with what I've heard.

328
00:34:30,128 --> 00:34:42,232
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the whole goal is to keep it focused and to make it not a punishment exercise, but an education exercise in which if we have to take additional steps to teach folks, we're happy to do that.

329
00:34:42,352 --> 00:34:48,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm pleased with what I've been listening to in the conversations and I look forward to it.

330
00:34:48,935 --> 00:34:49,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

331
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:53,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you and welcome and appreciate you being here to serve the city.

332
00:34:56,366 --> 00:35:00,391
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll now open it up to members of the public who would like to speak.

333
00:35:00,652 --> 00:35:02,975
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

334
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:07,300
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few folks on Zoom and we'll take your name and address for the record.

335
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:14,530
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any comments on the draft ordinance and any changes that you may like to see or if you, anything else you'd like to say about it.

336
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:20,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening again.

337
00:35:21,015 --> 00:35:22,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, name and address for the record.

338
00:35:22,837 --> 00:35:25,940
[SPEAKER_12]: PS 178, Woburn Street, Medford, resident, 50 years.

339
00:35:27,281 --> 00:35:30,824
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wondering, how many complaints have you received about leaf blowers?

340
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:35,928
[SPEAKER_02]: in like me personally or the city?

341
00:35:35,948 --> 00:35:38,609
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering how many complaints they received.

342
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,753
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've certainly received many in my personal capacity and as a Councilor, I don't know.

343
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:44,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have a number?

344
00:35:44,994 --> 00:35:47,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Commissioner, do we have a statistic on that?

345
00:35:47,936 --> 00:35:49,136
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't have a statistic on that.

346
00:35:49,156 --> 00:35:49,136
1,000, 2,000, 10,000?

347
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:50,217
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have a statistic.

348
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:54,800
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it's 10,000 and we have 76,000 residents in Medford, I believe as far as 2022, then 66,000 of them haven't complained?

349
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:06,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know how many people will be filing individual complaints.

350
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:14,029
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just saying you're going off the complaints, but you're also going off maybe 66,000 people that haven't complained in Medford.

351
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:16,629
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just a thought.

352
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,590
[SPEAKER_12]: You're going off who's calling in.

353
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,691
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot more residents than probably the complaints that are coming in.

354
00:36:21,711 --> 00:36:26,972
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say I've been landscaping here with my family.

355
00:36:27,112 --> 00:36:28,132
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a family business.

356
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:29,953
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been here.

357
00:36:31,198 --> 00:36:33,421
[SPEAKER_12]: over 30 years with my father working in Medford.

358
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,162
[SPEAKER_12]: We come into a cleanup.

359
00:36:35,863 --> 00:36:37,825
[SPEAKER_12]: I have generally 12 to 14 guys with me.

360
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:41,089
[SPEAKER_12]: I have at least six to seven of them raking up leaves first.

361
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:50,880
[SPEAKER_12]: For people in Medford that maybe can take care of themselves, but don't have the time, or I have older customers, how do you expect them to clean up their places after all this is done?

362
00:36:51,707 --> 00:36:52,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand, yes.

363
00:36:53,028 --> 00:36:54,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Put them in your beds, it's more degradable.

364
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,791
[SPEAKER_12]: But not everybody can do this.

365
00:36:56,572 --> 00:37:00,095
[SPEAKER_12]: Buildup of leaves also causes insects, mosquitoes, moisture.

366
00:37:00,256 --> 00:37:02,017
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are other things to think about as well.

367
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:08,884
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I do come into a cleanup, that's what I'm saying.

368
00:37:09,745 --> 00:37:10,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Springtime.

369
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,302
[SPEAKER_12]: We're using blowers just to do a final cleanup on the properties themselves.

370
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:19,104
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything is picked up, loaded into a truck.

371
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:22,225
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't use any leaf suckers during the springtime.

372
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:23,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we do them during the fall?

373
00:37:24,206 --> 00:37:24,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

374
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:33,911
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's not, I have guys climbing trucks with heavy bags of leaves or canvases to dump into a truck, which is dangerous.

375
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:35,372
[SPEAKER_12]: The leaf suckers, yes.

376
00:37:35,592 --> 00:37:36,352
[SPEAKER_12]: Do they have noise?

377
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I run them when I pick up the leaves, and that's how we run it.

378
00:37:40,054 --> 00:37:41,975
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been doing this for a long time.

379
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:44,918
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we use electric batteries in other cities.

380
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:56,026
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to use that during the summertime, I have no problem with that, but you're still not taking into the fact what it takes to make an electric battery and to get rid of an electric battery.

381
00:37:58,127 --> 00:38:07,674
[SPEAKER_12]: The phase-out, I'm just wondering, could you tell me what that phase-out was of, was it all gas blowers, all leaf blowers for commercial operators by 2026, so in two years?

382
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,122
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gas by 2026, but electric would still be year round allowed.

383
00:38:14,863 --> 00:38:19,605
[SPEAKER_12]: So you're trying to phase out all gas blowers in two years from Medford?

384
00:38:19,625 --> 00:38:25,448
[SPEAKER_02]: For commercial operators and owners of large property, and then four years for the average resident and for the city.

385
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:29,650
[SPEAKER_12]: How do you expect us to clean this up?

386
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,392
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, do you expect us to go out with rakes?

387
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:34,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you going to call the city and have all the

388
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:39,608
[SPEAKER_12]: The residents come down and just start raking everything for everybody.

389
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:41,609
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand how you're gonna phase out gas.

390
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:45,932
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll ask anybody, and if somebody can answer, how did you get here tonight?

391
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:49,554
[SPEAKER_12]: You walked, great.

392
00:38:50,174 --> 00:38:51,075
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody else take a car?

393
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:53,696
[SPEAKER_12]: So you use a car to get to work.

394
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:59,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, we have 76,000 residents, I believe, in Medford, maybe you can correct me on that.

395
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,921
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a building going up down past Wegmans for 350 apartments.

396
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Next block over, 350 more apartments.

397
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:11,791
[SPEAKER_12]: How many cars do we have driving through the city every year that you're talking about pollution?

398
00:39:12,612 --> 00:39:14,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you hear any blowers now this time of year?

399
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:18,575
[SPEAKER_12]: You hear blowers in the springtime and the falltime.

400
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:23,318
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking about pollution.

401
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:25,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Look at the city every single day.

402
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,583
[SPEAKER_12]: And now you're going to take one person, one group of people, and what's next?

403
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:32,404
[SPEAKER_12]: My lawnmowers?

404
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:34,165
[SPEAKER_12]: The residents' lawnmowers?

405
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:41,193
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to think beyond everything that else is going on just in this room here.

406
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,158
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not fair to the people that are out there.

407
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:47,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, business owner for how long in the city?

408
00:39:48,604 --> 00:39:51,469
[SPEAKER_12]: A long time, probably longer than most people have been in the city here.

409
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:04,177
[SPEAKER_12]: For us to put EV batteries and to get a trailer ready is $75,000 for one trailer to keep it running a day.

410
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:06,999
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I have two cutting crews.

411
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,061
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in Medford only one day a week.

412
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:10,923
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I have to do, spend $150,000 as a small company?

413
00:40:14,426 --> 00:40:26,394
[SPEAKER_12]: to set this up, so I have all of these batteries that, again, how they're being made, and it takes so many resources to make a battery, and then where are they being disposed of?

414
00:40:26,694 --> 00:40:29,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they being disposed of correctly after we drop them off?

415
00:40:30,036 --> 00:40:32,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I've heard of people saying they're being dropped in the ocean.

416
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:35,500
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's a million things that need to be looked at here.

417
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,485
[SPEAKER_12]: A phase-out, I mean, you just don't want landscapers in Medford in two years, because that's what you have, and if that's what you want,

418
00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:47,878
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it'll change within two years, but we'll see.

419
00:40:48,518 --> 00:40:59,948
[SPEAKER_12]: But phasing this out in two years, I don't know how you expect the city on electric to clean the amount of leaves and the amount of landscapers that are here that help clean up leaves from the city.

420
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:01,529
[SPEAKER_12]: They keep the basins clean.

421
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,391
[SPEAKER_12]: We clean up along the streets.

422
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,333
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't blow them into the streets and leave them.

423
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:13,795
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you've seen fall time here where homeowners, they take their leaves when they know that the leaf suckers come in, and you have all these leaves pushed out into the street.

424
00:41:14,416 --> 00:41:17,396
[SPEAKER_12]: I've seen years where those leaves are pushed out in the street, and then it snows.

425
00:41:18,637 --> 00:41:20,057
[SPEAKER_12]: And then kids are making food in them.

426
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:22,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And what are you going to do?

427
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:23,578
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody come by and plows?

428
00:41:23,978 --> 00:41:25,859
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, that's what's going to happen.

429
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:28,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Now we're going to have leaves pushed out to the street by every homeowner.

430
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,262
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to have to be tried to be cleaned up by sweet streepers, which the sweet streepers, what time do they run?

431
00:41:36,735 --> 00:41:41,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you mind, does anybody know what time a street cleaner runs?

432
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:44,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them at night, some of them during the big sweep all day.

433
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:45,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Night, what do you consider night?

434
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:51,420
[SPEAKER_12]: All night long, you hear them at four in the morning, you hear them at three in the morning, so does that stop?

435
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,021
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that wakes me up, I know they're running outside.

436
00:41:55,521 --> 00:41:58,623
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, you're picking on one group of people now.

437
00:42:00,683 --> 00:42:02,584
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're gonna phase this out, again,

438
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:12,020
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm fortunate in other towns that the residents are actually, I don't even live in those towns, but they're actually fighting for the landscapers.

439
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:16,602
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't see that many people here fighting for us.

440
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:20,523
[SPEAKER_12]: I just hear people trying to tell us what we can do with our businesses.

441
00:42:22,004 --> 00:42:23,744
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't think it's fair what you're doing.

442
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:26,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think you've thought enough about it.

443
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:32,107
[SPEAKER_12]: I support 14 people that work for us.

444
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,701
[SPEAKER_12]: 17 including my family.

445
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:40,084
[SPEAKER_12]: So they have been with us and they are, these people are my family.

446
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:46,989
[SPEAKER_12]: My workers have been with me for probably 12 to 20 years, because we treat them with respect, they treat us with respect.

447
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,110
[SPEAKER_12]: So what am I gonna do?

448
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:58,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Raise the cost of my work, and then my customers can't afford us, because I think we're pretty reasonable as we are now, and then we get pushed out.

449
00:42:58,296 --> 00:43:01,298
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think there's more conversation to be had here.

450
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:07,145
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't mind doing the dates that you have now, but phasing us out, that's not right.

451
00:43:07,925 --> 00:43:08,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

452
00:43:09,246 --> 00:43:09,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

453
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:13,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go to Zoom.

454
00:43:13,448 --> 00:43:21,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna go to who I think is Harold McGilvery.

455
00:43:21,711 --> 00:43:23,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

456
00:43:23,232 --> 00:43:25,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologies if it's not you, Harry.

457
00:43:26,613 --> 00:43:27,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, can you hear me?

458
00:43:28,534 --> 00:43:29,214
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear you.

459
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address for the record, please.

460
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:32,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Harry McGilvery, 4 Piedmont Road.

461
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I, uh, I support Mr. Kiss and the landscapers.

462
00:43:38,022 --> 00:43:40,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this is a real, a real, uh, overreach.

463
00:43:42,284 --> 00:44:01,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm not quite sure how eliminating this, uh, these leaf blowers are gonna save the environment when, when everybody else joins, joins in this endeavor and different countries around the world start, you know,

464
00:44:02,549 --> 00:44:13,098
[SPEAKER_04]: using the same regulations that are used in the United States, then maybe it will have an impact, but I'm not seeing a significant impact by this resolution for the environment.

465
00:44:13,658 --> 00:44:16,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, lithium batteries are extremely dangerous.

466
00:44:16,661 --> 00:44:22,745
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last year, I have investigated four fires in the city that are directly related to lithium batteries.

467
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:31,332
[SPEAKER_04]: I, for one, would not be comfortable having a lithium battery in my attached garage

468
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:37,520
[SPEAKER_04]: because I just don't think they're safe, nevermind the fact that you can't dispose of them.

469
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,142
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, they're not environmentally friendly to dispose of.

470
00:44:42,243 --> 00:44:45,826
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just, this is a reach.

471
00:44:46,246 --> 00:44:56,874
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how I can go purchase something off a shelf at a hardware store and then the city of Medford can tell me that I can't use that product on my property.

472
00:44:57,835 --> 00:45:00,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I have gas leaf blower, I have a gas weed whacker,

473
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a gas lawnmower, I have a gas snowblower.

474
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:17,679
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with everything Mr. Cass said, and I sympathize with him, that the city of Medford is doing this to him and his family.

475
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:18,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

476
00:45:21,723 --> 00:45:22,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. McGilvery.

477
00:45:22,644 --> 00:45:25,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to Mr. Castagnetti.

478
00:45:25,786 --> 00:45:27,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

479
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Councilor Bears.

480
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:34,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we on?

481
00:45:34,986 --> 00:45:35,526
[SPEAKER_02]: You are on.

482
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please, Mr. Castagnetti.

483
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:42,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew P. Castagnetti, Christian Street, East Medford, Mass.

484
00:45:47,112 --> 00:45:52,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the Chair, I'm asking all the Councilors that are present and should be present

485
00:45:53,044 --> 00:46:02,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any intentions of going after the lawnmowers and snowmobiles, excuse me, snowblowers?

486
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:07,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, this is just an ordinance regarding leaf blowers.

487
00:46:10,651 --> 00:46:11,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

488
00:46:11,651 --> 00:46:19,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a hardship for some of these lawn care peoples and it's going to cost the consumers more.

489
00:46:19,515 --> 00:46:20,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

490
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:29,972
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember on my honeymoon way back in lovely San Francisco, when it was nice, I used to be waking to 6 a.m.

491
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:35,274
[SPEAKER_01]: at the hotel by the leaf blowers, and it was not nice to my ears.

492
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:41,437
[SPEAKER_01]: And plus, the dust is bad for my nostrils, along with cigarette smoke, of course.

493
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,741
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no further comments about this.

494
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:46,901
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take the fifth.

495
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:52,443
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you don't go after our Second Amendment rights to carry firearms.

496
00:46:53,263 --> 00:46:53,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Good night.

497
00:46:55,584 --> 00:46:57,965
[SPEAKER_02]: That is certainly regulated above our level.

498
00:46:58,045 --> 00:46:58,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Cassidy.

499
00:46:58,805 --> 00:46:59,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

500
00:47:01,746 --> 00:47:05,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Giglio on zoom name and address for the record, please.

501
00:47:07,651 --> 00:47:09,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, this is Bill Giglio on Monmouth Street.

502
00:47:10,492 --> 00:47:13,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I am also in support with Scott Cass.

503
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:15,155
[SPEAKER_07]: He does a wonderful job around the city.

504
00:47:15,695 --> 00:47:24,579
[SPEAKER_07]: We just heard three people, George Scarpelli, the last caller Harry, and Mr. Cass talk about the dangers of the lithium batteries.

505
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Has any one of you looked into that on the council here and what have you found about the dangers of getting rid of a lithium battery?

506
00:47:36,724 --> 00:47:40,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts or comments on lithium batteries from members of the council?

507
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:45,788
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's fair to say it's something we've discussed.

508
00:47:47,129 --> 00:47:47,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

509
00:47:50,050 --> 00:48:01,496
[SPEAKER_07]: So you haven't even looked into probably one of the major aspects of doing this, but you're ready to implement them and get rid of one aspect, but you have another aspect where you're

510
00:48:02,436 --> 00:48:10,739
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be hurting the environment severely because they have, you know, because of the dangers of getting rid of these and the dangers of like the last caller said about starting fires.

511
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:12,859
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have, you guys have not looked into that at all?

512
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,700
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I just said that we did actually.

513
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And what did you find?

514
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:30,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we found that it's still worthwhile to put forward this ordinance that is targeted at specifically two-stroke engines, which are known to be one of the most polluting types.

515
00:48:31,061 --> 00:48:32,301
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, that's not what I asked.

516
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:37,122
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked, what did you, what did you, what information did you find about getting rid of lithium batteries?

517
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:40,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Of the dangers of getting rid of lithium batteries?

518
00:48:40,043 --> 00:48:41,503
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my, that's my direct question.

519
00:48:42,523 --> 00:48:44,944
[SPEAKER_02]: You can recycle them at Home Depot.

520
00:48:44,964 --> 00:48:45,744
[SPEAKER_02]: They're recyclable.

521
00:48:46,484 --> 00:48:47,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, and then what do they do?

522
00:48:47,584 --> 00:48:49,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what, what do they do?

523
00:48:50,645 --> 00:48:51,945
[SPEAKER_02]: They turn them into new batteries.

524
00:48:57,026 --> 00:48:59,927
[SPEAKER_07]: And what, what dangers have you found with the lithium batteries?

525
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:02,172
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell them at the store.

526
00:49:03,493 --> 00:49:05,654
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm glad it's funny to you.

527
00:49:06,434 --> 00:49:06,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

528
00:49:12,777 --> 00:49:14,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Councilor Scarpelli.

529
00:49:15,399 --> 00:49:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just, I've done a little research on lithium batteries and, you know, uh,

530
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:29,524
[SPEAKER_06]: There is, you know, a huge, you know, question about them.

531
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:44,413
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're talking about lithium batteries and what they contain, the metals and cobalts and nickels and the contaminants, they contaminate water supplies and the ecosystem if they leach out of landfills, because that's how they're truly disposed.

532
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:48,095
[SPEAKER_06]: We could drop them off at Home Depot, but then they go to a landfill.

533
00:49:48,815 --> 00:49:57,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And the biggest thing that we're hearing right now is what Officer McGover did say, is that they do cause a lot of fires.

534
00:49:57,566 --> 00:50:04,874
[SPEAKER_06]: You're seeing that more and more as they're demanded more and more in our communities.

535
00:50:09,477 --> 00:50:12,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I did do a little, I did do some homework on the lithium battery.

536
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:22,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's something that as I get more involved with understanding, you know, our environmental needs and footprints, I think that, you know,

537
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:33,799
[SPEAKER_06]: The comparison that studies have shown is that we'll see more damage to our environment in the future, in the long run.

538
00:50:35,419 --> 00:50:42,321
[SPEAKER_06]: The measurements can't be apples to apples, because this is something that's at its infancy.

539
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:45,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll see it later in life.

540
00:50:45,482 --> 00:50:50,104
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's what is keeping me from moving forward with this.

541
00:50:50,524 --> 00:50:53,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And the particulates in the air,

542
00:50:55,906 --> 00:50:59,008
[SPEAKER_06]: You could, you know, you could, you could debate that as well.

543
00:50:59,108 --> 00:51:02,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So how it's, how it's blown and how it's managed.

544
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:19,181
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at, you know, putting in some standards in place, people like the cast family, they make sure they are respectful to the community and they're respectful in how they're disposing and using these products.

545
00:51:19,902 --> 00:51:24,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some aren't, some companies don't do that, but you know, that's more of, um,

546
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:41,531
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the piece of enforcement, which, um, I know we have, we have our, um, we have our, um, building inspectors and our, our code enforcement inspectors going through their, um, going through their contract.

547
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:49,374
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would recommend that our new director re commissioner reaches out to their, his team and in negotiations, they should really, um,

548
00:51:51,184 --> 00:52:12,014
[SPEAKER_06]: enlighten their enforcement officers that this is coming down the line because this isn't going to be easy this to add this to their plate again there's another reason that i find it you know um listen i know i know it's inconvenient for people because some people do take advantage of it and they could be loud but for the most part

549
00:52:13,112 --> 00:52:23,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, the conversations that I've had with residents, it really, you know, it's, it's, it's, it really doesn't make a difference.

550
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,764
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't, I haven't heard a groundswell of changing an ordinance or implementing an ordinance for this.

551
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:40,612
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but again, I, I, I respect my colleagues and, and the, the, the evolution of this process, but, um, um, just wanted to share what, what I've learned.

552
00:52:40,692 --> 00:52:40,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

553
00:52:42,802 --> 00:52:47,627
[SPEAKER_02]: And Councilor Scarpelli, go to Ellen on Zoom.

554
00:52:48,387 --> 00:52:50,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

555
00:52:54,413 --> 00:52:56,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Ellen Lavecchia, 27 Ramsehead Road.

556
00:53:00,299 --> 00:53:01,139
[SPEAKER_09]: Just three points.

557
00:53:03,602 --> 00:53:04,182
[SPEAKER_09]: One is,

558
00:53:06,676 --> 00:53:32,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Have we, sorry if I missed this in the beginning, have we reached out to increase the budget for the, I don't know what the line item's called, but the maintenance for Oak Grove and all of the city properties, all of the schools and any other city owned property retained where leaves need to be removed.

559
00:53:33,459 --> 00:53:43,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know what the increase in cost will be to the city since it will take, you know, other people, landscapers are the experts here.

560
00:53:43,361 --> 00:53:49,283
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like 2, 3, 4 times the amount of time to do the work that they're doing for us now.

561
00:53:50,323 --> 00:53:53,324
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I guess my 1st question, I do have 2 other comments.

562
00:53:53,384 --> 00:53:54,744
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if you want to just answer that 1st.

563
00:53:56,644 --> 00:54:00,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we'll receive the school committee does the school budget.

564
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:01,772
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an impact on the city.

565
00:54:01,792 --> 00:54:05,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be addressed in the city budget when we receive it.

566
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:09,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Passing this or not potentially passing this without knowing what that number is.

567
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:15,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the city will work around what the legal requirements are to make sure that it keeps the property.

568
00:54:15,843 --> 00:54:16,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

569
00:54:16,203 --> 00:54:23,108
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's no problem to find money for this, but we don't have money for a lot of other things we need in our city.

570
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:23,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

571
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:25,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what you just told me.

572
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:26,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause they'll, they'll work around it.

573
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:28,733
[SPEAKER_09]: So that money comes out of thin air.

574
00:54:28,773 --> 00:54:29,393
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

575
00:54:29,473 --> 00:54:30,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.

576
00:54:30,974 --> 00:54:33,336
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that can be the answer for other things as well.

577
00:54:33,777 --> 00:54:37,980
[SPEAKER_09]: So on to my second point, um,

578
00:54:40,726 --> 00:54:54,374
[SPEAKER_09]: The lithium batteries have been, there's been a lot written about how they are just as detrimental to the environment, the building and disposing of those batteries.

579
00:54:56,215 --> 00:54:59,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, let's not pretend that they're not, because they are.

580
00:54:59,637 --> 00:55:00,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're just trading one.

581
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:02,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the second point.

582
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:09,163
[SPEAKER_09]: The third point, and I'm just going to say it every time I see it in here,

583
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:22,443
[SPEAKER_09]: is I have to state how disgusting the condescension is, how disgusting it is answering people on this call today.

584
00:55:22,463 --> 00:55:29,907
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

585
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:30,987
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go to everyone.

586
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:37,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. McAleary?

587
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?

588
00:55:41,512 --> 00:55:41,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

589
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:43,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Just if you could, it's Terry again, right?

590
00:55:44,114 --> 00:55:44,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

591
00:55:44,554 --> 00:55:44,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

592
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:45,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for letting me speak again.

593
00:55:46,015 --> 00:55:47,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Harry McGill before Piedmont road method.

594
00:55:49,237 --> 00:55:51,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just a couple of quick points.

595
00:55:52,219 --> 00:55:55,321
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned recycling home Depot recycles them.

596
00:55:56,242 --> 00:56:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty known fact that the recycled batteries are more dangerous than the batteries when they're new.

597
00:56:03,407 --> 00:56:08,410
[SPEAKER_04]: For some reason, they, they lose some integrity when they're recycled.

598
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:09,231
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh,

599
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:11,746
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're just more dangerous.

600
00:56:11,766 --> 00:56:31,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if we had a fire chief, he could probably weigh in on this, because I know the fire marshal in Massachusetts issued a warning on lithium batteries, along with the Method Fire Department, after a significant house fire we had in the city that was directly related to a lithium battery.

601
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:35,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, Mr. Kass brought up, I think, a really good point.

602
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:40,927
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, how many complaints are you getting on this?

603
00:56:41,428 --> 00:56:43,749
[SPEAKER_04]: When you say a number, what's a number?

604
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:49,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I think if I'm a city councilor and I'm gonna push,

605
00:56:50,037 --> 00:56:54,820
[SPEAKER_04]: a resolution or a change, try to change something in the city.

606
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:04,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna tell you, yeah, I've had 2,500 residents in the West, I live in West Method, and I don't hear leaf blowers.

607
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:07,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I'm just immune to it or something, like I'm immune to the train tracks.

608
00:57:08,707 --> 00:57:12,109
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would say, yeah, I've had 2,500, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000.

609
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:13,129
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally don't believe

610
00:57:18,274 --> 00:57:20,276
[SPEAKER_04]: that there's that many people complaining about it.

611
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:21,537
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's a small number.

612
00:57:21,637 --> 00:57:26,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's probably less than 500, but we don't have that data.

613
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:28,042
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you not have that data?

614
00:57:28,963 --> 00:57:31,345
[SPEAKER_04]: All I ever hear is the word transparency.

615
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:34,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not being very transparent.

616
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:43,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I would advise the council in the future, tell the people who tell the people how many people are complaining.

617
00:57:44,896 --> 00:57:45,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe in, in,

618
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:49,250
[SPEAKER_04]: In democracy here, yeah.

619
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:51,971
[SPEAKER_04]: If the majority of people want them gone, yeah, then they're gone.

620
00:57:52,772 --> 00:58:06,019
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we're talking about a couple hundred people that are complaining or it's an agenda, you know, because you want to clean the environment and you think that you're going to fix everything right here in the city of Medford, then, you know, let's be honest about it.

621
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:07,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be honest about it.

622
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one of your agenda items.

623
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:10,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

624
00:58:12,643 --> 00:58:13,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

625
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:14,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comments?

626
00:58:15,595 --> 00:58:17,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng then we'll go to Mr. Kears.

627
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:18,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

628
00:58:18,797 --> 00:58:19,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

629
00:58:19,218 --> 00:58:29,645
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's, you know, I want to reiterate Councilor Collins' point that we've talked, we have considered the question of lithium batteries throughout the creation of this process.

630
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:35,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Looking at reports from the EPA, from UPenn, from Wash U in St.

631
00:58:35,669 --> 00:58:37,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Louis, from Yale University.

632
00:58:39,031 --> 00:58:44,594
[SPEAKER_13]: they all ask us to think about, yes, there is an environmental impact to creating batteries and destroying them.

633
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:47,576
[SPEAKER_13]: But we also have to think of the lifetime of that use.

634
00:58:48,156 --> 00:58:53,739
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's not only the inception and the getting rid of the product.

635
00:58:53,819 --> 00:59:04,425
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all the time in between the emissions that are produced in between as well, where gas-powered leaf blowers really do exceed electric.

636
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:09,688
[SPEAKER_13]: battery-powered leaf blowers by quite a bit in terms of emissions.

637
00:59:11,129 --> 00:59:12,430
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to look at the whole picture.

638
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:20,736
[SPEAKER_13]: And while there might be one part of the picture we don't like as much, we should consider the lifetime of the project as well.

639
00:59:22,785 --> 00:59:29,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Very similarly, we shouldn't let this one point dictate the whole debate.

640
00:59:29,367 --> 00:59:44,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I would also like to remind the council that a number of us have been working on this ordinance for a while in the public eye, with it being posted on Facebook, with people having chances to chime in in favor and against.

641
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,391
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were re-elected.

642
00:59:46,771 --> 00:59:48,311
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a representative democracy.

643
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:50,952
[SPEAKER_13]: And we were elected by a majority of the voters.

644
00:59:54,804 --> 00:59:55,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

645
00:59:55,266 --> 00:59:55,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

646
00:59:57,636 --> 00:59:58,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

647
00:59:58,741 --> 00:59:59,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

648
00:59:59,122 --> 00:59:59,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

649
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:02,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just wanted to add to that.

650
01:00:03,192 --> 01:00:10,756
[SPEAKER_08]: But in addition to there being plenty of studies showing that over the life of the product, it is environmentally more responsible to use electric.

651
01:00:11,496 --> 01:00:16,878
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be noted that battery technology changes and changes fairly quickly.

652
01:00:17,338 --> 01:00:25,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we're talking about lithium batteries, the design of an electric leaf blower is different from the design of a gas powered leaf blower.

653
01:00:26,262 --> 01:00:26,603
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we

654
01:00:27,603 --> 01:00:44,251
[SPEAKER_08]: convert now to electric as battery technology improves, we will be able to more easily get the benefit of those new batteries, which, you know, I'm sure will be environmentally more sustainable because people are not quite aware of the problems with lithium batteries.

655
01:00:46,112 --> 01:00:48,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Callahan, Mr. Kearse, and then I'm going to go back to Zoom.

656
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:52,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Patrick, here's again, 178 Woburn Street.

657
01:00:53,124 --> 01:00:54,667
[SPEAKER_12]: You said you've looked into batteries.

658
01:00:55,108 --> 01:00:58,316
[SPEAKER_12]: What are the resources that it takes to make one electric battery?

659
01:01:02,421 --> 01:01:02,881
[SPEAKER_12]: No, you didn't.

660
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,924
[SPEAKER_12]: What resources does it take to make one?

661
01:01:05,944 --> 01:01:07,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer we not get into a back and forth, thank you.

662
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:09,106
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a back and forth.

663
01:01:09,146 --> 01:01:10,327
[SPEAKER_12]: He's saying he answered the question.

664
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:14,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone knows the pound amounts of metals or electrical.

665
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:22,076
[SPEAKER_12]: 25,000 pounds of brine for the lithium, 30,000 pounds for the ore for the cobalt, 5,000 pounds for the ore of the nickel, 25,000 pounds for the ore of the copper, digging up 500,000 pounds of the Earth's crust.

666
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:39,353
[SPEAKER_12]: You're telling me that maybe because this is being done in other countries, it's not being made here, that we don't have to worry about this.

667
01:01:39,813 --> 01:01:48,457
[SPEAKER_12]: You talk about the environment, one electric battery, 500,000 pounds of the earth's crust is dug up.

668
01:01:48,677 --> 01:01:49,738
[SPEAKER_02]: How big is the battery?

669
01:01:50,898 --> 01:01:52,059
[SPEAKER_12]: One EV battery.

670
01:01:52,439 --> 01:01:53,340
[SPEAKER_02]: For an electric vehicle?

671
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:53,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

672
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:54,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

673
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So much bigger than what we're talking about here.

674
01:01:57,611 --> 01:02:00,853
[SPEAKER_12]: So, okay, so cut it in half.

675
01:02:01,313 --> 01:02:04,635
[SPEAKER_12]: 250,000 pounds of digging up the earth's crust for a smaller battery.

676
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:07,216
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the source, if you don't mind me asking?

677
01:02:07,617 --> 01:02:08,517
[SPEAKER_12]: You can look it up right here.

678
01:02:08,717 --> 01:02:11,138
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll give you the source after the meeting, but it's right here.

679
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:13,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have the name of the source?

680
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,761
[SPEAKER_12]: If I had my glasses, sorry.

681
01:02:18,222 --> 01:02:21,024
[SPEAKER_12]: You can look it up on vitalmix.com.

682
01:02:21,364 --> 01:02:22,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

683
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,347
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, one of the people that was on

684
01:02:27,642 --> 01:02:32,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Zoom, she mentioned the cost of cleaning up for Medford.

685
01:02:32,726 --> 01:02:37,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, does anybody here know what the cost is for cleaning up the Oak Grove Cemetery for one season?

686
01:02:42,793 --> 01:02:46,495
[SPEAKER_12]: You look really happy over there, look pretty bored.

687
01:02:47,956 --> 01:02:48,657
[SPEAKER_12]: So nobody knows.

688
01:02:49,577 --> 01:02:54,661
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe for just the Oak Grove Cemetery, it is $80,000 to clean the Oak Grove Cemetery.

689
01:02:57,677 --> 01:03:03,299
[SPEAKER_12]: So you expect to clean that cemetery with electric batteries.

690
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:09,920
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I could bring out my blow dryer and it's gonna create more air than an electric battery, all the same.

691
01:03:10,641 --> 01:03:15,322
[SPEAKER_12]: So that whole cemetery now needs to be raked up and tried to be cleaned.

692
01:03:15,902 --> 01:03:18,883
[SPEAKER_12]: That cost will go up four times that amount.

693
01:03:19,903 --> 01:03:23,224
[SPEAKER_12]: And please, you can get back to me on the number of what it is to clean up it.

694
01:03:23,464 --> 01:03:26,125
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do believe that's the number, because I've been approached about it before.

695
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:35,023
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't think, you know, you quote all these things, but I think there's more information out there that needs to be going through.

696
01:03:35,543 --> 01:03:37,285
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I'm not complaining.

697
01:03:37,585 --> 01:03:44,892
[SPEAKER_12]: I will go with the months that you give me for using a gas blower to clean up leaves, but you have to be reasonable on your side as well.

698
01:03:47,334 --> 01:03:50,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Phasing out gas blowers in two years, it's impossible.

699
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:55,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Impossible for the city and for homeowners to clean up.

700
01:03:57,352 --> 01:03:59,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that needs to be taken into consideration.

701
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:05,537
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll be honest with you, I feel like I talk here, but it's only gonna be happening what you guys think.

702
01:04:07,138 --> 01:04:11,802
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I'm gonna ask this question, you can tell me if they can answer the question.

703
01:04:12,142 --> 01:04:13,182
[SPEAKER_12]: How many votes did you get?

704
01:04:13,202 --> 01:04:16,705
[SPEAKER_12]: If you don't mind me asking.

705
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, that'd be great if you want to.

706
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked the question last night and nobody could answer it.

707
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:28,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I got about 7,500 Councilor Collins and saying we're a little over 7,000.

708
01:04:29,563 --> 01:04:35,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lazzaro and Callahan were in the 6,000s as long as Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Leming was around 5,800.

709
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:46,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's also pretty much the highest amount that's happened in a recent municipal election for council seats.

710
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,071
[SPEAKER_12]: He said that he was voted in.

711
01:04:48,612 --> 01:04:52,634
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm getting to my point, if you'll let me answer it.

712
01:04:52,674 --> 01:04:53,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not go with the back and forth.

713
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:55,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro and Mr. Kearse.

714
01:04:55,797 --> 01:04:57,798
[SPEAKER_12]: So you were voted in with those votes.

715
01:04:57,818 --> 01:04:58,238
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

716
01:04:58,298 --> 01:04:58,999
[SPEAKER_12]: I voted too.

717
01:04:59,659 --> 01:05:01,200
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, 7,500 votes.

718
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:03,762
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm blaming the city.

719
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:04,843
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm blaming the residents.

720
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:06,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying I'm blaming them.

721
01:05:06,924 --> 01:05:08,185
[SPEAKER_12]: You got 7,500 votes out of 76,000 people.

722
01:05:10,367 --> 01:05:11,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe 76,000 about 60,000 people 60,000 voters.

723
01:05:11,769 --> 01:05:12,951
[SPEAKER_12]: There's 40,000 registered voters and it's we that was

724
01:05:18,416 --> 01:05:19,477
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I'm blaming the residents.

725
01:05:19,497 --> 01:05:20,658
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not saying anything towards that.

726
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:24,821
[SPEAKER_12]: But maybe a lot of the residents just don't know what's going on in the city, is what I'm saying.

727
01:05:25,782 --> 01:05:31,406
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the highest number of votes for people on the school committee and city council since we switched to plan A government in 1987.

728
01:05:31,546 --> 01:05:32,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, that's great.

729
01:05:32,447 --> 01:05:33,288
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the highest number.

730
01:05:33,328 --> 01:05:37,031
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm saying, though, it's 7,500 to 60,000 or 40,000 voters.

731
01:05:37,651 --> 01:05:39,773
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just making a fact.

732
01:05:39,833 --> 01:05:41,554
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm not saying anything about how you got voted in.

733
01:05:41,935 --> 01:05:45,397
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm saying it's the residents that maybe don't know what's going on in the city.

734
01:05:46,539 --> 01:05:48,641
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, I'm trying to work with this leaf bowl.

735
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:50,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand the noise pollution.

736
01:05:52,424 --> 01:05:53,866
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry if this has given you a headache.

737
01:05:53,986 --> 01:06:00,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we all worked and spent in sums of money and raised money to try to encourage more people to vote.

738
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we'd all be very happy if more people did.

739
01:06:02,313 --> 01:06:08,659
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to Anthony on Zoom.

740
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:15,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I am Rebecca 27 Ram said road method.

741
01:06:16,292 --> 01:06:19,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question out of the seven of you sitting behind the real right now.

742
01:06:20,395 --> 01:06:24,078
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you use lithium batteries on a daily basis?

743
01:06:25,079 --> 01:06:27,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would guess the answer is zero.

744
01:06:28,161 --> 01:06:33,866
[SPEAKER_03]: The average lifespan of a lithium battery because I daily basis is 12 months.

745
01:06:35,107 --> 01:06:37,229
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can get 14 out of them doing good.

746
01:06:38,593 --> 01:06:43,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's all get your head out of the cab, Doug, for the six of you.

747
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,682
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to realize we are here.

748
01:06:46,863 --> 01:06:48,825
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand we need to do something.

749
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:58,176
[SPEAKER_03]: But eliminating this in the cost that it's going to incur to the city, for the schools, for the people that barely can afford their houses now.

750
01:06:59,344 --> 01:07:04,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not gonna clean up and the leaves are great on the grass and all that.

751
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:05,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

752
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:08,073
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a huge rat problem in the city of Medford.

753
01:07:08,433 --> 01:07:11,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess where they like to live under leaves and stuff like that.

754
01:07:14,499 --> 01:07:16,361
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are we dealing with that?

755
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:19,023
[SPEAKER_03]: No one can answer it.

756
01:07:19,384 --> 01:07:24,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's an agenda item that you want to check and say, Yes, we're going to do this.

757
01:07:24,886 --> 01:07:33,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the building department really have the time or the money to sit there and take an inventory of Pat's leaf blowing equipment?

758
01:07:33,951 --> 01:07:36,952
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's only one person toughs another person.

759
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:41,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, let's be real about this whole thing.

760
01:07:42,135 --> 01:07:43,735
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to do it right, do it right.

761
01:07:43,916 --> 01:07:46,757
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't just put things in to make yourself feel good.

762
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:50,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

763
01:07:56,233 --> 01:07:58,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further comment by members of the public?

764
01:08:00,856 --> 01:08:04,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Any comment from or any motions from members of the council?

765
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:06,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

766
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Bears.

767
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:12,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for everybody who's spoken tonight and in previous meetings for and against.

768
01:08:13,885 --> 01:08:24,118
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I can only speak for myself as one Councilor, this isn't the project that I initiated it was initiated by former President Morell know that all of our projects come out of constituent feedback.

769
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,564
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, from one form or another, this is one of those projects.

770
01:08:30,566 --> 01:08:40,814
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I think that this project is really the product of compromise, like a lot of like almost like every single one of our ordinances and resolutions and projects in this chambers.

771
01:08:41,754 --> 01:08:52,563
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we've worked hard to get from our starting point, which I think was much more onerous based on, you know, examples that we found in other neighboring cities to try to get this to

772
01:08:53,843 --> 01:08:56,085
[SPEAKER_11]: a place that was a better fit for our community.

773
01:08:56,765 --> 01:09:06,250
[SPEAKER_11]: We've made several I think pretty major adjustments to make sure that the balance of restrictions on commercial operators and residential users was more appropriate to make sure

774
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:22,778
[SPEAKER_11]: that, you know, anything that was expected of commercial operators would also be expected by municipal contractors and, you know, essentially to say we have a tool here, we have the appetite here to, we're hearing from constituents that we want this

775
01:09:24,039 --> 01:09:30,665
[SPEAKER_11]: source of noise pollution to be, you know, to have a lever to pull to make sure that that's at a reasonable level at reasonable times.

776
01:09:31,106 --> 01:09:47,681
[SPEAKER_11]: And we want to take this technology, which is known to be one of the most polluting, you know, I don't think anything, anybody expects us to solve global warming in Medford, but we, I think we've, it came from the community that we have the opportunity to take action on something that is known to be especially polluting and say, let's

777
01:09:48,530 --> 01:09:50,212
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, let's start to rein that in.

778
01:09:50,912 --> 01:09:54,516
[SPEAKER_11]: And this has been a public process to create a timeline.

779
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:56,918
[SPEAKER_11]: For that we've gotten a lot of feedback on it.

780
01:09:57,999 --> 01:10:07,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Coming out of that we have this draft that we further amended tonight after the feedback from our new building commissioner, city staff, and legal counsel.

781
01:10:08,669 --> 01:10:14,174
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to thank all the constituents that have weighed in on this over the past, I think, possibly

782
01:10:15,049 --> 01:10:21,673
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the seventh public meeting on actually the eighth public meeting public meeting over the past eight public meetings on it.

783
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:28,077
[SPEAKER_11]: It's critical for the ordinance project to get, I think that many bites at the apple and that much feedback.

784
01:10:28,097 --> 01:10:32,580
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that, I would motion to report this out of committee as amended.

785
01:10:34,361 --> 01:10:37,423
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion, we need to take the motion to adopt the amendments first.

786
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

787
01:10:38,343 --> 01:10:38,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

788
01:10:38,783 --> 01:10:42,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

789
01:10:44,013 --> 01:10:56,376
[SPEAKER_02]: to adopt the in line amendments of the legal counsel as well as the amendments that you have verbally stated tonight.

790
01:11:02,297 --> 01:11:04,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're ready, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

791
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:10,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

792
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:17,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

793
01:11:17,174 --> 01:11:18,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

794
01:11:19,015 --> 01:11:20,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

795
01:11:21,355 --> 01:11:21,575
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

796
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:24,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

797
01:11:26,597 --> 01:11:32,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, 60 affirmative one of the negative emotion passes their motion from Councilor Collins.

798
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:44,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to report the paper out of committee as amended.

799
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Councilor Callaghan.

800
01:11:47,817 --> 01:11:53,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, my apologies on the motion Councilor Callaghan discussion.

801
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:58,142
[SPEAKER_08]: No, yeah I am seconding but I'd also like to discuss.

802
01:11:58,163 --> 01:11:58,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

803
01:11:58,683 --> 01:11:58,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

804
01:11:59,363 --> 01:12:02,846
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I just want to comment that there have been many public meetings on this.

805
01:12:04,027 --> 01:12:09,731
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been many, there have been dozens of people speaking very eloquently in favor of passing this.

806
01:12:10,712 --> 01:12:20,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally believe that there are more residents in Medford, who are incredibly frustrated with both the noise and pollution of gas leaf blowers than there are

807
01:12:21,079 --> 01:12:27,861
[SPEAKER_08]: people who do not want this ordinance to be this to move out of committee and to move to the City Council for passage.

808
01:12:28,881 --> 01:12:42,885
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also really want to reiterate that the very well respected institutions and scientists in climate science have studied whether

809
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:50,967
[SPEAKER_08]: battery powered leaf blowers or gas powered leaf blowers are which one is environmentally better in the long run.

810
01:12:50,987 --> 01:12:56,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And they have determined that electric powered gas blowers are better for the environment in the long run.

811
01:12:56,949 --> 01:13:04,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And they include all sorts of things in that determination, including the dangers of lithium batteries, including, you know, all the metals that go into those.

812
01:13:05,032 --> 01:13:05,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So

813
01:13:05,652 --> 01:13:11,814
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not need to debate things here and talk about individual metals that go into them because we are not those experts.

814
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:17,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Those experts have come to conclusions and those conclusions are that it's better to use electric.

815
01:13:18,736 --> 01:13:30,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And I certainly do believe that between the environmental impact and the noise pollution, that this is what, passing this is what the majority of Medford's and residents want, which is why I support this.

816
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:32,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.
