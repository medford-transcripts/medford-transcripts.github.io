Mic check, check, two.

5
00:02:35,796 --> 00:02:42,600
This is Medford City Council, Public Health and Community Safety Committee, October 16th, 2024.

6
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:50,124
We are meeting today to discuss a couple of items.

7
00:02:51,465 --> 00:02:53,246
Mr. Clerk, can you please call the roll?

8
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:54,927
Absolutely.

9
00:02:55,888 --> 00:03:00,651
Councilor Callahan, I believe you said you, I believe you said that Councilor Callahan is in traffic.

10
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:01,871
Vice President Collins?

11
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:02,932
Present.

12
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:05,955
Councilwoman?

13
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:07,176
Present.

14
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:08,256
Councilor Seng?

15
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:09,037
Present.

16
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:09,957
Chair Lozaro?

17
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:10,837
Present.

18
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:14,599
Four present, one absent, meeting is called to order.

19
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:17,701
We will be discussing two items today.

20
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:28,585
The first is 22-379 offered by Councilor Seng and Councilor Collins, Resolution of Draft and Ordinance to Secure Rights to Gender Affirming Care.

21
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:49,144
And that will be actually in conjunction with 22-453, which is a former item offered by President Behrs, Vice President Collins, and former Councilor Morrell, resolution to discuss potential ordinances and policies to protect reproductive rights.

22
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:57,030
So these are two items that I will ask

23
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:02,393
Councilor Sang to summarize for us and then we can get started discussing.

24
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:08,198
We have also a draft that Councilor Sang shared with the committee today.

25
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,560
Councilor Sang.

26
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:11,321
Thank you.

27
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,022
Thank you so much.

28
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:13,383
As we know,

29
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:26,197
In the last few years, reproductive rights and gender affirming care, the rights to access those two forms of health care have been particularly at stake in our country.

30
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:38,309
Particularly worrying is that even though we live in a state that does a lot to protect these rights, much of what we're seeing nationally is

31
00:04:39,252 --> 00:05:03,479
requests for municipalities and states to carry out out-of-state orders, so orders that are not from our own state, from authorities not here, to arrest, to get sent information, to prosecute individuals who are seeking or providing gender-affirming care or reproductive health care.

32
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,820
In the context of all of that happening in the country,

33
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:14,728
uh, Councilor Collins and I, as well as President Behrs, then President Morrell, and Councilor Collins.

34
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:32,223
We had a bunch of, um, resolutions on the City Council agenda to have our committee discuss what we can do to best safeguard those rights here, um, in Medford, um, and to make sure that, you know, we're following Massachusetts laws, that we're executing Massachusetts laws, that we're not, um,

35
00:05:33,356 --> 00:05:38,179
putting ourselves in a situation where we're forced to carry out the laws of a state that we don't belong to.

36
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,342
There are a lot of different ways to go about it.

37
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:50,768
The main focus the last time that this committee met on this subject was focusing more on the police involvement with the issue.

38
00:05:51,849 --> 00:06:01,576
And so really honing in on the question of arrests and cooperation in that process and essentially establishing a non-cooperation

39
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:04,784
process.

40
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:08,466
Now, at that meeting, I presented a draft.

41
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:12,327
I think the feedback that I got was mostly that it looked like a good draft.

42
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:18,130
There were some questions that counselors had, some people that counselors wanted me to reach out to.

43
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:29,796
So in the meantime, I updated the draft in responding to those questions, as well as reached out to the health care providers in Medford, notably Tufts and Harvard Vanguard.

44
00:06:30,576 --> 00:06:35,100
I believe Harvard Vanguard was the one that didn't have anyone getting back to us.

45
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:47,571
I tried a bunch of times, but I actually did have a sit down with Tufts Medical and their public affairs team, public policy team, and they were fully in support of us having an ordinance like this.

46
00:06:48,352 --> 00:06:51,054
I think on top of that, it's worth noting that

47
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:55,524
I don't know if all the counselors received this.

48
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,245
This wasn't sent to the council as a whole.

49
00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:03,208
I know this was just on an email list from the top reproductive equity rights group in Massachusetts.

50
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:12,532
They asked that even though there are state measures in place to defend reproductive health care and gender affirming care, they asked

51
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:28,135
municipalities like us to explore ways to stand up for reproductive freedom here in communities like Medford, particularly through ordinances and bylaws.

52
00:07:28,155 --> 00:07:39,263
And so this draft that we have in front of us is essentially an extension of that effort to ensure safe and fair access to reproductive health care and gender equity care.

53
00:07:40,570 --> 00:08:01,750
The draft that we have before us is a slight expansion upon what we had at our last committee meeting, particularly given the second resolution that you read out, which broadens the scope that this committee can work with, and in response to some suggestions from residents and activists in the area as well.

54
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,072
And so what I've done is I've

55
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:28,304
basically recrafted this draft with provisions about their access to information, because one of the other problems a lot of municipalities are seeing, especially with regards to abortion care, is the popping up of anti-abortion clinics, which essentially what they do is they sell themselves as reproductive health clinics, they get

56
00:08:29,264 --> 00:08:32,571
the more vulnerable populations come in to use their services.

57
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:39,283
They don't recommend them for the necessary health care procedures, including abortion, but instead

58
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,309
preach a certain message.

59
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:47,751
And this is of a lot of concern because a lot of this behavior is quite predatory.

60
00:08:48,631 --> 00:09:08,340
And so this is something that a lot of Massachusetts municipalities have started to take action on, to explore ways to put language in their ordinances about fair access, about seeing what we can do to prevent certain centers like this opening up, and to distribute good information, especially in conjunction with our Board of Health.

61
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:17,309
And so essentially that's the draft that we just got that Clark Herbie's just distributed via email and in print to us.

62
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:24,725
I, I wish I had a chance to get to the sooner so we could review the language here.

63
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:44,951
But I was thinking we could, we can take motions at the end, but I was thinking to move that counselors send feedback to chair Lazaro and me before our next public health committee meeting on the ordinance language here, as well as

64
00:09:46,906 --> 00:09:48,808
Well, I'll just let that motion stand there.

65
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:57,395
And then I was thinking maybe we want to discuss who we want to consult further and if we want to send this draft out to anyone.

66
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:01,178
Thank you.

67
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:12,948
I believe we still need a response from a police chief Buckley and the board of health director, Brian O'Connor.

68
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:14,989
I would be happy to reach out to them.

69
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:18,338
I'm not sure if we need a motion for that.

70
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:19,079
Maybe not.

71
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,542
But I can't make that motion anyway.

72
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:25,563
I don't need it.

73
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:26,123
Okay.

74
00:10:27,504 --> 00:10:30,106
So I was just skimming.

75
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:45,096
I'm not sure where in the language, if there is anything in the language that sort of mentions the anti-abortion clinics, or if we have the capacity to put something like that in an ordinance that would prevent

76
00:10:46,254 --> 00:10:54,658
a facility like that from opening, or if we would be able to do something like that, but I would be curious to hear your thoughts on that.

77
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,219
Yeah, I think that's a great question.

78
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:11,686
Essentially, I've gotten a lot of this language from East Hampton, which is kind of the leading municipality on the anti-abortion stuff.

79
00:11:12,626 --> 00:11:15,448
I'm taking a quick skim through now.

80
00:11:17,323 --> 00:11:23,228
I think much of this is what they have regarding those centers.

81
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:31,114
I can study that further, and then if there is a way to do that, I can integrate it into a future draft.

82
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:38,639
It may be something that we want to, when we go line by line on an individual basis and then come back and talk about it, it might be worth

83
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:46,494
looking at, it might just be something I haven't had a chance yet to go through with a fine tooth comb, which is fine.

84
00:11:48,775 --> 00:12:04,597
I also think it might be something that we may have to ask legal about our capacity for what we would be able to, what we can say to a business that wants to come in and what we can't.

85
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:08,278
But anyway, I think this is a great start.

86
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:24,375
I would agree that sending feedback with another meeting and maybe scheduling another meeting that would be probably next month and see if we can get some more solid plans in place at that point would be great.

87
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:25,736
Okay.

88
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:31,861
Are there any other comments from, or do you have more that you want to say?

89
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:36,504
I have more ideas to bounce around just as a committee before I dropped any further language.

90
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:42,107
But if people have comments on this ordinance, let's stay on this for now.

91
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:45,028
Okay.

92
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:46,609
Any further comments from councilors?

93
00:12:49,191 --> 00:12:49,331
No?

94
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:50,952
Okay.

95
00:12:52,413 --> 00:13:05,621
The motion Councilor Sang mentioned was that councilors send feedback to myself and CC Councilor Sang before our next meeting.

96
00:13:05,641 --> 00:13:07,062
Do we have a second?

97
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,190
Second.

98
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,211
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

99
00:13:11,511 --> 00:13:16,713
All those in favor, oh, we lost Councilor, oh, there they are.

100
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:17,353
Speaking of.

101
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,654
I'll just hold on that.

102
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:23,695
As we were saying, we lost Councilor Collins.

103
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,396
She walks in the door.

104
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:27,437
Sorry, there was traffic.

105
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:27,897
I understand.

106
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:28,477
No problem.

107
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:39,410
Would we withdraw the motion so that we can allow for more discussion from the colleagues who just arrived?

108
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:39,510
Yes.

109
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,521
Yes, I will withdraw the motion.

110
00:13:54,861 --> 00:14:03,585
And so just to update the councilors that just arrived, we have been talking about the drafted language.

111
00:14:03,605 --> 00:14:14,709
Do you have the language from Councilor Sang or have you, you may not have had a chance to look it over because it was really fresh.

112
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:17,370
I can give you my copy.

113
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,211
There's some, we have some up here.

114
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:24,024
Trailers are looking through the draft.

115
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:38,554
I do realize that I did actually about the few sentences on Yeah, I did find it so I can I can also redistribute a new copy an updated copy with that Yes, we can also just bundle or motions, yeah Okay, so

116
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:52,016
to review.

117
00:14:53,558 --> 00:15:14,913
Councillor Sang has been going over a summary of where we're at with the ordinances about gender affirming care and reproductive health care in Medford, including non-cooperation of police if there's any outside of Massachusetts entity trying to

118
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,291
enforce laws that are not applicable in Massachusetts?

119
00:15:21,612 --> 00:15:26,754
Any anti-abortion clinics that may be trying to open in Medford?

120
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:28,195
What would be our capacity?

121
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:43,062
We discussed what would be our capacity as a city council to attempt to prevent or enact a rule against a predatory

122
00:15:43,851 --> 00:16:11,928
business like that opening, and these are, we're just at a discussion stage at this point, but Councilor Seng did distribute some language that would be the motion on the floor at the moment is from Councilor Seng, seconded by Councilor Lemming for the members of the committee to review the language as written now, including a couple of sentences that Councilor Seng will add in about the anti-abortion clinics

123
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,782
that are not currently in here, but he will add.

124
00:16:15,563 --> 00:16:27,794
And if you can review the language and send thoughts or edits to myself and see what the councilors are saying before our next meeting, then we can keep moving forward.

125
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:33,959
But it's not, we're not at the stage yet of obviously a line by line review of the ordinance as a committee.

126
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:36,914
Yes, you may.

127
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:49,961
This is just a suggestion, but I'm thinking that perhaps to encourage compliance with the open meeting law, perhaps the edits of the feedback should come to me and I can distribute to the committee.

128
00:16:50,622 --> 00:16:50,982
Thank you.

129
00:16:51,082 --> 00:16:51,762
That would be better.

130
00:16:53,904 --> 00:16:54,384
Yes, please.

131
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:55,084
Please do that.

132
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,766
I would change the motion accordingly.

133
00:16:57,906 --> 00:16:58,546
Thank you.

134
00:16:59,007 --> 00:16:59,447
Please do that.

135
00:16:59,547 --> 00:17:00,007
Yes, yes.

136
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:15,945
I will also reach out to the Director of the Board of Health and the Chief of Police for their feedback on the language thus far, because we haven't heard from them yet.

137
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:31,252
And this is two papers that were in the past two sessions or past session that we're reviewing.

138
00:17:31,352 --> 00:17:32,272
So now you're all up to speed.

139
00:17:33,855 --> 00:17:37,378
Do we have any comments from, yes, Vice President Collins?

140
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:42,561
I'd like to thank Councilor Seng for moving this project forward.

141
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:53,429
I know, as was stated, this is something that the Council has been talking about for a long time, at least since 2022, when I know then President Morrell was one of the voices calling out strongly

142
00:17:53,829 --> 00:18:01,353
to make sure that Medford was doing all it could do to protect reproductive reproductive health care is wonder, as well as gender affirming health care.

143
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:07,017
And of course this is a very new draft and we're going to continue to revise this in committee but just for my initial review.

144
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:08,137
I think that.

145
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:32,696
One of the parts of this that really stands out to me that I hope that residents kind of, that I think is very salient and I hope that residents, you know, hear about and understand in this proposed ordinance is the section and again, like draft section C that says no city resources, materials or funds shall be used to facilitate or aid any person seeking to prohibit criminalized sanction, et cetera, the person seeking this kind of care.

146
00:18:32,716 --> 00:18:34,057
And I think that's really the point to me here.

147
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:44,120
is that we, I think we know implicitly that it's not appropriate for city resources to be used towards such, you know, essentially extra legal purposes.

148
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,401
And that includes the time of our city employees as well.

149
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:53,522
So I'm really proud that we're crafting a policy that enshrines that, and I look forward to continuing to revise this in committee.

150
00:18:58,304 --> 00:18:58,624
Thank you.

151
00:18:59,004 --> 00:18:59,164
Great.

152
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:03,401
On the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

153
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,342
All those in favor?

154
00:19:04,362 --> 00:19:05,382
Aye.

155
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:06,483
All opposed?

156
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,345
The motion passes.

157
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:18,312
The next item for tonight is item 24- Oh, just quickly on that.

158
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:21,034
I know the paper

159
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:31,135
from President Behrs, then President Morrell, and Councilor Collins is quite broad policy-wise on what our committee is authorized to do.

160
00:19:31,196 --> 00:19:34,218
I think this is just one way of thinking about reproductive health rights.

161
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:43,885
I think there are other ways for us to consider, like, I mean, even things as basic as ensuring access to menstrual health products and bathrooms in the city.

162
00:19:44,846 --> 00:19:50,009
So I just wanted to put that out there as something that our committee can discuss while this paper is still in committee.

163
00:19:51,598 --> 00:20:04,517
There's also another thing that activists have reached out to us about potentially drafting an ordinance on is, give me one quick sec.

164
00:20:07,236 --> 00:20:15,161
a local ordinance to ensure pharmacy compliance with the statewide standing order for emergency contraception.

165
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:23,765
And I was wondering if that's something that our committee would be interested in discussing while we have this paper in our committee.

166
00:20:24,586 --> 00:20:28,908
And if so, I can come back to the model ordinance at the next meeting.

167
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:51,642
The question was, would the committee be interested in taking up a paper on ensuring access to enshrining in an ordinance something of pharmacy compliance with maintaining access to emergency contraception?

168
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:52,242
Is that?

169
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:53,603
Yes, emergency contraception.

170
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:59,520
Would that include like Misoprostol, Mifepristone?

171
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,621
I believe so.

172
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:01,062
Yeah.

173
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:01,502
Okay.

174
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:01,923
Yes.

175
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:03,584
So that would be like abortion pills.

176
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:05,066
Yes.

177
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:05,486
Yes.

178
00:21:05,526 --> 00:21:06,767
Councilor Callahan.

179
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:07,408
Just clarification.

180
00:21:07,448 --> 00:21:13,534
So it sounds like this is to ensure that we are in line with state law.

181
00:21:13,614 --> 00:21:17,638
So state law already has changed, and we want to have something explicitly

182
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,158
supporting the state law?

183
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:22,621
So I believe the state, um, the state action is actually via executive order.

184
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:38,193
Um, and so it's just to make sure that we are, um, it's to make sure that we're aligning ourselves with the executive order, but also making sure that if that executive order is reversed one day, um, for God knows what reason, um, we still have the protection in our city.

185
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,974
Thank you.

186
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,033
I see a thumbs up, which is not a spur.

187
00:21:52,914 --> 00:21:55,576
I see a thumbs up.

188
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:58,839
It sounds like there's some interest.

189
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,140
Yes, I mean, I am interested in it from the chair.

190
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,263
I mean, there's like a less of a, I don't know, I can't make a motion.

191
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:08,867
It's a little bit more casual from the chair of the committee.

192
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:11,349
But yes, I mean, I would be interested in doing something like that.

193
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:17,314
I'm curious about, I am still curious about like what our capacity is as a city to

194
00:22:21,293 --> 00:22:34,216
What our capacity is as a city to do anything that wouldn't be already in trend in state law, but I do also think that there is value in affirming something that is right and correct.

195
00:22:34,536 --> 00:22:37,697
So yeah, I would be in favor of discussing it for sure.

196
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:40,438
So I think to that end, yes.

197
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:42,138
Vice President Collins.

198
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,389
Thank you, and sorry, just a clarifying question.

199
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:52,636
I think you already described this, but is the point of that new idea to ensure that pharmacies are complying with providing all of the reproductive health-related medication?

200
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:52,836
Yes.

201
00:22:52,856 --> 00:22:53,997
Okay, cool, great.

202
00:22:54,097 --> 00:23:00,241
I mean, I think that seems part of the theme of these three papers, so I'd be happy to take it up as part of the package.

203
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:12,631
I think so, especially because at a local level, like we have many pharmacies in town, that would be a very localized thing to do, so that makes sense to me.

204
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:23,916
In that case, I'll motion for me to present some draft language for an ordinance before our next meeting to this committee.

205
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:28,337
Would it be something that you would need to present a paper to the regular committee to then have it reviewed?

206
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:33,679
I think it fits under the second paper that you read out.

207
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:39,821
The 22-453 resolution to discuss potential ordinances and policies to protect reproductive rights.

208
00:23:39,861 --> 00:23:40,541
Yeah, beautiful.

209
00:23:40,802 --> 00:23:41,922
It absolutely falls under that.

210
00:23:46,644 --> 00:24:09,395
So on the motion of Councilor Sang to draft language for an ordinance to ensure pharmacy compliance with the state executive order on emergency contraception.

211
00:24:11,456 --> 00:24:12,156
Do we have a second?

212
00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:14,537
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

213
00:24:14,577 --> 00:24:15,258
All those in favor?

214
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:15,738
Aye.

215
00:24:16,417 --> 00:24:16,837
Opposed?

216
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:17,998
Motion passes.

217
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,821
Are we ready to jump to the next paper?

218
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:27,103
Okay.

219
00:24:27,123 --> 00:24:30,004
24-470, offered by Justin Seng, City Councilor.

220
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:35,267
Resolution to discuss the installation of sanitary facilities in public spaces.

221
00:24:37,428 --> 00:24:45,713
Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Public Health and Community Safety Subcommittee meet to consider potential ordinances, policies, and regulations to strengthen the protection

222
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:47,686
Oh, no, that's the wrong one.

223
00:24:48,848 --> 00:24:49,209
I'm sorry.

224
00:24:50,591 --> 00:24:51,172
There's three.

225
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:58,244
Discuss the possibility of installing sanitary facilities and public spaces, including in our parks.

226
00:24:58,745 --> 00:24:59,567
Councillor Sang.

227
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:00,508
Thank you.

228
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:12,652
For this paper, I just wanted to start with a broader conversation about the types of questions we want to be asking, the type of data we might want to collect with regards to this question.

229
00:25:12,672 --> 00:25:14,613
Because I know there's so many different ways to go about it.

230
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:16,733
I know there are a lot of concerns with costs as well.

231
00:25:17,534 --> 00:25:27,097
And so I was thinking it might be good for us to just meet, talk about some general questions we might want to be asking, and then

232
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:35,111
either me or Chair Lozano, we can reach out to department heads and community stakeholders to discuss these questions.

233
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:38,652
We can also create a list of people we might want to invite to a future meeting.

234
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:55,016
I think that one of the first things we'll have to consider is the cost and where, how to begin.

235
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:57,477
Where do we begin?

236
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:00,886
Yes, Councillor Callahan.

237
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:06,709
Councillor Lemming, and then Councillor Callahan.

238
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,051
This is just to add on.

239
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:14,895
I fully agree that the cost of these facilities needs to be determined.

240
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:25,281
Probably also the very basic question of which parks and what would be an ideal number to shoot for across the city.

241
00:26:25,762 --> 00:26:27,863
How many of these facilities do we want to build?

242
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:32,239
Thanks.

243
00:26:32,439 --> 00:26:45,412
So I think in addition to the cost, which is important, I would love to have, you know, either if you have already done some of this research, possibly we do more research into the need in the community.

244
00:26:46,693 --> 00:26:54,501
And, you know, I'm sure you've already thought of this, but we may want to reach out to the Disabilities Commission, we may want to see if we can reach out to

245
00:26:55,888 --> 00:27:05,288
Mothers with newborns and small babies because I just remember from that time period that like finding a bathroom that had a changing space was like absolutely crucial and if I, you know,

246
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:08,236
couldn't find one, it's like very bad.

247
00:27:08,256 --> 00:27:21,984
And maybe we can think of other, you know, groups of people that might have special needs or not even that special, but like, you know, some understanding of what the need is in our community.

248
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:29,349
And I think that would also help us sort of make the case for the cost of these going on.

249
00:27:29,389 --> 00:27:29,449
So.

250
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,111
I would suggest the Medford Family Network would be a good

251
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,251
starting point.

252
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:45,739
I know they even have playgroups in the park, and they go to different parks, and probably they, Miss Andrea, I think, leads those.

253
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,281
I can't remember her last name.

254
00:27:48,241 --> 00:27:52,685
But I'm sure they'll have some feedback about that.

255
00:27:52,845 --> 00:28:01,892
But for sure, probably Medford Family Network, Frances Nwaje, good starting points.

256
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:05,702
Disabilities Commission, yes.

257
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:07,543
Councillor Collins, are you?

258
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:09,203
Is your hand up?

259
00:28:09,663 --> 00:28:10,504
Oh, sure.

260
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:13,425
Just to jump in with, again, preliminary reflections.

261
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:14,385
I agree.

262
00:28:14,425 --> 00:28:18,447
I think this is, you know, obviously there's a lot of groundwork to lay in terms of

263
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:21,191
Should we go forward where?

264
00:28:21,211 --> 00:28:24,914
That's kind of step number one in terms of visioning.

265
00:28:24,974 --> 00:28:29,838
Step number one in terms of implementation would be thinking through those questions of, how would we bring this about?

266
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:30,699
How much would it cost?

267
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:31,720
How much would it cost to build?

268
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:36,604
How much would it cost to maintain, including putting another thing on DPWs?

269
00:28:38,418 --> 00:28:40,079
and using that people power.

270
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:43,580
That's not at all to say that I think we shouldn't do it because it'll take extra resources.

271
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,421
I think that it's a really good idea.

272
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:54,203
I think it's a really nice thing to offer to our residents and visitors to this city and to a lot of residents and visitors, it's also a necessary thing that we should be offering.

273
00:28:54,704 --> 00:29:04,467
And if this is a difficult project to implement, if it could take five to seven years to put together, maybe it'll take shorter, but maybe it'll take five years to put together.

274
00:29:05,768 --> 00:29:11,093
the will and the buy-in and the plans and the money to make this sustainable, then it is good that we're starting now.

275
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:12,034
Thank you.

276
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:27,982
It's just a question for Councillor saying what resident when you're putting this forward, what resident complaints were you specifically responding to?

277
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:32,486
Was it folks that were visiting certain parks who wanted this?

278
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:37,891
What was, could you just talk a little bit about the feedback you were getting that led to this?

279
00:29:38,393 --> 00:29:47,117
I think some specific parts were mentioned, but it was more of a general conversation that I was having, particularly with some moms.

280
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:54,100
But moms in that situation where they need to take care of their newborns.

281
00:29:55,501 --> 00:30:06,766
But I've also recently talked to some people who are in charge of recreational groups in Medford who spend a lot of money on their own to bring in porta-potties.

282
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,461
Um, stuff like that.

283
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:14,966
And so, um, they're interested in seeing what the city can do to help them shift that cost as well.

284
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:18,349
Um, yeah.

285
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:35,184
Uh, I would be curious to hear from, uh, Director Hunt from the planning and permitting, or planning, uh, no, that's the committee, planning department, planning sustainability department, and, um, Director McGivern from

286
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:50,996
DPW or DPW as well, because just of their awareness, their institutional knowledge of the city and this is deceptively a large undertaking.

287
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:56,819
It's the sort of thing that seems like it would be simple and is actually a huge, a huge project.

288
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:05,223
But again, I think Vice President Collins had it hit the nail on the head that it's just because something's hard or

289
00:31:05,987 --> 00:31:08,649
feels overwhelming in the moment doesn't mean you shouldn't start.

290
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,492
So it still needs to be done.

291
00:31:13,233 --> 00:31:18,657
And it's just a fundamental human thing.

292
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:20,759
So we need to try.

293
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,463
So basically we have to talk to every department head in the city.

294
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:34,350
We have to spend a lot of money probably, but I think it will be, I think there are ways to do it that are more

295
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:40,169
efficient and reasonable and if we take our time and do it right then it'll make more sense.

296
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,031
Councilor Lemming.

297
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:42,653
Thank you.

298
00:31:44,406 --> 00:32:11,699
On that, I would motion to request feedback on the cost, potential cost savings and need for these sanitary facilities in public spaces around Medford from Tim McGivern and Alicia Hunt.

299
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:19,133
as well as their recommendation, as well as their long-term recommendations on this problem.

300
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:23,215
Is this like a cost-benefit analysis kind of?

301
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:26,616
Yeah, I was trying to think of a way to word it.

302
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:40,322
But essentially, given the resources, the intent of it is given the resources the city has now, how much do they think that their resources should be prioritized to implementing this?

303
00:32:42,996 --> 00:33:01,886
I'm not sure that Commissioner McGibbon or Department Head Hunt or Director Hunt are in the best positions to provide the answers to that question, just because I don't think there is that much data out there right now about the cost and benefit.

304
00:33:03,288 --> 00:33:15,015
The thing is we could go with a port-a-potty system, but we could also go with other models, which I know some other city staff have been kind of chatting about here and there.

305
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:22,119
I think maybe if you reword the motion just to be talking more about city staff in general, that'd be helpful.

306
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,301
Cause I'm just not sure that they're the ones in the best positions to answer.

307
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:30,483
I know we'll probably want to loop in the rec department as well.

308
00:33:30,583 --> 00:33:31,564
So director Bailey,

309
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:34,010
on that effort too.

310
00:33:36,832 --> 00:33:37,573
Vice President Collins.

311
00:33:37,913 --> 00:33:38,274
Thank you.

312
00:33:38,314 --> 00:33:40,516
Yeah, I support the motion, the amended motion.

313
00:33:40,656 --> 00:33:50,365
And just to further that point, I think that we're at early enough stages here that I'd be curious to hear perspectives from, Councilor Seng mentioned Director Bailey.

314
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:56,211
I also suspect that this is something that Director O'Connor, even if it's slightly more out of her purview, would have some perspective on as this is a health

315
00:33:56,471 --> 00:33:57,872
health issue and engages with.

316
00:33:58,592 --> 00:34:07,596
I'm sure that the prevention and outreach folks have some, you know, they deal with a constituency that would be one beneficiary of these facilities in addition to many, many more.

317
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:13,159
All that to say, gosh, there's so many ways that like a CBA would go with this.

318
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:20,262
I mean, I was thinking like this might be the type of thing that we'd want to get the Chamber of Commerce's feedback on because I know that it is kind of a pressure that Main Street businesses have to deal with it.

319
00:34:20,422 --> 00:34:21,742
We want your patronage.

320
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:25,164
We don't necessarily want to be a restroom facility for people in public, though they need one.

321
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:36,889
So I'd just be really curious to put this pardon me, um, to as many city staff as possible at this early stage because I wouldn't be surprised if we get a lot of support from a lot of different departments.

322
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,409
Thank you.

323
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:45,412
Okay, so, as, as, so, so, Councilor lemmings motion, but.

324
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:49,503
city staff rather than specific.

325
00:34:51,004 --> 00:34:52,805
I'm just unsure how that would be implemented.

326
00:34:52,845 --> 00:34:57,589
Would it be an email to all city staff and then request a general request for feedback?

327
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,611
Vice President Collins?

328
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:02,412
Yeah, I think that we can.

329
00:35:02,952 --> 00:35:16,041
I've certainly made many motions in the past at committee meetings that present a idea proposal or a draft ordinance and send it out to department heads and encourage them at their discretion to get feedback from staff in their department or to just give feedback as department heads.

330
00:35:19,321 --> 00:35:20,863
Yes.

331
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:23,407
Just as a clarification, that would generally go

332
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:44,807
Depending on the exact wording of the motion, what would generally happen is that a copy of the committee report with the relevant motion highlighted would go to the chief of staff with a request that it be distributed to department heads or certain other people, depending on what the motion says.

333
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:52,630
But that's how it would generally go out to other team members in the administration.

334
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:54,756
Thank you.

335
00:35:54,796 --> 00:36:08,865
And I'll just notice for the edification of counselors that haven't done a ordinance process precisely like this before that for me in the past, at least, um, that process is often paired with simply, you know, as as sponsor of the ordinance reaching out to department heads one on one to have conversations about them.

336
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:13,948
Is that acceptable?

337
00:36:13,968 --> 00:36:14,288
Yes.

338
00:36:14,308 --> 00:36:14,668
So the, um

339
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:35,673
new wording of the motion could be, and feel free to feel free to jump in if any of my more experienced colleagues have recommendations to edit it, but a motion to request feedback from department heads on the

340
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:51,685
idea of installing permanent sanitary facilities in public spaces, including our parks, with the invitation to have one-on-one meetings with council members if they feel the need to.

341
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:55,808
Okay.

342
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:56,989
Do we have a second?

343
00:36:57,751 --> 00:36:58,211
I'll second.

344
00:36:58,772 --> 00:37:00,052
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

345
00:37:00,332 --> 00:37:09,777
Before we end discussion though, I just wanted to say, um, um, I wanted to reiterate that this is, as other Councilors have said, this is just the start of a long process.

346
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:19,422
Um, I think right now, um, the question, there's a question of who has what information, what's the best way, um, to get all that information.

347
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:22,063
And one of the roles of the City Council that I see

348
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:29,766
just even broadly, not just with this issue, is that I think one of our jobs is to bring together that information where we can.

349
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:46,034
And I know a lot of this information lies outside of city departments as well, so I'll keep reaching out to non-city staff, members of the community who might be able to help us get some data, get some idea of where our priority parks are, how much they're already spending on stuff like this.

350
00:37:47,394 --> 00:37:49,335
So I can keep working on that.

351
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:50,916
I think my vision for this is

352
00:37:51,966 --> 00:38:11,558
even if this is not the most feasible project in the short term, if we can collect that data and if we can put together a roadmap to get to a place where we can implement it, maybe even get to the point where we can craft together a proposal to present to the mayor during budget season, I think that's my goal at least with this item.

353
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:15,921
Vice President Collins.

354
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:16,973
Thank you.

355
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:19,895
Yeah, I appreciate the words from Councillor Seng.

356
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:35,246
And I also just want to note, again, we're talking about something, a project that we're at the very, very preliminary stages of, especially with the restroom facilities and public spaces, which is, you know, more logistical than just us crafting an ordinance and working with city staff to implement it.

357
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:40,030
But also, this is part of a story tradition of

358
00:38:41,091 --> 00:38:53,650
elected and city staff working together to bring online what are essentially logistical or capital expenses, which is a, you know, usually a multi year process, and we've approved some cap.

359
00:38:55,498 --> 00:39:12,700
capital expenditures from our stabilization funds recently that are kind of, you know, kind of tell the end of that story where these capital expenses have been requested and advocated for and discussed and budgeted for and plan for for years and then eventually we get the, you know that the planning and the funds come together and we're able to

360
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,032
them together and make an expenditure and bring something online.

361
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:19,854
And in both cases, it's something that we know that we need.

362
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:26,720
It's something that pertains directly to the existing needs of residents, and it takes a few years sometimes to bring it into implementation.

363
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:29,563
But I just see that as part of that same process.

364
00:39:29,603 --> 00:39:35,709
So again, I appreciate Councilor Sang for bringing this forward, and I think that our discussions about this topic

365
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:36,569
to make sure that.

366
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:37,210
Um are well worth.

367
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,191
It will be well worth it to residents and visitors to the city.

368
00:39:40,891 --> 00:39:49,416
Um and the same for the ordinances that we're working on in concert to make sure that, um, people in Medford have fallen unfettered access to the rights that they already have.

369
00:39:49,856 --> 00:39:50,156
Thank you.

370
00:39:51,837 --> 00:39:52,137
Thank you.

371
00:39:53,518 --> 00:39:53,718
I do

372
00:40:07,206 --> 00:40:07,727
Thank you.

373
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:08,447
Mr Wilworth.

374
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:12,910
I get Chuck Wilworth 32 Bow Street.

375
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:28,281
I had spoken with counselors saying before, um, the president of the board of Medford Youth Girls Softball, and it is a big part of our budget is well over 10% of our budget to put fortified these in the various fields we play at.

376
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,163
So, um, we would

377
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:40,750
Thank you for coming and speaking on behalf of that.

378
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:43,812
We appreciate you taking the time.

379
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:53,618
I do, another thing to note is that I've observed that some parks have port-a-potties at them.

380
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,822
I'm not sure who pays for them, why they're there at some times of the year and other times they're not.

381
00:40:58,902 --> 00:41:04,466
It must be some privately funded, maybe it's an organization like Medford Youth Soccer, maybe it's the softball.

382
00:41:04,526 --> 00:41:06,367
Yeah, it's probably different times of year.

383
00:41:07,227 --> 00:41:16,649
privately funded, but it's inequitable because it's at different places, and then you have access to it sometimes, and then sometimes you don't.

384
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:19,990
So just something to keep in mind.

385
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:36,894
Many parts of the city are privatized right now, and if there's an opportunity for us to explore ways that we can give access to folks in the city publicly, then maybe we should explore that.

386
00:41:38,127 --> 00:41:40,569
Yeah, I'm totally in agreement about the equity point.

387
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,454
I mean, especially with so many groups in our city using stuff like this.

388
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:50,679
There are groups out there who also just can't afford to have a resource like this.

389
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:55,003
I think, even once I passed that just bigger picture.

390
00:41:56,244 --> 00:41:58,926
Thank you Chuck for hopping on this call.

391
00:42:00,307 --> 00:42:09,775
I think government in general has a responsibility to figure out how we can lower the costs that private residents are spending on things as well.

392
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:11,517
And so, you know,

393
00:42:12,637 --> 00:42:26,023
If one recreational group is spending that much and another recreational group is also spending a lot of money on this, I think it does make sense for government to step in and say, we're gonna provide this resource and it's gonna cost all of us as a society less.

394
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:31,566
Right, pennies on the dollar compared to what it would cost one organization.

395
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:38,549
On the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

396
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:40,307
All opposed?

397
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:41,848
The motion passes.

398
00:42:41,868 --> 00:42:49,293
Do we have any other motions for this paper before... Any other motions on the floor?

399
00:42:50,494 --> 00:42:52,095
Yes, Councilor, Vice President Collins.

400
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:57,178
I would just motion to keep all papers in committee and adjourn pending further comment.

401
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:58,980
Second.

402
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:03,383
On the motion, Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

403
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:04,183
All those in favor?

404
00:43:04,203 --> 00:43:04,643
Aye.

405
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:05,544
All opposed?

406
00:43:05,964 --> 00:43:07,605
Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.

407
00:43:07,645 --> 00:43:08,166
Thank you, everybody.
