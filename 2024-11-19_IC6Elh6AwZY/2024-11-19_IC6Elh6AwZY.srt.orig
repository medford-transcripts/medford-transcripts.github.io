31
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:20,990
[SPEAKER_02]: First, personally, it's the first time I've been back here for a while.

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:31,040
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to publicly again thank my colleagues and the Meffitt community in supporting my family and my mother's battle and then

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:42,684
[SPEAKER_02]: just recently her death and I appreciate everybody for standing beside me and this brings me to this resolution.

34
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:46,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, I really didn't want to miss another meeting.

35
00:01:47,505 --> 00:01:48,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I jumped on Zoom.

36
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:54,448
[SPEAKER_02]: I was still with family and I was trying to do the city's work and as I

37
00:01:55,587 --> 00:02:00,631
[SPEAKER_02]: went back and checked my notes, I realized that I listened to the question in reverse.

38
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:01,992
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made a mistake.

39
00:02:03,153 --> 00:02:07,897
[SPEAKER_02]: I contacted Clark Curtabese the next morning and asked for reconsideration.

40
00:02:07,957 --> 00:02:17,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know it was a lot of work, but my preference would be leaving it alone or looking at another section.

41
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:21,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now I'd like to reconsider and change my vote.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,168
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Pele for reconsideration, seconded by?

43
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Mox.

44
00:02:30,213 --> 00:02:31,034

[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

46
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:34,480
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

47
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

48
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:43,617
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Gail, would you like to do another small presentation for Councilor Scott Pelham?

49
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:45,359
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I think it's unnecessary.

50
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,700
[SPEAKER_13]: We know what the options are in front of us.

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,882
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it, but I knew what Ms.

52
00:02:49,902 --> 00:02:52,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Gail said, and unfortunately, I just listened to the question.

53
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:59,530
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't the presentation that was questioned.

54
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to adopt this plan that makes no changes, Mr. President.

55
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:09,819
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to read paper 2551 again.

56
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:13,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, do you have that?

57
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me get the paper.

58
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:20,367
21551. 21551.

59
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:43,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Two, President Richard Caravaglia and members of the Memphis City Council, plans for redistricting.

60
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:56,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Because there was a motion for reconsideration, the three preceding maps presented during the last two Committee of the Whole meetings on September 20th, 2021 and October 5th, 2021, and at the October 12th, 2021 City Council meeting are provided on this meeting agenda.

61
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:10,487
[SPEAKER_15]: The full plans for re-precincting are available for view on the city clerk's office.

62
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:13,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Morrell.

63
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:14,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

64
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:15,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just wanted to clarify.

65
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:22,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Plan A, although it's no change to the number of wards and precincts, there is slight changes to the boundaries of it.

66
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:23,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

67
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:29,482
[SPEAKER_15]: So to make it clear, the council voted last week to adopt Plan A, correct?

68
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:29,922
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

69
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:33,465
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, sorry, Plan C. C. Plan C. Okay.

70
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:35,778
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Mr. President.

71
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,279
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Marks.

72
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:53,564
[SPEAKER_19]: So just if I could, Mr. President, a majority of this council last week voted for plan C, which was the most disruptive change to our polling places, added eight new precincts.

73
00:04:55,625 --> 00:05:02,967
[SPEAKER_19]: Plan A is the least disruptive and plan B was what I would consider a middle of the road adding

74
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:08,578
[SPEAKER_19]: award nine to the Wellington area with some slight disruption.

75
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:12,082
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want the record to reflect that, Mr President.

76
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:19,250
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're going from the most disruptive, which a majority of this council voted for now to no change at all, more or less.

77
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,253
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want the record to reflect that.

78
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:23,094
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr President.

79
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,015
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have a motion on the floor?

80
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:34,512
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by vice president say a second and by second.

81
00:05:34,973 --> 00:05:36,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Councilor Baez.

82
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:37,696
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

83
00:05:44,826 --> 00:05:46,388

[SPEAKER_03]: motion to adopt.

85
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:02,523

89
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:10,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

90
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:11,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight?

91
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:12,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

92
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:13,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks?

93
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:13,627
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

94
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:15,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morrell?

95
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:16,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

96
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:18,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli?

97
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:18,368
No.

98
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:20,709
[SPEAKER_03]: President Caraballo?

99
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:22,830
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

100
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,772
[SPEAKER_15]: For the affirmative, three in the negative, motion passes for plan A.

101
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:30,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

102
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:50,106
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're on the suspension, 21-596, petition for a common victor license by Fagan Lee, 21 Ellington Road, Quincy, for Barry Lee, LLC, doing business as Asian Taste, 207 Middlesex Avenue, Medford.

103
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:56,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Licensing Chairman, Councilor Scott Pele is ahead.

104
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:00,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have anyone from the restaurant this evening on the call?

105
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:01,792
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, sir.

106
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:07,115
[SPEAKER_18]: If you can hear me, this is Attorney Wage on behalf of DLC with this pending application.

107
00:07:08,196 --> 00:07:09,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, excuse me.

108
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:10,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please, sir.

109
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:15,260
[SPEAKER_18]: First name, W-E-I, last name, J-I-A.

110
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, Councilor Scott Pele.

111
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:22,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

112
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:28,488
[SPEAKER_02]: As I reviewed all the paperwork, I know that everything seems in order.

113
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:36,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this is a Asian taste restaurant on Middlesex Ave.

114
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:41,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this just a family run restaurant?

115
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

116
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:48,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we changing anything that we have right now in the footprint?

117
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:51,514
[SPEAKER_18]: No, there'll be no changes at all.

118
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:58,777
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to remain the same operating hour remains, and the liquor license transfer has been heard by licensing board.

119
00:07:58,837 --> 00:08:00,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it's now before ABCC.

120
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:01,939
[SPEAKER_18]: Other than that, there's no change.

121
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,560
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I see everything in order, Mr. President.

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So I request any additional comments from my colleagues.

123
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:11,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

124
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:12,544
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Knight.

125
00:08:13,004 --> 00:08:14,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

126
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:15,425
[SPEAKER_13]: If you recall,

127
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:31,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Some years ago, probably, maybe two and a half years ago, this council had passed a resolution requesting that the operators, not only Asian Taste, but the operators in that stretch of buildings, refrain from parking on the sidewalk.

128
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:39,697
[SPEAKER_13]: What was happening is people were using the handicap ramp as a driveway and driving up on the sidewalk because the sidewalk has a lot of width and a lot of space.

129
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:44,261
[SPEAKER_13]: The council had requested that bolus be put in and the bolus were put in.

130
00:08:44,961 --> 00:08:51,503
[SPEAKER_13]: However, they will put him wide enough where vehicles could still drive up the handicap accessible ramp onto the sidewalk.

131
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:55,944
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to reiterate to the gentleman, I certainly have no problem with the license transfer.

132
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:58,145
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an enforcement issue that should be handled through enforcement.

133
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:03,206
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really a function of the city administration, not this council, to ensure the vehicles don't park on the sidewalk.

134
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:10,128
[SPEAKER_13]: But with that being said, with the license being transferred, I want to reiterate this council's position that that type of behavior is not

135
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:18,132
[SPEAKER_13]: something that we'd like to see there at that location, and we've taken steps and voted affirmatively on a number of occasions to install safety measures to prevent it from happening.

136
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:33,941
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm hoping that, you know, as we move forward, Mr. President, that the representative for the business entity can convey the Council's concern relative to the parking circumstances and situations at that location and make sure that they refrain from parking on the sidewalk in that spot.

137
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:36,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

138
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:40,205
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Mr. Lee, were you able to hear Vice President Knight's concerns?

139
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:43,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, the comments is noted.

140
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:54,003
[SPEAKER_18]: We will let my client to make sure that the parking situations could be maintained according to the requirements.

141
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:55,904
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

142
00:09:56,164 --> 00:09:57,245
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate it.

143
00:09:58,205 --> 00:10:03,307
[SPEAKER_18]: As a matter of fact, while we are working with the landlord, the landlord also raised this issue.

144
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:06,249
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are fully aware of this situation.

145
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:08,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

146
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:11,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further questions?

147
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:16,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion for approval by Councilor Scott Felly.

148
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:17,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by?

149
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:19,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

150
00:10:19,383 --> 00:10:20,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Seconded by Vice President Knight.

151
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:21,944
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

152
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:22,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

153
00:10:22,825 --> 00:10:23,525
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

154
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:25,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

155
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Chair, and enjoy the rest of your day.

156
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, gentlemen.

157
00:10:28,888 --> 00:10:29,328
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

158
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:31,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good evening.

159
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,351
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, motion to revert back to regular business.

160
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:40,334
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

161
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:41,756
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

162
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:43,077
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

163
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:44,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

164
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:48,863
[SPEAKER_15]: 5-9-2 offered by Councilor Behrs.

165
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:56,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the Mayor and City Administration... Mr. President, I think we skipped Councilor Nights.

166
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,812
[SPEAKER_15]: 5-9... Oh, you withdrew?

167
00:10:57,832 --> 00:10:58,112
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

168
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:13,790
[SPEAKER_15]: being resolved by the Memphis City Council that the mayor and the city administration hire a crossing guard on Fells Way West for the Robert school students and families who face a significant danger from high-speed car traffic on a daily basis.

169
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Betz.

170
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:15,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

171
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:18,054
[SPEAKER_14]: The resolution is pretty self-explanatory.

172
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:25,258
[SPEAKER_14]: The vast majority of the student age population of the Roberts School lives north of Felsway West.

173
00:11:25,438 --> 00:11:30,640
[SPEAKER_14]: The Roberts School is south of Felsway West, and you have a lot of students and families crossing that street every day.

174
00:11:31,281 --> 00:11:40,465
[SPEAKER_14]: As a resident of Felsway West, I can tell you that people speed down our street very regularly, going as fast as 35, 40 miles an hour.

175
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:43,767
[SPEAKER_14]: There have been a lot of near misses, a lot of close calls.

176
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:48,587
[SPEAKER_14]: with elementary school students who are

177
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:52,785
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, facing risk every day, just trying to go to school.

178
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:58,187
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have Safe Routes to School and other projects that are underway to make that stretch safer.

179
00:11:59,108 --> 00:12:16,776
[SPEAKER_14]: But in this specific case, I think it would be really good to have a crossing guard over at, on Fellsboy West, at one of the, maybe one of the new crosswalks, just to allow for safe passage for all of these students to the Roberts School.

180
00:12:21,345 --> 00:12:23,467
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would move approval pending discussion.

181
00:12:23,607 --> 00:12:23,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

182
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:28,112
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Baez, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

183
00:12:28,912 --> 00:12:30,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falcone.

184
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:32,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

185
00:12:32,536 --> 00:12:34,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Biez for bringing this forward.

186
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:39,761
[SPEAKER_05]: This has been an issue for many years, and I know we've tried to address this in the past.

187
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:45,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Crossing at that intersection is dangerous to begin with any time of day.

188
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:50,568
[SPEAKER_05]: People are racing to get to the highway, and this is something that definitely needs to be addressed.

189
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:55,672
[SPEAKER_05]: So I am definitely in favor and in support of this resolution, and I move approval.

190
00:12:55,812 --> 00:12:56,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

191
00:13:00,107 --> 00:13:03,129
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Behr, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

192
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:03,890
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

193
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:04,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

194
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:04,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

195
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:07,492
[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it.

196
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:13,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Council paper 21593, offered by President Caraviello.

197
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:29,347
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved, the Memphis City Council have the DPW and administration replace the sidewalks from Brook Street, on the Brook Street from Harvard Street to Irving, replace the sidewalks on Brook Street from High Street to Irving Street.

198
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,542
[SPEAKER_13]: We're looking at comes to go.

199
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:33,604
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you in the interest of public safety.

200
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:35,527
[SPEAKER_13]: My apologies for butchering that to death.

201
00:13:35,807 --> 00:13:37,429
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair recognizes Councilor Cabello.

202
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

203
00:13:40,032 --> 00:13:48,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Last week, I was followed by a few residents up that lower end of Butch Street to go up there and look at the sidewalks there.

204
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:57,111
[SPEAKER_15]: When I got there, half the street has a sidewalk, the other half is going up toward the Irving Street side.

205
00:13:57,892 --> 00:13:58,673
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no curbing.

206
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:00,895
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just plain tar.

207
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,458
[SPEAKER_15]: There's certain parts on the other side of the street.

208
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:21,043
[SPEAKER_15]: that have they have holes holes in the sidewalk and there's been no curbing nothing that in this disabled residents but also lives on that side of the street so I would ask that the administration replace those sidewalks in curbing in the interest of public safety and I think we have some people here.

209
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:23,063
[SPEAKER_13]: They want to speak on that this evening.

210
00:14:23,344 --> 00:14:33,606
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely and if I may miss the copy of the law in the morning it is a very difficult street to drive down because that's the way I take my kids to school and that's very difficult to be able to pass the same time going up and down the street.

211
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:39,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Before we just recognize, is there any counselors have any comments that they'd like to add?

212
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,562
[SPEAKER_13]: We open it up to the general public.

213
00:14:42,762 --> 00:14:45,267
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

214
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:54,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all want to say a little bit of something, but we've all talked together.

215
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:59,215
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll go first and then I'll sort of pass it along to name an address for the record.

216
00:14:59,235 --> 00:14:59,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

217
00:14:59,335 --> 00:14:59,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

218
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:04,520
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Catherine Cohen and I live at 15 Brooke street in Medford.

219
00:15:05,641 --> 00:15:07,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the mom of twin three-year-olds.

220
00:15:08,938 --> 00:15:14,162
[SPEAKER_06]: For my family, sidewalks, traffic speeds, and safety are all directly connected.

221
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:31,857
[SPEAKER_06]: My house is positioned very close to the street, and without curbs to serve as a safety buffer, people park right on the so-called sidewalk, as you saw, basically at the front of our stairs, making it impossible to maneuver a twin stroller.

222
00:15:32,517 --> 00:15:36,681
[SPEAKER_06]: As a result, most days I end up taking my twins in the stroller out into the street,

223
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:40,896
[SPEAKER_06]: Additionally, there are sinkholes in crumbling asphalt.

224
00:15:42,877 --> 00:15:51,205
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll hear a little bit from Rosemary who has fallen in those sinkholes and I believe made a complaint with the city but received no response.

225
00:15:51,745 --> 00:15:58,951
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also a neighbor who recently, you'll hear from, stepped in a pothole or even a sinkhole and really severely injured herself.

226
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,775
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do want to also talk to the speed, which you talked about.

227
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:13,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Cars gather momentum at the very, very top of the hill, and so by the time they're at the bottom of Brooks, they are going so quickly and seem to hit the accelerator once they hit our lower Brooks.

228
00:16:14,267 --> 00:16:22,776
[SPEAKER_06]: We're right in the Brooks Elementary school zone, and there are so many kids that come through our streets every single day with families and child residents.

229
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:33,002
[SPEAKER_06]: multiple accidents, car accidents have already occurred due to the speeding and the blind spots created by the dense parking, because people park on both sides of the street.

230
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:40,326
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such a narrow street, and there's people parked on both sides of the street, and then it's also two ways, so it just makes basically no sense.

231
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:54,739
[SPEAKER_06]: So because there are no curbs or true sidewalks on the majority of the street, cars take over, they park on what should be the sidewalk, artificially widening the street, and then traffic thinks they can go even faster, because it's been widened.

232
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:58,221
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really creates a hazardous, vicious cycle.

233
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:00,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have some potential solutions.

234
00:17:00,982 --> 00:17:02,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll pass it to my neighbors.

235
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Name and address for the record, please, sir.

236
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:08,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

237
00:17:09,006 --> 00:17:10,187
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Timothy Conant.

238
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:11,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 20 Brooks Street.

239
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,122
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some potential solutions that we discussed as a block.

240
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:24,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the residents of our street have met to discuss possible solutions.

241
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:35,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Among them, we have discussed speed bumps, installing real curbs on the entire block, which can be coupled with a custom size narrower sidewalks that will not impact parking.

242
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:43,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider one-way traffic on Brooks between Irving and High, like many other blocks in the neighborhood, which feed onto busy arterial streets.

243
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:54,178
[SPEAKER_00]: And possibly do not enter except for a resident sign on the corner of Irving and High to prevent traffic flow, heavy traffic flow.

244
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not enter during certain times of the day, busy traffic times, rush hour.

245
00:17:59,943 --> 00:18:03,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Many examples in the neighborhood are streets that are like that.

246
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:12,090
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be helpful if curb sidewalks were installed because the street becomes narrow, forces traffic to naturally slow, thereby breaking the cycle.

247
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:14,991
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be helpful to do.

248
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:19,673
[SPEAKER_00]: And a 24-7 permit parking to prevent non-residential parking.

249
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,594
[SPEAKER_00]: And a stop sign at the corner of Brooks and High Street.

250
00:18:23,614 --> 00:18:24,635
[SPEAKER_00]: There's never been one there.

251
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:33,378
[SPEAKER_00]: They zip down the street and people don't stop at the crosswalk, endangering kids going to Brooks School, pedestrians just walking back and forth from

252
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:35,804
[SPEAKER_00]: across across high street.

253
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:37,425
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

254
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:39,828
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I'm a I'm a dad.

255
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:40,708
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grandfather.

256
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:42,070
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grandchildren visiting us.

257
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,893
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dangerous street when we get out of the car because we park on the street.

258
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:46,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

259
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:50,718
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address the record, please, ma'am.

260
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:56,442
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Catherine Arita, and I live at 7 Alston Court, and I also park on Brook Street.

261
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:59,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Alston Court is just a little bit behind Brook Street.

262
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:03,224
[SPEAKER_12]: And like Tim, my husband and I park on the street.

263
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:06,544
[SPEAKER_12]: We have two little kids, ages six and ages one.

264
00:19:07,264 --> 00:19:12,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Getting my one-year-old out of his car seat is scary because people come tearing down the street.

265
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:18,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Not having sidewalk space is difficult for our strollers, difficult for us when we're taking a walk.

266
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:33,997
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I think the lack of curves on the sidewalk actually make parking more of a challenge for people because the street is such a mess that people try to avoid all the divots and the sinkholes kind of creating less parking instead of more parking.

267
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:38,340
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm here in solidarity with my neighbors and hope something can be done.

268
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:39,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

269
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:48,706
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, my name is Rae Rae Geldart and I live at 19 Brook Street.

270
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I live right in front of the worst sick hole ever.

271
00:19:51,928 --> 00:19:58,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I also do dog training and I work, manage a Starbucks right next to Mystic Valley Parkway.

272
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:08,017
[SPEAKER_09]: There are so many other issues, but if we could solve this one, when I first moved into this house two years ago, I was like, just shocked that it is on a hill.

273
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:12,655
[SPEAKER_09]: and that the water flow would naturally create more and more problems.

274
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:17,979
[SPEAKER_09]: But also the fact that I walk dogs, I've been able to actually see the fact that you guys are all fixing other streets.

275
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,500
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the street, it's one, it's next to a school.

276
00:20:20,981 --> 00:20:22,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Two, it's on one of the biggest hills.

277
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:25,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Three, there's families right here and there.

278
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:27,445
[SPEAKER_09]: And guess what happened to me last week?

279
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:31,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually just fell right into one of those divots and my body is my bread and butter.

280
00:20:32,248 --> 00:20:35,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I could not even believe the amount of scare I had.

281
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:44,613
[SPEAKER_09]: that if there was a curb that goes, this is the end of the sidewalk, you step, I would, I had to go, I had to take time out of work.

282
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:46,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I also had to pay for the doctor's bill.

283
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:55,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Nevermind the absolute scare that everything I was going to have to do was wrapped up in the fact that this would have been a really easy fix if you guys did this.

284
00:20:56,636 --> 00:21:02,858
[SPEAKER_09]: But to furthermore, the amount of fixing you guys are doing already

285
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:15,733
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to be of a travesty or a loss or an oversight that is not part of the process of what you're fixing among all the other streets I already see you working on.

286
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:22,156
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really see all the streets because I walk many hours all over Medford.

287
00:21:23,216 --> 00:21:24,977
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe in your power to do right.

288
00:21:25,678 --> 00:21:30,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And this should really be something that is a focus being that it's already next to a school.

289
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,321
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already next to a hill.

290
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:43,171
[SPEAKER_09]: We've already seen the amount of water that is coming from the onset of the weather that is only going to further erode these roads.

291
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:48,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't imagine how much the salt is gonna make these potholes bigger.

292
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:52,136
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am myself, I'm like, person who never falls.

293
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:55,018
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that I fell, I was like, that's it.

294
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I just gotta say, it's a really simple fix.

295
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,082
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised we need a council meeting to do this.

296
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:07,408
[SPEAKER_09]: because you're already fixing other roads, I would have thought this would have already been on the agenda.

297
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please, ma'am.

298
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosemary TN 19 Brooke Street.

299
00:22:24,811 --> 00:22:29,732
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess what I'd like to say is that, you know, the street is now

300
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,512
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the cars parked along the sidewalk.

301
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:39,195
[SPEAKER_11]: So then you'd have to go out into this narrow street around the cars.

302
00:22:39,475 --> 00:22:48,340
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've often had to walk all the way down to High Street in the street because the cars were on the sidewalk.

303
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,843
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't get through without walking into the street.

304
00:22:53,604 --> 00:22:55,705
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's a very bad idea.

305
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:59,187
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope that we can do something about

306
00:23:00,061 --> 00:23:02,662
[SPEAKER_11]: making it illegal to park on the sidewalks.

307
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:13,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I need to just furthermore, these massive gaps that are like, I don't even know, eight to 12 inches deep are directly in front of her house.

308
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:14,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what we're looking for.

309
00:23:15,888 --> 00:23:17,548
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a co-incident?

310
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:18,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

311
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,190
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is John Beaubret.

312
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,051
[SPEAKER_20]: I live at 24 Brook Street.

313
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:34,879
[SPEAKER_20]: I came down to the council meeting prior to the pandemic and asked to have the sidewalks looked at.

314
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,122
[SPEAKER_20]: And you told me that they would be looked at and they would be taken care of, and they have not been taken care of.

315
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:47,705
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as I know, DPW has never come up and looked at them, and they haven't been repaired.

316
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,860
[SPEAKER_20]: I can give you a lot of history about the street.

317
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,361
[SPEAKER_20]: I've lived there all my life.

318
00:23:54,382 --> 00:24:00,126
[SPEAKER_20]: And the reason why cars park on the sidewalk is because there are no curbs.

319
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:11,854
[SPEAKER_20]: And 25 years ago, 30 years ago, my mother got a ticket for parking on the sidewalk and you cannot tell the sidewalk from the street up there.

320
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:12,935
[SPEAKER_20]: So,

321
00:24:14,139 --> 00:24:25,009
[SPEAKER_20]: They, she came down here to the council meeting, they decided that parking a little bit on the sidewalk was okay, but they don't park a little bit on the sidewalk anymore.

322
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:29,332
[SPEAKER_20]: In front of 5 Brooke Street, they take up the whole sidewalk to park down there.

323
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:33,076
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just been very, it's very dangerous.

324
00:24:34,878 --> 00:24:37,760
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I hope something can be done about this.

325
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it what you see in residents in the neighborhood that live in these houses, or is this?

326
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:42,824
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes.

327
00:24:42,844 --> 00:24:44,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it also commuters, or?

328
00:24:44,546 --> 00:24:51,271
[SPEAKER_20]: In front of 5 Brooke Street, there are people that live in those houses down there, and they block the whole sidewalk.

329
00:24:51,832 --> 00:24:53,073
[SPEAKER_20]: And poor Rosemary can't walk.

330
00:24:53,273 --> 00:24:54,674
[SPEAKER_20]: That's on her side of the street.

331
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,395
[SPEAKER_20]: She can't walk down the street.

332
00:24:56,415 --> 00:25:00,799
[SPEAKER_20]: She has to actually cross Brooke Street in order to get on the sidewalk.

333
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,821
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a piece of sidewalk that's concrete.

334
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:06,524
[SPEAKER_20]: And that part of the sidewalk is fine.

335
00:25:07,285 --> 00:25:12,374
[SPEAKER_20]: And she actually has to cross the street to get on that concrete part of the sidewalk to get down the street.

336
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:14,798
[SPEAKER_20]: And it just shouldn't be that way.

337
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:16,480
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. President.

338
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,300
[SPEAKER_19]: The chair recognizes Councilman.

339
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:29,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President, and first I'd like to state that parking on a sidewalk is illegal in the community, it needs to be enforced.

340
00:25:29,884 --> 00:25:33,065
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's the first thing, parking on a sidewalk is illegal.

341
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:39,447
[SPEAKER_19]: Secondly, Mr. President, I believe I was the one that offered the motion back before the pandemic.

342
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:48,409
[SPEAKER_19]: to have the administration go out and take a look at the sidewalks and curbing and the condition of that street.

343
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Not to pass the buck, but all we can do is make recommendations.

344
00:25:54,751 --> 00:26:02,133
[SPEAKER_19]: So even if we vote tonight to have your street repaved, every sidewalk fixed, all the curbing, it does not mean it's gonna take place.

345
00:26:02,593 --> 00:26:04,394
[SPEAKER_19]: It has to be the city administration.

346
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:07,456
[SPEAKER_19]: So just so you know, that's what we're up against.

347
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:17,466
[SPEAKER_19]: So we can offer all the resolutions we want, but ultimately the day-to-day operations of the city and where the streets get done is up to the city administration.

348
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:24,012
[SPEAKER_19]: So the fact that you said that you see all these streets getting done and so forth, that is not this council.

349
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:26,874
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the administration.

350
00:26:26,894 --> 00:26:27,215
[SPEAKER_19]: Excuse me?

351
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:41,507
[SPEAKER_19]: The city administration know the council is the only open forum but you know I would highly recommend that residents reach out to the city administration and let them know the concern.

352
00:26:41,787 --> 00:26:49,474
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure we'll all reiterate it tonight here, but I just want people to be aware that the buy in has to be from the city administration.

353
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:56,976
[SPEAKER_19]: It was this council that offered the ordinance was actually my ordinance that reduce the speed in the city from 30 to 25.

354
00:26:58,697 --> 00:27:01,839
[SPEAKER_19]: And that was done through city ordinance, which we have control over.

355
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,860
[SPEAKER_19]: So the council did take action.

356
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:07,155
[SPEAKER_19]: when we heard about the speeding throughout the community.

357
00:27:07,836 --> 00:27:11,719
[SPEAKER_19]: This council did take action on a number of issues, i.e.

358
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:16,023
[SPEAKER_19]: being not speed bumps, but raised crosswalks.

359
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:17,364
[SPEAKER_19]: They're more effective.

360
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:27,552
[SPEAKER_19]: And we started a pilot program back some years ago, and we did one on Winthrop Street, close to Boston Ave, and there was supposed to be a number of other raised crosswalks.

361
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:30,434
[SPEAKER_19]: This would be an ideal place for-

362
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,696
[SPEAKER_19]: for a raised crosswalk.

363
00:27:33,076 --> 00:27:36,558
[SPEAKER_19]: However, the city has failed to act on that.

364
00:27:37,158 --> 00:27:43,321
[SPEAKER_19]: So it wasn't this council, the council made recommendations, the city has failed to offer these traffic calming approaches.

365
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:58,569
[SPEAKER_19]: So this council, in my opinion, has been very proactive, talking about curbing, widening sidewalks to reduce speed, lowering the speed limit, which we did, and tried to get ahead of the cut through traffic and the speeding that's going on.

366
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:06,579
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we all agree that something in the area needs to take place and I'm sure my other council colleagues will make comment as well.

367
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:11,441
[SPEAKER_19]: But I just want the residents to know that if it was up to this council, it'd be done next week.

368
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:14,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, it's not up to this council.

369
00:28:16,348 --> 00:28:23,653
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to recognize a few of the councils that have some commentary that they'd like to say, and I'm more than happy to give you another opportunity to speak.

370
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:25,654
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair recognizes Councilor Scott Peller.

371
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:26,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

372
00:28:26,615 --> 00:28:28,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, Councilor Moxley, for bringing that up.

373
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:31,578
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think these are the issues and concerns we have because

374
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:35,718
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, today it's our friends from Brooks Street.

375
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:39,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And last month is our friends from Fulton Heights.

376
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:43,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one, we'll get one from South Method.

377
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're hearing you.

378
00:28:44,940 --> 00:29:01,064
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm gonna suggest today, something that we see that works, I think was Council Falco that brought this up in the Fulton Heights area, is that we call for a meeting with all the parties involved, city administration, traffic engineer, traffic department, police chief,

379
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:04,125
[SPEAKER_02]: and really have a meeting at the site.

380
00:29:04,766 --> 00:29:08,229
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we did that and was it Fulton Fulton Spring Road.

381
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:17,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the things we talked about some of the traffic common measures, measures, weren't as extensive or expensive or time consuming like we're talking about because

382
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:29,316
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound like it's, it's obviously what it is very unsafe, and especially for neighbors that that can't traverse their own front of the house I think it's it's a disgrace.

383
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:36,480
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think that with this council's support that we call for a meeting relatively soon and whether it's getting bad but

384
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,301
[SPEAKER_02]: We do it at the location.

385
00:29:38,762 --> 00:29:40,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talk about some of the traffic calming measures.

386
00:29:41,484 --> 00:29:44,426
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, stop signs, making sure lines are painted.

387
00:29:45,787 --> 00:29:52,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the raised sidewalks, but if it's a long direct street that in other parts of the neighborhood, we see them in Lawrence Road.

388
00:29:52,953 --> 00:29:57,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, not a speed bump, but do you recall the name?

389
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:59,058
[SPEAKER_02]: The speed table?

390
00:29:59,178 --> 00:30:04,122
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where it's raised, where there are lines painted on it, where people can see it as it's coming up.

391
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:05,143
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not drastic.

392
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:08,384
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, bump, but it's, it's, it's risen.

393
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:09,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to slow down.

394
00:30:10,164 --> 00:30:16,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we could talk about, you know, one way the do not enter what the process is for doing a one way.

395
00:30:17,046 --> 00:30:31,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we can do because this council could present it all and what we'll do tonight, I'm sure we'll all send this out to the city administration and then we'll get a little piece of paper next Tuesday and it'll say, you know, from the mayor's office who they sent it to and

396
00:30:33,661 --> 00:30:37,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, once we get to that point, we're left with.

397
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:45,777
[SPEAKER_02]: a year later, a constituent coming back and saying, thank you for putting on, but we haven't seen anything yet.

398
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,960
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that needs to be followed up with a better format.

399
00:30:49,980 --> 00:31:03,910
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'm trying to say is, I'll make the motion tonight that we call for a meeting at the location with all of the parties that need to be there, whether it's city administration, chief of police, traffic engineer,

400
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:05,846
[SPEAKER_02]: DPW.

401
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:22,390
[SPEAKER_02]: DPW, of course, so we can get things, you know, we'll reach out to DPW direct tomorrow and we'll ask them to at least go to where the areas are where there are giant potholes where we have neighbors falling in 12 inches that they can patch those right away.

402
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:27,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see why that's something that we can reach out quickly for, but- What did I mention?

403
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:28,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.

404
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:32,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli, with all due respect, they're not patchable.

405
00:31:35,294 --> 00:31:40,858
[SPEAKER_15]: These are just eroded sidewalks that were hot topped at some point.

406
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:47,383
[SPEAKER_15]: And the hot top is just, because they're on the lower end of the hill, the water keeps coming down, washing it away, washing it away.

407
00:31:47,884 --> 00:32:01,034
[SPEAKER_15]: And the major part of the problem is, if they had a sidewalk that's supposed to be there with the curb, the street wouldn't be as wide and it would slow the cars down on its own.

408
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:02,175
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, which is-

409
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,890
[SPEAKER_15]: which is its own traffic calming measure.

410
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:26,059
[SPEAKER_02]: So the resolution, Mr. President, the resolution is to have the meeting and get all the parties involved so we can do an on-site visit so you're not running around talking to this body that unfortunately, I wish I made the call that said, let's go do that because there were 30 last year that we asked to fix too.

411
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,120
[SPEAKER_02]: listen, it's not good.

412
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,660
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that.

413
00:32:29,101 --> 00:32:33,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe me, I apologize, but this is getting frustrating for us too.

414
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:41,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I asked my colleagues to join me in voting to have an onsite with all the, all the department heads that need to be there.

415
00:32:42,189 --> 00:32:43,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

416
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:43,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

417
00:32:44,191 --> 00:32:50,175
[SPEAKER_15]: If we could have the disability in front of this, this woman's house is a pretty decent size hall.

418
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:50,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

419
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:56,889
[SPEAKER_15]: And I say, I was down there.

420
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:04,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Vice President, and I want to thank you all for coming out here.

421
00:33:04,845 --> 00:33:07,726
[SPEAKER_08]: When my dog wants to walk that far, I walk down there, I'm forcing the road.

422
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:08,286
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same thing.

423
00:33:08,346 --> 00:33:10,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm very familiar with the issues that go on there.

424
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:19,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And you would think that because it's so close to the school, because kids are walking, they're biking, people are taking their kids down the street, that it would have priority.

425
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we haven't seen that yet.

426
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:29,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Councilor Scarpelli's resolution is a great idea because what these meetings have allowed us to do, you guys presented so many great ideas.

427
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:43,105
[SPEAKER_08]: You can be there in real time with the traffic engineer and they can say here's what's feasible here's what's not from a ADA point standpoint from an engineering standpoint from a funding standpoint, and we were able to leave with some concrete solutions.

428
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:49,711
[SPEAKER_08]: The last time we did this so I know it's not an immediate fix, but hopefully we can schedule that very soon because

429
00:33:50,305 --> 00:33:54,308
[SPEAKER_08]: we're able to leave with actual action items that we can follow up on.

430
00:33:54,689 --> 00:34:01,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Because otherwise, like you said, we can vote tonight, we can end up on an email chain, we can end up on a paper trail, and we can end up with nothing.

431
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:09,602
[SPEAKER_08]: So at least if we have that meeting, we can have those conversations and have those concrete steps, because there's no denying it's a serious issue there.

432
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:11,903
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a matter of how fast we're gonna act on it.

433
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:13,445
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you all for coming out.

434
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:14,746
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Mr. President?

435
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:15,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Council Meeks.

436
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:24,552
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, we also just got a correspondence from the mayor stating that the safe routes to schools at the Brooks was recently completed.

437
00:34:25,492 --> 00:34:34,198
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would challenge that, Mr. President, because I don't think creating one route to a school, which there was some improvements made along High Street.

438
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:37,619
[SPEAKER_19]: without a doubt, some great improvements.

439
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:43,202
[SPEAKER_19]: But clearly, when you look in the neighborhood, I grew up off Irving Street, so I'm very familiar with the area.

440
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:50,105
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can tell you firsthand, Mr. President, many of those roads have been neglected for many, many years.

441
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:56,869
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think what you're seeing right now is a culmination of many years of neglect.

442
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:00,911
[SPEAKER_19]: And by no means would you consider this safe routes to school.

443
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:01,591
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

444
00:35:06,943 --> 00:35:09,165
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair recognizes Councilor Caravaglio.

445
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:10,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

446
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:10,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

447
00:35:11,006 --> 00:35:14,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, we've all had some great ideas here tonight.

448
00:35:15,168 --> 00:35:17,390
[SPEAKER_15]: We're into almost at the end of October.

449
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,650
[SPEAKER_15]: and construction season is going to be ending real soon.

450
00:35:21,511 --> 00:35:23,532
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's going to be the problem.

451
00:35:23,813 --> 00:35:26,335
[SPEAKER_15]: These people are going to have to wait till next year to get this fixed.

452
00:35:26,355 --> 00:35:36,823
[SPEAKER_15]: So though the meeting is great, I think the DBW should be down there tomorrow to make an assessment, because some of that stuff can be done fairly quickly.

453
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:43,548
[SPEAKER_15]: It isn't that hard of a job to put a sidewalk in in a few days.

454
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,831
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, if we do a meeting,

455
00:35:47,505 --> 00:36:01,798
[SPEAKER_15]: the the it will be too cold to put to put the cement down on top of whatever they're going to put down there and they say they'll be left in the lurch until springtime so I'd ask that this be sent to the mayor's office to have the dbw down there.

456
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:13,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Before the end of the week look at this and have a report issued to us by next meeting these people will have some kind of answer on where they stand on getting this this street.

457
00:36:14,435 --> 00:36:25,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Even not so much as three but at least the sidewalks put into somewhat working order, because, again, they'll just it'll just leave you around for next year, and they'll and they'll suffer all winter.

458
00:36:25,986 --> 00:36:30,771
[SPEAKER_15]: So they'll dub and people just keep talking on the sidewalk so it's only going to get worse.

459
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:34,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr President, chair recognizes Council this.

460
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:36,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:39,926
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll be brief, because I know you have things you want to say too.

462
00:36:40,926 --> 00:36:45,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Certainly I support what Councilor Carviello said, there should be some sort of emergency addressing the issue.

463
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:49,334
[SPEAKER_14]: But as you know, that'll be a short-term fix because it's a serious problem.

464
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:54,019
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to add context, and I appreciate the context that Councilor Marks added earlier.

465
00:36:55,857 --> 00:37:00,839
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're talking about drainage and new sidewalks on the road, we're talking about a full rebuild, right?

466
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:02,680
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about a full rebuild of that stretch.

467
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:07,443
[SPEAKER_14]: That's in the millions of dollars, you know, if we're going into the catch basins.

468
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:22,410
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to provide you context, and I know, because it's an important discussion that we're having as a community, we just had a report issued, roads and sidewalks report, that says we have over a hundred million dollars in roads and sidewalk backlog just to get up to

469
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,031
[SPEAKER_14]: to a standard level.

470
00:37:24,691 --> 00:37:30,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Our road repair budget is about, and I think road and sidewalks together, it's about a million to a million and a half dollars a year.

471
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:32,197
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a budget issue.

472
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:33,558
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a resources issue.

473
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:35,079
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we talk about neglect,

474
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:41,400
[SPEAKER_14]: It's neglect all over the city for decades where we've been deeply underfunding this question of safe roads and sidewalks.

475
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,221
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to put that figure out there.

476
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:47,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So you understand, we have a huge problem across the city.

477
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:51,808
[SPEAKER_14]: We're putting, you know, if we have the budget we have now, we'll solve it in a hundred years.

478
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,550
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we know, things are gonna get worse.

479
00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:57,773
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, that's not, we're never gonna, a hundred years, we'll never solve that problem.

480
00:37:57,813 --> 00:38:04,318
[SPEAKER_14]: So it really is a huge budget question of what the city is doing to address this massive backlog of road and sidewalk issues.

481
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:14,369
[SPEAKER_14]: So I certainly support an urgent fix to try to get one foot deep sinkholes in front of homes, obviously, and having a site visit to see what we can do.

482
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:23,680
[SPEAKER_14]: But the real question is this broader question of how are we going to fix hundred plus million dollars of road and sidewalk backlog that's gone neglected for many decades.

483
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,142
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to put that out there.

484
00:38:26,911 --> 00:38:28,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Mr. President.

485
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:29,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

486
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:37,118
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Baird is correct, but the city does have linkage funding that we can use for infrastructure improvement.

487
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:46,925
[SPEAKER_19]: The city does have water and sewer enterprise account money, well over $6 million in surplus money that can be used for drainage.

488
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:48,106
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what the money's there for.

489
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:48,266
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

490
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:53,150
[SPEAKER_19]: And so there is money available to attend to these projects.

491
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,894
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the fact that there's no plan currently in the community to address these issues.

492
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:07,901
[SPEAKER_19]: So if residents can look and say, here's the list of projects that are on the list and your project is scheduled for this, this and this, then they'd have some type of idea.

493
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:15,768
[SPEAKER_19]: But as we heard already from residents that are going to see click fix or reporting it to the city administration, they don't even get a call back.

494
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:22,412
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think part of the disconnect is that there's nowhere to go to find where you are if you are on a list.

495
00:39:22,872 --> 00:39:27,515
[SPEAKER_19]: And secondly, what may be available because there is funding available.

496
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:35,080
[SPEAKER_19]: We just got, I think it was Councilor Falco mentioned about the $48 million in the different uses that we're getting from the federal government.

497
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,262
[SPEAKER_19]: And one is for road and infrastructure improvements.

498
00:39:39,362 --> 00:39:41,704
[SPEAKER_19]: $48 million, and there's no plan.

499
00:39:42,064 --> 00:39:44,765
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, Councilor Falco could talk about it better than I can.

500
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:49,128
[SPEAKER_19]: There's currently no plan, but this is the money that's out there.

501
00:39:49,168 --> 00:39:52,870
[SPEAKER_19]: The 6 million in water and sewer enterprise account is your money.

502
00:39:53,390 --> 00:40:05,697
[SPEAKER_19]: It's an over-assessment for water and sewer, not to address sidewalks, but infrastructure, because the sidewalks is probably the cheapest thing, doing the drainage and so forth is the most expensive, but we have money there.

503
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:09,280
[SPEAKER_19]: So some of it is a disconnect, Mr. President.

504
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,963
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't want residents to believe that we're never going to be able to get through this.

505
00:40:13,364 --> 00:40:14,405
[SPEAKER_19]: There's money available.

506
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:18,148
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a matter of having a plan and working methodically through the plan.

507
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:19,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

508
00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:22,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Commitment to investing in delivery of city and school services.

509
00:40:22,893 --> 00:40:23,313
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

510
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,235
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair recognizes Councilor Falcone.

511
00:40:25,275 --> 00:40:26,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

512
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank all my colleagues.

513
00:40:28,198 --> 00:40:31,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone had valuable suggestions.

514
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:33,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank the residents for coming down tonight.

515
00:40:33,383 --> 00:40:40,609
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the most important part is you coming down and letting us know what's going on on your street because you're the closest to it.

516
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:43,672
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the issues, the problems, what needs to be addressed.

517
00:40:45,774 --> 00:40:48,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Beerson mentioned budgeting and budget issues.

518
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:51,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course that's always a concern, but safety is the number one concern.

519
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:55,518
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make sure that that street is safe for everyone that traverses it.

520
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:57,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, it's near a school.

521
00:40:57,979 --> 00:40:59,840
[SPEAKER_05]: That's always a huge concern.

522
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,701
[SPEAKER_05]: You have kids coming back and forth up and down the street all day.

523
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:04,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to make sure everyone's safe.

524
00:41:05,142 --> 00:41:07,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned the onsite meeting.

525
00:41:08,453 --> 00:41:10,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I am 100% support of that.

526
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:22,151
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best way to get something like this done is to have all the department heads on site so you can talk to them, you can ask them questions, and then everybody leaves that meeting knowing what they need to do.

527
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:24,306
[SPEAKER_05]: and they hear it directly from you.

528
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:26,508
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the most important things we can do.

529
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,951
[SPEAKER_05]: We did that in other neighborhoods and it was very successful.

530
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:29,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked really well.

531
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:33,815
[SPEAKER_05]: And I second the motion of Councilor Scott Pelley for doing that.

532
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:38,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask Mr. President, if you could schedule that as soon as possible, that is vital.

533
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:46,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some things I'm sure that we could probably do right away, you know, looking at the stop signs, you know, painting stops, lines on the ground, stuff like that.

534
00:41:47,368 --> 00:41:57,670
[SPEAKER_05]: That's simple stuff, but the longer term issues like drainage, sidewalks, that might be long term, but we need to make sure it gets on.

535
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,874
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to make sure that the DPW knows about it.

536
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:04,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that the city engineer be invited to that meeting as well.

537
00:42:05,276 --> 00:42:13,459
[SPEAKER_05]: That is important that he's invited because when we talk about drainage, he needs to be part of that conversation.

538
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,681
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of drainage issues throughout this community.

539
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,443
[SPEAKER_05]: More and more when it rains, there's more and more flooding.

540
00:42:20,483 --> 00:42:25,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if you have flooding down in that area, but I know surrounding streets, I was down at a playstate in Usher,

541
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,118
[SPEAKER_05]: That was like a three foot swell.

542
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of issues that need to be addressed, but that onsite meeting is key.

543
00:42:35,082 --> 00:42:44,328
[SPEAKER_05]: With regard to council, Mark said mentioned ARPA, there are ARPA funds available for infrastructure projects, especially if we're working on, you know, water main type stuff underneath the street.

544
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:49,271
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe if it's due for an upgrade, maybe there's funding for that, but we would have to look into that further.

545
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:51,472
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city engineer needs to be at that meeting.

546
00:42:51,932 --> 00:42:57,660
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as DPW, Memphis Police, Traffic Engineer, they all need to be invited.

547
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,206
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's key that they're there, you're there as well to ask the questions.

548
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:07,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said, everybody leaves the meeting knowing what needs to be done and what department heads need to work on what.

549
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:11,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that Mister President, if you could schedule that soon.

550
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:17,925
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have to remember that we do have an outstanding meeting with the residents on Cotting Street as well.

551
00:43:18,845 --> 00:43:21,086
[SPEAKER_05]: That neighborhood is still waiting for their meeting.

552
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:22,286
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a couple of these now.

553
00:43:22,326 --> 00:43:32,388
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure if we can maybe do them on a Saturday, both on one day, but- Councilor Fevella, the problem is getting the Saturday meetings with the traffic engineer and everybody.

554
00:43:33,048 --> 00:43:34,369
[SPEAKER_15]: seems to be an issue right now.

555
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:39,630
[SPEAKER_15]: And in a couple of weeks, we're going to be turning the clocks back, and the 4 o'clock is going to be docked there.

556
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:45,412
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would even welcome doing it Sunday, if we get them down there on a Sunday also.

557
00:43:46,053 --> 00:43:49,214
[SPEAKER_05]: The bottom line is we just need to do it sooner than later.

558
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:50,514
[SPEAKER_05]: This really needs to be addressed.

559
00:43:50,534 --> 00:43:51,795
[SPEAKER_05]: These are safety concerns.

560
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:52,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

561
00:43:52,955 --> 00:43:58,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I would just second Councilor Caravello's motion on the emergency fix by the end of the week.

562
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caravello is the president who will be scheduling the meeting, so I think that is good.

563
00:44:02,862 --> 00:44:05,844
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can get that emergency order over there to the DPW tomorrow.

564
00:44:05,884 --> 00:44:07,806
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a good cause of action as well.

565
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:12,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Did I hear that Councilor Scott Bailey had a point of information?

566
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:16,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco, I do believe you're still on the floor.

567
00:44:18,428 --> 00:44:18,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

568
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:19,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to make sure.

569
00:44:19,889 --> 00:44:27,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So as far as the offsite meeting or onsite meeting, I should say, so do we have the traffic engineer DPW met for police engineer?

570
00:44:27,355 --> 00:44:32,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, disability disability.

571
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:32,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

572
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:35,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

573
00:44:36,782 --> 00:44:38,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

574
00:44:38,423 --> 00:44:39,624
[SPEAKER_05]: And representative of the mayor's office.

575
00:44:39,864 --> 00:44:41,145
[SPEAKER_13]: I do think it's an enforcement issue.

576
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:43,026
[SPEAKER_13]: So traffic and parking should be there.

577
00:44:43,386 --> 00:44:43,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

578
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,348
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a new traffic, uh,

579
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:48,409
[SPEAKER_13]: manager of a new in-house parking.

580
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:52,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Program so she started yesterday they Morrison.

581
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:59,054
[SPEAKER_13]: So they welcome aboard is the second day of the job and we have some work to do.

582
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:12,399
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said I believe that everybody here in the audience said the opportunity to speak once it's wanted to is there anybody on the computer I just want to say that anybody in the computer that has not the opportunity to speak first.

583
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,821
[SPEAKER_13]: I see my friend Jake I'm asking on the computer doesn't want to speak.

584
00:45:17,085 --> 00:45:19,507
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we have a couple of people here.

585
00:45:19,567 --> 00:45:21,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Not just everybody had an opportunity to go once.

586
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:26,353
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to say, please step right up and name and address for the record.

587
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:27,514
[SPEAKER_13]: If you haven't had a chance to speak yet.

588
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:28,114
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

589
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:36,301
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosie, if you had a chance to say, well, I wanted to say it's parking on the sidewalk is illegal, but what force do I have?

590
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:39,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to ask, I mean, call the police and I'm ready to take it.

591
00:45:40,861 --> 00:45:42,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, we can call the non-emergency line.

592
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:45,463
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so they can come by and take it.

593
00:45:45,503 --> 00:45:46,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's an enforcement issue.

594
00:45:46,504 --> 00:45:47,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Down the street.

595
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:48,244
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

596
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:49,045
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an enforcement issue.

597
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,086
[SPEAKER_13]: I drive the street every morning taking my kids to school.

598
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,587
[SPEAKER_13]: I know exactly what you're talking about.

599
00:45:52,607 --> 00:45:53,527
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a battle.

600
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:54,547
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'll be brief.

601
00:45:54,908 --> 00:45:55,868
[SPEAKER_10]: My name's Christina Roberts.

602
00:45:55,928 --> 00:45:57,569
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm at 21 Brooks.

603
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:00,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you guys for hearing us in such large numbers.

604
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:03,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I took a couple pictures of walking my kindergartner to school.

605
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:07,373
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to go like out in the middle of the road where people turn off High Street.

606
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:11,015
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd, yeah, we'd just love to be able to walk down the street.

607
00:46:11,095 --> 00:46:11,935
[SPEAKER_10]: So thanks for listening.

608
00:46:12,276 --> 00:46:14,096
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

609
00:46:15,737 --> 00:46:16,797
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to add.

610
00:46:16,817 --> 00:46:17,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

611
00:46:18,098 --> 00:46:18,658
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I'm sorry.

612
00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:20,759
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Catherine Narita at 7 Alston Court.

613
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:23,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And so Rosie's absolutely right.

614
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:32,144
[SPEAKER_12]: People should not be parking on the sidewalk, but I also can understand why they're parking on the sidewalk because the road is too narrow to not park on the sidewalk.

615
00:46:32,204 --> 00:46:37,086
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it was one way, this would be, and we had sidewalks, it would be a whole lot less of an issue.

616
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:39,431
[SPEAKER_17]: The chair recognizes Councilor Scott Kellogg.

617
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,786
[SPEAKER_02]: be a two lane road.

618
00:46:48,866 --> 00:46:54,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it should be one direction or where it could start going into two directions.

619
00:46:54,349 --> 00:47:00,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we could, that's something that, that's why we want everybody there because I can feel your frustration that where is the meeting?

620
00:47:00,472 --> 00:47:00,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we go?

621
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:02,794
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't can't do it here, where do we go?

622
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:07,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to do now is we're bringing the meeting to you and let's get all your neighbors out.

623
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:14,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get everybody out and let's let's let them speak because unfortunately some people there's actions when there's a crowd around them.

624
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's what we have to do, that's what we have to do.

625
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:22,442
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, you know, my wife gets mad because I can't go apple picking again, but it's fine.

626
00:47:22,702 --> 00:47:23,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate apples.

627
00:47:23,443 --> 00:47:24,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So, thank you.

628
00:47:35,925 --> 00:47:40,969
[SPEAKER_20]: The other issue is that there are no curves with people parking on the sidewalk.

629
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:44,372
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can't even tell you're parking on the sidewalk there.

630
00:47:44,872 --> 00:47:46,254
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's another issue.

631
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:53,660
[SPEAKER_20]: And when we talk about decades, I've lived on that street for six and nothing's ever been done, ever.

632
00:47:54,797 --> 00:48:06,008
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, the last thing was done was when they ripped up the streets to put the pipes in, the gas pipes in.

633
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:10,112
[SPEAKER_20]: And when they redid the streets, they didn't do it right.

634
00:48:10,813 --> 00:48:15,657
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the issue with them coming apart at the sidewalk.

635
00:48:16,098 --> 00:48:17,539
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you all for hearing us.

636
00:48:18,966 --> 00:48:21,548
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a cozy neighborhood, it looks like.

637
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:24,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's all tight and cooped together.

638
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:28,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, my name is Ray-Ray Gilder, and I live at 19 Burke Street.

639
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:37,738
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying, if a car was driving the usual speed it is, and when I fell out of my house and I smashed myself, a car could have hit me, okay?

640
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:39,479
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a real deal for me.

641
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,742
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've always known it's been a concern since I lived there.

642
00:48:43,662 --> 00:48:47,743
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just know that you guys are the interim people.

643
00:48:48,023 --> 00:48:48,623
[SPEAKER_09]: I get that.

644
00:48:49,083 --> 00:48:59,606
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really hope they take it seriously because nobody wants to hear of anybody dying, especially a little kid, simply because there's a divot in the road that they could have fixed.

645
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:00,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Understood.

646
00:49:00,986 --> 00:49:01,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

647
00:49:01,226 --> 00:49:03,747
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Carviello, as amended by

648
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:15,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli for a site visit, COW, as further amended by Councilor Caravaglio for the DPW to take immediate emergency action.

649
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:18,276
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

650
00:49:19,357 --> 00:49:20,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

651
00:49:20,598 --> 00:49:21,319
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed.

652
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:23,582
[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it.

653
00:49:24,723 --> 00:49:25,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

654
00:49:25,024 --> 00:49:25,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks for coming.

655
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:26,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, everyone.

656
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:28,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

657
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:31,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Paper 21594 offered by Councilor Falco.

658
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:35,991
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved, the Parks Commission be invited to participate in the car park revitalization meetings.

659
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,453
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

660
00:49:39,774 --> 00:49:42,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

661
00:49:42,676 --> 00:49:43,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

662
00:49:43,816 --> 00:49:49,400
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been many meetings so far with regard to the car park revitalization.

663
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the key, I think,

664
00:49:54,718 --> 00:49:57,861
[SPEAKER_05]: know, boards that really should be involved in this is the parks commission.

665
00:49:58,422 --> 00:49:59,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have not been involved in it.

666
00:49:59,984 --> 00:50:07,552
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm basically asking that the group that is actually having these meetings invite the parks commission to the meeting.

667
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:13,678
[SPEAKER_05]: When you think about at the end of the day, the parks commission knows the needs of the parks, the scheduling of the parks,

668
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:18,620
[SPEAKER_05]: what the demands are as far as scheduling and so forth.

669
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:24,762
[SPEAKER_05]: So they really should be part of this process and in the interest of transparency, they should be invited to these meetings.

670
00:50:25,323 --> 00:50:32,205
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd ask that the parks commission be invited to all future meetings with regard to car park revitalization.

671
00:50:32,825 --> 00:50:33,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Move approval.

672
00:50:33,786 --> 00:50:34,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

673
00:50:34,246 --> 00:50:36,168
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an excellent recommendation.

674
00:50:36,228 --> 00:50:44,455
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco and it's my hope also that we get a response from the administration in short order relative to our request for an advisor's advisory committee relative to that project as well.

675
00:50:44,895 --> 00:50:48,077
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

676
00:50:48,218 --> 00:50:49,018
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

677
00:50:49,298 --> 00:50:49,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

678
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:50,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

679
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:52,261
[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it.

680
00:50:52,621 --> 00:50:54,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair awaits a motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

681
00:50:55,984 --> 00:50:56,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to take papers.

682
00:50:56,905 --> 00:50:57,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

683
00:50:58,253 --> 00:51:03,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Papers in the hands of the clerk, Council Paper 21597, offered by Council President Caraviello.

684
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:13,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved, the Medford City Council have the construction firm doing the work on Prescott Street, remove the trailer and backhoe equipment from the sidewalk on the corner of Alston Street in the interest of public safety.

685
00:51:13,842 --> 00:51:15,663
[SPEAKER_13]: The chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

686
00:51:16,084 --> 00:51:16,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

687
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:22,087
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're going from one end of the street to the other end of the street, which is

688
00:51:24,153 --> 00:51:27,415
[SPEAKER_15]: on the corner of Prescott and Austin.

689
00:51:28,055 --> 00:51:31,737
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you brought this up a couple of weeks ago about all the equipment that was left there.

690
00:51:31,757 --> 00:51:33,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, it was gone for about a week.

691
00:51:33,638 --> 00:51:37,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the backhoe is back there and the other things are back there.

692
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:50,727
[SPEAKER_15]: But my concern is on the corner of Austin and Prescott, Newport Construction has decided to park a trailer blocking the whole sidewalk and along with putting backhoe parts on there.

693
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,528
[SPEAKER_15]: And right down the street is senior housing.

694
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:59,713
[SPEAKER_15]: So bad enough they can't walk on the street because the street's all dug up and now they can't even walk on the sidewalk.

695
00:52:00,614 --> 00:52:07,239
[SPEAKER_15]: I did call the engineer on Friday and I asked him to have them immediately remove it.

696
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:10,762
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what he did, but obviously it's still there.

697
00:52:11,203 --> 00:52:19,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I did call the code enforcement officer to have it removed, still there.

698
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,712
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think at this point,

699
00:52:22,712 --> 00:52:25,535
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what the next course of action is.

700
00:52:25,635 --> 00:52:27,857
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been sitting there since last week.

701
00:52:28,637 --> 00:52:34,902
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see the seniors that are walking now, they're walking in the middle of a broken up street.

702
00:52:35,683 --> 00:52:37,284
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just not fair.

703
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:41,668
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, it has to be removed immediately.

704
00:52:43,472 --> 00:52:50,919
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do believe Councilor Carvillo, as you stated yesterday when we were discussing this, that it does pose a public safety risk to the residents of 22 Alston Street.

705
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:59,926
[SPEAKER_13]: The question of whether or not fire apparatus and emergency equipment can traverse the lane with the way that the equipment is positioned is certainly concerning.

706
00:53:01,868 --> 00:53:04,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falcone.

707
00:53:04,414 --> 00:53:05,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

708
00:53:05,074 --> 00:53:07,136
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna thank Councilor Caviello for bringing this forward.

709
00:53:07,176 --> 00:53:14,921
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in that neighborhood today and you are correct, it has not been moved and it is a public safety hazard and definitely narrows the road.

710
00:53:14,981 --> 00:53:17,803
[SPEAKER_05]: It's dangerous, it's near the school, it needs to be removed.

711
00:53:17,823 --> 00:53:20,705
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thank the councilor for bringing it forward and I move approval.

712
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:21,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

713
00:53:22,126 --> 00:53:23,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recommends Councilor Marks.

714
00:53:23,747 --> 00:53:24,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

715
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:27,849
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanna thank President Caviello for bringing this up.

716
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:32,713
[SPEAKER_19]: And as you mentioned, Mr. President, this was brought up over a week ago.

717
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:39,905
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have yet to receive any type of response from the city administration or any action regarding this.

718
00:53:40,305 --> 00:53:43,147
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a very important public safety issue.

719
00:53:43,648 --> 00:53:54,798
[SPEAKER_19]: It may not seem so, but these construction companies, these utility companies are coming into this community and they're running roughshod across the community.

720
00:53:55,058 --> 00:53:55,618
[SPEAKER_19]: They really are.

721
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:58,261
[SPEAKER_19]: They're working at their own pace.

722
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:00,883
[SPEAKER_19]: They're putting their equipment wherever they want.

723
00:54:01,403 --> 00:54:04,545
[SPEAKER_19]: and to the neglect of our community.

724
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:06,586
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's no oversight.

725
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:07,847
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no enforcement.

726
00:54:08,167 --> 00:54:09,568
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's a concern, Mr. President.

727
00:54:09,908 --> 00:54:13,350
[SPEAKER_19]: And because of all the construction, it's happening everywhere in our community.

728
00:54:14,291 --> 00:54:19,574
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would hope that the city administration act pretty quickly on these public safety concerns.

729
00:54:19,614 --> 00:54:19,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

730

[SPEAKER_13]: The ayes have it.

735
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:39,239
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the longest thing on the paper, now you're going to make me read this thing.

736
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,762
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't read it, it's mine, it's mine.

737
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:08,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

767
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that changed for the primary.

768
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:54,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a robocall that's going to be going out for those people that, basically everyone in Ward 2, Precinct 1, since some people may not have voted in the primary, I would think another robocall should be going out.

769
00:58:54,939 --> 00:58:56,319
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be another one going out, yes.

770
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there will be a robocall going out?

771
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there will be another robocall going out on that, yes.

772
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:01,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

773
00:59:04,022 --> 00:59:08,883
[SPEAKER_13]: I do think it might make sense if we're gonna do a robocall, that we do a robocall across the whole city and tell everybody where they vote.

774
00:59:09,704 --> 00:59:12,666
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if we have the capability and capacity to do it, it might make sense, right?

775
00:59:12,686 --> 00:59:17,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Saying, Hey, you know, Adam heard of these would do one new vote at the firefighters club.

776
00:59:17,089 --> 00:59:21,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Just something to throw out there.

777
00:59:21,632 --> 00:59:28,936
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm correct, this is the first municipal election where the residents in three, one will be, will not be voting at LMH.

778
00:59:28,976 --> 00:59:29,797
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll be voting at.

779
00:59:30,508 --> 00:59:33,190
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, the, uh, yeah.

780
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:40,053
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would think that, you know, they should probably get a robocall as well, since this is the first municipal election.

781
00:59:40,133 --> 00:59:49,959
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can interrupt for a second, I apologize for interrupting, but we're required to notify voters when we change the polling place, which is, which is why we have to do the reverse 9-1-1 anyway.

782
00:59:49,999 --> 00:59:54,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did that for when we moved from Lawrence Memorial to the American Legion, we did that as well.

783
00:59:55,922 --> 01:00:03,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can request from the administration any robocall you would like, but we are required to do one for the Roberts.

784
01:00:04,285 --> 01:00:04,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

785
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:07,046
[SPEAKER_13]: I would make the suggestion that citywide then.

786
01:00:07,526 --> 01:00:07,746
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

787
01:00:08,647 --> 01:00:17,670
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Vice President Knight and amended by Councilor Falco.

791
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:40,211
[SPEAKER_19]: And the motion was to do a citywide robocall, correct?

792
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:40,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

793
01:00:41,112 --> 01:00:41,873
[SPEAKER_13]: And approve, right?

794
01:00:41,893 --> 01:00:45,315
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, approve the polling locations and do the robocall.

795
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:47,637
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.

796
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:58,480

822
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:03,686
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't, but I could not get it.

823
01:02:04,046 --> 01:02:06,728

824

[SPEAKER_15]: I do not have the...

825
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:14,864

826
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:17,626
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion to take a five minute recess.

827
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:25,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think we need to do that, Mr. President, but if I remember correctly, I think this is the paper that creates the caps for the station manager.

828
01:02:25,352 --> 01:02:25,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

829
01:02:26,112 --> 01:02:29,815
