00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:16,196
It's humbling to be here today with all of you on this National Day of Action to lift up the legacy of Congressman John Lewis, a man of deep faith who made his life a living sermon on courage, on conscience, and on commitment to justice.

2
00:00:17,337 --> 00:00:29,741
Good Trouble Lives On is not just a slogan, it is a call to everyone to pick up the torch that John Lewis carried through Selma, through the halls of Congress, and through the hearts of generations.

3
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:44,011
And while many think of that torch as one that burned in the streets, or the courts, or through our voting booths, I want to talk to you today about another battlefield where good trouble must be made, and that is in our schools.

4
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:58,563
I'm hesitant to use the language of a battle, given our commitment to nonviolent protests, but make no mistake,

5
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,380
The attacks on education we are seeing across the country are not accidental.

6
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,921
They are deliberate.

7
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:07,221
They are strategic.

8
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:13,682
They are meant to keep our young people from knowing the truth, from knowing their power, and from knowing each other.

9
00:01:15,003 --> 00:01:15,683
Let me be clear.

10
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:18,644
Education is not neutral.

11
00:01:19,644 --> 00:01:22,565
It either affirms our humanity or denies it.

12
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:26,305
It either tells the truth or it erases it.

13
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:28,466
It either opens doors

14
00:01:29,275 --> 00:01:30,216
or locks them shut.

15
00:01:31,616 --> 00:01:47,845
Right now, in state houses and school boards across the country, we are witnessing attempts to turn classrooms into those battlegrounds, banning books, silencing teachers, and criminalizing honest conversations about race, gender, sexuality, and history.

16
00:01:49,366 --> 00:01:53,548
In some places, students are being told they cannot speak their own identities aloud.

17
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:56,990
Teachers are being told they cannot name systems of oppression,

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,846
And entire communities and cultures are being told their stories don't belong on the page or in the lesson plan.

19
00:02:05,827 --> 00:02:07,328
This is not just censorship.

20
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:09,429
This is cultural control.

21
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,772
This is not just about curriculum.

22
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:14,674
This is about power.

23
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:21,719
And it's our job, our moral obligation, to get into good trouble to resist it.

24
00:02:30,937 --> 00:02:35,681
As a member of the Medford School Committee, I take this responsibility very seriously.

25
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:41,845
I know that local school boards are often the first line of defense and the first source of the resistance.

26
00:02:42,626 --> 00:02:49,471
When we talk about protecting democracy, we cannot overlook our responsibility to protect educational freedom.

27
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,374
And that means defending truth-telling in our classrooms.

28
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:59,338
It means making sure students learn not just the dates of the Civil Rights Movement,

29
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:03,079
but the genesis and the spirit of the civil rights movement.

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,182
It means making sure that we all understand why people marched and why we're marching still.

31
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:13,744
It means that black history is not confined to February.

32
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:18,806
It means that indigenous voices are not confined to footnotes.

33
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:22,747
It means that queer kids are not asked to disappear.

34
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:27,329
It means that immigrant children are not asked to forget where they came from.

35
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:37,230
We don't need sanitized history.

36
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,691
We need honest history.

37
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:44,574
Because only when we confront the truth can we transform it.

38
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:49,298
And friends, this is not just an urban or southern problem.

39
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:56,342
These battles are happening right here in Massachusetts, in the greater Boston area, in my home city of Medford.

40
00:03:57,563 --> 00:04:00,205
So the simple question we must ask ourselves is this.

41
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,242
What side of history are we writing and who gets to hold the pen?

42
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:12,765
For me, as a young black elected official, I know the stakes.

43
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:17,467
I know what it means to sit in a classroom and not see yourself reflected.

44
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:24,229
I know what it feels like when your identity is treated as an afterthought or as a threat.

45
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,592
And I know what it means to finally find your voice and to have someone try to take it away.

46
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:33,394
That's why I ran for school committee.

47
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:41,740
That's why I fight for equitable funding, for an inclusive curriculum, for culturally responsible and responsive teaching practices.

48
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:50,326
And that's why I'm working to ensure our schools are brave spaces where all young people feel safe, seen, and supported.

49
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:55,630
Because, my friends, the public school classroom is where justice begins.

50
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:09,596
The classroom is where young people first learn the language of their rights.

51
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:13,940
The classroom is where they first learn to challenge assumptions.

52
00:05:14,941 --> 00:05:19,584
The classroom is where they first learn that silence is not the same as peace.

53
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:23,107
And that change is something that they can create.

54
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,332
And if that makes some people uncomfortable, good.

55
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:33,195
John Lewis didn't make people comfortable.

56
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,266
He made them think.

57
00:05:36,147 --> 00:05:37,588
He inspired them to act.

58
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:40,931
He troubled them to feel the urgency of now.

59
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:52,701
So let us feel that urgency today, five years after his passing, and carry forward his legacy with boldness, with clarity, and with courage.

60
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:57,685
Let us refuse to allow injustice to be taught as neutrality.

61
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,729
Let us refuse to be quiet while others try to erase our stories.

62
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,961
Let us refuse to seed the minds of the next generation to fear and falsehoods.

63
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:16,423
Let us instead build schools where freedom is not just a unit in the textbook, but a living, breathing reality in the lives of every single student.

64
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:18,344
We're out, we're out, we're out.

65
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:31,687
If John Lewis taught us anything, it's that democracy is not a given, it is an act.

66
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:34,744
And I'd add, so is education.

67
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:40,166
It is an act of hope, an act of resistance, an act of imagination.

68
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:56,474
So today, as we march, as we speak, as we organize, let's commit to bringing good trouble into every space, every space where injustice hides, especially into the classroom, that shape our children's futures.

69
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,936
We honor John Lewis not just by remembering what he fought for,

70
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:02,878
but by continuing to fight.

71
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:12,865
So let's get into good trouble for truth, for justice, for education, and for every student still waiting for the world to reflect their worth.

72
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:14,406
Thank you.

73
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,128
Let's get into some good trouble together.
