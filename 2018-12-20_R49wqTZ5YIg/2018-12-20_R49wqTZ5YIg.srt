[SPEAKER_06]: When we sat on meetings with beautiful music and all of you donating your time to play for us and the community, just really puts a big smile on my face.

73
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:53,842
[SPEAKER_06]: I love to hear you all play, and it's especially important to me because this is one of the few times that we get to hear Mr. Zigny play as well, and he's not just conducting.

74
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:59,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I open the door and I heard the music, the minute you open the door, it goes all the way through City Hall.

[SPEAKER_06]: It just puts a big smile on everybody's face.

[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

87
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:48,580

88
00:38:50,768 --> 00:39:03,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Towards the back, we were talking about the 5013Cs and how the superintendent assigned her new executive assistant, Emily, to work that.

89
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:16,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I was wondering if we could add to that, and I don't know if it's allowed, to just give us a report at the end of February to just see how it's going and making sure she's not overwhelmed and, you know, just a little add-on.

90
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:18,363

00:42:55,897 --> 00:42:59,778
[SPEAKER_18]: two parents of both elementary and high school age students.

161
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:05,920
[SPEAKER_18]: We had three Medford police officers, Lieutenant Covino, Officer Ziobro, and Officer Lokowitz.

162
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:13,903
[SPEAKER_18]: The director of buildings and grounds was in attendance, director of nursing, the high school principal, and the assistant superintendent, Miss Patterson.

163
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:19,124
[SPEAKER_18]: So we had a good representation of everyone at the high school building.

164
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:24,966
[SPEAKER_18]: First item that Officer Ziobro shared with us is that he does attend

165
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:33,565
[SPEAKER_18]: monthly meetings with the community-based justice coalition with the assistant district attorney.

166
00:43:34,185 --> 00:43:46,228
[SPEAKER_18]: The director of nursing, Toni Wray, also attends, and it's to address high-level risk situations and highly troubled students that they are paying attention to.

167
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:53,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Second was the safe haven report at that time was not released to the public.

168
00:43:54,184 --> 00:43:59,888
[SPEAKER_18]: It was understood that it is a Department of Homeland Security document and it is a privileged document.

169
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:04,987
[SPEAKER_18]: Parts that can be shared will be shared when it is available.

170
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:10,932
[SPEAKER_18]: Third was all the cameras have been fixed or are currently being fixed.

171
00:44:11,212 --> 00:44:17,537
[SPEAKER_18]: So all the cameras in all of the school buildings are fixed or are on a list to be fixed happening currently.

172
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:20,420
[SPEAKER_18]: Next, oh, some question was asked.

173
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:26,465
[SPEAKER_18]: There are 95 cameras on the high school campus, and it is privileged information where they are.

174
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:33,676
[SPEAKER_18]: The other concern parents had was the doors being marked from the outside of the school buildings.

175
00:44:34,376 --> 00:44:42,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Currently, there are doors that were unmarked that are now being marked by Mr. McLaughlin.

176
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:51,745
[SPEAKER_18]: The next highlight was that Mr. DeLava shared that on November 6, there was a training about safety care for kids in crisis.

177
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:55,467
[SPEAKER_18]: He wanted to thank the Medford Police Department for their continuing

178
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,576
[SPEAKER_18]: training and building relationships with students.

179
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:11,721
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. DeLeva also shared that dogs from area police departments and the state police came to do some training in the building, both for drugs and ballistics.

180
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:20,304
[SPEAKER_18]: We did learn that different dogs are trained for specific sins, differing between drug paraphernalia and ballistics.

181
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:32,260
[SPEAKER_18]: We did, after the safety update, we did discuss the feminine hygiene products being installed in the high school, and that will be in a follow-up report with Ms.

182
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,181
[SPEAKER_18]: Diane Caldwell.

183
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:41,471
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if my fellow members, Erin and, I mean, Committee Member DiVenedetto and Committee Member Kreatz are both on the

184
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:47,612
[SPEAKER_18]: buildings and grout subcommittee and committee member Van der Kloot was in attendance and that is all I have to share.

185
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:48,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mayor.

186
00:45:48,232 --> 00:45:50,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman.

187
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other comments on this report?

188
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:54,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo.

189
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:57,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

190
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:04,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Will the response to the sanitary materials and bathrooms, which I don't think that's actually on the agenda, is it?

191
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:07,889
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe we should discuss it.

192
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:07,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

193
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:08,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Caldwell.

194
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:10,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

195
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:14,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mr. Russo, I'd like to thank you for bringing this to our attention earlier.

196
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:23,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have worked with some CCSR members to make sure that we have been responsive to the needs of our girls.

197
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:32,153
[SPEAKER_04]: So Director Toni Wray, who's our supervisor of nurses, and Director John McLaughlin of our buildings and grounds and I

198
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:38,144
[SPEAKER_04]: got together to resolve the concerns around sanitary products in our ladies' restrooms.

199
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:48,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It was decided that we will order five product dispensers that are coin-free and place them in the bathrooms

200
00:46:48,496 --> 00:46:49,958
[SPEAKER_04]: in the following locations.

201
00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in C building on floors 1, 2, and 3, they will be in the bathrooms outside of C building.

202
00:47:00,011 --> 00:47:04,998
[SPEAKER_04]: We will also put a dispenser in the vocational school on the second floor.

203
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:09,739
[SPEAKER_04]: and we thought it might be wise to have one in the girls' gym area as well.

204
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:13,380
[SPEAKER_04]: These products will be free to our students.

205
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Buildings and grounds will supply and fill the dispensers.

206
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:27,423
[SPEAKER_04]: The estimated cost for the dispensers of these products will be around $1,100, but then after I got the quotes from John McLaughlin, it comes to about $950.

207
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:34,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Students can still go to the nurse's office if they're by the nurse's office on the second floor.

208
00:47:34,546 --> 00:47:42,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know there's some question about whether we can fill them with tampons, but according to Director Ray, we cannot do that.

209
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,873
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm happy to announce at least we can get free products for our girls in the ladies' rooms.

210
00:47:48,593 --> 00:47:50,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to answer any questions.

211
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:50,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo.

212
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

213
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:53,296
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a lot of progress.

214
00:47:53,376 --> 00:47:54,616
[SPEAKER_12]: I really do appreciate that.

215
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:59,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Is Miss Ray here now?

216
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,573
[SPEAKER_12]: She is not.

217
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,373
[SPEAKER_12]: She says that we cannot.

218
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:17,136
[SPEAKER_12]: But in New York State, they have a law that went into effect on July 1, mandating that from sixth through 12th grade, every single bathroom have both pads and tampons for free in every public school in their state.

219
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:22,157
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're a long way from that.

220
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:28,215
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm hopeful that my work with the legislature to make this the law in Massachusetts soon will happen.

221
00:48:29,175 --> 00:48:39,904
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just wondering if we do some of what we're planning and then the legislature says we have to do effectively the same thing, will we be able to reuse what we've already done or will we have to start over?

222
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:42,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe we'd have to start over.

223
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:44,929
[SPEAKER_04]: We can look at what we've done and I think can move forward with that.

224
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:45,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

225
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, so is there a change to the

226
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,014
[SPEAKER_12]: It says it's outside the assistant principal's office.

227
00:48:51,315 --> 00:48:53,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's just the location.

228
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:56,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right outside the assistant principal's office, but it's in the ladies' rooms.

229
00:48:56,939 --> 00:48:58,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, see, that's not clear.

230
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,002
[SPEAKER_12]: It looked like it was in the hall.

231
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:00,382
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

232
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:02,624
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, this is not making sense.

233
00:49:03,965 --> 00:49:09,409
[SPEAKER_12]: And how long does it take from the furthest point on building on 1, 2, or 3?

234
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:15,707
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the furthest distance to walk to one of these within the school?

235
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:16,167
[SPEAKER_04]: A building.

236
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:19,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it depends how quickly you walk.

237
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,091
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really don't think it's a long distance.

238
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:22,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, let's say you need one of these urgently.

239
00:49:22,351 --> 00:49:24,493
[SPEAKER_12]: You're probably not running.

240
00:49:25,033 --> 00:49:26,774
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a few minutes, I would reckon.

241
00:49:26,814 --> 00:49:27,435
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about a few minutes.

242
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:28,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I still get lost at the high school.

243
00:49:28,816 --> 00:49:33,018
[SPEAKER_12]: So to me, it's like a 25-minute walk to try and figure it out.

244
00:49:33,078 --> 00:49:33,399
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, good.

245
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:34,179
[SPEAKER_12]: That's good.

246
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:34,880
[SPEAKER_12]: A couple minutes.

247
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,180
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a couple minutes.

248
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:37,861
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, that's important.

249
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:38,182
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

250
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:48,983
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess I would really like to hear a follow-up as to why tampons cannot... I mean, the dispensers themselves may not be capable of it, and so that is an issue if we need to pick a different dispenser.

251
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:57,150
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, it seems like we're making a decision for girls whether they can use pads or tampons.

252
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:02,108
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm already having that conversation with the fifth graders.

253
00:50:02,188 --> 00:50:05,790
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't think this is really a decision for the school system to decide.

254
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to speak to Ms.

255
00:50:07,852 --> 00:50:08,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray about that.

256
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:10,193
[SPEAKER_04]: I think she knows more about it than I do.

257
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:12,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can have a follow-up conversation with her.

258
00:50:12,915 --> 00:50:13,156
OK.

259
00:50:15,257 --> 00:50:17,118
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a possible answer.

260
00:50:17,138 --> 00:50:17,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

261
00:50:17,198 --> 00:50:17,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Mustone.

262
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:19,520
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know the answer.

263
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:29,067
[SPEAKER_18]: The only thing I could think of is maybe it's possible that because of toxic shock syndrome, that it's not something that the school feels comfortable, because then you'd be liable, God forbid,

264
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:36,843
[SPEAKER_18]: someone came with toxic shock syndrome.

265
00:50:37,684 --> 00:50:51,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like one of the least qualified people around this space to talk about this, but I had to learn about toxic shock syndrome in the little books that I had to read for my own child.

266
00:50:52,157 --> 00:50:54,758
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the frequency of changing them that is important.

267
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:59,460
[SPEAKER_12]: So not having them seems like we're setting ourselves up for a liability versus having them.

268
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:10,024
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't really follow the logic that not having them is better because we just want to pretend nothing's going on.

269
00:51:10,244 --> 00:51:15,526
[SPEAKER_12]: If we're putting the pads in there, then we are saying that we care about this issue.

270
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:20,928
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you make the decision as a girl to use tampons,

271
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:22,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's not our problem.

272
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:24,641
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just think that's not OK.

273
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:27,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she's going to check with the nursing department to see what's legal in masks.

274
00:51:27,565 --> 00:51:27,965
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do that.

275
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:28,706
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll follow up.

276
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:29,908
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we're different than New York.

277
00:51:29,928 --> 00:51:30,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

278
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:33,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

279
00:51:33,144 --> 00:51:33,865
[SPEAKER_16]: Van der Kloot is next.

280
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:36,987
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we need you to check into that.

281
00:51:37,108 --> 00:51:43,333
[SPEAKER_16]: We received an email just before the meeting tonight asking us why we were not providing both.

282
00:51:44,314 --> 00:51:48,417
[SPEAKER_16]: It seemed to be well thought out and certainly convincing.

283
00:51:49,618 --> 00:51:51,159
[SPEAKER_16]: And if the machine doesn't

284
00:51:52,697 --> 00:51:59,185
[SPEAKER_16]: support, there's always a little basket or something that we might be able to provide.

285
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:01,668
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you would get back to us on that.

286
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:07,355
[SPEAKER_16]: On the other hand, as you said, Paul, we're making progress, and I'm glad that we are.

287
00:52:07,656 --> 00:52:09,818
[SPEAKER_16]: And I certainly think the initial

288
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:17,846
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think the disbursement of in the locations that you described should say, let's see how it goes.

289
00:52:17,906 --> 00:52:26,673
[SPEAKER_16]: But our objective should be to provide the supplies throughout the entire schools.

290
00:52:28,235 --> 00:52:29,976
[SPEAKER_04]: You mean for middle schools as well?

291
00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:32,078
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we'll start here.

292
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:34,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think in a short time we need to evaluate it.

293
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I think that's our objective.

294
00:52:38,382 --> 00:52:40,983
[SPEAKER_16]: My objective, now that it's been raised to us, it makes a lot of sense.

295
00:52:41,063 --> 00:52:48,227
[SPEAKER_16]: So anyway, if you would get back to us on that question, and we'll... Point of information, Ms.

296
00:52:48,267 --> 00:52:48,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Mustone?

297
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:53,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Jonathan just shared that the current dispensers have dual capacity.

298
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:58,171
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the time comes that you need to dispense dual products, you can.

299
00:52:58,571 --> 00:52:58,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

300
00:52:59,212 --> 00:52:59,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

301
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:02,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

302
00:53:02,873 --> 00:53:03,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto?

303
00:53:04,825 --> 00:53:09,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I make a motion to accept this as is and revisit it in January and ask Ms.

304
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:16,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Ray to report on additional adding of other options for our students.

305
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:25,062
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion to accept this report as amended with a request for a follow-up on the status of t-cons in these machines.

306
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:26,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second, Mr. Russo?

307
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:26,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

308
00:53:27,765 --> 00:53:28,385
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

309
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:28,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

310
00:53:29,246 --> 00:53:29,946
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

311
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:30,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

312
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:35,700
[SPEAKER_07]: The Rules Subcommittee, December 3rd, 2018.

313
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:35,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

314
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Kreatz, chairwoman.

315
00:53:42,445 --> 00:53:46,848
[SPEAKER_15]: And we discussed the final draft copy function of the school committee.

316
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:51,031
[SPEAKER_15]: We were struggling with one of the functions, number five.

317
00:53:51,712 --> 00:54:01,359
[SPEAKER_15]: So between our last meeting and this meeting, I went in and I met with city solicitor Mark Rumley,

318
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:13,068
[SPEAKER_15]: to get some help with him on the wording of what the possible consequences could be for a school committee member who was in violation of one of the policies.

319
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:25,797
[SPEAKER_15]: So we reviewed the draft together and I came up with the new number five, which I put a copy in front of each of your tables this evening due to the last minute meeting that we had.

320
00:54:26,379 --> 00:54:32,824
[SPEAKER_15]: We also had another meeting this evening from 6 to 618 p.m.

321
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:50,860
[SPEAKER_15]: so that we could vote on the new final draft, including the updates to number five, and also including some different wording because we want to make sure that we weren't in violation with the law or the First Amendment.

322
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,923
[SPEAKER_15]: So what you have in front of you right now is what was

323
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:03,903
[SPEAKER_15]: looked at by City Solicitor Mark Rumley, and he said that the way it reads right now, we are in violation with the law in the First Amendment.

324
00:55:05,104 --> 00:55:23,651
[SPEAKER_15]: So if everybody was in agreement with it, what we could do is we could, you know, ask maybe if we could put it on school letterhead, and then we could sign it at one of the future meetings, if there's something that you want to see in it differently, or if you have an idea that you wanted to see in it,

325
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:25,733
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we'd be happy to hear from you.

326
00:55:30,116 --> 00:55:33,918
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to send this to Committee of the Whole, or do you want to send it to the floor?

327
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:42,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, if we talked about it this evening, and we feel like it's ready to go to the floor,

328
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:51,898
[SPEAKER_15]: if everybody's okay with the way, it's supposed to be the key functions of the school committee, not the policies.

329
00:55:52,258 --> 00:55:56,080
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not a listing of everything that we do on school committee.

330
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:03,163
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the key components.

331
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:11,746
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not sure if you want to have a committee of the whole, that is something that we could do and we could talk about it

332
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,592
[SPEAKER_15]: some time in January or February.

333
00:56:14,612 --> 00:56:21,177
[SPEAKER_15]: If, you know, if this evening, if everybody's reviewed it over the last couple, I think you've got to draft another time.

334
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:29,183
[SPEAKER_15]: We did take out some language that wasn't legal or was in, it was in violation with the First Amendment.

335
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:40,632
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why, you know, if we were going to add anything else, we'd want to have either cities or both city solicitor Mark Marmoley and Howard Greenspan review it just to make sure we are, you know,

336
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:45,040
[SPEAKER_15]: legally incompliant before we put anything on our website and sign it.

337
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

338
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:47,781
[SPEAKER_06]: DiBenedetto.

339
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:52,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to say I don't love number five.

340
00:56:52,883 --> 00:57:00,566
[SPEAKER_06]: If a school committee member acts in a fashion that is unbecoming, may be subject to censure by two-thirds of the vote of the body.

341
00:57:00,847 --> 00:57:02,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what items are unbecoming?

342
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:03,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Who decides that?

343
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:06,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that just can be anything.

344
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:08,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And censure.

345
00:57:09,623 --> 00:57:11,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't report to my fellow members.

346
00:57:11,864 --> 00:57:17,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I report to the people who voted for me to be their voice at this seat.

347
00:57:18,106 --> 00:57:25,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would pull off item five totally.

348
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:30,630
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wouldn't sign off on this document with that on there.

349
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:35,311
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think people would have a hard time censoring me anyway.

350
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:36,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Good luck.

351
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,762
[SPEAKER_06]: because that's my job as a committee member is to speak my mind for the people who are elected me.

352
00:57:46,183 --> 00:58:02,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And if other people get a right to censor what I say or find that what I say is unbecoming because they don't like it for any way, shape, or form, or my attitude, or the way that I might present it, or how passionate I am about an issue, I think is very dangerous to put in here.

353
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:07,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it would be so impossible to regulate

354
00:58:08,204 --> 00:58:10,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I think you know me for eight years.

355
00:58:11,107 --> 00:58:12,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hot enough to regulate.

356
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:16,413
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just not going to work.

357
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:17,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Ruggiero.

358
00:58:19,276 --> 00:58:23,240
[SPEAKER_14]: We spent a lot of time thinking about the idea of consequences and what the consequences are.

359
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,002
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is something we debated back and forth.

360
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:30,215
[SPEAKER_14]: According to Robert's Rules of Order, we have the authority now, whether we sign the document or not.

361
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:36,477
[SPEAKER_14]: And what is activity on becoming a member is actually a subjective element.

362
00:58:37,878 --> 00:58:47,501
[SPEAKER_14]: The idea, though, is censure has, you are ultimately responsible to the members of Medford, and the citizens of Medford.

363
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:54,584
[SPEAKER_14]: So what you say is not, while we can censor you, it's what your authority is to the people of Medford.

364
00:58:55,207 --> 00:59:01,429
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, the idea, we wanted to add some element that we debated this idea back and forth quite a bit.

365
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:12,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimately, we came down on the idea that there should be some sort of provision for a member that we felt acts in violation with the things that we're signing.

366
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:14,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, it's just a piece of paper.

367
00:59:14,854 --> 00:59:21,056
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think in the sessions that we had over the last several months with our association of school committees, they spoke about

368
00:59:21,805 --> 00:59:26,287
[SPEAKER_07]: setting up guidelines for behavior, not behavior, but in what our role really is.

369
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:32,008
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are we trying to deliver to the school students of our community?

370
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:38,971
[SPEAKER_07]: And I didn't see it more as how we were acting, but if we were going astray to bring us back into what our role is.

371
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:43,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So censure to me is a very harsh word, but I do recall her saying that.

372
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:49,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess I'd be interested in seeing some examples from other communities that she had given to you all.

373
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:52,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

374
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:52,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent.

375
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

376
00:59:54,797 --> 01:00:00,982
[SPEAKER_11]: And these five rules were based upon the samples that other districts are currently using.

377
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:06,226
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was kind of like a potpourri, but the language that was removed.

378
01:00:08,728 --> 01:00:14,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Mark Rumley said, you know, the pieces that needed to be removed were removed.

379
01:00:14,353 --> 01:00:17,856
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, there's always a possibility of doing a committee of the whole.

380
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:21,279
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can also revisit this in another retreat

381
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:29,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Dorothy Presser, also talking about norms and rules of engagement, going deeper with that.

382
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:36,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I make a recommendation that someone send it to Committee of the Whole so that we can deliberate it and there's other things that have to get done this night?

383
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:42,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, motion to send to Committee of the Whole, offered by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

384
01:00:42,532 --> 01:00:42,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Kreatz.

385
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:44,253
[SPEAKER_16]: Before I call the roll, Ms.

386
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:44,713
[SPEAKER_16]: Van der Kloot.

387
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:50,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, before you call the roll, there's just one other sentence that I wish the committee to look at, because I kept on reading it and kept on reading it.

388
01:00:50,676 --> 01:00:52,656
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's going to be in Committee of the Whole now, so we can all look at it collectively.

389
01:00:52,676 --> 01:00:54,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's going to go to Committee of the Whole?

390
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:54,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

391
01:00:54,377 --> 01:00:54,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

392
01:00:55,058 --> 01:00:56,358
[SPEAKER_07]: If it gets voted on to go there.

393
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:58,079
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second.

394
01:00:58,099 --> 01:00:58,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

395
01:00:59,634 --> 01:01:00,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote, please.

396
01:01:00,514 --> 01:01:01,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Send this paper to Committee of the Whole.

397
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:03,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. DeVantage, yes.

398
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:05,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Graves, yes.

399
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:05,796
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Stone, no.

400
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Regano, yes.

401
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Chew, yes.

402
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:10,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Mrs. Vanderbilt, yes.

403
01:01:10,657 --> 01:01:12,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Vanderbilt, yes.

404
01:01:12,938 --> 01:01:14,499
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe Mrs. Stone was a yes or no.

405
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:15,199
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was a yes.

406
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,059
[SPEAKER_07]: You were a yes.

407
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:17,540
[SPEAKER_07]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

408
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

409
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:22,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Community Relations Subcommittee, December 11, 2018.

410
01:01:22,476 --> 01:01:23,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Jarrell.

411
01:01:32,635 --> 01:01:37,357
[SPEAKER_14]: safety involvement and volunteering, but that's something we're still doing some more research on.

412
01:01:37,397 --> 01:01:44,901
[SPEAKER_14]: There are three papers that we would like to have considered in the entire meeting, so I'll just go through the first of them right now.

413
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:50,644
[SPEAKER_14]: The first item that was referred to us many months ago was about digital documents being posted online.

414
01:01:52,145 --> 01:02:00,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, many parents have asked me to post items personally, but we as a committee felt it would be best if we had a unified policy.

415
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:06,191
[SPEAKER_14]: So, originally we wanted to do a number of research, which we did.

416
01:02:06,692 --> 01:02:08,853
[SPEAKER_14]: First, we spoke with Dorothy Presser.

417
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:12,534
[SPEAKER_14]: She's our representative for the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

418
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:16,096
[SPEAKER_14]: She has no official position.

419
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:20,358
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no official guidance on digital documents being posted online.

420
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,741
[SPEAKER_14]: However, she hasn't heard any negative feedback from the communities that do it.

421
01:02:26,561 --> 01:02:35,231
[SPEAKER_14]: They also don't track it, but she said probably a sizable minority, maybe 40%, maybe 30% of communities do post online.

422
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:45,782
[SPEAKER_14]: So after that, I called a number of different school committees and mostly superintendent's offices to see their position and see

423
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:50,623
[SPEAKER_14]: what effect it had in their community posting these documents online.

424
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:55,224
[SPEAKER_14]: There were basically four major areas that I asked them.

425
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,705
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I asked them to describe their posting process.

426
01:02:58,825 --> 01:03:01,805
[SPEAKER_14]: All of the communities I had a chance to talk to had different processes.

427
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:05,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Second, I asked, did it help or hurt the community?

428
01:03:06,226 --> 01:03:08,627
[SPEAKER_14]: And what problems have you had in the implementation?

429
01:03:09,127 --> 01:03:12,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Thirdly, I asked, what system did you use to post?

430
01:03:12,407 --> 01:03:15,528
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, I asked, did they have any unforeseen problems that arose?

431
01:03:17,688 --> 01:03:23,290
[SPEAKER_14]: In short, all the communities I spoke to felt very positively about posting documents online.

432
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:33,132
[SPEAKER_14]: None reported any significant problems from people using documents in a way that was not becoming or productive.

433
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:37,313
[SPEAKER_14]: First, I spoke with some people at Melrose.

434
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:39,293
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke to Diane Hogan.

435
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,194
[SPEAKER_14]: She's the assistant to the superintendent there.

436
01:03:41,874 --> 01:03:46,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Overall, she believed that they had a positive experience of posting packets online.

437
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:55,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Their community posted packets 72 hours in advance, and they use a program called Grayness, which is used by the entire community.

438
01:03:58,939 --> 01:03:59,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Diane, or Ms.

439
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:01,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Hogan, believed it helped the community in real time.

440
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:03,529
[SPEAKER_14]: And they've been doing it since 2012.

441
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:10,655
[SPEAKER_14]: They also felt that there's a tendency for rumors to sort of spread through a community.

442
01:04:10,695 --> 01:04:15,079
[SPEAKER_14]: But with the digital documents there, she felt that those kind of rumors were stymied.

443
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:20,144
[SPEAKER_14]: I left a message with the people at Danvers, but they weren't able to get back to me.

444
01:04:20,164 --> 01:04:24,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also called a couple of other districts and weren't able to get back to me.

445
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:31,773
[SPEAKER_14]: But the people at Redding, whose name, the last name of this lady I unfortunately forgot to write down, her name was Linda.

446
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:34,235
[SPEAKER_14]: She was also an executive assistant.

447
01:04:34,596 --> 01:04:36,778
[SPEAKER_14]: She believed that they had a very positive experience.

448
01:04:37,298 --> 01:04:39,961
[SPEAKER_14]: They posted 48 hours in advance of meetings.

449
01:04:41,282 --> 01:04:42,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And they used PDFs.

450
01:04:42,743 --> 01:04:45,686
[SPEAKER_14]: So they don't, they do not pay for any expensive system.

451
01:04:45,726 --> 01:04:47,327
[SPEAKER_14]: They just post PDFs online.

452
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:51,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Franklin Public Schools, I spoke to Denise Miller.

453
01:04:52,337 --> 01:04:54,680
[SPEAKER_14]: They've had also a very positive experience with posting.

454
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:59,567
[SPEAKER_14]: They felt like there were no problems with doing anything online.

455
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:04,173
[SPEAKER_14]: What they did was a system, actually I'm going to recommend that we do, they send a link

456
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:06,395
[SPEAKER_14]: to school committee members first.

457
01:05:07,056 --> 01:05:14,403
[SPEAKER_14]: School committee members have a few hours to review the materials in advance, and then the link is sent to the community at large.

458
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:21,109
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't send presentations or superintendent notes beforehand, and they also use just PDFs.

459
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:24,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, I spoke to the people at Lexington.

460
01:05:25,072 --> 01:05:25,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

461
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:27,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Calvino is the executive assistant there.

462
01:05:27,974 --> 01:05:32,236
[SPEAKER_14]: She was the most enthusiastic about posting documents online in advance.

463
01:05:32,676 --> 01:05:41,402
[SPEAKER_14]: She felt that it was very helpful to members of the community, and she would have actually parents call her back if they were spelling errors or typos online, so that was something that they had.

464
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:50,907
[SPEAKER_14]: She believes lots of parents use the documents and look forward to the packets to make sure that when they come to school committee meetings, they're prepared in advance.

465
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:59,671
[SPEAKER_14]: She did have or their community had a little problem with posting PDFs on a timetable that the community understood.

466
01:06:00,132 --> 01:06:07,215
[SPEAKER_14]: So they just recommend that maybe we have a trial period first to make sure that all the wrinkles are ironed out and yeah.

467
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,916
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no confusion about when things are posted.

468
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:20,322
[SPEAKER_14]: So our committee unanimously voted to do a similar program as they do in Franklin.

469
01:06:20,782 --> 01:06:31,930
[SPEAKER_14]: We would like there to be a link sent to all school committee members at 12 noon to all school committee members, and then a link sent to the community at large at 4 p.m.

470
01:06:32,898 --> 01:06:39,883
[SPEAKER_14]: These links would be in our entire packets, but what is confidential or materials that need to be presented and put in context?

471
01:06:40,383 --> 01:06:41,464
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I interrupt you for a second?

472
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:41,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

473
01:06:41,704 --> 01:06:42,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that in your committee report?

474
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:44,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I don't see that.

475
01:06:44,106 --> 01:06:45,787
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we haven't voted on the minutes yet.

476
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:47,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to go back to committee?

477
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:48,469
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no.

478
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:51,851
[SPEAKER_14]: We voted to send it to school committee.

479
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:52,371
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't sure.

480
01:06:52,391 --> 01:06:53,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we send?

481
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,364
[SPEAKER_07]: But we didn't vote on those minutes.

482
01:06:58,384 --> 01:07:01,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So we didn't get that committee report yet.

483
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:03,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we haven't voted on those minutes.

484
01:07:03,952 --> 01:07:08,880
[SPEAKER_14]: But I believe at this point we've done a good amount of research on this issue and we can move this forward.

485
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:10,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

486
01:07:10,957 --> 01:07:11,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Van der Kloot.

487
01:07:11,998 --> 01:07:13,278
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have that in front of us.

488
01:07:13,338 --> 01:07:17,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Michael, I didn't realize that you didn't have the written minutes for this meeting.

489
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:20,522
[SPEAKER_14]: So you need the minutes for this meeting.

490
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:21,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

491
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:23,644
[SPEAKER_16]: So you are reporting on things.

492
01:07:24,104 --> 01:07:30,908
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing is that there is one item that, because of a time constraint, needs to be reported out from the subcommittee right now.

493
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:39,372
[SPEAKER_16]: So in some ways, the other stuff you're providing for us on this topic, we don't have a report on.

494
01:07:41,494 --> 01:07:45,602
[SPEAKER_16]: The piece that we need to report out because of a time constraint, if I

495
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:49,172
[SPEAKER_16]: if I can proceed, or do you want to go with it?

496
01:07:49,292 --> 01:07:52,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I, oh, we can go ahead.

497
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,154
[SPEAKER_16]: You can speak to that.

498
01:07:53,234 --> 01:08:08,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so there's the piece that we need to proceed on is that the subcommittee suggested, Michael's been talking about other ways to make us accessible to the community, and the subcommittee had a long discussion about this.

499
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:15,488
[SPEAKER_16]: And one suggestion was providing, rather than a formal meeting, an opportunity for the community to have a

500
01:08:16,068 --> 01:08:21,456
[SPEAKER_16]: meet-and-greet for school committee members for the community.

501
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:33,111
[SPEAKER_16]: And to that end, we were thinking about what events already brought the community out, and there's one coming up in February.

502
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:37,472
[SPEAKER_16]: which is the Medford Family Network Valentine's Social.

503
01:08:38,472 --> 01:08:56,517
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we discussed the possibility of having a meet-and-greet hour before the Valentine's Social, so that at the Valentine's Social, we customarily go and we scoop ice cream, and it's really nice to see people, but it's not an opportunity to get into much conversation.

504
01:08:58,078 --> 01:09:18,674
[SPEAKER_16]: I did speak to Marie Cassidy about this, and she understood, and she said that if we were to proceed on this, she could put a line in her flyer to say prior, you know, from 2 to 3, come meet the school committee, or whatever, from 11 to 12.

505
01:09:19,815 --> 01:09:24,119
[SPEAKER_16]: But because she's getting that information out to the public, we should

506
01:09:25,235 --> 01:09:27,319
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the piece that's critical for tonight.

507
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:33,351
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there a motion to have the school committee hold a meet and greet the day of the social?

508
01:09:34,179 --> 01:09:34,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

509
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:36,200
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the recommendation of the committee?

510
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:36,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, absolutely.

511
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

512
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,840
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just, I'm a little confused on the logistics of this matter.

513
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:46,302
[SPEAKER_14]: So the minutes of the meeting haven't been posted because we haven't voted on our last meeting yet.

514
01:09:46,322 --> 01:09:47,982
[SPEAKER_07]: You vote at the end of your meeting.

515
01:09:49,243 --> 01:09:55,504
[SPEAKER_14]: We did vote at the end of our meeting to send these, to send the digital documents meeting forward to the whole committee.

516
01:09:55,764 --> 01:09:55,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

517
01:09:56,184 --> 01:09:58,125
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's two items I would like to be reviewed.

518
01:09:59,114 --> 01:10:06,916
[SPEAKER_14]: that we vote for the meet and greet, and two, also, that we start posting digital documents online, which we've cleared with the administration.

519
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,177
[SPEAKER_14]: That shouldn't be a problem to do.

520
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,898
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have a report.

521
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:24,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto, does two items on up, I second having the meet and greet on February, would have a day that, is it actually Valentine's Day?

522
01:10:24,881 --> 01:10:26,502
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't remember what date it is.

523
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:27,722
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's the second Saturday.

524
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:40,266
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so at the Valentine's Day social that the Method Family Network provides, I second the motion on the floor for us to have that.

525
01:10:40,286 --> 01:10:41,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move that motion.

526
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:42,628
[SPEAKER_07]: That's separate from the committee report.

527
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:43,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

528
01:10:44,189 --> 01:10:45,530
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion offered by Ms.

529
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

530
01:10:48,152 --> 01:10:52,375
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor to host a meet and greet an hour before the Valentine social.

531
01:10:52,956 --> 01:10:53,616
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

532
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:54,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

533
01:10:54,537 --> 01:10:55,177
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

534
01:10:55,678 --> 01:10:56,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

535
01:10:56,398 --> 01:10:56,759
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

536
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:02,768
[SPEAKER_16]: confused because he thought he was bringing the report to it.

537
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:12,390
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to explain that when you talked to me about it, I thought that the report that was on my desk was the report of this past meeting that we had on December 11th.

538
01:11:17,712 --> 01:11:21,793
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't have this in our packet on Friday either, this one, the November meeting.

539
01:11:22,193 --> 01:11:27,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so that can hold over until you can bring it to the floor at the next meeting.

540
01:11:28,177 --> 01:11:33,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and the motion that the November 2018 report be accepted and placed on file by Ms.

541
01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:36,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

542
01:11:36,619 --> 01:11:38,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I was gonna call it Ruggiero.

543
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:39,900
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

544
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

545
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,160
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

546
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:41,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

547
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

548
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:45,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Community participation.

549
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:49,242
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we have members of the Citywide PTO in attendance this evening.

550
01:11:49,622 --> 01:11:52,643
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been hard at work over the last several months.

551
01:11:54,223 --> 01:11:56,784
[SPEAKER_07]: If you'd like to go into detail on your efforts, please.

552
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi everyone, thank you so much for having us here.

553
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:08,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Christy Avino, this is Jenny Graham, and we are so excited to officially conclude our Disney Vacation Raffle.

554
01:12:09,297 --> 01:12:14,002
[SPEAKER_10]: When we came together this summer as a group of a dozen, between 12 and 20 parents,

555
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,292
[SPEAKER_10]: and volunteers from the four elementary schools.

556
01:12:17,372 --> 01:12:20,194
[SPEAKER_10]: We decided that we wanted to do just a few things to get started.

557
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:29,080
[SPEAKER_10]: There were some things that we thought were too big, and then we decided to do this Disney raffle, and I think you'll find that this has set the bar really high for sure, so we're really thrilled.

558
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:36,505
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we announce the winner, we want to say thank you to a few people who were really, really critical in our effort.

559
01:12:36,525 --> 01:12:43,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, also to Allie Fisk and Deanna Devaney in the mayor's office.

560
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:49,991
[SPEAKER_10]: Kevin Bailey and Danny Folks from the Recreation Department were very supportive, as was our City Clerk, Adam Herdeweis.

561
01:12:51,012 --> 01:13:04,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Our elementary school principals were really critical in supporting our efforts, so thank you to Principal Johnson, Principal Guarino, Principal Kaye, and Principal Galusi, as well as their staff and all of the teachers who helped support us.

562
01:13:05,075 --> 01:13:09,996
[SPEAKER_10]: We also want to thank the PTO boards at the schools, and most importantly, I think,

563
01:13:10,355 --> 01:13:14,879
[SPEAKER_10]: All of the parents and kids who sold tickets and spread the word about our raffle.

564
01:13:14,899 --> 01:13:20,604
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of our parents sold hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of tickets in support of this effort.

565
01:13:20,624 --> 01:13:21,745
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were really thrilled.

566
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:25,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Some enterprising elementary students spent hours.

567
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:27,830
[SPEAKER_10]: I promised my son I would give him a shout out.

568
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:32,874
[SPEAKER_10]: He spent about 12 hours over six or seven events wearing his little Mickey ears.

569
01:13:33,635 --> 01:13:36,057
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we can say safely he has a great career.

570
01:13:36,393 --> 01:13:37,935
[SPEAKER_10]: in either sales or politics.

571
01:13:37,975 --> 01:13:39,617
[SPEAKER_10]: He knows about half of Medford now.

572
01:13:40,758 --> 01:13:42,340
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you all to those people.

573
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:47,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Our community was really, really gracious and supportive of us as well.

574
01:13:47,686 --> 01:13:50,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Many welcomed us into their space and their events.

575
01:13:50,369 --> 01:13:51,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to thank St.

576
01:13:51,971 --> 01:13:55,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Francis of Assisi Church, the Friends of Medford Public Library,

577
01:13:55,772 --> 01:14:05,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Atlas Liquors on Mystic Ave, Bertucci's on Mystic Valley Parkway, Metro Rock Gym in Everett, 4 Good Vibes on Main Street, Friends of the Fells, Salem Street Studio.

578
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:07,795
[SPEAKER_10]: This was a really great effort from our community.

579
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:11,876
[SPEAKER_10]: We also want to thank Wegmans for a very generous supporting donation.

580
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:17,757
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you also to the Irish American Club because they lent us this fabulous little raffle wheel.

581
01:14:20,017 --> 01:14:22,078
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to turn it over to Jenny to tell you a little bit more.

582
01:14:22,098 --> 01:14:22,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Kristen.

583
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:32,939
[SPEAKER_17]: So there are a number of people who definitely won't win anything tonight, namely our raffle captains.

584
01:14:33,019 --> 01:14:45,105
[SPEAKER_17]: So there were 10 folks who were identified as captains at the outset of this effort who were expressly prohibited from buying tickets, although they were asked to spend lots and lots and lots of hours helping other people be eligible to win.

585
01:14:46,243 --> 01:14:57,213
[SPEAKER_17]: Our raffle captains included Christy Aveno, Jen Conti, myself, Melissa Maywalt, Maureen McSweeney, Doug Nagengast, Gary Pabst, Cheryl Rodriguez, Bob Russo, and Bailey Schendel.

586
01:14:58,033 --> 01:15:11,325
[SPEAKER_17]: A special thank you to Tamara Morrow, who is the treasurer of the Brooks, and she is a raffle captain and the person who is responsible for the finances, the reporting, and raffle compliance, which is no small feat.

587
01:15:12,005 --> 01:15:13,827
[SPEAKER_17]: We've learned a lot about raffles.

588
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:19,116
[SPEAKER_17]: But she has done an immensely huge task with ease.

589
01:15:20,357 --> 01:15:26,519
[SPEAKER_17]: So we sold 4,824 tickets and received some donations along the way.

590
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:28,440
[SPEAKER_17]: Our gross sales were $24,178.

591
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:28,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Yay.

592
01:15:38,482 --> 01:15:50,636
[SPEAKER_17]: After we pay our raffle expenses, and we filed our required tax returns, and we pay our gaming taxes, our schools will each receive over $4,000, which is a huge addition to all of the PTOs.

593
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:53,539
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's $4,000 to each elementary school, give or take.

594
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:55,761
[SPEAKER_17]: the end of the bath.

595
01:15:57,282 --> 01:15:58,123
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just getting started.

596
01:15:58,163 --> 01:15:59,825
[SPEAKER_17]: We have two more events planned this spring.

597
01:16:00,366 --> 01:16:05,591
[SPEAKER_17]: Our electronics recycling will return, and we'll have a Wizards game in the spring as well.

598
01:16:05,631 --> 01:16:06,952
[SPEAKER_17]: And there will be more to come on both.

599
01:16:08,013 --> 01:16:10,516
[SPEAKER_17]: But the reason that we're here is to pull the winner.

600
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:12,278
[SPEAKER_17]: So the raffle wheel is there.

601
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:13,929
[SPEAKER_17]: It's quite full.

602
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:21,853
[SPEAKER_17]: We did mix everything around and shake it up and the wheel can be spun a few more times for good measure.

603
01:16:22,653 --> 01:16:26,715
[SPEAKER_17]: The first prize that we would like Dr. Edouard-Vincent to pull is the grand prize winner.

604
01:16:27,555 --> 01:16:33,038
[SPEAKER_17]: The grand prize of the raffle is $5,000 in Disney gift cards or a cash equivalent.

605
01:16:34,019 --> 01:16:38,983
[SPEAKER_17]: The grand prize winner can, at their option, use the gift cards to book a vacation at a Disney resort or Disney cruise.

606
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:49,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Shannon Demos, the assistant principal at the Brooks School, is a local resident Disney expert and has volunteered her time to help the winner plan their vacation, if they so choose.

607
01:16:51,194 --> 01:16:58,340
[SPEAKER_17]: The $5,000 grand prize may or may not cover the whole cost of a vacation, including airfare, accommodation, and dining, subject to the winner's booking preferences.

608
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,521
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go to Disney all kinds of different ways.

609
01:17:02,082 --> 01:17:05,883
[SPEAKER_17]: So $5,000 is kind of a blank canvas for whoever that winner is.

610
01:17:07,204 --> 01:17:11,546
[SPEAKER_17]: The winner must be 18 years of age or older and a US citizen or lawful permanent resident.

611
01:17:12,446 --> 01:17:17,649
[SPEAKER_17]: The winner must claim their prize in seven business days, so excluding Christmas, which is a federally recognized holiday.

612
01:17:17,689 --> 01:17:22,311
[SPEAKER_17]: This means the prize must be claimed by December 27th at 5 or we will draw a new winner.

613
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,112
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you would do the honors and pull the winner.

614
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:28,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Spin that drum.

615
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Reach in there really good.

616
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,873
[SPEAKER_17]: Whoa, that is hot.

617
01:17:33,694 --> 01:17:34,995
[SPEAKER_17]: It is quite full.

618
01:17:35,135 --> 01:17:37,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the winner is Lynn Freitas, 26 Stearns Avenue, Medford.

619
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:40,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo, all right.

620
01:17:55,685 --> 01:17:58,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anyone know Lynn?

621
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:02,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anybody know Lynn?

622
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,092
[SPEAKER_17]: We will take that and call her.

623
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:09,576
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if you would also pull one more ticket, there is a second place prize.

624
01:18:09,716 --> 01:18:12,559
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a $250 Disney gift card.

625
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,023
[SPEAKER_17]: The same rules apply about claiming the prize and US residents and all of that good stuff.

626
01:18:18,123 --> 01:18:19,884
[SPEAKER_17]: But the second prize winner will be pulled now.

627
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:22,426
[SPEAKER_17]: It is packed.

628
01:18:22,747 --> 01:18:23,928
[SPEAKER_07]: We needed a bigger drum.

629
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:29,352
[SPEAKER_17]: So next year we'll also be on the hunt for a slightly bigger drum.

630
01:18:30,092 --> 01:18:32,794
[SPEAKER_07]: We can get you one of the recycling bins.

631
01:18:33,154 --> 01:18:35,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Composting.

632
01:18:36,497 --> 01:18:38,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, the winner is Mara Kennedy.

633
01:18:39,499 --> 01:18:40,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Mara Kennedy.

634
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,962
[SPEAKER_11]: 49 Salton Stall Road, Medford.

635
01:18:50,862 --> 01:18:51,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job.

636
01:18:52,122 --> 01:18:55,943
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you very much for playing along here and pulling our winners.

637
01:18:56,023 --> 01:19:01,424
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll take those from you, and we will take the wheel and empty it out and get it back to the Irish-American as well.

638
01:19:01,524 --> 01:19:04,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you all worked very, very hard.

639
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:08,306
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you at so many events, including election day, pre-election day.

640
01:19:08,646 --> 01:19:09,686
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys were everywhere.

641
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:14,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So kudos to all of you for what you've done in investing in your schools and our schools.

642
01:19:14,787 --> 01:19:15,448
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

643
01:19:15,468 --> 01:19:16,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

644
01:19:31,255 --> 01:19:32,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

645
01:19:34,496 --> 01:19:35,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Benedetto.

646
01:19:35,516 --> 01:19:35,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

647
01:19:38,536 --> 01:19:50,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Under community participation, I got a note from the daughter of Lena DeGentema, so regarding the event we had, those of you who don't know,

648
01:19:50,715 --> 01:19:54,137
[SPEAKER_06]: We named the music room the Gigentmaso Music Room.

649
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:56,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the superintendent had it in her comments.

650
01:19:56,978 --> 01:19:58,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good.

651
01:19:58,659 --> 01:20:03,522
[SPEAKER_06]: So from her daughter, she just wrote, Erin, thank you again for the wonderful evening last night.

652
01:20:04,002 --> 01:20:10,786
[SPEAKER_06]: The ceremony that the district provided was truly humbling.

653
01:20:11,626 --> 01:20:15,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And my mom loved this dedication more than words could tell.

654
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for a wonderful, memorable night.

655
01:20:19,322 --> 01:20:24,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And please tell Lisa Evangelista we realize how much time and effort she put into the event.

656
01:20:25,507 --> 01:20:25,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

657
01:20:26,387 --> 01:20:26,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

658
01:20:26,808 --> 01:20:27,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

659
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:27,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Pass that on.

660
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:33,233
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for items, did you like to speak on this?

661
01:20:33,593 --> 01:20:34,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

662
01:20:34,133 --> 01:20:34,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hi.

663
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:34,974
[SPEAKER_02]: That's OK.

664
01:20:35,655 --> 01:20:38,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry it was a little slow coming up for the participation.

665
01:20:38,897 --> 01:20:39,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone.

666
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:40,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Mayor Burke.

667
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:41,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Superintendent.

668
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, members of the committee.

669
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:46,383
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Carolyn Montello, 108 Ashcroft Road.

670
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:52,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And this evening, I wanted to bring up the issue of heat at the high school.

671
01:20:53,764 --> 01:21:03,673
[SPEAKER_02]: After a few recent very cold visits to the high school's Karen Theater and gym, I began to look into what might be the issue with the heat at the high school.

672
01:21:04,453 --> 01:21:07,376
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told that the heat in the theater is broken.

673
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,938
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like a part has been ordered.

674
01:21:10,626 --> 01:21:12,087
[SPEAKER_02]: and should be installed soon.

675
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:17,008
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was also informed that the gym only has one unit left working.

676
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:19,429
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the unit in cage three.

677
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:23,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And the others are basically gone and have been that way for years.

678
01:21:25,491 --> 01:21:32,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I also heard from parents recently that the school, that the pool area seems to be having heating issues as well.

679
01:21:33,654 --> 01:21:40,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And for years, I've heard from students as well as teachers that some of the classrooms are so cold in the winter

680
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:43,411
[SPEAKER_02]: that students need to wear their coats inside.

681
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:52,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And a student this year told me that in one classroom, students are allowed to bring in blankets because it's so cold.

682
01:21:53,315 --> 01:22:00,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think most parents assume that their school is heated when they send their kids off to school in the winter.

683
01:22:00,617 --> 01:22:03,478
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think that people even think to ask the question.

684
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:10,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to ask a member of the committee to make a motion to immediately

685
01:22:11,141 --> 01:22:21,404
[SPEAKER_02]: audit the current heating system throughout the high school, and provide an update at the next school committee meeting, and make any repairs if and as needed.

686
01:22:21,724 --> 01:22:23,365
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved by member Van der Kloot.

687
01:22:24,225 --> 01:22:29,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, just regarding the theater, a coil is on order, and it will be installed over the holidays.

688
01:22:30,386 --> 01:22:31,226
[SPEAKER_07]: the holiday break.

689
01:22:31,386 --> 01:22:33,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the worst case it will be installed.

690
01:22:34,007 --> 01:22:36,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And two out of the four heaters are working in the gym.

691
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:38,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it say enough heat?

692
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,050
[SPEAKER_11]: It's sufficient heat in the gym area?

693
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:44,390
[SPEAKER_07]: It's two out of four.

694
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Two out of four.

695
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:53,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to hear a little later from the superintendent on an item that we applied for MSBA school funding.

696
01:22:54,273 --> 01:22:58,934
[SPEAKER_07]: She's going to be making not a great announcement, unfortunately.

697
01:22:59,713 --> 01:23:01,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Van der Kloot, just move your motion.

698
01:23:01,594 --> 01:23:02,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second to the item?

699
01:23:03,435 --> 01:23:04,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

700
01:23:05,016 --> 01:23:06,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I miss you?

701
01:23:06,377 --> 01:23:06,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

702
01:23:07,517 --> 01:23:08,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

703
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:19,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And just with the heat in the gym, it's definitely, I don't know if they don't turn it on on the weekends, but I'm there for basketball games on the weekends and the gym is freezing.

704
01:23:20,244 --> 01:23:23,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has down coats on, people from other communities.

705
01:23:24,116 --> 01:23:26,037
[SPEAKER_02]: coming to the games, comment on it, so.

706
01:23:26,337 --> 01:23:28,478
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just there, like, what, a week ago?

707
01:23:28,738 --> 01:23:33,721
[SPEAKER_07]: We were both there, and we had coats off, and comfortable, but we'll have an audit done.

708
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:34,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would be great.

709
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:35,262
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll investigate it further.

710
01:23:35,282 --> 01:23:35,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

711
01:23:35,662 --> 01:23:36,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

712
01:23:36,022 --> 01:23:36,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

713
01:23:37,683 --> 01:23:38,323
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion.

714
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:39,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

715
01:23:39,024 --> 01:23:39,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Mantello.

716
01:23:40,144 --> 01:23:40,764
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion.

717
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:42,205
[SPEAKER_07]: All in favor?

718
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:42,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

719
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:43,746
[SPEAKER_07]: All opposed?

720
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:45,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion is granted.

721
01:23:46,948 --> 01:23:48,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Report of the superintendent.

722
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:49,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam?

723
01:23:57,434 --> 01:23:58,414
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening everyone.

724
01:23:59,494 --> 01:24:10,037
[SPEAKER_11]: So last Thursday, prior to the winter high school orchestra concert, we enjoyed a wonderful event celebrating former school committee member Lina DiGentimasso.

725
01:24:10,997 --> 01:24:14,898
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford High School Music Room was dedicated in her honor by Mayor Burke.

726
01:24:15,895 --> 01:24:18,897
[SPEAKER_11]: Lena and her family could not have been more appreciative.

727
01:24:19,497 --> 01:24:31,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I would be remiss if I did not thank our Fine Arts Director, Tony Zigny, for his gracious assistance, and the Medford High School Orchestra for their wonderful musical selections.

728
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:40,910
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like to recognize Principal Chad Fallon and the Culinary Arts Program for providing the pre-ceremony reception.

729
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:45,013
[SPEAKER_11]: It was truly a collaborative effort between the school committee

730
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:49,130
[SPEAKER_11]: the city council to honor Ms.

731
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:54,994
[SPEAKER_11]: DeGenta Maso, who devoted a great part of her life to the Medford Public Schools and our community.

732
01:24:55,614 --> 01:25:00,237
[SPEAKER_11]: The plaque is in place right now over the door of the music room in A building.

733
01:25:01,338 --> 01:25:03,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to just recognize that.

734
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,882
[SPEAKER_11]: I also wanted to talk a little bit about CCSR.

735
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:11,985
[SPEAKER_11]: Our CCSR students have been quite busy of late.

736
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:13,966
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford High School members have been visiting

737
01:25:15,845 --> 01:25:26,167
[SPEAKER_11]: with students in both, the high school students have been visiting with our students at the elementary and middle school levels to discuss CCSR goals and objectives.

738
01:25:27,107 --> 01:25:39,750
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were assisted, again, by Rhetta Smith and the Garden Club in planting the new orchard that we do now have in place, and we'll hear a little bit more about that in detail.

739
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And some of them are here with us.

740
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:44,651
[SPEAKER_11]: We had 10 pear trees.

741
01:25:45,631 --> 01:25:48,272
[SPEAKER_11]: planted, blackberries and raspberries were planted.

742
01:25:49,332 --> 01:25:50,192
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at this point in time.

743
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:52,153
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll come up a little later for a separate report.

744
01:25:53,313 --> 01:25:59,475
[SPEAKER_11]: And currently the CCSR are in the process of collecting toys for Tots.

745
01:25:59,895 --> 01:26:01,715
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to put that out there as well.

746
01:26:03,056 --> 01:26:10,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Our Spanish II honors class at the high school, they have Skyped with students in Bolivia.

747
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:23,082
[SPEAKER_11]: and our students were able to practice their conversational Spanish, while their students were able to practice conversational English, and our students truly enjoyed this learning experience.

748
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,823
[SPEAKER_11]: This unique learning experience, I should say.

749
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:36,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Hope Chest, so last week, the Medford High School Vocational School Hope Chest Food Pantry, Priscilla's Pantry, opened.

750
01:26:37,269 --> 01:26:41,090
[SPEAKER_11]: and the pantry is available for all students and is free of charge.

751
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:45,611
[SPEAKER_11]: The pantry has shelf-stable foods and household goods.

752
01:26:46,772 --> 01:26:55,314
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be open Thursdays after school from 2.30 to 3.30 with the hopes of expanding operating hours in the near future.

753
01:26:55,914 --> 01:27:00,576
[SPEAKER_11]: The pantry is located next to the third floor lecture hall in C building.

754
01:27:01,196 --> 01:27:04,957
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like to thank the following who made Priscilla's Pantry possible.

755
01:27:05,717 --> 01:27:22,861
[SPEAKER_11]: the Hoff Family Foundation, the Greater Boston Food Bank, in partnership with the Malden YMCA, along with the district's nutritionist, Retta Smith, and teachers Annie Saulnier, Emily Polini, and John Wilson.

756
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:28,362
[SPEAKER_11]: This is another great example of collaboration that benefits our students and families.

757
01:27:30,903 --> 01:27:32,386
[SPEAKER_11]: Empowering Girls Conference.

758
01:27:33,268 --> 01:27:40,002
[SPEAKER_11]: So on Wednesday, November 28th, a group of 8th grade students from the Andrews Middle School

759
01:27:40,831 --> 01:27:47,074
[SPEAKER_11]: attended the Empowering Girls 2018 conference at the Cary Memorial Building in Lexington.

760
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:57,920
[SPEAKER_11]: It was hosted by Middlesex DA, Marion Ryan, and the all-day program was designed for middle school girls with the theme of She Persisted.

761
01:27:58,801 --> 01:28:09,987
[SPEAKER_11]: The students and their chaperones, Katie Fumara, who's an adjustment Councilor, and Yvonne Santos, a guidance Councilor, were met with opening remarks from Marion Ryan.

762
01:28:10,847 --> 01:28:16,851
[SPEAKER_11]: who discussed the importance of persisting through difficulties and going after the career you want.

763
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:27,599
[SPEAKER_11]: The Andrews students listened to guest speakers, asked questions, participated in activities, and left feeling empowered and invigorated about their futures.

764
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:29,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to D.A.

765
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:39,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Ryan, the Empowering Girls 2018 program, it ended up being a huge success, and the Andrews will definitely return next year.

766
01:28:41,028 --> 01:28:48,695
[SPEAKER_11]: On the sports venue, Medford High School and our vocational school combined, our winter sports season has officially begun.

767
01:28:48,715 --> 01:28:56,702
[SPEAKER_11]: And our La Conte ice rink is offering expanded public skating over the holiday break.

768
01:28:56,862 --> 01:28:59,465
[SPEAKER_11]: And all of that is listed on our website and our blog.

769
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:04,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I continue to have a focus on looking at instruction.

770
01:29:05,727 --> 01:29:10,290
[SPEAKER_11]: I am really trying to stick to my goal of being in schools at least twice a week.

771
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:14,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am continuing to witness and observe instruction.

772
01:29:15,575 --> 01:29:20,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the past two weeks, I have been at the Columbus, the Roberts, the Brooks.

773
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:24,522
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really uplifting to see how devoted our teachers are.

774
01:29:25,662 --> 01:29:30,123
[SPEAKER_11]: in terms of implementing their curriculum and really being focused on our students.

775
01:29:31,903 --> 01:29:38,505
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, earlier today I was at the Columbus and I was able to spend time with one of our math coaches.

776
01:29:38,905 --> 01:29:46,926
[SPEAKER_11]: As you know, math is one of my goals and a serious focus of a lot of my instruction, although it's not exclusively mathematics.

777
01:29:47,547 --> 01:29:50,467
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was able to work with Ellie O'Leary today.

778
01:29:51,247 --> 01:29:54,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And I spent time with the fifth grade team at the Columbus School.

779
01:29:55,228 --> 01:30:16,419
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the opportunity to observe inclusion math and special education teacher Wendy Anderson was working collaboratively with the teacher, so it was wonderful to see inclusion at work and instruction happening and students focusing on math and having an opportunity to productively struggle.

780
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,866
[SPEAKER_11]: and be challenged, but know it's for a good reason, a good cause.

781
01:30:21,686 --> 01:30:27,690
[SPEAKER_11]: So as I've been looking at instruction, I've had the opportunity to look at instruction with principals.

782
01:30:28,191 --> 01:30:41,860
[SPEAKER_11]: When I was at the Brooks, I got to walk this last time with the assistant principal and members of my leadership team, and I also go to schools independently, so just continuing to keep my eyes on instruction.

783
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:49,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Another important thing happening in the district right now is ACE advisors and coaches in education.

784
01:30:50,675 --> 01:31:00,946
[SPEAKER_11]: This past week, Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Principals Nick Tucci of the McGlynn Middle School and Michael Downs, Principal of the Andrews Middle School,

785
01:31:01,603 --> 01:31:13,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Assistant Principal David Blouk at the high school, as well as Penny Funiali and Lisa Bandonian, met to discuss the ACE project at the middle schools.

786
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:22,615
[SPEAKER_11]: The ACE project, again, Advisors and Coaches in Education, is a project of the Medford Health Department, Team Medford, and Medford Public Schools.

787
01:31:23,555 --> 01:31:45,663
[SPEAKER_11]: The purpose of the ACE project is to educate and train club advisors and coaches on how to effectively build meaningful relationships with students through search institutes, evidence-based model for developmental relationships, which will help to reduce substance abuse and other risky behaviors in youth.

788
01:31:46,483 --> 01:31:51,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford High School already has ACE in place, so this is now moving down to the middle schools.

789
01:31:54,506 --> 01:31:55,208
[SPEAKER_11]: on safety.

790
01:31:55,870 --> 01:32:02,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Our principals and administrators have been actively working together on upgrading our building security plans.

791
01:32:03,348 --> 01:32:24,314
[SPEAKER_11]: All schools-based principals, Officer Ziobro and John McLaughlin, we met in a closed-door meeting session to discuss our current security practices and measures and examining the Safe Havens reports from a district perspective of what things we can do to continue to keep Medford safe.

792
01:32:24,995 --> 01:32:32,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Additionally, last week, Officer Ziobro, Lieutenant Paul Covino, Principal Nick Tucci and Principal Brian Toomey,

793
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:39,079
[SPEAKER_11]: They all attended safety workshops that were conducted by Safe Havens last week.

794
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:50,986
[SPEAKER_11]: And they reported out on the workshops, and they shared with the principal group when we were discussing our security and safety plans.

795
01:32:53,488 --> 01:32:57,010
[SPEAKER_11]: MSBA, which is the Massachusetts School Building Authority,

796
01:32:58,555 --> 01:33:04,885
[SPEAKER_11]: The MSBA did announce at the end of last week that they awarded their award recipients.

797
01:33:04,945 --> 01:33:06,487
[SPEAKER_11]: They awarded 14 districts.

798
01:33:07,168 --> 01:33:11,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Unfortunately, at this time Medford was not selected this year.

799
01:33:11,935 --> 01:33:14,079
[SPEAKER_11]: However, we will continue to apply.

800
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:17,306
[SPEAKER_11]: for funding to renovate our high school complex.

801
01:33:18,047 --> 01:33:26,311
[SPEAKER_11]: In light of not being selected, we will continue to work collaboratively with the city for targeted capital improvement projects.

802
01:33:26,391 --> 01:33:30,913
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's something that we're gonna continue to work on and work at.

803
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:41,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Another very important topic that has surfaced and the school committee members were requesting an update on vaping.

804
01:33:42,435 --> 01:33:51,158
[SPEAKER_11]: And vaping is definitely a serious concern that the country is facing and Medford is not excluded from this challenge.

805
01:33:53,543 --> 01:33:57,904
[SPEAKER_11]: We take this very seriously as a district and as a city.

806
01:33:59,145 --> 01:34:10,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Our school administration is very aware of the public health issues and how it's affecting our students and the community at large.

807
01:34:12,809 --> 01:34:21,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Here is, I'm going to share just a few brief overview of steps that we've taken thus far and that we're going to continue to address the issue of vaping as a district.

808
01:34:23,923 --> 01:34:26,144
[SPEAKER_11]: with a focus on the whole child.

809
01:34:26,944 --> 01:34:30,305
[SPEAKER_11]: We have engaged in specific student education around vaping.

810
01:34:31,245 --> 01:34:37,747
[SPEAKER_11]: They are addressing it in some portions of the curriculum that we're using, the Michigan model.

811
01:34:38,967 --> 01:34:44,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Student support to assist students who are at risk and engaging in risky behaviors.

812
01:34:45,009 --> 01:34:50,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Community partnerships in collaboration with the Medford Board of Health.

813
01:34:51,451 --> 01:34:55,713
[SPEAKER_11]: and frequent ongoing education and outreach for parents and staff.

814
01:34:56,174 --> 01:35:12,202
[SPEAKER_11]: We are also looking into providing in collaboration with the city, providing like a parent support group that could be available to parents at the high school and offer that.

815
01:35:12,242 --> 01:35:15,364
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are some of the things that we're trying to do.

816
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:17,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So knowing that vaping is

817
01:35:18,105 --> 01:35:19,687
[SPEAKER_11]: truly a serious concern.

818
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:34,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to just put it on the floor that it is something that we are taking very seriously, but because this is truly a large issue, we did not have enough time to prepare a comprehensive report.

819
01:35:34,873 --> 01:35:37,996
[SPEAKER_11]: on specific numbers and statistics of things that are happening.

820
01:35:38,056 --> 01:35:46,745
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're in the process of combining that to come back to you in January to give you a more robust presentation.

821
01:35:47,185 --> 01:35:51,510
[SPEAKER_11]: And we would like to, we are trying to ask Dr. Schuster

822
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:58,814
[SPEAKER_11]: and Team Medford from the Department of Public Health to come and share their wealth of knowledge with us.

823
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:02,136
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm shooting for the second meeting in January.

824
01:36:02,516 --> 01:36:12,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Schuster has already conducted professional development with members of Team Medford at the high school to all school leaders and

825
01:36:13,283 --> 01:36:28,069
[SPEAKER_11]: director-level administrators, and that was a very, very informative training, a lot of positive feedback, and they would like her to come back, and we would like her to also be able to come and present as an expert in the field.

826
01:36:29,009 --> 01:36:32,691
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is where we are with our work around vaping.

827
01:36:33,732 --> 01:36:38,634
[SPEAKER_11]: On another note, I wanted to just say today I had the pleasure of being at the Roberts School.

828
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:45,638
[SPEAKER_11]: I was invited to see their hand chimes concert.

829
01:36:47,178 --> 01:36:51,221
[SPEAKER_11]: And their music instructor, Mr. Jim Connors, is truly masterful.

830
01:36:51,821 --> 01:36:55,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Our arts department as a district is phenomenal.

831
01:36:55,844 --> 01:36:59,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And today was another special treat by fourth and fifth graders.

832
01:37:01,007 --> 01:37:02,848
[SPEAKER_11]: They played the hand chimes.

833
01:37:02,888 --> 01:37:09,372
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition to that, musical pieces, drums, xylophones, recorders.

834
01:37:09,673 --> 01:37:12,474
[SPEAKER_11]: And I saw for the first time today

835
01:37:13,655 --> 01:37:17,977
[SPEAKER_11]: tenor recorder and a bass recorder, I had not seen them.

836
01:37:18,037 --> 01:37:23,520
[SPEAKER_11]: So students were not only playing traditional recorders, but tenor and bass recorders.

837
01:37:24,021 --> 01:37:34,726
[SPEAKER_11]: So I could definitely see that under Mr. Connor's leadership that we definitely have additional, the band pipeline in the making.

838
01:37:35,927 --> 01:37:38,351
[SPEAKER_11]: hear the band music playing as I observed them.

839
01:37:38,932 --> 01:37:42,218
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was truly a positive experience.

840
01:37:42,658 --> 01:37:48,989
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to just thank the Roberts School, Principal Johnson, and the team that were there to

841
01:37:50,141 --> 01:37:52,222
[SPEAKER_11]: during the concert, it was really a great experience.

842
01:37:52,902 --> 01:38:03,147
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly, I would like to wish all of you, the school committee and the members of the community, a happy holiday season, a restful break.

843
01:38:04,807 --> 01:38:09,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Hanukkah has ended, but happy Hanukkah to all of those who did celebrate the holiday.

844
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:18,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to wish merry Christmas and happy Kwanzaa, and a healthy, happy, prosperous, peaceful new year to you all.

845
01:38:18,694 --> 01:38:21,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

846
01:38:22,435 --> 01:38:22,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

847
01:38:23,575 --> 01:38:23,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

848
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:24,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Van der Kloot.

849
01:38:25,156 --> 01:38:38,479
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to mention within all of the things that you mentioned, there also was an incredibly great middle school concert last Thursday night, which I had the pleasure and opportunity to attend.

850
01:38:39,059 --> 01:38:47,521
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you know, our middle school select ensemble has been gold medal winners many times over.

851
01:38:48,141 --> 01:38:53,742
[SPEAKER_16]: All of the levels, the 6th grade, the 7th and 8th, and the ensemble really did a terrific job.

852
01:38:54,442 --> 01:38:54,723
[SPEAKER_16]: And Ms.

853
01:38:54,763 --> 01:38:57,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Chang is just an amazing teacher.

854
01:38:57,943 --> 01:38:59,964
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to mention that tonight too.

855
01:39:00,164 --> 01:39:00,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

856
01:39:01,284 --> 01:39:01,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

857
01:39:03,785 --> 01:39:05,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent's updates and comments.

858
01:39:06,225 --> 01:39:07,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for all that information.

859
01:39:09,006 --> 01:39:12,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Report on planting of orchard at Medford High School.

860
01:39:13,627 --> 01:39:13,807
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

861
01:39:13,827 --> 01:39:14,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Caldwell.

862
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:16,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

863
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:25,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as you know, you voted this past year to bring an orchard to Medford High School to beautify our grounds even more than they are.

864
01:39:26,023 --> 01:39:34,386
[SPEAKER_04]: We did have some difficulty about where this was going to take place, but I think we've worked out a solution thanks to Retta Smith, who is our nutritionist.

865
01:39:34,826 --> 01:39:35,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you come up, please, Retta?

866
01:39:37,227 --> 01:39:40,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to introduce to you two very important people who have

867
01:39:41,263 --> 01:39:43,945
[SPEAKER_04]: who are from CCSR who spearheaded this as well.

868
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:50,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaylee Boulay and Prabhiti Rama would like to say a few words.

869
01:39:51,709 --> 01:39:51,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls?

870
01:39:55,811 --> 01:39:56,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon.

871
01:39:56,632 --> 01:40:06,417
[SPEAKER_09]: In the beginning of last year, we connected with Food Service Nutritionist Specialist Rhetta Smith about our interest in addressing food insecurity through our project

872
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:11,858
[SPEAKER_09]: with the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, also known as CCSR.

873
01:40:12,578 --> 01:40:19,041
[SPEAKER_09]: The original plan was to apply for all grants with the hopes of establishing a fruit orchard on the MHS campus.

874
01:40:19,601 --> 01:40:25,623
[SPEAKER_09]: Sean Driscoll Gomez joined the group shortly after and the plan then developed into a larger scope project.

875
01:40:26,283 --> 01:40:32,946
[SPEAKER_09]: With goals of beautification the exterior of the school through murals and creating an outdoor classroom in addition to planting the orchard

876
01:40:33,503 --> 01:40:43,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Sean has since graduated, but we have picked up additional CCSR students, Emily Gotti in the spring of 2018 and Jenna Matarazzo in the fall of 2018.

877
01:40:43,592 --> 01:40:53,520
[SPEAKER_09]: The project garnered much community support, but there were concerns among the school staff and its administration regarding the proposed location for the orchard.

878
01:40:54,257 --> 01:41:00,680
[SPEAKER_09]: After much discussion, it was decided the best location for the orchard would be in the interior courtyard of the high school.

879
01:41:01,341 --> 01:41:05,543
[SPEAKER_09]: My peer, Kaylee Boulay, will explain.

880
01:41:06,903 --> 01:41:17,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, so I'm Kaylee Boulay, and on Friday, December 7th, we had the opportunity to plant 10 Asian pear trees, 10 blackberry bushes, and 10 raspberry bushes.

881
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:22,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I, now a sophomore in Medford High, along with sophomores for B.D.

882
01:41:22,832 --> 01:41:23,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Rana,

883
01:41:26,049 --> 01:41:42,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily Gotti, and Jenna Matarazzo, with assistance from sophomore biology students, Dorven Edward, Enrique Ramos, Gabriela Paz-Luiz, and Jose Avelar Serrano, were able to join in in the planting.

884
01:41:43,418 --> 01:41:47,620
[SPEAKER_08]: We, the students, planted three of the ten trees and all ten blackberry bushes.

885
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:53,743
[SPEAKER_08]: We all enjoyed being outside, and despite the cold, working in the sunshine was surprisingly pleasant.

886
01:41:54,673 --> 01:42:03,798
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope to continue the project in the spring by creating a simple, low-cost outdoor classroom space so that teachers will be able to hold class in the space if they like.

887
01:42:04,799 --> 01:42:15,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Tufts College students are working on lesson plans that meet Massachusetts learning standards that teachers of various disciplines can utilize to integrate the Orchard with their class of desire.

888
01:42:15,805 --> 01:42:18,806
[SPEAKER_08]: The project was partially funded by CCSR and the Cummings Grant.

889
01:42:19,367 --> 01:42:19,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful.

890
01:42:20,027 --> 01:42:20,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Great job.

891
01:42:21,248 --> 01:42:21,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

892
01:42:23,947 --> 01:42:30,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.

893
01:42:30,753 --> 01:42:35,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Well you can see the enthusiasm and such a great idea and we're so happy that this has come to fruition.

894
01:42:35,737 --> 01:42:41,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you worked hard on it and you had a couple of setbacks but you kept going and that's the big learning lesson.

895
01:42:41,602 --> 01:42:43,704
[SPEAKER_07]: You kept pushing through so congratulations.

896
01:42:44,154 --> 01:42:45,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't wait to see the fruits of your labor.

897
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:50,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

898
01:42:50,139 --> 01:42:50,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Domenedetto.

899
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:59,266
[SPEAKER_06]: Was part of the reason you chose the interior courtyard because of the deer that come out in the evening?

900
01:42:59,286 --> 01:43:00,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And now the bear.

901
01:43:02,068 --> 01:43:04,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we have a bear in the midst, too.

902
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:08,073
[SPEAKER_04]: That was part of the reason, because we could better

903
01:43:10,175 --> 01:43:11,917
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, confine what we needed to.

904
01:43:11,957 --> 01:43:15,000
[SPEAKER_04]: We were worried about rodents and small animals.

905
01:43:15,061 --> 01:43:18,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we put it outside on the field, the kids practice and play on the field.

906
01:43:19,688 --> 01:43:21,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's another area where younger children play.

907
01:43:22,469 --> 01:43:24,749
[SPEAKER_04]: So this seemed like the perfect place for it.

908
01:43:25,349 --> 01:43:26,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a great idea.

909
01:43:26,489 --> 01:43:29,190
[SPEAKER_07]: More convenient, too, for the classroom aspect of it.

910
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:30,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like the idea.

911
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:31,951
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's going to look beautiful.

912
01:43:32,011 --> 01:43:34,731
[SPEAKER_06]: And that courtyard needed a little sprucing up.

913
01:43:35,651 --> 01:43:36,592
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

914
01:43:36,612 --> 01:43:36,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

915
01:43:37,092 --> 01:43:37,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

916
01:43:37,552 --> 01:43:39,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

917
01:43:39,852 --> 01:43:40,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved.

918
01:43:40,352 --> 01:43:43,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved by Mr. Bennis, seconded by Mr. Russo.

919
01:43:43,513 --> 01:43:44,233

01:43:44,253 --> 01:43:44,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

921

[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

923
01:43:46,734 --> 01:43:47,534

[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for giving me the report.

933
01:44:20,063 --> 01:44:20,643
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to.

934
01:44:20,703 --> 01:44:24,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, the heating system goes on when you start to talk.

935
01:44:24,285 --> 01:44:24,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

936
01:44:24,806 --> 01:44:25,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

937
01:44:26,207 --> 01:44:26,807
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let Ms.

938
01:44:26,867 --> 01:44:33,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Chen, who is the advisor of the club, read the report and then do further justice to the information.

939
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:34,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

940
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:46,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Method High School's robotic team has received a donation in the amount of $2,000 from MeDay Technology to compete in the New England Regional Bot Ball Competition 2019.

941
01:44:47,046 --> 01:45:03,597
[SPEAKER_00]: The robotics team at Method High School engaged students using science, engineering, technology, mathematics, and writing skills to design, build, program, and document robots in a hands-on project that reinforced their learning.

01:46:07,156 --> 01:46:07,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Great job.

964
01:46:10,377 --> 01:46:10,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

965
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:12,058
[SPEAKER_07]: DiBenedetto has a question.

966
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:28,482
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to take an opportunity to say thank you as well.

967
01:46:29,851 --> 01:46:31,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, both of you.

968
01:46:31,252 --> 01:46:31,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

969
01:46:33,073 --> 01:46:34,754
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to add one thing.

970
01:46:36,535 --> 01:46:38,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for acknowledging Ms.

971
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:38,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Chen.

972
01:46:38,756 --> 01:46:40,317
[SPEAKER_01]: She has worked incredibly hard.

973
01:46:40,457 --> 01:46:42,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Only last year I did it because Ms.

974
01:46:42,798 --> 01:46:49,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Chen's sister was going through some health issues and we lost her eventually.

975
01:46:50,102 --> 01:46:51,963
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the only time that Ms.

976
01:46:52,003 --> 01:46:53,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Chen has not been the advisor.

977
01:46:53,544 --> 01:46:54,284
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that,

978
01:46:54,664 --> 01:46:56,426
[SPEAKER_01]: She has been doing an amazing job.

979
01:46:56,486 --> 01:46:59,129
[SPEAKER_01]: She puts in immense amount of volunteer hours.

980
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:00,730
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for acknowledging.

981
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:01,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

982
01:47:05,174 --> 01:47:05,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

983
01:47:07,857 --> 01:47:12,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Item 4, report on advanced placement curriculum honor for Medford High School.

984
01:47:13,923 --> 01:47:14,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

985
01:47:14,143 --> 01:47:14,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Caldwell, please.

986
01:47:16,426 --> 01:47:28,393
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford Public School has been named to the ninth annual AP District Honor Roll, which recognizes schools that increase access to and performance on advanced placement programs.

987
01:47:29,093 --> 01:47:34,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Only 373 school districts around the United States and Canada were selected for this honor.

988
01:47:35,257 --> 01:47:47,261
[SPEAKER_04]: The AP District Honor Roll is administered by the Advanced Placement Program, which enables willing and academically prepared students to pursue college-level studies while still in high school.

989
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:54,744
[SPEAKER_04]: The program consists of college-level courses developed by the AP program that high schools can choose to offer.

990
01:47:55,404 --> 01:47:58,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Corresponding exams are administered once a year.

991
01:47:59,165 --> 01:48:04,407
[SPEAKER_04]: The AP District Honor Roll recognizes schools that are committed to increasing access to AP

992
01:48:05,207 --> 01:48:14,911
[SPEAKER_04]: for underrepresented students while simultaneously maintaining or increasing the percentage of students earning AP exam scores of 3 or higher.

993
01:48:15,732 --> 01:48:26,837
[SPEAKER_04]: The distinction of being named to this honor roll means Medford is committed to expanding the availability of AP courses among prepared and motivated students of all backgrounds.

994
01:48:27,786 --> 01:48:46,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford High School has increased the number of students participating in advanced placement courses over the past three years, while also increasing or maintaining the percentage of students earning scores of three or higher on AP exams.

995
01:48:47,258 --> 01:48:56,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Per the college board, reaching these goals shows that Medford is to successfully motivating and academically, thank you, preparing students who are ready for AP.

996
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:12,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Medford was one of 19 total schools recognized in Massachusetts, which included Brookline, Natick, Newburyport, Pembroke, Linfield, Shrewsbury, Mattapoisette, Norwell, Menden, Marshfield, Lunenburg, South Deerfield,

997
01:49:13,463 --> 01:49:17,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Ternus Falls, Belchertown, Kingston, South Hadley, and Westborough.

998
01:49:18,227 --> 01:49:26,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you know, in the state of Massachusetts, we have approximately 354 districts right here in Massachusetts.

999
01:49:26,634 --> 01:49:28,936
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is quite an honor for Medford High School.

1000
01:49:28,956 --> 01:49:29,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

1001
01:49:32,839 --> 01:49:33,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Very nice.

1002
01:49:33,319 --> 01:49:37,443
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

1003
01:49:37,463 --> 01:49:38,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Rousseau.

1004
01:49:38,984 --> 01:49:39,564
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1005
01:49:39,584 --> 01:49:39,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1006
01:49:40,205 --> 01:49:40,805

[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1010
01:49:47,207 --> 01:49:47,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Patterson.

1011
01:49:48,808 --> 01:49:59,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just a revisit to the original approval back on October 1st, but it was important to make sure that everybody understood the cost impact of this.

1012
01:49:59,937 --> 01:50:04,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It has increased based on the number of required items needed.

1013
01:50:05,061 --> 01:50:11,587
[SPEAKER_03]: So the new timeline that we have been negotiating with the company is a three-year payment term.

1014
01:50:12,182 --> 01:50:18,525
[SPEAKER_03]: We did get, we're still fine tuning the legal terminology within the contract, but year one would be $139,326.

1015
01:50:18,585 --> 01:50:19,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Year two and three would be $69,663.

1016
01:50:19,525 --> 01:50:23,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would provide us the opportunity to begin the training, get the materials now to roll this out for fiscal year 19-20.

1017
01:50:23,167 --> 01:50:24,287
[SPEAKER_03]: So the revised quote came in at $278,652.

1018
01:50:41,811 --> 01:50:48,272
[SPEAKER_03]: which we are requesting to proceed and recommend this additional amount.

1019
01:50:49,373 --> 01:50:50,813
[SPEAKER_07]: So moved by Mr. Benedetto.

1020
01:50:50,873 --> 01:50:51,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second by Ms.

1021
01:50:52,033 --> 01:50:52,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Kreatz?

1022
01:50:52,613 --> 01:50:53,734
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote.

1023
01:50:53,754 --> 01:50:54,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo has a question.

1024
01:50:55,674 --> 01:50:56,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Russo.

1025
01:50:57,654 --> 01:50:59,395
[SPEAKER_12]: What does SRB option mean?

1026
01:50:59,755 --> 01:51:01,035
[SPEAKER_12]: I see it mentioned a few times.

1027
01:51:03,436 --> 01:51:08,877
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on page 103 on the right under bonus, then there's requires SRB option.

1028
01:51:11,628 --> 01:51:12,809
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not so obvious today.

1029
01:51:14,911 --> 01:51:18,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you referring to just the shipping costs?

1030
01:51:18,794 --> 01:51:20,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Requires SRB option.

1031
01:51:23,759 --> 01:51:30,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be something that Rocco Sieri would have identified as needed for the components.

1032
01:51:30,585 --> 01:51:32,847
[SPEAKER_03]: So the complete kits, the teacher materials,

1033
01:51:33,438 --> 01:51:36,499
[SPEAKER_03]: the living materials, and the miscellaneous items.

1034
01:51:36,559 --> 01:51:40,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be all inclusive of what the packet would entail.

1035
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:45,841
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize, I don't know the science acronym for that particular area.

1036
01:51:46,182 --> 01:51:47,122
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get it later.

1037
01:51:47,682 --> 01:51:47,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

1038
01:51:47,922 --> 01:51:48,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Mustone.

1039
01:51:49,743 --> 01:51:53,143
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to make sure, we will have these books for September.

1040
01:51:54,664 --> 01:51:58,665
[SPEAKER_03]: The intent is that they will be shipped out for the spring for training.

1041
01:51:59,139 --> 01:51:59,639
[SPEAKER_03]: This spring?

1042
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:00,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1043
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:02,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, so full rollout September 2019.

1044
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:03,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, full rollout.

1045
01:52:03,481 --> 01:52:04,341
[SPEAKER_18]: Great, thank you.

1046
01:52:04,721 --> 01:52:04,942
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1047
01:52:04,962 --> 01:52:05,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Patterson.

1048
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:07,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1049
01:52:07,803 --> 01:52:08,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1050
01:52:09,023 --> 01:52:10,324
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a motion on the floor.

1051
01:52:10,464 --> 01:52:11,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call vote, Ms.

1052
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:11,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Kreatz.

1053
01:52:11,925 --> 01:52:12,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1054
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:12,745
[SPEAKER_15]: DeMantek.

1055
01:52:12,965 --> 01:52:13,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1056
01:52:13,865 --> 01:52:13,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1057
01:52:13,985 --> 01:52:14,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Kreatz, yes.

1058
01:52:14,246 --> 01:52:14,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1059
01:52:14,466 --> 01:52:15,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Mustone.

1060
01:52:15,326 --> 01:52:15,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1061
01:52:15,906 --> 01:52:16,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1062
01:52:16,106 --> 01:52:16,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Turgell.

1063
01:52:16,767 --> 01:52:17,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1064
01:52:17,587 --> 01:52:18,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Mustone.

1065
01:52:18,147 --> 01:52:18,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1066
01:52:19,028 --> 01:52:19,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Ms.

1067
01:52:19,328 --> 01:52:19,628
[SPEAKER_15]: McNeil.

1068
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:20,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1069
01:52:20,688 --> 01:52:20,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Ma'am Rowe.

1070
01:52:21,289 --> 01:52:21,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1071
01:52:21,609 --> 01:52:23,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1072
01:52:23,229 --> 01:52:23,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1073
01:52:26,051 --> 01:52:26,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1074
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:26,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Mustone.

1075
01:52:27,617 --> 01:52:31,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Just rereading my notes, I made an oversight at our Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee.

1076
01:52:31,979 --> 01:52:38,922
[SPEAKER_18]: Officer Bill Mazzacca was present, and I do feel remiss if I don't say that I appreciate his input at that meeting as well.

1077
01:52:39,462 --> 01:52:39,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1078
01:52:39,722 --> 01:52:40,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1079
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:47,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Under New Business, School Committee Resolution.

1080
01:52:48,526 --> 01:52:48,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Burke.

1081
01:52:49,447 --> 01:52:50,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Rousseau.

1082
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,761
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to ask a question perhaps of Ms.

1083
01:52:56,781 --> 01:53:02,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Patterson about our MSBA application.

1084
01:53:02,462 --> 01:53:02,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sure.

1085
01:53:03,582 --> 01:53:08,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we get feedback or do they just simply give us a no?

1086
01:53:08,983 --> 01:53:13,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Like is there something about our application they dislike or think that we can do differently?

1087
01:53:13,284 --> 01:53:13,504
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1088
01:53:13,844 --> 01:53:18,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I did call MSBA directly and inquired if there was something

1089
01:53:21,205 --> 01:53:26,130
[SPEAKER_03]: terminology that could be more aggressive or make us more needy in that context.

1090
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:30,313
[SPEAKER_03]: The short answer is no, that each year it's a new year.

1091
01:53:30,594 --> 01:53:33,016
[SPEAKER_03]: There are districts that have been filing since 2008.

1092
01:53:33,897 --> 01:53:44,106
[SPEAKER_03]: It just is a matter of the significant need based on enrollment factors and the conditions of the building of whichever project that they are looking at.

1093
01:53:44,563 --> 01:53:48,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the core projects, core projects alone were over 70 projects.

1094
01:53:49,044 --> 01:53:55,046
[SPEAKER_03]: So only a small amount based on the amount of funding per the state is available.

1095
01:53:55,526 --> 01:54:03,348
[SPEAKER_03]: There are accelerated projects that are available, but again, those are for roof, boiler, and windows only.

1096
01:54:03,809 --> 01:54:07,610
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is something to explore down the road, but again, we keep our...

1097
01:54:09,147 --> 01:54:12,991
[SPEAKER_03]: capital improvement listing, and we can certainly update it and address it.

1098
01:54:13,091 --> 01:54:17,395
[SPEAKER_03]: We did fine tune it based on the merger of the vocational and high school this year.

1099
01:54:17,855 --> 01:54:23,200
[SPEAKER_03]: We will, again, go out for the application period that opens at the end of January.

1100
01:54:23,661 --> 01:54:28,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Submissions typically go in for February, March, and April.

1101
01:54:29,299 --> 01:54:29,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1102
01:54:29,579 --> 01:54:31,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Van der Kloot.

1103
01:54:32,022 --> 01:54:33,504
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, just one question on that.

1104
01:54:33,684 --> 01:54:40,592
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the concerns that was brought to us is the heating in the gym, and I've always been concerned about the windows.

1105
01:54:41,092 --> 01:54:44,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Have we included those in our submission?

1106
01:54:44,376 --> 01:54:44,556
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1107
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:49,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that's the core program.

1108
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:51,702
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't a separate application just for the windows.

1109
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:52,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1110
01:54:52,462 --> 01:54:53,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to look.

1111
01:54:53,783 --> 01:54:54,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1112
01:54:54,143 --> 01:54:57,645
[SPEAKER_03]: And the heating is really infrastructure.

1113
01:54:57,846 --> 01:54:59,266
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the HVAC system.

1114
01:54:59,327 --> 01:55:01,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a significant cost.

1115
01:55:02,088 --> 01:55:04,390
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to be looking at that.

1116
01:55:04,410 --> 01:55:06,351
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have new boilers that we put in three, four years ago.

1117
01:55:06,471 --> 01:55:06,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

1118
01:55:07,232 --> 01:55:07,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the boilers.

1119
01:55:08,573 --> 01:55:09,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

1120
01:55:10,474 --> 01:55:12,675
[SPEAKER_07]: The handlers and all those other gadgets.

1121
01:55:14,857 --> 01:55:15,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1122
01:55:15,057 --> 01:55:15,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Bustone.

1123
01:55:16,046 --> 01:55:18,126
[SPEAKER_18]: Any of the 14 school districts that were funded?

1124
01:55:18,967 --> 01:55:20,967
[SPEAKER_18]: The 12 will be listed.

1125
01:55:21,187 --> 01:55:21,487
[SPEAKER_18]: They will?

1126
01:55:21,607 --> 01:55:21,847
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1127
01:55:22,187 --> 01:55:22,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1128
01:55:23,507 --> 01:55:24,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1129
01:55:27,648 --> 01:55:33,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Under new business, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Julie Green.

1130
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:34,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

1131
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:38,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Green was the sister of State Representative Christine Barber, representing Medford and Somerville.

1132
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:40,891
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could all please rise for a moment of silence, please.

1133
01:55:54,692 --> 01:56:15,968
[SPEAKER_07]: motion to adjourn this meeting I want to wish everyone a wonderful holiday season happy new year we'll see you back though I think the second week of January we're back I think so second week because it's New Year's Eve is the first yeah yeah so enjoy everyone stay safe and look forward to seeing you next year
