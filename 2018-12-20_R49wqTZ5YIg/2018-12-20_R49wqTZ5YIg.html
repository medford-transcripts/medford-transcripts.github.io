    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2556.684s">So</a>  I will try to bring the highlights. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2558.285s">We</a>  did have a follow-up buildings and grounds subcommittee meeting on November 29th. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2562.088s">It</a>  was a follow-up from our meeting last May to hear about updates in security and safety at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2571.195s">So</a>  present were four school committee members, the superintendent, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2575.897s">two</a>  parents of both elementary and high school age students. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2580.298s">We</a>  had three Medford police officers, Lieutenant Covino, Officer Ziobro, and Officer Lokowitz. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2586.86s">The</a>  director of buildings and grounds was in attendance, director of nursing, the high school principal, and the assistant superintendent, Miss Patterson. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2594.483s">So</a>  we had a good representation of everyone at the high school building. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2600.144s">First</a>  item that Officer Ziobro shared with us is that he does attend <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2605.563s">monthly</a>  meetings with the community-based justice coalition with the assistant district attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2614.185s">The</a>  director of nursing, Toni Wray, also attends, and it's to address high-level risk situations and highly troubled students that they are paying attention to. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2627.639s">Second</a>  was the safe haven report at that time was not released to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2634.184s">It</a>  was understood that it is a Department of Homeland Security document and it is a privileged document. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2641.283s">Parts</a>  that can be shared will be shared when it is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2646.108s">Third</a>  was all the cameras have been fixed or are currently being fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2651.212s">So</a>  all the cameras in all of the school buildings are fixed or are on a list to be fixed happening currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2658.438s">Next,</a>  oh, some question was asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2660.46s">There</a>  are 95 cameras on the high school campus, and it is privileged information where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2668.133s">The</a>  other concern parents had was the doors being marked from the outside of the school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2674.376s">Currently,</a>  there are doors that were unmarked that are now being marked by Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2684.942s">The</a>  next highlight was that Mr. DeLava shared that on November 6, there was a training about safety care for kids in crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2692.305s">He</a>  wanted to thank the Medford Police Department for their continuing <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2695.875s">training</a>  and building relationships with students. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2700.117s">Mr.</a>  DeLeva also shared that dogs from area police departments and the state police came to do some training in the building, both for drugs and ballistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2711.901s">We</a>  did learn that different dogs are trained for specific sins, differing between drug paraphernalia and ballistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2723.23s">We</a>  did, after the safety update, we did discuss the feminine hygiene products being installed in the high school, and that will be in a follow-up report with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2732.28s">Diane</a>  Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2734.022s">I</a>  don't know if my fellow members, Erin and, I mean, Committee Member DiVenedetto and Committee Member Kreatz are both on the <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2741.887s">buildings</a>  and grout subcommittee and committee member Van der Kloot was in attendance and that is all I have to share.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2747.772s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2748.232s">Thank</a>  you very much, Madam Chairwoman. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2750.414s">Are</a>  there any other comments on this report? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2754.297s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2756.719s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2757.88s">Will</a>  the response to the sanitary materials and bathrooms, which I don't think that's actually on the agenda, is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2766.387s">So</a>  maybe we should discuss it.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2767.929s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2768.029s">Caldwell.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2769.97s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2771.236s">So</a>  Mr. Russo, I'd like to thank you for bringing this to our attention earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2775.299s">And</a>  we have worked with some CCSR members to make sure that we have been responsive to the needs of our girls. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2784.567s">So</a>  Director Toni Wray, who's our supervisor of nurses, and Director John McLaughlin of our buildings and grounds and I <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2792.681s">got</a>  together to resolve the concerns around sanitary products in our ladies' restrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2798.985s">It</a>  was decided that we will order five product dispensers that are coin-free and place them in the bathrooms <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2808.496s">in</a>  the following locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2810.499s">So</a>  if you're in C building on floors 1, 2, and 3, they will be in the bathrooms outside of C building. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2820.011s">We</a>  will also put a dispenser in the vocational school on the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2825.698s">and</a>  we thought it might be wise to have one in the girls' gym area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2830.699s">These</a>  products will be free to our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2833.94s">Buildings</a>  and grounds will supply and fill the dispensers. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2837.581s">The</a>  estimated cost for the dispensers of these products will be around $1,100, but then after I got the quotes from John McLaughlin, it comes to about $950. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2850.143s">Students</a>  can still go to the nurse's office if they're by the nurse's office on the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2854.546s">And</a>  I know there's some question about whether we can fill them with tampons, but according to Director Ray, we cannot do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2863.27s">But</a>  I'm happy to announce at least we can get free products for our girls in the ladies' rooms.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2868.593s">I'm</a>  happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2870.374s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2871.535s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2872.395s">This</a>  is a lot of progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2873.376s">I</a>  really do appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2876.572s">Is</a>  Miss Ray here now? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2880.333s">She</a>  is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2882.333s">She</a>  says that we cannot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2884.634s">But</a>  in New York State, they have a law that went into effect on July 1, mandating that from sixth through 12th grade, every single bathroom have both pads and tampons for free in every public school in their state. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2897.996s">So</a>  we're a long way from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2902.81s">And</a>  I'm hopeful that my work with the legislature to make this the law in Massachusetts soon will happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2909.175s">I'm</a>  just wondering if we do some of what we're planning and then the legislature says we have to do effectively the same thing, will we be able to reuse what we've already done or will we have to start over?</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2920.665s">I</a>  don't believe we'd have to start over. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2922.186s">We</a>  can look at what we've done and I think can move forward with that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2925.189s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2925.689s">I</a>  mean, so is there a change to the <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2928.292s">It</a>  says it's outside the assistant principal's office.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2931.315s">Well,</a>  that's just the location. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2933.236s">It's</a>  right outside the assistant principal's office, but it's in the ladies' rooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2936.939s">Oh,</a>  see, that's not clear.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2938.32s">It</a>  looked like it was in the hall.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2940.102s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2940.742s">I'm</a>  like, this is not making sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2943.965s">And</a>  how long does it take from the furthest point on building on 1, 2, or 3? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2950.864s">What</a>  is the furthest distance to walk to one of these within the school?</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2955.727s">A</a>  building. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2957.208s">I</a>  guess it depends how quickly you walk. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2959.87s">But</a>  I really don't think it's a long distance.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2961.131s">Well,</a>  let's say you need one of these urgently. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2962.351s">You're</a>  probably not running.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2965.033s">It's</a>  a few minutes, I would reckon. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2966.814s">It's</a>  about a few minutes.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2967.475s">Because</a>  I still get lost at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2968.816s">So</a>  to me, it's like a 25-minute walk to try and figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2973.078s">OK,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2973.839s">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2974.199s">A</a>  couple minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2975.24s">It's</a>  just a couple minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2976.481s">All</a>  right, that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2977.881s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2979.915s">So</a>  I guess I would really like to hear a follow-up as to why tampons cannot... I mean, the dispensers themselves may not be capable of it, and so that is an issue if we need to pick a different dispenser. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2989.503s">But</a>  I mean, it seems like we're making a decision for girls whether they can use pads or tampons. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=2999.946s">I'm</a>  already having that conversation with the fifth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3002.188s">So</a>  I don't think this is really a decision for the school system to decide.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3005.85s">I</a>  would have to speak to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3007.852s">Ray</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3008.532s">I</a>  think she knows more about it than I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3010.594s">But</a>  we can have a follow-up conversation with her.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3015.257s">This</a>  is a possible answer.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3017.138s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3017.198s">Mustone.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3017.779s">I</a>  don't know the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3019.78s">The</a>  only thing I could think of is maybe it's possible that because of toxic shock syndrome, that it's not something that the school feels comfortable, because then you'd be liable, God forbid, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3029.48s">someone</a>  came with toxic shock syndrome.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3037.684s">I</a>  feel like one of the least qualified people around this space to talk about this, but I had to learn about toxic shock syndrome in the little books that I had to read for my own child. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3052.157s">It's</a>  the frequency of changing them that is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3054.898s">So</a>  not having them seems like we're setting ourselves up for a liability versus having them. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3060.1s">So</a>  I don't really follow the logic that not having them is better because we just want to pretend nothing's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3070.244s">If</a>  we're putting the pads in there, then we are saying that we care about this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3077.127s">And</a>  if you make the decision as a girl to use tampons, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3081.817s">Well,</a>  that's not our problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3083.439s">And</a>  I just think that's not OK.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3084.661s">I</a>  think she's going to check with the nursing department to see what's legal in masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3087.565s">I'll</a>  do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3087.985s">I'll</a>  follow up. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3088.806s">Maybe</a>  we're different than New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3089.928s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3092.964s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3093.144s">Van</a>  der Kloot is next. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3095.406s">I</a>  think we need you to check into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3097.108s">We</a>  received an email just before the meeting tonight asking us why we were not providing both. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3104.314s">It</a>  seemed to be well thought out and certainly convincing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3109.618s">And</a>  if the machine doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3112.697s">support,</a>  there's always a little basket or something that we might be able to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3120.066s">So</a>  if you would get back to us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3122.009s">On</a>  the other hand, as you said, Paul, we're making progress, and I'm glad that we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3127.656s">And</a>  I certainly think the initial <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3131.26s">And</a>  I think the disbursement of in the locations that you described should say, let's see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3137.906s">But</a>  our objective should be to provide the supplies throughout the entire schools.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3148.235s">You</a>  mean for middle schools as well?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3151.097s">I</a>  think we'll start here. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3152.338s">And</a>  I think in a short time we need to evaluate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3154.84s">And,</a>  you know, I think that's our objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3158.382s">My</a>  objective, now that it's been raised to us, it makes a lot of sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3161.063s">So</a>  anyway, if you would get back to us on that question, and we'll...

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3169.207s">Jonathan</a>  just shared that the current dispensers have dual capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3173.849s">So</a>  if the time comes that you need to dispense dual products, you can.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3178.571s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3179.212s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3179.452s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3182.873s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3184.825s">I</a>  make a motion to accept this as is and revisit it in January and ask Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3189.929s">Ray</a>  to report on additional adding of other options for our students.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3197.736s">On</a>  the motion to accept this report as amended with a request for a follow-up on the status of t-cons in these machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3205.623s">Is</a>  there a second, Mr. Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3206.644s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3207.765s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3208.405s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3209.246s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3210.367s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3212.798s">The</a>  Rules Subcommittee, December 3rd, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3215.76s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3216.0s">Kreatz,</a>  chairwoman.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3222.445s">And</a>  we discussed the final draft copy function of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3227.909s">We</a>  were struggling with one of the functions, number five. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3231.712s">So</a>  between our last meeting and this meeting, I went in and I met with city solicitor Mark Rumley, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3242.321s">to</a>  get some help with him on the wording of what the possible consequences could be for a school committee member who was in violation of one of the policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3253.889s">So</a>  we reviewed the draft together and I came up with the new number five, which I put a copy in front of each of your tables this evening due to the last minute meeting that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3266.379s">We</a>  also had another meeting this evening from 6 to 618 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3273.205s">so</a>  that we could vote on the new final draft, including the updates to number five, and also including some different wording because we want to make sure that we weren't in violation with the law or the First Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3291.34s">So</a>  what you have in front of you right now is what was <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3295.32s">looked</a>  at by City Solicitor Mark Rumley, and he said that the way it reads right now, we are in violation with the law in the First Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3305.104s">So</a>  if everybody was in agreement with it, what we could do is we could, you know, ask maybe if we could put it on school letterhead, and then we could sign it at one of the future meetings, if there's something that you want to see in it differently, or if you have an idea that you wanted to see in it, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3324.072s">You</a>  know, we'd be happy to hear from you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3330.116s">Is</a>  there a motion to send this to Committee of the Whole, or do you want to send it to the floor?</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3334.499s">Actually,</a>  if we talked about it this evening, and we feel like it's ready to go to the floor, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3344.475s">if</a>  everybody's okay with the way, it's supposed to be the key functions of the school committee, not the policies. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3352.258s">So</a>  it's not a listing of everything that we do on school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3357.5s">It's</a>  the key components. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3363.463s">So</a>  I'm not sure if you want to have a committee of the whole, that is something that we could do and we could talk about it <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3372.35s">some</a>  time in January or February. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3374.612s">If,</a>  you know, if this evening, if everybody's reviewed it over the last couple, I think you've got to draft another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3381.597s">We</a>  did take out some language that wasn't legal or was in, it was in violation with the First Amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3389.223s">So</a>  that's why, you know, if we were going to add anything else, we'd want to have either cities or both city solicitor Mark Marmoley and Howard Greenspan review it just to make sure we are, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3401.338s">legally</a>  incompliant before we put anything on our website and sign it.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3406.84s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3407.201s">DiBenedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3408.941s">So</a>  I have to say I don't love number five. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3412.883s">If</a>  a school committee member acts in a fashion that is unbecoming, may be subject to censure by two-thirds of the vote of the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3420.847s">Well,</a>  what items are unbecoming? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3422.587s">Who</a>  decides that? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3423.948s">Like,</a>  that just can be anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3427.129s">And</a>  censure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3429.623s">I</a>  don't report to my fellow members. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3431.864s">I</a>  report to the people who voted for me to be their voice at this seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3438.106s">And</a>  so I would pull off item five totally. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3445.568s">And</a>  I wouldn't sign off on this document with that on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3451.65s">And</a>  I think people would have a hard time censoring me anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3456.232s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3460.84s">because</a>  that's my job as a committee member is to speak my mind for the people who are elected me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3466.183s">And</a>  if other people get a right to censor what I say or find that what I say is unbecoming because they don't like it for any way, shape, or form, or my attitude, or the way that I might present it, or how passionate I am about an issue, I think is very dangerous to put in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3484.311s">And</a>  I think it would be so impossible to regulate <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3488.204s">Because</a>  I think you know me for eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3491.107s">I'm</a>  hot enough to regulate. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3492.429s">It's</a>  just not going to work.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3496.933s">Mr.</a>  Ruggiero. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3499.276s">We</a>  spent a lot of time thinking about the idea of consequences and what the consequences are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3503.28s">And</a>  this is something we debated back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3505.673s">According</a>  to Robert's Rules of Order, we have the authority now, whether we sign the document or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3511.015s">And</a>  what is activity on becoming a member is actually a subjective element. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3517.878s">The</a>  idea, though, is censure has, you are ultimately responsible to the members of Medford, and the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3528.062s">So</a>  what you say is not, while we can censor you, it's what your authority is to the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3535.207s">So,</a>  I mean, the idea, we wanted to add some element that we debated this idea back and forth quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3543.31s">Ultimately,</a>  we came down on the idea that there should be some sort of provision for a member that we felt acts in violation with the things that we're signing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3552.793s">Otherwise,</a>  it's just a piece of paper.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3554.854s">And</a>  I think in the sessions that we had over the last several months with our association of school committees, they spoke about <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3561.805s">setting</a>  up guidelines for behavior, not behavior, but in what our role really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3567.067s">And</a>  what are we trying to deliver to the school students of our community? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3572.589s">And</a>  I didn't see it more as how we were acting, but if we were going astray to bring us back into what our role is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3579.831s">So</a>  censure to me is a very harsh word, but I do recall her saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3584.573s">And</a>  I guess I'd be interested in seeing some examples from other communities that she had given to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3592.255s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3592.375s">Superintendent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3593.256s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3594.797s">And</a>  these five rules were based upon the samples that other districts are currently using. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3601.563s">So</a>  it was kind of like a potpourri, but the language that was removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3608.728s">Mark</a>  Rumley said, you know, the pieces that needed to be removed were removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3614.353s">But</a>  again, there's always a possibility of doing a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3619.177s">And</a>  we can also revisit this in another retreat <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3622.205s">Dorothy</a>  Presser, also talking about norms and rules of engagement, going deeper with that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3630.253s">Can</a>  I make a recommendation that someone send it to Committee of the Whole so that we can deliberate it and there's other things that have to get done this night? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3637.93s">Okay,</a>  motion to send to Committee of the Whole, offered by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3642.532s">Kreatz.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3642.812s">Before</a>  I call the roll, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3644.273s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3644.753s">Yes,</a>  before you call the roll, there's just one other sentence that I wish the committee to look at, because I kept on reading it and kept on reading it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3650.676s">Well,</a>  it's going to be in Committee of the Whole now, so we can all look at it collectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3652.676s">Oh,</a>  it's going to go to Committee of the Whole? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3654.217s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3654.377s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3655.058s">If</a>  it gets voted on to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3657.218s">I'll</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3658.099s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3659.634s">Roll</a>  call vote, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3660.514s">Send</a>  this paper to Committee of the Whole.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3661.995s">Mrs.</a>  DeVantage, yes.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3663.675s">Mrs.</a>  Graves, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3665.036s">Mrs.</a>  Stone, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3666.396s">Mr.</a>  Regano, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3667.196s">Mrs.</a>  Chew, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3668.237s">Mrs.</a>  Vanderbilt, yes.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3670.657s">Mrs.</a>  Vanderbilt, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3672.938s">I</a>  believe Mrs. Stone was a yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3674.539s">No,</a>  I was a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3675.359s">You</a>  were a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3676.299s">7</a>  in the affirmative, 0 in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3677.58s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3680.353s">Community</a>  Relations Subcommittee, December 11, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3682.476s">Mr.</a>  Jarrell.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3692.635s">safety</a>  involvement and volunteering, but that's something we're still doing some more research on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3697.397s">There</a>  are three papers that we would like to have considered in the entire meeting, so I'll just go through the first of them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3705.401s">The</a>  first item that was referred to us many months ago was about digital documents being posted online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3712.145s">Currently,</a>  many parents have asked me to post items personally, but we as a committee felt it would be best if we had a unified policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3722.109s">So,</a>  originally we wanted to do a number of research, which we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3726.692s">First,</a>  we spoke with Dorothy Presser. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3728.893s">She's</a>  our representative for the Massachusetts Association of School Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3733.835s">She</a>  has no official position. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3736.316s">There's</a>  no official guidance on digital documents being posted online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3741.279s">However,</a>  she hasn't heard any negative feedback from the communities that do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3746.561s">They</a>  also don't track it, but she said probably a sizable minority, maybe 40%, maybe 30% of communities do post online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3756.912s">So</a>  after that, I called a number of different school committees and mostly superintendent's offices to see their position and see <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3766.462s">what</a>  effect it had in their community posting these documents online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3771.943s">There</a>  were basically four major areas that I asked them. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3776.064s">First,</a>  I asked them to describe their posting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3778.825s">All</a>  of the communities I had a chance to talk to had different processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3783.205s">Second,</a>  I asked, did it help or hurt the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3786.226s">And</a>  what problems have you had in the implementation? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3789.127s">Thirdly,</a>  I asked, what system did you use to post? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3792.407s">And</a>  finally, I asked, did they have any unforeseen problems that arose? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3797.688s">In</a>  short, all the communities I spoke to felt very positively about posting documents online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3803.83s">None</a>  reported any significant problems from people using documents in a way that was not becoming or productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3814.312s">First,</a>  I spoke with some people at Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3818.093s">I</a>  spoke to Diane Hogan. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3819.333s">She's</a>  the assistant to the superintendent there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3821.874s">Overall,</a>  she believed that they had a positive experience of posting packets online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3826.736s">Their</a>  community posted packets 72 hours in advance, and they use a program called Grayness, which is used by the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3838.939s">Diane,</a>  or Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3839.739s">Hogan,</a>  believed it helped the community in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3842.488s">And</a>  they've been doing it since 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3843.589s">They</a>  also felt that there's a tendency for rumors to sort of spread through a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3850.695s">But</a>  with the digital documents there, she felt that those kind of rumors were stymied. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3856.981s">I</a>  left a message with the people at Danvers, but they weren't able to get back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3860.164s">And</a>  I also called a couple of other districts and weren't able to get back to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3865.767s">But</a>  the people at Redding, whose name, the last name of this lady I unfortunately forgot to write down, her name was Linda. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3871.853s">She</a>  was also an executive assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3874.596s">She</a>  believed that they had a very positive experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3877.298s">They</a>  posted 48 hours in advance of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3881.282s">And</a>  they used PDFs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3882.743s">So</a>  they don't, they do not pay for any expensive system. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3885.726s">They</a>  just post PDFs online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3888.813s">Franklin</a>  Public Schools, I spoke to Denise Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3892.337s">They've</a>  had also a very positive experience with posting. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3895.601s">They</a>  felt like there were no problems with doing anything online. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3900.187s">What</a>  they did was a system, actually I'm going to recommend that we do, they send a link <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3904.633s">to</a>  school committee members first. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3907.056s">School</a>  committee members have a few hours to review the materials in advance, and then the link is sent to the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3915.704s">They</a>  don't send presentations or superintendent notes beforehand, and they also use just PDFs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3922.15s">Finally,</a>  I spoke to the people at Lexington. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3925.072s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3925.392s">Calvino</a>  is the executive assistant there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3927.974s">She</a>  was the most enthusiastic about posting documents online in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3932.676s">She</a>  felt that it was very helpful to members of the community, and she would have actually parents call her back if they were spelling errors or typos online, so that was something that they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3942.522s">She</a>  believes lots of parents use the documents and look forward to the packets to make sure that when they come to school committee meetings, they're prepared in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3951.947s">She</a>  did have or their community had a little problem with posting PDFs on a timetable that the community understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3960.132s">So</a>  they just recommend that maybe we have a trial period first to make sure that all the wrinkles are ironed out and yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3968.594s">So</a>  there's no confusion about when things are posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3972.577s">So</a>  our committee unanimously voted to do a similar program as they do in Franklin. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3980.782s">We</a>  would like there to be a link sent to all school committee members at 12 noon to all school committee members, and then a link sent to the community at large at 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=3992.898s">These</a>  links would be in our entire packets, but what is confidential or materials that need to be presented and put in context?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4000.383s">Can</a>  I interrupt you for a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4001.484s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4001.704s">Is</a>  that in your committee report? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4002.905s">Because</a>  I don't see that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4004.106s">No,</a>  we haven't voted on the minutes yet.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4005.867s">So</a>  you're going to go back to committee?</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4007.808s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4009.409s">We</a>  voted to send it to school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4011.891s">I</a>  wasn't sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4012.391s">Can</a>  we send?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4016.08s">But</a>  we didn't vote on those minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4018.384s">So</a>  we didn't get that committee report yet.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4021.789s">Yeah,</a>  we haven't voted on those minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4023.952s">But</a>  I believe at this point we've done a good amount of research on this issue and we can move this forward.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4030.797s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4030.957s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4031.998s">We</a>  don't have that in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4033.338s">Michael,</a>  I didn't realize that you didn't have the written minutes for this meeting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4038.181s">So</a>  you need the minutes for this meeting.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4040.662s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4041.202s">So</a>  you are reporting on things. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4044.104s">The</a>  only thing is that there is one item that, because of a time constraint, needs to be reported out from the subcommittee right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4051.648s">So</a>  in some ways, the other stuff you're providing for us on this topic, we don't have a report on. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4061.494s">The</a>  piece that we need to report out because of a time constraint, if I <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4066.77s">if</a>  I can proceed, or do you want to go with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4069.292s">Well,</a>  I, oh, we can go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4072.193s">You</a>  can speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4073.234s">Okay,</a>  so there's the piece that we need to proceed on is that the subcommittee suggested, Michael's been talking about other ways to make us accessible to the community, and the subcommittee had a long discussion about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4088.904s">And</a>  one suggestion was providing, rather than a formal meeting, an opportunity for the community to have a <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4096.068s">meet-and-greet</a>  for school committee members for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4102.297s">And</a>  to that end, we were thinking about what events already brought the community out, and there's one coming up in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4113.471s">which</a>  is the Medford Family Network Valentine's Social. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4118.472s">And</a>  so we discussed the possibility of having a meet-and-greet hour before the Valentine's Social, so that at the Valentine's Social, we customarily go and we scoop ice cream, and it's really nice to see people, but it's not an opportunity to get into much conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4138.078s">I</a>  did speak to Marie Cassidy about this, and she understood, and she said that if we were to proceed on this, she could put a line in her flyer to say prior, you know, from 2 to 3, come meet the school committee, or whatever, from 11 to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4159.815s">But</a>  because she's getting that information out to the public, we should <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4165.235s">That's</a>  the piece that's critical for tonight.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4167.941s">So</a>  is there a motion to have the school committee hold a meet and greet the day of the social? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4174.179s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4174.979s">That</a>  was the recommendation of the committee?</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4176.22s">Well,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4176.94s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4177.08s">I'm</a>  just, I'm a little confused on the logistics of this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4180.381s">So</a>  the minutes of the meeting haven't been posted because we haven't voted on our last meeting yet.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4186.322s">You</a>  vote at the end of your meeting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4189.243s">We</a>  did vote at the end of our meeting to send these, to send the digital documents meeting forward to the whole committee.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4195.764s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4196.184s">So</a>  there's two items I would like to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4199.114s">that</a>  we vote for the meet and greet, and two, also, that we start posting digital documents online, which we've cleared with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4206.936s">That</a>  shouldn't be a problem to do.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4209.917s">We</a>  don't have a report.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4212.838s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto, does two items on up, I second having the meet and greet on February, would have a day that, is it actually Valentine's Day?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4224.881s">I</a>  can't remember what date it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4226.522s">I</a>  think it's the second Saturday.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4229.017s">OK,</a>  so at the Valentine's Day social that the Method Family Network provides, I second the motion on the floor for us to have that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4240.286s">Let's</a>  move that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4241.287s">That's</a>  separate from the committee report.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4243.769s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4244.189s">On</a>  the motion offered by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4245.55s">Vandekloot,</a>  seconded by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4248.152s">All</a>  those in favor to host a meet and greet an hour before the Valentine social. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4252.956s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4254.117s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4254.537s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4255.678s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4256.398s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4260.167s">confused</a>  because he thought he was bringing the report to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4262.928s">I</a>  have to explain that when you talked to me about it, I thought that the report that was on my desk was the report of this past meeting that we had on December 11th.</p>

    <p>[Kristy Avino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4318.485s">Hi</a>  everyone, thank you so much for having us here. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4320.968s">I'm</a>  Christy Avino, this is Jenny Graham, and we are so excited to officially conclude our Disney Vacation Raffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4329.297s">When</a>  we came together this summer as a group of a dozen, between 12 and 20 parents, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4334.93s">and</a>  volunteers from the four elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4337.372s">We</a>  decided that we wanted to do just a few things to get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4340.234s">There</a>  were some things that we thought were too big, and then we decided to do this Disney raffle, and I think you'll find that this has set the bar really high for sure, so we're really thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4349.741s">Before</a>  we announce the winner, we want to say thank you to a few people who were really, really critical in our effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4356.525s">Thank</a>  you to Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, also to Allie Fisk and Deanna Devaney in the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4363.51s">Kevin</a>  Bailey and Danny Folks from the Recreation Department were very supportive, as was our City Clerk, Adam Herdeweis. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4371.012s">Our</a>  elementary school principals were really critical in supporting our efforts, so thank you to Principal Johnson, Principal Guarino, Principal Kaye, and Principal Galusi, as well as their staff and all of the teachers who helped support us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4385.075s">We</a>  also want to thank the PTO boards at the schools, and most importantly, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4390.355s">All</a>  of the parents and kids who sold tickets and spread the word about our raffle. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4394.899s">Some</a>  of our parents sold hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of tickets in support of this effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4400.624s">So</a>  we were really thrilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4402.385s">Some</a>  enterprising elementary students spent hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4405.908s">I</a>  promised my son I would give him a shout out. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4408.15s">He</a>  spent about 12 hours over six or seven events wearing his little Mickey ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4413.635s">And</a>  I think we can say safely he has a great career. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4416.393s">in</a>  either sales or politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4417.975s">He</a>  knows about half of Medford now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4420.758s">So</a>  thank you all to those people. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4423.001s">Our</a>  community was really, really gracious and supportive of us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4427.686s">Many</a>  welcomed us into their space and their events. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4430.369s">So</a>  we want to thank St. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4431.971s">Francis</a>  of Assisi Church, the Friends of Medford Public Library, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4435.772s">Atlas</a>  Liquors on Mystic Ave, Bertucci's on Mystic Valley Parkway, Metro Rock Gym in Everett, 4 Good Vibes on Main Street, Friends of the Fells, Salem Street Studio. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4445.454s">This</a>  was a really great effort from our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4448.095s">We</a>  also want to thank Wegmans for a very generous supporting donation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4452.616s">And</a>  thank you also to the Irish American Club because they lent us this fabulous little raffle wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4460.017s">I'm</a>  going to turn it over to Jenny to tell you a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4462.098s">Thank</a>  you, Kristen.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4463.875s">So</a>  there are a number of people who definitely won't win anything tonight, namely our raffle captains. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4473.019s">So</a>  there were 10 folks who were identified as captains at the outset of this effort who were expressly prohibited from buying tickets, although they were asked to spend lots and lots and lots of hours helping other people be eligible to win. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4486.243s">Our</a>  raffle captains included Christy Aveno, Jen Conti, myself, Melissa Maywalt, Maureen McSweeney, Doug Nagengast, Gary Pabst, Cheryl Rodriguez, Bob Russo, and Bailey Schendel. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4498.033s">A</a>  special thank you to Tamara Morrow, who is the treasurer of the Brooks, and she is a raffle captain and the person who is responsible for the finances, the reporting, and raffle compliance, which is no small feat. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4512.005s">We've</a>  learned a lot about raffles. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4515.475s">But</a>  she has done an immensely huge task with ease. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4520.357s">So</a>  we sold 4,824 tickets and received some donations along the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4526.539s">Our</a>  gross sales were $24,178. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4528.5s">Yay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4538.482s">After</a>  we pay our raffle expenses, and we filed our required tax returns, and we pay our gaming taxes, our schools will each receive over $4,000, which is a huge addition to all of the PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4550.676s">So</a>  that's $4,000 to each elementary school, give or take. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4554.96s">the</a>  end of the bath. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4557.282s">We're</a>  just getting started. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4558.163s">We</a>  have two more events planned this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4560.366s">Our</a>  electronics recycling will return, and we'll have a Wizards game in the spring as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4565.631s">And</a>  there will be more to come on both. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4568.013s">But</a>  the reason that we're here is to pull the winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4570.696s">So</a>  the raffle wheel is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4572.969s">It's</a>  quite full. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4575.85s">We</a>  did mix everything around and shake it up and the wheel can be spun a few more times for good measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4582.653s">The</a>  first prize that we would like Dr. Edouard-Vincent to pull is the grand prize winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4587.555s">The</a>  grand prize of the raffle is $5,000 in Disney gift cards or a cash equivalent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4594.019s">The</a>  grand prize winner can, at their option, use the gift cards to book a vacation at a Disney resort or Disney cruise. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4600.204s">Shannon</a>  Demos, the assistant principal at the Brooks School, is a local resident Disney expert and has volunteered her time to help the winner plan their vacation, if they so choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4611.194s">The</a>  $5,000 grand prize may or may not cover the whole cost of a vacation, including airfare, accommodation, and dining, subject to the winner's booking preferences. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4618.94s">You</a>  can go to Disney all kinds of different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4622.082s">So</a>  $5,000 is kind of a blank canvas for whoever that winner is. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4627.204s">The</a>  winner must be 18 years of age or older and a US citizen or lawful permanent resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4632.446s">The</a>  winner must claim their prize in seven business days, so excluding Christmas, which is a federally recognized holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4637.689s">This</a>  means the prize must be claimed by December 27th at 5 or we will draw a new winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4642.971s">So</a>  if you would do the honors and pull the winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4647.669s">Spin</a>  that drum. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4648.75s">Reach</a>  in there really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4650.271s">Whoa,</a>  that is hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4653.694s">It</a>  is quite full.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4655.135s">Okay,</a>  the winner is Lynn Freitas, 26 Stearns Avenue, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4657.917s">Woo,</a>  all right.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4675.685s">Does</a>  anyone know Lynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4679.008s">Does</a>  anybody know Lynn? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4682.611s">We</a>  will take that and call her. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4685.313s">And</a>  then if you would also pull one more ticket, there is a second place prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4689.716s">It</a>  is a $250 Disney gift card. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4693.92s">The</a>  same rules apply about claiming the prize and US residents and all of that good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4698.123s">But</a>  the second prize winner will be pulled now. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4700.825s">It</a>  is packed.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4702.747s">We</a>  needed a bigger drum.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4704.908s">So</a>  next year we'll also be on the hunt for a slightly bigger drum.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4710.092s">We</a>  can get you one of the recycling bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4713.154s">Composting.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4716.497s">Alright,</a>  the winner is Mara Kennedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4719.499s">Mara</a>  Kennedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4721.14s">49</a>  Salton Stall Road, Medford.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4730.862s">Nice</a>  job.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4732.122s">So</a>  thank you very much for playing along here and pulling our winners. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4736.023s">So</a>  we'll take those from you, and we will take the wheel and empty it out and get it back to the Irish-American as well.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4741.524s">I</a>  know you all worked very, very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4744.145s">I</a>  saw you at so many events, including election day, pre-election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4748.646s">You</a>  guys were everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4749.746s">So</a>  kudos to all of you for what you've done in investing in your schools and our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4754.787s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4755.468s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4771.255s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4774.496s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4775.516s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4778.536s">Under</a>  community participation, I got a note from the daughter of Lena DeGentema, so regarding the event we had, those of you who don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4790.715s">We</a>  named the music room the Gigentmaso Music Room.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4794.157s">I</a>  think the superintendent had it in her comments.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4796.978s">Oh,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4798.659s">So</a>  from her daughter, she just wrote, Erin, thank you again for the wonderful evening last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4804.002s">The</a>  ceremony that the district provided was truly humbling. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4811.626s">And</a>  my mom loved this dedication more than words could tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4816.8s">Thank</a>  you for a wonderful, memorable night. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4819.322s">And</a>  please tell Lisa Evangelista we realize how much time and effort she put into the event. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4825.507s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4834.133s">Oh,</a>  hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4834.454s">That's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4835.655s">Sorry</a>  it was a little slow coming up for the participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4838.897s">Hi,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4839.958s">Hi,</a>  Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4840.819s">Hi,</a>  Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4841.98s">Hi,</a>  members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4843.681s">I'm</a>  Carolyn Montello, 108 Ashcroft Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4846.958s">And</a>  this evening, I wanted to bring up the issue of heat at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4853.764s">After</a>  a few recent very cold visits to the high school's Karen Theater and gym, I began to look into what might be the issue with the heat at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4864.453s">I</a>  was told that the heat in the theater is broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4868.096s">It</a>  sounds like a part has been ordered. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4870.626s">and</a>  should be installed soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4872.767s">But</a>  I was also informed that the gym only has one unit left working. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4877.708s">That's</a>  the unit in cage three. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4880.089s">And</a>  the others are basically gone and have been that way for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4885.491s">I</a>  also heard from parents recently that the school, that the pool area seems to be having heating issues as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4893.654s">And</a>  for years, I've heard from students as well as teachers that some of the classrooms are so cold in the winter <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4900.79s">that</a>  students need to wear their coats inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4904.071s">And</a>  a student this year told me that in one classroom, students are allowed to bring in blankets because it's so cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4913.315s">So</a>  I think most parents assume that their school is heated when they send their kids off to school in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4920.617s">So</a>  I don't think that people even think to ask the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4925.799s">I</a>  would like to ask a member of the committee to make a motion to immediately <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4931.141s">audit</a>  the current heating system throughout the high school, and provide an update at the next school committee meeting, and make any repairs if and as needed.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4941.724s">So</a>  moved by member Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4944.225s">Also,</a>  just regarding the theater, a coil is on order, and it will be installed over the holidays. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4950.386s">the</a>  holiday break. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4951.386s">So</a>  that's the worst case it will be installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4954.007s">And</a>  two out of the four heaters are working in the gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4956.728s">Does</a>  it say enough heat?</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4959.829s">It's</a>  sufficient heat in the gym area?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4963.35s">It's</a>  two out of four. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4964.49s">Two</a>  out of four. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4966.21s">So</a>  you're going to hear a little later from the superintendent on an item that we applied for MSBA school funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4974.273s">She's</a>  going to be making not a great announcement, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4979.713s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot, just move your motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4981.594s">Is</a>  there a second to the item? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4983.435s">Seconded</a>  by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4985.016s">Did</a>  I miss you? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4986.377s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4987.517s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=4988.358s">And</a>  just with the heat in the gym, it's definitely, I don't know if they don't turn it on on the weekends, but I'm there for basketball games on the weekends and the gym is freezing. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5000.244s">Everyone</a>  has down coats on, people from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5004.116s">coming</a>  to the games, comment on it, so.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5006.337s">I</a>  was just there, like, what, a week ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5008.738s">We</a>  were both there, and we had coats off, and comfortable, but we'll have an audit done.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5013.761s">Yeah,</a>  that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5014.481s">We'll</a>  investigate it further. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5015.282s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5015.662s">Definitely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5016.022s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5017.683s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5018.363s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5019.024s">Mantello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5020.144s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5021.785s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5022.225s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5023.266s">All</a>  opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5024.266s">Motion</a>  is granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5026.948s">Report</a>  of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5029.329s">Madam?</a> </p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5037.434s">Good</a>  evening everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5039.494s">So</a>  last Thursday, prior to the winter high school orchestra concert, we enjoyed a wonderful event celebrating former school committee member Lina DiGentimasso. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5050.997s">The</a>  Medford High School Music Room was dedicated in her honor by Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5055.895s">Lena</a>  and her family could not have been more appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5059.497s">I</a>  would be remiss if I did not thank our Fine Arts Director, Tony Zigny, for his gracious assistance, and the Medford High School Orchestra for their wonderful musical selections. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5072.365s">I'd</a>  also like to recognize Principal Chad Fallon and the Culinary Arts Program for providing the pre-ceremony reception. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5081.631s">It</a>  was truly a collaborative effort between the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5085.828s">the</a>  city council to honor Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5089.25s">DeGenta</a>  Maso, who devoted a great part of her life to the Medford Public Schools and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5095.614s">The</a>  plaque is in place right now over the door of the music room in A building. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5101.338s">So</a>  I wanted to just recognize that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5104.0s">I</a>  also wanted to talk a little bit about CCSR. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5107.402s">Our</a>  CCSR students have been quite busy of late. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5112.085s">The</a>  Medford High School members have been visiting <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5115.845s">with</a>  students in both, the high school students have been visiting with our students at the elementary and middle school levels to discuss CCSR goals and objectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5127.107s">And</a>  they were assisted, again, by Rhetta Smith and the Garden Club in planting the new orchard that we do now have in place, and we'll hear a little bit more about that in detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5140.07s">And</a>  some of them are here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5142.951s">We</a>  had 10 pear trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5145.631s">planted,</a>  blackberries and raspberries were planted. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5149.332s">Not</a>  at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5150.212s">You'll</a>  come up a little later for a separate report. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5153.313s">And</a>  currently the CCSR are in the process of collecting toys for Tots. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5159.895s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5163.056s">Our</a>  Spanish II honors class at the high school, they have Skyped with students in Bolivia. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5171.758s">and</a>  our students were able to practice their conversational Spanish, while their students were able to practice conversational English, and our students truly enjoyed this learning experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5184.083s">This</a>  unique learning experience, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5187.104s">Hope</a>  Chest, so last week, the Medford High School Vocational School Hope Chest Food Pantry, Priscilla's Pantry, opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5197.269s">and</a>  the pantry is available for all students and is free of charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5202.05s">The</a>  pantry has shelf-stable foods and household goods. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5206.772s">It</a>  will be open Thursdays after school from 2.30 to 3.30 with the hopes of expanding operating hours in the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5215.914s">The</a>  pantry is located next to the third floor lecture hall in C building. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5221.196s">And</a>  I would like to thank the following who made Priscilla's Pantry possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5225.717s">the</a>  Hoff Family Foundation, the Greater Boston Food Bank, in partnership with the Malden YMCA, along with the district's nutritionist, Retta Smith, and teachers Annie Saulnier, Emily Polini, and John Wilson. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5243.481s">This</a>  is another great example of collaboration that benefits our students and families. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5250.903s">Empowering</a>  Girls Conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5253.268s">So</a>  on Wednesday, November 28th, a group of 8th grade students from the Andrews Middle School <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5260.831s">attended</a>  the Empowering Girls 2018 conference at the Cary Memorial Building in Lexington. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5267.495s">It</a>  was hosted by Middlesex DA, Marion Ryan, and the all-day program was designed for middle school girls with the theme of She Persisted. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5278.801s">The</a>  students and their chaperones, Katie Fumara, who's an adjustment Councilor, and Yvonne Santos, a guidance Councilor, were met with opening remarks from Marion Ryan. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5290.847s">who</a>  discussed the importance of persisting through difficulties and going after the career you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5297.692s">The</a>  Andrews students listened to guest speakers, asked questions, participated in activities, and left feeling empowered and invigorated about their futures. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5308.439s">Thanks</a>  to D.A. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5309.22s">Ryan,</a>  the Empowering Girls 2018 program, it ended up being a huge success, and the Andrews will definitely return next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5321.028s">On</a>  the sports venue, Medford High School and our vocational school combined, our winter sports season has officially begun. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5328.715s">And</a>  our La Conte ice rink is offering expanded public skating over the holiday break. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5336.862s">And</a>  all of that is listed on our website and our blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5341.503s">I</a>  continue to have a focus on looking at instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5345.727s">I</a>  am really trying to stick to my goal of being in schools at least twice a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5351.291s">And</a>  I am continuing to witness and observe instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5355.575s">Over</a>  the past two weeks, I have been at the Columbus, the Roberts, the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5361.539s">It's</a>  really uplifting to see how devoted our teachers are. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5365.662s">in</a>  terms of implementing their curriculum and really being focused on our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5371.903s">Additionally,</a>  earlier today I was at the Columbus and I was able to spend time with one of our math coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5378.905s">As</a>  you know, math is one of my goals and a serious focus of a lot of my instruction, although it's not exclusively mathematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5387.547s">And</a>  I was able to work with Ellie O'Leary today. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5391.247s">And</a>  I spent time with the fifth grade team at the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5395.228s">I</a>  had the opportunity to observe inclusion math and special education teacher Wendy Anderson was working collaboratively with the teacher, so it was wonderful to see inclusion at work and instruction happening and students focusing on math and having an opportunity to productively struggle. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5417.704s">and</a>  be challenged, but know it's for a good reason, a good cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5421.686s">So</a>  as I've been looking at instruction, I've had the opportunity to look at instruction with principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5428.191s">When</a>  I was at the Brooks, I got to walk this last time with the assistant principal and members of my leadership team, and I also go to schools independently, so just continuing to keep my eyes on instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5443.367s">Another</a>  important thing happening in the district right now is ACE advisors and coaches in education. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5450.675s">This</a>  past week, Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Principals Nick Tucci of the McGlynn Middle School and Michael Downs, Principal of the Andrews Middle School, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5461.603s">Assistant</a>  Principal David Blouk at the high school, as well as Penny Funiali and Lisa Bandonian, met to discuss the ACE project at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5473.61s">The</a>  ACE project, again, Advisors and Coaches in Education, is a project of the Medford Health Department, Team Medford, and Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5483.555s">The</a>  purpose of the ACE project is to educate and train club advisors and coaches on how to effectively build meaningful relationships with students through search institutes, evidence-based model for developmental relationships, which will help to reduce substance abuse and other risky behaviors in youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5506.483s">Medford</a>  High School already has ACE in place, so this is now moving down to the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5514.506s">on</a>  safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5515.87s">Our</a>  principals and administrators have been actively working together on upgrading our building security plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5523.348s">All</a>  schools-based principals, Officer Ziobro and John McLaughlin, we met in a closed-door meeting session to discuss our current security practices and measures and examining the Safe Havens reports from a district perspective of what things we can do to continue to keep Medford safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5544.995s">Additionally,</a>  last week, Officer Ziobro, Lieutenant Paul Covino, Principal Nick Tucci and Principal Brian Toomey, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5553.195s">They</a>  all attended safety workshops that were conducted by Safe Havens last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5559.779s">And</a>  they reported out on the workshops, and they shared with the principal group when we were discussing our security and safety plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5573.488s">MSBA,</a>  which is the Massachusetts School Building Authority, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5578.555s">The</a>  MSBA did announce at the end of last week that they awarded their award recipients. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5584.945s">They</a>  awarded 14 districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5587.168s">Unfortunately,</a>  at this time Medford was not selected this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5591.935s">However,</a>  we will continue to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5594.845s">for</a>  funding to renovate our high school complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5598.047s">In</a>  light of not being selected, we will continue to work collaboratively with the city for targeted capital improvement projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5606.391s">So</a>  it's something that we're gonna continue to work on and work at. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5612.473s">Another</a>  very important topic that has surfaced and the school committee members were requesting an update on vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5622.435s">And</a>  vaping is definitely a serious concern that the country is facing and Medford is not excluded from this challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5633.543s">We</a>  take this very seriously as a district and as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5639.145s">Our</a>  school administration is very aware of the public health issues and how it's affecting our students and the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5652.809s">Here</a>  is, I'm going to share just a few brief overview of steps that we've taken thus far and that we're going to continue to address the issue of vaping as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5663.923s">with</a>  a focus on the whole child. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5666.944s">We</a>  have engaged in specific student education around vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5671.245s">They</a>  are addressing it in some portions of the curriculum that we're using, the Michigan model. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5678.967s">Student</a>  support to assist students who are at risk and engaging in risky behaviors. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5685.009s">Community</a>  partnerships in collaboration with the Medford Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5691.451s">and</a>  frequent ongoing education and outreach for parents and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5696.174s">We</a>  are also looking into providing in collaboration with the city, providing like a parent support group that could be available to parents at the high school and offer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5712.242s">So</a>  those are some of the things that we're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5715.544s">So</a>  knowing that vaping is <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5718.105s">truly</a>  a serious concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5720.148s">I</a>  wanted to just put it on the floor that it is something that we are taking very seriously, but because this is truly a large issue, we did not have enough time to prepare a comprehensive report. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5734.873s">on</a>  specific numbers and statistics of things that are happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5738.056s">So</a>  we're in the process of combining that to come back to you in January to give you a more robust presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5747.185s">And</a>  we would like to, we are trying to ask Dr. Schuster <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5752.31s">and</a>  Team Medford from the Department of Public Health to come and share their wealth of knowledge with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5759.254s">So</a>  I'm shooting for the second meeting in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5762.516s">Dr.</a>  Schuster has already conducted professional development with members of Team Medford at the high school to all school leaders and <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5773.283s">director-level</a>  administrators, and that was a very, very informative training, a lot of positive feedback, and they would like her to come back, and we would like her to also be able to come and present as an expert in the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5789.009s">So</a>  that is where we are with our work around vaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5793.732s">On</a>  another note, I wanted to just say today I had the pleasure of being at the Roberts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5800.375s">I</a>  was invited to see their hand chimes concert. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5807.178s">And</a>  their music instructor, Mr. Jim Connors, is truly masterful. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5811.821s">Our</a>  arts department as a district is phenomenal. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5815.844s">And</a>  today was another special treat by fourth and fifth graders. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5821.007s">They</a>  played the hand chimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5822.888s">In</a>  addition to that, musical pieces, drums, xylophones, recorders. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5829.673s">And</a>  I saw for the first time today <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5833.655s">tenor</a>  recorder and a bass recorder, I had not seen them. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=5838.037s">So</a>  students were not only playing

    <p>[Kaylee Boulay]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6066.903s">Hi,</a>  so I'm Kaylee Boulay, and on Friday, December 7th, we had the opportunity to plant 10 Asian pear trees, 10 blackberry bushes, and 10 raspberry bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6078.87s">I,</a>  now a sophomore in Medford High, along with sophomores for B.D. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6082.832s">Rana,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6086.049s">Emily</a>  Gotti, and Jenna Matarazzo, with assistance from sophomore biology students, Dorven Edward, Enrique Ramos, Gabriela Paz-Luiz, and Jose Avelar Serrano, were able to join in in the planting. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6103.418s">We,</a>  the students, planted three of the ten trees and all ten blackberry bushes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6108.42s">We</a>  all enjoyed being outside, and despite the cold, working in the sunshine was surprisingly pleasant. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6114.673s">We</a>  hope to continue the project in the spring by creating a simple, low-cost outdoor classroom space so that teachers will be able to hold class in the space if they like. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6124.799s">Tufts</a>  College students are working on lesson plans that meet Massachusetts learning standards that teachers of various disciplines can utilize to integrate the Orchard with their class of desire. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6135.805s">The</a>  project was partially funded by CCSR and the Cummings Grant.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6182.068s">Now</a>  that we have a bear in the midst, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6184.85s">That</a>  was part of the reason, because we could better <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6190.175s">you</a>  know, confine what we needed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6191.957s">We</a>  were worried about rodents and small animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6195.061s">And</a>  if we put it outside on the field, the kids practice and play on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6199.688s">And</a>  there's another area where younger children play. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6202.469s">So</a>  this seemed like the perfect place for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6205.349s">I</a>  think it's a great idea.</p>

    <p>[Diane Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6436.426s">The</a>  Medford Public School has been named to the ninth annual AP District Honor Roll, which recognizes schools that increase access to and performance on advanced placement programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6449.093s">Only</a>  373 school districts around the United States and Canada were selected for this honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6455.257s">The</a>  AP District Honor Roll is administered by the Advanced Placement Program, which enables willing and academically prepared students to pursue college-level studies while still in high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6467.881s">The</a>  program consists of college-level courses developed by the AP program that high schools can choose to offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6475.404s">Corresponding</a>  exams are administered once a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6479.165s">The</a>  AP District Honor Roll recognizes schools that are committed to increasing access to AP <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6485.207s">for</a>  underrepresented students while simultaneously maintaining or increasing the percentage of students earning AP exam scores of 3 or higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6495.732s">The</a>  distinction of being named to this honor roll means Medford is committed to expanding the availability of AP courses among prepared and motivated students of all backgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6507.786s">Medford</a>  High School has increased the number of students participating in advanced placement courses over the past three years, while also increasing or maintaining the percentage of students earning scores of three or higher on AP exams. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6527.258s">Per</a>  the college board, reaching these goals shows that Medford is to successfully motivating and academically, thank you, preparing students who are ready for AP. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6537.82s">Medford</a>  was one of 19 total schools recognized in Massachusetts, which included Brookline, Natick, Newburyport, Pembroke, Linfield, Shrewsbury, Mattapoisette, Norwell, Menden, Marshfield, Lunenburg, South Deerfield, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6553.463s">Ternus</a>  Falls, Belchertown, Kingston, South Hadley, and Westborough. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6558.227s">And</a>  as you know, in the state of Massachusetts, we have approximately 354 districts right here in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6566.634s">So</a>  this is quite an honor for Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6568.956s">Wonderful.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6572.839s">Very</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6573.319s">There's</a>  a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6577.463s">Van</a>  der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6578.984s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6579.584s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6580.205s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6580.845s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6582.823s">Item</a>  five, recommendation to approve FOSS science curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6586.886s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6587.207s">Patterson.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6588.808s">So</a>  this is just a revisit to the original approval back on October 1st, but it was important to make sure that everybody understood the cost impact of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6599.937s">It</a>  has increased based on the number of required items needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6605.061s">So</a>  the new timeline that we have been negotiating with the company is a three-year payment term. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6612.182s">We</a>  did get, we're still fine tuning the legal terminology within the contract, but year one would be $139,326. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6618.585s">Year</a>  two and three would be $69,663. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6619.525s">So</a>  that would provide us the opportunity to begin the training, get the materials now to roll this out for fiscal year 19-20. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6623.167s">So</a>  the revised quote came in at $278,652. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6641.811s">which</a>  we are requesting to proceed and recommend this additional amount.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6649.373s">So</a>  moved by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6650.873s">Is</a>  there a second by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6652.033s">Kreatz?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6652.613s">Roll</a>  call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6653.754s">Mr.</a>  Russo has a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6655.674s">Mr.</a>  Russo.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6657.654s">What</a>  does SRB option mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6659.755s">I</a>  see it mentioned a few times. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6663.436s">It's</a>  on page 103 on the right under bonus, then there's requires SRB option. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6671.628s">It's</a>  not so obvious today.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6674.911s">Are</a>  you referring to just the shipping costs? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6678.794s">Requires</a>  SRB option. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6683.759s">So</a>  that would be something that Rocco Sieri would have identified as needed for the components. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6690.585s">So</a>  the complete kits, the teacher materials, <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6693.438s">the</a>  living materials, and the miscellaneous items. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6696.559s">So</a>  that would be all inclusive of what the packet would entail. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6701.28s">I</a>  apologize, I don't know the science acronym for that particular area.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6706.182s">I'll</a>  get it later.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6707.682s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6707.922s">Mustone.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6714.664s">The</a>  intent is that they will be shipped out for the spring for training. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6719.139s">This</a>  spring?</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6719.979s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6720.26s">Great,</a>  so full rollout September 2019.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6722.54s">Yes,</a>  full rollout.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6759.462s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6759.722s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6765.725s">Under</a>  New Business, School Committee Resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6768.526s">Mayor</a>  Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6769.447s">Mr.</a>  Rousseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6772.34s">I</a>  would like to ask a question perhaps of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6776.781s">Patterson</a>  about our MSBA application. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6782.462s">Oh,</a>  sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6783.582s">Do</a>  we get feedback or do they just simply give us a no? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6788.983s">Like</a>  is there something about our application they dislike or think that we can do differently?</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6793.284s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6793.844s">I</a>  did call MSBA directly and inquired if there was something <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6801.205s">terminology</a>  that could be more aggressive or make us more needy in that context. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6806.75s">The</a>  short answer is no, that each year it's a new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6810.594s">There</a>  are districts that have been filing since 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6813.897s">It</a>  just is a matter of the significant need based on enrollment factors and the conditions of the building of whichever project that they are looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6824.563s">Again,</a>  the core projects, core projects alone were over 70 projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6829.044s">So</a>  only a small amount based on the amount of funding per the state is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6835.526s">There</a>  are accelerated projects that are available, but again, those are for roof, boiler, and windows only. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6843.809s">So</a>  that is something to explore down the road, but again, we keep our... <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6849.147s">capital</a>  improvement listing, and we can certainly update it and address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6853.091s">We</a>  did fine tune it based on the merger of the vocational and high school this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6857.855s">We</a>  will, again, go out for the application period that opens at the end of January. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6863.661s">Submissions</a>  typically go in for February, March, and April.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6869.299s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6869.579s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6872.022s">Yes,</a>  just one question on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6873.684s">One</a>  of the concerns that was brought to us is the heating in the gym, and I've always been concerned about the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6881.092s">Have</a>  we included those in our submission? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6884.376s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6886.458s">And</a>  again, that's the core program.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6889.06s">That</a>  wasn't a separate application just for the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6891.802s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6892.462s">So</a>  we have to look.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6893.783s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6894.143s">And</a>  the heating is really infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6897.846s">It's</a>  the HVAC system. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6899.327s">So</a>  that is a significant cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6902.088s">So</a>  we're going to be looking at that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6904.41s">We</a>  do have new boilers that we put in three, four years ago.</p>

    <p>[Kirsteen Patterson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6906.471s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6907.232s">Not</a>  the boilers. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6908.573s">Yeah,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6910.474s">The</a>  handlers and all those other gadgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6914.857s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6915.057s">Bustone.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6916.046s">Any</a>  of the 14 school districts that were funded? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6918.967s">The</a>  12 will be listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6921.187s">They</a>  will? <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6921.607s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/R49wqTZ5YIg&t=6922.187s">Okay.</a> </p>
