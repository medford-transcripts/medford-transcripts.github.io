00:33:26,937 --> 00:33:27,698
Thank you everyone.

49
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:40,689
What a beautiful night to come to this illustrious chamber to hear the beautiful music being played, and at this time we would like to welcome the String Orchestra of Medford High School, led by Mr. Tony Zigny, to play a few more songs for us.

50
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:49,199
That's in Bedford Square.

51
00:33:49,219 --> 00:34:00,392
It used to sit in Simpsons Tavern back in the 1800s where James Spear Blanche sat down with his cup of coffee and composed Jingle Bells right here.

52
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:22,632
And I'd like to wish everybody a safe and happy New Year's holiday season.

53
00:36:29,721 --> 00:36:35,142
Thank you so much Mr. Zigney and to the members of the string ensemble here with us tonight.

54
00:36:35,963 --> 00:36:51,166
This morning I woke up and I was thinking about my day and I'm thinking okay gotta do this gotta do this and I'm thinking oh yeah school committee meeting tonight and then I thought oh and we're gonna hear music tonight and they're going to be with us and it just made my day so much better knowing you were gonna be here tonight.

55
00:36:51,306 --> 00:36:53,246
Thank you so much we really appreciate it.

56
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:00,032
Ms.

57
00:37:00,072 --> 00:37:02,053
Kretz, did you want to say a few words?

58
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,994
Yes, I want to say thank you very much.

59
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,094
You sounded beautiful.

60
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:09,336
I know you were here very early setting up and practicing, and I could hear you the whole time.

61
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:10,576
It just sounds amazing.

62
00:37:10,956 --> 00:37:11,897
Thank you very much.

63
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:12,177
Thank you.

64
00:37:13,157 --> 00:37:13,617
Wonderful.

65
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:15,278
Mr. Ruggiero.

66
00:37:16,018 --> 00:37:18,399
Oh, it was really quite wonderful.

67
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:24,321
My son's learning violin right now, and so I was thinking of, I hope he has a chance to get as good as you guys.

68
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:26,822
Thank you so much.

69
00:37:27,142 --> 00:37:27,862
Mr. Benedetto.

70
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:28,703
Thank you.

71
00:37:30,163 --> 00:37:31,364
This is my favorite night.

72
00:37:31,424 --> 00:37:41,712
When we sat on meetings with beautiful music and all of you donating your time to play for us and the community, just really puts a big smile on my face.

73
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:53,842
I love to hear you all play, and it's especially important to me because this is one of the few times that we get to hear Mr. Zigny play as well, and he's not just conducting.

74
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:59,767
So when I open the door and I heard the music, the minute you open the door, it goes all the way through City Hall.

75
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:02,599
It just puts a big smile on everybody's face.

76
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,680
And thank you for your time.

77
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,944
And thank you for the parents for bringing your children here and sharing their talent with us.

78
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:14,689
We appreciate it.

79
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:15,430
Thank you so much.

80
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,051
And Happy New Year to all of you as well.

81
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:18,032
Happy holidays.

82
00:38:22,183 --> 00:38:24,725
I know, my son just bought one of those, full suit.

83
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:27,466
For Christmas, yeah.

84
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:29,528
Thank you.

85
00:38:37,573 --> 00:38:41,655
Next up, we have the approval of the minutes of the December 3rd, 2018 meeting.

86
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:42,556
Mr. Benedetto.

87
00:38:42,576 --> 00:38:48,580
When I was looking through the minutes, I noticed that

88
00:38:50,768 --> 00:39:03,311
Towards the back, we were talking about the 5013Cs and how the superintendent assigned her new executive assistant, Emily, to work that.

89
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:16,295
I was wondering if we could add to that, and I don't know if it's allowed, to just give us a report at the end of February to just see how it's going and making sure she's not overwhelmed and, you know, just a little add-on.

90
00:39:17,703 --> 00:39:18,363
if you don't mind.

91
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:18,903
And motion to approve.

92
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:25,025
So you're requesting a report by the end of February on the status of the friends of all the groups that are filled with extra high school.

93
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:29,746
Yeah, like who registered, how many left, and how much work it actually takes for our staff.

94
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:35,327
Motion to second the minutes as amended by Mr. Benedetto, by Mr. Russo.

95
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:35,727

00:39:38,308 --> 00:39:38,368
Aye.

99
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:39,808
All those opposed?

100
00:39:39,828 --> 00:39:40,268
Thank you.

101
00:39:40,468 --> 00:39:41,248
Motion passes.

102
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:43,969

103
00:39:45,878 --> 00:39:46,798
Motion for approval by Ms.

104
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:47,959
Van de Kloet, is there a second?

105
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:50,400
Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

106
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,721
Mayor Burke, I just had a quick question.

107
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:53,161
Mr. Benedetto.

108
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:55,022
Of course, right?

109
00:39:56,423 --> 00:40:07,168
Actually, it's on page 14 of 24, school committee dues, $247.98 to one member.

110
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:11,990
I'm assuming it's for the conference, but I just want to make sure.

111
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:15,917
14 of 24, halfway down.

112
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,841
The amount is $247.98.

113
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:19,841
$247.98?

114
00:40:20,181 --> 00:40:25,526
Yes.

115
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:28,669
OK.

116
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,011
Thank you.

117
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:30,171
Ms.

118
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:31,712

119
00:40:31,752 --> 00:40:33,534
I don't know if you had a chance to look at it.

120
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:34,455
I apologize.

121
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,616

Report of Secretary.

140
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:53,630
Okay, so last week I signed off on an invoice for, it sounds like a very exciting program that took place over the summer.

141
00:41:54,470 --> 00:42:09,794
Miranda Wilson from the Miffitt Transcript, she taught the students, the CCSR students, she led a journalism workshop for students at Miffitt High School in August, and the students completed the project of writing and publishing a newspaper article.

142
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:14,915
I thought it was so interesting and I thought it was great, something that they were doing in the summer that was educational

143
00:42:15,529 --> 00:42:17,150
I just wanted to share with everybody.

144
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,910
Thank you.

145
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,350
Thank you.

00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,452
Motion to receive and place on file, the report of the Secretary, seconded by Mr. Russo.

147
00:42:23,472 --> 00:42:24,232

00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:24,853
Aye.

149
00:42:24,893 --> 00:42:25,493
All those opposed?

150
00:42:25,533 --> 00:42:26,213
Motion passes.

151
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:27,714
Report of Committees.

152
00:42:27,774 --> 00:42:30,155
First item, Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee, November 29, 2018.

153
00:42:30,295 --> 00:42:30,435
Ms.

154
00:42:30,475 --> 00:42:30,715
Mustone.

155
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:31,195
Good evening, everyone.

156
00:42:36,684 --> 00:42:38,225
So I will try to bring the highlights.

157
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:41,908
We did have a follow-up buildings and grounds subcommittee meeting on November 29th.

158
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:50,794
It was a follow-up from our meeting last May to hear about updates in security and safety at the high school.

159
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:55,498
So present were four school committee members, the superintendent,

160
00:42:55,897 --> 00:42:59,778
two parents of both elementary and high school age students.

161
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:05,920
We had three Medford police officers, Lieutenant Covino, Officer Ziobro, and Officer Lokowitz.

162
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:13,903
The director of buildings and grounds was in attendance, director of nursing, the high school principal, and the assistant superintendent, Miss Patterson.

163
00:43:14,483 --> 00:43:19,124
So we had a good representation of everyone at the high school building.

164
00:43:20,144 --> 00:43:24,966
First item that Officer Ziobro shared with us is that he does attend

165
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:33,565
monthly meetings with the community-based justice coalition with the assistant district attorney.

166
00:43:34,185 --> 00:43:46,228
The director of nursing, Tony Ray, also attends, and it's to address high-level risk situations and highly troubled students that they are paying attention to.

167
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:53,463
Second was the safe haven report at that time was not released to the public.

168
00:43:54,184 --> 00:43:59,888
It was understood that it is a Department of Homeland Security document and it is a privileged document.

169
00:44:01,283 --> 00:44:04,987
Parts that can be shared will be shared when it is available.

170
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:10,932
Third was all the cameras have been fixed or are currently being fixed.

171
00:44:11,212 --> 00:44:17,537
So all the cameras in all of the school buildings are fixed or are on a list to be fixed happening currently.

172
00:44:18,438 --> 00:44:20,420
Next, oh, some question was asked.

173
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:26,465
There are 95 cameras on the high school campus, and it is privileged information where they are.

174
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:33,676
The other concern parents had was the doors being marked from the outside of the school buildings.

175
00:44:34,376 --> 00:44:42,280
Currently, there are doors that were unmarked that are now being marked by Mr. McLaughlin.

176
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:51,745
The next highlight was that Mr. DeLava shared that on November 6, there was a training about safety care for kids in crisis.

177
00:44:52,305 --> 00:44:55,467
He wanted to thank the Medford Police Department for their continuing

178
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,576
training and building relationships with students.

179
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:11,721
Mr. DeLeva also shared that dogs from area police departments and the state police came to do some training in the building, both for drugs and ballistics.

180
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:20,304
We did learn that different dogs are trained for specific sins, differing between drug paraphernalia and ballistics.

181
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:32,260
We did, after the safety update, we did discuss the feminine hygiene products being installed in the high school, and that will be in a follow-up report with Ms.

182
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,181
Diane Caldwell.

183
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:41,471
I don't know if my fellow members, Erin and, I mean, Committee Member DiVenedetto and Committee Member Kretz are both on the

184
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:47,612
buildings and grout subcommittee and committee member Van de Kloot was in attendance and that is all I have to share.

185
00:45:47,772 --> 00:45:48,212
Thank you, Mayor.

186
00:45:48,232 --> 00:45:50,394
Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman.

187
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,496
Are there any other comments on this report?

188
00:45:54,297 --> 00:45:54,938
Mr. Russo.

189
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:57,380
Thank you very much.

190
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:04,826
Will the response to the sanitary materials and bathrooms, which I don't think that's actually on the agenda, is it?

191
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:07,889
So maybe we should discuss it.

192
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:07,989
Ms.

193
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:08,729
Caldwell.

194
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:10,511
Good evening.

195
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:14,999
So Mr. Russo, I'd like to thank you for bringing this to our attention earlier.

196
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:23,566
And we have worked with some CCSR members to make sure that we have been responsive to the needs of our girls.

197
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:32,153
So Director Tony Ray, who's our supervisor of nurses, and Director John McLaughlin of our buildings and grounds and I

198
00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:38,144
got together to resolve the concerns around sanitary products in our ladies' restrooms.

199
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:48,070
It was decided that we will order five product dispensers that are coin-free and place them in the bathrooms

200
00:46:48,496 --> 00:46:49,958
in the following locations.

201
00:46:50,499 --> 00:46:59,230
So if you're in C building on floors 1, 2, and 3, they will be in the bathrooms outside of C building.

202
00:47:00,011 --> 00:47:04,998
We will also put a dispenser in the vocational school on the second floor.

203
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:09,739
and we thought it might be wise to have one in the girls' gym area as well.

204
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:13,380
These products will be free to our students.

205
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,900
Buildings and grounds will supply and fill the dispensers.

206
00:47:17,581 --> 00:47:27,423
The estimated cost for the dispensers of these products will be around $1,100, but then after I got the quotes from John McLaughlin, it comes to about $950.

207
00:47:30,143 --> 00:47:34,526
Students can still go to the nurse's office if they're by the nurse's office on the second floor.

208
00:47:34,546 --> 00:47:42,670
And I know there's some question about whether we can fill them with tampons, but according to Director Ray, we cannot do that.

209
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,873
But I'm happy to announce at least we can get free products for our girls in the ladies' rooms.

210
00:47:48,593 --> 00:47:50,174
I'm happy to answer any questions.

211
00:47:50,374 --> 00:47:50,994
Mr. Russo.

212
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,235
Thank you very much.

213
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:53,296
This is a lot of progress.

214
00:47:53,376 --> 00:47:54,616
I really do appreciate that.

215
00:47:56,572 --> 00:47:59,933
Is Miss Ray here now?

216
00:48:00,333 --> 00:48:01,573
She is not.

217
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:03,373
She says that we cannot.

218
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:17,136
But in New York State, they have a law that went into effect on July 1, mandating that from sixth through 12th grade, every single bathroom have both pads and tampons for free in every public school in their state.

219
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:22,157
So we're a long way from that.

220
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:28,215
And I'm hopeful that my work with the legislature to make this the law in Massachusetts soon will happen.

221
00:48:29,175 --> 00:48:39,904
I'm just wondering if we do some of what we're planning and then the legislature says we have to do effectively the same thing, will we be able to reuse what we've already done or will we have to start over?

222
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:42,106
I don't believe we'd have to start over.

223
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:44,929
We can look at what we've done and I think can move forward with that.

224
00:48:45,189 --> 00:48:45,669
Okay.

225
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,751
I mean, so is there a change to the

226
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:51,014
It says it's outside the assistant principal's office.

227
00:48:51,315 --> 00:48:53,196
Well, that's just the location.

228
00:48:53,236 --> 00:48:56,539
It's right outside the assistant principal's office, but it's in the ladies' rooms.

229
00:48:56,939 --> 00:48:58,240
Oh, see, that's not clear.

230
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,002
It looked like it was in the hall.

231
00:49:00,102 --> 00:49:00,382
No.

232
00:49:00,742 --> 00:49:02,624
I'm like, this is not making sense.

233
00:49:03,965 --> 00:49:09,409
And how long does it take from the furthest point on building on 1, 2, or 3?

234
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:15,707
What is the furthest distance to walk to one of these within the school?

235
00:49:15,727 --> 00:49:16,167
A building.

236
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:19,810
I guess it depends how quickly you walk.

237
00:49:19,870 --> 00:49:21,091
But I really don't think it's a long distance.

238
00:49:21,131 --> 00:49:22,331
Well, let's say you need one of these urgently.

239
00:49:22,351 --> 00:49:24,493
You're probably not running.

240
00:49:25,033 --> 00:49:26,774
It's a few minutes, I would reckon.

241
00:49:26,814 --> 00:49:27,435
It's about a few minutes.

242
00:49:27,475 --> 00:49:28,776
Because I still get lost at the high school.

243
00:49:28,816 --> 00:49:33,018
So to me, it's like a 25-minute walk to try and figure it out.

244
00:49:33,078 --> 00:49:33,399
OK, good.

245
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:34,179
That's good.

246
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:34,880
A couple minutes.

247
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,180
It's just a couple minutes.

248
00:49:36,481 --> 00:49:37,861
All right, that's important.

249
00:49:37,881 --> 00:49:38,182
All right.

250
00:49:39,915 --> 00:49:48,983
So I guess I would really like to hear a follow-up as to why tampons cannot... I mean, the dispensers themselves may not be capable of it, and so that is an issue if we need to pick a different dispenser.

251
00:49:49,503 --> 00:49:57,150
But I mean, it seems like we're making a decision for girls whether they can use pads or tampons.

252
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:02,108
I'm already having that conversation with the fifth graders.

253
00:50:02,188 --> 00:50:05,790
So I don't think this is really a decision for the school system to decide.

254
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:07,812
I would have to speak to Ms.

255
00:50:07,852 --> 00:50:08,512
Ray about that.

256
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:10,193
I think she knows more about it than I do.

257
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:12,555
But we can have a follow-up conversation with her.

258
00:50:12,915 --> 00:50:13,156
OK.

259
00:50:15,257 --> 00:50:17,118
This is a possible answer.

260
00:50:17,138 --> 00:50:17,178
Ms.

261
00:50:17,198 --> 00:50:17,759
Mustone.

262
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:19,520
I don't know the answer.

263
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:29,067
The only thing I could think of is maybe it's possible that because of toxic shock syndrome, that it's not something that the school feels comfortable, because then you'd be liable, God forbid,

264
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:36,843
someone came with toxic shock syndrome.

265
00:50:37,684 --> 00:50:51,290
I feel like one of the least qualified people around this space to talk about this, but I had to learn about toxic shock syndrome in the little books that I had to read for my own child.

266
00:50:52,157 --> 00:50:54,758
It's the frequency of changing them that is important.

267
00:50:54,898 --> 00:50:59,460
So not having them seems like we're setting ourselves up for a liability versus having them.

268
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:10,024
So I don't really follow the logic that not having them is better because we just want to pretend nothing's going on.

269
00:51:10,244 --> 00:51:15,526
If we're putting the pads in there, then we are saying that we care about this issue.

270
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:20,928
And if you make the decision as a girl to use tampons,

271
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:22,979
Well, that's not our problem.

272
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:24,641
And I just think that's not OK.

273
00:51:24,661 --> 00:51:27,544
I think she's going to check with the nursing department to see what's legal in masks.

274
00:51:27,565 --> 00:51:27,965
I'll do that.

275
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:28,706
I'll follow up.

276
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:29,908
Maybe we're different than New York.

277
00:51:29,928 --> 00:51:30,168
I don't know.

278
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:33,044
Ms.

279
00:51:33,144 --> 00:51:33,865
Vander Kloot is next.

280
00:51:35,406 --> 00:51:36,987
I think we need you to check into that.

281
00:51:37,108 --> 00:51:43,333
We received an email just before the meeting tonight asking us why we were not providing both.

282
00:51:44,314 --> 00:51:48,417
It seemed to be well thought out and certainly convincing.

283
00:51:49,618 --> 00:51:51,159
And if the machine doesn't

284
00:51:52,697 --> 00:51:59,185
support, there's always a little basket or something that we might be able to provide.

285
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:01,668
So if you would get back to us on that.

286
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:07,355
On the other hand, as you said, Paul, we're making progress, and I'm glad that we are.

287
00:52:07,656 --> 00:52:09,818
And I certainly think the initial

288
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:17,846
And I think the disbursement of in the locations that you described should say, let's see how it goes.

289
00:52:17,906 --> 00:52:26,673
But our objective should be to provide the supplies throughout the entire schools.

290
00:52:28,235 --> 00:52:29,976
You mean for middle schools as well?

291
00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:32,078
I think we'll start here.

292
00:52:32,338 --> 00:52:34,580
And I think in a short time we need to evaluate it.

293
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,362
And, you know, I think that's our objective.

294
00:52:38,382 --> 00:52:40,983
My objective, now that it's been raised to us, it makes a lot of sense.

295
00:52:41,063 --> 00:52:48,227
So anyway, if you would get back to us on that question, and we'll... Point of information, Ms.

296
00:52:48,267 --> 00:52:48,707
Mustone?

297
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:53,469
Jonathan just shared that the current dispensers have dual capacity.

298
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:58,171
So if the time comes that you need to dispense dual products, you can.

299
00:52:58,571 --> 00:52:58,972
Very good.

300
00:52:59,212 --> 00:52:59,432
Thank you.

301
00:52:59,452 --> 00:53:02,833
Thank you.

302
00:53:02,873 --> 00:53:03,354
Mr. Benedetto?

303
00:53:04,825 --> 00:53:09,829
I make a motion to accept this as is and revisit it in January and ask Ms.

304
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:16,435
Ray to report on additional adding of other options for our students.

305
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:25,062
On the motion to accept this report as amended with a request for a follow-up on the status of t-cons in these machines.

306
00:53:25,623 --> 00:53:26,624
Is there a second, Mr. Russo?

307
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:26,844
Second.

308
00:53:27,765 --> 00:53:28,385
All those in favor?

309
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:28,465
Aye.

310
00:53:29,246 --> 00:53:29,946
All those opposed?

311
00:53:30,367 --> 00:53:30,987
Motion passes.

312
00:53:32,798 --> 00:53:35,700
The Rules Subcommittee, December 3rd, 2018.

313
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:35,940
Ms.

314
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:36,941
Kretz, chairwoman.

315
00:53:42,445 --> 00:53:46,848
And we discussed the final draft copy function of the school committee.

316
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:51,031
We were struggling with one of the functions, number five.

317
00:53:51,712 --> 00:54:01,359
So between our last meeting and this meeting, I went in and I met with city solicitor Mark Rumley,

318
00:54:02,321 --> 00:54:13,068
to get some help with him on the wording of what the possible consequences could be for a school committee member who was in violation of one of the policies.

319
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:25,797
So we reviewed the draft together and I came up with the new number five, which I put a copy in front of each of your tables this evening due to the last minute meeting that we had.

320
00:54:26,379 --> 00:54:32,824
We also had another meeting this evening from 6 to 618 p.m.

321
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:50,860
so that we could vote on the new final draft, including the updates to number five, and also including some different wording because we want to make sure that we weren't in violation with the law or the First Amendment.

322
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,923
So what you have in front of you right now is what was

323
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:03,903
looked at by City Solicitor Mark Rumley, and he said that the way it reads right now, we are in violation with the law in the First Amendment.

324
00:55:05,104 --> 00:55:23,651
So if everybody was in agreement with it, what we could do is we could, you know, ask maybe if we could put it on school letterhead, and then we could sign it at one of the future meetings, if there's something that you want to see in it differently, or if you have an idea that you wanted to see in it,

325
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:25,733
You know, we'd be happy to hear from you.

326
00:55:30,116 --> 00:55:33,918
Is there a motion to send this to Committee of the Whole, or do you want to send it to the floor?

327
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:42,704
Actually, if we talked about it this evening, and we feel like it's ready to go to the floor,

328
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:51,898
if everybody's okay with the way, it's supposed to be the key functions of the school committee, not the policies.

329
00:55:52,258 --> 00:55:56,080
So it's not a listing of everything that we do on school committee.

330
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:03,163
It's the key components.

331
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:11,746
So I'm not sure if you want to have a committee of the whole, that is something that we could do and we could talk about it

332
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:14,592
some time in January or February.

333
00:56:14,612 --> 00:56:21,177
If, you know, if this evening, if everybody's reviewed it over the last couple, I think you've got to draft another time.

334
00:56:21,597 --> 00:56:29,183
We did take out some language that wasn't legal or was in, it was in violation with the First Amendment.

335
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:40,632
So that's why, you know, if we were going to add anything else, we'd want to have either cities or both city solicitor Mark Marmoley and Howard Greenspan review it just to make sure we are, you know,

336
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:45,040
legally incompliant before we put anything on our website and sign it.

337
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,181
Ms.

338
00:56:47,201 --> 00:56:47,781
DiBenedetto.

339
00:56:48,941 --> 00:56:52,763
So I have to say I don't love number five.

340
00:56:52,883 --> 00:57:00,566
If a school committee member acts in a fashion that is unbecoming, may be subject to censure by two-thirds of the vote of the body.

341
00:57:00,847 --> 00:57:02,507
Well, what items are unbecoming?

342
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:03,668
Who decides that?

343
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:06,569
Like, that just can be anything.

344
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:08,610
And censure.

345
00:57:09,623 --> 00:57:11,784
I don't report to my fellow members.

346
00:57:11,864 --> 00:57:17,406
I report to the people who voted for me to be their voice at this seat.

347
00:57:18,106 --> 00:57:25,048
And so I would pull off item five totally.

348
00:57:25,568 --> 00:57:30,630
And I wouldn't sign off on this document with that on there.

349
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:35,311
And I think people would have a hard time censoring me anyway.

350
00:57:36,232 --> 00:57:36,612
Good luck.

351
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,762
because that's my job as a committee member is to speak my mind for the people who are elected me.

352
00:57:46,183 --> 00:58:02,250
And if other people get a right to censor what I say or find that what I say is unbecoming because they don't like it for any way, shape, or form, or my attitude, or the way that I might present it, or how passionate I am about an issue, I think is very dangerous to put in here.

353
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:07,593
And I think it would be so impossible to regulate

354
00:58:08,204 --> 00:58:10,887
Because I think you know me for eight years.

355
00:58:11,107 --> 00:58:12,369
I'm hot enough to regulate.

356
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:16,413
It's just not going to work.

357
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:17,714
Mr. Ruggiero.

358
00:58:19,276 --> 00:58:23,240
We spent a lot of time thinking about the idea of consequences and what the consequences are.

359
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,002
And this is something we debated back and forth.

360
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:30,215
According to Robert's Rules of Order, we have the authority now, whether we sign the document or not.

361
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:36,477
And what is activity on becoming a member is actually a subjective element.

362
00:58:37,878 --> 00:58:47,501
The idea, though, is censure has, you are ultimately responsible to the members of Medford, and the citizens of Medford.

363
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:54,584
So what you say is not, while we can censor you, it's what your authority is to the people of Medford.

364
00:58:55,207 --> 00:59:01,429
So, I mean, the idea, we wanted to add some element that we debated this idea back and forth quite a bit.

365
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:12,613
Ultimately, we came down on the idea that there should be some sort of provision for a member that we felt acts in violation with the things that we're signing.

366
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:14,234
Otherwise, it's just a piece of paper.

367
00:59:14,854 --> 00:59:21,056
And I think in the sessions that we had over the last several months with our association of school committees, they spoke about

368
00:59:21,805 --> 00:59:26,287
setting up guidelines for behavior, not behavior, but in what our role really is.

369
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:32,008
And what are we trying to deliver to the school students of our community?

370
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:38,971
And I didn't see it more as how we were acting, but if we were going astray to bring us back into what our role is.

371
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:43,972
So censure to me is a very harsh word, but I do recall her saying that.

372
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:49,914
And I guess I'd be interested in seeing some examples from other communities that she had given to you all.

373
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:52,355
Ms.

374
00:59:52,375 --> 00:59:52,976
Superintendent.

375
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,077
Thank you.

376
00:59:54,797 --> 01:00:00,982
And these five rules were based upon the samples that other districts are currently using.

377
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:06,226
So it was kind of like a potpourri, but the language that was removed.

378
01:00:08,728 --> 01:00:14,113
Mark Rumley said, you know, the pieces that needed to be removed were removed.

379
01:00:14,353 --> 01:00:17,856
But again, there's always a possibility of doing a committee of the whole.

380
01:00:19,177 --> 01:00:21,279
And we can also revisit this in another retreat

381
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:29,172
Dorothy Presser, also talking about norms and rules of engagement, going deeper with that.

382
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:36,760
Can I make a recommendation that someone send it to Committee of the Whole so that we can deliberate it and there's other things that have to get done this night?

383
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:42,392
Okay, motion to send to Committee of the Whole, offered by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Ms.

384
01:00:42,532 --> 01:00:42,772
Kretz.

385
01:00:42,812 --> 01:00:44,253
Before I call the roll, Ms.

386
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:44,713
Van de Kloot.

387
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:50,656
Yes, before you call the roll, there's just one other sentence that I wish the committee to look at, because I kept on reading it and kept on reading it.

388
01:00:50,676 --> 01:00:52,656
Well, it's going to be in Committee of the Whole now, so we can all look at it collectively.

389
01:00:52,676 --> 01:00:54,057
Oh, it's going to go to Committee of the Whole?

390
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:54,337
Yes.

391
01:00:54,377 --> 01:00:54,637
Okay.

392
01:00:55,058 --> 01:00:56,358
If it gets voted on to go there.

393
01:00:57,218 --> 01:00:58,079
I'll second.

394
01:00:58,099 --> 01:00:58,199
Okay.

395
01:00:59,634 --> 01:01:00,434
Roll call vote, please.

396
01:01:00,514 --> 01:01:01,715
Send this paper to Committee of the Whole.

397
01:01:01,995 --> 01:01:03,235
Mrs. DeVantage, yes.

398
01:01:03,675 --> 01:01:05,016
Mrs. Graves, yes.

399
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:05,796
Mrs. Stone, no.

400
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:07,176
Mr. Regano, yes.

401
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,217
Mrs. Chew, yes.

402
01:01:08,237 --> 01:01:10,497
Mrs. Vanderbilt, yes.

403
01:01:10,657 --> 01:01:12,578
Mrs. Vanderbilt, yes.

404
01:01:12,938 --> 01:01:14,499
I believe Mrs. Stone was a yes or no.

405
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:15,199
No, I was a yes.

406
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,059
You were a yes.

407
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:17,540
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

408
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:18,320
Motion passes.

409
01:01:20,353 --> 01:01:22,336
Community Relations Subcommittee, December 11, 2018.

410
01:01:22,476 --> 01:01:23,037
Mr. Jarrell.

411
01:01:32,635 --> 01:01:37,357
safety involvement and volunteering, but that's something we're still doing some more research on.

412
01:01:37,397 --> 01:01:44,901
There are three papers that we would like to have considered in the entire meeting, so I'll just go through the first of them right now.

413
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:50,644
The first item that was referred to us many months ago was about digital documents being posted online.

414
01:01:52,145 --> 01:02:00,689
Currently, many parents have asked me to post items personally, but we as a committee felt it would be best if we had a unified policy.

415
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:06,191
So, originally we wanted to do a number of research, which we did.

416
01:02:06,692 --> 01:02:08,853
First, we spoke with Dorothy Presser.

417
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:12,534
She's our representative for the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

418
01:02:13,835 --> 01:02:16,096
She has no official position.

419
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:20,358
There's no official guidance on digital documents being posted online.

420
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:25,741
However, she hasn't heard any negative feedback from the communities that do it.

421
01:02:26,561 --> 01:02:35,231
They also don't track it, but she said probably a sizable minority, maybe 40%, maybe 30% of communities do post online.

422
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:45,782
So after that, I called a number of different school committees and mostly superintendent's offices to see their position and see

423
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:50,623
what effect it had in their community posting these documents online.

424
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:55,224
There were basically four major areas that I asked them.

425
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:58,705
First, I asked them to describe their posting process.

426
01:02:58,825 --> 01:03:01,805
All of the communities I had a chance to talk to had different processes.

427
01:03:03,205 --> 01:03:05,566
Second, I asked, did it help or hurt the community?

428
01:03:06,226 --> 01:03:08,627
And what problems have you had in the implementation?

429
01:03:09,127 --> 01:03:12,127
Thirdly, I asked, what system did you use to post?

430
01:03:12,407 --> 01:03:15,528
And finally, I asked, did they have any unforeseen problems that arose?

431
01:03:17,688 --> 01:03:23,290
In short, all the communities I spoke to felt very positively about posting documents online.

432
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:33,132
None reported any significant problems from people using documents in a way that was not becoming or productive.

433
01:03:34,312 --> 01:03:37,313
First, I spoke with some people at Melrose.

434
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:39,293
I spoke to Diane Hogan.

435
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,194
She's the assistant to the superintendent there.

436
01:03:41,874 --> 01:03:46,155
Overall, she believed that they had a positive experience of posting packets online.

437
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:55,938
Their community posted packets 72 hours in advance, and they use a program called Grayness, which is used by the entire community.

438
01:03:58,939 --> 01:03:59,719
Diane, or Ms.

439
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:01,940
Hogan, believed it helped the community in real time.

440
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:03,529
And they've been doing it since 2012.

441
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:10,655
They also felt that there's a tendency for rumors to sort of spread through a community.

442
01:04:10,695 --> 01:04:15,079
But with the digital documents there, she felt that those kind of rumors were stymied.

443
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:20,144
I left a message with the people at Danvers, but they weren't able to get back to me.

444
01:04:20,164 --> 01:04:24,788
And I also called a couple of other districts and weren't able to get back to me.

445
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:31,773
But the people at Redding, whose name, the last name of this lady I unfortunately forgot to write down, her name was Linda.

446
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:34,235
She was also an executive assistant.

447
01:04:34,596 --> 01:04:36,778
She believed that they had a very positive experience.

448
01:04:37,298 --> 01:04:39,961
They posted 48 hours in advance of meetings.

449
01:04:41,282 --> 01:04:42,403
And they used PDFs.

450
01:04:42,743 --> 01:04:45,686
So they don't, they do not pay for any expensive system.

451
01:04:45,726 --> 01:04:47,327
They just post PDFs online.

452
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:51,376
Franklin Public Schools, I spoke to Denise Miller.

453
01:04:52,337 --> 01:04:54,680
They've had also a very positive experience with posting.

454
01:04:55,601 --> 01:04:59,567
They felt like there were no problems with doing anything online.

455
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:04,173
What they did was a system, actually I'm going to recommend that we do, they send a link

456
01:05:04,633 --> 01:05:06,395
to school committee members first.

457
01:05:07,056 --> 01:05:14,403
School committee members have a few hours to review the materials in advance, and then the link is sent to the community at large.

458
01:05:15,704 --> 01:05:21,109
They don't send presentations or superintendent notes beforehand, and they also use just PDFs.

459
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:24,391
Finally, I spoke to the people at Lexington.

460
01:05:25,072 --> 01:05:25,292
Ms.

461
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:27,373
Calvino is the executive assistant there.

462
01:05:27,974 --> 01:05:32,236
She was the most enthusiastic about posting documents online in advance.

463
01:05:32,676 --> 01:05:41,402
She felt that it was very helpful to members of the community, and she would have actually parents call her back if they were spelling errors or typos online, so that was something that they had.

464
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:50,907
She believes lots of parents use the documents and look forward to the packets to make sure that when they come to school committee meetings, they're prepared in advance.

465
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:59,671
She did have or their community had a little problem with posting PDFs on a timetable that the community understood.

466
01:06:00,132 --> 01:06:07,215
So they just recommend that maybe we have a trial period first to make sure that all the wrinkles are ironed out and yeah.

467
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,916
So there's no confusion about when things are posted.

468
01:06:12,577 --> 01:06:20,322
So our committee unanimously voted to do a similar program as they do in Franklin.

469
01:06:20,782 --> 01:06:31,930
We would like there to be a link sent to all school committee members at 12 noon to all school committee members, and then a link sent to the community at large at 4 p.m.

470
01:06:32,898 --> 01:06:39,883
These links would be in our entire packets, but what is confidential or materials that need to be presented and put in context?

471
01:06:40,383 --> 01:06:41,464
Can I interrupt you for a second?

472
01:06:41,484 --> 01:06:41,684
Absolutely.

473
01:06:41,704 --> 01:06:42,845
Is that in your committee report?

474
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:44,086
Because I don't see that.

475
01:06:44,106 --> 01:06:45,787
No, we haven't voted on the minutes yet.

476
01:06:45,867 --> 01:06:47,328
So you're going to go back to committee?

477
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:48,469
No, no.

478
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:51,851
We voted to send it to school committee.

479
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:52,371
I wasn't sure.

480
01:06:52,391 --> 01:06:53,032
Can we send?

481
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,364
But we didn't vote on those minutes.

482
01:06:58,384 --> 01:07:01,028
So we didn't get that committee report yet.

483
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:03,271
Yeah, we haven't voted on those minutes.

484
01:07:03,952 --> 01:07:08,880
But I believe at this point we've done a good amount of research on this issue and we can move this forward.

485
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:10,937
Ms.

486
01:07:10,957 --> 01:07:11,397
Van de Kloot.

487
01:07:11,998 --> 01:07:13,278
We don't have that in front of us.

488
01:07:13,338 --> 01:07:17,821
Michael, I didn't realize that you didn't have the written minutes for this meeting.

489
01:07:18,181 --> 01:07:20,522
So you need the minutes for this meeting.

490
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:21,022
Right.

491
01:07:21,202 --> 01:07:23,644
So you are reporting on things.

492
01:07:24,104 --> 01:07:30,908
The only thing is that there is one item that, because of a time constraint, needs to be reported out from the subcommittee right now.

493
01:07:31,648 --> 01:07:39,372
So in some ways, the other stuff you're providing for us on this topic, we don't have a report on.

494
01:07:41,494 --> 01:07:45,602
The piece that we need to report out because of a time constraint, if I

495
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:49,172
if I can proceed, or do you want to go with it?

496
01:07:49,292 --> 01:07:52,153
Well, I, oh, we can go ahead.

497
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:53,154
You can speak to that.

498
01:07:53,234 --> 01:08:08,323
Okay, so there's the piece that we need to proceed on is that the subcommittee suggested, Michael's been talking about other ways to make us accessible to the community, and the subcommittee had a long discussion about this.

499
01:08:08,904 --> 01:08:15,488
And one suggestion was providing, rather than a formal meeting, an opportunity for the community to have a

500
01:08:16,068 --> 01:08:21,456
meet-and-greet for school committee members for the community.

501
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:33,111
And to that end, we were thinking about what events already brought the community out, and there's one coming up in February.

502
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:37,472
which is the Medford Family Network Valentine's Social.

503
01:08:38,472 --> 01:08:56,517
And so we discussed the possibility of having a meet-and-greet hour before the Valentine's Social, so that at the Valentine's Social, we customarily go and we scoop ice cream, and it's really nice to see people, but it's not an opportunity to get into much conversation.

504
01:08:58,078 --> 01:09:18,674
I did speak to Marie Cassidy about this, and she understood, and she said that if we were to proceed on this, she could put a line in her flyer to say prior, you know, from 2 to 3, come meet the school committee, or whatever, from 11 to 12.

505
01:09:19,815 --> 01:09:24,119
But because she's getting that information out to the public, we should

506
01:09:25,235 --> 01:09:27,319
That's the piece that's critical for tonight.

507
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:33,351
So is there a motion to have the school committee hold a meet and greet the day of the social?

508
01:09:34,179 --> 01:09:34,299
Yes.

509
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:36,200
That was the recommendation of the committee?

510
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:36,900
Well, absolutely.

511
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:37,060
Yeah.

512
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,840
I'm just, I'm a little confused on the logistics of this matter.

513
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:46,302
So the minutes of the meeting haven't been posted because we haven't voted on our last meeting yet.

514
01:09:46,322 --> 01:09:47,982
You vote at the end of your meeting.

515
01:09:49,243 --> 01:09:55,504
We did vote at the end of our meeting to send these, to send the digital documents meeting forward to the whole committee.

516
01:09:55,764 --> 01:09:55,984
Okay.

517
01:09:56,184 --> 01:09:58,125
So there's two items I would like to be reviewed.

518
01:09:59,114 --> 01:10:06,916
that we vote for the meet and greet, and two, also, that we start posting digital documents online, which we've cleared with the administration.

519
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,177
That shouldn't be a problem to do.

520
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,898
We don't have a report.

521
01:10:12,838 --> 01:10:24,861
Mr. Benedetto, does two items on up, I second having the meet and greet on February, would have a day that, is it actually Valentine's Day?

522
01:10:24,881 --> 01:10:26,502
I can't remember what date it is.

523
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:27,722
I think it's the second Saturday.

524
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:40,266
OK, so at the Valentine's Day social that the Method Family Network provides, I second the motion on the floor for us to have that.

525
01:10:40,286 --> 01:10:41,227
Let's move that motion.

526
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:42,628
That's separate from the committee report.

527
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:43,969
Right.

528
01:10:44,189 --> 01:10:45,530
On the motion offered by Ms.

529
01:10:45,550 --> 01:10:47,832
Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

530
01:10:48,152 --> 01:10:52,375
All those in favor to host a meet and greet an hour before the Valentine social.

531
01:10:52,956 --> 01:10:53,616
All those in favor?

532
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:54,197
Aye.

533
01:10:54,537 --> 01:10:55,177
All those opposed?

534
01:10:55,678 --> 01:10:56,378
Motion passes.

535
01:10:56,398 --> 01:10:56,759
OK.

536
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:02,768
confused because he thought he was bringing the report to it.

537
01:11:02,928 --> 01:11:12,390
I have to explain that when you talked to me about it, I thought that the report that was on my desk was the report of this past meeting that we had on December 11th.

538
01:11:17,712 --> 01:11:21,793
We didn't have this in our packet on Friday either, this one, the November meeting.

539
01:11:22,193 --> 01:11:27,394
Okay, so that can hold over until you can bring it to the floor at the next meeting.

540
01:11:28,177 --> 01:11:33,078
Okay, and the motion that the November 2018 report be accepted and placed on file by Ms.

541
01:11:33,218 --> 01:11:36,599
Vandekloot, seconded by Mr. Russo.

542
01:11:36,619 --> 01:11:38,459
I was gonna call it Ruggiero.

543
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:39,900
All those in favor?

544
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:40,360
Aye.

545
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:41,160
All those opposed?

546
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:41,960
Motion passes.

547
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,901
Thank you very much.

548
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:45,441
Community participation.

549
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:49,242
I believe we have members of the Citywide PTO in attendance this evening.

550
01:11:49,622 --> 01:11:52,643
They've been hard at work over the last several months.

551
01:11:54,223 --> 01:11:56,784
If you'd like to go into detail on your efforts, please.

552
01:11:58,485 --> 01:12:00,948
Hi everyone, thank you so much for having us here.

553
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:08,716
I'm Christy Avino, this is Jenny Graham, and we are so excited to officially conclude our Disney Vacation Raffle.

554
01:12:09,297 --> 01:12:14,002
When we came together this summer as a group of a dozen, between 12 and 20 parents,

555
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:17,292
and volunteers from the four elementary schools.

556
01:12:17,372 --> 01:12:20,194
We decided that we wanted to do just a few things to get started.

557
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:29,080
There were some things that we thought were too big, and then we decided to do this Disney raffle, and I think you'll find that this has set the bar really high for sure, so we're really thrilled.

558
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:36,505
Before we announce the winner, we want to say thank you to a few people who were really, really critical in our effort.

559
01:12:36,525 --> 01:12:43,030
Thank you to Mayor Burke, Superintendent Edward Vincent, also to Allie Fisk and Deanna Devaney in the mayor's office.

560
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:49,991
Kevin Bailey and Danny Folks from the Recreation Department were very supportive, as was our City Clerk, Adam Herdeweis.

561
01:12:51,012 --> 01:13:04,175
Our elementary school principals were really critical in supporting our efforts, so thank you to Principal Johnson, Principal Guarino, Principal Kaye, and Principal Galluzzi, as well as their staff and all of the teachers who helped support us.

562
01:13:05,075 --> 01:13:09,996
We also want to thank the PTO boards at the schools, and most importantly, I think,

563
01:13:10,355 --> 01:13:14,879
All of the parents and kids who sold tickets and spread the word about our raffle.

564
01:13:14,899 --> 01:13:20,604
Some of our parents sold hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of tickets in support of this effort.

565
01:13:20,624 --> 01:13:21,745
So we were really thrilled.

566
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:25,388
Some enterprising elementary students spent hours.

567
01:13:25,908 --> 01:13:27,830
I promised my son I would give him a shout out.

568
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:32,874
He spent about 12 hours over six or seven events wearing his little Mickey ears.

569
01:13:33,635 --> 01:13:36,057
And I think we can say safely he has a great career.

570
01:13:36,393 --> 01:13:37,935
in either sales or politics.

571
01:13:37,975 --> 01:13:39,617
He knows about half of Medford now.

572
01:13:40,758 --> 01:13:42,340
So thank you all to those people.

573
01:13:43,001 --> 01:13:47,005
Our community was really, really gracious and supportive of us as well.

574
01:13:47,686 --> 01:13:50,289
Many welcomed us into their space and their events.

575
01:13:50,369 --> 01:13:51,931
So we want to thank St.

576
01:13:51,971 --> 01:13:55,295
Francis of Assisi Church, the Friends of Medford Public Library,

577
01:13:55,772 --> 01:14:05,414
Atlas Liquors on Mystic Ave, Bertucci's on Mystic Valley Parkway, Metro Rock Gym in Everett, 4 Good Vibes on Main Street, Friends of the Fells, Salem Street Studio.

578
01:14:05,454 --> 01:14:07,795
This was a really great effort from our community.

579
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:11,876
We also want to thank Wegmans for a very generous supporting donation.

580
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:17,757
And thank you also to the Irish American Club because they lent us this fabulous little raffle wheel.

581
01:14:20,017 --> 01:14:22,078
I'm going to turn it over to Jenny to tell you a little bit more.

582
01:14:22,098 --> 01:14:22,938
Thank you, Kristen.

583
01:14:23,875 --> 01:14:32,939
So there are a number of people who definitely won't win anything tonight, namely our raffle captains.

584
01:14:33,019 --> 01:14:45,105
So there were 10 folks who were identified as captains at the outset of this effort who were expressly prohibited from buying tickets, although they were asked to spend lots and lots and lots of hours helping other people be eligible to win.

585
01:14:46,243 --> 01:14:57,213
Our raffle captains included Christy Aveno, Jen Conti, myself, Melissa Maywalt, Maureen McSweeney, Doug Nagengast, Gary Pabst, Cheryl Rodriguez, Bob Russo, and Bailey Schendel.

586
01:14:58,033 --> 01:15:11,325
A special thank you to Tamara Morrow, who is the treasurer of the Brooks, and she is a raffle captain and the person who is responsible for the finances, the reporting, and raffle compliance, which is no small feat.

587
01:15:12,005 --> 01:15:13,827
We've learned a lot about raffles.

588
01:15:15,475 --> 01:15:19,116
But she has done an immensely huge task with ease.

589
01:15:20,357 --> 01:15:26,519
So we sold 4,824 tickets and received some donations along the way.

590
01:15:26,539 --> 01:15:28,440
Our gross sales were $24,178.

591
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:28,620
Yay.

592
01:15:38,482 --> 01:15:50,636
After we pay our raffle expenses, and we filed our required tax returns, and we pay our gaming taxes, our schools will each receive over $4,000, which is a huge addition to all of the PTOs.

593
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:53,539
So that's $4,000 to each elementary school, give or take.

594
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:55,761
the end of the bath.

595
01:15:57,282 --> 01:15:58,123
We're just getting started.

596
01:15:58,163 --> 01:15:59,825
We have two more events planned this spring.

597
01:16:00,366 --> 01:16:05,591
Our electronics recycling will return, and we'll have a Wizards game in the spring as well.

598
01:16:05,631 --> 01:16:06,952
And there will be more to come on both.

599
01:16:08,013 --> 01:16:10,516
But the reason that we're here is to pull the winner.

600
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:12,278
So the raffle wheel is there.

601
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:13,929
It's quite full.

602
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:21,853
We did mix everything around and shake it up and the wheel can be spun a few more times for good measure.

603
01:16:22,653 --> 01:16:26,715
The first prize that we would like Dr. Edward Vincent to pull is the grand prize winner.

604
01:16:27,555 --> 01:16:33,038
The grand prize of the raffle is $5,000 in Disney gift cards or a cash equivalent.

605
01:16:34,019 --> 01:16:38,983
The grand prize winner can, at their option, use the gift cards to book a vacation at a Disney resort or Disney cruise.

606
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:49,452
Shannon Demos, the assistant principal at the Brooks School, is a local resident Disney expert and has volunteered her time to help the winner plan their vacation, if they so choose.

607
01:16:51,194 --> 01:16:58,340
The $5,000 grand prize may or may not cover the whole cost of a vacation, including airfare, accommodation, and dining, subject to the winner's booking preferences.

608
01:16:58,940 --> 01:17:01,521
You can go to Disney all kinds of different ways.

609
01:17:02,082 --> 01:17:05,883
So $5,000 is kind of a blank canvas for whoever that winner is.

610
01:17:07,204 --> 01:17:11,546
The winner must be 18 years of age or older and a US citizen or lawful permanent resident.

611
01:17:12,446 --> 01:17:17,649
The winner must claim their prize in seven business days, so excluding Christmas, which is a federally recognized holiday.

612
01:17:17,689 --> 01:17:22,311
This means the prize must be claimed by December 27th at 5 or we will draw a new winner.

613
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,112
So if you would do the honors and pull the winner.

614
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:28,610
Spin that drum.

615
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:30,251
Reach in there really good.

616
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:32,873
Whoa, that is hot.

617
01:17:33,694 --> 01:17:34,995
It is quite full.

618
01:17:35,135 --> 01:17:37,897
Okay, the winner is Lynn Freitas, 26 Stearns Avenue, Medford.

619
01:17:37,917 --> 01:17:40,619
Woo, all right.

620
01:17:55,685 --> 01:17:58,387
Does anyone know Lynn?

621
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:02,531
Does anybody know Lynn?

622
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:04,092
We will take that and call her.

623
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:09,576
And then if you would also pull one more ticket, there is a second place prize.

624
01:18:09,716 --> 01:18:12,559
It is a $250 Disney gift card.

625
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,023
The same rules apply about claiming the prize and US residents and all of that good stuff.

626
01:18:18,123 --> 01:18:19,884
But the second prize winner will be pulled now.

627
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:22,426
It is packed.

628
01:18:22,747 --> 01:18:23,928
We needed a bigger drum.

629
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:29,352
So next year we'll also be on the hunt for a slightly bigger drum.

630
01:18:30,092 --> 01:18:32,794
We can get you one of the recycling bins.

631
01:18:33,154 --> 01:18:35,136
Composting.

632
01:18:36,497 --> 01:18:38,919
Alright, the winner is Mara Kennedy.

633
01:18:39,499 --> 01:18:40,820
Mara Kennedy.

634
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,962
49 Salton Stall Road, Medford.

635
01:18:50,862 --> 01:18:51,502
Nice job.

636
01:18:52,122 --> 01:18:55,943
So thank you very much for playing along here and pulling our winners.

637
01:18:56,023 --> 01:19:01,424
So we'll take those from you, and we will take the wheel and empty it out and get it back to the Irish-American as well.

638
01:19:01,524 --> 01:19:04,085
I know you all worked very, very hard.

639
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:08,306
I saw you at so many events, including election day, pre-election day.

640
01:19:08,646 --> 01:19:09,686
You guys were everywhere.

641
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:14,727
So kudos to all of you for what you've done in investing in your schools and our schools.

642
01:19:14,787 --> 01:19:15,448
So thank you.

643
01:19:15,468 --> 01:19:16,268
Thanks.

644
01:19:31,255 --> 01:19:32,195
Thank you very much.

645
01:19:34,496 --> 01:19:35,396
Mr. Benedetto.

646
01:19:35,516 --> 01:19:35,936
Thank you.

647
01:19:38,536 --> 01:19:50,039
Under community participation, I got a note from the daughter of Lena DeGentema, so regarding the event we had, those of you who don't know,

648
01:19:50,715 --> 01:19:54,137
We named the music room the Gigentmaso Music Room.

649
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:56,398
I think the superintendent had it in her comments.

650
01:19:56,978 --> 01:19:58,339
Oh, good.

651
01:19:58,659 --> 01:20:03,522
So from her daughter, she just wrote, Erin, thank you again for the wonderful evening last night.

652
01:20:04,002 --> 01:20:10,786
The ceremony that the district provided was truly humbling.

653
01:20:11,626 --> 01:20:15,408
And my mom loved this dedication more than words could tell.

654
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,182
Thank you for a wonderful, memorable night.

655
01:20:19,322 --> 01:20:24,826
And please tell Lisa Evangelista we realize how much time and effort she put into the event.

656
01:20:25,507 --> 01:20:25,727
So.

657
01:20:26,387 --> 01:20:26,728
Very good.

658
01:20:26,808 --> 01:20:27,188
Thank you.

659
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:27,769
Pass that on.

660
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:33,233
On the motion for items, did you like to speak on this?

661
01:20:33,593 --> 01:20:34,093
Oh, I'm sorry.

662
01:20:34,133 --> 01:20:34,434
Oh, hi.

663
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:34,974
That's OK.

664
01:20:35,655 --> 01:20:38,877
Sorry it was a little slow coming up for the participation.

665
01:20:38,897 --> 01:20:39,938
Hi, everyone.

666
01:20:39,958 --> 01:20:40,719
Hi, Mayor Burke.

667
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:41,899
Hi, Superintendent.

668
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,200
Hi, members of the committee.

669
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:46,383
I'm Carolyn Montello, 108 Ashcroft Road.

670
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:52,022
And this evening, I wanted to bring up the issue of heat at the high school.

671
01:20:53,764 --> 01:21:03,673
After a few recent very cold visits to the high school's Karen Theater and gym, I began to look into what might be the issue with the heat at the high school.

672
01:21:04,453 --> 01:21:07,376
I was told that the heat in the theater is broken.

673
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,938
It sounds like a part has been ordered.

674
01:21:10,626 --> 01:21:12,087
and should be installed soon.

675
01:21:12,767 --> 01:21:17,008
But I was also informed that the gym only has one unit left working.

676
01:21:17,708 --> 01:21:19,429
That's the unit in cage three.

677
01:21:20,089 --> 01:21:23,710
And the others are basically gone and have been that way for years.

678
01:21:25,491 --> 01:21:32,393
I also heard from parents recently that the school, that the pool area seems to be having heating issues as well.

679
01:21:33,654 --> 01:21:40,256
And for years, I've heard from students as well as teachers that some of the classrooms are so cold in the winter

680
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:43,411
that students need to wear their coats inside.

681
01:21:44,071 --> 01:21:52,454
And a student this year told me that in one classroom, students are allowed to bring in blankets because it's so cold.

682
01:21:53,315 --> 01:22:00,197
So I think most parents assume that their school is heated when they send their kids off to school in the winter.

683
01:22:00,617 --> 01:22:03,478
So I don't think that people even think to ask the question.

684
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:10,321
I would like to ask a member of the committee to make a motion to immediately

685
01:22:11,141 --> 01:22:21,404
audit the current heating system throughout the high school, and provide an update at the next school committee meeting, and make any repairs if and as needed.

686
01:22:21,724 --> 01:22:23,365
So moved by member Van de Kloot.

687
01:22:24,225 --> 01:22:29,807
Also, just regarding the theater, a coil is on order, and it will be installed over the holidays.

688
01:22:30,386 --> 01:22:31,226
the holiday break.

689
01:22:31,386 --> 01:22:33,247
So that's the worst case it will be installed.

690
01:22:34,007 --> 01:22:36,708
And two out of the four heaters are working in the gym.

691
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:38,268
Does it say enough heat?

692
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,050
It's sufficient heat in the gym area?

693
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:44,390
It's two out of four.

694
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:45,170
Two out of four.

695
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:53,812
So you're going to hear a little later from the superintendent on an item that we applied for MSBA school funding.

696
01:22:54,273 --> 01:22:58,934
She's going to be making not a great announcement, unfortunately.

697
01:22:59,713 --> 01:23:01,534
Member Van de Kloot, just move your motion.

698
01:23:01,594 --> 01:23:02,975
Is there a second to the item?

699
01:23:03,435 --> 01:23:04,776
Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

700
01:23:05,016 --> 01:23:06,016
Did I miss you?

701
01:23:06,377 --> 01:23:06,637
I'm sorry.

702
01:23:07,517 --> 01:23:08,078
Okay, thank you.

703
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:19,964
And just with the heat in the gym, it's definitely, I don't know if they don't turn it on on the weekends, but I'm there for basketball games on the weekends and the gym is freezing.

704
01:23:20,244 --> 01:23:23,526
Everyone has down coats on, people from other communities.

705
01:23:24,116 --> 01:23:26,037
coming to the games, comment on it, so.

706
01:23:26,337 --> 01:23:28,478
I was just there, like, what, a week ago?

707
01:23:28,738 --> 01:23:33,721
We were both there, and we had coats off, and comfortable, but we'll have an audit done.

708
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:34,441
Yeah, that would be great.

709
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:35,262
We'll investigate it further.

710
01:23:35,282 --> 01:23:35,642
Thank you.

711
01:23:35,662 --> 01:23:36,002
Definitely.

712
01:23:36,022 --> 01:23:36,642
Thank you very much.

713
01:23:37,683 --> 01:23:38,323
On the motion.

714
01:23:38,363 --> 01:23:39,004
Thank you, Ms.

715
01:23:39,024 --> 01:23:39,404
Mantello.

716
01:23:40,144 --> 01:23:40,764
On the motion.

717
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:42,205
All in favor?

718
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:42,285
Aye.

719
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:43,746
All opposed?

720
01:23:44,266 --> 01:23:45,067
Motion is granted.

721
01:23:46,948 --> 01:23:48,248
Report of the superintendent.

722
01:23:49,329 --> 01:23:49,549
Madam?

723
01:23:57,434 --> 01:23:58,414
Good evening everyone.

724
01:23:59,494 --> 01:24:10,037
So last Thursday, prior to the winter high school orchestra concert, we enjoyed a wonderful event celebrating former school committee member Lina DiGentimasso.

725
01:24:10,997 --> 01:24:14,898
The Medford High School Music Room was dedicated in her honor by Mayor Burke.

726
01:24:15,895 --> 01:24:18,897
Lena and her family could not have been more appreciative.

727
01:24:19,497 --> 01:24:31,765
I would be remiss if I did not thank our Fine Arts Director, Tony Zigny, for his gracious assistance, and the Medford High School Orchestra for their wonderful musical selections.

728
01:24:32,365 --> 01:24:40,910
I'd also like to recognize Principal Chad Fallon and the Culinary Arts Program for providing the pre-ceremony reception.

729
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:45,013
It was truly a collaborative effort between the school committee

730
01:24:45,828 --> 01:24:49,130
the city council to honor Ms.

731
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:54,994
DeGenta Maso, who devoted a great part of her life to the Medford Public Schools and our community.

732
01:24:55,614 --> 01:25:00,237
The plaque is in place right now over the door of the music room in A building.

733
01:25:01,338 --> 01:25:03,960
So I wanted to just recognize that.

734
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,882
I also wanted to talk a little bit about CCSR.

735
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:11,985
Our CCSR students have been quite busy of late.

736
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:13,966
The Medford High School members have been visiting

737
01:25:15,845 --> 01:25:26,167
with students in both, the high school students have been visiting with our students at the elementary and middle school levels to discuss CCSR goals and objectives.

738
01:25:27,107 --> 01:25:39,750
And they were assisted, again, by Rhetta Smith and the Garden Club in planting the new orchard that we do now have in place, and we'll hear a little bit more about that in detail.

739
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,790
And some of them are here with us.

740
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:44,651
We had 10 pear trees.

741
01:25:45,631 --> 01:25:48,272
planted, blackberries and raspberries were planted.

742
01:25:49,332 --> 01:25:50,192
Not at this point in time.

743
01:25:50,212 --> 01:25:52,153
You'll come up a little later for a separate report.

744
01:25:53,313 --> 01:25:59,475
And currently the CCSR are in the process of collecting toys for Tots.

745
01:25:59,895 --> 01:26:01,715
So I just want to put that out there as well.

746
01:26:03,056 --> 01:26:10,478
Our Spanish II honors class at the high school, they have Skyped with students in Bolivia.

747
01:26:11,758 --> 01:26:23,082
and our students were able to practice their conversational Spanish, while their students were able to practice conversational English, and our students truly enjoyed this learning experience.

748
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,823
This unique learning experience, I should say.

749
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:36,547
Hope Chest, so last week, the Medford High School Vocational School Hope Chest Food Pantry, Priscilla's Pantry, opened.

750
01:26:37,269 --> 01:26:41,090
and the pantry is available for all students and is free of charge.

751
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:45,611
The pantry has shelf-stable foods and household goods.

752
01:26:46,772 --> 01:26:55,314
It will be open Thursdays after school from 2.30 to 3.30 with the hopes of expanding operating hours in the near future.

753
01:26:55,914 --> 01:27:00,576
The pantry is located next to the third floor lecture hall in C building.

754
01:27:01,196 --> 01:27:04,957
And I would like to thank the following who made Priscilla's Pantry possible.

755
01:27:05,717 --> 01:27:22,861
the Hoff Family Foundation, the Greater Boston Food Bank, in partnership with the Malden YMCA, along with the district's nutritionist, Retta Smith, and teachers Annie Saulnier, Emily Polini, and John Wilson.

756
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:28,362
This is another great example of collaboration that benefits our students and families.

757
01:27:30,903 --> 01:27:32,386
Empowering Girls Conference.

758
01:27:33,268 --> 01:27:40,002
So on Wednesday, November 28th, a group of 8th grade students from the Andrews Middle School

759
01:27:40,831 --> 01:27:47,074
attended the Empowering Girls 2018 conference at the Cary Memorial Building in Lexington.

760
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:57,920
It was hosted by Middlesex DA, Marion Ryan, and the all-day program was designed for middle school girls with the theme of She Persisted.

761
01:27:58,801 --> 01:28:09,987
The students and their chaperones, Katie Fumara, who's an adjustment counselor, and Yvonne Santos, a guidance counselor, were met with opening remarks from Marion Ryan.

762
01:28:10,847 --> 01:28:16,851
who discussed the importance of persisting through difficulties and going after the career you want.

763
01:28:17,692 --> 01:28:27,599
The Andrews students listened to guest speakers, asked questions, participated in activities, and left feeling empowered and invigorated about their futures.

764
01:28:28,439 --> 01:28:29,180
Thanks to D.A.

765
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:39,067
Ryan, the Empowering Girls 2018 program, it ended up being a huge success, and the Andrews will definitely return next year.

766
01:28:41,028 --> 01:28:48,695
On the sports venue, Medford High School and our vocational school combined, our winter sports season has officially begun.

767
01:28:48,715 --> 01:28:56,702
And our La Conte ice rink is offering expanded public skating over the holiday break.

768
01:28:56,862 --> 01:28:59,465
And all of that is listed on our website and our blog.

769
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:04,866
I continue to have a focus on looking at instruction.

770
01:29:05,727 --> 01:29:10,290
I am really trying to stick to my goal of being in schools at least twice a week.

771
01:29:11,291 --> 01:29:14,213
And I am continuing to witness and observe instruction.

772
01:29:15,575 --> 01:29:20,318
Over the past two weeks, I have been at the Columbus, the Roberts, the Brooks.

773
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:24,522
It's really uplifting to see how devoted our teachers are.

774
01:29:25,662 --> 01:29:30,123
in terms of implementing their curriculum and really being focused on our students.

775
01:29:31,903 --> 01:29:38,505
Additionally, earlier today I was at the Columbus and I was able to spend time with one of our math coaches.

776
01:29:38,905 --> 01:29:46,926
As you know, math is one of my goals and a serious focus of a lot of my instruction, although it's not exclusively mathematics.

777
01:29:47,547 --> 01:29:50,467
And I was able to work with Ellie O'Leary today.

778
01:29:51,247 --> 01:29:54,628
And I spent time with the fifth grade team at the Columbus School.

779
01:29:55,228 --> 01:30:16,419
I had the opportunity to observe inclusion math and special education teacher Wendy Anderson was working collaboratively with the teacher, so it was wonderful to see inclusion at work and instruction happening and students focusing on math and having an opportunity to productively struggle.

780
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:20,866
and be challenged, but know it's for a good reason, a good cause.

781
01:30:21,686 --> 01:30:27,690
So as I've been looking at instruction, I've had the opportunity to look at instruction with principals.

782
01:30:28,191 --> 01:30:41,860
When I was at the Brooks, I got to walk this last time with the assistant principal and members of my leadership team, and I also go to schools independently, so just continuing to keep my eyes on instruction.

783
01:30:43,367 --> 01:30:49,834
Another important thing happening in the district right now is ACE advisors and coaches in education.

784
01:30:50,675 --> 01:31:00,946
This past week, Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Principals Nick Tucci of the McGlynn Middle School and Michael Downs, Principal of the Andrews Middle School,

785
01:31:01,603 --> 01:31:13,009
Assistant Principal David Blouk at the high school, as well as Penny Funiali and Lisa Bandonian, met to discuss the ACE project at the middle schools.

786
01:31:13,610 --> 01:31:22,615
The ACE project, again, Advisors and Coaches in Education, is a project of the Medford Health Department, Team Medford, and Medford Public Schools.

787
01:31:23,555 --> 01:31:45,663
The purpose of the ACE project is to educate and train club advisors and coaches on how to effectively build meaningful relationships with students through search institutes, evidence-based model for developmental relationships, which will help to reduce substance abuse and other risky behaviors in youth.

788
01:31:46,483 --> 01:31:51,945
Medford High School already has ACE in place, so this is now moving down to the middle schools.

789
01:31:54,506 --> 01:31:55,208
on safety.

790
01:31:55,870 --> 01:32:02,125
Our principals and administrators have been actively working together on upgrading our building security plans.

791
01:32:03,348 --> 01:32:24,314
All schools-based principals, Officer Ziobro and John McLaughlin, we met in a closed-door meeting session to discuss our current security practices and measures and examining the Safe Havens reports from a district perspective of what things we can do to continue to keep Medford safe.

792
01:32:24,995 --> 01:32:32,657
Additionally, last week, Officer Ziobro, Lieutenant Paul Covino, Principal Nick Tucci and Principal Brian Toomey,

793
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:39,079
They all attended safety workshops that were conducted by Safe Havens last week.

794
01:32:39,779 --> 01:32:50,986
And they reported out on the workshops, and they shared with the principal group when we were discussing our security and safety plans.

795
01:32:53,488 --> 01:32:57,010
MSBA, which is the Massachusetts School Building Authority,

796
01:32:58,555 --> 01:33:04,885
The MSBA did announce at the end of last week that they awarded their award recipients.

797
01:33:04,945 --> 01:33:06,487
They awarded 14 districts.

798
01:33:07,168 --> 01:33:11,455
Unfortunately, at this time Medford was not selected this year.

799
01:33:11,935 --> 01:33:14,079
However, we will continue to apply.

800
01:33:14,845 --> 01:33:17,306
for funding to renovate our high school complex.

801
01:33:18,047 --> 01:33:26,311
In light of not being selected, we will continue to work collaboratively with the city for targeted capital improvement projects.

802
01:33:26,391 --> 01:33:30,913
So it's something that we're gonna continue to work on and work at.

803
01:33:32,473 --> 01:33:41,735
Another very important topic that has surfaced and the school committee members were requesting an update on vaping.

804
01:33:42,435 --> 01:33:51,158
And vaping is definitely a serious concern that the country is facing and Medford is not excluded from this challenge.

805
01:33:53,543 --> 01:33:57,904
We take this very seriously as a district and as a city.

806
01:33:59,145 --> 01:34:10,848
Our school administration is very aware of the public health issues and how it's affecting our students and the community at large.

807
01:34:12,809 --> 01:34:21,792
Here is, I'm going to share just a few brief overview of steps that we've taken thus far and that we're going to continue to address the issue of vaping as a district.

808
01:34:23,923 --> 01:34:26,144
with a focus on the whole child.

809
01:34:26,944 --> 01:34:30,305
We have engaged in specific student education around vaping.

810
01:34:31,245 --> 01:34:37,747
They are addressing it in some portions of the curriculum that we're using, the Michigan model.

811
01:34:38,967 --> 01:34:44,429
Student support to assist students who are at risk and engaging in risky behaviors.

812
01:34:45,009 --> 01:34:50,671
Community partnerships in collaboration with the Medford Board of Health.

813
01:34:51,451 --> 01:34:55,713
and frequent ongoing education and outreach for parents and staff.

814
01:34:56,174 --> 01:35:12,202
We are also looking into providing in collaboration with the city, providing like a parent support group that could be available to parents at the high school and offer that.

815
01:35:12,242 --> 01:35:15,364
So those are some of the things that we're trying to do.

816
01:35:15,544 --> 01:35:17,605
So knowing that vaping is

817
01:35:18,105 --> 01:35:19,687
truly a serious concern.

818
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:34,265
I wanted to just put it on the floor that it is something that we are taking very seriously, but because this is truly a large issue, we did not have enough time to prepare a comprehensive report.

819
01:35:34,873 --> 01:35:37,996
on specific numbers and statistics of things that are happening.

820
01:35:38,056 --> 01:35:46,745
So we're in the process of combining that to come back to you in January to give you a more robust presentation.

821
01:35:47,185 --> 01:35:51,510
And we would like to, we are trying to ask Dr. Schuster

822
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:58,814
and Team Medford from the Department of Public Health to come and share their wealth of knowledge with us.

823
01:35:59,254 --> 01:36:02,136
So I'm shooting for the second meeting in January.

824
01:36:02,516 --> 01:36:12,262
Dr. Schuster has already conducted professional development with members of Team Medford at the high school to all school leaders and

825
01:36:13,283 --> 01:36:28,069
director-level administrators, and that was a very, very informative training, a lot of positive feedback, and they would like her to come back, and we would like her to also be able to come and present as an expert in the field.

826
01:36:29,009 --> 01:36:32,691
So that is where we are with our work around vaping.

827
01:36:33,732 --> 01:36:38,634
On another note, I wanted to just say today I had the pleasure of being at the Roberts School.

828
01:36:40,375 --> 01:36:45,638
I was invited to see their hand chimes concert.

829
01:36:47,178 --> 01:36:51,221
And their music instructor, Mr. Jim Connors, is truly masterful.

830
01:36:51,821 --> 01:36:55,143
Our arts department as a district is phenomenal.

831
01:36:55,844 --> 01:36:59,966
And today was another special treat by fourth and fifth graders.

832
01:37:01,007 --> 01:37:02,848
They played the hand chimes.

833
01:37:02,888 --> 01:37:09,372
In addition to that, musical pieces, drums, xylophones, recorders.

834
01:37:09,673 --> 01:37:12,474
And I saw for the first time today

835
01:37:13,655 --> 01:37:17,977
tenor recorder and a bass recorder, I had not seen them.

836
01:37:18,037 --> 01:37:23,520
So students were not only playing traditional recorders, but tenor and bass recorders.

837
01:37:24,021 --> 01:37:34,726
So I could definitely see that under Mr. Connor's leadership that we definitely have additional, the band pipeline in the making.

838
01:37:35,927 --> 01:37:38,351
hear the band music playing as I observed them.

839
01:37:38,932 --> 01:37:42,218
So that was truly a positive experience.

840
01:37:42,658 --> 01:37:48,989
And I want to just thank the Roberts School, Principal Johnson, and the team that were there to

841
01:37:50,141 --> 01:37:52,222
during the concert, it was really a great experience.

842
01:37:52,902 --> 01:38:03,147
And then lastly, I would like to wish all of you, the school committee and the members of the community, a happy holiday season, a restful break.

843
01:38:04,807 --> 01:38:09,669
I know Hanukkah has ended, but happy Hanukkah to all of those who did celebrate the holiday.

844
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:18,013
I'd like to wish merry Christmas and happy Kwanzaa, and a healthy, happy, prosperous, peaceful new year to you all.

845
01:38:18,694 --> 01:38:21,555
Thank you so much.

846
01:38:22,435 --> 01:38:22,995
Thank you.

847
01:38:23,575 --> 01:38:23,795
Ms.

848
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:24,395
Vander Kloot.

849
01:38:25,156 --> 01:38:38,479
I just want to mention within all of the things that you mentioned, there also was an incredibly great middle school concert last Thursday night, which I had the pleasure and opportunity to attend.

850
01:38:39,059 --> 01:38:47,521
And as you know, our middle school select ensemble has been gold medal winners many times over.

851
01:38:48,141 --> 01:38:53,742
All of the levels, the 6th grade, the 7th and 8th, and the ensemble really did a terrific job.

852
01:38:54,442 --> 01:38:54,723
And Ms.

853
01:38:54,763 --> 01:38:57,623
Chang is just an amazing teacher.

854
01:38:57,943 --> 01:38:59,964
So I wanted to mention that tonight too.

855
01:39:00,164 --> 01:39:00,544
Thank you.

856
01:39:01,284 --> 01:39:01,664
Thank you.

857
01:39:03,785 --> 01:39:05,585
Superintendent's updates and comments.

858
01:39:06,225 --> 01:39:07,886
Thank you so much for all that information.

859
01:39:09,006 --> 01:39:12,086
Report on planting of orchard at Medford High School.

860
01:39:13,627 --> 01:39:13,807
Ms.

861
01:39:13,827 --> 01:39:14,267
Caldwell.

862
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:16,000
Hello.

863
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:25,303
Well, as you know, you voted this past year to bring an orchard to Medford High School to beautify our grounds even more than they are.

864
01:39:26,023 --> 01:39:34,386
We did have some difficulty about where this was going to take place, but I think we've worked out a solution thanks to Retta Smith, who is our nutritionist.

865
01:39:34,826 --> 01:39:35,866
Would you come up, please, Retta?

866
01:39:37,227 --> 01:39:40,788
And I'd like to introduce to you two very important people who have

867
01:39:41,263 --> 01:39:43,945
who are from CCSR who spearheaded this as well.

868
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:50,828
Kaylee Boulay and Prabhiti Rama would like to say a few words.

869
01:39:51,709 --> 01:39:51,969
Girls?

870
01:39:55,811 --> 01:39:56,612
Good afternoon.

871
01:39:56,632 --> 01:40:06,417
In the beginning of last year, we connected with Food Service Nutritionist Specialist Rhetta Smith about our interest in addressing food insecurity through our project

872
01:40:06,876 --> 01:40:11,858
with the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, also known as CCSR.

873
01:40:12,578 --> 01:40:19,041
The original plan was to apply for all grants with the hopes of establishing a fruit orchard on the MHS campus.

874
01:40:19,601 --> 01:40:25,623
Sean Driscoll Gomez joined the group shortly after and the plan then developed into a larger scope project.

875
01:40:26,283 --> 01:40:32,946
With goals of beautification the exterior of the school through murals and creating an outdoor classroom in addition to planting the orchard

876
01:40:33,503 --> 01:40:43,512
Sean has since graduated, but we have picked up additional CCSR students, Emily Gotti in the spring of 2018 and Jenna Matarazzo in the fall of 2018.

877
01:40:43,592 --> 01:40:53,520
The project garnered much community support, but there were concerns among the school staff and its administration regarding the proposed location for the orchard.

878
01:40:54,257 --> 01:41:00,680
After much discussion, it was decided the best location for the orchard would be in the interior courtyard of the high school.

879
01:41:01,341 --> 01:41:05,543
My peer, Kaylee Boulay, will explain.

880
01:41:06,903 --> 01:41:17,369
Hi, so I'm Kaylee Boulay, and on Friday, December 7th, we had the opportunity to plant 10 Asian pear trees, 10 blackberry bushes, and 10 raspberry bushes.

881
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:22,731
I, now a sophomore in Medford High, along with sophomores for B.D.

882
01:41:22,832 --> 01:41:23,092
Rana,

883
01:41:26,049 --> 01:41:42,617
Emily Gotti, and Jenna Matarazzo, with assistance from sophomore biology students, Dorven Edward, Enrique Ramos, Gabriela Paz-Luiz, and Jose Avelar Serrano, were able to join in in the planting.

884
01:41:43,418 --> 01:41:47,620
We, the students, planted three of the ten trees and all ten blackberry bushes.

885
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:53,743
We all enjoyed being outside, and despite the cold, working in the sunshine was surprisingly pleasant.

886
01:41:54,673 --> 01:42:03,798
We hope to continue the project in the spring by creating a simple, low-cost outdoor classroom space so that teachers will be able to hold class in the space if they like.

887
01:42:04,799 --> 01:42:15,024
Tufts College students are working on lesson plans that meet Massachusetts learning standards that teachers of various disciplines can utilize to integrate the Orchard with their class of desire.

888
01:42:15,805 --> 01:42:18,806
The project was partially funded by CCSR and the Cummings Grant.

889
01:42:19,367 --> 01:42:19,787
Wonderful.

890
01:42:20,027 --> 01:42:20,487
Great job.

891
01:42:21,248 --> 01:42:21,708
Excellent.

892
01:42:23,947 --> 01:42:30,252
Look at that.

893
01:42:30,753 --> 01:42:35,697
Well you can see the enthusiasm and such a great idea and we're so happy that this has come to fruition.

894
01:42:35,737 --> 01:42:41,562
I know you worked hard on it and you had a couple of setbacks but you kept going and that's the big learning lesson.

895
01:42:41,602 --> 01:42:43,704
You kept pushing through so congratulations.

896
01:42:44,154 --> 01:42:45,835
Can't wait to see the fruits of your labor.

897
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:50,119
Ms.

898
01:42:50,139 --> 01:42:50,959
Domenedetto.

899
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:59,266
Was part of the reason you chose the interior courtyard because of the deer that come out in the evening?

900
01:42:59,286 --> 01:43:00,107
And now the bear.

901
01:43:02,068 --> 01:43:04,410
Now that we have a bear in the midst, too.

902
01:43:04,850 --> 01:43:08,073
That was part of the reason, because we could better

903
01:43:10,175 --> 01:43:11,917
you know, confine what we needed to.

904
01:43:11,957 --> 01:43:15,000
We were worried about rodents and small animals.

905
01:43:15,061 --> 01:43:18,945
And if we put it outside on the field, the kids practice and play on the field.

906
01:43:19,688 --> 01:43:21,928
And there's another area where younger children play.

907
01:43:22,469 --> 01:43:24,749
So this seemed like the perfect place for it.

908
01:43:25,349 --> 01:43:26,469
I think it's a great idea.

909
01:43:26,489 --> 01:43:29,190
More convenient, too, for the classroom aspect of it.

910
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:30,510
I really like the idea.

911
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:31,951
I think it's going to look beautiful.

912
01:43:32,011 --> 01:43:34,731
And that courtyard needed a little sprucing up.

913
01:43:35,651 --> 01:43:36,592
So thank you.

914
01:43:36,612 --> 01:43:36,992
Very nice.

915
01:43:37,092 --> 01:43:37,492
Thank you.

916
01:43:37,552 --> 01:43:39,712
Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report?

917
01:43:39,852 --> 01:43:40,332
So moved.

918
01:43:40,352 --> 01:43:43,473
So moved by Mr. Bennis, seconded by Mr. Russo.

919
01:43:43,513 --> 01:43:44,233
All those in favor?

920
01:43:44,253 --> 01:43:44,313
Aye.

921
01:43:45,233 --> 01:43:45,853
All those opposed?

922
01:43:45,913 --> 01:43:46,634
Motion passes.

923
01:43:46,734 --> 01:43:47,534
Congratulations.

924
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:55,213
Report on BotBall, New England Regional Robotics Tournament.

925
01:43:57,975 --> 01:43:58,476
Good evening.

926
01:43:58,516 --> 01:44:08,303
So this is under my header for finances acceptance, but we have Faiza Khan here, the supervisor director of our mathematics department, to give you more information on this project.

927
01:44:08,604 --> 01:44:08,964
Excellent.

928
01:44:11,797 --> 01:44:12,237
Good evening.

929
01:44:12,658 --> 01:44:13,298
Good evening.

930
01:44:14,299 --> 01:44:15,640
Thank you for having me here.

931
01:44:16,020 --> 01:44:17,561
And I'm so sorry for my voice.

932
01:44:17,581 --> 01:44:19,362
Thank you for giving me the report.

933
01:44:20,063 --> 01:44:20,643
I'll try to.

934
01:44:20,703 --> 01:44:24,045
Of course, the heating system goes on when you start to talk.

935
01:44:24,285 --> 01:44:24,786
Thank you.

936
01:44:24,806 --> 01:44:25,846
Thank you.

937
01:44:26,207 --> 01:44:26,807
I'll let Ms.

938
01:44:26,867 --> 01:44:33,812
Chen, who is the advisor of the club, read the report and then do further justice to the information.

939
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:34,212
Thank you.

940
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:46,966
Method High School's robotic team has received a donation in the amount of $2,000 from MeDay Technology to compete in the New England Regional Bot Ball Competition 2019.

941
01:44:47,046 --> 01:45:03,597
The robotics team at Method High School engaged students using science, engineering, technology, mathematics, and writing skills to design, build, program, and document robots in a hands-on project that reinforced their learning.

942
01:45:04,543 --> 01:45:13,767
It has been competing with support from Midday Technology in the ball competitions since 2012 and has won many awards over the years.

943
01:45:14,667 --> 01:45:15,068
Excellent.

944
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:16,948
Well, once again, we want to thank Midday.

945
01:45:17,009 --> 01:45:18,689
They've been a fabulous partner with us.

946
01:45:19,169 --> 01:45:22,071
They came through again on this most important item.

947
01:45:22,471 --> 01:45:25,032
And we know that they work with our McGlynn students all the time.

948
01:45:25,072 --> 01:45:26,112
They have a program there.

949
01:45:26,233 --> 01:45:28,814
And they're invested in our community.

950
01:45:28,854 --> 01:45:29,934
They're up on Boston Ave.

951
01:45:29,974 --> 01:45:32,875
And they've been fabulous, fabulous corporate partners.

952
01:45:32,895 --> 01:45:33,956
So thank you, Midday.

953
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,722
Can we send out a thank you letter to them as well?

954
01:45:38,243 --> 01:45:44,487
Motion to, it is recommended to accept the donation for the use and purpose of the schools for the spot bowl.

955
01:45:46,028 --> 01:45:46,749
Motion by Ms.

956
01:45:46,769 --> 01:45:48,230
Vanden Heuvel, seconded by Ms.

957
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:49,050
DiBenedetto.

958
01:45:49,070 --> 01:45:49,951
Roll call vote please.

959
01:45:59,094 --> 01:45:59,394
Yes.

960
01:46:02,015 --> 01:46:02,315
Yes.

961
01:46:02,695 --> 01:46:05,856
And that is a $2,000 donation that we are gladly accepting.

962
01:46:05,996 --> 01:46:06,876
Thank you so much.

963
01:46:07,156 --> 01:46:07,716
Great job.

964
01:46:10,377 --> 01:46:10,577
Ms.

965
01:46:10,597 --> 01:46:12,058
DiBenedetto has a question.

966
01:46:25,701 --> 01:46:28,482
So I just wanted to take an opportunity to say thank you as well.

967
01:46:29,851 --> 01:46:31,212
Thank you very much, both of you.

968
01:46:31,252 --> 01:46:31,692
Thank you.

969
01:46:33,073 --> 01:46:34,754
I just want to add one thing.

970
01:46:36,535 --> 01:46:38,436
Thank you so much for acknowledging Ms.

971
01:46:38,476 --> 01:46:38,736
Chen.

972
01:46:38,756 --> 01:46:40,317
She has worked incredibly hard.

973
01:46:40,457 --> 01:46:42,738
Only last year I did it because Ms.

974
01:46:42,798 --> 01:46:49,521
Chen's sister was going through some health issues and we lost her eventually.

975
01:46:50,102 --> 01:46:51,963
So that was the only time that Ms.

976
01:46:52,003 --> 01:46:53,484
Chen has not been the advisor.

977
01:46:53,544 --> 01:46:54,284
But other than that,

978
01:46:54,664 --> 01:46:56,426
She has been doing an amazing job.

979
01:46:56,486 --> 01:46:59,129
She puts in immense amount of volunteer hours.

980
01:46:59,169 --> 01:47:00,730
So thank you for acknowledging.

981
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:01,651
Thank you very much.

982
01:47:05,174 --> 01:47:05,695
Very nice.

983
01:47:07,857 --> 01:47:12,181
Item 4, report on advanced placement curriculum honor for Medford High School.

984
01:47:13,923 --> 01:47:14,123
Ms.

985
01:47:14,143 --> 01:47:14,784
Caldwell, please.

986
01:47:16,426 --> 01:47:28,393
The Medford Public School has been named to the ninth annual AP District Honor Roll, which recognizes schools that increase access to and performance on advanced placement programs.

987
01:47:29,093 --> 01:47:34,497
Only 373 school districts around the United States and Canada were selected for this honor.

988
01:47:35,257 --> 01:47:47,261
The AP District Honor Roll is administered by the Advanced Placement Program, which enables willing and academically prepared students to pursue college-level studies while still in high school.

989
01:47:47,881 --> 01:47:54,744
The program consists of college-level courses developed by the AP program that high schools can choose to offer.

990
01:47:55,404 --> 01:47:58,465
Corresponding exams are administered once a year.

991
01:47:59,165 --> 01:48:04,407
The AP District Honor Roll recognizes schools that are committed to increasing access to AP

992
01:48:05,207 --> 01:48:14,911
for underrepresented students while simultaneously maintaining or increasing the percentage of students earning AP exam scores of 3 or higher.

993
01:48:15,732 --> 01:48:26,837
The distinction of being named to this honor roll means Medford is committed to expanding the availability of AP courses among prepared and motivated students of all backgrounds.

994
01:48:27,786 --> 01:48:46,698
Medford High School has increased the number of students participating in advanced placement courses over the past three years, while also increasing or maintaining the percentage of students earning scores of three or higher on AP exams.

995
01:48:47,258 --> 01:48:56,804
Per the college board, reaching these goals shows that Medford is to successfully motivating and academically, thank you, preparing students who are ready for AP.

996
01:48:57,820 --> 01:49:12,929
Medford was one of 19 total schools recognized in Massachusetts, which included Brookline, Natick, Newburyport, Pembroke, Linfield, Shrewsbury, Mattapoisette, Norwell, Menden, Marshfield, Lunenburg, South Deerfield,

997
01:49:13,463 --> 01:49:17,526
Ternus Falls, Belchertown, Kingston, South Hadley, and Westborough.

998
01:49:18,227 --> 01:49:26,253
And as you know, in the state of Massachusetts, we have approximately 354 districts right here in Massachusetts.

999
01:49:26,634 --> 01:49:28,936
So this is quite an honor for Medford High School.

1000
01:49:28,956 --> 01:49:29,396
Wonderful.

1001
01:49:32,839 --> 01:49:33,299
Very nice.

1002
01:49:33,319 --> 01:49:37,443
There's a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

1003
01:49:37,463 --> 01:49:38,964
Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Rousseau.

1004
01:49:38,984 --> 01:49:39,564
All those in favor?

1005
01:49:39,584 --> 01:49:39,644
Aye.

1006
01:49:40,205 --> 01:49:40,805
All those opposed?

1007
01:49:40,845 --> 01:49:41,486
Motion passes.

1008
01:49:42,823 --> 01:49:46,366
Item five, recommendation to approve FOSS science curriculum.

1009
01:49:46,886 --> 01:49:47,147
Ms.

1010
01:49:47,207 --> 01:49:47,767
Patterson.

1011
01:49:48,808 --> 01:49:59,837
So this is just a revisit to the original approval back on October 1st, but it was important to make sure that everybody understood the cost impact of this.

1012
01:49:59,937 --> 01:50:04,601
It has increased based on the number of required items needed.

1013
01:50:05,061 --> 01:50:11,587
So the new timeline that we have been negotiating with the company is a three-year payment term.

1014
01:50:12,182 --> 01:50:18,525
We did get, we're still fine tuning the legal terminology within the contract, but year one would be $139,326.

1015
01:50:18,585 --> 01:50:19,485
Year two and three would be $69,663.

1016
01:50:19,525 --> 01:50:23,147
So that would provide us the opportunity to begin the training, get the materials now to roll this out for fiscal year 19-20.

1017
01:50:23,167 --> 01:50:24,287
So the revised quote came in at $278,652.

1018
01:50:41,811 --> 01:50:48,272
which we are requesting to proceed and recommend this additional amount.

1019
01:50:49,373 --> 01:50:50,813
So moved by Mr. Benedetto.

1020
01:50:50,873 --> 01:50:51,993
Is there a second by Ms.

1021
01:50:52,033 --> 01:50:52,413
Kretz?

1022
01:50:52,613 --> 01:50:53,734
Roll call vote.

1023
01:50:53,754 --> 01:50:54,754
Mr. Russo has a question.

1024
01:50:55,674 --> 01:50:56,294
Mr. Russo.

1025
01:50:57,654 --> 01:50:59,395
What does SRB option mean?

1026
01:50:59,755 --> 01:51:01,035
I see it mentioned a few times.

1027
01:51:03,436 --> 01:51:08,877
It's on page 103 on the right under bonus, then there's requires SRB option.

1028
01:51:11,628 --> 01:51:12,809
It's not so obvious today.

1029
01:51:14,911 --> 01:51:18,334
Are you referring to just the shipping costs?

1030
01:51:18,794 --> 01:51:20,456
Requires SRB option.

1031
01:51:23,759 --> 01:51:30,565
So that would be something that Rocco Sieri would have identified as needed for the components.

1032
01:51:30,585 --> 01:51:32,847
So the complete kits, the teacher materials,

1033
01:51:33,438 --> 01:51:36,499
the living materials, and the miscellaneous items.

1034
01:51:36,559 --> 01:51:40,840
So that would be all inclusive of what the packet would entail.

1035
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:45,841
I apologize, I don't know the science acronym for that particular area.

1036
01:51:46,182 --> 01:51:47,122
I'll get it later.

1037
01:51:47,682 --> 01:51:47,862
Ms.

1038
01:51:47,922 --> 01:51:48,342
Mustone.

1039
01:51:49,743 --> 01:51:53,143
Just to make sure, we will have these books for September.

1040
01:51:54,664 --> 01:51:58,665
The intent is that they will be shipped out for the spring for training.

1041
01:51:59,139 --> 01:51:59,639
This spring?

1042
01:51:59,979 --> 01:52:00,199
Yes.

1043
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:02,500
Great, so full rollout September 2019.

1044
01:52:02,540 --> 01:52:03,401
Yes, full rollout.

1045
01:52:03,481 --> 01:52:04,341
Great, thank you.

1046
01:52:04,721 --> 01:52:04,942
Ms.

1047
01:52:04,962 --> 01:52:05,382
Patterson.

1048
01:52:06,762 --> 01:52:07,203
Very good.

1049
01:52:07,803 --> 01:52:08,843
Thank you very much.

1050
01:52:09,023 --> 01:52:10,324
There's a motion on the floor.

1051
01:52:10,464 --> 01:52:11,224
Roll call vote, Ms.

1052
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:11,524
Kretz.

1053
01:52:11,925 --> 01:52:12,325
Ms.

1054
01:52:12,425 --> 01:52:12,745
DeMantek.

1055
01:52:12,965 --> 01:52:13,205
Yes.

1056
01:52:13,865 --> 01:52:13,965
Ms.

1057
01:52:13,985 --> 01:52:14,226
Kretz, yes.

1058
01:52:14,246 --> 01:52:14,306
Ms.

1059
01:52:14,466 --> 01:52:15,046
Mustone.

1060
01:52:15,326 --> 01:52:15,586
Yes.

1061
01:52:15,906 --> 01:52:16,086
Ms.

1062
01:52:16,106 --> 01:52:16,587
Turgell.

1063
01:52:16,767 --> 01:52:17,547
Yes.

1064
01:52:17,587 --> 01:52:18,127
Mr. Mustone.

1065
01:52:18,147 --> 01:52:18,327
Yes.

1066
01:52:19,028 --> 01:52:19,268
Ms.

1067
01:52:19,328 --> 01:52:19,628
McNeil.

1068
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:20,228
Yes.

1069
01:52:20,688 --> 01:52:20,968
Ma'am Rowe.

1070
01:52:21,289 --> 01:52:21,549
Yes.

1071
01:52:21,609 --> 01:52:23,189
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1072
01:52:23,229 --> 01:52:23,950
Motion passes.

1073
01:52:26,051 --> 01:52:26,211
Ms.

1074
01:52:26,231 --> 01:52:26,611
Mustone.

1075
01:52:27,617 --> 01:52:31,759
Just rereading my notes, I made an oversight at our Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee.

1076
01:52:31,979 --> 01:52:38,922
Officer Bill Mazzacca was present, and I do feel remiss if I don't say that I appreciate his input at that meeting as well.

1077
01:52:39,462 --> 01:52:39,702
Thank you.

1078
01:52:39,722 --> 01:52:40,463
Thank you very much.

1079
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:47,866
Under New Business, School Committee Resolution.

1080
01:52:48,526 --> 01:52:48,986
Mayor Burke.

1081
01:52:49,447 --> 01:52:50,027
Mr. Rousseau.

1082
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,761
I would like to ask a question perhaps of Ms.

1083
01:52:56,781 --> 01:53:02,222
Patterson about our MSBA application.

1084
01:53:02,462 --> 01:53:02,802
Oh, sure.

1085
01:53:03,582 --> 01:53:08,183
Do we get feedback or do they just simply give us a no?

1086
01:53:08,983 --> 01:53:13,144
Like is there something about our application they dislike or think that we can do differently?

1087
01:53:13,284 --> 01:53:13,504
No.

1088
01:53:13,844 --> 01:53:18,745
I did call MSBA directly and inquired if there was something

1089
01:53:21,205 --> 01:53:26,130
terminology that could be more aggressive or make us more needy in that context.

1090
01:53:26,750 --> 01:53:30,313
The short answer is no, that each year it's a new year.

1091
01:53:30,594 --> 01:53:33,016
There are districts that have been filing since 2008.

1092
01:53:33,897 --> 01:53:44,106
It just is a matter of the significant need based on enrollment factors and the conditions of the building of whichever project that they are looking at.

1093
01:53:44,563 --> 01:53:48,564
Again, the core projects, core projects alone were over 70 projects.

1094
01:53:49,044 --> 01:53:55,046
So only a small amount based on the amount of funding per the state is available.

1095
01:53:55,526 --> 01:54:03,348
There are accelerated projects that are available, but again, those are for roof, boiler, and windows only.

1096
01:54:03,809 --> 01:54:07,610
So that is something to explore down the road, but again, we keep our...

1097
01:54:09,147 --> 01:54:12,991
capital improvement listing, and we can certainly update it and address it.

1098
01:54:13,091 --> 01:54:17,395
We did fine tune it based on the merger of the vocational and high school this year.

1099
01:54:17,855 --> 01:54:23,200
We will, again, go out for the application period that opens at the end of January.

1100
01:54:23,661 --> 01:54:28,005
Submissions typically go in for February, March, and April.

1101
01:54:29,299 --> 01:54:29,419
Ms.

1102
01:54:29,579 --> 01:54:31,902
Van de Kloot.

1103
01:54:32,022 --> 01:54:33,504
Yes, just one question on that.

1104
01:54:33,684 --> 01:54:40,592
One of the concerns that was brought to us is the heating in the gym, and I've always been concerned about the windows.

1105
01:54:41,092 --> 01:54:44,156
Have we included those in our submission?

1106
01:54:44,376 --> 01:54:44,556
Yes.

1107
01:54:46,458 --> 01:54:49,040
And again, that's the core program.

1108
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:51,702
That wasn't a separate application just for the windows.

1109
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:52,262
Correct.

1110
01:54:52,462 --> 01:54:53,323
So we have to look.

1111
01:54:53,783 --> 01:54:54,043
Right.

1112
01:54:54,143 --> 01:54:57,645
And the heating is really infrastructure.

1113
01:54:57,846 --> 01:54:59,266
It's the HVAC system.

1114
01:54:59,327 --> 01:55:01,428
So that is a significant cost.

1115
01:55:02,088 --> 01:55:04,390
So we're going to be looking at that.

1116
01:55:04,410 --> 01:55:06,351
We do have new boilers that we put in three, four years ago.

1117
01:55:06,471 --> 01:55:06,911
Correct.

1118
01:55:07,232 --> 01:55:07,932
Not the boilers.

1119
01:55:08,573 --> 01:55:09,133
Yeah, right.

1120
01:55:10,474 --> 01:55:12,675
The handlers and all those other gadgets.

1121
01:55:14,857 --> 01:55:15,037
Ms.

1122
01:55:15,057 --> 01:55:15,377
Bustone.

1123
01:55:16,046 --> 01:55:18,126
Any of the 14 school districts that were funded?

1124
01:55:18,967 --> 01:55:20,967
The 12 will be listed.

1125
01:55:21,187 --> 01:55:21,487
They will?

1126
01:55:21,607 --> 01:55:21,847
Yes.

1127
01:55:22,187 --> 01:55:22,507
Okay.

1128
01:55:23,507 --> 01:55:24,188
Thank you.

1129
01:55:27,648 --> 01:55:33,249
Under new business, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Julie Green.

1130
01:55:33,830 --> 01:55:34,010
Ms.

1131
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:38,490
Green was the sister of State Representative Christine Barber, representing Medford and Somerville.

1132
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:40,891
If we could all please rise for a moment of silence, please.

1133
01:55:54,692 --> 01:56:15,968
motion to adjourn this meeting I want to wish everyone a wonderful holiday season happy new year we'll see you back though I think the second week of January we're back I think so second week because it's New Year's Eve is the first yeah yeah so enjoy everyone stay safe and look forward to seeing you next year
