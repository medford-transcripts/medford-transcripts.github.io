00:47:06,035 --> 00:47:18,027
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to make sure that my colleagues knew that MASC's annual day on the hill is on May 6, which is a Tuesday.

50
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:24,113
[SPEAKER_12]: It starts at the UMass club downtown at 9am and

51
00:47:27,855 --> 00:47:33,236
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some speeches from folks from MASC and from the state legislature.

52
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:37,157
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually, often students are in attendance from Medford.

53
00:47:37,817 --> 00:47:48,019
[SPEAKER_12]: And then everyone is invited over to the state house to the Great Hall for lunch, which is put on by students from vocational programs across the state.

54
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,019
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's actually like a super cool event.

55
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:53,360
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if our culinary team ever participates, but

56
00:47:54,840 --> 00:48:00,663
[SPEAKER_12]: And then typically our delegation invites us to dine with them.

57
00:48:00,883 --> 00:48:05,125
[SPEAKER_12]: We all grab lunch and I always find those conversations really interesting.

58
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:08,147
[SPEAKER_12]: So you register on the MASC website.

59
00:48:09,788 --> 00:48:15,831
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm planning to go unless my schedule gets in the way, but it's always sort of a fun, interesting time.

60
00:48:16,171 --> 00:48:20,173
[SPEAKER_12]: And hearing from students from other communities is always very cool too.

61
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:22,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

62
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:25,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Graham.

64
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:49,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion for approval of our consent agenda?

65
00:48:53,198 --> 00:48:57,545
[SPEAKER_11]: by member and tapa seconded by member of a party.

66
00:48:58,386 --> 00:49:01,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, those in favor, do we have money in there.

67
00:49:03,414 --> 00:49:04,696
[SPEAKER_11]: No, sorry.

68
00:49:04,756 --> 00:49:07,500
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed, motion passes.

69
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:25,276
[SPEAKER_11]: And we do not have any reports of subcommittee, we do have a number of reports from our superintendent presentation of the governor's citation to miss Jennifer skein, our principal of the Andrews Middle School, I'm going to turn over to Dr. Suzanne Lucy, our interim superintendent.

70
00:49:27,237 --> 00:49:28,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

71
00:49:28,497 --> 00:49:29,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, everyone.

72
00:49:30,917 --> 00:49:32,938
[SPEAKER_08]: For, I would like to

73
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:34,530
[SPEAKER_08]: ask Ms.

74
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:36,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Skane to just come to the podium.

75
00:49:36,231 --> 00:49:42,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give just a brief overview as to why we are honoring Principal Skane here this evening.

76
00:49:43,294 --> 00:49:53,938
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the morning of Tuesday, February 11th, a small fire broke out in one of the first floor bathrooms of her middle school, the Andrews Middle School.

77
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:58,139
[SPEAKER_08]: When alerted of the situation, she quickly

78
00:50:00,692 --> 00:50:13,779
[SPEAKER_08]: After the fire started miss gain quickly grabbed the nearby fire extinguisher and immediately entered the bathroom to extinguish the flames without even knowing the size of the fire simultaneously.

79
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:19,662
[SPEAKER_08]: She also ordered the safe evacuation of her building.

80
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:25,743
[SPEAKER_08]: by giving her staff very clear directions and staff and students proceeded to the McGlynn.

81
00:50:26,844 --> 00:50:29,586
[SPEAKER_08]: No one was hurt or affected by that incident.

82
00:50:30,207 --> 00:50:31,288
[SPEAKER_08]: She remained on scene.

83
00:50:31,348 --> 00:50:34,030
[SPEAKER_08]: She sent her school with the assistant principal.

84
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:41,596
[SPEAKER_08]: She remained on scene to handle the situation that was ongoing and the subsequent investigation.

85
00:50:42,617 --> 00:50:43,818
[SPEAKER_08]: She also ordered

86
00:50:44,651 --> 00:51:01,225
[SPEAKER_08]: And worked very collaboratively with myself and our communications director will pitch Ellie for all communication to caregivers and the community, as well as her staff, everybody was completely notified about their child's safety and the situation at hand.

87
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:14,408
[SPEAKER_08]: And she very well and professionally collaborated with the Medford Fire Department, the Medford Police Department, the Board of Health, as well as central leadership that was there.

88
00:51:16,048 --> 00:51:25,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And there really was, the students were safe all day and there was very minimal disruption, not just that day, but also that week to the learning.

89
00:51:26,831 --> 00:51:35,276
[SPEAKER_08]: And so Dr. Cushing and myself worked on the citation through the governor's office, Governor Healey.

90
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:45,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And so before we kind of go through the citation, I would like to give Principal Skane the opportunity to maybe just say a few words about that day.

91
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Galusi.

92
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:54,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I can say is that it was not a individual effort by any means.

93
00:51:55,325 --> 00:52:05,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt very grateful that one phone call to Dr. Galusi and Will, and they were there within five minutes communicating to families.

94
00:52:06,553 --> 00:52:13,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Within, I think we determined it was eight minutes, all students were evacuated from the building and at the McGlynn.

95
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:14,138
[SPEAKER_05]: So

96
00:52:15,259 --> 00:52:29,333
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day, the students really their feedback was it was really a boring day so if you can have that much excitement and chaos and the students feedback it was kind of boring I guess we did some things right.

97
00:52:30,754 --> 00:52:31,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say that.

98
00:52:33,136 --> 00:52:35,518
[SPEAKER_05]: This was not a singular effort.

99
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:43,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick Tucci, I picked up the phone I said my entire school is on the way to your building and he said, bring them on.

100
00:52:44,343 --> 00:52:50,047
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was nice to have that opportunity, as well as parents who were super.

101
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:56,754
[SPEAKER_05]: helpful and helped keep their kids calm the students were really calm.

102
00:52:57,335 --> 00:53:07,586
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the food services we've got amazing feedback from the students that they think that we went out of our way to make them some special food that day.

103
00:53:09,268 --> 00:53:21,698
[SPEAKER_05]: They served six lunches in the time that they traditionally do three plus they fed our entire staff at Andrews Middle School so that was a huge momentous task and they did a great job.

104
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:30,265
[SPEAKER_05]: So truly, thank you, but I can't say that I did this alone, my staff stepped up every single one of them.

105
00:53:31,205 --> 00:53:39,288
[SPEAKER_05]: We had been working on some new fire emergency evacuation procedures and what we discovered is they worked amazingly well.

106
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:49,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll continue to, as a staff and as a building, you know, communicate how do we do these things effectively, but I think we did pretty well that day.

107
00:53:49,653 --> 00:53:50,293
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

108
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:51,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

109
00:53:53,334 --> 00:53:54,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you, Ms.

110
00:53:54,034 --> 00:53:54,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Skane.

111
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:59,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I was on the phone with Dr. Galussi after the incident happened and

112
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:09,459
[SPEAKER_11]: what she explained that you did for our school and our students and our staff going in there like a firefighter yourself is very impressive.

113
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:10,400
[SPEAKER_11]: It just shows the

114
00:54:11,043 --> 00:54:15,267
[SPEAKER_11]: You have that part of your brain, they say, that it's just response, response, response.

115
00:54:16,067 --> 00:54:17,048
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for all you did.

116
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a citation from the governor's office.

117
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:21,112
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll just read it.

118
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:36,825
[SPEAKER_11]: Commonwealth of Massachusetts to Principal Jennifer Skane, on behalf of the residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am pleased to confer upon you this governor's citation in recognition of your heroic efforts to protect the students and staff of the Andrews Middle School.

119
00:54:37,265 --> 00:54:39,247
[SPEAKER_11]: We commend your quick thinking and resolve

120
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:43,452
[SPEAKER_11]: to immediately extinguish a growing fire and prevent a larger catastrophe.

121
00:54:44,113 --> 00:54:51,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Your bravery and fast action are a testament to your true leadership and strength of character as principal of the Andrews Middle School.

122
00:54:51,919 --> 00:54:53,080
[SPEAKER_11]: The Commonwealth thanks you."

123
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:59,706
[SPEAKER_11]: And this was signed the 24th day of March, 2025 by Lieutenant Governor Driscoll and Governor Healey.

124
00:55:00,207 --> 00:55:01,708
[SPEAKER_11]: So congratulations and thank you.

125
00:55:12,641 --> 00:55:13,931
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems Will might want a picture.

126
00:56:28,152 --> 00:56:35,360
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, we have the overview of search processes for Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Director of EL Openings.

127
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,565
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to again turn it over to Dr. Galusi, our Interim Superintendent.

128
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:43,677
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

129
00:56:43,697 --> 00:56:46,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, thank you Dr. Cushing.

130
00:56:48,260 --> 00:57:00,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So many of you may have seen in last Friday's memo I did highlight a lot of this work that we have in the district but I felt it was very important to also make sure that we mentioned it at this meeting here.

131
00:57:01,566 --> 00:57:02,667
[SPEAKER_08]: for the greater community.

132
00:57:02,767 --> 00:57:08,953
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have two very key pivotal roles at central office that need to be filled.

133
00:57:10,394 --> 00:57:14,677
[SPEAKER_08]: One of course was the one that I sat in for the assistant superintendent of academics and instruction.

134
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:18,621
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other one is for the director of the English learner department.

135
00:57:19,521 --> 00:57:29,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul Texera has held that position for a number of years, but he was most recently named as the next superintendent for the Provincetown school department.

136
00:57:30,016 --> 00:57:37,905
[SPEAKER_08]: And so he will, his employment with Medford Public Schools will be sadly coming to an end on June 30th.

137
00:57:38,425 --> 00:57:44,832
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's very important that we just highlight what that process is going to look like for both of these key roles.

138
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:48,416
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to make sure,

139
00:57:49,395 --> 00:58:01,637
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a greater understanding the position of the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction has that vertical view of teaching and learning for the district from pre-K to grade 12 and beyond.

140
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:15,600
[SPEAKER_08]: They play an important role in shaping curriculum decisions, instructional decisions, and works very, very closely with our department leads as well as school leadership and central administration.

141
00:58:17,142 --> 00:58:25,344
[SPEAKER_08]: making sure that we are grounded by our instructional vision and that our students are given the high quality education they deserve.

142
00:58:26,244 --> 00:58:33,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Our director of English learners supports the diverse population of all of our students where English is their second language.

143
00:58:34,205 --> 00:58:42,227
[SPEAKER_08]: They work in planning and developing and coordinating their delivery of educational instruction that supports the EL needs.

144
00:58:43,067 --> 00:59:00,922
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a key position that works closely pretty much with all administrative positions and educator types positions across the district, as well as building strong family community partnerships within that population and broadly.

145
00:59:02,173 --> 00:59:10,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to make sure that the process is thorough and that we're reaching out to a varied number of stakeholders.

146
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:18,544
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the importance of collaboration is key in this process and with the school and district communities.

147
00:59:19,705 --> 00:59:29,031
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are, as you saw in the Friday memo, we have sent out a letter and we have sent out two surveys.

148
00:59:30,556 --> 00:59:31,477
[SPEAKER_08]: one for each role.

149
00:59:32,198 --> 00:59:36,643
[SPEAKER_08]: We are hoping to have two things for that initial outreach.

150
00:59:37,404 --> 00:59:38,505
[SPEAKER_08]: We are looking for interest,

151
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:42,377
[SPEAKER_08]: in people to serve on the search committee.

152
00:59:42,477 --> 00:59:48,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are looking for, again, varied stakeholders from students to caregivers, to staff, to administration.

153
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:53,423
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one for the assistant superintendent and one for the EL director.

154
00:59:54,223 --> 01:00:07,070
[SPEAKER_08]: And within that survey, we also pose some questions to get some initial feedback regarding the qualities that they feel are critical for a candidate to possess for each role.

155
01:00:09,363 --> 01:00:20,899
[SPEAKER_08]: We also will be following up with a greater level of input pertaining to discussions or roundtables or targeted surveys for each particular role.

156
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:28,081
[SPEAKER_08]: for the assistant superintendent for academics and instruction.

157
01:00:29,022 --> 01:00:35,089
[SPEAKER_08]: That will be co-facilitated by myself and Joan Bowen, director of student services.

158
01:00:35,971 --> 01:00:41,197
[SPEAKER_08]: We are just starting to look now through the survey so that we can build what the search committee will look like.

159
01:00:42,158 --> 01:00:59,991
[SPEAKER_08]: And for the director of EL, that will be co-facilitated by Paul Texera and Nancy Sherman-Hudson, principal of the Missituk Elementary School, that houses one of our newcomer programs and has for the past several years since we implemented the newcomer programming.

160
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:10,919
[SPEAKER_08]: And day two, you can see we have a very similar time frame that we are going to conduct for this search process.

161
01:01:12,154 --> 01:01:13,416
[SPEAKER_08]: We have sent out the survey.

162
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:14,899
[SPEAKER_08]: We are monitoring it closely.

163
01:01:14,959 --> 01:01:18,064
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be creating the search committees.

164
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:21,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that better?

165
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:32,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and then we will start the interview cycle.

166
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:48,445
[SPEAKER_08]: The key piece of creating a search committee is for that first round of going through the qualified candidates and doing the first round of interviews before we move on to the final round of interviews.

167
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:52,987
[SPEAKER_08]: I will make sure that we are keeping the community well-informed.

168
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:55,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Once the committee has been formed,

169
01:01:56,288 --> 01:02:04,253
[SPEAKER_08]: we will communicate that to the district so that you are aware of the composition of each search committee.

170
01:02:06,174 --> 01:02:10,777
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are any questions at this time before I move on to my next item.

171
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

172
01:02:16,761 --> 01:02:17,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

173
01:02:18,022 --> 01:02:21,084
[SPEAKER_12]: What role does the school committee play on these committees?

174
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:25,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have an idea about how you want us to be plugged into this?

175
01:02:26,347 --> 01:02:27,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely, yes.

176
01:02:27,187 --> 01:02:36,910
[SPEAKER_08]: So as all of our search processes that we've had to date, there's been a school committee representative on each of the search committees.

177
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:45,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is my intention that that is still going to happen for the assistant superintendent, as well as the director of EL.

178
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:49,973
[SPEAKER_12]: And do you want us to apply using those same links that you sent to us?

179
01:02:49,993 --> 01:02:50,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Please.

180
01:02:50,413 --> 01:02:51,173
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, thank you.

181
01:03:01,574 --> 01:03:14,100
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the same question, but I also wanted to confirm that if somebody has initial feedback on what they're looking for in the role but does not want to serve on the committee they should still answer, they should still respond to that survey.

182
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:25,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I think if you do a second push, it would be really useful to put that in there because I certainly read that as, if you want to be a part of the committee, that's what the survey is for, rather than also feedback.

183
01:03:26,145 --> 01:03:27,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, thank you for that feedback.

184
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:40,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there was, so the original letter that went along with that for both surveys did say that we're looking for interest and input.

185
01:03:40,822 --> 01:03:49,084
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but to be more targeted and clear, we'll follow up with another vehicle for input and feedback.

186
01:03:59,157 --> 01:04:01,038
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, do you want me to go to the next one?

187
01:04:01,078 --> 01:04:01,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, OK.

188
01:04:02,918 --> 01:04:16,482
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so the last report that I have this evening is I've brought forward an update to the policy language for policy IKF regarding the graduation requirements at Medford High School.

189
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:34,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So in an effort to add some additional context and or clarity to the IKF policy, Medford Public Schools would like to update the following language based on stakeholder input and feedback.

190
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:46,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have received some feedback from stakeholders regarding some areas of the current policy that would be most beneficial to add a little bit

191
01:04:46,855 --> 01:04:47,776
[SPEAKER_08]: of clarity to.

192
01:04:48,156 --> 01:04:59,727
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first one is around the introductory language, which I will speak to in a following slide, but that specifically targets the participating students in graduation in the graduation ceremony.

193
01:05:00,968 --> 01:05:07,494
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit more clarity to the math requirements, since the implementation of the pathways just to be very clear by class.

194
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:16,686
[SPEAKER_08]: what the requirements are, and then a little more specificity to students with significant needs.

195
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:25,278
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we go to the next slide that talks about introductory language, one more.

196
01:05:27,471 --> 01:05:28,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

197
01:05:29,252 --> 01:05:45,536
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll see I have highlighted where we've built out a little bit more of the of the clarity, so that we're very clear in who's participating in the graduation, which is all Medford high school students that have received a diploma or a certificate of completion.

198
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:47,757
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to make sure that

199
01:05:48,655 --> 01:05:50,736
[SPEAKER_08]: we're very clear there's an asterisk there.

200
01:05:50,816 --> 01:06:11,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So one of the pieces is that at the bottom where we've kind of had our footnotes, I wanna be clear that we're mentioning that the decisions regarding students in our substantially separate programs are made through the individualized education program process, which is the IEP process.

201
01:06:13,323 --> 01:06:20,086
[SPEAKER_08]: So all students that receive a diploma or a certificate of completion will absolutely participate in graduation.

202
01:06:21,746 --> 01:06:34,731
[SPEAKER_08]: And more specifically, the following outlines the requirements that must be met to receive a diploma, which include a total of 112 required credits and the completion of the competency determination.

203
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:41,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if it's best for me to keep going, or if you would like to ask questions with each

204
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:44,767
[SPEAKER_08]: clarity, which with each clarification.

205
01:06:44,787 --> 01:06:48,411
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no questions right now keep going.

206
01:06:48,451 --> 01:06:56,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll let you know, just the next section, where we were receiving a lot of questions and rightfully so.

207
01:06:57,725 --> 01:07:01,929
[SPEAKER_08]: we have implemented integrated math pathways at the high school.

208
01:07:02,369 --> 01:07:06,513
[SPEAKER_08]: So this just breaks out what the requirements are by class.

209
01:07:06,553 --> 01:07:23,028
[SPEAKER_08]: So for this current class of 2025, next year's class of 2026, and the following year's class of 2027, for our local graduation requirements, they have to pass geometry or integrated math one,

210
01:07:24,053 --> 01:07:30,082
[SPEAKER_08]: in ninth grade and they have to pass algebra two or integrated math two in grade 10.

211
01:07:31,124 --> 01:07:37,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And just as a side note, this was the first year where freshmen entered the integrated math one.

212
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:50,529
[SPEAKER_08]: which is why you'll see for class of 2028 and beyond, it would be that as freshmen, they have to pass integrated math one, CP or honors.

213
01:07:51,469 --> 01:07:56,613
[SPEAKER_08]: And in grade 10, they need to pass integrated math two, CP or honors.

214
01:08:01,135 --> 01:08:04,137
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's a little redundant, but following,

215
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:25,366
[SPEAKER_08]: In the further consideration section within the IKF policy, we just added specifically that students with significant needs, that decisions regarding students in our substantially separate programming are made through the IEP process.

216
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:31,468
[SPEAKER_08]: That is my recommendation.

217
01:08:31,888 --> 01:08:35,189
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have any questions, please let me know.

218
01:08:39,358 --> 01:08:39,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham.

219
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

220
01:08:44,861 --> 01:09:02,529
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to thank the members of the community that reached out to myself and member Reinfeld in particular who asked some good clarifying questions about the math sequence in particular and then some of the clarifications around who gets to participate in graduation because that's

221
01:09:03,149 --> 01:09:14,237
[SPEAKER_12]: obviously super important when we talk about grad requirements, as well as some clarifications around students with IEPs that are sort of directing the graduation requirements a little bit differently.

222
01:09:14,317 --> 01:09:22,462
[SPEAKER_12]: So there were two or three parents that reached out and we were able to have a quick meeting to come up with some clarifying language.

223
01:09:22,582 --> 01:09:29,367
[SPEAKER_12]: I think my question is, does this need to come back to the agenda next week because it is an official policy?

224
01:09:29,447 --> 01:09:30,788
[SPEAKER_12]: So do we

225
01:09:32,093 --> 01:09:58,506
[SPEAKER_11]: make a motion to approve it now and then put it on the agenda for a second reading next meeting yes okay so we'll make a motion to approve this as um as suggested and if i just may ask a question from the chair and then i'll pass it to member and tapa the 60 total hours of community service is that spread out 15 hours and i'm sorry if i'm ideally 15 hours per year ideally

226
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:00,414
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't know.

227
01:10:00,554 --> 01:10:03,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Ideally, but every student has kind of their own course.

228
01:10:03,897 --> 01:10:04,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

229
01:10:04,077 --> 01:10:11,883
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I think to make it more manageable, that's a great way to do it but by the end of the 4 years, they have to have done at least 60 hours.

230
01:10:11,963 --> 01:10:12,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

231
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:13,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

232
01:10:13,725 --> 01:10:14,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Tapa.

233
01:10:14,225 --> 01:10:24,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was just going to say that if there are no other questions from the committee that I can second the motion as written.

234
01:10:25,173 --> 01:10:27,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, the addition of the

235
01:10:27,947 --> 01:10:30,188
[SPEAKER_03]: know, clarification on who will walk at graduation.

236
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:38,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that that is a huge, I'm sure, stressful point for, you know, members of the community who, you know, that may be an issue for us.

237
01:10:38,332 --> 01:10:40,533
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm just, I'm happy to see that that's inclusive.

238
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:43,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Passing of geometry, it's all pretty written out.

239
01:10:44,174 --> 01:10:48,236
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I, if there are no other questions from the committee, then I, it seems like we do.

240
01:10:49,497 --> 01:10:50,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Then afterwards, I'll second the motion.

241
01:10:51,698 --> 01:10:51,978
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

242
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:56,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Member, Member Reinfeld?

243
01:10:58,293 --> 01:11:07,723
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just amend, replace further considerations and next steps with additional considerations, since it's a policy and not on the top of page three.

244
01:11:12,888 --> 01:11:13,829
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not part of the policy?

245
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:15,891
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

246
01:11:16,011 --> 01:11:16,892
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not.

247
01:11:16,932 --> 01:11:17,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe that was a question.

248
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:29,502
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but I think that's why it is repetitive right now, because we made sure that we added this statement to the footnotes that is reflected in the policy.

249
01:11:30,343 --> 01:11:36,010
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess the question is, where is this page three content available for people to view?

250
01:11:38,868 --> 01:11:40,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I can double check on that.

251
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:47,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the original was linked into my letter, but I will double check what is actually posted on the website.

252
01:11:48,633 --> 01:12:00,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think since this addresses questions that the community had about students in particular situations, like transfer students, significant needs, et cetera, it should be available and easy to find place.

253
01:12:01,219 --> 01:12:01,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

254
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:02,820
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor?

255
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:04,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

256
01:12:05,876 --> 01:12:20,224
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually, I'm fine with just adding it to the policy, although I would remove the words further consideration in the next steps and just, and just, or not including the header at all and just all that text minus the header.

257
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:21,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Without the title?

258
01:12:21,664 --> 01:12:21,885
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

259
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:23,866
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine with that.

260
01:12:30,989 --> 01:12:33,871
[SPEAKER_11]: Member, so if you just could repeat that, I was just reading something else.

261
01:12:36,491 --> 01:12:41,213
[SPEAKER_01]: just to strike further considerations and next steps and include that language on that page as part of the policy.

262
01:12:41,853 --> 01:12:44,094
[SPEAKER_01]: This policy is updated every six months anyways.

263
01:12:44,174 --> 01:12:48,756
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just scrap whatever we don't need in October when we review it next.

264
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:53,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Tapa.

265
01:12:54,278 --> 01:12:55,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a quick point of clarification.

266
01:12:55,539 --> 01:13:01,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So on page three, this was something I was actually gonna ask and I completely forgot.

267
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:05,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So last bullet point, former MHS students without CD, is this,

268
01:13:07,753 --> 01:13:09,994
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming this is what this is, but I just want to clarify.

269
01:13:10,034 --> 01:13:19,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is basically saying, if you did not graduate, you can retroactively apply for either a certificate of completion or a diploma, or is it just certificate of completion?

270
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:20,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

271
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:23,242
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are for the students who did not pass MCAS.

272
01:13:23,362 --> 01:13:26,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So they got a certificate of completion and not a diploma.

273
01:13:27,084 --> 01:13:33,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if they would like to go through the steps of getting a diploma, which is just really having us

274
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:37,986
[SPEAKER_08]: look into their transcripts on an individual basis.

275
01:13:38,366 --> 01:13:49,861
[SPEAKER_08]: If they pass the proper coursework that now applies to our CD, our competency determination, then we can go through the process to kind of fix that for them and issue them a diploma.

276
01:13:50,401 --> 01:13:51,483
[SPEAKER_08]: If they did not,

277
01:13:52,833 --> 01:14:03,702
[SPEAKER_08]: let's say pass the coursework, then it also allows us on an individual basis to have a conversation with them about what they could do to accrue those credits and earn a diploma.

278
01:14:03,882 --> 01:14:04,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

279
01:14:04,323 --> 01:14:09,067
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I love to see that because I saw, I believe I'm going to, I'm sorry, I'll talk less loud.

280
01:14:09,267 --> 01:14:09,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't echo.

281
01:14:10,688 --> 01:14:18,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I saw another district within the state or maybe even, yeah, head of the state because we passed the MCATs ruling, like really publicly mentioning this.

282
01:14:18,995 --> 01:14:21,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we have a lot of work to do to work with

283
01:14:21,652 --> 01:14:30,097
[SPEAKER_03]: our MarCom team, as well as our alumni association to really push this and be very clear about, yes, it's an immutable basis, but we'll help you get there.

284
01:14:30,137 --> 01:14:33,199
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way, you know, this is an unfair thing.

285
01:14:33,459 --> 01:14:34,219
[SPEAKER_03]: We're fixing it.

286
01:14:34,699 --> 01:14:36,500
[SPEAKER_03]: The state has entrusted us to fix this.

287
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:40,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's not, like, let's go back and do that.

288
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:43,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to make that very clear in any way we can.

289
01:14:43,664 --> 01:14:44,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

290
01:14:44,965 --> 01:14:46,146
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really nice to see.

291
01:14:46,186 --> 01:14:49,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously I still second the motion on the floor.

292
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:58,952
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a motion for approval as amended before I call the roll or move the motion.

293
01:14:59,032 --> 01:14:59,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinfeld.

294
01:15:00,352 --> 01:15:09,836
[SPEAKER_09]: One more amendment is just to add eligibility for a diploma under the post-2024 requirements so that it's explicit that this is about the diploma.

295
01:15:12,316 --> 01:15:16,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Last bullet point to assess eligibility for a diploma under.

296
01:15:24,714 --> 01:15:26,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Eligibility for a diploma.

297
01:15:30,696 --> 01:15:32,216
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I will stop amending things.

298
01:15:35,517 --> 01:15:36,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you'll get me next week, yeah.

299
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:49,762
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member Rousseau as amended.

300
01:15:49,782 --> 01:15:50,982
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

301
01:15:51,002 --> 01:15:51,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

302
01:15:51,883 --> 01:15:52,683
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

303
01:15:53,601 --> 01:15:54,404
[SPEAKER_11]: paper passes.

304
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:56,271
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

305
01:15:57,756 --> 01:15:57,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

306
01:15:58,599 --> 01:15:59,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I will.

307
01:15:59,221 --> 01:15:59,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

308
01:16:02,189 --> 01:16:17,598
[SPEAKER_11]: We have number four recommendation to approve bond request of the Met of Medford City Council of $25,775,000 for the McGlynn and Andrews HVAC project Dr. Peter J Cushing assistant superintendent.

309
01:16:18,219 --> 01:16:23,942
[SPEAKER_11]: We also have Brenda Pike from planning development sustainability and our director

310
01:16:24,347 --> 01:16:27,129
[SPEAKER_11]: Planning Development sustainability Alicia hunts with us as well.

311
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:28,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for being here everybody.

312
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:29,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

313
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,932
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have our own as project manager Tom.

314
01:16:31,952 --> 01:16:32,192
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

315
01:16:34,574 --> 01:16:47,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for this opportunity to request the last sum of money for this project, and which will be as has been mentioned previously.

316
01:16:48,873 --> 01:16:57,596
[SPEAKER_02]: not only repairing and replacing the equipment that is there, but will also serve as a significant energy reduction for the city.

317
01:16:58,897 --> 01:17:02,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the initial design came to $1.298 million.

318
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:05,119
[SPEAKER_02]: We requested for phase one construction.

319
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:17,596
[SPEAKER_02]: for phase one construction $5 million a bond, which I can't believe that was December, already, it.

320
01:17:18,336 --> 01:17:30,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to actually go back because it didn't feel that long ago, and requested $5 million for pre purchase through some really heroic efforts of our design team

321
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:38,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda, Paul Riggi, Alicia, Tom, and many other people really working on this project, which is a sprint.

322
01:17:38,934 --> 01:17:51,261
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to make sure that we get this work done in time, a lot of complicated pieces from procurement to design and funding all have to fall in place very well.

323
01:17:51,562 --> 01:17:53,263
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the work is moving forward.

324
01:17:54,784 --> 01:18:04,831
[SPEAKER_02]: and frequent meetings, frequent reviews and frequent visits to the schools as well to make sure that this project is on target and moving well.

325
01:18:05,812 --> 01:18:14,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So that $5 million work and the pre-purchase was submitted this past Friday successfully, right?

326
01:18:14,759 --> 01:18:22,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So that equipment can be built in time to be delivered onsite and hoisted into position prior to school starting.

327
01:18:23,825 --> 01:18:24,486
[SPEAKER_02]: fingers crossed.

328
01:18:27,129 --> 01:18:30,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions on phase one, which we've discussed extensively previous.

329
01:18:31,815 --> 01:18:32,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Our construction budget.

330
01:18:35,017 --> 01:18:36,038
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in in the neighborhood of $22,945,533.

331
01:18:36,138 --> 01:18:37,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Total construction costs $19,279,000.

332
01:18:37,459 --> 01:18:39,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Our owner's construction contingency is just shy of $700,000 at $687,000.

333
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:44,383
[SPEAKER_02]: The designer through construction costs to make sure the designs if need to be updated, anything along those lines, $1.3 million.

334
01:18:44,403 --> 01:18:44,463
[SPEAKER_02]: OPM,

335
01:19:03,082 --> 01:19:20,507
[SPEAKER_02]: JLL through construction 484,000 just want to mention our designer B2Q previously mentioned that and our owner contingency that is not considered in the gross maximum price GMP stands for gross maximum price when you have construction manager at risk.

336
01:19:21,387 --> 01:19:46,828
[SPEAKER_02]: uh everything has to be they're involved in the design process and everything has to be baked in in this final gross maximum price so uh not considered there anything you'd like to add at this time brenda not to this section to the to the other cost definitely okay so other costs why don't you take that away then sure um so yeah so we have we're calling this under

337
01:19:48,811 --> 01:20:05,242
[SPEAKER_06]: All these other things underneath that we're putting under other costs but there are things that are required for this project to happen, including commissioning of the new equipment 500,000 ADA upgrades that the new, the new project is triggering.

338
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:10,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have included six around $619,000 for ADA upgrades including.

339
01:20:14,627 --> 01:20:27,512
[SPEAKER_06]: the leveling of the entrance at McGlynn, and some other ADA upgrades that are, we consider really useful and not too costly.

340
01:20:29,243 --> 01:20:36,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are another just want to highlight for you there's another $2.3 million in Ada upgrades that we do not consider useful.

341
01:20:38,349 --> 01:20:51,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And are too costly for this project, and so our consultant based on their past experience thinks that for those upgrades, we will be able to get variances from the state and so.

342
01:20:52,585 --> 01:20:56,268
[SPEAKER_06]: April and May, we'll be applying for those variances and getting those approved.

343
01:20:56,468 --> 01:21:01,371
[SPEAKER_06]: We fully expect that we will get them, but I just wanted to mention that that's happening.

344
01:21:04,734 --> 01:21:14,821
[SPEAKER_06]: We're including the cost of the IT room HVAC equipment replacement for these two schools in this project.

345
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:21,546
[SPEAKER_06]: The other three schools, IT room equipment is being handled separately from this.

346
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:27,659
[SPEAKER_06]: This includes refurbishment of the McGlynn roof, not full replacement, just refurbishment.

347
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanna point out that while we're considering that we fully expect that we will get massive incentives for around $2.2 million, we do have to authorize spending upfront for that.

348
01:21:42,585 --> 01:21:45,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's a reimbursement that we'll get some months later.

349
01:21:46,226 --> 01:21:51,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we had been talking about including solar potentially as an add alternate for this project.

350
01:21:52,449 --> 01:22:04,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now we're not including it as part of the project, because of the cost of it, but there's the possibility if we do come in significantly under cost, then we could add solar on the roof.

351
01:22:05,973 --> 01:22:13,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a distinct possibility because we do have a lot of our regular construction and owner contingencies included as part of this.

352
01:22:13,977 --> 01:22:33,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also another more than $2 million of contingencies built in for possible tariffs and possible second shift work in case there are delays that will create a time crunch so that we need to do a lot of second shift work in order to get this done by the time students are coming in.

353
01:22:36,728 --> 01:22:39,310
[SPEAKER_02]: We're obviously hoping to avoid any second shift work.

354
01:22:40,111 --> 01:22:45,354
[SPEAKER_02]: We have already made plans internally to move programming elsewhere in the district.

355
01:22:46,856 --> 01:22:57,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And just want to make sure that everyone knows that the ADA upgrades get triggered when any single project goes over 30% of the value of the buildings.

356
01:22:58,544 --> 01:22:59,684
[SPEAKER_02]: or the assessed value.

357
01:23:00,744 --> 01:23:10,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And the pieces that are not being addressed in this and that we are seeking variances for are literally a matter of inches.

358
01:23:10,886 --> 01:23:23,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving entire door frames for every classroom forward or backwards an inch or two to be in code compliance or moving a toilet from 17 inches to 18 inches to be in the

359
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:32,732
[SPEAKER_02]: the benefit is not there to spend the $2.3 million.

360
01:23:33,173 --> 01:23:45,279
[SPEAKER_02]: We are addressing the most severe and egregious upgrades that are required and we'll do everything we can to make sure that our buildings are compliant.

361
01:23:45,639 --> 01:23:52,283
[SPEAKER_02]: But these variances are seen by the code consultants as well within the realm of acceptability.

362
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:56,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to take any questions.

363
01:23:59,312 --> 01:24:00,193
[SPEAKER_11]: From the chair, if I may.

364
01:24:00,213 --> 01:24:12,376
[SPEAKER_11]: The potential solar option, can you explain those options down the line, whether it be purchasing or is there an option to lease like homeowners have?

365
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:16,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda, you are the best.

366
01:24:16,958 --> 01:24:23,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so there is the option to lease, to have a power purchase agreement, which is something that we have on the DPW.

367
01:24:25,131 --> 01:24:27,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So that that is an option for the future.

368
01:24:28,393 --> 01:24:35,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say the best value in terms of the, you know, getting the benefit from the solar is if you own it yourself.

369
01:24:36,175 --> 01:24:40,417
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's, you know, a decision you have to make, depending on the upfront capital available.

370
01:24:41,432 --> 01:24:53,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, and I asked that and hopefully there'll be a team decision down the line, even if we don't come in under because of the tariffs and the second, potentially the potential second shift.

371
01:24:53,563 --> 01:24:57,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Because just to point out, this is a massive, massive job.

372
01:24:57,587 --> 01:25:07,796
[SPEAKER_11]: This is over 30 million that we're gonna be going out to bond with, although there are some discussions behind the scene about potential use of some free cash to bring this down.

373
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:16,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Because when we hit fiscal year 27 this is a $1.8 million hit on our budget for return principal and interest.

374
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:26,547
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a 1.8 million we're going to have to find on the city and city slash school budget that is already pretty constrained.

375
01:25:27,307 --> 01:25:28,708
[SPEAKER_11]: Just want to point that point that out.

376
01:25:29,249 --> 01:25:30,669
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully it could be a group decision.

377
01:25:31,010 --> 01:25:31,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

378
01:25:39,619 --> 01:25:40,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Reinfeld?

379
01:25:42,141 --> 01:25:43,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, then Member Reinfeld.

380
01:25:45,022 --> 01:25:45,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

381
01:25:46,843 --> 01:25:54,328
[SPEAKER_12]: In terms of the solar at alternate, I think it would be helpful for us to know what the payoff is, right?

382
01:25:54,408 --> 01:26:06,235
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it would cost $1.2 million to put solar on the roof, at what point is the payoff there so that we are making wise financial decisions for the

383
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:20,573
[SPEAKER_12]: life of the project instead of just in the right now so I'm, I'm happy to make a motion but I would just like somebody to give us that break that financial breakdown of what does this look like if we do it.

384
01:26:21,354 --> 01:26:23,136
[SPEAKER_12]: And what could we expect in terms of.

385
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:33,245
[SPEAKER_12]: lisasmith PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her-hers): Electrical savings that kind of thing I know it's like imperfect and it's a moving target i'm looking for something that can give us like a payback period.

386
01:26:33,265 --> 01:26:43,469
[SPEAKER_12]: lisasmith PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her-hers): So that we could predict like could the could are there multiple ways to fund this this addition, so that we can get the best benefit from it.

387
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:47,471
[SPEAKER_06]: lisasmith PB, Lupita D Montoya PB, she-her-hers): yeah before moving forward with something like that we would we would want to show the.

388
01:26:48,192 --> 01:27:01,254
[SPEAKER_12]: the payoffs based on Oh, I'm asking you to provide me the payoff, like regardless like of a decision to move forward, I would like this committee to know what that is, so that we can weigh in on that priority.

389
01:27:02,370 --> 01:27:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: We can definitely do that.

390
01:27:04,431 --> 01:27:10,614
[SPEAKER_02]: One, we did also explore the terminal units in each classroom from an energy perspective.

391
01:27:10,854 --> 01:27:16,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe the payoff was 347 years for the terminal units.

392
01:27:16,676 --> 01:27:17,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't have to do with solar.

393
01:27:17,817 --> 01:27:27,641
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are looking at every possible cost savings opportunity to make sure that we are desperately trying to keep costs down.

394
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:31,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And we recognize this is a necessary

395
01:27:32,959 --> 01:27:35,902
[SPEAKER_02]: upgrade or upgrade, I mean replacement.

396
01:27:36,123 --> 01:27:38,165
[SPEAKER_02]: The buildings are approaching 25 years old.

397
01:27:40,067 --> 01:27:40,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

398
01:27:41,749 --> 01:27:42,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld.

399
01:27:43,563 --> 01:27:44,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, my question was related.

400
01:27:45,283 --> 01:27:48,004
[SPEAKER_09]: You said this could be added on if we see costs are coming down.

401
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:55,505
[SPEAKER_09]: If we, say, decide that we want to do this, is this estimate going significant?

402
01:27:55,785 --> 01:28:00,006
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we cannot always predict what the markets are going to do, et cetera, et cetera.

403
01:28:00,346 --> 01:28:06,027
[SPEAKER_09]: But is there a significant risk in waiting to do a solar addition?

404
01:28:06,047 --> 01:28:06,567
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good question.

405
01:28:21,828 --> 01:28:27,035
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'm trying to avoid is six months from now going, oh, we should have authorized this six months ago, for example.

406
01:28:29,385 --> 01:28:30,285
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

407
01:28:31,746 --> 01:28:39,350
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had asked us this question a year ago, we could give you sort of a like, well, here's where the market is going and why we think things might go up and down.

408
01:28:40,631 --> 01:28:44,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the state of the world right now, we have no clue.

409
01:28:44,373 --> 01:28:55,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Because six months ago, we thought we could get a 30% back from federal government with what's called direct pay, which is the tax credit that people can get.

410
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:06,508
[SPEAKER_00]: While I think that literally today that might still exist, I'm not betting on that existing in like a week or two, you know, like that's how nuts things are right now.

411
01:29:07,068 --> 01:29:14,034
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the tariffs, they're trying to move the construction of solar panels to the US so that might actually help.

412
01:29:14,472 --> 01:29:22,234
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be okay, but there are rare earth minerals that they have to get from China and, you know, 50% increase on those costs.

413
01:29:22,594 --> 01:29:28,356
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, who knows where things will stand three months from now, let alone six months or a year.

414
01:29:28,756 --> 01:29:34,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, my hope is that in two years, things will be kind of a little bit stable again.

415
01:29:34,497 --> 01:29:36,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And then things would just be a reasonable, like,

416
01:29:37,598 --> 01:29:38,619
[SPEAKER_00]: costs on these things.

417
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:39,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

418
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:50,848
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I feel like it had to just be said that for most of this we we kind of we have things we're locking stuff in whatever that just feels like it's just I don't know how to predict something like that.

419
01:29:51,028 --> 01:29:57,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you and I appreciate locking things in because this has to get done before our kids go back to school in the fall.

420
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,394
[SPEAKER_09]: This has to happen over the summer so

421
01:29:59,494 --> 01:30:10,484
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I feel like this committee does know, but we just should say for people who are known, the reason we're only talking about solar on the McGlynn is because we have contracted for solar on the Andrews, and that will be installed in the fall.

422
01:30:11,264 --> 01:30:23,095
[SPEAKER_00]: There was talk of doing it in the summer, but after consulting with the general contractor and the solar company, the decision was to just do the construction after the new HVAC equipment goes in.

423
01:30:23,615 --> 01:30:26,818
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's contracted for, the pricing is locked in, and that one is happening.

424
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:30,932
[SPEAKER_00]: What we don't know is, will we get that 30% back?

425
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:32,413
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.

426
01:30:32,553 --> 01:30:34,374
[SPEAKER_00]: It still exists right now.

427
01:30:34,394 --> 01:30:35,955
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

428
01:30:36,135 --> 01:30:41,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I say we move, but I know my colleague has a... I'm going to go to Dr. Galusi and then member Olapade.

429
01:30:42,298 --> 01:30:43,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a quick question.

430
01:30:43,339 --> 01:30:51,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Would how you approach the roofing contingency or the refurbishment of the roof have anything to do with this decision?

431
01:30:53,084 --> 01:30:53,185
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

432
01:30:56,150 --> 01:31:16,488
[SPEAKER_02]: The roof, interestingly enough, I came into this thinking that we would have a tremendous savings by doing a new roof and looking at solar and putting a new roof on the refurbishment of the roof gives us the same lifespan, and I believe I said that the over the.

433
01:31:17,162 --> 01:31:20,703
[SPEAKER_02]: cost of the new roof and insulation was going to be approximately $3 million.

434
01:31:21,464 --> 01:31:27,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And our payback on energy savings from the new insulation was only going to be about $300,000.

435
01:31:27,406 --> 01:31:33,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the span of the life of the roof, it would cost us about $1.2, $1.3 million more than the refurbishment at $1.5 million, given the savings on the insulation.

436
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:48,995
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a very eye opening project and.

437
01:31:49,015 --> 01:31:56,589
[SPEAKER_11]: So, opening expensive project.

438
01:32:00,207 --> 01:32:00,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

439
01:32:00,667 --> 01:32:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quick question going back to the ADA compliance point you made.

440
01:32:05,628 --> 01:32:12,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you mentioned that you're focusing primarily on the most like egregious, you know, eminent ones or emergent ones for the ones that are a little bit more negligible.

441
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:29,353
[SPEAKER_04]: So like the movement of the toilets, for example, or the doors, is there a listing of like where, you know, how to say a listing of every individual instance of it, like in, you know, C1 and B3, for example, the high school, but is there a way for us to see just kind of like a general understanding about where those, like the severity of those, is that possible at all?

442
01:32:29,713 --> 01:32:29,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

443
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:35,575
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to list those out for in order to apply for the variant.

444
01:32:35,595 --> 01:32:36,596
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have the list.

445
01:32:36,616 --> 01:32:38,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you could share that with us just so that we have that.

446
01:32:38,438 --> 01:32:43,383
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that members of the public might benefit from having understanding that we're not not in compliance necessarily.

447
01:32:43,403 --> 01:32:50,131
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are instances where the overall cost for the shifting of that, where the disparity is and so why we're making certain decisions.

448
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:54,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're not actively trying to avoid compliance, but there are those costs that we're trying to deal with.

449
01:32:54,423 --> 01:32:58,405
[SPEAKER_06]: And for a lot of them, I mean, the benefit is so minimal for the cost of it.

450
01:32:58,445 --> 01:33:04,707
[SPEAKER_06]: So for instance, one of them is, you know, raising all of the sinks by one inch.

451
01:33:05,007 --> 01:33:08,349
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lot of plumbing and tile work and things like that.

452
01:33:08,369 --> 01:33:10,509
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be very expensive for very little benefit.

453
01:33:10,589 --> 01:33:10,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

454
01:33:10,870 --> 01:33:11,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.

455
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:11,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

456
01:33:12,050 --> 01:33:15,433
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I could just address a couple of the quick.

457
01:33:15,574 --> 01:33:23,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So, over the years, schools, make install new toilet paper holders because they get a good deal on toilet paper from a company.

458
01:33:23,802 --> 01:33:35,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were installed above the rails, they should be below the rails, because if a person is going to grab and they hit that they may miss, not they may they will miss the hold, and they could fall.

459
01:33:36,592 --> 01:33:40,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one is doors swinging in instead of out.

460
01:33:42,276 --> 01:33:49,080
[SPEAKER_02]: The final one that I'll mention is accessible sinks don't have insulation on the pipes.

461
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:54,723
[SPEAKER_02]: So if someone in a wheelchair pulls in, they could burn themselves on a pipe potentially.

462
01:33:55,123 --> 01:33:58,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are things that were not part of the building code when the buildings were built.

463
01:33:58,866 --> 01:34:00,887
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you do a project of this magnitude,

464
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:07,677
[SPEAKER_02]: these are the things that need to be considered and I can definitely share those documents with committee and anyone else that would like.

465
01:34:08,358 --> 01:34:08,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

466
01:34:11,221 --> 01:34:11,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

467
01:34:14,813 --> 01:34:15,133
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

468
01:34:15,674 --> 01:34:16,354
[SPEAKER_12]: One more question.

469
01:34:16,915 --> 01:34:23,680
[SPEAKER_12]: The roof that causes it to rain sideways into the kindergarten classroom, is that being fixed?

470
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:24,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It is included.

471
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,301
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been mentioned how many times.

472
01:34:26,442 --> 01:34:28,043
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I bring it up every other meeting.

473
01:34:28,063 --> 01:34:28,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

474
01:34:28,863 --> 01:34:30,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

475
01:34:31,765 --> 01:34:34,007
[SPEAKER_12]: I really want that kindergarten class to be fixed.

476
01:34:34,327 --> 01:34:41,873
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that I've re-shared the same documents with everybody probably five times at this point because it's not falling off of my radar.

477
01:34:42,463 --> 01:35:03,572
[SPEAKER_12]: And I guess the other thing worth mentioning is with this list of changes that we're not going to pursue at this time like I do think the director of facilities and the to be assistant director of facilities needs to have that list so that the next time we get a deal on toilet paper and somebody comes to install

478
01:35:04,695 --> 01:35:15,017
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, new containers for toilet paper that we're, like, hawking them to do it right and in compliance every single time we can.

479
01:35:15,057 --> 01:35:32,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I know from time to time, the maintenance team has to rebuild a bathroom for a variety of reasons, and if they have to do it anyway, they should be doing it in a way that sort of brings us to where we, you know, where we want to be, because those things are small, but they matter to people who need them.

480
01:35:34,102 --> 01:35:48,966
[SPEAKER_12]: um I just want to make sure that it's on it it doesn't like go in the project file and go in a filing cabinet and instead it is very in a very real way still on our radar um as we move forward beyond this project.

481
01:35:50,526 --> 01:35:50,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

482
01:35:55,908 --> 01:35:56,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Intoppa.

483
01:35:59,489 --> 01:36:02,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I also just yeah I really want to echo that point of like while these things

484
01:36:03,913 --> 01:36:23,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what I want to say is when this list is sent to us, I really do welcome any community input about a lot of these issues because like, again, while they may be small to some people who may be a little more able-bodied or may not run into these issues, it's good to know like if someone has like, oh, I'm not crazy.

485
01:36:23,301 --> 01:36:28,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is actually something that significantly impacts my mobility, or this is something that, you know,

486
01:36:29,528 --> 01:36:44,295
[SPEAKER_03]: just the day to day like this is a small frustration like yeah my knees get colder like they get burned from that like this is, these are all really good things that I would hope that the community would also be able to take a look at and say I used to I frequent this building this is something that affects me on a daily basis I thought it was small but I'm not crazy.

487
01:36:44,815 --> 01:36:48,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Just that little affirmation of like no this needs to be changed.

488
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:49,537
[SPEAKER_03]: And we acknowledge that.

489
01:36:50,445 --> 01:36:59,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Um but II do want to get a little bit away from the like, well, it's a little small like it does seem small to some people but like it really is a huge thing for a lot of people's day to day.

490
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:04,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just welcome that community input whenever that list is made available.

491
01:37:04,173 --> 01:37:10,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you to my colleagues for for raising that that concern and ask and thank you for doing the work and thank you for acknowledging it.

492
01:37:11,337 --> 01:37:11,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

493
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:15,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Um is there a motion for approval for this project?

494
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:21,035
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember all party.

495
01:37:21,395 --> 01:37:23,737
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor, roll call.

496
01:37:31,902 --> 01:37:34,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember Graham.

497
01:37:34,844 --> 01:37:36,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, remember and Papa.

498
01:37:36,065 --> 01:37:37,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember all the party.

499
01:37:37,266 --> 01:37:38,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, remember I'm Phil.

500
01:37:38,807 --> 01:37:40,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, remember so yes Maryland occur.

501
01:37:41,008 --> 01:37:44,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes 76 in the affirmative one absent motions approved.

502
01:37:44,691 --> 01:37:45,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the hard work.

503
01:37:48,993 --> 01:37:57,898
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not have any presentations of the public or continued business, but we do have an item under new business 2025-11 offered by member Graham and member Reinfeld.

504
01:37:58,558 --> 01:38:03,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Whereas Medford's graduation requirements regarding health and physical education exceeds state requirements.

505
01:38:03,641 --> 01:38:08,163
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas some high school students have substantial physical activity outside of the school day.

506
01:38:08,183 --> 01:38:15,107
[SPEAKER_11]: And whereas some high school students are unable to access all aspects of educational programming offered by MPS.

507
01:38:16,597 --> 01:38:21,478
[SPEAKER_11]: example is arts and language and core subjects and vocational education and PE health.

508
01:38:22,159 --> 01:38:34,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Be resolved that the administration will provide a recommendation to policy IKF dash requirements for graduation that increases flexibilities for students by changing the health and physical education requirements.

509
01:38:34,622 --> 01:38:39,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it further resolved that the administration will bring this recommendation to the committee no later than June 1st, 2025.

510
01:38:41,544 --> 01:38:47,851
[SPEAKER_11]: be it also resolved the administration will be prepared to implement approved changes for the fiscal for the school years 2025-2026.

511
01:38:47,871 --> 01:38:54,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinfeld, Member Graham, or is there a motion for approval?

512
01:38:55,877 --> 01:38:56,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

513
01:38:56,618 --> 01:38:57,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

514
01:38:57,779 --> 01:38:59,361
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I put this on.

515
01:39:00,301 --> 01:39:10,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I honestly don't remember ever touching policy IKF in six years and this is this is going to be our third go around this year, which is sort of interesting.

516
01:39:11,031 --> 01:39:18,017
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think on the one hand like you don't really want to change your graduation requirements like constantly because that becomes really hard for students.

517
01:39:19,698 --> 01:39:29,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Um in all of the conversation that we've had about the schedule and the need for changes to the schedule to increase flexibility and increase access.

518
01:39:30,447 --> 01:39:40,536
[SPEAKER_12]: Um I think we have an opportunity to look at um the the health and PE requirements as well to say what could we do differently here?

519
01:39:40,636 --> 01:39:42,157
[SPEAKER_12]: What do other communities do?

520
01:39:42,177 --> 01:39:44,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Um to create some flexibility in our

521
01:39:47,341 --> 01:39:53,423
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's a perfect answer to every single schedule ailment that exists in the world.

522
01:39:54,023 --> 01:39:57,124
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think there's maybe some opportunity for flexibility.

523
01:39:57,184 --> 01:40:02,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Like if we can teach Spanish online, we can teach health online.

524
01:40:02,925 --> 01:40:05,006
[SPEAKER_12]: I have every confidence in the world that that's true.

525
01:40:06,306 --> 01:40:11,568
[SPEAKER_12]: If we have students who are multi-sport athletes, maybe they would prefer to

526
01:40:12,308 --> 01:40:29,235
[SPEAKER_12]: wave out of it I don't know there's just there's a whole bunch of options that happen in other parts of the community and my feeling in bringing this forward was to hear from the administration what could work and provide flexibility and solutions to students who

527
01:40:30,375 --> 01:40:34,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Even as we go forward with new scheduling options, it's still not perfect.

528
01:40:34,796 --> 01:40:42,897
[SPEAKER_12]: My daughter is still talking about taking classes at Bunker Hill because there still isn't enough room in her schedule to do what she wants to do.

529
01:40:43,878 --> 01:40:55,600
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it fixes everything, but I would like if we're going to make this big change to the schedule that we also look at the impact of some flexibility here so that we're not touching this policy

530
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:02,022
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, multiple times a year, every single year, and we can just sort of get it all done at this point.

531
01:41:02,122 --> 01:41:04,682
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was my purpose for bringing it forward.

532
01:41:04,782 --> 01:41:09,104
[SPEAKER_12]: I think, you know, I've heard lots of different scheduled challenges over the years.

533
01:41:09,564 --> 01:41:21,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know that this sort of solves every single problem, but I think having options is important because one size does not fit all in terms of all the programming that's going on at the

534
01:41:21,907 --> 01:41:22,388
[SPEAKER_12]: at the high school.

535
01:41:22,408 --> 01:41:25,210
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't have a particular solution in mind.

536
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:36,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Reinfeld didn't have a particular solution in mind, but more to say, can the people who sort of live the complications of this every day bring forward some suggestions about how our graduation requirements might change?

537
01:41:37,481 --> 01:41:37,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

538
01:41:38,622 --> 01:41:39,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Member Graham.

539
01:41:39,282 --> 01:41:39,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld?

540
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:46,184
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just add to that, that the state provides limited flexibility in some areas.

541
01:41:46,244 --> 01:42:06,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think it's really important where there is some flexibility to increase, as member Graham said, options for students and provide students with the autonomy to do the things that they are passionate about and really make electives things that they elect to do while still meeting basic health and academic requirements.

542
01:42:08,582 --> 01:42:15,224
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know our various departments have done a lot of work to build really wonderful electives in a lot of different areas.

543
01:42:15,364 --> 01:42:18,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want as many students to be able to access those as possible.

544
01:42:19,785 --> 01:42:21,006
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, so that's a motion for approval.

545
01:42:21,286 --> 01:42:21,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinfeld?

546
01:42:22,286 --> 01:42:22,506
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

547
01:42:22,726 --> 01:42:24,167
[SPEAKER_11]: And seconded by Member Graham?

548
01:42:24,187 --> 01:42:25,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

549
01:42:25,907 --> 01:42:26,587
