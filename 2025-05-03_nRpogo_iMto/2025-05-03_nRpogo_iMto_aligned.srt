00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:33,987
Hello everyone and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Method.

2
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:36,189
I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:44,875
The purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:51,120
Today we have not one, but three very, very special guests.

5
00:00:52,629 --> 00:01:01,151
Nell Escobar Coakley, Chris Stevens, and Wendell Waters, founders of Gotta Know Medford.

6
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:07,572
They will be speaking about their new venture and what it's gonna bring to Medford.

7
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:16,655
So let me begin, I'm gonna begin, I'll ask each of you, tell us a little bit about yourself and your background.

8
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:17,915
And we'll start with Nell.

9
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:19,365
Thank you.

10
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:24,247
Well, I have been in the field of journalism for more than 30 years.

11
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:35,071
I was the editor of the Medford Transcript for 17 years and was with the paper for 20 years, so pretty well versed in the city of Medford.

12
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:39,973
I know a lot of the folks here and I'm really glad to be back in a news capacity.

13
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:45,435
I've worked in all sorts of different fields.

14
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:46,535
I've been a freelancer.

15
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:48,516
I've done stories about everything under the sun.

16
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:49,717
I was a managing editor.

17
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:58,301
And at my very last sort of position working for a big newspaper company, I was the deputy director of Massachusetts State News.

18
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,321
Wow.

19
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,682
So you've done it all.

20
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,923
You got some experience, some great experience.

21
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:03,443
Just a little bit.

22
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,124
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:05,544
Just a little bit of experience, yeah.

24
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:06,725
OK, yeah, yeah.

25
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,873
Chris, how about yourself?

26
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:11,854
So a few years less than Nell.

27
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:17,797
I've been in the newspaper field for about 25 years, a little over 25 years.

28
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:28,723
So I was at the Lynn item for 15 years where I was a reporter, I was a beat reporter, and I also had a food column for 14 years, which was a lot of fun.

29
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:35,987
Like Nell, I've covered everything from courts to local government to arts and

30
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:42,927
everything, neighborhood disputes, you name it, I've covered it, which is fun.

31
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:46,308
It's the fun part about the job, because you never really know what's going to happen in a day.

32
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:52,850
I was at the Marblehead Reporter for seven years as their editor, and since then, I've been freelancing.

33
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,371
So I've done- Pretty good stuff.

34
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:57,092
Yeah, like Mel, I've done a lot.

35
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,633
I wasn't deputy director of anything, but I've done a lot of stuff.

36
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,093
Yeah, but still pretty good stuff.

37
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:01,654
You're way up there.

38
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,214
I'm up there.

39
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:04,395
Oh yeah, definitely, definitely.

40
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:06,536
Wendell, how about you?

41
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:09,657
Yeah, I was never deputy director of anything.

42
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:11,978
Not even in my house.

43
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,441
But I've been involved in publishing in one form or another for about 40 years.

44
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:23,424
I started my career at a magazine called Modern Materials Handling back in the day.

45
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:29,748
And most recently, I've been with, I was with Wicked Local and worked for a number of different papers.

46
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,909
And during that time, I mostly was a writer, but I also did

47
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,873
you know, videos and photos and I wrote columns and did a podcast, a little of this and a little of that, so.

48
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:49,277
Well versed, you're well, you've done it all too, so a lot of experience on this table.

49
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,638
Yeah, we've covered all the bases.

50
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:53,780
That's probably not a story topic that we haven't covered.

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,981
I'm looking forward to see what you're going to do for Method.

52
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,201
I really am, I mean that.

53
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:58,242
I'm looking forward to it.

54
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:07,087
All right, so before we get into Got to Know Method, we're going to learn a lot about what's going on.

55
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,868
You are all part of local newspapers.

56
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:11,308
Yes.

57
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:17,110
And one of the things I always wonder, I think about is, what happened

58
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,513
to local newspapers.

59
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:23,395
We always went to them.

60
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:24,916
I mean, forever.

61
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:29,720
It's heartbreaking.

62
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,021
We can go in the same order.

63
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:32,022
What do you think?

64
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:32,903
I mean, what happened?

65
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:33,964
Why did it happen?

66
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:34,644
Who did it?

67
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,066
We can tell you why it happened.

68
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,187
Please, please do.

69
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:43,372
Well, you have a lot of huge media companies, and they own everything.

70
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,132
And they're very

71
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,278
very busy not doing the news.

72
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:49,321
They're very busy responding to their shareholders.

73
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:54,989
So it's more important that the shareholders get their money than residents get their news.

74
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,696
So we've seen a lot of cutbacks in the industry over the last

75
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:05,420
at least 10, 20 years, and it seemed like every time you turn around, there were more cutbacks and more cutbacks.

76
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:18,287
And about three or four years ago, our bosses, where we worked, told us that they had come up with focus groups and studies that people were very interested in 15 topics.

77
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:24,029
If you're asking me to remember what they are right now, I'm not going to be able to tell you.

78
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,650
But... I can only imagine.

79
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,990
It was your basic.

80
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,890
It was arts.

81
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:29,931
It was food.

82
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:30,851
It was travel.

83
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:32,431
Development.

84
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:32,952
State house.

85
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:33,512
Government.

86
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:36,753
But the thing was, they wanted to go to a regionalized model.

87
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:40,734
So what they wanted, they wanted topic reporters instead of local reporters.

88
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:50,856
So they started this program where they split everyone up, and then they started closing smaller titles, and they started to incorporate other titles.

89
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,716
And it didn't work.

90
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,037
It just didn't work.

91
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:56,797
And we told them that it wouldn't work.

92
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:57,377
We did.

93
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,918
When they came up with the idea, we were very vocal.

94
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:01,398
We were vocal.

95
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,139
Our readers were vocal.

96
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,519
Our communities were vocal.

97
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:13,361
We didn't think it would work, and then three months later, they were like, this isn't working, and they laid off about 400 people nationwide.

98
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:14,182
Us among them.

99
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:18,483
I personally just think it's terrible, that's all, because... It was heartbreaking.

100
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:19,303
Very heartbreaking.

101
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:22,604
I mean, our newspapers were huge, as you know.

102
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,365
People love their community newspapers.

103
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:26,705
That's right.

104
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,606
And that disappeared.

105
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:32,127
And it was heartbreaking for us because that's what we've done for 25 years.

106
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,388
We put our heart and soul into those papers.

107
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:37,750
And I am a complete believer of community news.

108
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,131
I think it's wildly important.

109
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,112
And they just didn't, which was

110
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:44,193
No, it's sad.

111
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,074
It was more the statistics.

112
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:47,475
This is what the studies say.

113
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:48,596
This is what the stats say.

114
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,118
No, what the people are saying is what the studies were saying.

115
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:53,359
I'm not going to get into the name.

116
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,240
I don't even know the name of the local paper.

117
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,863
But every once in a while, I'll go out with a few guys, a cup of coffee, and there's the papers.

118
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:03,665
And, you know, I'll buy a paper occasionally still, because I like reading newspapers.

119
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:07,690
We have one, but it's not Medford.

120
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,611
I don't know what it is.

121
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:13,595
They're still doing the regional model, but they're not doing the regional model with reporters.

122
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:19,160
So you get two or three people writing a story, and then those people get handed off to someone.

123
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,061
Somebody edits it.

124
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:24,905
Those people look at it and say, we're putting this in every single one of these papers.

125
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,248
And so it doesn't matter whether it has a Medford angle.

126
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:29,469
It's another form of ghosting.

127
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,090
Well, I don't see anyone pick the paper up.

128
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,470
It's there.

129
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:36,773
They're newspapers without reporters attached.

130
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,893
So they're ghost papers is what they call them.

131
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:39,534
Zombie papers.

132
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:39,894
Yeah.

133
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:40,834
There you go.

134
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:42,014
All right.

135
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:47,516
So, you know, why do you think it's important?

136
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:50,177
I mean, I think you covered some of it with the last answer.

137
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:51,637
But why is it so important?

138
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:56,338
I mean, what was the purpose of starting a digital newspaper?

139
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:57,719
What do you think?

140
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,999
I mean, anyone can take it.

141
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:00,279
Yeah.

142
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:01,300
I guess I'll start.

143
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,663
We feel it's really important that people know what's going on in their community.

144
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:08,825
That's first and foremost.

145
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:21,855
And also, we feel that having a newspaper in a community, you're holding the government accountable, which is a piece that's really fallen by the wayside with all the closing of the local newspapers.

146
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,537
So it's both of those things.

147
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:25,358
Right.

148
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:26,799
Across the country, right?

149
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,442
So for us, it's about building community.

150
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:42,703
in Medford and getting to know people and letting them know what's happening, what are events, what meetings, anything big happening at City Hall, all that good stuff.

151
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,604
It's important.

152
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:49,388
When we formed our company, which is Gotta Know Media, we were looking at different communities.

153
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:56,152
And the interesting thing was I live in an adjoining community and I kept coming here and I kept seeing people I know.

154
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:59,933
And they kept saying to me, oh my gosh, you need to come to Medford.

155
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,174
You should come back to Medford.

156
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,094
Come back to Medford.

157
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:11,718
So when we were doing some research as to where to go, this seemed like the obvious place, because so many people had said, we are just absolutely in need of something here.

158
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:12,858
I mean, Nell had deep roots here.

159
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,439
Right.

160
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,400
And it's a ripe community, because you're a growing community.

161
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,201
You're an ever-changing community.

162
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:24,082
So it was just sort of natural sense to come here.

163
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:29,228
And the next question I was going to ask is, what's the value?

164
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,592
What value are you bringing to method?

165
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,934
I think you hit on that though.

166
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:34,416
I mean, basically.

167
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,850
Yeah, I mean, the value is being here.

168
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,271
It's bringing information.

169
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,673
It's building a community, which is what we hope to do around the paper.

170
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:45,796
It's giving people a voice.

171
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:49,038
It's giving people a place to go to and a voice of their own.

172
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:50,719
Because we want to hear from people, too.

173
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:58,765
I mean, as much as we want to put information out there and tell you where to go and how to do things and what's going on in your community, we want to hear from you as well.

174
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,428
And we're starting social media, so that'll be another access point.

175
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:03,048
That's good.

176
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:06,511
So what contributions are you looking to make?

177
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:13,938
If I, you know, basic answer is, you know, you're going to make a contribution.

178
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,260
What do you feel your contribution is going to be?

179
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,243
We want to rebuild the community.

180
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:23,145
I mean, everyone feels very divisive.

181
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:28,028
And there's not a lot of respect for what someone's opinions might be.

182
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,189
But we want to rebuild that.

183
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:34,331
When I worked in Medford a million years ago, people were respectful.

184
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:35,852
They didn't agree.

185
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,293
Never have they agreed.

186
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,554
But they were respectful of each other.

187
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:44,616
And people would come to the paper for, oh, my kid did this.

188
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:47,418
Or did you know that this person is doing that?

189
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:50,919
And there was a real sense of community in the paper.

190
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:56,202
And we always gave people their voice to send in columns or send in letters to the editor.

191
00:10:57,002 --> 00:10:58,843
And that's what we are looking to rebuild.

192
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:07,447
We're looking to be the forum for people to come and send us their information, let us know that their grandpa had an 80th birthday.

193
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:13,490
You know, we want to be that, I guess, that bridge, that bridge to the community.

194
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:34,993
and you're looking to cover everything sports i mean yeah yeah we just recently hired a sports reporter actually so we have um have started covering sports i do a lot of as much of the art scene as i can so reach out to me please because i love to cover local artists and local um theater groups and whatnot but and definitely city hall is you know is a big part of that

195
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,495
But yeah, anything and everything.

196
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:40,776
We're starting to hire a couple of freelancers as well.

197
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:41,316
Oh, nice.

198
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:41,996
I didn't know that.

199
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:42,816
I wasn't aware.

200
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:44,197
We literally just started that.

201
00:11:44,257 --> 00:11:48,718
We have somebody covering the Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year Banquet on Tuesday.

202
00:11:48,978 --> 00:11:49,698
Nice.

203
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:56,840
And our recent hire for a sports guy is Chris Hurley, who is here for a million years with the transcript.

204
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:01,102
He is very well versed in sports in the city of Medford.

205
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:03,443
Again, which is nice.

206
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:06,664
It gives us some starting roots here.

207
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,306
So if I ask you what your target audience is?

208
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:13,888
Everybody!

209
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:15,488
We want everybody!

210
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:16,529
And that's it.

211
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,030
We're a true community newspaper in that sense.

212
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,192
That's why I said we want to cover everything.

213
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,153
How much of that we get to and how much we do well depends on...

214
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:29,095
We're three people.

215
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,317
Yeah, we're three people right now, so keep that in mind.

216
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:35,381
Three people with full-time jobs and doing this because we love it.

217
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,502
We love what we do.

218
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:40,046
And we're hoping that this will become our full-time job before long.

219
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:44,570
I hope so, too, because I think you're going to be very successful.

220
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,271
I really do.

221
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:46,672
I think you're doing a great job.

222
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,934
I subscribe and I get your

223
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:50,916
And I think it's great.

224
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:51,677
I really do.

225
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:56,160
You know, the information you're putting out already, and you've just gotten started.

226
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:57,642
We're trying to be diverse.

227
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:05,768
We're trying to do a little bit of sports, a little bit of arts, a little bit of City Hall, you know, information we think people need.

228
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:10,730
working on getting into the schools, love to cover stuff in the schools, so hopefully we'll be doing that.

229
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,851
Important stuff, yeah.

230
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:19,433
Yeah, just not even just school committee meetings, I mean those are always important, what's going on policy-wise, budget-wise, but also in the classroom.

231
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:21,674
I love to see what kids are doing in the classroom.

232
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,735
You know, let's see how those tax dollars are being spent.

233
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,655
Let's show the cool and the fun stuff.

234
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,536
I mean, you have the vocational school right here.

235
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:30,577
They do amazing, they are doing some amazing things.

236
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:32,598
We did a show on them, yeah.

237
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,418
It's tremendous.

238
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:36,119
Dave invited me in, so I can't wait to get over there and do something.

239
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,960
Yeah, it's nice.

240
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,861
You're going to have a, yeah.

241
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,182
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

242
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:46,686
It's great to be, for me, it's great to just be reconnecting with people that I've known for a really long time.

243
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:52,130
And it's just so much fun to have them connect and say, hey, we'd like to meet for coffee.

244
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,992
And we've got, you know, we've got some ideas.

245
00:13:54,092 --> 00:14:00,837
And so we definitely, we've actually gotten a lot of email from people who have said, how can we help?

246
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,218
How can we support you?

247
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:02,678
So nice.

248
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:05,200
which is very, very nice.

249
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,260
How can we be part?

250
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,102
I'm not a writer, but what can I do?

251
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:11,604
What can I do to help you keep growing?

252
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:16,667
I think you girls are gonna be very successful.

253
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:23,031
Me personally, this city has been looking for you for a long time.

254
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:24,972
It's nice to meet you in person.

255
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,254
I want the whole city to meet you in person.

256
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:30,236
Because it is, it's important.

257
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:34,559
I think, you know, and what you're set out to do is, you know, it's great.

258
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:41,665
And now, you know, I got a tough question, because I always, I always think about it.

259
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:43,907
We ask a lot of tough questions.

260
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:52,714
Like, okay, so, you know, you're doing what you're doing, and you're starting out, and it's, you know, slowly building up.

261
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:56,196
What, who makes, who's making the decisions?

262
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,641
What do you decide?

263
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:02,065
How do you decide what gets in the paper, what doesn't go in the paper?

264
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:04,628
Does anyone, I mean... We talk a lot.

265
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:05,229
You do.

266
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,410
We text willy-nilly.

267
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:26,168
I'm always curious like when we started in the beginning We made a pact the three of us made a pact that we would always be honest with each other Even if we didn't want to hear it and that majority rules if we ever come to You know a decision that we can't reach right away.

268
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:31,792
Yeah, um, and that's really I mean we've sort of been working for about two years, so That's really

269
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,453
Yeah, it's taken us a while to get this up and running.

270
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:36,595
It's not like we just started.

271
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:43,620
I know it's a lot of work, and most people don't realize the amount of work that you have to do even before you get on.

272
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,721
We talk every day.

273
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:47,062
So it's, hey, I'm going to do this story about that.

274
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:50,825
We have a running list of stories in our budget, so we check that a lot.

275
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:54,788
And like I said, we're texting and calling each other all the time.

276
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:56,989
And there are questions.

277
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:59,131
I mean, we recently had a

278
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:10,822
submission that we are discussing on whether we want to put it in or not, whether this is a good time to run it, or maybe we want to sit on it for a little bit.

279
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:16,124
So, yeah, there are things that, you know, and a lot of that comes with the experience and experience that we've had.

280
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:17,504
We've made those mistakes.

281
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,145
Yeah, that's right.

282
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,365
Exactly.

283
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:23,807
And if we do get in a place where we can't really settle it,

284
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:26,508
We drop the gloves and we settle in on the ice.

285
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:27,408
There you go, I love it.

286
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,209
I love doing business like that.

287
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:31,349
That's beautiful.

288
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,129
I love that.

289
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,930
I really do.

290
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,990
We have yet to drag Nell out on the ice yet.

291
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:37,971
I have another great question.

292
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,152
Okay, what happens?

293
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:43,333
Have you ever come to this, you know, all three years agree?

294
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,413
Does that ever happen?

295
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:44,993
Oh yeah.

296
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,214
Oh yeah, frequently, yeah.

297
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:46,674
Oh, okay.

298
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:51,799
The reason we make such a good team is that we have a lot of the same sort of sensibilities.

299
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,501
Yeah, we're pretty much on the same page.

300
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:54,022
Yeah.

301
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:55,003
And we've worked together for a long time.

302
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,325
We've worked together for a long time.

303
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:56,565
Yeah.

304
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:58,868
I mean, we've worked together for about a decade, almost a decade.

305
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:02,212
Sometimes it's always like, seems like, you know, one person always

306
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:03,508
Yeah.

307
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:04,948
But this is good.

308
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:05,969
So yeah, no, this is good.

309
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,189
Three is always working together.

310
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:08,389
Yeah.

311
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,970
Yeah, we used to we used to at one point be a foursome.

312
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,571
But yeah, our other person decided she she just couldn't do it.

313
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:16,311
She couldn't.

314
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:17,452
It was a big leap.

315
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,272
It's a lot of work.

316
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,793
I really do understand.

317
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:21,993
Yeah.

318
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:22,513
Well,

319
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:29,198
people don't, but I appreciate it and I think the whole city, I really do.

320
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:30,379
I think you're going to be welcomed.

321
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:37,524
I think once the word gets out there about what you're doing, how you're doing it, why you're doing it, I really do.

322
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:41,227
I just, oh, I want it to take off because we need a newspaper.

323
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:42,828
People have been very welcoming.

324
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:43,489
They have been wonderful.

325
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,132
We've received a lot, like I said, a lot of feedback from people just saying hi.

326
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:51,433
I just wanted to say hello.

327
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,295
Like I said, they've been welcoming, very much so.

328
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:57,937
Of course, we haven't been around long enough to irritate anyone yet either, so there's that.

329
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:59,358
We're ready for that.

330
00:17:59,418 --> 00:17:59,918
No, I know.

331
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:01,899
Well, that's going to happen too, but you've got to expect that.

332
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:02,799
But we're used to that.

333
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:03,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,961
So, I mean, measuring success.

335
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,522
I mean, how do you measure it?

336
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:12,365
Where are you now and where do you want to go?

337
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:17,088
I mean, there's the basics of analytics, of just looking at your analytics.

338
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,450
You can see who's reading what, how long they're staying in a story.

339
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,892
It's amazing if you pay attention to your analytics, what it can tell you.

340
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:24,354
So there's that.

341
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:25,474
Feedback.

342
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:26,055
Feedback.

343
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:29,157
And like you said, so far the feedback has all been good.

344
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,178
It's all been well.

345
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:33,441
There's been a lot of word of mouth.

346
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,864
We're so happy to be on your show.

347
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:44,091
We've done a couple of interviews with some local papers, but we haven't really done publicity.

348
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:48,475
meet the editor.

349
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,816
Coffee and donuts kind of thing, but we just haven't done it yet.

350
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,337
We've been too busy.

351
00:18:53,457 --> 00:19:11,623
One of the things that we definitely want to do, and I think we're going to be doing this in the fall, because right now since we're coming on summer, not a lot of people around, we're hoping to do a News Deserts workshop at the library with Dan Kennedy and Ellen, what is Ellen's last name?

352
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:21,161
Ellen Clegg, yes, they wrote a book about news deserts and the library is, we've been working with them a little bit about doing something and introduce ourselves to more people.

353
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,041
That is a beautiful library.

354
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:23,882
Oh, it really is, yeah.

355
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,243
It's been word of mouth.

356
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:29,884
Another thing people don't know about, it is all word of mouth, but I've been up there quite a bit.

357
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:32,145
I mean, I've done things with other people.

358
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:33,265
Go and check out your library.

359
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:33,946
It's amazing.

360
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:34,386
It is.

361
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:35,786
People have to check it out.

362
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,327
We did a show on the library.

363
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:38,508
Yeah, we really did.

364
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,088
And I was like, wow.

365
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:41,429
And the staff is so great.

366
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:42,510
And they offer so much.

367
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,270
It's amazing.

368
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,631
And people don't realize what they offer.

369
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,652
And it's something for everyone.

370
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,513
There really is today.

371
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,615
And they've been very supportive of us, too.

372
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,756
And you say it like I do, library.

373
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:55,437
Yes, library.

374
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,378
Some people think it's library.

375
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:58,238
Don't tell me.

376
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,839
No, it's not library.

377
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,679
It never was.

378
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,080
It's library.

379
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,982
You know, that's library.

380
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:06,923
No, no, no, no, no.

381
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,104
All right, so, you know, the feedback's been good.

382
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,104
I'm glad to hear that.

383
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,406
What about the difficulties?

384
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:23,368
I mean, it's got to be, I mean, you got to have days where it's, you know, what obstacles are you facing?

385
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,369
You know, what are your biggest obstacles, difficulties?

386
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:33,843
Aside from sitting in front of the computer for three hours and realizing you don't have a paragraph?

387
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:36,867
Because writing is so easy.

388
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,010
It's difficult.

389
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,955
People aren't used to having a newspaper in their computer anymore.

390
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:55,741
We were just reading, I was just reading an article in Pointner which had this fabulous thing saying, you know, more and more of these independent little newspapers are finding that they're hitting their head against a wall.

391
00:20:55,801 --> 00:21:03,383
And it's because so many of those communities, when they lost their papers, they switched, you know, town officials.

392
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:05,384
So town officials aren't used to being accountable.

393
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,865
They're not used to talking to newspapers.

394
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:07,825
And they don't think they have to.

395
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:08,685
And they don't think they have to.

396
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:09,326
Exactly.

397
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:10,266
I agree.

398
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,267
So we can just take this as a fair warning.

399
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:14,409
They don't.

400
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:20,518
I mean, it would be very nice if they would return phone calls and answer our questions.

401
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,201
And we're not out to get anybody.

402
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,643
We're just out to tell a story.

403
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:28,490
But the idea that we won't do the story because they won't call us, yeah, that's a myth.

404
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,492
Because we're going to do the story anyway.

405
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:38,018
It would be nicer to do it with, you know, with all the voices that we can get, because that's really, again, that's what we want to do.

406
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:40,600
We want to be the voice for the community.

407
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,042
We want the community to have its voice.

408
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:43,683
We'll write the stories anyway.

409
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:46,605
There's no urgency to return calls.

410
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:47,566
Yeah.

411
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,828
I mean, what's your experience?

412
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:53,612
City Hall, you know, the local government, I mean, are they

413
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:55,667
To be diplomatic.

414
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:56,627
What's the feeling?

415
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:57,968
Are they helping you out?

416
00:21:58,028 --> 00:21:59,109
Are they welcoming you?

417
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:00,229
They're welcoming.

418
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:01,570
They're very welcoming.

419
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,190
I would think so.

420
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,613
But they're also very structured in the way that you have to request news.

421
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:11,495
So you can't just call up someone that you want to talk to.

422
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:15,498
You have to go through a certain process.

423
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,079
And that is very frustrating.

424
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,959
Because sometimes you're just asking a very innocuous question.

425
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,360
And you could just literally call up that person.

426
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,521
What day is the garbage picked up?

427
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:28,122
And it's like, I just need to talk to a guy from DPW.

428
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:31,163
And you're running through this maze of just trying to get that.

429
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:33,663
And that's the interesting part.

430
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:41,506
Because if we're asking these very simple questions, and they can't answer them without going through a bunch of hoops, how are they going to answer a hard question?

431
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:49,673
So, I mean... I mean, I have been told by somebody that I can't answer that because... Yeah, sometimes I think it's because they're afraid to answer.

432
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,214
I think they're afraid to say something wrong.

433
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:51,815
Even the basic stuff.

434
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,956
And they've literally been told.

435
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:54,277
I think they've literally been told.

436
00:22:54,317 --> 00:23:00,943
Like, I know that I asked a very simple question of someone recently and he told me, I can't tell you that because I can't, I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

437
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:05,385
That's not a good thing.

438
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:06,826
That's not transparency.

439
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:11,388
For a community that keeps saying it wants transparency, that's not transparency.

440
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,089
Let's be honest.

441
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,731
I can get into a whole bunch of things but I won't.

442
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:20,073
But we're hoping that we'll win them over.

443
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:22,735
It seems like you're pulling teeth to get information.

444
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,736
And it shouldn't be that way.

445
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:25,576
It should be easy.

446
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:28,318
But we're not afraid to go after that information either.

447
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:35,122
And that's the thing that I think people, like Chris was saying, I think some people say, well, if I don't give them the information, they're not, that's not true.

448
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:42,785
I don't think you're going anywhere.

449
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:47,967
Like you said, there's probably not a situation we haven't come across in our years.

450
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:51,208
Like I said, it's like what we do.

451
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:53,229
All we're doing is giving you information.

452
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:54,389
We're giving out facts.

453
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,350
We're not out to get you.

454
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:56,830
Right.

455
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,150
No one's out to get anybody.

456
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:06,838
what happened, why it happened, how it happened, who did it, who it's impacting, how it's going to hurt you, or help you.

457
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:15,647
And to be fair, this is something that's happening in communities all across Massachusetts, that governments are becoming less

458
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:16,467
Yeah.

459
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:17,968
You know, less transparent.

460
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:19,249
Yeah, this is totally not.

461
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:20,069
Very much so.

462
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:20,850
I agree with that.

463
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,510
It's everybody.

464
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,090
It's everybody.

465
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,651
Lonely, it's a horror show.

466
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:31,895
We have a lot of our colleagues that were also let go from the same conglomerate have started up neighboring papers and they're running into the same thing in their communities.

467
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:32,736
Yeah.

468
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:39,701
There's a very big independent newspaper community out there right now, and it's growing by leaps and bounds.

469
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:40,502
Yeah, it needs to.

470
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:41,663
It really does.

471
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:44,625
It's wonderful to see.

472
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:48,828
I, myself, for example, I'm a part-time editor for the Winchester News.

473
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:50,189
Oh, I didn't know that.

474
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:51,691
I learned something new today.

475
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,292
That's my other job, right.

476
00:24:53,772 --> 00:25:13,100
So what I've seen, and we've been to some different workshops and some different conferences of all these little places, and sometimes it's just people in the community with no journalism experience, and they'll start it up, and then they'll look for somebody like us, journalists, to come and help them be able to pull it all together.

477
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,422
And everybody's at different stages.

478
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:19,787
So you have people like Brookline, which they've been doing it for a really long time.

479
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:26,114
And you have people with, you know, million dollar resources, who are doing an amazing job.

480
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:30,580
But what I found is everyone has been very supportive and very helpful.

481
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,024
So, you know, people have helped us along the line.

482
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:38,866
And then we, in turn, have had people call us and say, well, how do you do this?

483
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:41,507
I'm looking to start something in my community.

484
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:42,368
How do you do it?

485
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:52,032
And we'll either give them the information that was sort of helped us, or we basically turn them over to somebody who's a little further ahead of us and who might have that information.

486
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:57,175
It has become very, very much so of a supportive little community.

487
00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:57,475
It's great.

488
00:25:57,495 --> 00:26:02,677
Yeah, and it's good for us, especially because a number of the people that we used to work with, who we miss,

489
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:10,302
I have now started publication, so we can reconnect.

490
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,745
The last question I really have, and I thank you.

491
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,007
It's been wonderful talking to you.

492
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:19,689
You know you're coming back, right?

493
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:20,249
I hope so.

494
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,170
We'd love to.

495
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:27,136
I just think it's a great thing what you're doing.

496
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:31,241
I think the city of Medford needs this.

497
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:33,363
We've wanted it for a long time.

498
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:45,732
So, I mean, what are you looking to impact as far as the way this, you know, things in the city, what do you think your impact will be?

499
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:49,715
We wanna bring the community back together and give them a forum.

500
00:26:49,755 --> 00:27:01,582
And when I first started at the transcript as its editor, my whole goal was to give the city and everyone in the paper, it's not our paper, it's your voice, right?

501
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,403
We wanna give people their voice.

502
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:06,505
You know, as Wendell keeps saying, it's your community.

503
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:08,807
We're just reporting the news.

504
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,350
This stuff is happening in your community, right?

505
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,111
We don't live here.

506
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:15,933
It's your tax dollars.

507
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:17,434
You know, and we're reporting it.

508
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:22,899
We're giving you the information so that, you know, you keep saying, you know, to make the decisions you need to make.

509
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,621
So that's the impact that we hope to have.

510
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,062
And you all know how much is going on.

511
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:30,204
We've had the charter, all the zoning.

512
00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:32,125
There's a lot going on.

513
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:38,449
We're trying to wrap our heads around all of it, watching old past meetings and stuff to try to get a handle on what's going on.

514
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:47,395
I think everyone wants similar things, but they're so far apart in this city.

515
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:51,478
You want to see improvements, but you want to see them in a certain way.

516
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:54,620
There's got to be some balance.

517
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,461
There's no balance.

518
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:56,802
Yeah, there has to be.

519
00:27:57,202 --> 00:28:07,731
I think the other impact, I mean, I'd like to see is, you know, I want people to think of us, you know, something happens, like Nell said, you've got something good in your life happens, something bad in your life happens, you want to know what's going on next door.

520
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:08,232
Right.

521
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:09,192

522
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:10,073

I'm like, yeah, it's been good.

543
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:14,632
Yeah.

544
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:16,934
Yes, they've been very, very appreciative.

545
00:29:17,114 --> 00:29:20,818

Yes I thank you the city's gonna.

Thank you.

550
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:36,010
I I'm so glad you don't know how happy I am that you came on the show I want you know people got to know what you're doing.

551
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,933
You know why you're doing the whole the whole thing and I

552
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,534
I am thrilled that you came on.

553
00:29:41,554 --> 00:29:45,416
I think we got the message out there somewhat.

554
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:47,157
We're going to continue to get the message.

555
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:47,837
We'll be back.

556
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:50,438
Like I said, you will be back.

557
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,540
You could be back on a regular basis.

558
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,560
I have a fine feeling.

559
00:29:57,622 --> 00:30:04,205
go good for everyone, not just you, but for MedFed, you know, everybody.

560
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:06,947
The response has been phenomenal.

561
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:15,711
I think when Chris and I pressed the button to go live, we were shocked because we had 300 subscribers in two days.

562
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:18,012
We did it on a Friday.

563
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:22,995
We were just like, I was in my car driving somewhere and she called me and she's like,

564
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:25,936
I was in Florida visiting my parents.

565
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:27,617
She was like, we're ready to go.

566
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:28,677
Should I press the button?

567
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:30,478
I'm like, sure, go ahead, press the button.

568
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:33,099
It was very, yeah, it wasn't very exciting.

569
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,380
We didn't pop a champagne or anything.

570
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,920
No, but it's a good story.

571
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,881
It's a great start.

572
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,582
And then by Sunday, we had over 300 people.

573
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:41,562
So it's been great.

574
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:42,582
Yeah, it's been fabulous.

575
00:30:42,602 --> 00:30:43,083
Like I said,

576
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:49,328
Unfortunately, I know, I know, we got to end the show.

577
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:55,654
You know, I just want to thank you, Nell, Chris, Wendell.

578
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,436
I mean, really, it's been a great show.

579
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:03,301
I think we did a lot of good things informing people.

580
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,760
They know your faces now, that's what you do better.

581
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,941
Is that a good thing?

582
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,023
Might even get more recognized.

583
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:15,524
