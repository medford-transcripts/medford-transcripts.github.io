00:00:28,343 --> 00:00:33,987
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello everyone and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Method.

2
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:36,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I am John Petrella.

3
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:44,875
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:51,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have not one, but three very, very special guests.

5
00:00:52,629 --> 00:01:01,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Nell Escobar Coakley, Chris Stevens, and Wendell Waters, founders of Gotta Know Medford.

6
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:07,572
[SPEAKER_00]: They will be speaking about their new venture and what it's gonna bring to Medford.

7
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:16,655
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me begin, I'm gonna begin, I'll ask each of you, tell us a little bit about yourself and your background.

8
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:17,915
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll start with Nell.

9
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:19,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

10
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:24,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have been in the field of journalism for more than 30 years.

11
00:01:25,447 --> 00:01:35,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the editor of the Medford Transcript for 17 years and was with the paper for 20 years, so pretty well versed in the city of Medford.

12
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:39,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of the folks here and I'm really glad to be back in a news capacity.

13
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:45,435
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked in all sorts of different fields.

14
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:46,535
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a freelancer.

15
00:01:46,575 --> 00:01:48,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done stories about everything under the sun.

16
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:49,717
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a managing editor.

17
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:58,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And at my very last sort of position working for a big newspaper company, I was the deputy director of Massachusetts State News.

18
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

19
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've done it all.

20
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,923
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some experience, some great experience.

21
00:02:02,943 --> 00:02:03,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit.

22
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:04,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.

23
00:02:04,284 --> 00:02:05,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit of experience, yeah.

24
00:02:05,784 --> 00:02:06,725
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, yeah.

25
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:08,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, how about yourself?

26
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:11,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So a few years less than Nell.

27
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:17,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in the newspaper field for about 25 years, a little over 25 years.

28
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:28,723
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was at the Lynn item for 15 years where I was a reporter, I was a beat reporter, and I also had a food column for 14 years, which was a lot of fun.

29
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:35,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Nell, I've covered everything from courts to local government to arts and

30
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:42,927
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, neighborhood disputes, you name it, I've covered it, which is fun.

31
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:46,308
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the fun part about the job, because you never really know what's going to happen in a day.

32
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:52,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at the Marblehead Reporter for seven years as their editor, and since then, I've been freelancing.

33
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:55,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've done- Pretty good stuff.

34
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:57,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like Mel, I've done a lot.

35
00:02:57,132 --> 00:02:59,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't deputy director of anything, but I've done a lot of stuff.

36
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but still pretty good stuff.

37
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:01,654
[SPEAKER_00]: You're way up there.

38
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm up there.

39
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:04,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, definitely, definitely.

40
00:03:05,515 --> 00:03:06,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Wendell, how about you?

41
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:09,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was never deputy director of anything.

42
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:11,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Not even in my house.

43
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,441
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been involved in publishing in one form or another for about 40 years.

44
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:23,424
[SPEAKER_01]: I started my career at a magazine called Modern Materials Handling back in the day.

45
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:29,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And most recently, I've been with, I was with Wicked Local and worked for a number of different papers.

46
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,909
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that time, I mostly was a writer, but I also did

47
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,873
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, videos and photos and I wrote columns and did a podcast, a little of this and a little of that, so.

48
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:49,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Well versed, you're well, you've done it all too, so a lot of experience on this table.

49
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've covered all the bases.

50
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:53,780
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably not a story topic that we haven't covered.

51
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to see what you're going to do for Method.

52
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am, I mean that.

53
00:03:57,221 --> 00:03:58,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to it.

54
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:07,087
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so before we get into Got to Know Method, we're going to learn a lot about what's going on.

55
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:10,868
[SPEAKER_00]: You are all part of local newspapers.

56
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:11,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

57
00:04:11,788 --> 00:04:17,110
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things I always wonder, I think about is, what happened

58
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,513
[SPEAKER_00]: to local newspapers.

59
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:23,395
[SPEAKER_00]: We always went to them.

60
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:24,916
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, forever.

61
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:29,720
[SPEAKER_00]: It's heartbreaking.

62
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,021
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go in the same order.

63
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:32,022
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?

64
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:32,903
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what happened?

65
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:33,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did it happen?

66
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:34,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did it?

67
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:37,066
[SPEAKER_00]: We can tell you why it happened.

68
00:04:37,106 --> 00:04:38,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, please do.

69
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:43,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you have a lot of huge media companies, and they own everything.

70
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:44,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're very

71
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:47,278
[SPEAKER_02]: very busy not doing the news.

72
00:04:47,318 --> 00:04:49,321
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very busy responding to their shareholders.

73
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:54,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more important that the shareholders get their money than residents get their news.

74
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've seen a lot of cutbacks in the industry over the last

75
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:05,420
[SPEAKER_02]: at least 10, 20 years, and it seemed like every time you turn around, there were more cutbacks and more cutbacks.

76
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:18,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And about three or four years ago, our bosses, where we worked, told us that they had come up with focus groups and studies that people were very interested in 15 topics.

77
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:24,029
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're asking me to remember what they are right now, I'm not going to be able to tell you.

78
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,650
[SPEAKER_02]: But... I can only imagine.

79
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,990
[SPEAKER_03]: It was your basic.

80
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,890
[SPEAKER_03]: It was arts.

81
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:29,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It was food.

82
00:05:29,971 --> 00:05:30,851
[SPEAKER_03]: It was travel.

83
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:32,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Development.

84
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:32,952
[SPEAKER_02]: State house.

85
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:33,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Government.

86
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:36,753
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing was, they wanted to go to a regionalized model.

87
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:40,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they wanted, they wanted topic reporters instead of local reporters.

88
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:50,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So they started this program where they split everyone up, and then they started closing smaller titles, and they started to incorporate other titles.

89
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,716
[SPEAKER_02]: And it didn't work.

90
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:54,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It just didn't work.

91
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:56,797
[SPEAKER_02]: And we told them that it wouldn't work.

92
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:57,377
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.

93
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,918
[SPEAKER_02]: When they came up with the idea, we were very vocal.

94
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:01,398
[SPEAKER_02]: We were vocal.

95
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Our readers were vocal.

96
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Our communities were vocal.

97
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:13,361
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't think it would work, and then three months later, they were like, this isn't working, and they laid off about 400 people nationwide.

98
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:14,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Us among them.

99
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:18,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally just think it's terrible, that's all, because... It was heartbreaking.

100
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:19,303
[SPEAKER_00]: Very heartbreaking.

101
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:22,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, our newspapers were huge, as you know.

102
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,365
[SPEAKER_03]: People love their community newspapers.

103
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:26,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

104
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And that disappeared.

105
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:32,127
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was heartbreaking for us because that's what we've done for 25 years.

106
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,388
[SPEAKER_03]: We put our heart and soul into those papers.

107
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:37,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am a complete believer of community news.

108
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's wildly important.

109
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just didn't, which was

110
00:06:42,992 --> 00:06:44,193
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's sad.

111
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,074
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more the statistics.

112
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:47,475
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the studies say.

113
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:48,596
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the stats say.

114
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:52,118
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what the people are saying is what the studies were saying.

115
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:53,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get into the name.

116
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,240
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know the name of the local paper.

117
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,863
[SPEAKER_00]: But every once in a while, I'll go out with a few guys, a cup of coffee, and there's the papers.

118
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:03,665
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'll buy a paper occasionally still, because I like reading newspapers.

119
00:07:05,128 --> 00:07:07,690
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one, but it's not Medford.

120
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,611
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is.

121
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:13,595
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still doing the regional model, but they're not doing the regional model with reporters.

122
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:19,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get two or three people writing a story, and then those people get handed off to someone.

123
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody edits it.

124
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:24,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people look at it and say, we're putting this in every single one of these papers.

125
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:28,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it doesn't matter whether it has a Medford angle.

126
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:29,469
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another form of ghosting.

127
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't see anyone pick the paper up.

128
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:31,470
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.

129
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:36,773
[SPEAKER_03]: They're newspapers without reporters attached.

130
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're ghost papers is what they call them.

131
00:07:38,913 --> 00:07:39,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Zombie papers.

132
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:39,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

133
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:40,834
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

134
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:42,014
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

135
00:07:42,074 --> 00:07:47,516
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, why do you think it's important?

136
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:50,177
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you covered some of it with the last answer.

137
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:51,637
[SPEAKER_00]: But why is it so important?

138
00:07:51,997 --> 00:07:56,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what was the purpose of starting a digital newspaper?

139
00:07:56,598 --> 00:07:57,719
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?

140
00:07:57,799 --> 00:07:59,999
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anyone can take it.

141
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:00,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

142
00:08:00,619 --> 00:08:01,300
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'll start.

143
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,663
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel it's really important that people know what's going on in their community.

144
00:08:07,243 --> 00:08:08,825
[SPEAKER_01]: That's first and foremost.

145
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:21,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we feel that having a newspaper in a community, you're holding the government accountable, which is a piece that's really fallen by the wayside with all the closing of the local newspapers.

146
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,537
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's both of those things.

147
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:25,358
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

148
00:08:25,758 --> 00:08:26,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the country, right?

149
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,442
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it's about building community.

150
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:42,703
[SPEAKER_01]: in Medford and getting to know people and letting them know what's happening, what are events, what meetings, anything big happening at City Hall, all that good stuff.

151
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:43,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important.

152
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:49,388
[SPEAKER_02]: When we formed our company, which is Gotta Know Media, we were looking at different communities.

153
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:56,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing was I live in an adjoining community and I kept coming here and I kept seeing people I know.

154
00:08:56,852 --> 00:08:59,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kept saying to me, oh my gosh, you need to come to Medford.

155
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,174
[SPEAKER_02]: You should come back to Medford.

156
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:02,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Come back to Medford.

157
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:11,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we were doing some research as to where to go, this seemed like the obvious place, because so many people had said, we are just absolutely in need of something here.

158
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:12,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Nell had deep roots here.

159
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

160
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:18,400
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a ripe community, because you're a growing community.

161
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,201
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an ever-changing community.

162
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:24,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just sort of natural sense to come here.

163
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:29,228
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next question I was going to ask is, what's the value?

164
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,592
[SPEAKER_00]: What value are you bringing to method?

165
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,934
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you hit on that though.

166
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:34,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basically.

167
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the value is being here.

168
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,271
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bringing information.

169
00:09:39,411 --> 00:09:42,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's building a community, which is what we hope to do around the paper.

170
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:45,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It's giving people a voice.

171
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:49,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's giving people a place to go to and a voice of their own.

172
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:50,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we want to hear from people, too.

173
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:58,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as much as we want to put information out there and tell you where to go and how to do things and what's going on in your community, we want to hear from you as well.

174
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're starting social media, so that'll be another access point.

175
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:03,048
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.

176
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:06,511
[SPEAKER_00]: So what contributions are you looking to make?

177
00:10:06,531 --> 00:10:13,938
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, you know, basic answer is, you know, you're going to make a contribution.

178
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,260
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you feel your contribution is going to be?

179
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,243
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to rebuild the community.

180
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:23,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everyone feels very divisive.

181
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:28,028
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not a lot of respect for what someone's opinions might be.

182
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,189
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to rebuild that.

183
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:34,331
[SPEAKER_02]: When I worked in Medford a million years ago, people were respectful.

184
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:35,852
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't agree.

185
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Never have they agreed.

186
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,554
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were respectful of each other.

187
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:44,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And people would come to the paper for, oh, my kid did this.

188
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:47,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did you know that this person is doing that?

189
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:50,919
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a real sense of community in the paper.

190
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:56,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And we always gave people their voice to send in columns or send in letters to the editor.

191
00:10:57,002 --> 00:10:58,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we are looking to rebuild.

192
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:07,447
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking to be the forum for people to come and send us their information, let us know that their grandpa had an 80th birthday.

193
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:13,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we want to be that, I guess, that bridge, that bridge to the community.

194
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:34,993
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're looking to cover everything sports i mean yeah yeah we just recently hired a sports reporter actually so we have um have started covering sports i do a lot of as much of the art scene as i can so reach out to me please because i love to cover local artists and local um theater groups and whatnot but and definitely city hall is you know is a big part of that

195

[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, anything and everything.

196
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:40,776
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting to hire a couple of freelancers as well.

197
00:11:40,876 --> 00:11:41,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.

198
00:11:41,396 --> 00:11:41,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that.

199
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:42,816
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't aware.

200
00:11:42,856 --> 00:11:44,197
[SPEAKER_02]: We literally just started that.

201
00:11:44,257 --> 00:11:48,718
[SPEAKER_02]: We have somebody covering the Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year Banquet on Tuesday.

202
00:11:48,978 --> 00:11:49,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

203
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:56,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And our recent hire for a sports guy is Chris Hurley, who is here for a million years with the transcript.

204
00:11:57,081 --> 00:12:01,102
[SPEAKER_03]: He is very well versed in sports in the city of Medford.

205
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:03,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, which is nice.

206
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:06,664
[SPEAKER_03]: It gives us some starting roots here.

207
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,306
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I ask you what your target audience is?

208
00:12:11,226 --> 00:12:13,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody!

209
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:15,488
[SPEAKER_03]: We want everybody!

210
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:16,529
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

211
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:20,030
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a true community newspaper in that sense.

212
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:23,192
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I said we want to cover everything.

213
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,153
[SPEAKER_03]: How much of that we get to and how much we do well depends on...

214
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:29,095
[SPEAKER_03]: We're three people.

215
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're three people right now, so keep that in mind.

216
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:35,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Three people with full-time jobs and doing this because we love it.

217
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,502
[SPEAKER_02]: We love what we do.

218
00:12:36,582 --> 00:12:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're hoping that this will become our full-time job before long.

219
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:44,570
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so, too, because I think you're going to be very successful.

[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.

225
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:56,160
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the information you're putting out already, and you've just gotten started.

226
00:12:56,761 --> 00:12:57,642
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to be diverse.

227
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:05,768
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to do a little bit of sports, a little bit of arts, a little bit of City Hall, you know, information we think people need.

228
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:10,730
[SPEAKER_03]: working on getting into the schools, love to cover stuff in the schools, so hopefully we'll be doing that.

229
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Important stuff, yeah.

230
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:19,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just not even just school committee meetings, I mean those are always important, what's going on policy-wise, budget-wise, but also in the classroom.

231
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:21,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to see what kids are doing in the classroom.

232
00:13:21,694 --> 00:13:23,735
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, let's see how those tax dollars are being spent.

233
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:25,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's show the cool and the fun stuff.

234
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have the vocational school right here.

235
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:30,577
[SPEAKER_03]: They do amazing, they are doing some amazing things.

236
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:32,598
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a show on them, yeah.

237
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:33,418
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tremendous.

238
00:13:33,478 --> 00:13:36,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave invited me in, so I can't wait to get over there and do something.

239
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's nice.

240
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,861
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a, yeah.

241
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:41,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

242
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:46,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be, for me, it's great to just be reconnecting with people that I've known for a really long time.

243
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:52,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just so much fun to have them connect and say, hey, we'd like to meet for coffee.

244
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,992
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got, you know, we've got some ideas.

245
00:13:54,092 --> 00:14:00,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we definitely, we've actually gotten a lot of email from people who have said, how can we help?

246
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:02,218
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we support you?

247
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:02,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So nice.

248
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:05,200
[SPEAKER_02]: which is very, very nice.

249
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,260
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we be part?

250
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a writer, but what can I do?

251
00:14:09,122 --> 00:14:11,604
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I do to help you keep growing?

252
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:16,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you girls are gonna be very successful.

253
00:14:17,547 --> 00:14:23,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, this city has been looking for you for a long time.

254
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:24,972
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to meet you in person.

255
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,254
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the whole city to meet you in person.

256
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:30,236
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it is, it's important.

257
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:34,559
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, and what you're set out to do is, you know, it's great.

258
00:14:36,081 --> 00:14:41,665
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, I got a tough question, because I always, I always think about it.

259
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:43,907
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask a lot of tough questions.

260
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:52,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, so, you know, you're doing what you're doing, and you're starting out, and it's, you know, slowly building up.

261
00:14:54,115 --> 00:14:56,196
[SPEAKER_00]: What, who makes, who's making the decisions?

262
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,641
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you decide?

263
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:02,065
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you decide what gets in the paper, what doesn't go in the paper?

264
00:15:02,105 --> 00:15:04,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone, I mean... We talk a lot.

265
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:05,229
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.

266
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:06,410
[SPEAKER_03]: We text willy-nilly.

267
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:26,168
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always curious like when we started in the beginning We made a pact the three of us made a pact that we would always be honest with each other Even if we didn't want to hear it and that majority rules if we ever come to You know a decision that we can't reach right away.

268
00:15:26,188 --> 00:15:31,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um, and that's really I mean we've sort of been working for about two years, so That's really

269
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's taken us a while to get this up and running.

270
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:36,595
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we just started.

271
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:43,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a lot of work, and most people don't realize the amount of work that you have to do even before you get on.

272
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,721
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk every day.

273
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:47,062
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, hey, I'm going to do this story about that.

274
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:50,825
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a running list of stories in our budget, so we check that a lot.

275
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:54,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, we're texting and calling each other all the time.

276
00:15:54,808 --> 00:15:56,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are questions.

277
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:59,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we recently had a

278
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:10,822
[SPEAKER_03]: submission that we are discussing on whether we want to put it in or not, whether this is a good time to run it, or maybe we want to sit on it for a little bit.

279
00:16:11,142 --> 00:16:16,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, there are things that, you know, and a lot of that comes with the experience and experience that we've had.

280
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:17,504
[SPEAKER_03]: We've made those mistakes.

281
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's right.

282
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

283
00:16:20,726 --> 00:16:23,807
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we do get in a place where we can't really settle it,

284
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:26,508
[SPEAKER_01]: We drop the gloves and we settle in on the ice.

285
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:27,408
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, I love it.

286
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I love doing business like that.

287
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:31,349
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.

288
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,129
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.

289
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:33,930
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.

290
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,990
[SPEAKER_03]: We have yet to drag Nell out on the ice yet.

291
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:37,971
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another great question.

292
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what happens?

293
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:43,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever come to this, you know, all three years agree?

294
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:44,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that ever happen?

295
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:44,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.

296
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, frequently, yeah.

297
00:16:46,294 --> 00:16:46,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.

298
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:51,799
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we make such a good team is that we have a lot of the same sort of sensibilities.

299
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're pretty much on the same page.

300
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:54,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

301
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:55,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've worked together for a long time.

302
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:56,325
[SPEAKER_02]: We've worked together for a long time.

303
00:16:56,345 --> 00:16:56,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

304
00:16:56,746 --> 00:16:58,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've worked together for about a decade, almost a decade.

305
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:02,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's always like, seems like, you know, one person always

306
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:03,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

307
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:04,948
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is good.

308
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:05,969
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, this is good.

309
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:08,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Three is always working together.

310
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:08,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

311
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we used to we used to at one point be a foursome.

312
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,571
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, our other person decided she she just couldn't do it.

313
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:16,311
[SPEAKER_02]: She couldn't.

314
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:17,452
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big leap.

315
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,272
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work.

316
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:21,793
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do understand.

317
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:21,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

318
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:22,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,

319
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:29,198
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't, but I appreciate it and I think the whole city, I really do.

320
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:30,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to be welcomed.

321
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:37,524
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once the word gets out there about what you're doing, how you're doing it, why you're doing it, I really do.

322
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:41,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, oh, I want it to take off because we need a newspaper.

323
00:17:41,347 --> 00:17:42,828
[SPEAKER_02]: People have been very welcoming.

324
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:43,489
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been wonderful.

325
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:49,132
[SPEAKER_02]: We've received a lot, like I said, a lot of feedback from people just saying hi.

326
00:17:49,172 --> 00:17:51,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say hello.

327
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, they've been welcoming, very much so.

328
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:57,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, we haven't been around long enough to irritate anyone yet either, so there's that.

329
00:17:58,157 --> 00:17:59,358
[SPEAKER_03]: We're ready for that.

330
00:17:59,418 --> 00:17:59,918
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know.

331
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:01,899
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's going to happen too, but you've got to expect that.

332
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:02,799
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're used to that.

333
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:03,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

334
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,961
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, measuring success.

335
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:08,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how do you measure it?

336
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:12,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you now and where do you want to go?

337
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:17,088
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's the basics of analytics, of just looking at your analytics.

338
00:18:17,108 --> 00:18:19,450
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see who's reading what, how long they're staying in a story.

339
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,892
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing if you pay attention to your analytics, what it can tell you.

340
00:18:23,593 --> 00:18:24,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's that.

341
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:25,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Feedback.

342
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:26,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Feedback.

343
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:29,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you said, so far the feedback has all been good.

344
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,178
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all been well.

345
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:33,441
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of word of mouth.

346
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,864
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so happy to be on your show.

347
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:44,091
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a couple of interviews with some local papers, but we haven't really done publicity.

348
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:48,475
[SPEAKER_03]: meet the editor.

349
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Coffee and donuts kind of thing, but we just haven't done it yet.

350
00:18:51,996 --> 00:18:53,337
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been too busy.

351
00:18:53,457 --> 00:19:11,623
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we definitely want to do, and I think we're going to be doing this in the fall, because right now since we're coming on summer, not a lot of people around, we're hoping to do a News Deserts workshop at the library with Dan Kennedy and Ellen, what is Ellen's last name?

352
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:21,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Ellen Clegg, yes, they wrote a book about news deserts and the library is, we've been working with them a little bit about doing something and introduce ourselves to more people.

353
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,041
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a beautiful library.

354
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:23,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it really is, yeah.

355
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,243
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been word of mouth.

356
00:19:25,403 --> 00:19:29,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing people don't know about, it is all word of mouth, but I've been up there quite a bit.

357
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:32,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've done things with other people.

358
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:33,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Go and check out your library.

359
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:33,946
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.

360
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:34,386
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

361
00:19:34,426 --> 00:19:35,786
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to check it out.

362
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,327
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a show on the library.

363
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:38,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we really did.

364
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wow.

365
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:41,429
[SPEAKER_00]: And the staff is so great.

366
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:42,510
[SPEAKER_03]: And they offer so much.

367
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,270
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.

368
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,631
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't realize what they offer.

369
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,652
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something for everyone.

370
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,513
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is today.

371
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been very supportive of us, too.

372
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,756
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say it like I do, library.

373
00:19:54,396 --> 00:19:55,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, library.

374
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think it's library.

375
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:58,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't tell me.

376
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,839
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not library.

377
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,679
[SPEAKER_00]: It never was.

378
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,080
[SPEAKER_00]: It's library.

379
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,982
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's library.

380
00:20:06,082 --> 00:20:06,923
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no, no.

381
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:11,104
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so, you know, the feedback's been good.

382
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,104
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that.

383
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,406
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the difficulties?

384
00:20:17,446 --> 00:20:23,368
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's got to be, I mean, you got to have days where it's, you know, what obstacles are you facing?

385
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:27,369
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are your biggest obstacles, difficulties?

386
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:33,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from sitting in front of the computer for three hours and realizing you don't have a paragraph?

387
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:36,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Because writing is so easy.

388
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It's difficult.

389
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,955
[SPEAKER_02]: People aren't used to having a newspaper in their computer anymore.

390
00:20:43,536 --> 00:20:55,741
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just reading, I was just reading an article in Pointner which had this fabulous thing saying, you know, more and more of these independent little newspapers are finding that they're hitting their head against a wall.

391
00:20:55,801 --> 00:21:03,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because so many of those communities, when they lost their papers, they switched, you know, town officials.

392
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:05,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So town officials aren't used to being accountable.

393
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:06,865
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not used to talking to newspapers.

394
00:21:06,905 --> 00:21:07,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't think they have to.

395
00:21:07,905 --> 00:21:08,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't think they have to.

396
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:09,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

397
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:10,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

398
00:21:10,386 --> 00:21:12,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can just take this as a fair warning.

399
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:14,409
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't.

400
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:20,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would be very nice if they would return phone calls and answer our questions.

401
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:22,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not out to get anybody.

402
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just out to tell a story.

403
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:28,490
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea that we won't do the story because they won't call us, yeah, that's a myth.

404
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:31,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're going to do the story anyway.

405
00:21:31,512 --> 00:21:38,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nicer to do it with, you know, with all the voices that we can get, because that's really, again, that's what we want to do.

406
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:40,600
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be the voice for the community.

407
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,042
[SPEAKER_03]: We want the community to have its voice.

408
00:21:42,162 --> 00:21:43,683
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll write the stories anyway.

409
00:21:44,223 --> 00:21:46,605
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no urgency to return calls.

410
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:47,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

411
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,828
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what's your experience?

412
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:53,612
[SPEAKER_00]: City Hall, you know, the local government, I mean, are they

413
00:21:54,586 --> 00:21:55,667
[SPEAKER_00]: To be diplomatic.

414
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:56,627
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the feeling?

415
00:21:56,827 --> 00:21:57,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they helping you out?

416
00:21:58,028 --> 00:21:59,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they welcoming you?

417
00:21:59,129 --> 00:22:00,229
[SPEAKER_00]: They're welcoming.

418
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:01,570
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very welcoming.

419
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think so.

420
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:06,613
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're also very structured in the way that you have to request news.

421
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:11,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't just call up someone that you want to talk to.

422
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:15,498
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go through a certain process.

423
00:22:16,758 --> 00:22:18,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is very frustrating.

424
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes you're just asking a very innocuous question.

425
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could just literally call up that person.

426
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,521
[SPEAKER_02]: What day is the garbage picked up?

427
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:28,122
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I just need to talk to a guy from DPW.

428
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:31,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're running through this maze of just trying to get that.

429
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:33,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the interesting part.

430
00:22:33,683 --> 00:22:41,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we're asking these very simple questions, and they can't answer them without going through a bunch of hoops, how are they going to answer a hard question?

431
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:49,673
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean... I mean, I have been told by somebody that I can't answer that because... Yeah, sometimes I think it's because they're afraid to answer.

432
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:51,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're afraid to say something wrong.

433
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:51,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the basic stuff.

434
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,956
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've literally been told.

435
00:22:53,036 --> 00:22:54,277
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they've literally been told.

436
00:22:54,317 --> 00:23:00,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I know that I asked a very simple question of someone recently and he told me, I can't tell you that because I can't, I'm not supposed to be talking to you.

437
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:05,385
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a good thing.

438
00:23:05,465 --> 00:23:06,826
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not transparency.

439
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:11,388
[SPEAKER_03]: For a community that keeps saying it wants transparency, that's not transparency.

440
00:23:11,408 --> 00:23:13,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be honest.

441
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get into a whole bunch of things but I won't.

442
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:20,073
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're hoping that we'll win them over.

443
00:23:20,213 --> 00:23:22,735
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like you're pulling teeth to get information.

444
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:24,736
[SPEAKER_02]: And it shouldn't be that way.

445
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:25,576
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be easy.

446
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:28,318
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not afraid to go after that information either.

447
00:23:28,358 --> 00:23:35,122
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing that I think people, like Chris was saying, I think some people say, well, if I don't give them the information, they're not, that's not true.

448
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:42,785
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you're going anywhere.

449
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:47,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, there's probably not a situation we haven't come across in our years.

450
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:51,208
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's like what we do.

451
00:23:51,468 --> 00:23:53,229
[SPEAKER_00]: All we're doing is giving you information.

452
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:54,389
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving out facts.

453
00:23:54,449 --> 00:23:56,350
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not out to get you.

454
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:56,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

455
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,150
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's out to get anybody.

456
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:06,838
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened, why it happened, how it happened, who did it, who it's impacting, how it's going to hurt you, or help you.

457
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:15,647
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be fair, this is something that's happening in communities all across Massachusetts, that governments are becoming less

458
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:16,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

459
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:17,968
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, less transparent.

460
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:19,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is totally not.

461
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:20,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much so.

462
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:20,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with that.

463
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,510
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everybody.

464
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everybody.

465
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Lonely, it's a horror show.

466
00:24:23,871 --> 00:24:31,895
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of our colleagues that were also let go from the same conglomerate have started up neighboring papers and they're running into the same thing in their communities.

467
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:32,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

468
00:24:33,156 --> 00:24:39,701
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very big independent newspaper community out there right now, and it's growing by leaps and bounds.

469
00:24:39,721 --> 00:24:40,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it needs to.

470
00:24:40,902 --> 00:24:41,663
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.

471
00:24:41,743 --> 00:24:44,625
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful to see.

472
00:24:44,745 --> 00:24:48,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I, myself, for example, I'm a part-time editor for the Winchester News.

473
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:50,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I didn't know that.

474
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:51,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned something new today.

475
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my other job, right.

476
00:24:53,772 --> 00:25:13,100
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I've seen, and we've been to some different workshops and some different conferences of all these little places, and sometimes it's just people in the community with no journalism experience, and they'll start it up, and then they'll look for somebody like us, journalists, to come and help them be able to pull it all together.

477
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's at different stages.

478
00:25:15,502 --> 00:25:19,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have people like Brookline, which they've been doing it for a really long time.

479
00:25:20,608 --> 00:25:26,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have people with, you know, million dollar resources, who are doing an amazing job.

480
00:25:26,415 --> 00:25:30,580
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I found is everyone has been very supportive and very helpful.

481
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, people have helped us along the line.

482
00:25:34,664 --> 00:25:38,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, in turn, have had people call us and say, well, how do you do this?

483
00:25:39,666 --> 00:25:41,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking to start something in my community.

484
00:25:41,547 --> 00:25:42,368
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do it?

485
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:52,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll either give them the information that was sort of helped us, or we basically turn them over to somebody who's a little further ahead of us and who might have that information.

486
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:57,175
[SPEAKER_02]: It has become very, very much so of a supportive little community.

487
00:25:57,195 --> 00:25:57,475
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

488
00:25:57,495 --> 00:26:02,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's good for us, especially because a number of the people that we used to work with, who we miss,

489
00:26:04,118 --> 00:26:10,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I have now started publication, so we can reconnect.

490
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,745
[SPEAKER_00]: The last question I really have, and I thank you.

491
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:17,007
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been wonderful talking to you.

492
00:26:18,348 --> 00:26:19,689
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're coming back, right?

493
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:20,249
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.

494
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,170
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to.

495
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:27,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a great thing what you're doing.

496
00:26:27,156 --> 00:26:31,241
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the city of Medford needs this.

497
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:33,363
[SPEAKER_00]: We've wanted it for a long time.

498
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:45,732
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, what are you looking to impact as far as the way this, you know, things in the city, what do you think your impact will be?

499
00:26:46,473 --> 00:26:49,715
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanna bring the community back together and give them a forum.

500
00:26:49,755 --> 00:27:01,582
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first started at the transcript as its editor, my whole goal was to give the city and everyone in the paper, it's not our paper, it's your voice, right?

501
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,403
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanna give people their voice.

502
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:06,505
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as Wendell keeps saying, it's your community.

503
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:08,807
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just reporting the news.

504
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:12,350
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff is happening in your community, right?

505
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,111
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't live here.

506
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:15,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your tax dollars.

507
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:17,434
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and we're reporting it.

508
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:22,899
[SPEAKER_02]: We're giving you the information so that, you know, you keep saying, you know, to make the decisions you need to make.

509
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the impact that we hope to have.

510
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And you all know how much is going on.

511
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:30,204
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had the charter, all the zoning.

512
00:27:30,244 --> 00:27:32,125
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot going on.

513
00:27:32,145 --> 00:27:38,449
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to wrap our heads around all of it, watching old past meetings and stuff to try to get a handle on what's going on.

514
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:47,395
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone wants similar things, but they're so far apart in this city.

515
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:51,478
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see improvements, but you want to see them in a certain way.

516
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:54,620
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be some balance.

517
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,461
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no balance.

518
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:56,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there has to be.

519
00:27:57,202 --> 00:28:07,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other impact, I mean, I'd like to see is, you know, I want people to think of us, you know, something happens, like Nell said, you've got something good in your life happens, something bad in your life happens, you want to know what's going on next door.

520
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:08,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

521
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:09,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Call us.

522
00:28:09,732 --> 00:28:10,073

[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been a good response.

[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when we've called people, I'm like, I'm from Ghana, no Medford.

[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll be like, what's that?

[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll say the new paper, the new paper.

[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, it's been good.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they've been very, very appreciative.

[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it makes you it makes you sort of feel like you're on the right track.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

550
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:36,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm so glad you don't know how happy I am that you came on the show I want you know people got to know what you're doing.

551
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,933
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why you're doing the whole the whole thing and I

552
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,534
[SPEAKER_00]: I am thrilled that you came on.

553
00:29:41,554 --> 00:29:45,416
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got the message out there somewhat.

554
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:47,157
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue to get the message.

555
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:47,837
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back.

556
00:29:48,137 --> 00:29:50,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you will be back.

557
00:29:50,478 --> 00:29:52,540
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be back on a regular basis.

558
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,560
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a fine feeling.

559
00:29:57,622 --> 00:30:04,205
[SPEAKER_00]: go good for everyone, not just you, but for MedFed, you know, everybody.

560
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:06,947
[SPEAKER_02]: The response has been phenomenal.

561
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:15,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when Chris and I pressed the button to go live, we were shocked because we had 300 subscribers in two days.

562
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:18,012
[SPEAKER_02]: We did it on a Friday.

563
00:30:18,513 --> 00:30:22,995
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just like, I was in my car driving somewhere and she called me and she's like,

564
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:25,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Florida visiting my parents.

565
00:30:25,976 --> 00:30:27,617
[SPEAKER_03]: She was like, we're ready to go.

566
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:28,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I press the button?

567
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:30,478
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, sure, go ahead, press the button.

568
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:33,099
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very, yeah, it wasn't very exciting.

569
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,380
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't pop a champagne or anything.

570
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,920
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it's a good story.

571
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,881
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great start.

572
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:40,582
[SPEAKER_03]: And then by Sunday, we had over 300 people.

573
00:30:40,802 --> 00:30:41,562
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been great.

574
00:30:41,702 --> 00:30:42,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been fabulous.

575
00:30:42,602 --> 00:30:43,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said,

576
00:30:44,283 --> 00:30:49,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I know, I know, we got to end the show.

577
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:55,654
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just want to thank you, Nell, Chris, Wendell.

578
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,436
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, it's been a great show.

579
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:03,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did a lot of good things informing people.

580
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,760
[SPEAKER_00]: They know your faces now, that's what you do better.

581
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a good thing?

582
00:31:09,981 --> 00:31:13,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Might even get more recognized.

583
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:15,524
[SPEAKER_00]: You have people bothering you all the time.

584
00:31:19,446 --> 00:31:21,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyhow, thank you very much.

585
00:31:21,567 --> 00:31:24,649
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, thank you very much.

586

[SPEAKER_00]: You're very welcome, you're very welcome.

587
00:31:28,131 --> 00:31:29,352
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna take a minute.
