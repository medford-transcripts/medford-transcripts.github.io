    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=28.343s">Hello</a>  everyone and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=34.908s">I</a>  am John Petrella. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=37.109s">The</a>  purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information to help you make informed choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=45.896s">Today</a>  we have not one, but three very, very special guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=52.629s">Nell</a>  Escobar Coakley, Chris Stevens, and Wendell Waters, founders of Gotta Know Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=62.151s">They</a>  will be speaking about their new venture and what it's gonna bring to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=68.873s">So</a>  let me begin, I'm gonna begin, I'll ask each of you, tell us a little bit about yourself and your background. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=76.935s">And</a>  we'll start with Nell.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=78.925s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=80.145s">Well,</a>  I have been in the field of journalism for more than 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=85.447s">I</a>  was the editor of the Medford Transcript for 17 years and was with the paper for 20 years, so pretty well versed in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=95.091s">I</a>  know a lot of the folks here and I'm really glad to be back in a news capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=101.233s">I've</a>  worked in all sorts of different fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=105.475s">I've</a>  been a freelancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=106.575s">I've</a>  done stories about everything under the sun. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=108.576s">I</a>  was a managing editor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=110.417s">And</a>  at my very last sort of position working for a big newspaper company, I was the deputy director of Massachusetts State News.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=119.041s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=119.421s">So</a>  you've done it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=120.742s">You</a>  got some experience, some great experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=122.943s">Just</a>  a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=123.824s">Yeah,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=124.284s">Just</a>  a little bit of experience, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=125.784s">OK,</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=127.812s">Chris,</a>  how about yourself?</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=129.473s">So</a>  a few years less than Nell. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=132.194s">I've</a>  been in the newspaper field for about 25 years, a little over 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=138.418s">So</a>  I was at the Lynn item for 15 years where I was a reporter, I was a beat reporter, and I also had a food column for 14 years, which was a lot of fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=149.463s">Like</a>  Nell, I've covered everything from courts to local government to arts and <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=157.825s">everything,</a>  neighborhood disputes, you name it, I've covered it, which is fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=162.987s">It's</a>  the fun part about the job, because you never really know what's going to happen in a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=167.148s">I</a>  was at the Marblehead Reporter for seven years as their editor, and since then, I've been freelancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=173.211s">So</a>  I've done- Pretty good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=175.611s">Yeah,</a>  like Mel, I've done a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=177.132s">I</a>  wasn't deputy director of anything, but I've done a lot of stuff.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=179.653s">Yeah,</a>  but still pretty good stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=181.133s">You're</a>  way up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=181.714s">I'm</a>  up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=182.294s">Oh</a>  yeah, definitely, definitely.</p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=185.515s">Wendell,</a>  how about you? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=186.556s">Yeah,</a>  I was never deputy director of anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=190.998s">Not</a>  even in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=192.759s">But</a>  I've been involved in publishing in one form or another for about 40 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=197.521s">I</a>  started my career at a magazine called Modern Materials Handling back in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=204.065s">And</a>  most recently, I've been with, I was with Wicked Local and worked for a number of different papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=210.168s">And</a>  during that time, I mostly was a writer, but I also did <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=214.17s">you</a>  know, videos and photos and I wrote columns and did a podcast, a little of this and a little of that, so.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=221.654s">Well</a>  versed, you're well, you've done it all too, so a lot of experience on this table.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=229.297s">Yeah,</a>  we've covered all the bases. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=230.658s">That's</a>  probably not a story topic that we haven't covered.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=233.9s">I'm</a>  looking forward to see what you're going to do for Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=236.021s">I</a>  really am, I mean that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=237.221s">I'm</a>  looking forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=239.024s">All</a>  right, so before we get into Got to Know Method, we're going to learn a lot about what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=248.207s">You</a>  are all part of local newspapers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=251.068s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=251.788s">And</a>  one of the things I always wonder, I think about is, what happened <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=258.09s">to</a>  local newspapers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=262.254s">We</a>  always went to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=263.795s">I</a>  mean, forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=266.097s">It's</a>  heartbreaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=269.74s">We</a>  can go in the same order. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=271.362s">What</a>  do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=272.082s">I</a>  mean, what happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=272.943s">Why</a>  did it happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=274.044s">Who</a>  did it? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=274.905s">We</a>  can tell you why it happened.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=277.106s">Please,</a>  please do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=278.347s">Well,</a>  you have a lot of huge media companies, and they own everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=283.452s">And</a>  they're very <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=285.315s">very</a>  busy not doing the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=287.318s">They're</a>  very busy responding to their shareholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=289.561s">So</a>  it's more important that the shareholders get their money than residents get their news. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=295.79s">So</a>  we've seen a lot of cutbacks in the industry over the last <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=300.257s">at</a>  least 10, 20 years, and it seemed like every time you turn around, there were more cutbacks and more cutbacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=306.22s">And</a>  about three or four years ago, our bosses, where we worked, told us that they had come up with focus groups and studies that people were very interested in 15 topics. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=321.348s">If</a>  you're asking me to remember what they are right now, I'm not going to be able to tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=324.249s">But...</a>  I can only imagine.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=325.99s">It</a>  was your basic. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=328.11s">It</a>  was arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=329.111s">It</a>  was food. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=329.971s">It</a>  was travel.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=331.711s">Development.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=332.451s">State</a>  house. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=332.992s">Government.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=333.812s">But</a>  the thing was, they wanted to go to a regionalized model. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=336.773s">So</a>  what they wanted, they wanted topic reporters instead of local reporters. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=341.414s">So</a>  they started this program where they split everyone up, and then they started closing smaller titles, and they started to incorporate other titles. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=350.876s">And</a>  it didn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=353.177s">It</a>  just didn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=354.217s">And</a>  we told them that it wouldn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=357.157s">We</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=357.417s">When</a>  they came up with the idea, we were very vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=360.618s">We</a>  were vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=362.018s">Our</a>  readers were vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=363.319s">Our</a>  communities were vocal. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=365.619s">We</a>  didn't think it would work, and then three months later, they were like, this isn't working, and they laid off about 400 people nationwide. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=373.601s">Us</a>  among them.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=374.642s">I</a>  personally just think it's terrible, that's all, because... It was heartbreaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=378.563s">Very</a>  heartbreaking.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=379.643s">I</a>  mean, our newspapers were huge, as you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=384.124s">People</a>  love their community newspapers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=386.385s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=386.705s">And</a>  that disappeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=388.786s">And</a>  it was heartbreaking for us because that's what we've done for 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=392.167s">We</a>  put our heart and soul into those papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=394.508s">And</a>  I am a complete believer of community news. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=397.79s">I</a>  think it's wildly important. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=399.871s">And</a>  they just didn't, which was</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=402.992s">No,</a>  it's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=404.433s">It</a>  was more the statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=406.274s">This</a>  is what the studies say. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=407.495s">This</a>  is what the stats say.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=408.616s">No,</a>  what the people are saying is what the studies were saying.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=412.198s">I'm</a>  not going to get into the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=413.379s">I</a>  don't even know the name of the local paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=415.28s">But</a>  every once in a while, I'll go out with a few guys, a cup of coffee, and there's the papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=419.923s">And,</a>  you know, I'll buy a paper occasionally still, because I like reading newspapers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=425.128s">We</a>  have one, but it's not Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=427.77s">I</a>  don't know what it is.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=428.631s">They're</a>  still doing the regional model, but they're not doing the regional model with reporters. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=434.056s">So</a>  you get two or three people writing a story, and then those people get handed off to someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=439.2s">Somebody</a>  edits it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=440.461s">Those</a>  people look at it and say, we're putting this in every single one of these papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=445.565s">And</a>  so it doesn't matter whether it has a Medford angle.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=448.268s">It's</a>  another form of ghosting.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=449.489s">Well,</a>  I don't see anyone pick the paper up.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=451.27s">It's</a>  there.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=453.872s">They're</a>  newspapers without reporters attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=457.153s">So</a>  they're ghost papers is what they call them. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=458.913s">Zombie</a>  papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=459.674s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=460.354s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=461.714s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=462.074s">So,</a>  you know, why do you think it's important? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=467.876s">I</a>  mean, I think you covered some of it with the last answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=470.217s">But</a>  why is it so important? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=471.997s">I</a>  mean, what was the purpose of starting a digital newspaper? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=476.598s">What</a>  do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=477.799s">I</a>  mean, anyone can take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=480.039s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=480.619s">I</a>  guess I'll start. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=483.38s">We</a>  feel it's really important that people know what's going on in their community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=487.243s">That's</a>  first and foremost. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=489.565s">And</a>  also, we feel that having a newspaper in a community, you're holding the government accountable, which is a piece that's really fallen by the wayside with all the closing of the local newspapers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=502.235s">So</a>  it's both of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=504.897s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=505.758s">Across</a>  the country, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=507.88s">So</a>  for us, it's about building community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=512.437s">in</a>  Medford and getting to know people and letting them know what's happening, what are events, what meetings, anything big happening at City Hall, all that good stuff.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=522.723s">It's</a>  important. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=523.844s">When</a>  we formed our company, which is Gotta Know Media, we were looking at different communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=529.988s">And</a>  the interesting thing was I live in an adjoining community and I kept coming here and I kept seeing people I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=536.852s">And</a>  they kept saying to me, oh my gosh, you need to come to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=539.973s">You</a>  should come back to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=541.214s">Come</a>  back to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=542.614s">So</a>  when we were doing some research as to where to go, this seemed like the obvious place, because so many people had said, we are just absolutely in need of something here.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=551.738s">I</a>  mean, Nell had deep roots here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=553.258s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=554.699s">And</a>  it's a ripe community, because you're a growing community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=558.66s">You're</a>  an ever-changing community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=561.381s">So</a>  it was just sort of natural sense to come here.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=566.103s">And</a>  the next question I was going to ask is, what's the value? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=569.509s">What</a>  value are you bringing to method? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=571.612s">I</a>  think you hit on that though. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=573.575s">I</a>  mean, basically.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=575.548s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, the value is being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=577.93s">It's</a>  bringing information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=579.411s">It's</a>  building a community, which is what we hope to do around the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=583.394s">It's</a>  giving people a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=586.156s">It's</a>  giving people a place to go to and a voice of their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=589.278s">Because</a>  we want to hear from people, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=590.799s">I</a>  mean, as much as we want to put information out there and tell you where to go and how to do things and what's going on in your community, we want to hear from you as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=599.766s">And</a>  we're starting social media, so that'll be another access point.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=602.648s">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=604.129s">So</a>  what contributions are you looking to make? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=606.531s">If</a>  I, you know, basic answer is, you know, you're going to make a contribution. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=614.158s">What</a>  do you feel your contribution is going to be?</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=616.72s">We</a>  want to rebuild the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=620.263s">I</a>  mean, everyone feels very divisive. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=624.046s">And</a>  there's not a lot of respect for what someone's opinions might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=628.528s">But</a>  we want to rebuild that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=630.209s">When</a>  I worked in Medford a million years ago, people were respectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=634.972s">They</a>  didn't agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=636.332s">Never</a>  have they agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=637.753s">But</a>  they were respectful of each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=639.954s">And</a>  people would come to the paper for, oh, my kid did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=644.857s">Or</a>  did you know that this person is doing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=648.138s">And</a>  there was a real sense of community in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=651.059s">And</a>  we always gave people their voice to send in columns or send in letters to the editor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=657.002s">And</a>  that's what we are looking to rebuild. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=659.003s">We're</a>  looking to be the forum for people to come and send us their information, let us know that their grandpa had an 80th birthday. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=667.927s">You</a>  know, we want to be that, I guess, that bridge, that bridge to the community.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=674.53s">and</a>  you're looking to cover everything sports i mean yeah yeah we just recently hired a sports reporter actually so we have um have started covering sports i do a lot of as much of the art scene as i can so reach out to me please because i love to cover local artists and local um theater groups and whatnot but and definitely city hall is you know is a big part of that <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=695.654s">But</a>  yeah, anything and everything.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=697.555s">We're</a>  starting to hire a couple of freelancers as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=700.876s">Oh,</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=701.396s">I</a>  didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=702.016s">I</a>  wasn't aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=702.856s">We</a>  literally just started that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=704.257s">We</a>  have somebody covering the Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year Banquet on Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=708.978s">Nice.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=709.938s">And</a>  our recent hire for a sports guy is Chris Hurley, who is here for a million years with the transcript.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=717.081s">He</a>  is very well versed in sports in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=722.562s">Again,</a>  which is nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=723.483s">It</a>  gives us some starting roots here.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=727.585s">So</a>  if I ask you what your target audience is?</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=908.677s">I'm</a>  always curious like when we started in the beginning We made a pact the three of us made a pact that we would always be honest with each other Even if we didn't want to hear it and that majority rules if we ever come to You know a decision that we can't reach right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=926.188s">Yeah,</a>  um, and that's really I mean we've sort of been working for about two years, so That's really</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=932.512s">Yeah,</a>  it's taken us a while to get this up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=934.493s">It's</a>  not like we just started.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=936.695s">I</a>  know it's a lot of work, and most people don't realize the amount of work that you have to do even before you get on.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=943.96s">We</a>  talk every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=944.881s">So</a>  it's, hey, I'm going to do this story about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=947.142s">We</a>  have a running list of stories in our budget, so we check that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=951.365s">And</a>  like I said, we're texting and calling each other all the time.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=954.808s">And</a>  there are questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=957.049s">I</a>  mean, we recently had a <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=960.298s">submission</a>  that we are discussing on whether we want to put it in or not, whether this is a good time to run it, or maybe we want to sit on it for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=971.142s">So,</a>  yeah, there are things that, you know, and a lot of that comes with the experience and experience that we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=976.424s">We've</a>  made those mistakes.</p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=977.584s">Yeah,</a>  that's right.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=979.265s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=980.726s">And</a>  if we do get in a place where we can't really settle it, <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=984.787s">We</a>  drop the gloves and we settle in on the ice.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=986.548s">There</a>  you go, I love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=988.488s">I</a>  love doing business like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=990.229s">That's</a>  beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=991.529s">I</a>  love that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=992.209s">I</a>  really do.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=996.611s">I</a>  have another great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=998.611s">Okay,</a>  what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1000.172s">Have</a>  you ever come to this, you know, all three years agree? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1003.493s">Does</a>  that ever happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1004.553s">Oh</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1005.033s">Oh</a>  yeah, frequently, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1006.294s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1007.814s">The</a>  reason we make such a good team is that we have a lot of the same sort of sensibilities.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1011.899s">Yeah,</a>  we're pretty much on the same page.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1013.842s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1014.062s">And</a>  we've worked together for a long time.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1015.023s">We've</a>  worked together for a long time.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1016.345s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1016.746s">I</a>  mean, we've worked together for about a decade, almost a decade.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1018.888s">Sometimes</a>  it's always like, seems like, you know, one person always</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1023.228s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1024.208s">But</a>  this is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1024.968s">So</a>  yeah, no, this is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1026.089s">Three</a>  is always working together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1028.209s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1028.409s">Yeah,</a>  we used to we used to at one point be a foursome. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1031.11s">But</a>  yeah, our other person decided she she just couldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1035.711s">She</a>  couldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1036.811s">It</a>  was a big leap.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1039.072s">It's</a>  a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1040.292s">I</a>  really do understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1041.813s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1042.273s">Well,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1043.313s">people</a>  don't, but I appreciate it and I think the whole city, I really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1049.218s">I</a>  think you're going to be welcomed. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1050.899s">I</a>  think once the word gets out there about what you're doing, how you're doing it, why you're doing it, I really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1057.544s">I</a>  just, oh, I want it to take off because we need a newspaper.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1061.347s">People</a>  have been very welcoming.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1062.888s">They</a>  have been wonderful.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1065.43s">We've</a>  received a lot, like I said, a lot of feedback from people just saying hi. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1069.172s">I</a>  just wanted to say hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1071.493s">Like</a>  I said, they've been welcoming, very much so.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1074.315s">Of</a>  course, we haven't been around long enough to irritate anyone yet either, so there's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1078.157s">We're</a>  ready for that.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1079.418s">No,</a>  I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1079.938s">Well,</a>  that's going to happen too, but you've got to expect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1081.939s">But</a>  we're used to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1082.859s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1084.18s">So,</a>  I mean, measuring success. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1086.361s">I</a>  mean, how do you measure it? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1089.883s">Where</a>  are you now and where do you want to go?</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1092.385s">I</a>  mean, there's the basics of analytics, of just looking at your analytics. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1097.108s">You</a>  can see who's reading what, how long they're staying in a story. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1099.47s">It's</a>  amazing if you pay attention to your analytics, what it can tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1103.593s">So</a>  there's that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1105.054s">Feedback.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1105.554s">Feedback.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1106.155s">And</a>  like you said, so far the feedback has all been good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1109.317s">It's</a>  all been well.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1110.658s">There's</a>  been a lot of word of mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1114.442s">We're</a>  so happy to be on your show. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1116.884s">We've</a>  done a couple of interviews with some local papers, but we haven't really done publicity.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1127.815s">meet</a>  the editor. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1128.495s">Coffee</a>  and donuts kind of thing, but we just haven't done it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1131.996s">We've</a>  been too busy.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1133.457s">One</a>  of the things that we definitely want to do, and I think we're going to be doing this in the fall, because right now since we're coming on summer, not a lot of people around, we're hoping to do a News Deserts workshop at the library with Dan Kennedy and Ellen, what is Ellen's last name? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1152.538s">Ellen</a>  Clegg, yes, they wrote a book about news deserts and the library is, we've been working with them a little bit about doing something and introduce ourselves to more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1161.181s">That</a>  is a beautiful library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1162.282s">Oh,</a>  it really is, yeah.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1164.042s">It's</a>  been word of mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1165.403s">Another</a>  thing people don't know about, it is all word of mouth, but I've been up there quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1169.904s">I</a>  mean, I've done things with other people.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1172.185s">Go</a>  and check out your library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1173.366s">It's</a>  amazing.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1174.086s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1174.426s">People</a>  have to check it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1175.826s">We</a>  did a show on the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1177.547s">Yeah,</a>  we really did. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1178.608s">And</a>  I was like, wow. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1180.449s">And</a>  the staff is so great.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1181.489s">And</a>  they offer so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1182.53s">It's</a>  amazing.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1183.33s">And</a>  people don't realize what they offer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1185.751s">And</a>  it's something for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1188.133s">There</a>  really is today.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1189.814s">And</a>  they've been very supportive of us, too.</p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1191.935s">And</a>  you say it like I do, library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1194.396s">Yes,</a>  library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1196.237s">Some</a>  people think it's library.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1197.398s">Don't</a>  tell me. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1198.298s">No,</a>  it's not library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1199.919s">It</a>  never was. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1200.799s">It's</a>  library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1203.961s">You</a>  know, that's library. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1206.082s">No,</a>  no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1208.883s">All</a>  right, so, you know, the feedback's been good. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1211.144s">I'm</a>  glad to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1213.345s">What</a>  about the difficulties? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1217.446s">I</a>  mean, it's got to be, I mean, you got to have days where it's, you know, what obstacles are you facing? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1223.708s">You</a>  know, what are your biggest obstacles, difficulties?</p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1228.535s">Aside</a>  from sitting in front of the computer for three hours and realizing you don't have a paragraph? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1233.903s">Because</a>  writing is so easy.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1237.027s">It's</a>  difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1239.11s">People</a>  aren't used to having a newspaper in their computer anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1243.536s">We</a>  were just reading, I was just reading an article in Pointner which had this fabulous thing saying, you know, more and more of these independent little newspapers are finding that they're hitting their head against a wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1255.801s">And</a>  it's because so many of those communities, when they lost their papers, they switched, you know, town officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1263.423s">So</a>  town officials aren't used to being accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1265.664s">They're</a>  not used to talking to newspapers. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1266.905s">And</a>  they don't think they have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1267.905s">And</a>  they don't think they have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1268.746s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1269.586s">I</a>  agree.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1270.386s">So</a>  we can just take this as a fair warning. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1273.909s">They</a>  don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1274.63s">I</a>  mean, it would be very nice if they would return phone calls and answer our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1280.839s">And</a>  we're not out to get anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1282.481s">We're</a>  just out to tell a story. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1284.063s">But</a>  the idea that we won't do the story because they won't call us, yeah, that's a myth. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1288.81s">Because</a>  we're going to do the story anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1291.512s">It</a>  would be nicer to do it with, you know, with all the voices that we can get, because that's really, again, that's what we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1298.118s">We</a>  want to be the voice for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1300.62s">We</a>  want the community to have its voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1302.162s">We'll</a>  write the stories anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1304.223s">There's</a>  no urgency to return calls.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1306.806s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1307.807s">I</a>  mean, what's your experience? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1309.868s">City</a>  Hall, you know, the local government, I mean, are they <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1314.586s">To</a>  be diplomatic. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1315.807s">What's</a>  the feeling? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1316.827s">Are</a>  they helping you out? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1318.028s">Are</a>  they welcoming you? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1319.129s">They're</a>  welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1320.249s">They're</a>  very welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1321.61s">I</a>  would think so.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1322.21s">But</a>  they're also very structured in the way that you have to request news. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1327.433s">So</a>  you can't just call up someone that you want to talk to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1331.575s">You</a>  have to go through a certain process. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1336.758s">And</a>  that is very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1338.199s">Because</a>  sometimes you're just asking a very innocuous question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1341.4s">And</a>  you could just literally call up that person. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1343.62s">What</a>  day is the garbage picked up?</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1345.641s">And</a>  it's like, I just need to talk to a guy from DPW.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1348.522s">And</a>  you're running through this maze of just trying to get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1351.703s">And</a>  that's the interesting part. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1353.683s">Because</a>  if we're asking these very simple questions, and they can't answer them without going through a bunch of hoops, how are they going to answer a hard question?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1362.266s">So,</a>  I mean... I mean, I have been told by somebody that I can't answer that because... Yeah, sometimes I think it's because they're afraid to answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1370.053s">I</a>  think they're afraid to say something wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1371.234s">Even</a>  the basic stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1371.875s">And</a>  they've literally been told.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1373.036s">I</a>  think they've literally been told. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1374.317s">Like,</a>  I know that I asked a very simple question of someone recently and he told me, I can't tell you that because I can't, I'm not supposed to be talking to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1382.764s">That's</a>  not a good thing.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1385.465s">That's</a>  not transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1386.846s">For</a>  a community that keeps saying it wants transparency, that's not transparency.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1391.408s">Let's</a>  be honest. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1393.43s">I</a>  can get into a whole bunch of things but I won't.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1397.952s">But</a>  we're hoping that we'll win them over.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1400.213s">It</a>  seems like you're pulling teeth to get information.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1403.375s">And</a>  it shouldn't be that way.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1404.796s">It</a>  should be easy.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1405.796s">But</a>  we're not afraid to go after that information either. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1408.358s">And</a>  that's the thing that I think people, like Chris was saying, I think some people say, well, if I don't give them the information, they're not, that's not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1417.082s">I</a>  don't think you're going anywhere.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1422.805s">Like</a>  you said, there's probably not a situation we haven't come across in our years.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1428.667s">Like</a>  I said, it's like what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1431.468s">All</a>  we're doing is giving you information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1433.289s">We're</a>  giving out facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1434.449s">We're</a>  not out to get you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1436.53s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1436.93s">No</a>  one's out to get anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1439.811s">what</a>  happened, why it happened, how it happened, who did it, who it's impacting, how it's going to hurt you, or help you.</p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1447.298s">And</a>  to be fair, this is something that's happening in communities all across Massachusetts, that governments are becoming less <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1456.247s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1456.587s">You</a>  know, less transparent.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1458.308s">Yeah,</a>  this is totally not. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1459.289s">Very</a>  much so. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1460.169s">I</a>  agree with that.</p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1460.89s">It's</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1461.61s">It's</a>  everybody.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1462.11s">Lonely,</a>  it's a horror show. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1463.871s">We</a>  have a lot of our colleagues that were also let go from the same conglomerate have started up neighboring papers and they're running into the same thing in their communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1472.516s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1473.156s">There's</a>  a very big independent newspaper community out there right now, and it's growing by leaps and bounds.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1479.721s">Yeah,</a>  it needs to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1480.902s">It</a>  really does.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1481.743s">It's</a>  wonderful to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1484.745s">I,</a>  myself, for example, I'm a part-time editor for the Winchester News. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1489.409s">Oh,</a>  I didn't know that.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1490.209s">I</a>  learned something new today.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1491.751s">That's</a>  my other job, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1493.772s">So</a>  what I've seen, and we've been to some different workshops and some different conferences of all these little places, and sometimes it's just people in the community with no journalism experience, and they'll start it up, and then they'll look for somebody like us, journalists, to come and help them be able to pull it all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1513.94s">And</a>  everybody's at different stages. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1515.502s">So</a>  you have people like Brookline, which they've been doing it for a really long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1520.608s">And</a>  you have people with, you know, million dollar resources, who are doing an amazing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1526.415s">But</a>  what I found is everyone has been very supportive and very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1531.28s">So,</a>  you know, people have helped us along the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1534.664s">And</a>  then we, in turn, have had people call us and say, well, how do you do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1539.666s">I'm</a>  looking to start something in my community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1541.547s">How</a>  do you do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1542.928s">And</a>  we'll either give them the information that was sort of helped us, or we basically turn them over to somebody who's a little further ahead of us and who might have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1552.933s">It</a>  has become very, very much so of a supportive little community.</p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1557.195s">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1557.495s">Yeah,</a>  and it's good for us, especially because a number of the people that we used to work with, who we miss, <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1564.118s">I</a>  have now started publication, so we can reconnect.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1570.803s">The</a>  last question I really have, and I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1574.205s">It's</a>  been wonderful talking to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1578.348s">You</a>  know you're coming back, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1579.789s">I</a>  hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1580.63s">We'd</a>  love to. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1584.312s">I</a>  just think it's a great thing what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1587.156s">I</a>  think the city of Medford needs this. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1591.601s">We've</a>  wanted it for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1596.287s">So,</a>  I mean, what are you looking to impact as far as the way this, you know, things in the city, what do you think your impact will be?</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1606.473s">We</a>  wanna bring the community back together and give them a forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1609.755s">And</a>  when I first started at the transcript as its editor, my whole goal was to give the city and everyone in the paper, it's not our paper, it's your voice, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1621.662s">We</a>  wanna give people their voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1624.003s">You</a>  know, as Wendell keeps saying, it's your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1627.186s">We're</a>  just reporting the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1628.827s">This</a>  stuff is happening in your community, right?</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1632.41s">We</a>  don't live here.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1633.271s">It's</a>  your tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1635.973s">You</a>  know, and we're reporting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1637.835s">We're</a>  giving you the information so that, you know, you keep saying, you know, to make the decisions you need to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1644.08s">So</a>  that's the impact that we hope to have.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1645.641s">And</a>  you all know how much is going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1647.102s">We've</a>  had the charter, all the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1650.244s">There's</a>  a lot going on.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1652.145s">We're</a>  trying to wrap our heads around all of it, watching old past meetings and stuff to try to get a handle on what's going on.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1658.71s">I</a>  think everyone wants similar things, but they're so far apart in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1667.835s">You</a>  want to see improvements, but you want to see them in a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1673.399s">There's</a>  got to be some balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1674.66s">There's</a>  no balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1675.501s">Yeah,</a>  there has to be.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1677.202s">I</a>  think the other impact, I mean, I'd like to see is, you know, I want people to think of us, you know, something happens, like Nell said, you've got something good in your life happens, something bad in your life happens, you want to know what's going on next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1687.991s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1688.792s">Call</a>  us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1689.732s">Tell</a>  us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1690.513s">Tell</a>  us about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1691.233s">Bring</a>  us a picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1692.514s">You</a>  know, ask us a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1694.194s">Just</a>  give us an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1695.215s">Give</a>  us your story ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1696.755s">Gottaknowmedford.com</a>  is our website, and gottaknowmedford at gmail.com is how you can reach us. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1704.319s">So</a>  please, reach out.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1743.702s">So</a>  it's been a good response. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1745.284s">I</a>  mean, when we've called people, I'm like, I'm from Ghana, no Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1747.686s">And</a>  they'll be like, what's that? <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1748.947s">And</a>  I'll say the new paper, the new paper.</p>

    <p>[Nell Escobar Coakley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1754.452s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1754.672s">Yes,</a>  they've been very, very appreciative. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1757.114s">And</a>  you know, it makes you it makes you sort of feel like you're on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1761.118s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I think you so.</p>

    <p>[Chris Stevens]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1818.513s">We</a>  were just like, I was in my car driving somewhere and she called me and she's like,</p>

    <p>[Wendall Waters]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1823.595s">I</a>  was in Florida visiting my parents.</p>

    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1835.4s">No,</a>  but it's a good story. <a href="https://youtu.be/nRpogo_iMto&t=1836.98s">It's</a>  a great start.</p>
