1
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:05,551
All right, everyone.

2
00:00:05,571 --> 00:00:09,653
We are live on YouTube for anyone who wants to view this at a later date.

3
00:00:10,394 --> 00:00:15,796
We're also recording locally if we need to share out the presentation.

4
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:18,177
I do want to thank everyone for being here.

5
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:22,960
We were trying something new this year by offering it during the day in the hopes that parents might be able to

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:33,704
step away during the lunch break, take a few minutes to listen in, and to be part of the conversation on this topic and the presentation that will be going for fifth grade students.

7
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:43,508
We just want to let you know, last year I think we had three parents on when we offered in the evening, and I'm very excited that we have so many other parents joining us today.

8
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:48,490
And at this time, I'm going to turn it over to Rachel Perry.

9
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,712
And if anyone needs to change their name, you just click up in your image.

10
00:00:53,913 --> 00:00:55,233
There are three little dots.

11
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,054
And if you click that, it'll say rename.

12
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:02,156
I appreciate our nursing staff being here as well.

13
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,197
They're such an integral part to everything that we do.

14
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:12,281
And I do want to now move forward with Rachel Perry taking the lead from here.

15
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,102
Good afternoon, everybody, welcome.

16
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:25,205
So I'm gonna give you a little bit of background, my background, what we've been doing, and then really dive into the few lessons and talk about some objectives and how this curriculum works.

17
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:29,007
And then I will leave some time at the end for any questions you might have.

18
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:35,089
So I've been the director of physical education and health education for the past nine years here in Medford.

19
00:01:36,969 --> 00:01:41,311
We have recently evaluated, sorry,

20
00:01:41,806 --> 00:01:46,149
We have recently evaluated our health curriculum.

21
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:49,831
We had a HECAT committee evaluate everything we're doing.

22
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:55,114
We've been using the Michigan model for middle school and high school.

23
00:01:55,834 --> 00:02:10,103
And based on that HECAT evaluation, they didn't think that what we were doing for puberty and sexual education at the higher grades was appropriately meeting the needs of our students so that we needed to make an update.

24
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:25,114
What we've been using for puberty in the past is just a video was a Procter and Gamble puberty video and that was presented by our nurses, as that served our students well for the time, it's time to really move on so that we can make sure that we're servicing everybody.

25
00:02:26,952 --> 00:02:32,976
So based on that HECAT work, the recommendation was to look for a new puberty curriculum.

26
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,538
And Puberty Happens is the curriculum that we chose.

27
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,841
That was actually a referral from one of my colleagues over in Reading.

28
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:51,148
And what we've done is, it's a lot of lessons, but we've kind of pared it down to about three lessons that we will be able to teach to our fifth graders, where before it was only one lesson.

29
00:02:53,766 --> 00:03:04,335
The Puberty Happens curriculum is gonna be presented in our Nexus classes, and that is gonna be by our Nexus teachers and nurses who will be supporting the teachers with this curriculum.

30
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:12,863
The Nexus teachers did attend a puberty training, a one-day puberty training, so they have all been trained in how to teach puberty.

31
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:22,445
So what I'm going to do is I'm kind of going to go through the lessons and talk about the objectives in what kind of activities they're doing.

32
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:26,250
And then, like I said, I will open it up for you for all your questions after.

33
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:29,675
So the first lesson is really

34
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:41,246
It's getting started with a warm up activity it's kind of an icebreaker, and it sets the stage to help students feel more comfortable with each other before launching into the curriculum content.

35
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:49,515
Students may have different expectations about what will be discussed in puberty class in the warm up is an opportunity.

36
00:03:50,496 --> 00:04:01,206
to promote the concept that it's normal for students to have both similarities and differences, and that each person develops in different ways, at a different pace, and in a different time frame.

37
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:06,751
So that first warm-up activity is actually called, do you, have you, or are you?

38
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:15,619
And teachers designate areas of the room where students gather if they agree with the statement or they don't identify with the statement.

39
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:19,741
Some of the statements could be, do you like to sleep late on weekends?

40
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:21,322
You know, things like that.

41
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:22,963
Do you have more than one pet?

42
00:04:23,364 --> 00:04:24,845
Do you hope to be famous one day?

43
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:27,846
So, you know, a lot of different questions.

44
00:04:28,447 --> 00:04:33,210
And when finished, and we have the students sit down,

45
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:36,426
And what we do is we'll ask them some questions.

46
00:04:36,726 --> 00:04:39,208
How did it feel when you were in a group with a number of your friends?

47
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:43,010
What was it like when you were by yourself or just with a few others?

48
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:50,575
And that we want students to understand that sometimes when you're going through puberty, you may feel left out.

49
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:54,898
It's important to remember that everyone goes through the change of puberty at different times.

50
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:59,421
We should avoid situations where we cause someone to feel hurt, left out or alone.

51
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:03,884
And we need to be understanding of other people's feelings and value our differences.

52
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:10,210
So that's our first warmup activity, and that's in that first lesson.

53
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:15,154
Then we move on to what we call setting classroom agreements.

54
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:23,201
We want to make sure that we establish a set of behavioral expectations or classroom rules when we're presenting this unit.

55
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,505
And some of those are, you know, respecting others.

56
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,807
The questions are welcome.

57
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:42,777
that you have the right to pass if you're uncomfortable with an activity or a question, that we're not going to gossip or talk about anyone in class or how they've responded to anything.

58
00:05:43,798 --> 00:05:44,559
So things like that.

59
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:49,584
So we're setting that community expectation of respect and acceptance throughout the class.

60
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:57,753
The last piece of that first lesson is we're going to introduce what we call the anonymous question box.

61
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:12,456
So each teacher has an anonymous question box on their desk, and they're going to give students an opportunity at the end of lessons to ask a question that they might not want to ask out loud, that they might not feel comfortable asking out loud.

62
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:18,958
And teachers will review those in address in the next lesson.

63
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:22,227
And that's the first lesson.

64
00:06:23,288 --> 00:06:28,493
Moving from there, what we have is what we call the puberty changes match up.

65
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:37,182
So in this lesson, we're looking at physical, emotional and social changes that our students might be going through during puberty.

66
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:45,176
Students are put into small groups, and they passed out some cards with physical, emotional, and social changes on them.

67
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:49,918
And students are asked to put these changes into a grouping.

68
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,239
Is it physical, is it emotional, or is it social?

69
00:06:53,499 --> 00:07:01,082
And teachers will be able to walk around, have some conversations with students, and then they will review those at the end.

70
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:04,563
The second piece to this lesson,

71
00:07:06,804 --> 00:07:19,424
is the Dear Puberty activity, where students are going to be given some scenarios that they need to discuss in a group, and how they would deal with those scenarios, and then the teacher would address it at the end.

72
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:29,255
And the last part to that lesson is a supplemental home activity, which we are choosing to use.

73
00:07:29,295 --> 00:07:30,416
It's called the interview.

74
00:07:31,156 --> 00:07:38,341
And this is set up so that our students come home to our parents and caregivers and are able to have some conversation with them.

75
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:49,109
And some of those questions they're gonna ask on that assignment is what was popular in clothing and music when you were my age?

76
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:53,790
What did you like most when you were my age?

77
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,771
What did you like least?

78
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,792
How old were you when you started going through puberty?

79
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:02,432
Who was your best friend and what did you like about them?

80
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:07,113
What do you want me to know about growing up?

81
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:12,714
And who was someone you could talk to when you had a problem or concern?

82
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:20,076
So that's the assignment that students will take home to start those conversation with parents and caregivers.

83
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:28,562
Um, the last lesson, uh, will encompass some hygiene and taking care of my body.

84
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:37,587
And that is going to, um, go over some anatomy of the, um,

85
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:43,209
sexual organs, penis and vagina.

86
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:47,830
And then they will be going into how do I take care of my body?

87
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,671
How do I deal with hygiene?

88
00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:54,712
What do we use when we are having our menstrual cycle?

89
00:08:55,573 --> 00:08:58,894
How do we deal with pubic hair and things like that?

90
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:03,395
So those will all be addressed in that lesson.

91
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:09,137
And that lesson may take one to two classes.

92
00:09:10,153 --> 00:09:14,016
It might not be, you know, all done in one lesson.

93
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:22,941
I will say there are a lot more lessons within this curriculum that we will not be covering in the fifth grade.

94
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:32,046
We just don't have the time, one, and those are maybe some things that we could push over to the middle school level.

95
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,503
So that's what we have kind of in a nutshell.

96
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:44,568
So I will be open now to take any questions that you might have.

97
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:56,598
Jessica Healy.

98
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:06,030
Hi, how are you?

99
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,350
Good, how are you?

100
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:10,152
Good, I just have a question.

101
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:21,478
Are we gonna, well, are the teachers going to be discussing like sexual orientation, gender identity?

102
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:30,803
So we will be using inclusive language, but we will be really going over what's happening in the body during puberty.

103
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,885
Okay, so we're geared towards

104
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,564
The changes of the body, not so much.

105
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:39,324
Yes, not in the fifth grade.

106
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:40,405
We won't be going into that.

107
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:41,865
It would just be the changes in the body.

108
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,925
OK, thank you for that.

109
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:44,886
You're welcome.

110
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,287
Christine Haverty.

111
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:56,549
Hi.

112
00:10:58,713 --> 00:10:59,913
Thank you for doing this.

113
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:04,995
We have our first child going through this, so all the guidance is helpful.

114
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:11,536
So when is this going to start, just so we have time to chat with our son about it?

115
00:11:12,477 --> 00:11:12,917
Next week.

116
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:15,057
So the 13th is the first, yes.

117
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:25,723
just sorry, but we, so basically it's changes in the body and then nothing like really beyond that.

118
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:30,907
I'm just trying to figure out when my husband and stuff talks with our son, what we should be talking about.

119
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:31,928
Correct.

120
00:11:31,968 --> 00:11:33,649
So we're talking about changes in the body.

121
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:39,093
We will be talking a little bit about anatomy, nothing further than that until sixth grade.

122
00:11:39,393 --> 00:11:39,673
Okay.

123
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:42,875
Well, hopefully you guys will get across that deodorant is good.

124
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:43,316
Yes.

125
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:44,617
That's part of it.

126
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:45,457
We're trying.

127
00:11:47,526 --> 00:11:52,328
Okay, Christine, as a as a former middle school principal high school teacher assistant principal.

128
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:57,370
I've had a lot of those conversations over the years or any home conversations would be great as well.

129
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,590
Yes, of course.

130
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,411
Thank you.

131
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:03,532
Thank you.

132
00:12:04,173 --> 00:12:05,253
I'm Carrie Casey.

133
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:08,077
Hi, good afternoon.

134
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:18,189
So, two questions for lesson two, you, you talked about the small groups and the cards for identifying physical, emotional and social changes.

135
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:22,394
You said that was a puberty activity, but you didn't provide any.

136
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:24,716
Details on that.

137
00:12:24,736 --> 00:12:39,191
So I'm just curious what that activity looks like small groups class activity and then for lesson three is just, is this the teacher just talking to them about anatomy hygiene menstrual cycle or is there.

138
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,321
No, they're actually going to be like, how is this going to be presented?

139
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:45,922
Sure.

140
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:51,803
So that piece, they're going to be given pictures of different things that we might use during puberty and talk about how they can be used.

141
00:12:51,843 --> 00:12:57,705
And then the teacher will review it after, if that makes sense.

142
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:03,127
I'm just trying to pull up some of those scenarios from the Dear Puberty activity for you.

143
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:12,317
I hope, did that answer your question for that?

144
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:17,021
For the taking care of my body or no?

145
00:13:17,702 --> 00:13:18,442
No, I'm sorry.

146
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,664
Could you expand on that?

147
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:22,186
Sure.

148
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,311
So I'm going to see if I can show.

149
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:30,492
So I don't know if you can see this at all.

150
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:37,654
These pictures will be given out to students and they'll talk about how these can be used during or should be used during puberty.

151
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:41,455
A soap, how should we be, you know, we should be showering every day.

152
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:45,016
We have a pad and tampons showing things for

153
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:48,550
females when they get their menstrual cycle.

154
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:54,593
We talk about, you know, shaving and taking care of our bodies that way.

155
00:13:54,813 --> 00:14:06,278
We also do gonna be talking about SPF and making sure that our, that we're, you know, safe using, you know, in the sun, using products in the sun.

156
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,859
So does that help?

157
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,820
So that's lesson three?

158
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:14,362
Yes, that is lesson three and talking about taking care of our bodies.

159
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:21,558
And then I'm just looking for, I didn't expect you to ask about scenarios, I'm just gonna try to pull them.

160
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:33,240
And while you're speaking about that, just so everybody's aware, we are actually today and the remainder of this week installing, they're called EGAL, Feminine Product Dispensers.

161
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:44,542
Throughout our middle schools and high schools, they're essentially feminine products on a roll that will be in one stall of the fourth, fifth,

162
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:53,025
middle and high school bathrooms, but just so that everybody's aware that we're taking it beyond the nurse's office at this point.

163
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:56,065
Thank you, Peter.

164
00:14:56,566 --> 00:15:03,748
All right, so there's a lot of different scenarios that students will be reviewing, and then they'll talk about how they might deal with it.

165
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:07,169
For example, I am one of the shortest kids in my class.

166
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:10,030
When I was younger, I did a school science project on shrimp,

167
00:15:10,771 --> 00:15:13,714
Some kids in my class gave me the nickname shrimpy and it stuck.

168
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:17,117
Now where the kids are using the name and it really makes me mad.

169
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:21,602
Why am I so short and how can I get them to stop calling me shrimpy?

170
00:15:22,262 --> 00:15:29,529
So students would read that scenario, talk about what advice they have and who might this person go to for help.

171
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,791
So that's one example.

172
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:35,315
Let's see if I can give you another one.

173
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:39,583
I was given a presentation at school and my voice started to crack and squeak.

174
00:15:39,703 --> 00:15:42,023
Now I'm embarrassed to talk out loud in class again.

175
00:15:42,684 --> 00:15:45,744
What advice do you have and who might this person go to for help?

176
00:15:48,205 --> 00:15:55,466
So there's a lot of different scenarios that will be presented to students in groups and they'll come up with ideas on how they can deal with those scenarios.

177
00:15:56,867 --> 00:15:59,147
And that was from the Dear Puberty activity.

178
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:01,988
Great, thank you.

179
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:03,068
You're welcome.

180
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:13,611
Jessica Haley, I think we're next.

181
00:16:13,631 --> 00:16:15,171
Hi, sorry, I just have one more question.

182
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:22,013
My son is in a inclusion classes on IEP.

183
00:16:22,874 --> 00:16:28,215
Is there going to be someone there that's able to help him like navigate the reading the writing?

184
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:39,725
I would have to check with the teacher and the principal, but we can absolutely follow up on that.

185
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:41,046
Okay.

186
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:42,747
What school is he at?

187
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:43,407
Brooks School.

188
00:16:43,808 --> 00:16:45,229
The Brooks, okay.

189
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,292
I'm just making a note.

190
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:56,898
So does he usually have support in the Nexus classroom?

191
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:58,259
I'm not sure.

192
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:01,690
his para might go there with them.

193
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,953
I'm just not 100% positive if they do.

194
00:17:06,314 --> 00:17:12,179
We can meet, you know, I can talk to the principal and teacher and make sure if you feel he needs that support that we have that there for him.

195
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:15,341
Okay, yeah, because he's just he's a non reader and stuff.

196
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:24,669
So he'd be a little, you know, in a group of just kids, he'd be a little intimidated with not being able to maybe completely understand what's being said.

197
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:25,610
Correct.

198
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:25,870
Okay.

199
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,471
Yeah, I can drop you an email.

200
00:17:28,511 --> 00:17:34,233
I'm sure I can find your email in School Brains and I will reach out to the principal and teacher and get back to you on that.

201
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:35,294
Perfect.

202
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:35,614
Thank you.

203
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:36,254
I appreciate it.

204
00:17:36,594 --> 00:17:37,094
You're welcome.

205
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:40,536
Tracy Wagner.

206
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:49,839
I saying thank you for doing this.

207
00:17:49,979 --> 00:17:52,981
I'm involved in the curriculum review and in other school districts.

208
00:17:53,081 --> 00:17:57,565
I'm thrilled that Medford is following the new comprehensive health standards.

209
00:17:57,605 --> 00:17:58,706
That's fantastic.

210
00:17:59,407 --> 00:17:59,947
Hi, Peter.

211
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:03,250
And a couple comments.

212
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,094
One is totally hearing that this is not about gender or sexual orientation and

213
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:25,231
noting that many families like ours are two parents, my son has two moms, and so just making sure language is gender and sexual orientation family-wise inclusive is really appreciated.

214
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:32,598
I know there's a number of non-binary students in my son's class, so language around that, while that's not what is being taught,

215
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:37,280
in talking to the children about their families and their own identity is really appreciated.

216
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,902
And also just noting I'm already starting to get teary-eyed when I think about those interviews.

217
00:18:43,982 --> 00:18:49,924
Those questions are super powerful and poignant, and I think that's really nice you're doing the home connection there.

218
00:18:49,984 --> 00:18:50,504
So thank you.

219
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:52,025
You're welcome.

220
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:52,405
Thank you.

221
00:18:54,586 --> 00:19:02,275
Also, and I can't remember if Rachel mentioned this, but this is now our second year in a row of combining the genders.

222
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:04,958
Previously, Medford separated boys and girls.

223
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:13,167
And so one of our ways of trying to be more inclusive is not by creating that level of stigma, by separating out the genders.

224
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:14,769
Everyone will be together.

225
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:25,960
And what our nurses like to offer anything to the conversation at this time.

226
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:36,793
We have great nurses in our district and just, you know, checking in to make sure that if you have anything to add, feel free.

227
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:51,538
I don't, I'll just speak.

228
00:19:51,818 --> 00:20:05,022
I don't have anything in particular to say, but just to reiterate that the nurses are also there with the Nexus teachers to support the education.

229
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:09,063
Appreciate that.

230
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:10,524
Thank you so much for that.

231
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:10,944
Yes.

232
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:21,848
All right, if there are any other questions, feel free to raise your hand.

233
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:27,653
You can also email Rachel at rperry at medford.k12.ma.us.

234
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:34,418
She'll then be able to send our, excuse me, she'll then be able to send any questions to the nurses if you need.

235
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:38,301
You can also email me anytime you want at pcushing at medford.k12.ma.us.

236
00:20:41,964 --> 00:20:46,106
And if there are no further questions at this time, then I want to wish everybody a great day.

237
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:50,609
I am really excited that by offering this, it seems that we've gotten a lot more parents.

238
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:57,393
So perhaps we'll offer it during the day and then an evening at some other point for other things moving forward.

239
00:20:57,713 --> 00:20:59,394
But I do want to thank everyone for being here.

240
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:08,359
And also, if you want to have a one on one meeting with me to kind of have, you know, talk about this or look at the actual lessons,

241
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:11,013
I can make those appointments as well.

242
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:12,494
Email me and we'll set something up.

243
00:21:13,594 --> 00:21:16,637
And I just want to add, this is one of the nurses.

244
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:32,248
If your child feels uncomfortable talking to you and feels more comfortable talking to either the nexus teacher or the nurses, sometimes the kids will come down after class and talk to the nurses and ask those questions.

245
00:21:32,368 --> 00:21:35,671
So that is still an opportunity, even though

246
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:46,026
Um, at the mess attack, we won't be in the classroom, but, um, if they need anything, then, um, they certainly can, uh, stop down.

247
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:53,853
All right.

248
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,054
Thank you, everybody.

249
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:56,595
I really appreciate it.

250
00:21:57,135 --> 00:21:57,696
And as
