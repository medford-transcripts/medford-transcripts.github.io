1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:00,892
So good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:00,932 --> 00:00:06,095
Welcome to the City Metro Conservation Commission meeting for July 23rd.

3
00:00:12,258 --> 00:00:17,922
First item on the agenda is a continuation of the notice of intent for 99 Rivera Beach Parkway, DEP file number 215-0242.

4
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:27,315
CPC Land Acquisition Company LLP has filed a notice of intent for proposed redevelopment of 97-99 Revere Beach Parkway.

5
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:40,946
The redevelopment proposal includes the demolition of an existing radio station building, parking lots, and associated structures, and construction of a new 352,400 gross square foot transit-oriented multifamily residential building with ground floor retail and structured parking.

6
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:48,095
Additional site improvements include a new stormwater management system, waterfront public access walkways, and wildlife habitat enhancements.

7
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:55,940
A portion of the property is within a 200-foot riverfront area, being the Malden River, and then 100-foot buffer zone to top of bank and bordering a vegetated well.

8
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:02,665
Thank you, Dennis, and welcome, everybody, for the continuation of this hearing.

9
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:08,489
I understand that the proponent has submitted... Recording in progress.

10
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:10,390
...supplemental information.

11
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:16,588
and we'd appreciate if you could walk us through the benefit of all the commission members here.

12
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:18,308
Sure.

13
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:19,329
Happy to do that.

14
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:21,109
I'm going to share my screen.

15
00:01:21,169 --> 00:01:22,990
I put together a short presentation.

16
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,271
Let's see.

17
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:39,696
Can everybody see that?

18
00:01:41,617 --> 00:01:43,557
Yes.

19
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:44,678
Thank you for having us.

20
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:46,758
My name is Natty King.

21
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,259
I'm a consultant for CPC Land Acquisition Company.

22
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:55,820
We're here to discuss the 97 and 99 Revere Beach Parkway project.

23
00:01:56,661 --> 00:02:02,582
Also with me today is Jack Englert and Eric Van Aram from the applicant

24
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:04,195
J.P.

25
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:13,058
Shadley from Shadley Associates, the landscape architect, Nate Shiel from Tetra Tech, the civil engineer, and Valerie Moore from Nutter.

26
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:16,959
So I'll keep this brief.

27
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,802
I'm going to just summarize the supplemental materials that we submitted to you a few days ago, and then I'll pass it over to J.P.

28
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:30,684
Shadley for a brief discussion on the context of the proposed walkway and landscaping.

29
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:39,714
So on the screen here, the image you see is our updated site plan submitted to you a couple of days ago.

30
00:02:40,714 --> 00:02:52,977
Dennis ran through the spiel about the project components, but for everyone's benefit, I'll just quickly say the project consists of a six story, 350,000 gross square foot residential building.

31
00:02:53,477 --> 00:03:01,019
We're proposing new publicly accessible shoreline walkways to help complete a link in the regional greenway network

32
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:13,192
We're proposing native landscaping, including significant wildlife habitat as mitigation, as well as removal of litter and invasives from the site's Malden River shoreline.

33
00:03:13,672 --> 00:03:19,479
And then last but not least, we're proposing a new stormwater management system with infiltration provisions.

34
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:26,875
So we appreciate all the feedback we got at the last hearing.

35
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,839
We grouped it, our updates based on that feedback into a few broad buckets.

36
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,560
The first of which is stormwater.

37
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:50,710
So at your request, we updated the plans to show snow storage areas, denote that existing catch basins will be protected during the construction period and show the inspection ports for the infiltration and detention system.

38
00:03:52,048 --> 00:03:55,151
We've also clarified our stormwater pretreatment measures.

39
00:03:56,012 --> 00:04:17,091
This consists of best management practices, including street sweeping, deep-sump hooded catch basins, water quality units, and infiltration basins that result in a total cumulative, total suspended solids removal rate of about 93%, well above the 80% required under the stormwater standards.

40
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:25,606
We've also summarized previous soil and groundwater investigations that were the basis of the stormwater design.

41
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:37,250
And we've increased soil cover above the southern infiltration basin in order to accommodate the planting of native vegetation, including several small trees in that area.

42
00:04:40,377 --> 00:04:44,778
Most of our updates fall within the walkways and landscaping categories.

43
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:52,400
We heard from you at the last hearing concerns about impervious walkway surfaces.

44
00:04:52,681 --> 00:05:04,464
So to that end, we've eliminated one of the walkways that was proposed south of the building, resulting in an 1100 square foot reduction in impervious surfaces.

45
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:21,827
and we've converted the remaining walkways to porous pavement, which results in a further 12,000 square foot reduction in impervious surfaces, all but eliminating walkway associated impervious within the riverfront area.

46
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:32,069
We've also significantly expanded our wildlife and pollinator habitat mitigation areas to both east and west of the shoreline walkway.

47
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:42,817
This includes areas that were previously proposed to be lawn, as well as the BVW areas along the project site shoreline.

48
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:51,651
We've provided a planting schedule outlining the native trees and ground cover that will be used in those mitigation areas.

49
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:57,738
And we've summarized the existing trees along the site's shoreline and how they'll be impacted by the work.

50
00:06:00,349 --> 00:06:04,632
The last major category of updates was the invasive species management plan.

51
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:20,145
Based on your feedback, we clarified our intention of three years of annual monitoring of the shoreline area with further targeted removal of invasives conducted on an as needed basis over that timeframe.

52
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:42,450
and we've updated our control methods for Tree of Heaven, Japanese knotweed, and Phragmites, including the hack and spray method requested at the last hearing for Tree of Heaven, and addressing the Phragmites within the BBW areas that wasn't proposed in our initial NOI submission.

53
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:53,330
And then lastly, we added black swallow wart to the plan in case that species is encountered and needs to be addressed while the proposed work is being undertaken.

54
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,562
So to summarize our updates, appreciated all the feedback.

55
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:15,087
The changes incorporated as a result have led to a decrease in permanent riverfront area impacts, a near total elimination of impervious surfaces associated with the shoreline walkways.

56
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:27,362
in a significant expansion of mitigation, including nearly a tripling of wildlife and pollinator habitat area and a near doubling of the total mitigation program.

57
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:46,677
So overall, we're confident that this project represents a significant improvement over the existing conditions and will create significant benefits related to habitat, stormwater, and public access on this site, both for Medford residents and the local environment.

58
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:50,674
And with that, I'll turn it over to J.P.

59
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:51,254
Shadley.

60
00:07:51,294 --> 00:07:57,858
He has a few words he wants to say specifically about the walkways and the landscaping.

61
00:07:57,938 --> 00:07:59,338
So, J.P., over to you.

62
00:07:59,398 --> 00:07:59,959
Take it away.

63
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:04,821
Mattie, you've got to disable the mail set.

64
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:07,222
Yeah, it says you've disabled screen sharing.

65
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:10,804
I think Dennis might need to grant that permission.

66
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,424
Okay.

67
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:16,667
Thank you.

68
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:37,941
So here we go.

69
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:38,382
Thank you.

70
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:42,365
Go to the first slide.

71
00:08:43,668 --> 00:08:56,119
The project is a link within the Wellington Greenway system, and so it's under the design jurisdiction for the DCR and the site shown here in green and the future.

72
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:14,018
red link here by the MBTA station are the last two links that need to be constructed in the center of otherwise connected and constructed over five miles of existing continuous trails.

73
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,381
The DCR, these three images here, our site is right here.

74
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:27,264
These three images are taken from recent parks that we did with the DCR.

75
00:09:27,544 --> 00:09:45,630
And so they require a 10-foot wide path, continuous throughout the Greenway, and for fire and police and maintenance crews access, and to provide a continuity for the users along the Greenway.

76
00:09:46,476 --> 00:09:59,104
And in addition to that, they often employ swaths of lawn that enable a little bit more increased public safety that uses peace of mind in the secluded areas of the projects that we do for them.

77
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:05,588
And they also allow us the ability to do a variety of different landscape types in our designs.

78
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:26,134
So the inventory of the existing trees that you asked us to do, what we did was we took our plan, we took the, the, uh, inventory that we had had of it and laid it on the new site plan, which you can see the outlines as, as the, uh, park design has evolved just a little bit for grading purposes.

79
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:30,137
I started on the South end of the site and took,

80
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:37,662
Copious notes, it was a lousy day, and any one of you who would like to join me out there sometime to confirm what I found, you're more than welcome to.

81
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:38,763
It was awful.

82
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:43,487
Mulberry and cherry on either side of the Atlantis.

83
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,430
Really, it's pretty nasty, you guys.

84
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:54,277
There's just a lot of vine, grapes, bittersweet, deadly night shade.

85
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:03,128
And, unfortunately, you know, and Mulberry's borderline, it's invasive anyway, but there's not much out there.

86
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:04,590
But there's a couple things.

87
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,075
One is there is, on the south end of the site, a beautiful pin oak.

88
00:11:09,656 --> 00:11:11,839
And we'll obviously save that.

89
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:13,760
It's up above the wall.

90
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,203
The grades here are about 15 feet higher between this tree and where we'll be here.

91
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:29,268
So that, I'll talk a little bit more about that wall later, but we did check as we were asked to confirm that, and we are going to need that wall.

92
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:37,452
But also, I found a beautiful, beyond what we had previously said was our limited work line, I found a beautiful birch grove.

93
00:11:37,972 --> 00:12:07,362
they're just really sweet and so located those on site and they're outside of our grading work so we can recommend that those are saved and if we end up doing the work we will save them and I also found and I think you saw in my notes that man there's an amazing black locust grove and relative to how few trees there are out here this would be pretty darn easy to get the vines out of and maintain the form and so there's a lot of good things about

94
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:08,803
black locusts.

95
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:14,086
I know that they're invasive, but they're native and they're moving north fast with global warming.

96
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:19,608
So I spent some time making notes and we look to you to let us know.

97
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:22,629
Subject to your approval, we'd like to keep them.

98
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:24,610
If you don't want us to, we'll take them out.

99
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:34,774
And either way, we could contain them over time with the methods that we've described in the Invasive Species Management Plan.

100
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:39,641
So it wouldn't be a case of allowing them to just take over the new work.

101
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,602
So that's a question for you.

102
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:46,266
On the north end of the site, it was fairly similar.

103
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:50,969
The mulberry and the apple, here's a picture of one of the apples.

104
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,209
This is the bottom of the tree.

105
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:55,810
I bent over to get a look at it.

106
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,590
And this is the top of the tree.

107
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,351
I just stood up.

108
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:02,392
And this is how bad the grape was just engulfing the tree.

109
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:05,912
So there's not that much, unfortunately, that isn't invasive out there.

110
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:12,874
But there is one beautiful native cherry that I found and that we would want to keep.

111
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:14,254
We'd recommend saving that.

112
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:17,655
So in our plan, our new plan,

113
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:25,117
These trees that have this darker clouded graphic are the ones that we would absolutely recommend and save.

114
00:13:25,737 --> 00:13:29,338
Then the black locust is this lighter color here.

115
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:34,759
That's where we are with the tree inventory and observations about it.

116
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:40,780
I'd like to give you just a couple more project design elements quickly.

117
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,482
The project, it's a link between the Greenway,

118
00:13:48,397 --> 00:13:49,218
Wait a minute, I'm sorry.

119
00:13:49,238 --> 00:13:51,139
I'm going to grab my notes here.

120
00:13:52,960 --> 00:14:03,989
It's going to be a gateway between the paths to the north and the south and east and west.

121
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:11,094
And it's also going to be a place where the 700 people who live in the new home use it as their front yard.

122
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:16,452
Let me go back to this.

123
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:18,234
I want to describe the plan a little bit more.

124
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:31,626
So, the native trees that we're proposing planting will contribute quite a bit to habitat and they're chosen for artistic composition and things like

125
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:35,727
fall color and flowers and beautiful bark and form and different scales.

126
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:40,549
But this is the stone wall that we talked about, and a new stone wall.

127
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,490
There's a lot of stone walls on the Greenway.

128
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:55,357
And so by doing what we've got here, we're creating a new central space where these trees, the new habitat plantings, and the walls

129
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:03,173
form of a framed space that the public has more direct access to than the secondary path.

130
00:15:03,573 --> 00:15:11,876
And so it becomes a formal space that you can sit at, lean on the wall, hang out, and get incredible views out to the river.

131
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:19,919
And again, the proximity, there's the stairway down from the building, the wall wrapping around.

132
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:21,915
And the main path is shown here.

133
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:26,827
This is an older rendering, so this is showing lawn, but we've changed it since then.

134
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:36,918
I also did a couple of cross sections I thought would be very helpful to get at the issue of providing a comfortable path adjacent to the building.

135
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:43,422
And when you see the scale of the building and actual size, the path is about 70 feet.

136
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:47,104
The DCR path, the public path is about 70 feet from the building.

137
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:53,688
There's about eight feet of grade change at this point, which is for section B here.

138
00:15:54,328 --> 00:16:09,072
Then for section C, I blew it up a little bit more so you could get a sense of how it's really pretty close and I think would be more comfortable for everybody involved if there was delineation of the various spaces.

139
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:12,093
That's the end of the presentation.

140
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,553
Welcome to questions.

141
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:14,414
Thanks.

142
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:22,596
Thank you for that, for walking us through that.

143
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:30,345
I open this up to discussion by the commission.

144
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:35,410
I have a question if I may.

145
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:36,372
Of course.

146
00:16:37,993 --> 00:16:44,819
One of the applicants represented speak a little bit to the construction sequence.

147
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:53,906
I don't think I fully realized that it sounds like these are going to be two different projects headed by two different contractors, maybe.

148
00:16:54,707 --> 00:17:01,032
That red spot dotted line of the limit of work, I think was new or I missed it last time.

149
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:07,017
So if someone could just speak to the construction sequence and your coordination with DCR, that'd be great.

150
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:19,519
So, we've been speaking with the DCR about their path for quite a while.

151
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:26,844
We wanted to permit this as 1 project, because we don't know what's going to happen with their funding.

152
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:28,005
We don't know whether or not.

153
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:31,567
you know, the earmarked dollars are still going to be available.

154
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:36,731
So we wanted to be in a position to do all the work on this project.

155
00:17:36,811 --> 00:17:47,179
So there's still discussions to be had with DCR, but the intention is we don't want to just improve the left side of the red line and then have what's happening out there exist.

156
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:54,745
If they're not in a position to do it concurrently or in sequence with us, we would step in and go ahead and complete the path.

157
00:17:58,128 --> 00:18:08,775
Thank you.

158
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:09,615
Okay.

159
00:18:10,096 --> 00:18:20,963
I just want to say in general, and I hope I speak for the commission, but we appreciate the responsiveness to our several, many comments from two weeks ago.

160
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:27,687
And I'm sorry, who did I interrupt?

161
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:34,510
I have some comments and questions on the landscape plans, if I may.

162
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:40,809
I agree with what you just shared, Heidi.

163
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:46,010
I very much appreciate the changes to the plans, and I find them to be a welcome improvement.

164
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,491
There were just a couple things that jumped out to me.

165
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:55,333
For the wall on the south, I understand that there's a retained condition there.

166
00:18:55,353 --> 00:19:01,895
I think my concern even more so than the wall is where the path is shown relative to the shoreline.

167
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:02,595
If I look at the

168
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:11,678
The majority of the site in the plan that's here, there's a significant distance between the mapped shoreline and the DCR path.

169
00:19:12,538 --> 00:19:18,760
Down at that south end of it, it gets half or even a third of the distance from the shoreline.

170
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:35,980
And I don't think it's necessarily something that needs to be resolved, but seeing a little bit more context on that bottom end of the pathway, understanding how this ties into a future alignment there, and understanding the relationship to the shoreline a little better.

171
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:39,964
and the grade there I think would be beneficial.

172
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:42,565
So that's one thought.

173
00:19:43,286 --> 00:19:52,933
The other is that I very much appreciate the mapping of the existing trees and I support the proposal to

174
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:58,958
maintain the black locust and the birch and the cherry and the pin oak.

175
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,279
I think those are all good steps.

176
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:08,326
What stands out to me though, well I should say you also answered our question about what happens between the pathway and that

177
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:15,715
setback line, where in the previous plan there was not proposed landscaping.

178
00:20:16,196 --> 00:20:21,619
But what seems to be missing there are proposed trees in the zone between the path and the shoreline.

179
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:32,866
And there are plenty of great trees to the west of the path, but no new proposed trees in the places where there's active grading work and replanting work.

180
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,409
And I think to really replace that condition or

181
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:44,409
respond to the impacts, there should be trees in that zone.

182
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:55,193
And when I look at the sections that you've shown us, there are numerous trees in that area at the B and C section cuts and none shown in the plant.

183
00:20:55,213 --> 00:21:02,997
So it asks that you add some considerable tree planting into that area between the pathway and the shoreline.

184
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:04,218
That's all I've got.

185
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:15,751
All the other changes, invasive species removal, other aspects of the planting plan, I appreciate the updates and am satisfied with those.

186
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:16,332
Thank you.

187
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:17,753
Thanks.

188
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:23,119
I do have, on your first topic, you mentioned the proximity to the shoreline.

189
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:37,751
On the plan JP is showing right now where you see the pin oak just to the left of the pathway immediately south of that is a stormwater pond that manages runoff from the MBTA parking lot.

190
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:42,253
So we couldn't impact that nor the MBTA parking lot.

191
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:52,348
As part of our pathway alignment, and I think same goes for who will ultimately be working on the segment to the South.

192
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:54,590
I think there's consideration about.

193
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:00,734
How to align that pathway so that it doesn't impact the existing MBTA operation.

194
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:05,237
So that's really the driving reason beyond that specific location.

195
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:15,423
And then on the trees topic, I think we'd be happy to submit our final planting plan for the project prior to the start of the construction.

196
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:23,327
I don't think that should be a problem, you know, as everything's finalized and further refined.

197
00:22:26,544 --> 00:22:29,545
And I'll add to that, Natty, that we will commit to planting.

198
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:43,028
JP hasn't probably taken a look at exactly what and where we would do that, but to the extent he can do that and incorporate it in the next plan, we will commit to doing that planting.

199
00:22:43,668 --> 00:22:44,748
I think it's a great comment.

200
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:49,650
Great.

201
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,270
Thank you.

202
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:53,710
We appreciate that.

203
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,711
Regarding that southern transition,

204
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:09,991
I wonder if prior to construction, it would be helpful to have a plan detail for that specific area and how the grades will be met between.

205
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:15,974
Does that seem like a helpful thing once design has been furthered?

206
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:17,435
Absolutely.

207
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:20,296
We're happy to do that because we have to figure it out as well.

208
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:23,478
We'll be working together on that one.

209
00:23:24,301 --> 00:23:25,382
I agree as well, Heidi.

210
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:26,684
Thank you for that suggestion.

211
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:27,625
Great.

212
00:23:28,566 --> 00:23:30,248
Also, Jeremy, I ask your opinion.

213
00:23:30,388 --> 00:23:42,942
I also think we should keep the black locust because there isn't very many trees there, but do you feel that it should be contained as was suggested by Mr. Shatley?

214
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,311
I don't have a concern about black locust.

215
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:56,172
I agree with you that because there are so few existing trees that it's valuable habitat.

216
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:11,516
I think it is probably a good idea to keep them from expanding too much, especially if we're trying to establish new tree plantings in that same vicinity.

217
00:24:13,771 --> 00:24:22,177
So keep what's established there, but monitor and prevent any significant spreading of that growth.

218
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:27,521
So that can be addressed in the invasive species management plan?

219
00:24:28,122 --> 00:24:29,022
Correct.

220
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:32,505
That we will review prior to construction.

221
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,431
Anyone else?

222
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:43,553
I've got just a quick comment.

223
00:24:44,838 --> 00:24:55,826
Regarding the stormwater comments I had last meeting, I'm going to echo everyone else here in saying I appreciate the responsiveness to a lot of the comments that I had.

224
00:24:57,207 --> 00:25:02,511
I am going to echo something that you guys included in your supplemental information submittal.

225
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:09,717
I do appreciate the provision of that groundwater data.

226
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:23,188
But I'm going to recommend that the commission include a provision asking for confirmatory test pits prior to the start of construction.

227
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:27,330
Just acknowledging that that groundwater data is from the 1980s.

228
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:33,113
I work in the remediation field and groundwater data changes in 30, 40, gosh, years is a long time.

229
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:38,407
So it's great to get a feel for design.

230
00:25:38,427 --> 00:25:40,709
It's nice that there's a decent buffer above that.

231
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:47,617
But I do like the recommendation that the applicant put forward of doing confirmatory test codes.

232
00:25:47,637 --> 00:25:48,498
So that's my only comment.

233
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:50,099
Otherwise, I'm all set.

234
00:25:51,461 --> 00:25:52,242
Thanks, Greg.

235
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:57,027
Happy to do that, obviously, yes.

236
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:25,282
It seems like we don't have any further comments from the commission at the moment.

237
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:32,910
So just to confirm it, are there any members of the public here that would like to speak?

238
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:40,498
Hearing none, then back to the commission.

239
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,781
We are talking about several conditions.

240
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:56,546
So it appears that we believe that this project can be conditioned to meet the interests of that.

241
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:06,354
So let's talk about some specific conditions.

242
00:27:07,515 --> 00:27:14,541
And we've already mentioned them, but I want to, in particular, Craig, how does this sound?

243
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,961
As a possible condition regarding confirmation.

244
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:26,303
Soil valuations confirming at least 2 feet of separation between the infiltration.

245
00:27:27,283 --> 00:27:32,345
And estimated seasonal high groundwater shall be provided prior to the Pre construction meeting.

246
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:34,405
That works for me.

247
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:41,684
Excuse me, this is Nate Shield with Tetra Tech.

248
00:27:42,185 --> 00:27:45,748
Just one question or comment on that.

249
00:27:47,229 --> 00:28:02,882
Would it be possible to do test pits after demolition, just because part of each system, one sits partly within the existing building, and the other sits right in the footprint of the existing radio tower?

250
00:28:04,903 --> 00:28:14,586
As long as you guys think you'll have enough time to, in the event that seasonal high water is higher than anticipated, do you have time to pivot and adjust design to increase fill?

251
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,666
That's fine with me.

252
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:18,847
Okay, I would appreciate that.

253
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:23,309
I think, you know, when we pull the foundation out for the tower, that's probably a great test right there.

254
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:24,109
Fair enough.

255
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:24,649
Makes sense.

256
00:28:29,302 --> 00:28:32,123
Can I second forward that language to you if you'd like?

257
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:32,683
Thank you.

258
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:43,907
We also spoke about receivable plan detail at that southernmost transitional area.

259
00:28:43,927 --> 00:28:49,749
Prior to construction, yep, I've got that one.

260
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:52,290
And also a final planting plan prior to construction.

261
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:58,455
Acknowledging the commitment to planting, again, appreciated.

262
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:01,636
And that will be incorporated.

263
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:19,062
Also prior to construction, we want to receive for review and approval the invasive species management plan.

264
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:24,130
And the other thing that I think we need to look at is an overlaid historic issue.

265
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:32,135
So this parking zone actually puts a historic issue here, and I don't think it should be a historic issue.

266
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:34,816
Did I miss anything, or does anybody have any additions?

267
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:36,377
There's some historic issues.

268
00:29:36,437 --> 00:29:40,700
Heidi, I'd like to propose one and see how the commission receives it.

269
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,283
I'd actually propose it to be a general condition for all projects, but this one, it sparked my brain.

270
00:29:49,605 --> 00:30:04,076
no application of herbicides, pesticides, or enticides in resource areas, unless prior written consent from the commission, or I'm thinking for rodenticides, unless ordered by the Board of Health or something like that.

271
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:15,125
I understand where you're coming from, and I completely agree with the rodenticide.

272
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:18,108
However, in dealing with Phragmites,

273
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,799
I'm not sure that herbicides can be.

274
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,184
Without herbicides, I'm not sure that management is effective.

275
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:40,332
Yes, and my intent is not to prohibit herbicide use with invasive species, so we may have to work that out.

276
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:46,557
But I meant, you know, for like lawn care, I don't want, you know, fertilizers put down and stuff like that.

277
00:30:50,106 --> 00:30:56,588
Approval of the invasive species management plan would count as written approval by the commission to use those pesticides.

278
00:30:58,449 --> 00:31:01,710
Yeah, I agree, Greg.

279
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:09,434
For that purpose, for that length of time, and then just a shared spreadsheet.

280
00:31:09,574 --> 00:31:12,335
You're basically talking about aftercare maintenance.

281
00:31:13,334 --> 00:31:16,335
If I'm understanding you, yeah, which makes sense.

282
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:22,578
I mean, that's along the same lines as snow plan, et cetera, that basic maintenance.

283
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:23,998
I agree with Carolyn on that.

284
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,880
But we're going to need pesticides.

285
00:31:29,681 --> 00:31:36,804
If you guys have, I don't know who else is familiar with that area, but we're definitely going to have to use pesticides.

286
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,073
Whoops, did we freeze up?

287
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:55,277
Speaking of storage areas, that was one of our comments, and I believe it was addressed, but it wasn't mentioned in the overview.

288
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:58,438
Are there designated snow storage areas?

289
00:31:59,338 --> 00:31:59,998
There are, yes.

290
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:03,540
They're shown on the frozen sedimentation plan.

291
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,081
I didn't see that.

292
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:07,521
Yeah, I did.

293
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:12,943
Caroline, this might... Jump off the screen share for a second.

294
00:32:12,983 --> 00:32:14,304
Everyone can see each other.

295
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:30,214
Carolyn, this may be just me not knowing things I should know, but would the provision regarding pesticides or denticides and stuff occur after notice of termination is filed?

296
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:32,894
Does that stay on the property upon completion of construction?

297
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,556
You mean certificate of compliance?

298
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:36,836
Sorry.

299
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:38,856
Yeah, I'm thinking Swift language.

300
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:39,577
Yes, sorry.

301
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:46,319
I'm thinking it would be a condition in perpetuity and survive the order of conditions.

302
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:48,463
gotcha.

303
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:54,505
It's also like, it's like, I will talk about the past.

304
00:32:56,145 --> 00:33:05,907
And for swear, but some language reporting specifically for treatment of invasive species.

305
00:33:05,927 --> 00:33:12,089
I can't

306
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,779
I'm able to send file to the admin restriction, sorry.

307
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:20,440
I don't know why.

308
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:41,965
Can someone send me one that I can use and what I can do is I can add it in there and then Heidi, I can share it to you and one of the other members of the commission just to see how the language sounds before I actually send it out for signatures.

309
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,430
Okay, I could read it out loud.

310
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:46,551
Fairly straightforward.

311
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:55,933
If needed, use of herbicides to control invasive species shall be implemented in accordance with the approved IPMS and with the following requirements.

312
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:59,694
Herbicide shall only be applied by a licensed applicator.

313
00:34:00,755 --> 00:34:09,317
Only herbicides registered with the Massachusetts Pesticide Board Subcommittee shall be applied to the targeted area slash species.

314
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:17,830
The manufacturer's label directions must be followed in addition to any conditions imposed by other state or local authorities.

315
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:27,164
Herbicide application shall use no more than the minimum application rate to accomplish removal of the target species.

316
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:41,331
And applicants must obtain a BRP WM04 herbicide permit from MassDEP Wetlands Program, the dredge unit, before performing herbicide application in water bodies.

317
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:46,092
And this is traditionally lakes and ponds, so probably not applicable here.

318
00:34:52,914 --> 00:34:53,854
Sounds good to me.

319
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:07,700
Okay, good.

320
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:17,287
Any other discussion?

321
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:22,631
Do I have a motion?

322
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:37,213
I'll make a motion to issue an order of conditions that includes the five aforementioned special conditions discussed by the commission this evening.

323
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:38,754
Second that.

324
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:41,316
Excellent.

325
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:42,416
All in favor?

326
00:35:43,017 --> 00:35:43,097
Aye.

327
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:43,377
Aye.

328
00:35:43,457 --> 00:35:43,577
Aye.

329
00:35:44,498 --> 00:35:44,638
Aye.

330
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:45,138
Aye.

331
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:45,399
Aye.

332
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:45,559
Aye.

333
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:45,719
Aye.

334
00:35:46,399 --> 00:35:46,479
Aye.

335
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,580
Aye.

336
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:58,176
And Jeremy's and I also, I'm so sorry, Jeremy, I didn't see you.

337
00:35:58,596 --> 00:35:59,057
That's okay.

338
00:35:59,077 --> 00:36:02,480
I'm off the screen, but I agree with all the conditions.

339
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:02,981
Thank you.

340
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:05,403
You're very welcome.

341
00:36:07,285 --> 00:36:08,086
Thank you very much.

342
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:11,329
Thank you everyone.

343
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:12,270
Thank you.

344
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:16,174
So I should have the, I'm going to write the order.

345
00:36:16,194 --> 00:36:17,195
I've already got the.

346
00:36:18,515 --> 00:36:20,116
bunch of it like already filled in.

347
00:36:20,156 --> 00:36:21,937
So I'll add the conditions.

348
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:25,759
I'll just send it off to just Heidi and another member just to sort of do a double check.

349
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,141
And then once that's completed, I'll send it off to them for their signatures.

350
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:31,583
And I'll let you know when it's signed and stamped and filed.

351
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,220
Excellent.

352
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,060
Thank you very much.

353
00:36:35,841 --> 00:36:36,722
Just one more thing.

354
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:48,806
I'm especially appreciative that this company is willing to go ahead and complete that work with the potential and probably realistic anticipation of the loss of funds.

355
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:50,947
Thank you.

356
00:36:51,928 --> 00:36:53,688
I think we're probably going to have to do it.

357
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:54,869
So we're just prepared.

358
00:36:54,929 --> 00:36:55,929
I think you are as well.

359
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:56,750
So thank you.

360
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,470
Yeah.

361
00:36:58,644 --> 00:36:59,464
Thank you, everyone.

362
00:36:59,945 --> 00:37:01,786
Well, one bit of housekeeping, if I may.

363
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:16,113
A file number was recently assigned, so if you could please make sure that DEP's Northeast Regional Office has a copy of the supplemental material referencing that file number, then it could get matched up with the notice of intent.

364
00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:20,456
Yeah, I'll send that along to them right after I pop off.

365
00:37:21,117 --> 00:37:21,337
Great.

366
00:37:21,397 --> 00:37:21,677
Thanks.

367
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,720
It doesn't look like it's been reviewed by the analyst assigned to it yet.

368
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,982
So that will certainly help with their review.

369
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:29,062
Okay.

370
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:30,283
Thank you.

371
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:33,045
You're very welcome.

372
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:39,610
Best of luck with the project going forward and we will probably.

373
00:37:40,543 --> 00:37:42,464
see you at the pre-construction meeting.

374
00:37:42,484 --> 00:37:44,804
Yes, looking forward to it.

375
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,225
Thank you very much.

376
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:47,145
Appreciate it.

377
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:47,825
Thank you.

378
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:48,445
You're very welcome.

379
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:48,805
Thank you.

380
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:49,626
Bye-bye.

381
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:50,006
Good night.

382
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:50,926
Good evening.

383
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:58,408
I'm old enough that KISS Radio was part of much earlier time in my life.

384
00:38:02,924 --> 00:38:06,066
My sister went over there when she was in high school to record.

385
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:10,469
She won some sort of, like, it was an American Legion contest for like some sort of speech.

386
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:14,812
And she went and she won it from Edford, so she had to go over there to record it to go out to the state level.

387
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:18,494
And that took me along, because I was a wee lad.

388
00:38:18,534 --> 00:38:21,576
And it was actually kind of cool being in an active radio station.

389
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:23,577
But, uh.

390
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,282
So just, uh, somebody else, I actually,

391
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:35,305
I am talking to a prospective new member on Monday.

392
00:38:35,325 --> 00:38:41,148
Um, I actually, cause I go through like, we have this like smart sheets thing that sort of lists people.

393
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,790
And I was, there just was nobody really who was for the com com.

394
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,052
And then I decided to just start looking at everybody who's applied.

395
00:38:47,553 --> 00:38:50,875
And I found an environmental engineer who was just applying for the bike commission.

396
00:38:51,475 --> 00:38:55,218
So I just emailed him outright and I said, Hey, would you be interested?

397
00:38:55,238 --> 00:38:56,398
And he said, let me talk.

398
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,159
So I'm meeting him, talking to him Monday.

399
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:58,340
So.

400
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,502
I think seems pretty, pretty energetic.

401
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:04,323
So I think that'd be good.

402
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,103
So, um, hopefully enough.

403
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:07,904
And then I'm going to actually search through everyone now.

404
00:39:07,924 --> 00:39:11,406
Cause like he was literally, he just, he just put in his information.

405
00:39:11,966 --> 00:39:13,367
And so it was literally very top ones.

406
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:19,210
And I'm just going to start scrolling through everybody to see if someone who maybe just hadn't thought about the con com or things like that.

407
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,672
So, and, um, good luck.

408
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:24,352
Thank you.

409
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:27,624
Well, I make a good first impression.

410
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:28,724
My second impression, not so much.

411
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:31,586
First impression is great, so I think we're okay on that end.

412
00:39:32,106 --> 00:39:34,107
All you need is the mayor's office to play ball.

413
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:46,653
Yes, which it hasn't just been us, it's been a few other boards of commissions, so they are ready to not have that happen again.

414
00:39:47,353 --> 00:39:51,295
So we're between our office and a few other offices.

415
00:39:52,636 --> 00:39:54,937
Yeah, if people are willing to volunteer,

416
00:39:56,502 --> 00:39:58,963
Snag them before we'll do so.

417
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:06,546
And no other, we should have a, we should have a meeting in 2 weeks.

418
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:12,568
I received a notice of intent for some work.

419
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:14,709
Along the.

420
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:38,133
the river and within the drill buffer zone stuff down on west bedford that we talked about before so that should be all in place ready to go for our next meeting and actually the next door neighbor is doing something similar so they might be ready as well so um we might actually have two filings for pretty much almost identical cases that would be august 6 correct thank you

421
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,633
and which might be kind of a first.

422
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:47,156
So, because I mean, they are literally right next door to each other.

423
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:53,902
Because we had this, we had something that both came before the zoning board about a month apart, and it was basically the exact same thing.

424
00:40:53,942 --> 00:41:05,952
So when I had to write the zoning decision for that, I, for the first, I mean, I usually use older ones as a blow over plate or, you know, something to work off, but this was the exact same case.

425
00:41:05,972 --> 00:41:07,053
I just had to change numbers.

426
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:08,374
OK.

427
00:41:08,394 --> 00:41:10,336
So it's very fortuitous.

428
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:16,279
But speaking of writing, we actually do have meeting minutes that could be approved.

429
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,100
Yes.

430
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,302
OK.

431
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:23,324
Thank you for handing those over, Dennis.

432
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,425
It's particularly helpful for Heather.

433
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:26,425
Yes.

434
00:41:27,286 --> 00:41:27,686
Thank you.

435
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:29,327
The format's interesting.

436
00:41:30,348 --> 00:41:35,251
It's kind of not a big deal, but the section on my comments missed some of my comments.

437
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:35,731
OK.

438
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:36,732
Oh, well.

439
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:45,092
Those might have been attributed to me, Heidi, because I was attributed a lot of comments that I did a lot of good comments that I didn't make.

440
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:46,553
They might be in my section.

441
00:41:48,574 --> 00:41:48,994
That's all right.

442
00:41:49,014 --> 00:41:50,195
You can have them.

443
00:41:51,335 --> 00:41:54,117
Engineering and stormwater comments that I know nothing about.

444
00:41:56,418 --> 00:41:57,018
Take the credit.

445
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:57,719
Yeah.

446
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:05,043
But so I think that we can approve them if I have a motion.

447
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,464
We have a motion with a second.

448
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:13,265
For tonight.

449
00:42:13,385 --> 00:42:14,445
Was that a motion?

450
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:15,886
If you motioned it, I'll second.

451
00:42:15,926 --> 00:42:17,226
No, just thinking ahead.

452
00:42:17,706 --> 00:42:19,486
All right.

453
00:42:21,787 --> 00:42:22,067
OK.

454
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,687
We have a motion and a second, so let's.

455
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:25,567
Great.

456
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:26,468
All in favor.

457
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:27,228
Caroline.

458
00:42:28,008 --> 00:42:28,148
Aye.

459
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:29,348
Eric.

460
00:42:30,128 --> 00:42:30,248
Aye.

461
00:42:31,028 --> 00:42:31,328
Heather.

462
00:42:32,129 --> 00:42:32,269
Aye.

463
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:33,429
Craig.

464
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:34,249
Aye.

465
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:38,450
Jeremy and myself, isn't I?

466
00:42:41,272 --> 00:42:43,253
Dennis, can I say one thing before we jump off?

467
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:44,253
Yeah, go ahead.

468
00:42:44,693 --> 00:42:55,959
While I have an environmental audience, the law firm I'm working for is looking to hire environmental land use and zoning attorney, if anyone knows of anyone looking full-time, part-time.

469
00:42:55,979 --> 00:43:01,161
We're in downtown Boston, are really great people to work with, good firm.

470
00:43:02,302 --> 00:43:03,042
And that's my plug.

471
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:09,312
Email me and I can give you my work email or send you the link to our law firm.

472
00:43:12,774 --> 00:43:21,799
But also I wanted to speak to the topic you brought up earlier today, Caroline, regarding the Mass Ready Act.

473
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,581
Yes, that was.

474
00:43:25,601 --> 00:43:30,984
And we have been neglected to move forward on the

475
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:37,551
under the bylaw language that you drafted.

476
00:43:38,712 --> 00:43:44,177
I believe I reviewed it several months ago, but I definitely need to go over it again.

477
00:43:44,217 --> 00:43:55,426
And I suggest that we dedicate a meeting date to review and discussion of that so that we can move it forward because it doesn't seem to happen if we just tack it on the end of our regular schedule.

478
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:00,490
Yeah, I agree.

479
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,531
I think that'd be a great idea.

480
00:44:02,356 --> 00:44:10,181
And I would suggest it's probably more than one meeting, but just getting one on the books would be a good start, I think.

481
00:44:10,201 --> 00:44:12,782
I also have a question on this.

482
00:44:13,002 --> 00:44:14,883
Heidi, maybe you know a bit more.

483
00:44:15,584 --> 00:44:18,105
There are pending regulatory revisions.

484
00:44:21,547 --> 00:44:29,432
Do you anticipate this being a two-step process, meaning they would promulgate those new revisions and then tackle what's in the Mass Saves Act?

485
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:32,749
That's hard.

486
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:33,849
That's hard to answer.

487
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:40,191
The regulatory revisions are being proposed by DEP.

488
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,452
And I'm not sure where they are exactly.

489
00:44:45,792 --> 00:44:48,973
And Mass Ready Act is proposed by the legislature.

490
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:53,594
So it's two different bodies.

491
00:44:54,294 --> 00:44:55,015
I'm not sure how

492
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:11,884
But to be fair, I've been primarily focused on the Chapter 91 stuff in the Mass SAVE Act, but doesn't the statutory changes, does it direct DEP to make regulatory amendments, or is it all statutory?

493
00:45:11,904 --> 00:45:14,625
Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't know, Eric.

494
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:19,527
I'm not involved, unfortunately, with any of that, or maybe fortunately.

495
00:45:21,697 --> 00:45:28,062
Is this like the changes coming to the stormwater design standards for MAS, or is this completely separate?

496
00:45:29,764 --> 00:45:32,466
The regulatory revisions address stormwater changes.

497
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:42,814
The MAS Ready Act covers exemptions for culverts, 40Bs, and what else?

498
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,156
That's the two I'm aware of.

499
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:45,917
Do you know, Caroline?

500
00:45:46,956 --> 00:45:52,598
It was, broadly speaking, priority projects, which I think is primarily housing.

501
00:45:52,678 --> 00:45:59,560
But it does include ecological restoration and resiliency, vulnerability projects.

502
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,220
Right.

503
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:06,702
Any energy-related or climate resiliency as bypasses of permitting.

504
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:11,283
Bypasses permitting.

505
00:46:11,303 --> 00:46:15,365
So that's the streamlined permitting section that the AI overview is spitting out.

506
00:46:16,825 --> 00:46:18,066
Summary of the Mass Ready Act.

507
00:46:18,086 --> 00:46:18,487
Interesting.

508
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:19,127
Okay.

509
00:46:19,848 --> 00:46:20,169
Thank you.

510
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:21,650
I'm not as in tuned with.

511
00:46:23,452 --> 00:46:33,322
And what is really interesting to me is the suggestion that appeals of orders of conditions would not go to the regional office.

512
00:46:36,345 --> 00:46:38,167
What would be the alternative order they proposing?

513
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:39,830
Just back here.

514
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:40,471
Superior court.

515
00:46:40,851 --> 00:46:41,451
Superior court.

516
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:42,031
Yeah.

517
00:46:42,692 --> 00:46:56,898
There was an email today from the association that I only skimmed asking people to submit comments by the deadline on the 28th, I believe.

518
00:46:56,938 --> 00:47:02,260
And it noted a few good things in the bill and some other sections that are causing concern.

519
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,023
Is this from MACC?

520
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:07,603
Yes.

521
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,283
What do they consider good?

522
00:47:10,683 --> 00:47:12,344
I'm curious.

523
00:47:12,404 --> 00:47:13,244
Good things in the bill.

524
00:47:13,304 --> 00:47:16,565
There is great funding for several important environmental programs.

525
00:47:16,985 --> 00:47:21,026
Electronic notices using electronic delivery will streamline and reduce costs.

526
00:47:21,546 --> 00:47:27,787
The abutter notification typo has been fixed from 1,000 feet of a linear project to 100 feet of a linear project.

527
00:47:28,488 --> 00:47:36,009
There's a new procedure for permitting projects with negligible or minor wetland impacts not requiring NOIs or public hearings.

528
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:38,510
Yeah, that's the culvert one, unfortunately.

529
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:44,872
There's a ninth interest of the Wetlands Protection Act proposed for climate change resilience.

530
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:49,853
Unfortunately, they don't get into as much detail in the sections causing concern.

531
00:47:49,873 --> 00:47:51,554
They just reference the section numbers.

532
00:47:52,534 --> 00:47:57,975
The one about exempting culverts really troubles me.

533
00:47:59,696 --> 00:48:01,256
That's section 74.

534
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,317
DPWs can go ahead and do it.

535
00:48:08,224 --> 00:48:10,525
We've had a lot of experience with that here in Medford.

536
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:12,386
Yes.

537
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:28,616
If we can close the public hearing, just one other non-hearing item.

538
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:31,397
Need a motion that?

539
00:48:31,938 --> 00:48:32,118
Yeah.

540
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:35,219
Do I have a motion to close the hearing?

541
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:36,680
Motion to close the hearing.

542
00:48:37,361 --> 00:48:37,781
Seconded.

543
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:40,221
All in favor, Caroline.

544
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:41,121
Aye.

545
00:48:41,582 --> 00:48:41,882
Eric.

546
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:42,623
Aye.

547
00:48:43,904 --> 00:48:44,184
Heather.

548
00:48:44,845 --> 00:48:44,965
Aye.

549
00:48:45,446 --> 00:48:45,726
Craig.

550
00:48:46,447 --> 00:48:46,567
Aye.

551
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:47,528
Jeremy.

552
00:48:47,988 --> 00:48:48,589
Aye.

553
00:48:48,649 --> 00:48:49,430
Myself is an aye.

554
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,292
Great.

555
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:54,735
I am remiss because I
