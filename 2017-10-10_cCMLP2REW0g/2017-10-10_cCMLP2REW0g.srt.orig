[SPEAKER_03]: I find all the papers in order.

45
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:21,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just a few questions to the petitioner.

46
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:26,761
[SPEAKER_03]: As this is just a transfer, you're taking over, are you maintaining the same business?

47
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:27,381
Yes.

48
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:28,662
[SPEAKER_03]: So nothing's changing?

49
00:03:28,782 --> 00:03:29,222
[SPEAKER_06]: No change.

50
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,464

[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

58
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:52,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

59
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Good luck.

60
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:53,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

61
00:03:53,614 --> 00:03:53,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Good luck.

62
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:53,854
17, 696.

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:27,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your own body approves the appropriation of free cash in the amount of $10,000 to fund the purchase of cameras for code enforcement in compliance with Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 148A, Code Enforcement Officer Section 5, Fines, Penalties, and Assessment.

64
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:30,922
[SPEAKER_17]: The balance of free cash before this vote is $7 million.

65
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:40,620
[SPEAKER_17]: $823,993.

66
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:40,620
[SPEAKER_17]: The revised free cash as of 6-30-17 has not been certified by the state at the time.

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,181
[SPEAKER_17]: City Commissioner John Bavuso is here to present and answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

68
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:50,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Bavuso.

69
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:55,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

70
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:57,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Carviello.

71
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:00,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Ravuso, for coming to explain this.

72
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:05,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe just a little more detail about what type of cameras, how many we're purchasing, what they're going to do, just a little more detail.

73
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:14,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, three high quality commercial grade infrared night vision cameras that are what they call quick deploy.

74
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,630
[SPEAKER_05]: It means that we can set them up and move them very simply.

75
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:27,133
[SPEAKER_05]: They're self-contained, they come with a router, they transmit to our cellular data network, they'll be monitored at the police station, and hopefully we'll get a receiver at City Hall in the near future.

76
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:32,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could, what's the reasoning for getting the cameras?

77
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:34,534
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we going to be doing with them?

78
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:36,234
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to monitor.

79
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:39,375
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of dumping sites throughout the city that happens.

80
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:40,736
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some favorite sites that went.

81
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:43,597
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a few problems downtown recently with

82
00:05:45,348 --> 00:05:47,070
[SPEAKER_05]: Small thievery, petty stuff.

83
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Some elderly people have been slightly harassed by the people hanging out in the square.

84
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:54,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So we hope that they have the cameras.

85
00:05:54,155 --> 00:06:00,841
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be able to let us see anybody caught in the act of bothering somebody or stealing anything, any criminal activity.

86
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:05,024
[SPEAKER_09]: So they'll be portable and you'll be able to move them around and catch them?

87
00:06:05,044 --> 00:06:05,464
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

88
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:05,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay.

89
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:07,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you.

90
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:07,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

91
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:10,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Knight.

92
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

93
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Bavuso, thank you for that presentation.

94
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:22,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, Mr. President, this council has requested the purchase of portable security cameras for the purpose of court enforcement on numerous occasions in the past.

95
00:06:22,869 --> 00:06:26,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we have an opportunity to appropriate the funding to make that a reality and move approval.

96
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

97
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Marks.

98
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

99
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:37,191
[SPEAKER_16]: As Councilman Light just mentioned, this has been a request of this council for the past several years.

100
00:06:37,952 --> 00:06:40,372
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would hope that â€” I know these are portable,

101
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:49,534
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would hope that one of the first stops will be Commercial Street and the dumping that has taken place on Commercial Street over the years.

102
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:52,496
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would hope that would be one of the first stops.

103
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,818
[SPEAKER_16]: It is absolutely high on the list.

104
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:55,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it is.

105
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:02,724
[SPEAKER_16]: That area is notorious for all sorts of garbage refrigerators, you name it, sofas.

106
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:09,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything shows up on that street because it's poorly lit at night and there's not much traffic there at all.

107
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,477
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a constant problem.

108
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:14,498
[SPEAKER_16]: I support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

109
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:16,860
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

110
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

111
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I follow my colleagues in this endeavor.

112
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:28,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that what we'll get back in fines and penalties would be tenfold, and I think it would be automatically.

113
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:35,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate your work in making this come to fruition, and I support this wholeheartedly.

114
00:07:35,213 --> 00:07:35,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

115
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:36,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Counselor.

116
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe this is just a start.

117
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:42,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that what we're going to get from these three cameras is going to show us how valuable they are.

118
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:43,035
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.

119
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:43,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

120
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:44,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Falco.

121
00:07:45,136 --> 00:07:46,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

122
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:48,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Bavuzzo, thank you very much for your report as well.

123
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,240
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something I support 100%.

124
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,601
[SPEAKER_11]: We've needed this for a long time.

125
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:57,082
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know this council has talked about this repeatedly.

126
00:07:57,622 --> 00:07:58,723
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have a quick question.

127
00:07:59,343 --> 00:08:01,184
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as the cameras go, I mean, how many?

128
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:02,625
[SPEAKER_11]: We're starting off with three.

129
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:04,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, ideally, do you think we could use more?

130
00:08:05,797 --> 00:08:06,558
[SPEAKER_05]: ideally could.

131
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:09,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are high quality camera.

132
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,301
[SPEAKER_05]: They are about $3,000, a little more than $3,000 each.

133
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:18,885
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'd like to get the cameras and use, make sure they're working up to our expectations and begin collecting some money back for them.

134
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:19,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.

135
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:28,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And as far as, um, you know, as far as I'm just thinking, as far as the future goes and from a budgeting perspective, do you know what the life expectancy is for one of these cameras, especially if they're outside?

136
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:32,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I'm just, you know, is this something that you have to purchase on a pretty regular basis?

137
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:35,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the life expectancy is.

138
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:39,700
[SPEAKER_05]: The company that we're contracted to does all the maintenance and warranty work on them.

139
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,223
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, it's a high quality commercial grade camera they use throughout the city of Boston, the city of Somerville.

140
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:51,486
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have looked at that and I don't know what the life period is, but they're made for exposure to the elements.

141
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:51,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

142
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:52,446
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay.

143
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:54,307
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, uh, this is, I think a great initiative.

144
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:57,408
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad to see that we're moving forward with it and move approval.

145
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:57,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

146
00:08:59,109 --> 00:08:59,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor DelaRusso.

147
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

148
00:09:05,232 --> 00:09:06,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilman O'Karen.

149
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:08,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Just one quick question.

150
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:13,039
[SPEAKER_09]: You said there's going to be a router and the video will come up at the police station?

151
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:13,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

152
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:22,348
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you find out there was dumping, then your office building department will go to the police station to review the footage?

153
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:23,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

154
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:23,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

155
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:24,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's how it's going to work.

156
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,253
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to have somebody sitting there and reviewing hours long data.

157
00:09:28,293 --> 00:09:30,696
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just going to be if something happened, then we'll know.

158
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:35,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, it'll be recorded so we can back up the time frame and see who was there.

159
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:37,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Figured, but I just want to be clear.

160
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:37,886
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

161
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:45,071
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor De La Russo.

162
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:45,812
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

163
00:09:45,832 --> 00:09:46,052
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

164
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:50,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me, roll call vote is requested, is required.

165
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:53,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor De La Russo?

166
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:54,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

167
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:55,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

168
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:55,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

169
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:56,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Night?

170
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:56,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

171
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor McKernan?

172
00:09:58,101 --> 00:09:58,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

173
00:09:58,621 --> 00:09:59,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President March?

174
00:09:59,582 --> 00:09:59,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

175
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:00,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scott Deli?

176
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:01,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

177
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

178
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:07,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

179
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Babuso.

180
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:24,490
[SPEAKER_17]: 17699, dear President Caravaglio and members of the city council, I respectfully request that the council endorse an approval of food trucks for the Brooks PTO fundraiser that will be held at the Brooks Elementary School on October 22, 2017.

181
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your consideration.

182
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Stephanie M. Bergmaier.

183
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor DelaRusso?

184
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Move approval.

185
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,272
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

186
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:38,933
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

187
00:10:39,753 --> 00:10:40,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

188
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:46,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

189
00:10:46,736 --> 00:10:47,396
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

190
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:55,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

191
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,902
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-684 offered by Councilor Knight being resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the administration

192
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:10,179
[SPEAKER_17]: expand upon its Adopt-a-Site program to include the grass islands extending from Southwater Road to Lawrence Road.

193
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Counselor Knight.

194
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

195
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:18,749
[SPEAKER_07]: As we've seen throughout the community, the Adopt-a-Site program has been very successful in certain locations.

196
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Along Lawrence Road and Governor's Avenue, Mr. President, if you take a look,

197
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:27,537
[SPEAKER_07]: you will see that some of the islands are adopted and some aren't.

198
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:33,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have one island that looks great, another island that doesn't look so great, one island that looks great, another island that doesn't look so great.

199
00:11:33,522 --> 00:11:35,804
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a little bit of inconsistency there, Mr. President.

200
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:44,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a very successful framework in place, and I'm asking the administration to see if they can seek volunteers to go there and adopt that site, Mr. President, so that we can beautify the neighborhood a little bit more.

201
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:50,035
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some inconsistencies along that stretch of roadway, and I think that this will do a lot for curb appeal.

202
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:54,515
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

203
00:11:54,535 --> 00:11:55,155
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

204
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:58,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

205
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:00,418
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-685 offered by Vice President Mox.

206
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:07,502
[SPEAKER_17]: We have resolved that the city administration provide the council with an update on the water leak detection program.

207
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:08,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Mox.

208
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:11,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

209
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:16,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, this is probably the third time I've offered this as a council resolution.

210
00:12:16,995 --> 00:12:28,668
[SPEAKER_16]: that we receive an update on the proposal that was submitted by this administration back, I think it was roughly a year ago, myself and I know there were a couple other members of the city council.

211
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:54,558
[SPEAKER_16]: attended a meeting up here that talked about purchasing a device on behalf of the community that would be able to gauge where leaks are coming from and to have a systematic approach to replacing the water pipes where they're leaking in order to save the beleaguered

212
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Rate pay is some money, Mr. President.

213
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:07,052
[SPEAKER_16]: So I ask, my first request is to ask where we stand on the leak detection program that was proposed to this council some time back.

214
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:19,782
[SPEAKER_16]: It's also, Mr. President, to once again ask that we take a full look at our infrastructure when it comes to water and sewer.

215
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,942
[SPEAKER_16]: Just for the edification of the viewing audience, the water for 2017 this year was assessed at $6,432,219.

216
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:28,003
[SPEAKER_16]: That is no increase over 2016.

217
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:29,783
[SPEAKER_16]: On the suicide for 2017, the assessment was

218
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,843
[SPEAKER_16]: $11,878,789.

219
00:13:44,243 --> 00:13:45,843
[SPEAKER_16]: That was an increase of $525,541, which is a 4.6% increase over 2016 on the sewer side.

220
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:51,804
[SPEAKER_16]: And the combined assessment that the rate payers in this community, every taxpayer is paying for, is water and sewer assessment is $18 million.

221
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:19,196
[SPEAKER_16]: $311,008, and of which we also add in the expense of the water and sewer division, which is $5,635,854, bringing the total budget for water and sewer for 2017 to $23,946,862.

222
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:21,537
[SPEAKER_16]: The reason why I bring this up tonight, Mr. President, as we all know,

223
00:14:39,853 --> 00:14:49,441
[SPEAKER_16]: The MWRA back, I believe it was about a year ago, stated that Meffitt had approximately 20% for unaccounted for water in the community.

224
00:14:50,262 --> 00:14:59,110
[SPEAKER_16]: And as part of unaccounted for water, that consists of leaks that are taking place, and that's why I'm calling for an update on the leak detection program.

225
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:10,097
[SPEAKER_16]: It also takes into consideration other usage in the community that's not needed right now, which are many of our hydrants throughout the community.

226
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:21,407
[SPEAKER_16]: And it also takes into consideration the unaccounted for water, the municipal and school side, Mr. President, which used to be part of their budget respectively.

227
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:23,969
[SPEAKER_16]: So the schools would pay for a water and sewer bill.

228
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,158
[SPEAKER_16]: depending on the water they used.

229
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:39,988
[SPEAKER_16]: And the last figure I received, and this is from 2017, I believe, was the school side, based on a tier two system, their water and sewer bill

230
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:40,845
[SPEAKER_16]: was $190,457.

231
00:15:41,085 --> 00:15:47,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, we all know that that used to be part of the school department budget.

232
00:15:48,171 --> 00:16:01,000
[SPEAKER_16]: And back some years ago, they took it out of the budget and stopped considering it an operating expense and just passed it off to the rate payers on the water and suicide as unaccounted for.

233
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:04,403
[SPEAKER_16]: But indeed, Mr. President, it's not unaccounted for.

234
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:05,849
[SPEAKER_16]: It is needed.

235
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:08,591
[SPEAKER_16]: We know where the water is coming from.

236
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:17,740
[SPEAKER_16]: And in my opinion, it sends out an awful message when we're talking about conservation and ways to better utilize our resources.

237
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:30,271
[SPEAKER_16]: When you have a school department or a municipality that really doesn't pay for the water and sewer because they pass the burden on to the rate payer, I think sends an awful message, Mr. President.

238
00:16:30,858 --> 00:16:35,663
[SPEAKER_16]: and it should be accounted for under the accounting principles within a budget.

239
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,987
[SPEAKER_16]: So according to the MWRA, 20% of our water that we take in, 20% of that $6,432,219

240
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:48,272
[SPEAKER_16]: dollars is unaccounted for water.

241
00:16:48,973 --> 00:17:07,763
[SPEAKER_16]: That's roughly $1,200,000 in unaccounted for water, of which about $393,000, almost $400,000 is from the municipal and the school side, and $800,000 of leaks that are happening under our roads, Mr. President.

242
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:14,207
[SPEAKER_16]: And things that we really need to have a leak detection program in order to cut that cost down.

243
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,654
[SPEAKER_16]: and pass that savings on to the ratepayers.

244
00:17:18,574 --> 00:17:28,798
[SPEAKER_16]: And so tonight, Mr. President, I ask that we, first of all, get an update on the leak detection program, where it stands right now.

245
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:41,182
[SPEAKER_16]: I once again ask, and I've asked a half a dozen times, that water and sewer need to be included, Mr. President, in the operating budget of both the municipal and the school sides.

246
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,860
[SPEAKER_16]: That should happen without any say.

247
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,542
[SPEAKER_16]: That should be an arctic mathematic, Mr. President.

248
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:59,528
[SPEAKER_16]: If we're going to ask ratepayers to, depending on what tier they fall in, if they use less water, they can save on their bill and also conserve.

249
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:04,671
[SPEAKER_16]: We should also be demanding the same from the municipality and from the school side.

250
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,292
[SPEAKER_16]: That should be a given.

251
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:11,295
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that it be included back into the operating expense

252
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:15,754
[SPEAKER_16]: for the water for the schools and for City Hall.

253
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:20,436
[SPEAKER_16]: As part of that $400,000, I alluded to the schools was $190,000.

254
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,457
[SPEAKER_16]: The municipal buildings, about $43,000.

255
00:18:21,537 --> 00:18:23,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Irrigation, which is probably 95%.

256
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:25,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Our parks is $152,000.

257
00:18:25,358 --> 00:18:30,060
[SPEAKER_16]: And then in our different fire stations throughout the community,

258
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,114
[SPEAKER_16]: little over $6,000, Mr. President.

259
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:55,602
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you add that up, it comes to about $393,000, almost $400,000 in water and sewer consumption that we know where it's coming from, it's needed, and it should be part of an operating expense, Mr. President.

260
00:18:55,943 --> 00:19:08,950
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd put that in the form of a motion that we get a response back on those questions immediately on behalf of the ratepayers of this community, Mr. President, that are paying thousands of dollars in water and sewer a year.

261
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:14,249
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there's a way we can save money through INI inflow.

262
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,183
[SPEAKER_16]: in an account just for that purpose.

263
00:19:39,623 --> 00:19:44,644
[SPEAKER_16]: The water and sewer enterprise account was created for that purpose, to offset rates.

264
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:49,086
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the state legislature that created it, not myself, not this council.

265
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:52,467
[SPEAKER_16]: To offset rates and to do infrastructure improvements.

266
00:19:53,627 --> 00:20:04,630
[SPEAKER_16]: What better improvement, Mr. President, to tighten up a system that ratepayers are paying millions of dollars a year for unaccounted for water and for I&I, inflow and infiltration.

267
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,431
[SPEAKER_16]: What better use of that money?

268
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:10,754
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know anyone that would stand up against that, Mr. President.

269
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:14,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Instead, that money is sitting in an account, just sitting there.

270
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:22,983
[SPEAKER_16]: And every day that goes by is an injustice to every resident in this community that's paying a water and sewer bill, as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President.

271
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:23,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

272
00:20:23,964 --> 00:20:25,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

273
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:31,370
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Vice President Marks, seconded by Councilor Lockhart.

274
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:31,990
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

275
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:32,231
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

276
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:33,712
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

277
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:51,786
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-686, offered by Councilor Longo-Kern, be it resolved that once the free cash from last year is certified, that a portion of it be used to hire an outside company to help the Memphis City Council update the city of Memphis zoning laws.

278
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:53,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

279
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Carviello.

280
00:20:56,329 --> 00:21:03,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is something that we had asked for to be funded one way or another several months back.

281
00:21:03,985 --> 00:21:08,788
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe there was one maybe subcommittee meeting on it, but I think it's something that needs to be done.

282
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:13,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I then asked a question of, can we work on our zoning one section at a time?

283
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:30,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we're the ones that, which update the ordinances, but we were told in a written decision that that would be spot zoning, but we are going to be approached with a number of projects coming down the line, which almost seems similar to that.

284
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:32,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's something that,

285
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:39,893
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to have a commitment by the administration to hire an outside company to help guide us through this process.

286
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:55,182
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're all capable of going street by street and deciding which zoning changes we should make, but to handle this, which is gonna take, from what I understand, multiple years to do.

287
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:59,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the city of Somerville, it took a couple years to get through the process.

288
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,167
[SPEAKER_09]: We need some guidance and we need some commitment

289
00:22:02,477 --> 00:22:05,439
[SPEAKER_09]: by the administration so we can move forward and get this done.

290
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:14,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully it will be something that, you know, can be worked on once the funding is there at the beginning of the year by whoever may sit behind this rail.

291
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:21,029
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's a project that we've all spoken in favor of doing, and it's something that needs to be done.

292
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:24,091
[SPEAKER_09]: So I ask that a portion be set aside.

293
00:22:24,951 --> 00:22:27,993
[SPEAKER_09]: She wants us to research different companies and the costs.

294
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:30,535
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure we are capable of doing that.

295
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:38,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we need a commitment first that yes, we are, the administration's willing to put money aside so that we're able to do this.

296
00:22:40,913 --> 00:22:42,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

297
00:22:42,454 --> 00:22:43,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

298
00:22:43,374 --> 00:22:46,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I thank my colleague for bringing this issue forward.

299
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:59,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that this has been one of the biggest questions as we go street to street and talking to residents and asking questions about our zoning laws and our ordinances.

300
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:09,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that months back, when we first brought this issue up, one of the biggest concerns was the amount of money that a consultant would cost.

301
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,671
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need that consultant.

302
00:23:11,731 --> 00:23:13,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's time that we do that.

303
00:23:13,532 --> 00:23:24,099
[SPEAKER_03]: But as neighboring communities have done, something that I've mentioned here in the past, they've used the Metropolitan Planning Council, that kind of set an agenda that they could follow.

304
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:30,225
[SPEAKER_03]: to look at our changing of zoning laws.

305
00:23:30,306 --> 00:23:53,459
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to call for a meeting with maybe possibly bring in the Metropolitan Planning Council, a subcommittee meeting or a community of the whole meeting to bring that organization in to just to ask them for some guidance in what they've done with other communities that had similar issues that we have here in Medford that some of our zoning and most of our zoning haven't been looked at in over 30 years.

306
00:23:55,319 --> 00:24:07,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I second my colleague's resolve, and I'd like to make an amendment to that, if she doesn't mind, that we call for a meeting with maybe a committee of the whole meeting relatively soon.

307
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:17,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's been a very difficult time for scheduling, but maybe set something up with a consultant from the Metropolitan Planning Council and ask them for some guidance.

308
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:21,418
[SPEAKER_03]: We're already a member of the council, and

309
00:24:22,448 --> 00:24:23,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's free to us.

310
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that might be an avenue that we could research and move forward with.

311
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:30,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I thank, thank council for bringing that forward.

312
00:24:31,453 --> 00:24:32,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

313
00:24:32,734 --> 00:24:34,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

314
00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:38,577
[SPEAKER_07]: This certainly has been a topic that's been brought up before and in previous times when the issue was brought up.

315
00:24:39,297 --> 00:24:44,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, I had a question and the question was, what are we trying to accomplish?

316
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,462
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to, we want to review our zoning laws, but what is it that we want to try to accomplish?

317
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:56,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And that started a conversation, Mr. President, and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinances has met a number of times, more than once, to discuss this very issue, Mr. President.

318
00:24:57,017 --> 00:25:08,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that we've been doing is trying to develop goals and develop criteria for further debate and discussion as to what we feel is what would be important to put Medford in a position to be successful as we grow.

319
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:15,662
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the items that we've been discussing was the ability to ensure that we continue to generate between 1.25 and 1.5 percent new growth annually.

320
00:25:18,328 --> 00:25:28,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Another item that we've been looking upon, Mr. President, is the ability to expand upon commercially zoned parcels to ensure an equitable residential tax rate and an equitable shift of the residential tax burden to the commercial side.

321
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:44,754
[SPEAKER_07]: We've also discussed the possibilities that we have to meet and exceed the state-established thresholds for affordable housing, protecting the neighborhood's integrity and the historical assets in our community, as well as a few things that we're looking into

322
00:25:45,615 --> 00:25:55,781
[SPEAKER_07]: with the technical assistance from the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, with the draft plan to revitalize Medford Square, and soon to be work on the revitalization of Mystic Avenue, Mr. President.

323
00:25:55,821 --> 00:26:01,764
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are a couple of items that are in the works here, and there's been a conversation that's been ongoing on this current topic.

324
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,865
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it was the desire of the subcommittee

325
00:26:04,228 --> 00:26:09,229
[SPEAKER_07]: to establish these criteria, to go through the whole entire process, and then to report the paper out to the council.

326
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:15,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And once we have that paper ready to further debate and deliberate, we can send it to the administration and say, these are the goals we want to accomplish.

327
00:26:16,311 --> 00:26:17,431
[SPEAKER_07]: What's it going to cost to get it done?

328
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:20,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's where we are in the process, Mr. President.

329
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:21,912
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank the council for putting the measure forward.

330
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:22,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a good idea.

331
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: We've done a lot of work on it, and we're going to continue to work on it, and we're going to continue to make this happen.

332
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:39,220
[SPEAKER_11]: impacts the quality of life of all residents throughout our city.

333
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:45,764
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, zoning is one of the biggest responsibilities we have here on the council and zoning hasn't been looked at.

334
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:48,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's close to 50 years and it needs to be looked at.

335
00:26:49,447 --> 00:27:03,136
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, and I, and I, I did offer a paper on this earlier in the term, uh, with regard to, uh, having someone, uh, come in from the outside and take a look at, and you know, that paper did get moved to subcommittee where we have been looking at it and meeting on it.

336
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:04,257
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um,

337
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:09,961
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, but I do think it's important to continue the conversation and make sure that we keep it in the forefront.

338
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:13,364
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, you know, I, I do support the resolution.

339
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:18,929
[SPEAKER_11]: I, I, I'm not sure as far as the next step, if we already have a resolution in subcommittee, what the next step would be.

340
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:20,471
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I do support the resolution.

341
00:27:20,511 --> 00:27:22,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's, it needs to be looked at without a doubt.

342
00:27:23,594 --> 00:27:27,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but, uh, so I do, I do support, uh, both resolutions fully.

343
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:29,416
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

344
00:27:30,497 --> 00:27:31,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

345
00:27:32,718 --> 00:27:36,700
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I first let me say I appreciate the role of the zoning subcommittee.

346
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,421
[SPEAKER_16]: They've done yeoman's work on this particular issue.

347
00:27:39,842 --> 00:27:47,045
[SPEAKER_16]: And as councilor Falco just alluded to, uh, this is something that really has been ignored for a lot of years in this community.

348
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:50,587
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, in my opinion, uh, it's going to merit,

349
00:27:51,510 --> 00:28:00,635
[SPEAKER_16]: to bring in a consultant that handles zoning on a day-to-day and can advise us on what our steps are as a community.

350
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:10,520
[SPEAKER_16]: The only thing I'd state, and I realize this is something that's in subcommittee, is I think this issue is much larger than just a paper before a subcommittee.

351
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,103
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this issue, Mr. President, impacts every walk of life in this community.

352
00:28:16,883 --> 00:28:20,225
[SPEAKER_16]: And as we all know, zoning is the lifeline of a community.

353
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:27,796
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's important while we saw in Cambridge the growth and expansion in Cambridge.

354
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:34,478
[SPEAKER_16]: We're witnessing it now in Somerville, which they probably don't have another piece of land to build on.

355
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:36,658
[SPEAKER_16]: We're experiencing it now in the city.

356
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:38,279
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going through it right now.

357
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:42,680
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we have to react quicker than what we're doing.

358
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,781
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's no reflection on any one particular individual or any particular body in this community.

359
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:49,781
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think we really have to react.

360
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:56,455
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's prudent to bring in a consultant that will sit down with this council and tell us where we begin.

361
00:28:56,795 --> 00:29:01,498
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great to get feedback, and that feedback can continue while this process happens.

362
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:08,708
[SPEAKER_16]: But to sit back and wait for recommendations at this point, you know, the horse is already out of the barn.

363
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,050
[SPEAKER_16]: We're experiencing the growth right now.

364
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,291
[SPEAKER_16]: We're attending the ZBA meetings.

365
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:27,458
[SPEAKER_16]: We're hearing residents stand up and say, I don't want that particular development in my neighborhood based on the lack of parking, based on there's no setback, based on height, based on a number of things, Mr. President, that is concerning.

366
00:29:28,584 --> 00:29:35,369
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, when you look at other communities, they're incorporated right within their zoning ordinances, car share.

367
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:39,052
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe Cambridge and Somerville have a car share program.

368
00:29:39,492 --> 00:29:52,580
[SPEAKER_16]: So when projects come in in thickly settled areas in Cambridge, Somerville, and many other communities, it's part of their zoning that requires car share, which we refer to as the zip cars, Mr. President.

369
00:29:53,560 --> 00:30:03,626
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, there's also solar share that's brought up in many new initiatives now when it comes to residential and commercial building and so forth.

370
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:09,050
[SPEAKER_16]: also calls for a solar share as well as a car share.

371
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:22,522
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's a lot of initiatives that we could include within our zoning ordinances to help alleviate some of the concern that we're hearing, at least I'm hearing from residents when I go to these meetings, about the fact that

372
00:30:23,132 --> 00:30:26,073
[SPEAKER_16]: These projects don't fit the very fabric of the neighborhood.

373
00:30:26,514 --> 00:30:27,854
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's incumbent upon us.

374
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,495
[SPEAKER_16]: We have, I'd say, two major jobs.

375
00:30:31,115 --> 00:30:34,037
[SPEAKER_16]: One set in the city budget, or approved in the city budget.

376
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:37,298
[SPEAKER_16]: And the second one is zoning, in my opinion.

377
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:39,559
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, they go hand in hand.

378
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:48,963
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'd be remiss if we sat back any longer while this city's going to go through a building boom and is experiencing right now

379
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:53,061
[SPEAKER_16]: single families turning into three, four, five units.

380
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:54,782
[SPEAKER_16]: It's happening throughout the community.

381
00:30:55,162 --> 00:31:01,825
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, a lot that was built with a single family home, as we saw in the Lawrence Estates, turns into two giant homes.

382
00:31:02,646 --> 00:31:19,094
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the concerns that I hear from residents, and we have to have a way as a council to say, you know what, we're not Cambridge, we're not Somerville, we want to make sure whatever happens in our community is something that we can all agree upon, and whatever new growth happens, whatever direction we go in,

383
00:31:19,507 --> 00:31:34,235
[SPEAKER_16]: that it's going to be sensible for this community and that people are going to rest assured that when they moved to this community, they moved here for a reason, because of our open space, because of our schools, because of our parks, because of all the natural resources in this community.

384
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:39,437
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't want to lose that very fabric that I think people move to this community for.

385
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:42,459
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I support this whole heartily.

386
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:44,420
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's been offered a number of times by

387
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:52,810
[SPEAKER_16]: other members of the council to bring someone on board, whether it's MPAC or whether it's any other organization or a private consultant.

388
00:31:53,770 --> 00:32:07,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Really, that doesn't matter to me as long as we bring in an expert that can guide us along this very arduous process of really looking through hundreds and hundreds of pages of local zoning that hasn't been reviewed in decades.

389
00:32:07,877 --> 00:32:08,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

390
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:10,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Langlois-Kearns.

391
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll yield to the podium.

392
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:16,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

393
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,009
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

394
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:21,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 281 Park Street.

395
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:31,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that we're talking about zoning, and I hope that we move past talking, but when we look for someone to bring in, we need to make sure that that group is independent and non-biased.

396
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,642
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that the zoning reforms that we make are Medford-centric and benefit Medford.

397
00:32:37,142 --> 00:32:42,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone talked about all the development that's happening in the city, but what I heard was residential, residential, residential.

398
00:32:43,226 --> 00:33:01,739
[SPEAKER_00]: What's different between our development and Somerville and Cambridge's development is that they are very conscious of maintaining a balance of commercial and residential and making sure that they're able to support the infrastructure, the increased needs, the quality of life items that residents require and should have.

399
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:03,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really important.

400
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,962
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to think about that as we move forward.

401
00:33:07,002 --> 00:33:12,266
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't spoke to one single resident that said, I really hope they sell the house next door to me and put up an apartment building.

402
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:19,031
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have people living in homes right now that are in apartment zones that that very thing could happen.

403
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:26,356
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've ever seen a resident who's heard that there's going to be a 12-unit building shading their home, it's very traumatizing.

404
00:33:26,656 --> 00:33:29,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing that we can do because of the way that the zoning is written.

405
00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:33,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, what's happening as we're waiting, this is already happening.

406
00:33:35,155 --> 00:33:41,118
[SPEAKER_00]: developers are coming, they're proposing what they want to do, they're going to the ZBA, they're getting multiple, multiple variances.

407
00:33:41,598 --> 00:33:48,341
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that when you have variances in commercial areas where you add residential, that it can cause problems adding commercial in later.

408
00:33:48,461 --> 00:33:53,844
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a Dog for Days group that couldn't come in because they were abutting an apartment building.

409
00:33:54,604 --> 00:34:01,350
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a meeting about the Wegmans and there were resident concerns about loading dock hours because the residents were there.

410
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:05,214
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very cautious about what happens with Mystic Ave.

411
00:34:05,414 --> 00:34:08,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the first proposal that came out was 500 units.

412
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:16,321
[SPEAKER_00]: of apartments on Mystic Avenue, dead center of nine parcels, which will impact our ability to develop commercially.

413
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:25,646
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to stop being the city where developers believe that they can come in and make their own zoning because we haven't updated the zoning.

414
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:29,647
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just going to change it and do what they want, and we're going to be left running behind.

415
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:30,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

416
00:34:39,302 --> 00:34:46,045
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing I would caution is that we actually have an understanding as to which direction we'd like to take the city as opposed to the zoning.

417
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Advisors coming in and telling us which direction to go.

418
00:34:49,947 --> 00:34:51,568
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason why I say that is because.

419
00:34:52,328 --> 00:35:03,212
[SPEAKER_15]: As any situation, if it's driven by tax and tax base, then you're going to see a lot of conversation about high rises and higher up condominiums.

420
00:35:03,592 --> 00:35:09,114
[SPEAKER_15]: When we're really trying to see what we can do about addressing the downtown areas and trying to keep the characters of those areas.

421
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,686
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are certain areas of the city, I'm sure, that can actually be developed like Mystic Ave, mixed use, whatever it is that we want to do.

422
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:21,412
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have to have an understanding as a city in itself before this advisor comes in.

423
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:25,777
[SPEAKER_15]: And we really should be able to tell them which direction we'd like the city to go.

424
00:35:26,217 --> 00:35:33,505
[SPEAKER_15]: and how do we get there as opposed to them telling us we think this is the way the city should go and this is how it's going to increase your tax base and this is what it's going to do to the city.

425
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:47,880
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the one big thing that I would caution everyone to, you know, come together, figure out which direction the city should take and which direction it should go with all the five downtowns, with all the areas that we feel we can develop, whether it should be

426
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,762
[SPEAKER_15]: strictly high-rise or it should be mixed-use.

427
00:35:51,602 --> 00:36:00,327
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe that, you know, we've got to address the middle class and what we can do about affordability and housing in the respect to that, not just low income as far as well.

428
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:07,332
[SPEAKER_15]: So those issues are something that we need to go to the table with and making sure that we understand this is the direction we want Medford to go.

429
00:36:07,632 --> 00:36:08,312
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we get there?

430
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:08,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

431
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:09,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

432
00:36:11,654 --> 00:36:12,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

433
00:36:12,055 --> 00:36:13,055
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

434
00:36:13,115 --> 00:36:15,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Joyce Paul, 8 Mason street.

435
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:29,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the last city council meeting and, um, I went to the CPA meeting Wednesday and Michael Marks, counselor marks had brought up three things that I thought were very basic.

436
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:41,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And he talked about the basics, the roads, the sidewalks, and getting a crossing, not guard, but a crossing thing that doesn't disappear in six months.

437
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:44,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a very big basic.

438
00:36:45,055 --> 00:36:50,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I went to the CPA meeting, I asked them, you know, they say, well, we can't do this and that.

439
00:36:50,217 --> 00:36:53,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I understand that you can't do this and you can't do that.

440
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:59,582
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there's any way you could do any of the basic things that we need, it makes more sense

441
00:37:00,078 --> 00:37:06,259
[SPEAKER_02]: than coming up with something that maybe we don't really need, or at least we don't need before the basics.

442
00:37:06,759 --> 00:37:09,120
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether they will do it or not, I don't know.

443
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,500
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did bring it up.

444
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:24,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the housing, and I'm very, very concerned about the housing, a few years ago I tried to help someone get senior housing, and it was impossible.

445
00:37:24,402 --> 00:37:27,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to the person who was the head of senior housing,

446
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:39,422
[SPEAKER_02]: and they had gotten about a four unit housing for grandparents who had custody of their children because the children were sick.

447
00:37:39,863 --> 00:37:44,825
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a woman and she had multiple sclerosis and she gave custody to her

448
00:37:46,328 --> 00:37:47,329
[SPEAKER_02]: her mother and father.

449
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:57,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And I read there was an article in the Globe about the fact that because of the opioid crisis, there are so many more grandparents having custody of their children.

450
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:00,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, we have to do something for housing.

451
00:38:01,436 --> 00:38:05,518
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do that, and it would be a small development.

452
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:08,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be something that we would need.

453
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wouldn't bring in all the problems that

454
00:38:13,505 --> 00:38:14,966
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that that would be.

455
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:30,957
[SPEAKER_02]: So I brought some of the, unfortunately I can't go Saturday, but I hope you will go Saturday or at least get out there your opinion that we need the basics and we need limited housing, but maybe housing for seniors.

456
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:33,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to leave some of these over there.

457
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:37,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't go Saturday, maybe you could fill one of these out and,

458
00:38:38,564 --> 00:38:39,945
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, drop it off all sorts.

459
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:41,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

460
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:43,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are really good.

461
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:46,368
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you can stand listening to all of us all the time.

462
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:47,148
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

463
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:50,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

464
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:54,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

465
00:38:54,172 --> 00:38:57,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Castanetti, Cushman Street, Mefford, Massachusetts.

466
00:39:01,315 --> 00:39:03,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Speak back to the mystic of zoning.

467
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to add some input.

468
00:39:06,399 --> 00:39:08,920
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived on Mystic Ave in 1955.

469
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:15,501
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the old highways of Boston before they built Route 93 in 1960, I believe.

470
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:28,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 1965, I came up with an idea, although I didn't have much in numbers of age or power.

471
00:39:31,461 --> 00:39:46,650
[SPEAKER_01]: The city, in my opinion, should have taken all of Mr. Gav on the east side by Eminent Domain at that time when we had the muscle and it was more affordable, even with a duty 21E at the junkyard, presumably.

472
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:53,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd have the developers go up whatever, 25, 35 stories high.

473
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:01,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you worked here, you'd be at work now.

474
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:04,277
[SPEAKER_01]: Marshall Sloan took the idea 10 years ago with his billboard.

475
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:11,620
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that never happened, and Mr. Gabb is underutilized.

476
00:40:12,681 --> 00:40:19,064
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be a goldmine if it was in New York City, or even for five miles north of Boston, which it is.

477
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:24,747
[SPEAKER_01]: However, first of all, this new growth, real estate tax,

478
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:33,146
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow is wonderful because without growth, we start to go backwards.

479
00:40:33,987 --> 00:40:45,953
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when the new growth, when you don't use the new real estate taxes to offset prop two and a half increases, it doesn't help us who have been carrying the weight and paying real estate taxes for all these decades.

480
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:56,478
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually hurts us infinitely because we need more police, more fire, school, buildings, pensions, infrastructure.

481
00:40:57,614 --> 00:41:03,656
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, in the following year, they add 2.5% to a larger inflated number.

482
00:41:04,616 --> 00:41:11,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have put a ring road on Mr. Gav, keep him off Main Street, unless they wanted to go to the Pasquales in those days.

483
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:20,101
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, good luck with this new zoning, because it should have been done a long, long time ago.

484
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:24,202
[SPEAKER_01]: But I must reiterate, the new growth does not help us.

485
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,603
[SPEAKER_01]: It hurts us infinitely.

486
00:41:27,058 --> 00:41:27,758
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.

487
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:28,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

488
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:29,680
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Longo-Kurin.

489
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Carviello.

490
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:42,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank the speakers and I know that a few of many that are interested in this topic in the city with all the development that has gone on and will continue to go on.

491
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:49,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I think part of what I asked for a development committee and task forces is so that we can get more community input.

492
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:53,414
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think Mr. McKillop had a good point and I

493
00:41:54,078 --> 00:42:11,185
[SPEAKER_09]: That is that the seven of us need to sit down, and I agree with maybe that's a place to start, but we need to do it sooner rather than later with regards to meeting with the Metropolitan Planning Council, and then maybe they can guide us on which company that needs to be hired and the pricing that it will cost.

494
00:42:11,546 --> 00:42:15,667
[SPEAKER_09]: But it needs to be the seven of us, and it needs to happen much sooner than it has.

495
00:42:16,168 --> 00:42:23,891
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank the subcommittee for doing the work they've done so far, but I think now it's the seven of us and the committee of the whole that need to take

496
00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:32,359
[SPEAKER_09]: the ball by the horns and get this process started, because time cannot tick away on such an important issue.

497
00:42:32,379 --> 00:42:42,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And it is the seven of us that hear from residents on a daily basis, whether they're for development, against development, for a certain amount of units versus more commercial.

498
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:49,214
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we know what we want, and I think we can tell, no problem tell the Metropolitan Planning Council

499
00:42:50,262 --> 00:42:52,704
[SPEAKER_09]: where we want to go and how we how we want to get it done.

500
00:42:52,764 --> 00:42:56,427
[SPEAKER_09]: We just need some guidance and we need to start the process sooner than later.

501
00:42:57,227 --> 00:42:57,608
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

502
00:42:58,168 --> 00:43:02,551
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

503
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:03,231
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

504
00:43:03,592 --> 00:43:03,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

505
00:43:04,392 --> 00:43:05,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Plus the amendment.

506
00:43:06,914 --> 00:43:08,675
[SPEAKER_17]: As amended by Councilor Scott Pelley.

507
00:43:10,557 --> 00:43:13,258
[SPEAKER_17]: With the master.

508
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,020
[SPEAKER_17]: As amended by Councilor Scott Pelley.

509
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:16,721
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

510
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:17,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

511
00:43:17,401 --> 00:43:18,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

512
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:41,002
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-687 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the DPW report back to the Council when the replacement of asphalt concrete panels will be performed, and be it further resolved, an inventory of asphalt street panels be forwarded to the Council, including the address where it's located and the date the concrete was initially removed.

513
00:43:41,562 --> 00:43:42,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

514
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:43,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

515
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:47,206
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a number of areas throughout the community that have had

516
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:53,123
[SPEAKER_07]: asphalt patchwork performed on cracking sidewalks, concrete sidewalks that have been removed.

517
00:43:53,343 --> 00:44:13,068
[SPEAKER_07]: And the theory behind it would be that we put a temporary patch down of asphalt sidewalk, and then when we have enough locations in the community that are in a certain area or region, we call the concrete truck up, and we get the concrete truck out there, and we break down these asphalt sidewalk patches, and we put concrete patches down, Mr. President.

518
00:44:13,788 --> 00:44:24,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that enough time has passed now, but we do have enough locations across the city of Medford that could require one, two, maybe ten concrete trucks to get out there and start pouring concrete sidewalks, Mr. President.

519
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,091
[SPEAKER_07]: We look at the Regency and the Rio Condominium buildings right on Winthrop Street.

520
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:37,612
[SPEAKER_07]: For two and a half years, they sat there and they had a gigantic drainage project performed right beside their house.

521
00:44:38,232 --> 00:44:41,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Their sidewalk was taken down, replaced with an asphalt sidewalk.

522
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:42,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Two years have gone by.

523
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:44,826
[SPEAKER_07]: The concrete sidewalk has not been replaced.

524
00:44:45,806 --> 00:44:56,751
[SPEAKER_07]: You go up to Ashcroft Road, Mr. President, and you'll see in front of 129 a tree being removed, the stump being ground down, the sidewalk being replaced with asphalt.

525
00:44:57,191 --> 00:44:58,531
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, with asphalt and concrete.

526
00:44:58,551 --> 00:44:59,452
[SPEAKER_07]: It still hasn't happened.

527
00:44:59,472 --> 00:45:00,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Two years have gone by.

528
00:45:00,712 --> 00:45:06,455
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's time, Mr. President, that we make a focus on this really basic city service and this real quality of life issue.

529
00:45:06,515 --> 00:45:07,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a curb appeal issue.

530
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:15,095
[SPEAKER_07]: When you look out the window of your vehicle when you're driving down the street, we like to see concrete sidewalks, not a patchwork of concrete and asphalt, Mr. President.

531
00:45:15,636 --> 00:45:19,719
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm asking the DPW to report back to the Council the following information.

532
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:36,011
[SPEAKER_07]: That is, when the replacement of the asphalt to concrete panels will be performed, and an inventory of those street panels, as well as when the concrete was initially removed, so that we have a better idea as to how long this has been going on, and we can get a better understanding, Mr. President, as to how many street panels

533
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,741
[SPEAKER_07]: how many panels it takes before we call a concrete truck out.

534
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,162
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I move for approval of resolution.

535
00:45:45,282 --> 00:45:46,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor DelaRusso.

536
00:45:46,563 --> 00:45:47,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

537
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,284
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad this issue was brought up.

538
00:45:49,364 --> 00:45:53,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been contacted and stopped by a number of residents regarding this very issue.

539
00:45:54,325 --> 00:46:00,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, we only have a couple of weeks before concrete pouring has to stop.

540
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:02,168
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's pour, pour, pour.

541
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:03,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

542
00:46:05,629 --> 00:46:06,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

543
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:10,559
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Ray scarf on nine sunset Ave.

544
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:13,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank council tonight for bringing this forward.

545
00:46:14,161 --> 00:46:18,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, this morning I had shown a picture to the council president about 39 sunset Ave.

546
00:46:19,405 --> 00:46:24,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's approximately about 50 feet of frontage and the whole sidewalk's been taken up.

547
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:26,229
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going on four months now.

548
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:32,333
[SPEAKER_14]: They totally framed it in and they haven't come back to, uh, pour the, uh, the cement.

549
00:46:32,714 --> 00:46:37,537
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also a couple of, um, panels on the other side of the street that haven't been done as well.

550
00:46:39,002 --> 00:46:42,946
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a walk through to Tufts University up towards College Ave.

551
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,527
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people use that route.

552
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:53,415
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is they could walk out in the street, but they have about 10 yards of gravel at the end of the street that butt up against the sidewalk as well.

553
00:46:56,978 --> 00:47:05,926
[SPEAKER_14]: The people in the area, well, they're concerned because now we're getting, like Councilor De La Russo says, we only got a couple of weeks left before we can start pouring cement.

554
00:47:06,482 --> 00:47:09,863
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're concerned about people gonna get hurt walking through.

555
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:15,505
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, it's a danger because a lot of leaves now are inside that pit.

556
00:47:16,325 --> 00:47:21,207
[SPEAKER_14]: The pipes are sticking up where shutoffs for water, gas, or whatever on that sidewalk.

557
00:47:21,227 --> 00:47:22,488
[SPEAKER_14]: So people can't see.

558
00:47:22,668 --> 00:47:26,949
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they start to walk in through the pit, somebody's gonna trip and fall.

559
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:31,831
[SPEAKER_14]: The homeowner at 39 is called numerous times to City Hall

560
00:47:32,531 --> 00:47:38,054
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, I think there was a contractor involved and has totally either disappeared or whatever.

561
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:47,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so I would strongly recommend that, uh, the council send a letter to whomever to get this taken care of.

562
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:50,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I did read that to the attention to Mr. Cairns this morning.

563
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:50,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

564
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:53,461
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, hopefully you'll have an answer for me by, uh, by tomorrow morning.

565
00:47:53,501 --> 00:47:56,483
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it because, um, uh, the, the, uh,

566
00:47:57,596 --> 00:48:02,278
[SPEAKER_14]: people, homeowners on the street are getting up in arms and they're ready to come up here full tilt.

567
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:06,139
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you can get back to me as soon as possible, I'll stop tomorrow.

568
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll stop the rush.

569
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,321
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Falco.

570
00:48:09,641 --> 00:48:10,421
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

571
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:10,901
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

572
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:13,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor Knight for bringing this forward.

573
00:48:13,482 --> 00:48:20,485
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an important public safety issue, especially if you don't have sidewalks, you're forcing people into the street and you're forcing kids into the street.

574
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:21,826
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes that becomes an issue.

575
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:25,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, over the last two weeks, this has come up as an issue where,

576
00:48:25,504 --> 00:48:34,109
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had sidewalks that need to be replaced, and we've asked for lists the last few weeks, and a list should take literally a few minutes to produce.

577
00:48:34,129 --> 00:48:35,090
[SPEAKER_11]: You just have to print it out.

578
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:46,857
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you could please, if we could just amend it to get an updated list with regard to the sidewalks that need to be replaced, and how many have been replaced so far, and how many stumps have been removed.

579
00:48:46,877 --> 00:48:48,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this is stuff that we have requested

580
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:54,414
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the last three meetings now we've requested this and we still have no information.

581
00:48:54,454 --> 00:48:57,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could please, uh, just add that amendment to the resolution.

582
00:48:57,856 --> 00:48:58,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

583
00:48:58,717 --> 00:48:59,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

584
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:10,827
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was this council who was asked several times for the city to put on a cement crew that should be working nine months a year because we certainly have enough sidewalks to keep us cement crew busy all the time.

585
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:16,912
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by councilor night, second and by council,

586
00:49:17,628 --> 00:49:17,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

587
00:49:18,368 --> 00:49:25,672
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to be clear, Councilor Falco, what are you looking for for a time frame on those lists from when we appropriated that large portion of money?

588
00:49:29,253 --> 00:49:33,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure we're clear so we get exactly what we want.

589
00:49:33,735 --> 00:49:35,276
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.

590
00:49:35,296 --> 00:49:35,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

591
00:49:36,116 --> 00:49:39,518
[SPEAKER_11]: We appropriated money, I believe, in the spring for this and quite a bit

592
00:49:40,914 --> 00:49:41,554
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, money.

593
00:49:41,855 --> 00:50:02,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so if we could find just basically find out, I'd like to see what progress they've made from the list that we were given in the spring, what progress they've made to date, uh, because there were quite a few sidewalks and stumps that needed to be removed and sidewalk panels that needed to be replaced and asphalt sidewalks that some parts of the city actually have asphalt sidewalk.

594
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:02,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh,

595
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:04,590
[SPEAKER_11]: those needed to be replaced as well.

596
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:10,913
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, it'd be good to see what kind of progress they've made, how much money they've spent so far, how much is remaining.

597
00:50:11,494 --> 00:50:19,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, like it was, like, uh, we said earlier, I mean, the season is, you know, dwindling away to, uh, to pour concrete.

598
00:50:20,299 --> 00:50:25,161
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd really like to see you get an update as to what his, uh, you know, what their progress has been so far.

599
00:50:26,502 --> 00:50:27,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor Knight.

600
00:50:27,463 --> 00:50:30,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with the paper being amended.

601
00:50:30,284 --> 00:50:31,485
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I'd ask you to be, um,

602
00:50:32,002 --> 00:50:33,802
[SPEAKER_07]: placed forward in the form of a B paper.

603
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:37,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I want a complete inventory of all the asphalt street panels in the city.

604
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:51,547
[SPEAKER_07]: My concern isn't whether or not the funds that we appropriated earlier in the year, I believe it was $300,000 to take down some stumps and replace some sidewalks that were damaged during water service work, if I'm not mistaken, were done.

605
00:50:51,727 --> 00:50:53,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want to keep them separate, Mr. President.

606
00:50:53,787 --> 00:50:57,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I certainly support Councillor Falco's amendments to the paper.

607
00:50:57,872 --> 00:51:02,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I just would like to see them in a B paper so that the administration doesn't confuse the two issues and only give us one report.

608
00:51:03,274 --> 00:51:04,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Mox.

609
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:06,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you Mr. President.

610
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:13,757
[SPEAKER_16]: This council has called for an audit of our streets and our sidewalks for the past several years.

611
00:51:14,512 --> 00:51:20,678
[SPEAKER_16]: uh, to date, uh, we have received, uh, no correspondence from the city administration regarding either.

612
00:51:21,319 --> 00:51:36,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, we talk about this and we've been talking about it for years, this sidewalk list, like it's some secretive list that's in a vault somewhere that no one can view, but it's out there and residents aren't sure if they're on the sidewalk list.

613
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,095
[SPEAKER_16]: They've been told they are.

614
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:47,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, why can't we have a list that's on the city website that's updated, that shows you what's being worked on, the progress?

615
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:56,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Why does it have to be this secretive list that we have to beg for to get a copy to see if things are actually working in this community?

616
00:51:57,808 --> 00:52:00,150
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no transparency at all.

617
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,032
[SPEAKER_16]: And this has been the way

618
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:14,474
[SPEAKER_16]: And actually, in the past, Mr. President, I've actually voted against requests because I've asked, you know, DPW directors, can you show us what you want to spend this money on?

619
00:52:14,874 --> 00:52:16,015
[SPEAKER_16]: How many sidewalks?

620
00:52:16,315 --> 00:52:17,175
[SPEAKER_16]: How many stumps?

621
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:19,296
[SPEAKER_16]: And we couldn't get any answers.

622
00:52:20,077 --> 00:52:29,000
[SPEAKER_16]: And today, we're still continuing with the same format where, you know, you'll have a resident that calls you up and says, I've been told by City Hall I'm on the list.

623
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:32,502
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll tell them, well, there's multiple lists.

624
00:52:32,892 --> 00:52:36,973
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what list you're on, but, uh, you may or may not be on a list.

625
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:39,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, it's just too confusing for residents.

626
00:52:40,055 --> 00:52:41,515
[SPEAKER_16]: It's confusing for this council.

627
00:52:41,915 --> 00:52:48,218
[SPEAKER_16]: I would ask if you want to do a C paper or D paper that, uh, this be put on the city website.

628
00:52:48,638 --> 00:52:52,179
[SPEAKER_16]: So a resident can go on Mr. President and look and say, yes,

629
00:52:53,223 --> 00:52:54,904
[SPEAKER_16]: 32 High Street is on the list.

630
00:52:55,244 --> 00:53:02,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, it was called in on February 2nd, they plan on getting it to October 3rd, and this is the status, it was closed out.

631
00:53:03,746 --> 00:53:11,128
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems to me a simple request to track, and by leaving it open-ended, no one knows in this community what's going on.

632
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:19,630
[SPEAKER_16]: No one knows if their sidewalk's gonna get done, they don't really know if they're on the list or not, and until we do a complete audit,

633
00:53:20,792 --> 00:53:26,657
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a couple of things on the resolution for this afternoon, and I know Councilor Falco does also.

634
00:53:27,858 --> 00:53:31,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I was on Bowen Ave to see one particular sidewalk.

635
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:40,488
[SPEAKER_16]: And honestly, an hour later, I viewed 25 different sidewalks because residents kept on coming out and said, hey, look at this sidewalk.

636
00:53:40,668 --> 00:53:42,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, look, I'm supposed to be on the list.

637
00:53:42,269 --> 00:53:44,011
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, look, they dug this up five months ago.

638
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:44,791
[SPEAKER_16]: They never came back.

639
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:46,653
[SPEAKER_16]: All they put was orange cones out here.

640
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:49,195
[SPEAKER_16]: And literally, that's a microcosm

641
00:53:49,845 --> 00:53:52,867
[SPEAKER_16]: that one street on what's happening in this community.

642
00:53:54,308 --> 00:53:56,269
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on every street, Mr. President.

643
00:53:56,729 --> 00:54:06,935
[SPEAKER_16]: And until we do a complete audit and come out with one list that's publicized on the city website or on local cable, or wherever you want to put it, we're never going to get a handle on this issue.

644
00:54:07,735 --> 00:54:09,416
[SPEAKER_16]: We're never going to get a handle, Mr. President.

645
00:54:09,696 --> 00:54:10,017
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

646
00:54:10,037 --> 00:54:13,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to make that in the motion of a seat paper, Councilor Maxwell?

647
00:54:13,259 --> 00:54:15,320
[SPEAKER_16]: If he wants to make it a seat paper or part of his paper.

648
00:54:17,665 --> 00:54:19,365
[SPEAKER_17]: For the purchase, I will make that a C paper.

649
00:54:19,405 --> 00:54:20,546
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

650
00:54:25,527 --> 00:54:26,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record.

651
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:31,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Please make scaffold nine cents at F. Um, there's, there's so many out there.

652
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:44,472
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I drive to city every day because my business is in the city and between the stumps and the sidewalks and the streets and everything that the problem is, is that we only have five DPW highway department workers can't expect them to do everything.

653
00:54:44,922 --> 00:54:49,024
[SPEAKER_14]: You got contractors out there, they come, they go, they disappear, whatever the situation may be.

654
00:54:49,585 --> 00:55:02,451
[SPEAKER_14]: It's time to start to think about hiring some more DPW workers so we can have multiple crews out there doing different things, which will be stumps, sidewalks, potholes, whatever needs to be done.

655
00:55:02,471 --> 00:55:07,454
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have multiple crews doing different things, this will start to move forward and we'll start to get a lot of this cleaned up.

656
00:55:08,094 --> 00:55:08,295
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

657
00:55:08,315 --> 00:55:08,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

658
00:55:11,396 --> 00:55:12,457
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

659
00:55:13,896 --> 00:55:15,678
[SPEAKER_15]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

660
00:55:16,158 --> 00:55:19,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I didn't get a chance to say it before, but it's nice to see your houses all done over.

661
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:20,802
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very good.

662
00:55:20,902 --> 00:55:23,084
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you are.

663
00:55:23,924 --> 00:55:26,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's the city's house.

664
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:28,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, as far as the, um,

665
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:41,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Sidewalks, I too have experienced several areas where people are just truly completely frustrated and fed up with the whole process of why they can't get anything completed in this city.

666
00:55:42,518 --> 00:55:49,223
[SPEAKER_15]: My fear right now is the ADA compliance on some of these sidewalks is horrific.

667
00:55:49,463 --> 00:55:50,624
[SPEAKER_15]: It's dangerous.

668
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:56,208
[SPEAKER_15]: I've seen wheelchairs literally go out on the street because they cannot pass on the sidewalks on some of the sidewalks that we have.

669
00:55:57,668 --> 00:56:00,869
[SPEAKER_15]: and the elderly, and the darkness at night.

670
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:07,231
[SPEAKER_15]: When a sidewalk is raised six to eight inches above where it normally should be and someone is walking down the street and it's dark, you can't see.

671
00:56:07,691 --> 00:56:22,834
[SPEAKER_15]: So first things first, there is a company out there, and I can find the name of the company that will actually come in in an emergency situation and shave down the sidewalk so at the very least, until these things are fixed, we can shave the issues that we have so they'll be less likely to trip over them.

672
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,975
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's take some sort of action

673
00:56:25,755 --> 00:56:36,043
[SPEAKER_15]: even if it's just something that's temporary and letting the people know that show us where the worst situation is and we can solve that for you by at least shaving the sidewalks down so no one can trip.

674
00:56:36,383 --> 00:56:37,484
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's start there.

675
00:56:37,905 --> 00:56:48,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Then secondly, this complete streets project kind of really should change the name because in my eyes it's not very complete if we can't add the issues that we currently have in the city

676
00:56:48,953 --> 00:56:56,078
[SPEAKER_15]: to the situation of the corners of every square and some of the sidewalks and some of the ADA.

677
00:56:56,378 --> 00:57:01,242
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're making the entrances onto the sidewalks ADA compliant, we should make the sidewalks ADA compliant.

678
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:03,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Enough is enough, we've got to fix this.

679
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:03,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

680
00:57:03,944 --> 00:57:06,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

681
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:10,408
[SPEAKER_13]: George Sacco, 21 Ridgeway Road, Bedford.

682
00:57:11,569 --> 00:57:16,432
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to pick up what Councilor Box was talking about.

683
00:57:18,588 --> 00:57:25,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, we do a budget on a yearly basis on street repairs, sidewalk repairs, X amount of money is allocated.

684
00:57:27,773 --> 00:57:28,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a little story.

685
00:57:28,614 --> 00:57:33,417
[SPEAKER_13]: I was in my backyard with my grandchildren and my daughter-in-law and my son.

686
00:57:34,337 --> 00:57:38,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And my daughter-in-law happened to be on her little iPhone.

687
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:45,744
[SPEAKER_13]: And she said, hey, Brian, I just got a text from the city of Salem, Salem, New Hampshire.

688
00:57:47,337 --> 00:57:49,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And my son said, well, what's it about?

689
00:57:50,619 --> 00:57:54,682
[SPEAKER_13]: Gee whiz, they're going to do our street, complete street, in 2020.

690
00:57:55,022 --> 00:58:02,006
[SPEAKER_13]: And here I am thinking, Bedford, 58,000 people.

691
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:05,729
[SPEAKER_13]: We do it on a yearly basis.

692
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:10,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Salem, New Hampshire, they do it on a three-year basis.

693
00:58:11,433 --> 00:58:14,915
[SPEAKER_13]: So what they do is they go out, they prorate, they go out three years.

694
00:58:16,523 --> 00:58:21,945
[SPEAKER_13]: We know, the engineering department, they know three years out what street has to be done.

695
00:58:22,505 --> 00:58:24,866
[SPEAKER_13]: They know three years out what sidewalks have to be done.

696
00:58:25,847 --> 00:58:33,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, going out three years, you look down the road and you say, OK, we'll take my street, my old street, Sherwood Road.

697
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:36,651
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to do Sherwood Road in 2020.

698
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:40,933
[SPEAKER_13]: The utilities know they're going to do it in 2020.

699
00:58:41,453 --> 00:58:43,054
[SPEAKER_13]: The water department knows they're going to do it in 2020.

700
00:58:43,094 --> 00:58:43,374
[SPEAKER_13]: They plan.

701
00:58:46,378 --> 00:58:48,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, we've got to put water pipes in, we've got to put hydrants in.

702
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:50,980
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all planned ahead.

703
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Estimated costs can be planned ahead, even though it's not budgeted, but it can be all planned ahead.

704
00:58:57,763 --> 00:58:59,724
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe we ought to look at a three-year plan.

705
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:07,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Go out three years, we do a yearly budget, 2017, we move it out to 2021.

706
00:59:09,428 --> 00:59:10,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Just keep moving it that way.

707
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:15,171
[SPEAKER_13]: And this way here, the residents know, you publish it, you publish it on the internet,

708
00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:22,172
[SPEAKER_13]: You publish it in the local newspaper, so the people know three years from now that they have a shot at having this meeting.

709
00:59:22,953 --> 00:59:24,033
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just a suggestion.

710
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:25,474
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate your time.

711
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:25,974
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

713
00:59:43,301 --> 00:59:43,961
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

714
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:54,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Maxwell?

715
00:59:54,227 --> 00:59:54,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

716
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:55,287
[SPEAKER_17]: The chair was in doubt.

717
00:59:59,168 --> 01:00:00,009
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a roll call.

718
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:03,990
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

719
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:09,612
[SPEAKER_17]: On the B paper offered by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight.

720
01:00:09,832 --> 01:00:10,412
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

721
01:00:11,532 --> 01:00:11,613

725
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:25,844
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-688, offered by Councilor Langlois-Kearns.

726
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:37,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the administration give a written update with regards to the Riverside Plaza project, including a detailed breakdown of how the monies have been spent thus far and what remains to be funded.

01:00:37,828 --> 01:00:38,789
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

728
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:40,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Carviello.

729
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:42,590
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is pretty self-explanatory.

730
01:00:42,731 --> 01:00:51,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking for a breakdown from Office of Community Development on what monies have been expended thus far and how much more we have to go.

731
01:00:51,855 --> 01:01:06,963
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there was somewhat of an update that we had to read about in the transcript, but if the council can be given a detailed breakdown, that would be much appreciated because it sparked follow-up calls from residents to us of why is this project potentially going over?

732
01:01:07,939 --> 01:01:09,301
[SPEAKER_09]: and we really weren't notified.

733
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:11,143
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to learn about it in the paper.

734
01:01:11,503 --> 01:01:11,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

735
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,684

738
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:17,989

01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:20,892

743
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,831
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

744
01:01:32,871 --> 01:01:39,758
[SPEAKER_16]: This sidewalk requires attention by the city and I would ask that it be reviewed and replaced in the interest of public safety.

745
01:01:40,278 --> 01:01:43,101
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight.

746
01:01:43,141 --> 01:01:43,682

751
01:01:58,808 --> 01:02:01,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Very similar to the situation that Councilor Mox just spoke of.

752
01:02:01,449 --> 01:02:07,152
[SPEAKER_07]: This sidewalk panel on the corner of Sherwood Road and Governors Avenue was broken down and it was replaced with gravel.

753
01:02:07,532 --> 01:02:08,452
[SPEAKER_07]: And the gravel remains.

754
01:02:08,512 --> 01:02:09,933
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no smooth surface there.

755
01:02:10,414 --> 01:02:12,115
[SPEAKER_07]: As leaps fall, it becomes a trip hazard.

756
01:02:12,435 --> 01:02:13,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Move for approval, Mr. President.

757
01:02:13,836 --> 01:02:16,998

772
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:14,673
[SPEAKER_11]: We just want to congratulate Duncan McLean for this significant achievement.

773
01:03:15,113 --> 01:03:17,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, he became recently watching this week.

774
01:03:17,334 --> 01:03:20,016
[SPEAKER_11]: He'll be coming, uh, officially becoming Eagle Scout.

775
01:03:20,456 --> 01:03:25,359
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, it's, uh, it's really remarkable to, uh, go through the whole process.

776
01:03:25,819 --> 01:03:29,201
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, during that rank, I believe, uh, the statistic is only 4%,

777
01:03:30,735 --> 01:03:39,724
[SPEAKER_11]: of young men that actually get to that point where they go all the way through the program and become an Eagle Scout.

778
01:03:39,945 --> 01:03:42,107
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really a remarkable achievement.

779
01:03:42,747 --> 01:03:43,728
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a great kid.

780
01:03:43,849 --> 01:03:44,950
[SPEAKER_11]: He's in college now.

781
01:03:46,451 --> 01:03:49,114
[SPEAKER_11]: His service project was to basically, I believe it was

782
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:52,391
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, improving the landscaping down at the Otis street church.

783
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:57,692
[SPEAKER_11]: And it actually did a lot of, uh, structural work to prevent the, uh, foundation from flooding as well.

784
01:03:57,992 --> 01:03:59,772
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, he did a great job.

785
01:04:00,052 --> 01:04:03,073
[SPEAKER_11]: I went down there and visited him during the project.

786
01:04:03,713 --> 01:04:07,313
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, unfortunately that day was pouring out, it was raining.

787
01:04:07,333 --> 01:04:16,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, but really he and his, uh, uh, fellow, uh, troop worked through it and really did a great job of really, uh, upgrading the, uh,

788
01:04:16,565 --> 01:04:19,708
[SPEAKER_11]: the grounds and they did a nice job with the foundation work as well.

789
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:23,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so I just wanted to, uh, congratulate him on the, uh, this achievement.

790
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:28,856
[SPEAKER_11]: And of course, if we could have him come down to, uh, receive a council of common kind of nation, that'd be great.

791
01:04:29,137 --> 01:04:29,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

792
01:04:29,557 --> 01:04:30,418
[SPEAKER_17]: Outstanding young man.

793
01:04:30,478 --> 01:04:31,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice president mocks.

794
01:04:31,919 --> 01:04:33,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

795
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:36,804
[SPEAKER_16]: As counselor Falco just alluded to, um, you know,

796
01:04:37,524 --> 01:04:45,650
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what it is in the water in the city of method here, but, uh, we are turning out, uh, Eagle scouts, uh, uh, real great rate in this community.

797
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:53,335
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, the Otis street church needs to be commended, uh, because a lot of the Eagle scouts are coming from that particular, uh, pack.

798
01:04:54,056 --> 01:05:02,342
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, uh, Duncan, uh, has done yeoman's work as John just alluded to, uh, about doing some landscaping and foundation work.

799
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:05,317
[SPEAKER_16]: around the church itself as a community project.

800
01:05:06,058 --> 01:05:15,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Last Saturday, Mr. President, I had the opportunity to go around with another young gentleman, John Fee, in this community who was going for his Eagle Scout badge.

801
01:05:16,325 --> 01:05:29,996
[SPEAKER_16]: And his community project was to have made up hydrant markers, 100 hydrant markers that he personally installed with his other Cub Scouts.

802
01:05:32,448 --> 01:05:36,631
[SPEAKER_16]: He went around and he went to the vocational school and had them made up.

803
01:05:36,972 --> 01:05:37,712
[SPEAKER_16]: They painted them.

804
01:05:37,972 --> 01:05:38,793
[SPEAKER_16]: They installed them.

805
01:05:39,313 --> 01:05:41,935
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a real good community service project.

806
01:05:42,516 --> 01:05:45,438
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, in this day and age with all that's going on.

807
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:58,290
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice to hear the positive stories that are happening, in particular with young people in our community that are getting involved and seeing the importance of community building and helping the community.

808
01:05:58,350 --> 01:06:04,253
[SPEAKER_16]: So I want to congratulate Duncan, and I hope John Fee, with his project, moves forward.

809
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:06,133
[SPEAKER_16]: And we'll be seeing him shortly, too, Mr. President.

810
01:06:06,153 --> 01:06:07,694
[SPEAKER_17]: The President Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

811
01:06:08,254 --> 01:06:14,357
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we can get them up here soon to get a citation and congratulations to the council, I'd be greatly appreciative.

812
01:06:15,197 --> 01:06:18,439
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Marks and Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

01:06:31,108 --> 01:06:31,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

816
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

817
01:06:35,611 --> 01:06:36,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Rose, happy birthday.

818
01:06:37,312 --> 01:06:40,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like my council colleagues to join me in wishing Mr. DeLuca a happy birthday.

819
01:06:40,835 --> 01:06:44,217
[SPEAKER_07]: 90's a milestone, Mr. President, and I wish her another 90 happy and healthy years.

820
01:06:44,738 --> 01:06:45,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

821
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:50,923
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococo, all those in favor.

822
01:06:51,884 --> 01:06:55,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

823
01:06:55,167 --> 01:07:06,377
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-697 offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the City of Medford has recently removed many of the outdated fire call boxes located throughout the city, be it resolved that the City of Medford Electrical Department remove

824
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:14,082
[SPEAKER_17]: The remaining base of the firebox that still remains in front of 201 Main Street in the interest of public safety.

825
01:07:14,182 --> 01:07:15,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falco.

826
01:07:15,262 --> 01:07:16,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

827
01:07:16,163 --> 01:07:17,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Actually, it's 201 Salem Street.

828
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:17,823
[SPEAKER_11]: 201 Salem Street.

829
01:07:18,403 --> 01:07:21,544
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right in front of Brookline Bank on Salem Street.

830
01:07:22,284 --> 01:07:31,967
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a number of calls on this and sometimes if I get off the bus when I'm coming out of town on Salem Street, you know, actually the bus drops you off.

831
01:07:32,007 --> 01:07:32,907
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right there on the ground.

832
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:36,148
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's actually where the old fire call box used to be.

833
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:48,011
[SPEAKER_11]: It took the call boxes out, but there's like a small pipe that's sticking up and there was some wires that were in the pipe that had been cut, but it's definitely a trip hazard to anybody that's walking through there.

834
01:07:48,051 --> 01:07:53,795
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is a highly traversed area with people catching the bus and just walking to and from school.

835
01:07:54,176 --> 01:07:55,316
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's right in our crosswalk.

836
01:07:55,356 --> 01:08:00,280
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we could have, um, the electrical department or the DPW department, whoever's that's Mr. Randazzo.

837
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:06,494
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, if we could have him come down or maybe with the assistance of the DPW department, just have him come down and remove that.

838
01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:10,377
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely a safety hazard and it needs to be taken care of right away.

839
01:08:10,778 --> 01:08:11,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

840
01:08:11,058 --> 01:08:11,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

841
01:08:12,059 --> 01:08:15,261
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

842
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:15,922
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

843
01:08:16,402 --> 01:08:16,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

844
01:08:16,522 --> 01:08:20,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

845
01:08:20,965 --> 01:08:24,388
[SPEAKER_17]: 17, 698 offered by Councilors Falco and Scott Pelli.

846
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:28,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Whereas there are a number of blinded intersections located on the Fulton Street

847
01:08:28,675 --> 01:08:40,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the City of Medford install mirrors at the following intersections in the interest of public safety, Fulton Street and Ridgeway Road, Fulton Street and Wausen Street.

848
01:08:40,804 --> 01:08:43,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight, excuse me, Councilor Felco.

849
01:08:44,427 --> 01:08:46,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

850
01:08:46,849 --> 01:08:51,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I've received a lot of phone calls on this as well, and I know my colleague has as well.

851
01:08:52,814 --> 01:08:54,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Up in the Heights, there are a couple of intersections,

852
01:08:56,113 --> 01:09:10,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, and this has actually came up at the police community meeting as well, where if you're going from Fulton street or actually if you're coming from, uh, Watson, uh, coming from Highland Ave and you want to take the left or right onto Fulton street, it's a blind intersection.

853
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,868
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you really, you kind of have to guess if there's any cars coming.

854
01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:15,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Same thing with Ridgeway road.

855
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:19,153
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, so I think a mirror on the, um,

856
01:09:19,694 --> 01:09:24,978
[SPEAKER_11]: telephone pole that actually would help indicate whether or not the cars are coming from the other direction would be beneficial.

857
01:09:25,699 --> 01:09:27,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, you know, from a safety perspective.

858
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:42,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so if we could, uh, if we could actually have, uh, actually probably if we can move this paper to the traffic commission for approval and if we could actually have those, um, mirrors installed, that would be a, I think a great in the interest of public safety.

859
01:09:42,892 --> 01:09:43,232
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

860
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:43,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

861
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:44,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Nice.

862
01:09:46,145 --> 01:09:47,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli's paper as well?

863
01:09:47,826 --> 01:09:49,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Your button was on next.

864
01:09:49,527 --> 01:09:50,147
[SPEAKER_17]: He's a sponsor.

865
01:09:51,128 --> 01:09:51,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

866
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:53,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame, Rick.

867
01:09:53,749 --> 01:09:54,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

868
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:57,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, thank you.

869
01:09:57,671 --> 01:10:01,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco and I both were, I think we were all in attendance at the St.

870
01:10:01,253 --> 01:10:03,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Francis traffic meeting.

871
01:10:03,314 --> 01:10:12,259
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that we talked about where the mayor is, and I believe Chief Sacco said that those wouldn't be an issue.

872
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:12,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And,

873
01:10:13,468 --> 01:10:15,469
[SPEAKER_03]: it would be very helpful for those neighbors.

874
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:22,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, um, with the residents that, that asked and we brought it forward and it seemed like it was pretty positive.

875
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:29,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can get that update and get those, get those installed as soon as possible, it would be greatly appreciated.

876
01:10:29,173 --> 01:10:29,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

877
01:10:29,973 --> 01:10:30,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

878
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:31,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scott.

879
01:10:31,114 --> 01:10:31,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

880
01:10:32,014 --> 01:10:33,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

881
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:35,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you to the sponsors of this resolution.

882
01:10:35,555 --> 01:10:37,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'd like to amend with a B paper as well.

883
01:10:37,396 --> 01:10:40,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, uh, if you're traveling northbound on main street,

884
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:47,202
[SPEAKER_07]: You go underneath the highway, past South Street, underneath the highway, and you go to take a left-hand turn onto Route 16.

885
01:10:48,162 --> 01:11:00,167
[SPEAKER_07]: With the renovations that they've made to the Craddock Bridge and the relocation from the construction on the left side of the street to the right side of the street, right now it's very difficult when you're taking a left-hand turn onto Route 16 to see one whole lane of traffic.

886
01:11:00,907 --> 01:11:09,250
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm asking the engineering department if they'd be willing to take an inspection of the site and make recommendations to improve safety at the location, Mr. President.

887
01:11:10,797 --> 01:11:12,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the main paper, Mr. President.

888
01:11:13,878 --> 01:11:24,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to chime in on what Councilor Scarpelli said, was that a number of locations were mentioned by citizens for up there.

889
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:35,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to urge the chief, who as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, was amenable to these types of improvements to move on them quickly.

890
01:11:36,101 --> 01:11:43,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And to expand the scope, I think there were three or four spots that had been mentioned, if I'm not mistaken, where these would be most helpful.

891
01:11:45,643 --> 01:11:47,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

892
01:11:47,084 --> 01:11:53,045
[SPEAKER_08]: It was serious enough for a significant neighborhood meeting.

893
01:11:54,586 --> 01:11:56,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And the people in there were very patient with us.

894
01:11:57,607 --> 01:11:58,787
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a hot summer night.

895
01:11:59,657 --> 01:12:05,801
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of headway was made and a lot of really thoughtful input was there.

896
01:12:05,841 --> 01:12:15,306
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a lot of people who offered really solid stuff and really solid assessments of what's going on there.

897
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:18,028
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just hope that we're able to

898
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:29,562
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, implement some of these recommendations, have them hashed out in the traffic commission, um, and, and moved on just to give these people some, some relief.

899
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:33,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's a, it's a major regional issue there.

900
01:12:33,903 --> 01:12:35,784
[SPEAKER_08]: They're seeing it acutely.

901
01:12:36,444 --> 01:12:39,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, they shouldn't have to live under this type of disturbance.

902
01:12:39,545 --> 01:12:44,126
[SPEAKER_08]: So the slightest thing we can do to help them, uh, I would, uh, uh, recommend.

903
01:12:45,827 --> 01:12:46,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

904
01:12:47,692 --> 01:12:48,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor vice president box.

905
01:12:49,353 --> 01:12:54,397
[SPEAKER_16]: And just if we can add a resident only, I know that was brought up several times at the meeting too.

906
01:12:55,117 --> 01:13:01,142
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of the roads up there, our residents are looking at resident only because of, uh, the severe cut through traffic.

907
01:13:02,843 --> 01:13:03,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

908
01:13:04,284 --> 01:13:05,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

909
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:08,968
[SPEAKER_13]: George cycle 21 Ridgeway road.

910
01:13:08,988 --> 01:13:14,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, I've been on Ridgeway road for 16 years and I have to thank council Scott Pelly,

911
01:13:15,533 --> 01:13:17,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco for bringing this up tonight.

912
01:13:18,736 --> 01:13:22,659
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to let my neighbors know that maybe we're going to get a mirror there.

913
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:26,022
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so dangerous.

914
01:13:26,963 --> 01:13:32,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I know there's other blind spots in Medford, but Ridgeway Road is so dangerous.

915
01:13:32,848 --> 01:13:34,109
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost like suicide.

916
01:13:34,589 --> 01:13:41,115
[SPEAKER_13]: When you come up Ridgeway Road, you don't even want to try to take a left hand turn at Ridgeway Road because number one,

917
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:45,472
[SPEAKER_13]: The traffic is unbelievable, but number two, the speed.

918
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:54,738
[SPEAKER_13]: They come down, even though the stop sign is at the Fulton Spring Road intersection, they come down that street, 40, 45 miles an hour.

919
01:13:55,218 --> 01:13:57,239
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing no one's been killed, okay?

920
01:13:57,879 --> 01:14:03,563
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're right about the other areas having mirrors.

921
01:14:05,404 --> 01:14:10,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Ridgeway Road, Councilor Box, residents only.

922
01:14:11,927 --> 01:14:14,269
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a no right turn on that street.

923
01:14:14,289 --> 01:14:16,651
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two of them, no right turn.

924
01:14:17,752 --> 01:14:27,820
[SPEAKER_13]: And what I've been finding out is that a lot of the traffic that's coming out of the Heights is not Method residents.

925
01:14:29,342 --> 01:14:34,045
[SPEAKER_13]: What we're seeing is we're seeing a tremendous amount of traffic coming in from Malden, Melrose.

926
01:14:34,886 --> 01:14:37,308
[SPEAKER_13]: They've already been coming off 93, go by the Stonehenge Zoo,

927
01:14:39,307 --> 01:14:44,091
[SPEAKER_13]: And they come down, Elm Street's backed up, they come right around the Rotary and come down Fulton Street.

928
01:14:44,111 --> 01:14:46,813
[SPEAKER_13]: So what you're seeing is a tremendous amount of traffic.

929
01:14:48,154 --> 01:14:54,159
[SPEAKER_13]: The only street off of Fulton Street to get onto 93, other than the Felsway, is Ridgeway Road.

930
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,702
[SPEAKER_13]: I've counted 80, 90 cars in an hour.

931
01:14:58,783 --> 01:15:01,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Some mornings, having a cup of coffee, just watching them coming down.

932
01:15:03,687 --> 01:15:06,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Police enforcement just doesn't exist up there.

933
01:15:07,195 --> 01:15:15,621
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, so I think in the long run, if we can at least get a mirror there, the people on Ridgeway Road, at least we can see that traffic coming down.

934
01:15:15,681 --> 01:15:21,046
[SPEAKER_13]: And most importantly, these people coming down Fulton Street, they're going to be able to see Ridgeway Road.

935
01:15:21,326 --> 01:15:26,870
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's critical, because when they come off Fulton Street, they swing on the other side of Ridgeway Road.

936
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:29,852
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've seen cars hit head on since I've been there.

937
01:15:30,453 --> 01:15:31,554
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank God no one's been killed.

938
01:15:32,354 --> 01:15:33,875
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's another issue.

939
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:35,757
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

940
01:15:36,507 --> 01:15:36,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

941
01:15:36,947 --> 01:15:39,848
[SPEAKER_13]: I was at that meeting and, uh, it was very constructive.

942
01:15:39,908 --> 01:15:43,609
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, hopefully we'll see a mirror on the pole again.

943
01:15:43,649 --> 01:15:43,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

944
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:44,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

945
01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:45,010
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate the time.

946
01:15:47,450 --> 01:15:48,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

947
01:15:50,591 --> 01:15:56,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Ray scaffold nine sensitive as council night stated, um, taking a left onto main street.

948
01:15:56,972 --> 01:15:58,093
[SPEAKER_14]: on to route 16.

949
01:15:58,693 --> 01:15:59,513
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very dangerous.

950
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:13,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Other than especially if there are no police officers there once the site gets closed down for the evening, they should put up barriers so they can't take a left-hand turn because somebody is going to get hurt there if that is opened up.

951
01:16:14,428 --> 01:16:18,590
[SPEAKER_14]: traffic coming the other way, it's very difficult to see the person taking a left hand turn there.

952
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:24,233
[SPEAKER_14]: So let them go through the center and come around and, and take a right to get onto route 16.

953
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:30,116
[SPEAKER_14]: So whatever you guys can do to, um, to make that happen, uh, I would appreciate it.

954
01:16:30,136 --> 01:16:30,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

955
01:16:31,257 --> 01:16:32,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

956
01:16:32,498 --> 01:16:42,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one last thing I know that, um, thank you, Mr. President, but, uh, Councilor Falco's, uh, hard work and, uh, the new traffic, uh, engineer that will be coming in.

957
01:16:42,143 --> 01:16:42,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that,

958
01:16:43,149 --> 01:16:53,651
[SPEAKER_03]: that was one of the, so the residents know that one of the first priorities that they talked about is the Fulton Heights and what's happening there as a major cut through for 93.

959
01:16:53,751 --> 01:16:56,472
[SPEAKER_03]: So it hasn't been forgotten.

960
01:16:56,492 --> 01:17:01,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's one of the things that residents have been stopping me and council Falco about that.

961
01:17:01,273 --> 01:17:04,794
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in the neighborhood that it's where have we gone since that meeting?

962
01:17:04,874 --> 01:17:10,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still a hot topic and we won't let it die across the community.

963
01:17:10,095 --> 01:17:10,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

964
01:17:12,216 --> 01:17:17,879
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilors Falco and Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

965
01:17:17,959 --> 01:17:18,659
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

966
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:18,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

967
01:17:19,459 --> 01:17:20,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

968
01:17:20,380 --> 01:17:21,820
[SPEAKER_17]: With the B paper.

969
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,021
[SPEAKER_17]: With the B paper.

970
01:17:24,842 --> 01:17:29,584
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion by Councilor Scarpelli to take hands, papers in the hands of the clerk.

971
01:17:30,564 --> 01:17:31,665
[SPEAKER_17]: We have two under suspension.

972
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:33,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Under suspension.

973
01:17:33,445 --> 01:17:34,206
[SPEAKER_17]: And under suspension.

974
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

975
01:17:38,508 --> 01:17:39,088
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

976
01:17:41,748 --> 01:17:50,040
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-700 offered by Councilor Knight be it resolved that the tree stump in front of 34th Toro Avenue be removed.

977
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:51,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

978
01:17:53,125 --> 01:17:55,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, Mr. President, a basic service request.

979
01:17:55,108 --> 01:17:56,550
[SPEAKER_07]: I was out knocking on doors yesterday.

980
01:17:57,125 --> 01:17:58,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And I came up to 34 Toro Ave.

981
01:17:59,045 --> 01:18:05,487
[SPEAKER_07]: In front of this residence was a very large tree stump, probably three to four feet in diameter.

982
01:18:06,827 --> 01:18:13,769
[SPEAKER_07]: The tree has been gone for an extended period of time and the residents expressed some frustration that the tree has not been removed yet.

983
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:17,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I told them that I'd do my best to get it removed.

984
01:18:17,230 --> 01:18:21,651
[SPEAKER_07]: I placed the matter on the agenda and I hope that our administration will take the appropriate steps to do such.

985
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:25,152
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by.

986
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:27,653
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falco, all in favor?

987
01:18:27,914 --> 01:18:28,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

988
01:18:28,394 --> 01:18:30,534
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

989
01:18:30,554 --> 01:18:32,075
[SPEAKER_17]: 17-701, offered by Councilor Longo-Kern.

990
01:18:32,435 --> 01:18:48,280
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Metro resident Henry Millering for receiving the MPAH 2017 Patriot Award in recognition of his leadership and contribution to the Haitian community in Massachusetts.

991
01:18:48,661 --> 01:18:50,421
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

992
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:52,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Carvio.

993
01:18:54,002 --> 01:18:55,583
[SPEAKER_09]: I was able to read an article

994
01:18:56,482 --> 01:19:03,026
[SPEAKER_09]: and find out that Henry Malorin is receiving this Patriot Award, and I think it's such an honor.

995
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:11,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Henry is a friend to many of us, and he does a tremendous amount of work in the disability community, but also in the Haitian community, and he's being recognized for it.

996
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,671
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm obviously very proud.

997
01:19:13,691 --> 01:19:23,517
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to have a ceremony for him at the end of the month, and I think it's something that I wanted to bring up just to let him know we appreciate all his hard work and effort for what he does

998
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:26,084
[SPEAKER_09]: a tremendous amount of people.

999
01:19:26,284 --> 01:19:28,946
[SPEAKER_17]: If you'd like to invite him up here for a citation by the council?

1000
01:19:28,966 --> 01:19:29,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1001
01:19:29,527 --> 01:19:30,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Be appreciated.

1002
01:19:31,629 --> 01:19:32,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

1003
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:33,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1004
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:38,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I thank my colleague Brianna Longo-Curran for bringing this forward.

1005
01:19:38,474 --> 01:19:50,905
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I had a problem about three months ago with a resident, a Haitian resident, that young teenager that was having some issues with a passport.

1006
01:19:51,711 --> 01:19:55,913
[SPEAKER_03]: to get to his grandmother's funeral in Haiti.

1007
01:19:56,553 --> 01:20:08,978
[SPEAKER_03]: And all I had to do was make one phone call to Henry, and the consulate called this young man back and made sure that he could be back home with his family to rest his grandmother at peace.

1008
01:20:09,058 --> 01:20:11,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are just little things that Henry does.

1009
01:20:11,879 --> 01:20:16,801
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, too, he's a great man and a recognition well-deserved.

1010
01:20:17,061 --> 01:20:17,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1011
01:20:18,562 --> 01:20:19,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Marx.

1012
01:20:20,188 --> 01:20:21,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1013
01:20:21,048 --> 01:20:25,349
[SPEAKER_16]: I too just would like to thank Councilor Lungo for bringing this recognition.

1014
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:36,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Henry's been a long established member of this community, and as Councilor Scott Pelli so eloquently said, will be the first to step forward in order to help someone that's in need.

1015
01:20:37,133 --> 01:20:42,714
[SPEAKER_16]: And I too want to thank him for all his efforts on behalf of all Method residents in this community.

1016
01:20:43,734 --> 01:20:44,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Vice Presidents.

1017
01:20:45,795 --> 01:20:46,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1018
01:20:47,165 --> 01:20:50,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I think my colleagues have hit the nail on the head.

1019
01:20:51,307 --> 01:20:55,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Miller's work in the community is not just limited to that at the MPHA.

1020
01:20:55,808 --> 01:21:05,212
[SPEAKER_07]: He's also been a strong advocate for the disabled in our community, and he's also been a strong advocate for his neighbors, and he's been a strong member of the Democratic Party, chairing our Ward 6 City Committee.

1021
01:21:05,812 --> 01:21:09,273
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, thank you, Henry, for your service and your work, and congratulations.

1022
01:21:10,294 --> 01:21:11,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1023
01:21:11,294 --> 01:21:11,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1024
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I also just wanted to take a second to congratulate Henry.

1025
01:21:14,676 --> 01:21:16,457
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a big part of our community.

1026
01:21:16,577 --> 01:21:17,577
[SPEAKER_11]: He's always there when you need him.

1027
01:21:17,897 --> 01:21:21,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, he's, uh, uh, helping organize that word six, uh, candidates tonight.

1028
01:21:21,799 --> 01:21:22,679
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's always active.

1029
01:21:22,699 --> 01:21:23,680
[SPEAKER_11]: He's always there when you need him.

1030
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:24,300
[SPEAKER_11]: He's a great guy.

1031
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:25,780
[SPEAKER_11]: And so congratulations to Henry.

1032
01:21:26,701 --> 01:21:31,883
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, it's not a week old that it goes by that I don't talk to Henry and he's a good man and good leader of this community.

1033
01:21:32,363 --> 01:21:36,505
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're glad I'd say I'd like to have him come down for a citation the next few weeks.

1034
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:45,085
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilman O'Connor, seconded by second by Councilor DelaRusso and Councilor Scott Pelli.

1035
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:45,665
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor.

1036
01:21:46,566 --> 01:21:47,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1037
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:58,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Offered by Councilor Falco being resolved at the Memphis City Council requests that the tree warden examined the tree in front of St.

1038
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:01,775
[SPEAKER_17]: Francis Parish Center in the interest of public safety.

1039
01:22:02,694 --> 01:22:03,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Falco.

1040
01:22:03,795 --> 01:22:04,755
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1041
01:22:04,815 --> 01:22:11,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I, uh, had the, uh, I actually received a call from a resident the other day and, uh, I actually took a walk down there to check it out myself.

1042
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:14,240
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a tree, a rather large tree in front of a St.

1043
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis parish center.

1044
01:22:15,921 --> 01:22:22,024
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure if there was a car accident there recently, but it looks like it is just hollowed out completely.

1045
01:22:22,505 --> 01:22:23,685
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a really large tree.

1046
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:26,667
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm really concerned that this thing is about to tip.

1047
01:22:26,727 --> 01:22:27,127
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um,

1048
01:22:27,602 --> 01:22:41,591
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could send, I know the tree is on the Felsway, but if we could send out, uh, our tree warden just to take a look to see, uh, what, what exactly route should be, what route should be taken as far as if the tree is, uh, you know, if it's still viable, I guess.

1049
01:22:41,631 --> 01:22:47,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the tree looks like it's about to go and I really have a major concern that it's going to fall into the road.

1050
01:22:47,756 --> 01:22:49,677
[SPEAKER_11]: It's, it's large and it literally has,

1051
01:22:50,268 --> 01:22:51,108
[SPEAKER_11]: It looks like it's hollow.

1052
01:22:51,428 --> 01:22:58,311
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm assuming if we could have a tree warden go out there as soon as possible to take a look into this, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1053
01:22:58,531 --> 01:22:58,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1054
01:22:59,011 --> 01:22:59,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1055
01:22:59,891 --> 01:23:00,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Dela Russo.

1056
01:23:01,151 --> 01:23:07,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I feel that I should inform the body that that tree no longer exists.

1057
01:23:07,834 --> 01:23:08,374
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gone.

1058
01:23:09,074 --> 01:23:12,635
[SPEAKER_08]: When I made the bend around to be on time for a 10 o'clock funeral mass at St.

1059
01:23:12,675 --> 01:23:18,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Francis this morning, the tree was being taken down right before our eyes.

1060
01:23:19,313 --> 01:23:22,796
[SPEAKER_08]: shredded into a million pieces and thrown into a truck and driven away.

1061
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1062
01:23:29,381 --> 01:23:31,583
[SPEAKER_11]: When I left early this morning, it was still there.

1063
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:33,664
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, I'm glad they took care of it right away.

1064
01:23:33,825 --> 01:23:34,685
[SPEAKER_11]: They knew this was coming.

1065
01:23:35,046 --> 01:23:35,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1066
01:23:35,846 --> 01:23:38,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad to hear what was done.

1067
01:23:38,809 --> 01:23:40,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I received the same call.

1068
01:23:43,687 --> 01:23:46,407
[SPEAKER_16]: and I'm glad to hear that the tree was definitely a public safety concern.

1069
01:23:46,427 --> 01:23:47,768
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad to hear it's been removed.

1070
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:51,328
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1071
01:23:51,348 --> 01:23:52,409
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1072
01:23:53,349 --> 01:23:54,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1073
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:55,389
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I apologize.

1074
01:23:55,409 --> 01:23:56,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, sir.

1075
01:23:56,169 --> 01:23:57,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

1076
01:23:57,509 --> 01:23:58,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1077
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:12,312
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Tree City, one of the Tree City Americas, there's a lot of them, but City Hall has bragging rights again this year in Tree City, and what I'm concerned about is people know that last year I saved a tree that wasn't supposed to be taken down.

1078
01:24:13,509 --> 01:24:14,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1079
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:16,991
[SPEAKER_12]: If that one was hollowed out, we don't want to have problems.

1080
01:24:17,051 --> 01:24:21,533
[SPEAKER_12]: When I first moved here, the tree in front of my house was rotting and the wires came down.

1081
01:24:21,593 --> 01:24:21,893
[SPEAKER_12]: That was 2003, 2004.

1082
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:29,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was a tree hearing and I went to it and on Paris Street, there's a beautiful tree.

1083
01:24:29,477 --> 01:24:30,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Now this tree is healthy.

1084
01:24:31,038 --> 01:24:32,258
[SPEAKER_12]: The street is a mess.

1085
01:24:32,979 --> 01:24:35,380
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a petition to take the tree down.

1086
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:41,223
[SPEAKER_12]: My concern with it is the street itself is a mess and is a big hazard, a bigger hazard than any tree.

1087
01:24:41,788 --> 01:24:45,332
[SPEAKER_12]: You can pave around the trees, you can put a handicap access.

1088
01:24:45,392 --> 01:24:48,756
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1089
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:58,827
[SPEAKER_03]: At the podium, Harris Street, I talked to the city engineer today, it's ready for some work and repaving, so pretty excited about that.

1090
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:02,251
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great to hear, Councillor Scarpelli.

1091
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:05,813
[SPEAKER_12]: That is great to hear because the streets around there have been hazardous.

1092
01:25:06,433 --> 01:25:10,174
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would like to see, if we're Tree City USA, I just wanna see the good, healthy trees.

1093
01:25:10,715 --> 01:25:18,498
[SPEAKER_12]: If the roots are coming up, we need to pave around them, build a nice way to keep the tree preserved because it's the tallest tree on Parris Street.

1094
01:25:18,998 --> 01:25:21,439
[SPEAKER_12]: But it is great to see that Medford cares about trees.

1095
01:25:21,499 --> 01:25:23,080
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanna see that we protect the good ones.

1096
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:23,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1097
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:27,702
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councillor Falco, seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

1098
01:25:27,762 --> 01:25:28,302
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1099
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:32,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes offered by count by vice president marks.

1100
01:25:32,492 --> 01:25:38,575
[SPEAKER_17]: We have resolved that the street be repaired at four and nine six winter street in the interest of public safety.

1101
01:25:39,355 --> 01:25:40,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice president marks.

1102
01:25:41,316 --> 01:25:42,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1103
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:56,644
[SPEAKER_16]: I know council at night brought up this issue last week, but I received an email from a resident that lives at four 96 Winthrop street that stated that the street in front of his home is in deplorable condition.

1104
01:25:57,189 --> 01:26:00,250
[SPEAKER_16]: You also referred to the corner of Wildwood and Woodford.

1105
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:12,895
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Councilor Knight brought that up last week, and I would ask that because of the utility excavation that's going on there, that that area be looked at immediately, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

1106
01:26:13,055 --> 01:26:13,295
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1107
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:16,656
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

1108
01:26:17,256 --> 01:26:17,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1109
01:26:18,036 --> 01:26:22,378
[SPEAKER_17]: Offered by Vice President Marks, be it resolved that the missing cement sidewalk from

1110
01:26:25,358 --> 01:26:26,839
[SPEAKER_17]: 63 Bowen Avenue be replaced.

1111
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:28,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Mox.

1112
01:26:29,421 --> 01:26:30,442
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1113
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:33,304
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the sidewalk I referred to earlier.

1114
01:26:33,905 --> 01:26:41,311
[SPEAKER_16]: They removed a tree and just left the vacant hole there for some time now.

1115
01:26:42,011 --> 01:26:46,475
[SPEAKER_16]: And this definitely needs to be re-cemented in the interest of public safety.

1116
01:26:47,115 --> 01:26:49,017
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a very hazardous trip and fall.

1117
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,800
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Councilor Mox, second.

1118
01:26:54,098 --> 01:26:55,119
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1119
01:26:55,139 --> 01:26:55,699
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

1120
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:55,779
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1121
01:26:56,499 --> 01:26:57,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1122
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,401
[SPEAKER_17]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

1123
01:27:00,121 --> 01:27:04,783
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the stump at 6466 Bowen Avenue be removed.

1124
01:27:05,123 --> 01:27:10,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved that the sidewalk at 8789 Bowen Avenue be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1125
01:27:10,826 --> 01:27:11,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Marks.

1126
01:27:12,007 --> 01:27:12,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1127
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:13,607
[SPEAKER_16]: The sidewalk at 8789

1128
01:27:15,416 --> 01:27:18,337
[SPEAKER_16]: was dug up, according to the resident, about four months ago.

1129
01:27:19,077 --> 01:27:25,438
[SPEAKER_16]: And now there's just some orange cones sitting out there with a giant hole waiting for someone to fall into it.

1130
01:27:26,298 --> 01:27:28,599
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that DPW go out there immediately.

1131
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:44,162
[SPEAKER_16]: And the tree stump, just for my expertise as an arborist, which I'm not, looks like it's been there for about 25 years based on the outer coating of the stump itself.

1132
01:27:44,703 --> 01:27:51,024
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that that stump, Mr. President, be ground down immediately in the interest of public safety.

1133
01:27:51,545 --> 01:28:00,907
[SPEAKER_16]: I also, Mr. President, I need to say, in an agenda that had some 18 items, over a third of the items are for tree stump and sidewalks.

1134
01:28:01,987 --> 01:28:09,068
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's much more, and those are important issues, but those are the day-to-day issues that should be attended to by the city.

1135
01:28:09,388 --> 01:28:12,069
[SPEAKER_16]: There's much more important issues regarding zoning,

1136
01:28:12,392 --> 01:28:39,398
[SPEAKER_16]: public safety, airplane noise, uh, things that we should be attending to and discussing and really not bogging down, uh, our agenda with issues that should be, you know, it should be an automatic, uh, you know, so I would hope that the process, uh, regarding the sidewalks and streets, uh, especially with, uh, the three one one system where residents can actually reach directly out.

1137
01:28:39,879 --> 01:28:41,459
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole reason why we did three one one,

1138
01:28:41,835 --> 01:28:48,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Does the council remember it was a way that the residents can interact with the city and then get a response.

1139
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:56,384
[SPEAKER_16]: So that tells me one or two things, Mr. President, that the three one one system is not working and that needs to be revisited.

1140
01:28:57,089 --> 01:29:01,210
[SPEAKER_16]: or that, as was mentioned earlier, that we don't have the manpower.

1141
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,871
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it was Mr. McKillop that mentioned that.

1142
01:29:04,271 --> 01:29:18,814
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have the manpower to handle the need that we have in a city that's, you know, seven square miles with 56,000 people in it, Mr. President, and something needs to be done.

1143
01:29:19,655 --> 01:29:20,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1144
01:29:20,735 --> 01:29:25,037
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor Felco, all in favor.

1145
01:29:25,717 --> 01:29:27,617
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Mr. McKellar, I apologize.

1146
01:29:28,037 --> 01:29:28,718
[SPEAKER_15]: No worries, no worries.

1147
01:29:29,818 --> 01:29:37,440
[SPEAKER_15]: My question on the 311 call, where does it go into and who's monitoring it and what kind of a graph comes out of that?

1148
01:29:37,960 --> 01:29:41,981
[SPEAKER_15]: Where is that list of all of those items and the age of those items?

1149
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:46,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I believe that if you actually take the list, if it's done, if it's there, if it's somewhere,

1150
01:29:48,064 --> 01:29:59,419
[SPEAKER_15]: And you go by the age of the issues and you start to break them down I believe it should be very palatable to get these things done in in a seasonal Seasonable manner and putting it into the budget.

1151
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,844
[SPEAKER_15]: So so if if the first season of

1152
01:30:03,805 --> 01:30:10,528
[SPEAKER_15]: The first quarter, you get 10 of those sidewalks that are 15, 20 years old that are issues, you get them out of the way.

1153
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:13,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you work on the next 5 to 10 year old ones, you get those out of the way.

1154
01:30:13,790 --> 01:30:18,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Then you work on the next 1, 2, 3, 4 year old ones, and you get those out of the way.

1155
01:30:19,673 --> 01:30:24,836
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no rhyme or reason as to the way we do this as far as I can see.

1156
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:26,236
[SPEAKER_15]: So where are the 311s going?

1157
01:30:27,952 --> 01:30:29,033
[SPEAKER_15]: What list is it on?

1158
01:30:29,634 --> 01:30:32,296
[SPEAKER_15]: What is the chronological age of each of these items?

1159
01:30:32,436 --> 01:30:33,918
[SPEAKER_15]: And how do we attack this?

1160
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:35,079
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really what we need to do.

1161
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:40,685
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, again, common sense, looking at the problems, breaking them down so it's more palatable.

1162
01:30:41,025 --> 01:30:43,147
[SPEAKER_15]: You can fit them into the budget so it's easy to do.

1163
01:30:43,507 --> 01:30:48,392
[SPEAKER_15]: And you let the people know it's coming, and we're doing it, and we're working on it.

1164
01:30:48,532 --> 01:30:48,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1165
01:30:49,513 --> 01:30:49,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1166
01:30:52,669 --> 01:30:59,432
[SPEAKER_17]: offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that the sidewalk at 63 Tainter Street be replaced in the interest of public safety.

1167
01:30:59,752 --> 01:31:00,792
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Mox.

1168
01:31:01,453 --> 01:31:10,636
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, Mr. President, the concrete was broken up and removed some time back, and there is just a hole there waiting for new cement.

1169
01:31:11,197 --> 01:31:19,440
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been over several months, and in the interest of public safety, that should be replaced immediately, Mr. President.

1170
01:31:20,295 --> 01:31:21,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1171
01:31:21,256 --> 01:31:22,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1172
01:31:22,056 --> 01:31:24,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I have received a call about this as well.

1173
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:33,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And I went down to take a look at the situation and like the council said, it's just a hole in the ground and there's no, there's no curb in there.

1174
01:31:33,565 --> 01:31:39,610
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess a few years ago they tried to plant the tree there, but the tree literally just fell out because there's no curbing to hold the soil in.

1175
01:31:40,150 --> 01:31:41,891
[SPEAKER_11]: So really the curb needs to be replaced.

1176
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:43,132
[SPEAKER_11]: There really needs to be a strategy.

1177
01:31:43,172 --> 01:31:48,036
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for Bowen street in general, uh, like council Marks mentioned, I took a drive there as well.

1178
01:31:48,056 --> 01:31:49,517
[SPEAKER_11]: There's sidewalks are really,

1179
01:31:50,113 --> 01:31:50,793
[SPEAKER_11]: bad shape.

1180
01:31:50,853 --> 01:31:53,234
[SPEAKER_17]: There's some flooding issues on Bowen Avenue.

1181
01:31:53,254 --> 01:32:02,135
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the sidewalks look like they might just need a skim coat, but I mean, just because a few, they just kind of, the top's gone, but there's other, there's other sidewalks that are just completely gone.

1182
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:03,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1183
01:32:03,395 --> 01:32:07,576
[SPEAKER_17]: The upper part of Bowen Avenue has some pretty serious flooding issues when it rains.

1184
01:32:07,616 --> 01:32:10,337
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know they're in the midst of addressing those also.

1185
01:32:11,337 --> 01:32:15,037
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1186
01:32:15,877 --> 01:32:16,558
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor.

1187
01:32:17,558 --> 01:32:18,558
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1188
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:20,591
[SPEAKER_17]: The table records.

1189
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:23,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President, I'm sorry.

1190
01:32:24,793 --> 01:32:25,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1191
01:32:25,813 --> 01:32:31,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I just want to take a brief opportunity to thank the DPW for the restriping work that they've done on Moobin Street.

1192
01:32:31,316 --> 01:32:37,859
[SPEAKER_07]: We put a resolution forward last week asking that the four-way intersections on Moobin Street be repainted, and in short time, they were done.

1193
01:32:37,879 --> 01:32:42,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to thank Joe Palladino from the sign department and the members of the highway department for their work.

1194
01:32:43,882 --> 01:32:44,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1195
01:32:45,983 --> 01:32:46,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Longo Kern.

1196
01:32:48,485 --> 01:32:49,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to talk on that?

1197
01:32:50,265 --> 01:32:52,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.

1198
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:53,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm president Carvello.

1199
01:32:53,549 --> 01:32:59,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Just before we adjourn, I know that there is no school committee meeting on October 30th.

1200
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:04,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So I see if we could maybe take a vote to move our October 31st meeting to October 30th.

1201
01:33:04,981 --> 01:33:08,165
[SPEAKER_17]: If you'd like to make that into a motion.

1202
01:33:09,286 --> 01:33:09,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

1203
01:33:10,227 --> 01:33:10,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1204
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:19,942
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion by Council Member Kern, that we change the October 31st meeting to October 30th.

1205
01:33:23,462 --> 01:33:24,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Dela Rosa.

1206
01:33:24,823 --> 01:33:26,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be opposed to that, Mr. President.

1207
01:33:26,663 --> 01:33:26,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1208
01:33:27,283 --> 01:33:33,904
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wouldn't hold it against any councilor who wanted to spend one evening with their children to do it.

1209
01:33:33,924 --> 01:33:37,825
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the people have reasonable expectation that we meet on Tuesday nights.

1210
01:33:38,729 --> 01:33:41,412
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been our constant practice.

1211
01:33:41,832 --> 01:33:42,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of our rules.

1212
01:33:43,514 --> 01:33:49,659
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't see this as a compelling reason to change the date of meeting.

1213
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:51,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1214
01:33:53,623 --> 01:33:54,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Marks.

1215
01:33:55,825 --> 01:34:05,113
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just wondering maybe if the counselor or the council would be amendable to possibly meeting at six or 630 that night rather than seven o'clock.

1216
01:34:07,135 --> 01:34:08,576
[SPEAKER_16]: It's still, it's still a Tuesday.

1217
01:34:08,756 --> 01:34:10,857
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, you know, need an hour earlier.

1218
01:34:10,877 --> 01:34:14,538
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't, I think that makes it worse.

1219
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:16,539
[SPEAKER_16]: That makes it worse.

1220
01:34:16,839 --> 01:34:17,400
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes it worse.

1221
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:17,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1222
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:19,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1223
01:34:23,382 --> 01:34:23,942
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1224
01:34:24,243 --> 01:34:29,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I was just going to say that I have no problem coming on Tuesday night.

1225
01:34:29,165 --> 01:34:35,247
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's one of the sacrifices that we make if we have the privilege and opportunity to serve as council is that sometimes we have to spend time away from our family.

1226
01:34:35,828 --> 01:34:36,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but with that being said,

1227
01:34:37,263 --> 01:34:40,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that I can still get some trick or treating in between five and seven.

1228
01:34:40,645 --> 01:34:43,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, my kids are young, but I'm moving it to an earlier time.

1229
01:34:43,407 --> 01:34:44,448
