Hi, I'm Justin Tsang.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,583
I'm the son of Taiwanese immigrants and I'm running for Medford City Council.

3
00:00:06,064 --> 00:00:10,328
Growing up in the working-class Wellington area, my parents worked around the clock to build a family.

4
00:00:10,508 --> 00:00:13,351
They instilled in me the values of hard work and getting involved.

5
00:00:13,691 --> 00:00:21,298
As a proud son of Medford and the product of the public school system, I graduated valedictorian of Medford High School and went on to attend Harvard University.

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,223
As we recover from this pandemic, we must ask ourselves, what kind of Medford do we want to live in?

7
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:28,805
My plan will fight for a future that works for everyone.

8
00:00:29,065 --> 00:00:33,249
Build a Medford we can afford by protecting tenants' rights and expanding affordable housing.

9
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:37,932
Strengthening our schools by reversing education cuts and eliminating regressive student fees.

10
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:43,477
Invest in climate and infrastructure by reducing emissions and paving safer, transit-oriented streets.

11
00:00:43,737 --> 00:00:48,341
And foster an inclusive city where politicians aren't afraid to stand up to systemic racism.

12
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:54,726
A city as vibrant as Medford deserves a strong, diverse city council with new energy and new ideas.
