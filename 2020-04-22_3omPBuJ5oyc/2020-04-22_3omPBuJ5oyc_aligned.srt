00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:08,863
Good evening, Medford Parents and Guardians, and anyone who might be watching.

2
00:00:10,163 --> 00:00:15,985
We'll wait until we see the number of people really get up before we kick off.

3
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:17,345
There we go, 23 people.

4
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:17,865
All right.

5
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:23,387
Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:23,407 --> 00:00:27,648
Like I said, we'll get started as soon as more people show up.

7
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:31,188
My apologies for my normal look.

8
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:42,131
A lot of you know me in a suit and tidied up, but being at home has caused me to wear hats because I haven't been able to get a haircut and other things.

9
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:47,753
So if I look a little bit different than normal, just know that I'm doing it from the comforts of my home.

10
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:54,195
You still look good, Mr. DeLeva.

11
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:54,755
Thank you.

12
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:55,315
Thank you.

13
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:00,582
Coming back, I have my baseball cap turned backwards, so.

14
00:01:01,023 --> 00:01:03,203
Good.

15
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:18,610
So for those parents who are in students and anyone else who's joining us, you're watching us on Facebook Live and we're using a functionality called StreamYard.

16
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:23,472
And the way you can participate is by commenting in the comment box.

17
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:34,860
and the comments will show up and we can then put you in with your ideas, your questions, and anything like this.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,122
So I'll just share with you a couple of the examples right now.

19
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:39,723
So there's one.

20
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:43,264
There you go.

21
00:01:45,546 --> 00:01:47,587
And then that way we can,

22
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:53,154
That way we can hear your ideas and see the best ways to support.

23
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:54,875
My name is David Cushing.

24
00:01:54,895 --> 00:01:55,996
I'm the assistant superintendent.

25
00:01:56,016 --> 00:02:06,682
For those of you who don't know me, this is going to be run by the headmaster and his team, as well as Mr. Fallon from the vocational side as well.

26
00:02:06,762 --> 00:02:11,385
So I'm going to add Mr. Fallon, and I'm going to back out of the studio myself.

27
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:15,247
So I leave it in the more than capable hands of our leadership team.

28
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:19,499
So again, good evening everyone.

29
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:30,155
My goal here is to sort of moderate and use this as a way for us to kind of understand the outside

30
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:34,757
what your vision is moving forward.

31
00:02:35,437 --> 00:02:42,845
I'll state it again as was stated in the school committee meeting that we have no intentions of canceling any events.

32
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:52,476
We have more than our intentions of more is to doing postponement but what that would look like because school is now closed

33
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:58,232
till the end of the school year may be different than what we normally have.

34
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:01,092
And there could be virtual things that we can do.

35
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:17,095
There also could be, you know, remote things that we do, or we do a gathering later down the, in the fall or in the summer, if we have the go ahead to congregate as a greater group.

36
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:21,936
So again, tonight is more of a way for us to kind of

37
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:26,341
here and see what you feel from the outside.

38
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:33,344
I would ask and I see that Mark is joining in and he is the senior class president.

39
00:03:34,145 --> 00:03:38,907
So I would ask that we do this in sort of a three kind of step format.

40
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:48,307
my first would be to really get some student input, because I think that's something that's very important of what they would like to see happen.

41
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,728
And then get the parent input from there.

42
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:58,770
And then we can start to figure out, you know, which road we're going to go down to hosting these events.

43
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,411
So, Mark, are you there?

44
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:04,171
I see that you are.

45
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:09,743
Mark can unmute his mic, it looks like.

46
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,806
This is a new platform.

47
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:18,286
Hello, can you hear me now?

48
00:04:18,746 --> 00:04:19,726
Yes, Mark, we can.

49
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:20,227
Thank you.

50
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:25,608
Hello, I can't really hear Mr. DeLava, so I don't know if he really said anything directly at me.

51
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:27,269
But I just wanted to say hello.

52
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:29,289
I'm Mark Allen G. Mary.

53
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,370
I'm a student.

54
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,470
I'm class president.

55
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,051
And I just wanted to really quickly just

56
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,265
Thank you everyone for coming and sitting in meetings.

57
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,908
We're aware of your concerns.

58
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,431
And a lot of people have been messaging me being concerned about a senior event.

59
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:49,155
And at the class office, we're doing our best to really try and get everything rolling.

60
00:04:49,175 --> 00:04:52,658
And just doing the best that we can with like the situation.

61
00:04:53,498 --> 00:04:57,021
And we have to remember that the main concern is safety.

62
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:03,487
So everyone can play a role with being, because everyone is playing a role to helping bring down that curve.

63
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:04,982
So that's the main concern.

64
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:08,904
And social distancing does not have to mean not being connected socially.

65
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:17,487
I mean, it's more of a physical distancing, but I encourage everyone to just keep talking with your friends, keep talking to one another, tell us where you're going.

66
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:31,953
We have this page on Instagram where you could check out where all the seniors, their future plans, what their future plans are, and just share on social media, keep talking, and then everything is gonna get back to normal, but we have to play an active role.

67
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,821
try to everyone is in this fight against the virus.

68
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:42,465
So it's impacting everyone, but I'm encouraging you to make the best out of the situation.

69
00:05:43,085 --> 00:05:43,765
Thank you very much.

70
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,046
Thanks, Mark.

71
00:05:45,486 --> 00:05:53,330
Mark, I have a couple of questions and maybe some seniors are on, can comment as well.

72
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:58,853
Has anybody given you any thought to what they would like regarding COVID?

73
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,094
I'm on for a while, but I can't hear Mr. DeLay.

74
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:01,855
Oh, okay.

75
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:09,789
So, yeah, that's going to be useless of me talking then with no response.

76
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:29,001
Maybe if there are seniors that are on the, seniors that are on the actual chat here, do you want to post any comments regarding what you have for a vision of a prom and graduation?

77
00:06:38,825 --> 00:06:53,011
Well, maybe one day if there are students tied into the presentation here, if those students can at least give a shout out and let us know that you're watching this right now.

78
00:06:53,171 --> 00:07:03,475
So if there's any kids on here and you want to add some things like some of the parents have done just to say you're watching right now, then we can see who's involved at the moment.

79
00:07:07,024 --> 00:07:34,923
Um so I have a couple uh yes so Leanna's has a post that's that's interesting that miss Donald mentioned the question concerning prom I don't know if miss Don you want to talk about it or do you want me to go ahead um well yeah you could you could talk about it well uh in our last meeting um we had this very same conversation and uh

80
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:43,047
A lot of students feel that the two most important senior events are the senior prom and graduation.

81
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:54,755
So we talked about, they know that the prom that we had arranged for at the Marriott can't happen at the Marriott.

82
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:56,636
The Marriott's closed till June 1st.

83
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,378
I also let them know that

84
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:04,684
the manager of the Marriott could not have been lovelier.

85
00:08:04,824 --> 00:08:06,185
He was tremendous.

86
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:09,867
He said he also had a daughter that was a senior in high school.

87
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,889
And he said he would work with us.

88
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:21,933
And if we wanted to put a prom together in the future at the Marriott, then we could make that happen.

89
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:26,856
So one of the things that we did as a group

90
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,761
is we talked not knowing that we would not be back at school.

91
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:46,126
So we talked about doing something that wasn't just a prom and a graduation, something that was a series of events that could very closely tied together.

92
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:53,909
So for example, where the prom would be one day a cookout or a breakfast or

93
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:23,188
yearbooks the second day and then graduation the third day so that what I heard students saying was they didn't just want an event, they wanted a celebration, they wanted something that even if it was a non-traditional in many different ways, but that the one tradition they were holding on to was a black tie event where they could

94
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:33,205
dance and, but that they wanted to have a multi-day sort of series of events.

95
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:37,587
Mark, do you think that, does that pretty much summarize what people were coming for?

96
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:41,589
And there's also a concern about some people already got their outfits.

97
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:46,432
So we're trying to have it in a way that you can dress up if you want to, and still have that vision.

98
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:51,234
Because some people have been thinking about their outfit for since last year, even before that.

99
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:53,075
So that's a big concern of all

100
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:56,083
is the outfit, can I still wear that outfit?

101
00:09:56,103 --> 00:10:08,469
So yes, we're trying to make it in a way that you can dress up if you want, or if you don't, you don't feel like going all the way, you can still, it's like there's level to really dress how you want.

102
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:15,312
And it's mainly centered around having a closure and really having fun.

103
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:20,335
So that's gonna be our priority to really bring together the event in that way.

104
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:42,139
So the idea then would sort of stem from the graduation ceremony being the ending ceremony, is that the thought process, like if we do a series of events, the final piece would be the graduation.

105
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,621
I believe so.

106
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:45,943
I think that's what people were focused on.

107
00:10:47,444 --> 00:10:47,945
So then,

108
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:59,800
You know, another thing that we need to bring up regarding graduation is that I think Tufts University is going to be in the same boat as what the Marriott is going to be at.

109
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:07,183
So what we have normally done may not be the typical graduation that we usually do.

110
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:15,847
Now, what's a good thing is that we are in control of Hormel Stadium and that we could definitely

111
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,204
do something to that nature of hosting a graduation in that area.

112
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:36,711
I know I mentioned it at school committee, and I kind of want to reiterate it, that for the seniors, and if you want to get that message out, Mr. Black and I have, we do have your caps and gowns.

113
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:39,873
We would like to distribute those to you.

114
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:41,294
We just have to plan that out.

115
00:11:41,354 --> 00:11:42,835
Right now we're in the middle of the search.

116
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:47,118
So doing that at this point in time is probably not a wise move.

117
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,848
on anybody's part.

118
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:58,376
But when things start to settle down, I think that we could definitely do a kind of a social distance line for everyone to get their caps and gowns.

119
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:04,421
I think that's a, you know, a normal tradition is to have your cap and to decorate your cap how you want to decorate your cap.

120
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:11,327
Because if I hold those in possession, you guys don't have the ability to do what you want to do for the future.

121
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,408
So I definitely want to get

122
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:15,077
goes out to you so that you have it.

123
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:22,442
Now, what I'd ask for the seniors is please don't lose it because we're talking of something that could occur in the summer or could occur in the fall.

124
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:25,004
So something to kind of keep that in mind.

125
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:25,864
And I didn't know, Ms.

126
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:34,551
Donnell, and I didn't ask you, but would it make sense to also do the senior gifts when we do the distribution of the caps and gowns as well?

127
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:35,812
I didn't know if that was something.

128
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:36,512
You know what?

129
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:39,715
I think we could do that.

130
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:40,655
We could

131
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:53,871
sort of promise them for whatever the first event is, like a memento of the event or senior year.

132
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:59,554
I mean, we could do that either way, I guess is what I'm saying.

133
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:11,222
I would only worry that if someone picks up their cap and gown and the senior gift,

134
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:16,857
that the message they may take away is, well, they're done.

135
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:17,617
We're done.

136
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:21,699
And I wouldn't want that to send that message.

137
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:30,284
Typically, the senior gift is given out at the senior breakfast where students get their yearbooks.

138
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:35,847
I believe the plan is still on for yearbooks to be ready by the end of June.

139
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:39,449
So there are some options there, I think.

140
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:41,250
OK.

141
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:45,830
I want to, I just want to introduce one thing to all the listeners.

142
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,331
Please keep the comments coming.

143
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:48,992
Those are great.

144
00:13:49,332 --> 00:14:07,422
You know, what we're seeing is we're having, you know, sort of this conversation and what I'd like to see concurrently is if you keep filtering those ideas in, we will keep a good log of everything that people suggest and also continue using the Facebook page that the parents have set up.

145
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:09,183
Thank you to the parents who took the lead on that.

146
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,312
And I continue to use that as a forum to share ideas.

147
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:21,278
Um, you know, as Mr. DeLava has been saying consistently, we are very interested in really doing as much as we can safely, um, as soon as we can.

148
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:27,882
And in a way that is, uh, is truly, you know, honoring and recognizing, you know, all these great kids.

149
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:28,563
Okay.

150
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:35,747
So just want to interject, just keep the information like, especially right now, I just see, uh, you know, the comment down there from Anthony and the good ones that came up from the others initially.

151
00:14:36,128 --> 00:14:36,388
Thank you.

152
00:14:36,928 --> 00:14:38,930
Mr. Fallon is present on this call.

153
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,430
So if you.

154
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:48,972
um there's some questions regarding the vocational banquet and I don't think that again that's not we're looking to do as many events as we possibly can.

155
00:14:49,032 --> 00:15:00,826
I know that a lot of focus is on prom and graduation and again I say that because this is where a great group of students or our mass number of students will be attending these

156
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:21,948
These events so The other thing I think we didn't mention regarding this calls if I'm sure this this is actually being recorded So whatever comments we don't address we can always go back as as a group here and review what you've put down I've seen a lot of people saying things about Hormel and thumbs up to Hormel so I

157
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:32,190
the fact that that's something that you feel very comfortable with, that kind of guides us in a direction on how to kind of figure out how to manage that next piece as well.

158
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,453
So thank you for those comments and to keep them coming.

159
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:40,257
Mr. Fallon, do you want to say anything regarding vocational events?

160
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:52,651
Just that at this time, we're looking at all ways to still have all the events we wanted to have, our senior awards, some kind of recognition for all the seniors and their 15 programs.

161
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:53,752
It's all in the works.

162
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:57,055
All of us have been meeting weekly with all your teachers.

163
00:15:57,075 --> 00:16:00,258
We're meeting again Friday to talk next steps now that we know we're going to be over the year.

164
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:00,998
So hang in there, guys.

165
00:16:01,018 --> 00:16:01,659
We're thinking of you.

166
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:09,686
One of the last comments was about combining events.

167
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:13,417
I think that's, I think it's a great suggestion.

168
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:35,666
I think combining things like a breakfast, yearbook, senior gift, maybe with some music, something very similar to what we did at the holiday breakfast where, I mean, we could, I think, most definitely combine events.

169
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:38,287
Can I jump in really fast?

170
00:16:39,363 --> 00:16:40,683
Yep, go right ahead.

171
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:42,724
I saw a couple of comments about the yearbook.

172
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:53,246
And something I actually looked into and I noticed a couple of towns are doing this, Arlington being one of them, Stoneham being another one, is they're releasing the yearbook.

173
00:16:53,647 --> 00:16:59,108
And then in the fall, students are invited back for an addition to the yearbook.

174
00:16:59,128 --> 00:17:02,149
So obviously, yearbook might feel a little bit incomplete right now.

175
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:05,749
But a lot of schools are going with the option to give

176
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:17,646
um, like an addition to the yearbook free, um, if students pay for the yearbook, um, and get the schedule yearbook.

177
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:22,089
So that's something that, uh, that I saw the town were doing on Facebook.

178
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:29,653
I know it came up, like, are we looking at what other, um, places are doing not, uh, like instead of reinventing the wheel.

179
00:17:29,913 --> 00:17:36,216
And I, I did see that from, from Arlington specifically, they're releasing part of their yearbook and then another part of the yearbook.

180
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:37,417
So that's, that's an option.

181
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:47,175
Just to jump in on a question, we have had some discussion about a senior parade of what that would look like.

182
00:17:47,495 --> 00:17:54,138
I think we just, for doing it for the elementary schools, it's a little bit more manageable with the staff.

183
00:17:55,578 --> 00:18:02,602
There is talk, but we have to involve the police in order to shut down roads, things like that.

184
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:07,824
So that is an idea that we are kicking around as well of doing something as a parade.

185
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:22,429
around record around graduation time, if that's something that we can figure out, but it needs to have more outside agencies involved as well to make sure that it's handled correctly.

186
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:37,397
And again, you're talking a greater number of cars, you know, if you think about this about 300 students in the senior class, you know, and everybody takes a car that's

187
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:41,378
That's a big group going around Medford.

188
00:18:41,418 --> 00:18:44,260
So just want to keep that in mind as well.

189
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:53,524
And there's been talk about having parents doing the driving in place of that as well.

190
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,326
So there's a lot to think about.

191
00:18:56,346 --> 00:19:01,748
It is a very good idea, but it needs a lot of organization for it to come to fruition.

192
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,889
Not saying I don't want to do it.

193
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:07,491
I just want to make sure that we plan it correctly so that everyone's safe as well.

194
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:16,809
I want to put a question out about virtual versus live.

195
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:17,229
I think Ms.

196
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,732
Corrado had a great suggestion around looking at different communities.

197
00:19:21,313 --> 00:19:25,796
And you trial the internet, you see a lot of places are doing virtual activities.

198
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:34,423
But I'm reading, what I'm seeing here as a subtext is that our group here is looking for live and that seems to be more of a feel.

199
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:37,685
I'm just curious if any parents want to take a time to

200
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,962
come up with some thoughts virtual versus in person.

201
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,765
And if there are any virtual activities that you are interested in.

202
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:50,169
So Leanne Puccio, Leanna put out a question.

203
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,731
I don't know if we can post it because she has a very good point.

204
00:19:54,753 --> 00:19:58,736
You know, there are some students that would probably be heading out towards the military.

205
00:19:58,796 --> 00:20:01,318
So that's something to keep in mind.

206
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,643
You know, you know, unfortunately, again, we're kind of held hostage to when we can

207
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:09,155
kind of gather in a group again.

208
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,476
And that could be summer and that could be fall.

209
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:14,918
It just doesn't know when the ideal time is.

210
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:26,925
But I do want to put that out there that I do know that, especially as Mark mentioned, there's that future MHS 2002 group that I've followed.

211
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:34,489
And there are a few students that have put out that their intentions are to start their military enlistment.

212
00:20:36,963 --> 00:20:46,787
That's why I think the parade part may be good because that's something that we could get everybody involved before they need to go.

213
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:51,169
But again, who knows what happens with us getting together.

214
00:20:51,189 --> 00:21:02,253
Maybe it would be possible though to distribute

215
00:21:04,318 --> 00:21:16,027
the senior gifts sort of at the end of a senior parade, you know, I mean, that's something to think about too.

216
00:21:17,388 --> 00:21:27,556
You know, that if we were able to distribute cap and gowns so that seniors participated in that parade in their cap and gown,

217
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:33,568
And then at the end of the parade, every senior was given the senior gift.

218
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:39,273
I mean, that would be an option too.

219
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:47,580
So to answer Mr. Blount, to answer

220
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,483
Your question there, it looks like live seems to be more.

221
00:21:55,043 --> 00:22:02,370
But if it's not possible within a reasonable time, maybe considering a virtual alternative.

222
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:03,971
Just for those.

223
00:22:04,011 --> 00:22:10,837
I think just one thing I'm curious to hear from parents and students is if you are interested in having things happen sooner than later.

224
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:17,443
I think we all know if something happens sooner than later, it will have to be more virtual or more socially distanced.

225
00:22:18,956 --> 00:22:32,107
I'm looking at, we look ahead, it's late April, we look ahead and say, if there's something you'd like to see happen in May, and we probably know more or less what to expect in May, it's probably a little more along the lines of virtual or virtual hybrid.

226
00:22:32,447 --> 00:22:41,714
So I'm just curious what the thoughts are might be around that, where we're probably coming to a little more of a consensus around things that you do in person, hopefully summer or fall,

227
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:48,350
Um, again, just curious to see if anybody likes the idea of doing something sooner and the parade, uh, you know, I'm for it.

228
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:48,950
I like that idea.

229
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,831
It looks like a lot of folks.

230
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:59,233
Um, so a question I would like to throw out is if we had to do the fall, let's just say we had to do the fall.

231
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:01,674
You know, in my mind, there are two options.

232
00:23:01,854 --> 00:23:04,334
Obviously there's the Columbus day weekend.

233
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:07,755
And then there's the Thanksgiving day weekend.

234
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:11,436
My feeling is you get more on the Thanksgiving day weekend because a lot of

235
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:14,802
colleges and people are coming back home.

236
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:19,185
I'm not sure about Columbus day weekend in some cases.

237
00:23:19,245 --> 00:23:26,848
And I don't even know where all our students are going if they're going across country and can't get back at a certain time.

238
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:37,154
So if we were to do, this is just an F and I just need to know for myself, if people could comment of a preferred date, would you think of, um,

239
00:23:38,138 --> 00:23:43,680
If we can't do it in the summer, would Columbus Day be better or would Thanksgiving Day be better?

240
00:23:47,541 --> 00:23:48,382
Sooner than later.

241
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:57,485
Thanksgiving, I'm seeing Thanksgiving.

242
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:02,707
Thanksgiving.

243
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:12,333
A lot of teachers talked about this possibly becoming a homecoming-like event, and that definitely brings a very Thanksgiving kind of vibe.

244
00:24:12,653 --> 00:24:14,714
I can see where that's coming from.

245
00:24:15,114 --> 00:24:19,855
Yeah, I can tell you Thanksgiving seems to be the winner right now.

246
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:29,499
So that's good for us to kind of have a good direction of what to think about.

247
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:40,603
Yeah, I don't know if everyone can see that Thanksgiving keeps coming up.

248
00:24:44,786 --> 00:25:01,879
Can I also just toss out a question about, you know, what parents and students who are involved in athletics or activities or students who, you know, might be, might have been looking forward to, you know, some great athletic experiences or opportunities to be recognized for academic achievement.

249
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,702
You know, I feel like prom and graduation kind of end up as the big two.

250
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:10,015
But also we have, you know, traditional events where we honor kids' achievements.

251
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:15,237
And we are curious about your thoughts around how you might like to see your kids honored.

252
00:25:15,257 --> 00:25:27,161
You know, and there's, again, those are some things that maybe lend themselves to the possibility of virtual, whereas something like a graduation, you know, it seems like the feel is that that's better off live in some way.

253
00:25:27,841 --> 00:25:29,422
So again, give us your thoughts on that as well.

254
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:32,323
Other recognition, you know, activities for seniors.

255
00:25:41,032 --> 00:25:42,993
Okay, some good suggestions there so far.

256
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:57,524
You know, something else to throw out there as well, and this sort of resembles what's going up on the Parent Facebook page, what have you seen and read?

257
00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:02,147
You know, what are you learning about from your families, you know, in other places in the state or the country?

258
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:09,453
You know, what has struck you as a great idea, you know, now and later, because,

259
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:15,870
One thing that is happening, I suppose we're all reading a lot more news and we're probably seeing a number of these sorts of things.

260
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,531
So think about that too and give us your ideas.

261
00:26:19,132 --> 00:26:20,353
I like what Ms.

262
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:21,194
Corrado is saying.

263
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:24,697
Honors as a virtual event, make it like an Oscar night.

264
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,781
I couldn't be there to receive my Oscar in person.

265
00:26:32,643 --> 00:26:33,184
Give you an award.

266
00:26:34,349 --> 00:26:35,970
I actually like that idea a lot.

267
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:44,096
We can bring it up in our department meetings and see if other teachers would be into doing something like that.

268
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:51,362
I can see a lot of teachers putting together a video for everybody and then releasing it or doing it live.

269
00:26:52,082 --> 00:26:52,682
I like that idea.

270
00:26:53,083 --> 00:26:56,724
I mean, and the good news is we have the capabilities to do some high quality things like that.

271
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:58,705
You know, Bianca, I see you on the call.

272
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:01,667
Liana, you guys are part of that media technology team.

273
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:07,089
So we certainly could put together a very well produced event if we go that route.

274
00:27:07,349 --> 00:27:08,450
So I wrote that down.

275
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,270
Good ideas.

276
00:27:10,071 --> 00:27:18,975
So to answer Mrs. Miguel's question there, we're using this forum to actually kind of come up with some kind of survey too.

277
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:30,565
to send out, because we know that everybody can be part of this event, so that we have more data to go through what needs, well, where people are thinking.

278
00:27:32,126 --> 00:27:43,492
Again, this is kind of a forum start, but there's other planning that needs to go on, so exactly as soon as we review everything that we're talking about here, then we can come up with the correct questions for a survey.

279
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,622
I saw something come up about a survey.

280
00:27:47,662 --> 00:27:51,683
That's something that we talked about quite a bit in a couple of different meetings.

281
00:27:52,483 --> 00:27:56,384
I'm not sure what direction we want to go in with the next couple of questions.

282
00:27:56,424 --> 00:28:05,266
But I have a Google Doc open here, sort of creating a couple of potential survey questions if you guys want to go into doing some of that.

283
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:10,947
That option came up a few times in our meetings about releasing a survey.

284
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:13,868
So I thought this would be a good place to maybe generate some thoughts on that.

285
00:28:19,454 --> 00:28:25,917
Also, we just want to keep in mind, too, for us, that this is our first graduating class for our programming and web development students.

286
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:27,597
So we're going to want to make sure we do something.

287
00:28:27,978 --> 00:28:30,519
But we're already thinking about things we can do, whether it be virtual or not.

288
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,499
But it's a big year for us, too.

289
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,781
So if there's any people on the feed right now, we are thinking about that.

290
00:28:43,104 --> 00:28:48,646
So I also see, I don't know if Mr. Labar spoke to this, but there's students who are asking about getting into their lockers.

291
00:28:49,398 --> 00:28:54,040
And that is a question that I think that we'll have an answer sooner than later for.

292
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,343
I mean, again, we don't have, wish we could get clear cut answers on it.

293
00:28:58,423 --> 00:28:59,583
It's a totally logical thing.

294
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:02,245
Teachers wanna get in their rooms, kids wanna get in their lockers.

295
00:29:02,645 --> 00:29:04,246
There's valuable things in there.

296
00:29:04,986 --> 00:29:10,689
That's something that as soon as we know about that, some sort of way in, like with anything, it looks like we're gonna need to wait.

297
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,931
But listen, I mean, a lot of you have sent me an email about that asking.

298
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:17,112
And again, as soon as we know about how we can do that,

299
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:24,446
But that is a very logical concern, cleaning those out and getting your personal effects.

300
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:29,307
And, um, you know, I just want to put this on people's radars as well.

301
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:34,548
Um, where I know there are a lot of families that are willing to donate a lot of.

302
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:36,569
Finances to this.

303
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,889
There are also families that can't do that.

304
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:48,051
And the other part of it too, is, you know, I know that we could reach out to some businesses, but we also have to be mindful that businesses are struggling as well.

305
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:53,409
Um, so the finance piece of it is something that we do have to kind of plan out.

306
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:56,592
And again, it's not something I'm trying to be a downer on.

307
00:29:56,632 --> 00:30:07,640
I'm just trying to be a realist on, um, with, with, you know, with luck with graduation, I will say that we, we include that as a line item in our budget for the high school.

308
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:17,047
So that money has not been touched, uh, for graduation and can be, has been mentioned actually at the school committee to be used for graduation.

309
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:24,764
for next year, but depending on how much we have, I'm sure we can disperse some of that money differently, especially if we're going to go to Hormel.

310
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:29,326
But I do want people to kind of also keep in that mindset.

311
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:30,666
I understand fundraising.

312
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,187
I understand a lot of things.

313
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:39,410
I just want everyone to understand there's different sides to the coin, even when it comes to asking businesses right now.

314
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,448
from money to help support us.

315
00:30:41,528 --> 00:30:44,789
So just be mindful regarding that.

316
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,151
We'll obviously keep everyone in the loop regarding our finances and where we're going.

317
00:30:50,211 --> 00:30:56,073
I know like the senior class activities fund has a line in it.

318
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:59,254
I have the graduation line in the budget there as well.

319
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:07,236
So it's something that we can figure out, but costs of things can get a little bit pricey.

320
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,457
I know people wanna do the,

321
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:22,185
the banners on the light poles, I can tell you, you know, the cost of that, if you're thinking of 300 students, is going to be astronomical in a lot of ways.

322
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:26,447
And we can say that we can help everybody, but we have to be realistic too.

323
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,528
So again, I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer.

324
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:35,912
I'm just trying to kind of put everyone in the mindset of, you know, there is cost to these things as well that we need to be considerate of.

325
00:31:52,123 --> 00:31:55,746
So it sounds like Mr. Donlan is collecting survey questions.

326
00:31:56,366 --> 00:32:01,750
So something else that parents and students can consider is if you have a suggestion about what to survey.

327
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:08,394
For example, surveying would people want to make a donation or surveying kids about their priority activities.

328
00:32:09,738 --> 00:32:16,064
you know, or ideas that we have found to really stand out here, you know, such as the idea of a parade or signs.

329
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:24,351
So just something else to think about, you know, that we might want to be serving because it looks like that is something that we'll take as a next step in creating that survey.

330
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,082
And just so everybody knows, I'm writing down.

331
00:32:28,102 --> 00:32:32,384
You can't see me writing, and I have a Google Doc open on the side.

332
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:35,986
But I'm collecting just some of the notes from on the side.

333
00:32:36,006 --> 00:32:42,690
So if you write something and submit it, but we don't talk about it immediately, I've never used this app before.

334
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,011
I'm not sure if it saves.

335
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:49,674
But I'm collecting a lot of the ideas that come up on the side panel if you guys write things.

336
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:51,015
And I have a lot so far.

337
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,616
I should just let you guys know.

338
00:32:54,555 --> 00:33:02,317
One of the comments just to jump in on it was, could we have one large banner printed and hung over the square?

339
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:16,722
I mean, that we can explore getting that done and that might be something that the class funds could field.

340
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,102
So- That's what actually sent me the

341
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:27,289
The photo that we do by my office up above of everybody.

342
00:33:27,689 --> 00:33:31,230
Yeah So I I have that photo.

343
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,470
I just have how we're going.

344
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:50,614
It's got to get edited a little bit and understand to He was bringing up to me that the resolution the bigger you go could get tight in a lot of ways, but I think what I like about that photo is that has a group of students and

345
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:52,420
Yeah, it does.

346
00:33:52,721 --> 00:34:00,688
So that's something that I have in the works of thinking about, too, that we can talk about further.

347
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:08,716
OK.

348
00:34:10,337 --> 00:34:11,258
Someone else.

349
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:13,921
There's some comments here about, oh, go ahead, Nancy.

350
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:14,221
I'm sorry.

351
00:34:15,184 --> 00:34:31,217
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but someone's commented that about holding the parade and that celebration, anticipating that the prom and graduation may take a little while.

352
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:39,944
So, I mean, I think that, I mean, I think there's just a,

353
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:51,722
a strong feeling that we should do something sooner than later and not put everything off till summer or fall.

354
00:34:52,402 --> 00:35:03,865
So maybe we could simultaneously think about the parade, the banner, senior gifts, and then for summer or fall, prom and graduation.

355
00:35:05,285 --> 00:35:14,551
And the thing with the parade is, and I saw this mentioned too, and I guess that was the same with my vision, is they could wear their caps and gowns in their cars.

356
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:21,815
At least showing that this is the reason of the whole parade as well.

357
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:30,160
And I think, I know Mr. Leyva said this, but just to let you know, the caps and gowns, they arrived weeks ago.

358
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,161
They're in the building.

359
00:35:31,181 --> 00:35:32,241
I mean, they are

360
00:35:33,779 --> 00:35:36,080
It'd be great to get those to the kids sooner than later.

361
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,040
That's one tangible thing that we have.

362
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,340
I wanna respond to a question.

363
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:55,964
I think somebody mentioned around if students, if we were looking into lawn signs or the like and students have a residential setting where they don't have a lawn or they're in a multifamily building or an apartment building that perhaps we could discuss some sort of sign that can go open the windows.

364
00:35:56,764 --> 00:35:59,785
At least that way there is a consistent outlook to that.

365
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:00,905
So I appreciate that suggestion.

366
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:01,845
I think we definitely need to

367
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:06,039
you know, look at where our students reside and be sure that we reach out to everybody.

368
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,020
And, you know, I think we can commit to that sort of thing.

369
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,801
So just to respond to that idea.

370
00:36:10,622 --> 00:36:26,691
You know, I like, I saw our, uh, Mr. Conley's idea of, of, you know, if we can get the photos, the yearbook photos that were taken, um, and run them through, uh, T just the TV station, you know, at least having those pictures cycled through.

371
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:30,093
I think that would be a good another way of, um,

372
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,431
connecting for the seniors as well.

373
00:36:39,756 --> 00:36:49,704
Is there perhaps if Miss Evangelista, I could step out if she wants to jump in to give us any info around cable TV, getting graduation pictures up or that sort of thing.

374
00:36:49,724 --> 00:36:52,506
I'll step out in case you do want to come in Lisa.

375
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,876
So I'll just jump in for a quick second.

376
00:37:09,116 --> 00:37:14,286
The parents are welcome to send to info at medford.k12.ma.us.

377
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:20,016
Um, we're going to be posting, we've got about 10 of them in so far.

378
00:37:20,437 --> 00:37:23,219
We're creating a backdrop to put in the senior picture.

379
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:36,469
If you guys want to send some accomplishments, where your child's going, their best memory, um, something along those ideas, we'll start posting the Facebook and then we'll start sending them over to our, to the Medford community media site as well.

380
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,911
Um, we'll be happy to do that for you.

381
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:46,237
Um, we want to make this as awesome as possible, given how bad the situation is for our seniors.

382
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:55,807
So I'm going to step out again, but just so you guys know, it's info at medford.k12.ma.us, and I will post that in the comments.

383
00:37:56,267 --> 00:38:10,176
Please send a picture, a couple of accomplishments, and what your child's next plans are, maybe like their best memory of Medford High School, Medford Vocational, Curtis Tufts, or wherever they want from their time at Medford Public Schools.

384
00:38:14,909 --> 00:38:42,334
Well, it looks like a great deal of some wonderful suggestions and ideas that I think we definitely can weave into a survey, get it out to people, and then synthesize recommendations and what people are thinking, and then try and tie them as best we can to what we can do right now in terms of the virus.

385
00:38:43,752 --> 00:38:51,004
But as I'm looking on the side, there's just a great number of wonderful suggestions.

386
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:05,147
Like someone is suggesting Mr. Fallon, the media tech students.

387
00:39:05,287 --> 00:39:07,629
I'll assume you have no students in the building.

388
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:08,369
Is that right?

389
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,851
No, there's no students in there, but there's a lot that can be done remotely.

390
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:15,974
And they've actually been meeting frequently with the teacher, Patrick reached out.

391
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:20,537
So I think we really do have the benefit of that program because they can work.

392
00:39:20,677 --> 00:39:22,298
A lot of them can do, you know, they can work remotely.

393
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:24,899
So I'm encouraged by the comments.

394
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,761
And yes, I agree, Angela, for sure.

395
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:27,581
Okay.

396
00:39:27,781 --> 00:39:28,802
Same with you, Nancy, I agree.

397
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,345
I'm seeing a lot of people talking about when some of these events would occur, either in the summer or the fall.

398
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:46,813
So just for the survey purposes, I hope this isn't coming off as an either or with some of these events or some of the decisions that we make.

399
00:39:48,394 --> 00:39:52,437
we're going to try to hold events as we can.

400
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:57,822
The problem is that we're at the mercy of when we can hold events and open things up.

401
00:39:59,203 --> 00:40:02,566
And also, we want to make sure that it's accessible for everyone.

402
00:40:02,726 --> 00:40:08,591
If it's late, late in the summer and a lot of kids are going off to school and college, then that changes things a little bit.

403
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:12,254
But of course, I think this is the beginning of us really figuring this out.

404
00:40:12,774 --> 00:40:13,134
together.

405
00:40:13,154 --> 00:40:18,379
We want to make sure that it's something that everybody can go to, or at least a majority of students can go to.

406
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,100
Right.

407
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:29,048
And, you know, again, not to be a downer, but we are at the mercy of when it is safe to gather again.

408
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:33,512
And I don't want to say that I don't just don't know when that is.

409
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:34,753
If it's in the summer, great.

410
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:37,195
We'll move towards the summer.

411
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,837
But, you know, I can't speculate

412
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:42,092
you know, when those will be.

413
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:51,595
But I think, like you said, Mr. Donilon, if we have at least an idea of which direction people are going, we're going to shoot for either or.

414
00:40:53,196 --> 00:41:05,901
But again, please note that, you know, I just don't want to promise something that can't be delivered because the higher ups above the school have a different vision of when we'll be able to gather again.

415
00:41:07,037 --> 00:41:08,598
And we want to make sure that we do this right.

416
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:24,231
I think one of the challenges that came up when earlier in the spring when we were discussing the prom was, even if we did go back to school, which obviously the news kind of changed our narrative on that, would we still be able to hold the prom at the same date?

417
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:29,335
So just something to consider, you know, it generally takes us a long time to get word out.

418
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:36,697
to really plan an event and sell tickets and make sure all of the boxes are checked off.

419
00:41:36,737 --> 00:41:39,498
So these events do take considerable planning.

420
00:41:39,518 --> 00:41:45,480
I definitely wouldn't expect if all of a sudden the news were to say, okay, events are open again, us to have an event that weekend.

421
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,862
It takes us a while to make sure that we plan and can communicate with everybody accordingly.

422
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:16,686
I mean, just to piggyback on that, it might just be prudent to plan backwards so that we don't run into a situation where we're yet again planning events that we're not going to be able to pull off because of the social distancing.

423
00:42:17,227 --> 00:42:24,789
So I think late summer, early fall, I mean, those sound like they're doable.

424
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:27,837
you know, timeframes.

425
00:42:28,878 --> 00:42:43,239
And I think also that if we were to do our senior parade, I think we probably could get that set up simultaneously to the time that our seniors would have been graduating.

426
00:42:44,085 --> 00:43:02,679
which would be kind of nice that so that would sort of sort of hold those that time frame and that sounds like that would be the kind of enthusiasm and joy from the whole Bedford community that I think our students very much need to feel.

427
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:02,739
So

428
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:10,346
But let's get the survey out.

429
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:14,267
Let's get it out to as many people as we possibly can.

430
00:43:14,287 --> 00:43:33,872
I mean, all ideas will be valued and we'll share the results with everybody and start to pare it down and let people know what we're looking at.

431
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:38,441
Mark, do you want to add anything to that?

432
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:43,424
He's radio silence.

433
00:43:43,524 --> 00:43:48,728
He's got some audio things going on.

434
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:58,676
I just want to also let people know that we have ordered the diplomas.

435
00:43:58,716 --> 00:44:05,101
The only thing that we didn't do was put the dates on them deliberately because we wanted to make sure that

436
00:44:06,267 --> 00:44:10,350
whatever date is decided that that date is what's there.

437
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,332
So we do have that as well.

438
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:26,422
I think we could keep going, but I think as a group, and if this group agrees with me, I think we've sort of expressed what we want.

439
00:44:26,462 --> 00:44:28,464
It looks like we're getting a lot of feedback.

440
00:44:29,044 --> 00:44:35,289
I think the next step in my mind is that we come up with that survey, we distribute that survey,

441
00:44:36,087 --> 00:44:46,091
you know, we could come back together again and share that survey out and then move forward in a direction that is based off of what people are thinking.

442
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:50,813
That sounds like a plan.

443
00:44:50,893 --> 00:45:03,998
And in the meantime, I would be happy to work with you, Paul or David and Mr. Donlon and Mr. Fallon to figure out what would the logistics of a senior parade

444
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:06,343
have to look like.

445
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:17,175
Because I think if we decided to add that to the other plans, then we would need to sort of have some of that information sooner than later.

446
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:21,197
So this is from Mark.

447
00:45:21,237 --> 00:45:24,660
You can just give us a thumbs up if you're having trouble with the audio.

448
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:32,326
I know we've had a lot of success, at least the class officers have, reaching the students with the media.

449
00:45:32,346 --> 00:45:41,793
So what we thought we could possibly do is maybe send a copy of the survey early to you, and you can put together a poll on Instagram or something like that.

450
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:43,754
Is that doable, Mark?

451
00:45:47,262 --> 00:45:48,003
I don't know.

452
00:45:48,683 --> 00:45:50,284
Yeah.

453
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,546
You know what?

454
00:45:53,706 --> 00:45:54,867
You know what, Mr. Don?

455
00:45:54,987 --> 00:45:59,490
We did that earlier in the year, so I know they have the capacity to do that.

456
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:03,513
Yeah, it went through a Google form, and it was a great response.

457
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:05,154
And we got a great response.

458
00:46:05,254 --> 00:46:10,217
So we have the, they've done that really, really successfully a couple of times.

459
00:46:10,277 --> 00:46:11,038
So let's do it.

460
00:46:11,098 --> 00:46:13,399
That sounds, that sounds good.

461
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,912
Okay, so I've seen a lot.

462
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:23,372
I think we do what we said.

463
00:46:23,412 --> 00:46:24,133
We'll compile.

464
00:46:24,173 --> 00:46:27,314
We'll definitely message out when we'll meet again.

465
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:30,715
And, you know, that's not going to be late.

466
00:46:33,015 --> 00:46:34,676
It's going to be, you know, sooner.

467
00:46:34,696 --> 00:46:37,357
Okay, there's a lot of questions about the last day of school.

468
00:46:37,457 --> 00:46:38,917
I can't give you that answer right now.

469
00:46:40,018 --> 00:46:42,639
That answer has to be discussed with the superintendent.

470
00:46:42,739 --> 00:46:43,839
So we're in works on it.

471
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:50,852
So I know that people want to know, but as of right now, this meeting was intended for senior events.

472
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:55,213
We'll get into the other logisticals of when the last day for seniors will be soon.

473
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,014
So you'll hear from me soon about that.

474
00:47:01,314 --> 00:47:02,495
Thumbs up, we're good to go?

475
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:10,456
It's awesome to see the kind of support and enthusiasm for our seniors.

476
00:47:10,556 --> 00:47:13,677
And it's just heartwarming to know that what we planned

477
00:47:14,178 --> 00:47:16,961
the community will help us pull off.

478
00:47:17,101 --> 00:47:23,006
So that's, I mean, I feel even more hopeful than I did already, to be honest.

479
00:47:23,286 --> 00:47:23,947
So it's good.

480
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:28,691
And I just want to, one last time, obviously thank everybody.

481
00:47:28,711 --> 00:47:31,274
We definitely miss you.

482
00:47:31,394 --> 00:47:32,175
I miss you too.

483
00:47:32,195 --> 00:47:35,758
I miss the kids, but I miss the many of the parents too, who've gotten to know over the years.

484
00:47:36,496 --> 00:47:38,878
You know, and I think that let's keep things going on that Facebook page.

485
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:43,161
And maybe what you can do is try to invite a friend or neighbor who you know is not on it.

486
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:46,503
Let's try to get as many of the parents as possible on that page.

487
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:49,065
So that way you can continue to use that as a forum.

488
00:47:49,665 --> 00:47:54,249
And I just know from the, you know, from the brain bank, I mean, all of us are smarter than one of us.

489
00:47:54,829 --> 00:48:03,776
So, you know, we take all those ideas, we keep shaping and coming up with things that we think are really good, you know, respect our kids and the work you've done too.

490
00:48:04,096 --> 00:48:05,557
You know, this is a long time coming.

491
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:10,203
especially for those of you who've been with us in Medford from the very beginning.

492
00:48:10,283 --> 00:48:13,984
And I know there's a lot of people who have a lot of interest in trying to do this right.

493
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:18,086
Okay, so keep the ideas coming and I appreciate it.

494
00:48:18,126 --> 00:48:19,806
Thank you for hearing what I had to say.

495
00:48:19,826 --> 00:48:22,287
You can email me too if you have some questions or thoughts.

496
00:48:22,307 --> 00:48:24,188
Okay, thanks everyone.

497
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:27,049
Thank you and thank you families and students as well.

498
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:28,310
I see all the thank yous.

499
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,351
We really appreciate your input.

500
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:33,392
And again, we're gonna keep this ball rolling, so stay tuned.

501
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:34,884
Thank you everybody.

502
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:35,985
Nice to see you all.

503
00:48:36,005 --> 00:48:37,426
I want to thank you for this.

504
00:48:37,506 --> 00:48:54,316
We are just, you know, we're going to work this for the eighth grade in the future, but our focus is really making sure that the class of 2020 gets the respect and the dignity that they deserve after 13 years of hard work getting to this point as they move on to that next milestone, whatever it may be.

505
00:48:55,595 --> 00:48:57,536
So ladies and gentlemen, keep your ideas coming.

506
00:48:57,936 --> 00:49:11,140
Please send a picture of your child, your child's name, plans for next year, and maybe a memory or something else, some of their accomplishments, while at Medford Public Schools to info at medford.k12.ma.us.

507
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,322
And I just want to thank everybody for being here and any feedback is good feedback.

508
00:49:16,442 --> 00:49:20,043
So we're going to end the broadcast now and thank you everyone.

509
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:21,083
Thank you.

510
00:49:21,443 --> 00:49:21,923
Thank you.

511
00:49:21,943 --> 00:49:23,364
Bye everybody.

512
00:49:23,384 --> 00:49:24,024
Bye.
