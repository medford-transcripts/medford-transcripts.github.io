1
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:18,925
Tonight, we have to thank my team.

2
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,086
There's so many of them, but I want to thank everybody that's here.

3
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:22,928
If you're from all Medford, if you could just raise your hand.

4
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,509
Just thanking you for being here tonight and helping.

5
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:26,810
Thank you so much.

6
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,021
We've had a few events.

7
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:33,662
I know tonight's a tough, tough night.

8
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:42,126
I know that we had about three different events tonight, but we said we need to do something because things are happening really quick.

9
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:48,609
And the reason that we're here is because we wanted to talk about the Proposition 2.5 override and the debt exclusion.

10
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:51,890
So there are three questions that will be on the ballot.

11
00:00:52,816 --> 00:00:57,719
I'll give you some more information later on after a few people speak.

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:05,584
But one is the debt exclusion, which is for a new fire headquarters.

13
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:10,748
I'm very fortunate that we have one of our union leaders from the fire department.

14
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:12,529
Danielle Masolino is going to be here.

15
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:13,629
She's going to speak in a little while.

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:21,635
And proud to say someone that I called and asked his opinion because I think he is probably

17
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:27,282
the smartest educational mind, at least in Massachusetts.

18
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:28,703
He's someone that I respect.

19
00:01:29,483 --> 00:01:33,984
And sad to say, I don't think people respect him enough until that person's gone.

20
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:38,285
But I called this gentleman and I asked him some questions.

21
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:45,687
And within five minutes, you just feel better because he just educates you with his knowledge.

22
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:50,269
And I asked him if he can come out and spend a Friday night to come out and speak and

23
00:01:51,328 --> 00:02:14,223
give his opinion and what, you know, his perspective as an educational leader, someone that ran our school system for many, many years, still works at the state level, high level at the state, and he's gonna share some of his knowledge, and then we'll fill in some gaps that people had that had some questions, and we can help educate everybody so they understand what this means on November 7th.

24
00:02:14,263 --> 00:02:17,826
So right now, I'd like to introduce my friend Roy Belson.

25
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:20,629
Nice to see everybody.

26
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:23,672
Thank you for giving me an opportunity to say a few things.

27
00:02:24,473 --> 00:02:31,540
And hopefully, what I express will help you understand what's going on.

28
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:43,571
Obviously, I'm here to share my perspectives and my thoughts about the upcoming questions on the November ballot, especially those that affect public education.

29
00:02:44,764 --> 00:03:03,080
So while I'm no longer the superintendent of schools, I'm in my seventh year of retirement or semi-retirement, I still stay very aware of education items, both in the community, the state, nation, and it's very enlightening to see what people are doing around the commonwealth.

30
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:09,646
I spent 50 years in Medford public education, 23 years as superintendent,

31
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:18,336
And I also served at different times as the budget director, the curriculum director, and the personnel administrator, as well as a teacher.

32
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:22,579
So I care deeply about what happens in our schools and our community.

33
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,521
I'm not here tonight to criticize the school administration.

34
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,962
I know how hard they work.

35
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:30,724
I know the challenges that they face.

36
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:35,187
And I know that some of the things are beyond their control.

37
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:51,473
I have always believed, and I still do, that schools deserve solid levels of funding and that the budget process must promote and support quality programming, stability, and predictability.

38
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:56,075
Budget development must be resourceful and creative.

39
00:03:56,755 --> 00:04:02,558
It should not be a destabilizing force, exercise, and create uncertainty and conflict.

40
00:04:02,858 --> 00:04:05,039
And I think that's what's happened in the last couple of years.

41
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:22,515
Yes, there will be from time to time differences among officials, educators, constituents, but at all times, they should be based on the facts, on available resources, best practices, and the needs of students and their families, as well as the community at large.

42
00:04:24,116 --> 00:04:32,562
The current override ballot questions, initiatives, and two of them in education, and one, a debt exclusion for the fire department,

43
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:37,827
Call for, if you will, in the school department, a $7 million hike.

44
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:41,929
You had a half a million dollars for the DPW at 7.5.

45
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,191
This is a property tax levy.

46
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:54,877
This request is based upon the argument that the school system has been perpetually in a structural deficit, and it's not true.

47
00:04:56,438 --> 00:05:00,823
Pertinent questions are these is it true that it's we're in a deficit.

48
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,986
How does Medford compare with other communities around us?

49
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:06,909
Are there good alternatives?

50
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:15,617
available to meet our needs Is this a one-time request or will there be another one a larger request in the near future?

51
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:16,999
And I think you know the answer to that

52
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:21,196
What is the real impact on the Medford taxpayer?

53
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,438
And does the voting public truly understand the pros and cons?

54
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:31,442
And has there been sufficient information and time for the public to make an informed decision?

55
00:05:32,402 --> 00:05:35,244
So let's take a look and let's consider the following.

56
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:43,489
The last two years relied heavily on the use of federal ARPA and ESSER funds.

57
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:46,591
They were put out there because of the COVID crisis.

58
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:56,745
It was well known that when these funds were used up, there would be a need for the city to sustain staff and programs with local and state revenues.

59
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:03,810
Otherwise, there would be undesirable cuts to program and personnel.

60
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,352
So was this necessary?

61
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:15,298
When the budget process took place in the last year, everybody knew that those funds had to be replaced.

62
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:25,205
And those funds enabled the city to build up a free cash reserve that is three times what has ever been in place.

63
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,208
Almost at this point in time, $35 million.

64
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:36,312
And if that was the case, was it necessary?

65
00:06:36,332 --> 00:06:43,156
And did the mayor really fail to provide full funding consistent with the school committee's request?

66
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:51,583
when there's a significant amount of free cash available to the city, much higher than the amount available in previous years.

67
00:06:52,783 --> 00:07:03,328
The school administration by law is required to ask, and the school committee as well, for an amount sufficient to support the schools under Proposition 2 1⁄2.

68
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,169
It's their legal request to do that.

69
00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:14,112
The mayor or the city manager in the past, when 2 1⁄2 passed, had the bottom line, and the city council

70
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:18,685
can only approve or cut what the mayor provides.

71
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,346
So it's not simple.

72
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:30,750
The amount of money reported to DOR of free cash was $25 million in 2004.

73
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:37,812
And as I indicated, they added another $9 million or thereabouts in the current fiscal year.

74
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:43,414
Why, given the often repeated

75
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:48,759
mantra of the mayor, transparency.

76
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:51,599
Interesting word.

77
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:04,744
And the city's financial director, that they failed to provide a clean and complete report on the city's financial position to the city council and the school committee.

78
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:06,565
I think the answer's simple.

79
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:12,767
The answer is that they wanted to leverage a crisis to create

80
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,133
a need for an override.

81
00:08:16,354 --> 00:08:26,596
Because you're in a situation where you don't have it, you're threatening cuts to important services, and if you don't give me the money, we're gonna have to do drastic measures.

82
00:08:27,476 --> 00:08:28,776
This is not Proposition 2 1⁄2.

83
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:33,537
In 1981, 1982, I was in the school system.

84
00:08:34,257 --> 00:08:36,138
I was working with the superintendent's office.

85
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:39,698
And the budget of the city of Medford for the schools was $19.4 million.

86
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:46,762
That year, we had to cut $3.2 million.

87
00:08:47,122 --> 00:08:49,264
That's a cut.

88
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,126
150 people got laid off.

89
00:08:52,747 --> 00:08:55,469
That was difficult, very difficult.

90
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,352
We are not in that situation right now.

91
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:00,253
We are not in that situation.

92
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:07,720
When the 2024 DOR, Department of Revenue Tax Recap Report is studied, and I did that,

93
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:16,585
There are clear underestimates of revenue amounts when compared with 2023, specifically by almost 15%.

94
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:30,851
So in other words saying, if investment income was X, it was 14% less when they were projecting their revenue, almost $18 million.

95
00:09:33,392 --> 00:09:34,853
Why create a crisis?

96
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:44,920
Before you ask the public for an override, should you not first use the obvious resources available?

97
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,702
You can always go back later on and say, you know, we used up our resources.

98
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,703
But when you have them, why won't you use them?

99
00:09:57,204 --> 00:09:58,444
Let's talk about the tax rate.

100
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,424
The Medford tax rate is low.

101
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:05,988
The residential tax rate is low comparatively to area communities.

102
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:07,349
Nothing wrong with that.

103
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:12,973
I don't think anyone feels like it has to be number one, the highest tax rate in the Commonwealth.

104
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:18,277
So it's not a bad thing when affordability for housing and other needs is challenging.

105
00:10:19,739 --> 00:10:25,783
If the overrides and debt exclusion pass, taxes will increase, I think, by at least 10%.

106
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:34,177
especially when you include the 2.5% statutory increase that happens virtually every year.

107
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,459
And what about the impact of re-evaluation?

108
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:41,300
You know what's going on right now, they're checking your houses out.

109
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,383
And by the way, if you haven't noticed, your house is worth more than it was when you bought it, in most cases.

110
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:52,885
And when they reassess it, they're gonna reassess it and the taxes are gonna go up.

111
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:57,867
And on top of that, you're probably gonna pay a little bit more for water and sewer,

112
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:05,165
And when you add it all together, if you have to take an equity loan, you're gonna pay a hell of a lot more interest than you might like.

113
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:18,613
And if you're a new person wanting to buy a home, the mortgage rates are still at 6.2%, and even if it goes down to 5%, it's a hell of a lot higher than it was when people refinanced a few years ago.

114
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:21,374
And what about renters?

115
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,776
Some of these people will never have a chance.

116
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:27,478
They just won't be able to

117
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,642
to get in and the landlords are going to pass on the rent to their tenants.

118
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,362
So, that affects people too.

119
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:43,424
When you think about it, there's also a deduction, tax deduction limit.

120
00:11:44,225 --> 00:11:48,906
You used to be able to take your income tax and your house property tax and interest.

121
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:51,047
You can't do that anymore in the current rule.

122
00:11:52,027 --> 00:11:56,108
So, you can't even deduct some of the stuff that you used to be able to do before.

123
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:58,209
Some people can get around it for various reasons,

124
00:11:59,011 --> 00:11:59,651
Not everybody.

125
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:07,733
If you look at the age factor in the community, 22% of Medford residents are over the age of 60.

126
00:12:08,213 --> 00:12:13,534
14% are 70 or more.

127
00:12:13,594 --> 00:12:16,134
A lot of these people are on fixed incomes.

128
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:19,695
They don't have another alternative to go to.

129
00:12:20,455 --> 00:12:24,956
And they're probably supporting their children, their grandchildren, and everything else like that as well.

130
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:27,777
So a hit like this is really significant.

131
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:45,512
By the way, as the high school project moves forward, and it's in the planning stage right now, undoubtedly there will be another override request, which isn't out there right now.

132
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:49,114
That'll make three override requests.

133
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:56,278
The two that are there now, and the one that might come up, plus the debt exclusion, in the very near future.

134
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,740
Given the cost of a rebuild,

135
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:06,239
or renovation, this will be the biggest number that you've ever seen.

136
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:12,424
The SBA reimbursement rate is not known at this time.

137
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:14,826
It will only cover certain costs.

138
00:13:14,886 --> 00:13:15,987
Not everything is eligible.

139
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:28,998
If you look at high schools that have been built or renovated in recent times, you're talking somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million to $400 million to redo the high school.

140
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:34,193
We've got vocational shops and other things like that that have to be preserved.

141
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:37,413
That's an expensive thing.

142
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:50,116
And if you maybe get 35, 40%, not getting the 90% that we got for the schools, the K through 12 schools that we got several years ago with Rick as the chairperson of the building committee at that time.

143
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:55,557
And we, by the way, sold the old schools so that we actually made money.

144
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:56,797
Don't tell anybody.

145
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,961
You don't get that now.

146
00:14:02,061 --> 00:14:11,388
So you're gonna be talking about potentially 100 to $200 million of local assessment, over and above.

147
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:19,775
That will impact taxes on top of the early override assessments.

148
00:14:21,296 --> 00:14:25,439
And by the way, if the override passes in November,

149
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:31,564
you will see the increase on your January 2025 tax bill.

150
00:14:32,144 --> 00:14:36,506
You're not gonna wait a year to build it up, you're gonna see it in January.

151
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:38,367
It's only a few months away.

152
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:47,032
Now one of the arguments that comes around is that somehow Medford salaries and cost per pupil are not competitive.

153
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:53,736
Now as a educator, I think I started off with this, I want every nickel I can get for the schools.

154
00:14:54,815 --> 00:15:00,337
I mean, I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I think the schools deserve every nickel we can give them.

155
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:02,337
And we have plenty of needs.

156
00:15:03,558 --> 00:15:05,198
But no one gets everything they want.

157
00:15:06,178 --> 00:15:07,939
And no school system is able to do that.

158
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,579
And no community is able to do that.

159
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,300
But let's take a look at the Medford Public Schools financials.

160
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:19,122
And this is according to the latest Department of Elementary and Secondary Education statistics.

161
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:21,603
The state average per pupil

162
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:22,652
is $19,714.

163
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,672
Medford is currently spending $21,372.

164
00:15:24,712 --> 00:15:25,353
Arlington is spending $18,615.

165
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:27,233
Malden is spending $17,428.

166
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:28,333
Melrose is spending $15,540.

167
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:28,973
Peabody is spending $16,996.

168
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,294
And I can go on and on.

169
00:15:52,850 --> 00:16:03,999
Now, someone can say, well, there are, Mystic Valley, by the way, one of the charter schools that sucks away dollars from our budget, is paying, is spending $14,167.

170
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:14,867
Now, there are places, Somerville, 23,958, we just built a building so you can see where that's involved.

171
00:16:15,248 --> 00:16:18,290
And by the way, if you wanna chase Cambridge, Cambridge is spending $36,712.

172
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:24,995
Of course, Cambridge has got a property base that's incredible.

173
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:26,716
And Burlington is $25,297.

174
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:35,341
And by the way, if we were still sending kids to Minuteman, the cost would be $34,176.

175
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:46,127
And if we continued to send 50 kids there like we did when we cut it off, we'd be pushing $2 million a year.

176
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:49,697
of money out of our pocket.

177
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:52,558
And that's why we rebuilt the vocational school.

178
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,619
And people argued about, why are you not sending the kids to Minuteman?

179
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,220
Because they're sucking dollars out of Medford.

180
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,462
And we had a right to rebuild our own school and run our own programs at a far less cost.

181
00:17:06,023 --> 00:17:08,784
So then the question comes about teacher salaries.

182
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:09,685
Where's Charlene?

183
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:10,505
Charlene, the room boy.

184
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:12,906
All right, Charlene, don't take offense.

185
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:15,667
OK.

186
00:17:17,085 --> 00:17:24,833
If you look at the average salary for the Medford teachers, average salary, and this is latest numbers, obviously it's gone up a little bit.

187
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:26,654
The average salary is $88,179.

188
00:17:26,694 --> 00:17:27,535
That's the statistic.

189
00:17:27,595 --> 00:17:32,320
If you're on the top step, 10 years, a master's plus 60, this year fiscal 25, you're gonna make $111,000.

190
00:17:42,065 --> 00:17:44,645
In Arlington, the top salary is $83,466.

191
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:45,766
I mean the average salary.

192
00:17:45,786 --> 00:17:46,106
Melrose is $76,369.

193
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:46,766
Beverly is $84,765.

194
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:47,226
Malden is $83,366.

195
00:17:47,406 --> 00:17:48,286
Marblehead is $84,365.

196
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:49,686
Mystic Valley, their charter school, is at $73,823.

197
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:51,407
Prospect Hill at $78, another charter school.

198
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:52,647
And so on and so forth.

199
00:18:11,502 --> 00:18:19,766
Our teachers deserve good pay, but they don't leave because they can make $2,000 or $3,000 more in another community.

200
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:23,548
They leave because they're afraid they might get their job cut.

201
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,210
They leave because they don't have good benefits.

202
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,392
And in Medford, health benefits and other benefits contractually are outstanding.

203
00:18:32,553 --> 00:18:38,716
There are a lot of reasons why people stay in the Medford public schools or come to us, because our benefits are good,

204
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:44,470
very good, by the way, and our salary is competitive.

205
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:48,952
There is a teacher shortage in the country, so, you know, Medford's gonna be affected by that.

206
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:53,913
There are a lot of people not going into education right now because they're feeling that it's too challenging.

207
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:57,695
But people will stay with us for stability.

208
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:02,876
So the argument that somehow we're not competitive is not real.

209
00:19:04,617 --> 00:19:07,338
Now, what are the alternatives besides free cash?

210
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:10,595
Well, first of all, Medford's new growth is in the tank.

211
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:16,816
We're on any building permits currently in place at City Hall right now.

212
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:22,957
And unless you're really big on a beer haul, that's the only thing that I know about.

213
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:26,918
How much are we leaving on the table?

214
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,359
How can we grow the tax base rather than increase taxes on residents?

215
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:33,920
We're not doing it.

216
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,440
We're not doing it.

217
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:43,329
Don't penalize the school system operations by building up huge reserves in free cash.

218
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,331
Don't underestimate revenues.

219
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:48,993
Let's strive for affordability.

220
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:57,617
And in the request for the override, there's these general categories, teacher salaries, this, that, and the other thing.

221
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,379
Be specific.

222
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,860
The people who are voting for this

223
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:07,002
are voting against it need to know where every dollar is going.

224
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:14,608
They don't want to just hear it's going into a tank someplace that hopefully will support the kinds of things that we consider to be important.

225
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:17,570
General categories don't cut it.

226
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:22,033
The override vote is less than two months away.

227
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:26,997
And residents, citizens, are already voting.

228
00:20:27,037 --> 00:20:28,458
They're going to start voting very soon.

229
00:20:29,639 --> 00:20:32,882
So besides the general information on the web, of the city's web,

230
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:37,945
What does the average citizen know about the need and the impact?

231
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,186
Probably not a lot.

232
00:20:41,468 --> 00:20:52,076
Many of you will vote by mail at the general election, or the president and senator, and local races are at a minimum.

233
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:58,040
So there aren't a lot of people who might even come out, because, you know, they'll vote for the president and that's it.

234
00:20:59,642 --> 00:21:01,723
The Secretary of State, I'm going to pull this out.

235
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:03,524
Most of you probably got this.

236
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:07,646
Secretary of State sends out this every year, every year there's an election.

237
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:15,469
And in it, not only are the candidates identified, but the ballot issues, there's five ballot issues statewide.

238
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:32,459
They're identified with pros and cons and research so that you as a voter can actually decide based on some information based on partisans born against and research whether to vote for a particular item.

239
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,621
I haven't seen anything in this city that would even comes close to that.

240
00:21:39,322 --> 00:21:46,385
You have a lot of people who will go in there that day and they will not know the impact of what they're doing.

241
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:51,512
Some of them will think they're voting for $7 million for a new high school.

242
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,393
They're gonna be surprised.

243
00:21:55,975 --> 00:21:57,235
Many will vote by mail.

244
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:08,302
So, is this the right way to request an override from our taxpayers?

245
00:22:10,184 --> 00:22:15,067
Our city deserves, our citizens deserve more transparency than we're currently seeing.

246
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:19,930
Our citizens need more information on the city's finances.

247
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:23,832
The city council needs more information on the city's finances.

248
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,052
They don't have it.

249
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:35,176
How many times, and we go to Rick or to anyone else, George, how many times have you asked the city's finance director, is he still reconciling some previous year?

250
00:22:36,276 --> 00:22:37,277
Well, they're working on it.

251
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:40,838
No one wants to tell anybody what's really there.

252
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,971
And that's a problem.

253
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,913
So people will vote without really knowing.

254
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:57,362
Our citizens need to know that there will be a likely third override coming to them in the future for that high school.

255
00:22:58,382 --> 00:23:02,866
Now, whether it's a rebuild or it's a renovation, it's going to be expensive.

256
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:04,708
It's gonna be expensive.

257
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:10,091
And SBA will not give us 90 cents on the dollar like they did way back when.

258
00:23:10,692 --> 00:23:14,814
And we will not have buildings to sell off to pick up the rest and make money.

259
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:24,319
Our citizens need to be assured, need to be assured that the school budget will not be shortchanged.

260
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,541
That any municipal service will not be shortchanged.

261
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:33,264
When legitimate resources are available without an override.

262
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:36,940
Let's not leverage the override.

263
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,583
Let's not create a crisis in order to get an override through.

264
00:23:43,544 --> 00:23:56,954
If there's a need for more money down the road for operations, after the high school project becomes known and the reimbursement rate, well, okay, put it out there and people can talk about it.

265
00:23:57,634 --> 00:24:00,736
But right now, you haven't got all the information.

266
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:02,638
Right now, you don't know

267
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,186
The big ticket item coming down the road.

268
00:24:05,966 --> 00:24:06,986
You haven't got any idea.

269
00:24:07,006 --> 00:24:09,447
At least you don't, many of you don't.

270
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:12,048
And it's important that you do.

271
00:24:13,048 --> 00:24:16,829
Because too many people out there are going to be pushed out of their homes.

272
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:20,610
Too many people are going to not be able to afford to come to Medford.

273
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,511
And our school system will be played with.

274
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,805
You don't leverage the school system.

275
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:34,049
You make sure, you don't leverage the fire department, the police department, you don't leverage the, you make sure they have what they need to do the job.

276
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:37,931
And if you've got the resources available, then do it.

277
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:42,373
And if you really, really need something, then you make the case for it.

278
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,415
And in my opinion, the case hasn't been made.

279
00:24:46,536 --> 00:24:47,516
The case hasn't been made.

280
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,177
Thank you for listening.
