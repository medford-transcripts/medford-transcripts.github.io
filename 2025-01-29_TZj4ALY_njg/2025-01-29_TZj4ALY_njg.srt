1
00:00:07,698 --> 00:00:18,812
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure you go to ours.

2
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:14,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Test one, two.

3
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:15,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Test one, two.

4
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:05,398
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to check that my sound works before the meeting starts.

5
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:06,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?

6
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we can hear you, Alicia.

7
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,620
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thanks.

8
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,301
[SPEAKER_11]: So really, feel free to log off whenever you need to.

9
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:14,282
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

10
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:17,143
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll see how if I disappear suddenly.

11
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,203
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, let's get this going.

12
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:31,973
[SPEAKER_12]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council Planning and Permitting Committee, January 29th, 2025.

13
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,334
[SPEAKER_12]: This meeting will take place at 6 p.m.

14
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:39,737
[SPEAKER_12]: in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hess Drive, and via Zoom.

15
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

16
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

17
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,020
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

18
00:07:46,301 --> 00:07:46,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Leming.

19
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:47,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

20
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:48,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

21
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:49,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

22
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:51,464
[SPEAKER_05]: President Bears.

23
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:52,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Present.

24
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:53,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

25
00:07:53,505 --> 00:07:53,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Present.

26
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,866
[SPEAKER_12]: Four present, one absent.

27
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,147
[SPEAKER_12]: The meeting is called to order.

28
00:07:59,985 --> 00:08:09,592
[SPEAKER_12]: The action discussion item for this meeting is, as usual, paper 24-033, zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.

29
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:16,377
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is going to be kind of a multi-topic meeting.

30
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:27,986
[SPEAKER_12]: First, we're going to go over some updates to the overall zoning project timeline, and Emily from Innes Associates is going to walk us through those, as we know, as we discussed quite a bit in our last

31
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:44,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Planning and permitting committee meeting, there's been calls from Councilors on this committee as well as requests from the public to enhance our messaging strategy around this entire zoning project in order to, you know, essentially to recalibrate at this point of year to take stock of

32
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:54,623
[SPEAKER_12]: how we're getting information out to the public about what's currently at what stage of the process, where current proposals are, when their next public meeting will be, in what body.

33
00:08:56,184 --> 00:09:06,530
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been working on this zoning project since around this time last year, and in that time we've learned a lot about what people need in order to feel properly informed and updated on what we're talking about.

34
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:07,470
[SPEAKER_12]: community.

35
00:09:07,851 --> 00:09:20,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Um so we're doing some things on the City Council side that associates is helping us out with and we're also trying to collaborate with the mayor's office as much as we can to enhance our online information and add in more public meetings so that people have more opportunities for.

36
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:25,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Um for learning, you know, in a way that works for more community members and for Q and A as well.

37
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,020
[SPEAKER_12]: So Emily will speak more to that.

38
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:30,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Um and after we run through those updates,

39
00:09:36,787 --> 00:09:38,171
[SPEAKER_12]: zoning proposal.

40
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:54,825
[SPEAKER_12]: and then I think we will get a little just just a short briefing on the other part of the residential proposal that we will discuss a future meeting that goes along with the neighborhood residential proposal, but that we won't be going into in depth tonight, so we'll talk more about neighborhood residential.

41
00:09:54,845 --> 00:10:08,514
[SPEAKER_12]: We get to that part of the process, but first I'll turn it over to Emily to talk about Schedule and communications updates unless there are any initial comments or questions from my fellow Councilors or members of city staff that I see on Zoom.

42
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:13,498
[SPEAKER_12]: And seeing none, I'll turn it over to Emily.

43
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

44
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:23,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for the record, Emily Ennis of Innes Associates, and I'm just going to share my screen so you all can see it.

45
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:42,961
[SPEAKER_02]: We, as you said, are going to just run you through some changes to the timeline, some additional opportunities for public engagement, so I'll walk you through that, and then I'll turn it over to Paola for her review of the residential zoning.

46
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:46,802
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where we are on the schedule today, January 29th.

47
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:50,524
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at the neighborhood and urban residential later on here.

48
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:58,748
[SPEAKER_02]: We are continuing to look at neighborhood and residential throughout February and March.

49
00:10:59,468 --> 00:11:20,929
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, February to the end of March or end of February and then March we're going to take up the commercial areas that are remaining and then move our way March and April for commercial both the squares and some of the other corridors and then move into May looking at Wellington and also starting to wrap up sort of the overall components that we've been doing.

50
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,394
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to call out the known Community Development Board meetings.

51
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:31,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So February 5th, we're going to talk about Green Score next week.

52
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:42,726
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to request, and I'll explain as we get to public meetings, after conversations after the last City Board meeting, that Salem Street be moved, continued to March 5th.

53
00:11:44,027 --> 00:12:04,380
[SPEAKER_02]: um uh in conversations with uh the city planning staff um and sort of other people who have been involved on the city side we feel that this is a good move to allow for additional public comment and engagement um and then we are also going to start grouping some of the topics so that they go together to the community development board

54
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:15,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand for the comments that we heard last week that in some cases people were confused or hadn't understood that there was a citywide zoning process.

55
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:27,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And we feel that by grouping some of these topics for the city board, it will be easier for people to see how the pieces are working together of the overall project.

56
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, we would also like to do and have discussed this idea of doing some additional public comment period.

57
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:44,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sometimes hard for people to make the official meetings, whether it's of this committee or city council as a whole, or the city board.

58
00:12:45,243 --> 00:12:50,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes those evening schedules on the days they fall aren't always good.

59
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:57,192
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are looking at February 10th for a community meeting to present and discuss Salem Street.

60
00:12:57,672 --> 00:13:10,842
[SPEAKER_02]: The format of this would be a presentation by ourselves to let people know what it is, what we're doing, why we're doing it, what the components are, how it ties into the comprehensive plan.

61
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:23,670
[SPEAKER_02]: and then a significant question and answer period at the end or the bulk of the meeting so that people have the opportunity to ask their questions, air their concerns, air their hopes for the area.

62
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:32,196
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't set dates yet, but we would like to do a similar thing for the residential portions and a similar thing in March for the squares.

63
00:13:32,216 --> 00:13:36,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk to you in more detail about dates as we confirm those.

64
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:43,776
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also talking about video topics that we wanted to confirm with you.

65
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:50,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I know these meetings are put there sort of obviously televised now they're put online.

66
00:13:51,282 --> 00:13:58,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the CD board but that's a lot for people to wade through when they don't have much time to spare.

67
00:13:58,308 --> 00:14:03,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we'd like to do is break down some of these topics into about two minute videos.

68
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:19,007
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've we've talked certainly videos one through five we've talked about them publicly already at the official city meetings, but we'd like to break them down as I said into these smaller sort of chunks so people can engage with the topics on their own time.

69
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:26,635
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are videos that we would create and post to, you know, have the city post their website for the zoning effort.

70
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:54,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're suggesting five now to really start with what the zoning update is, all the areas that we're looking at, again, tying it back to the comprehensive plan, the reason that the city is doing this and why they hired us to assist, and then start to break down some of the, we've had the advantage of hearing some of the questions about Salem Street, and so breaking those topics down into smaller chunks that people can look at.

71
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:59,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, the green score obviously is not something that people have had a chance to hear yet.

72
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,949
[SPEAKER_02]: They will, uh, February 5th.

73
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they have here, but not at the CD board.

74
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:15,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as we were looking at the breakdown that we were proposed for Salem Street, it seemed to make sense to do a similar sort of breakdown for the neighborhoods as the next section of videos or collection of videos.

75
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the commercial districts uses and dimensions.

76
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:33,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the other topics that we're covering with you aren't maybe complex enough, but we thought that the combination of transportation demand management and parking would be something that would be complex enough that we felt a video would be appropriate.

77
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:39,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It may even be as we get closer that they need to be broken into two separate videos so we could certainly have a look at that.

78
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:49,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Parking is by itself a complex topic and not everybody understands transportation demand management so we felt that those particularly deserved a video.

79
00:15:51,425 --> 00:16:10,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, just to confirm, you know where we are, we talked about it above, but these are the specific things that we're looking at right now in January neighborhood residential SF one and SF to a little bit of a peek ahead today to urban residential which are apartments wanted to in general residential, and then looking at the C one district.

80
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:21,894
[SPEAKER_02]: in March and April, but using different geographies to look at the C1 district, and then our final districts in May, looking at Wellington, Glenwood, the office, industrial, and mixed use.

81
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:26,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously for all of these, we're doing uses, dimensional standards, development standards.

82
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:33,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the topics, housing of course is a topic in January and February.

83
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:39,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Also ADUs because the new state legislation is coming online in February for ADUs.

84
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:56,079
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those neighborhood commercial nodes that already exist that we've talked about in the comprehensive planning process, little commercial districts, how do we deal with those in terms of allowing them, encouraging them, maybe adding a few controls on there.

85
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:08,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And then March and April, those other topics we've been talking about, community solar, which we've been researching all along, nonconforming uses and structures, and then transportation demand, site plan review, and parking.

86
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:16,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So just again to call out the opportunities for public comments, the dates that we have so far.

87
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:31,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll see the new February 10th public meeting being inserted after the CDB Community Development Board last week, and then the proposed new date to finish up Salem Street with that conversation.

88
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:32,887
[SPEAKER_02]: the green score.

89
00:17:33,968 --> 00:17:38,969
[SPEAKER_02]: As we add the other public meetings, we'll put them in this calendar and update them with you.

90
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:47,112
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the key is for the public to understand that we are adding additional times to comment and also ones that are not part of a formal board meeting.

91
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:53,094
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a little bit more flexibility, perhaps, in how we can answer their questions and provide information.

92
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stop here and see if there's any questions for the councillors before I turn it over to Paola.

93
00:17:58,782 --> 00:17:59,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

94
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:07,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for that overview, Emily, and I do want to thank you and your whole team for your nimbleness in kind of adding in these additional enhanced communication aspects.

95
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:18,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Mid-year, while we're still going through the work of zoning, I think that these are really important, and I hope that as many residents as possible will take advantage of these added public meetings.

96
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:24,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Before I recognize my fellow councilors, I'll just note, I did get confirmation just earlier today that that public Q&A

97
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:40,894
[SPEAKER_12]: on the Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District will be at the Roberts on Monday, February 10th, starting at 6 30, and we will be working with the city to make sure that that information gets put out on as many communication channels as possible developed in person at the Roberts.

98
00:18:41,234 --> 00:18:42,394
[SPEAKER_12]: 6 30 on February 10th.

99
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:46,335
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli and then go to President Bears.

100
00:18:47,936 --> 00:18:50,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thank you, Council Vice President.

101
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:52,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I

102
00:18:54,488 --> 00:19:01,090
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I find it a little disturbing and I appreciate the movement.

103
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:22,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that as I've been stating from the beginning of this process is that we're seeing what people have said years ago in bringing these meetings into the neighborhoods and we see the situation with the Salem Street corridor and what's happened there and I appreciate the extra meetings but I really think

104
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:29,320
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to take a more proactive approach moving on with other zoning areas.

105
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:46,112
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even just to share because unfortunately, sometimes people seem to think on the council that I'm trying to stir apart or be negative all the time, but I'm receiving emails and the residents have questions, questions that I think that

106
00:19:46,997 --> 00:20:02,080
[SPEAKER_01]: like Salem Street could have been answered at meetings that I requested at the beginning and being glad to see that we're finally moving to the Roberts into the neighborhoods because people aren't, although these are public meetings, people aren't getting the information.

107
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:11,762
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see that by the mayor's letter that she sent out stating that she's now going to involve her communications team.

108
00:20:11,822 --> 00:20:13,842
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that should be hand in hand moving forward.

109
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:30,750
[SPEAKER_01]: I only say this for the fact that as we move forward to the neighborhood, the residential neighborhood zoning where people have already started calling saying, George, is it true that the Lawrence estates is now going to have 2 or 3 families and it's going to change the look of our community?

110
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,112
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are questions that are so simple to answer, but.

111
00:20:36,252 --> 00:20:48,996
[SPEAKER_01]: the access to these meetings or even understanding these meetings or, um, understanding what, um, information that people in, uh, in the community can access.

112
00:20:49,436 --> 00:20:53,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's easy for us because we do this every day.

113
00:20:53,857 --> 00:21:00,539
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, again, um, you know, like I said, the biggest, uh,

114
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:12,970
[SPEAKER_01]: The most unified comments we had when we first started the recodification of the zoning was as we bring it to the next step is really having that RFP beefed up to make sure that we have a robust.

115
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:19,931
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, communication avenue into the areas that we are looking to rezone.

116
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:30,141
[SPEAKER_01]: So residents can be part of the process, not reactionary, like we're seeing across the neighborhood, um, across the community.

117
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:37,728
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just implore to my colleagues and, um, and, um, our director and Ennis that

118
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:43,450
[SPEAKER_01]: We start thinking a little proactive and start moving into the neighborhoods as we move these meetings.

119
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,191
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've, we've had meetings in the past where we've gone to the high school.

120
00:21:47,211 --> 00:21:50,252
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone to both the middle schools.

121
00:21:50,312 --> 00:21:57,034
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone to many different locations to make sure that we're bringing the message to the neighbors and.

122
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:15,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the neighbors and what I'm hearing already that there's coalitions, neighborhood coalitions that are starting that already starting to talk about how they're going to go in and and battle the city because of lack of information going into our next next phases.

123
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:16,966
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um,

124
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:20,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to, I just want to inform you this.

125
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,700
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.

126
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:31,344
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some consoles would think that this is a, you know, Council Scarpelli being negative again but again, as one Councilor like I mentioned the last few meetings.

127
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:37,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting those emails from the residents that feel like they're not being heard by by our.

128
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:40,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Council and by our city administration.

129
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:45,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, I'm glad the mayor stepped up and started.

130
00:22:48,016 --> 00:22:52,840
[SPEAKER_01]: And putting some processes with her communication team for sale, I implore you all.

131
00:22:53,696 --> 00:23:04,167
[SPEAKER_01]: to contact the mayor, bring her communication team in as we move forward with these processes, because again, we all know this hasn't been looked at in many, many years.

132
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:16,039
[SPEAKER_01]: And from what we're hearing with what people feel in Salem Street, again, like I said, when you talk about residents from Lawrence Road and the Lawrence Estates, and they're frightened that the

133
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:22,241
[SPEAKER_01]: their quaint neighborhoods are not going to be changed to have the possibility of jamming in three family homes.

134
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:32,663
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where they're getting this information, but this is the, um, this is because of lack of notification and lack of, um, community participation.

135
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, I've said this 1000 times.

136
00:23:35,304 --> 00:23:40,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Council vice president has done Yeoman's work in putting the

137
00:23:41,085 --> 00:23:57,678
[SPEAKER_01]: uh council meetings in order organizing them all but unfortunately it's just not uh it's just not getting to the community and i'm afraid we're going to be stalled uh zone after zone as we keep moving forward until we really put a comprehensive plan in place so thank you

138
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:15,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for your comments, Councilor Scarpelli, I agree with a lot of what you said I think absolutely when there's not information that's legible and comprehensible and easy to find those are the conditions when confusing or misinformation can flourish and you've pointed that out so I'm glad that we are

139
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:21,442
[SPEAKER_12]: At a point in the year, we're working better together to make sure that we are trying to make progress on some of those goals that we share.

140
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:37,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm really heartened to see that INNIS has already been working to schedule the public Q&A for the next zoning topics after this one so that we can keep building the ship ever better with this topic and then use these improved communication methods for all of the proposals going forward.

141
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thank everybody who has been helping us think through

142
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:46,998
[SPEAKER_12]: what that has to look like, councillors and residents, both included.

143
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,783
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll recognize President Bears.

144
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:54,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

145
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:56,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to

146
00:24:57,433 --> 00:25:18,408
[SPEAKER_09]: thank the Innist team and our planning development and sustainability office and you for your work continuing on this project and note also this is and I think we've noted at every time a continuation of the comprehensive plan process that established the citywide comprehensive plan in 2023

147
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:35,258
[SPEAKER_09]: that had input from thousands of residents across dozens of events and meetings and other ways of getting information like surveys and interviews and a lot of other sessions that has gotten us to this point.

148
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:44,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I think something that we study in economics is the idea that

149
00:25:46,223 --> 00:25:57,607
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, the quote unquote free market only works if everyone has perfect information, which means every single person in a market knows everything, every single piece of information that everyone else knows.

150
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:12,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the first lessons that you learn in economics is that that's impossible and that that's why we have rules and regulations and laws and processes.

151
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:26,437
[SPEAKER_09]: And while I'm encouraged that we continue to iteratively try to improve those processes, there will never be perfect information where everyone knows exactly every piece of information and has heard everything they want to hear.

152
00:26:27,857 --> 00:26:30,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just think it's important to acknowledge that as well.

153
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:40,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, again, you know, I think we've been actually incredibly responsive to hearing from residents.

154
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:42,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of these zoning proposals

155
00:26:43,854 --> 00:26:48,180
[SPEAKER_09]: have not had people saying some of the things that are being said on Salem Street.

156
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:54,969
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've adjusted the process to try to answer more questions and get more information out there.

157
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:16,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that that is the work of government, especially a government like here in Medford where we are deeply under resourced, and we don't have the hundred person planning department in Somerville or the multi hundred person planning department in Cambridge or thousand person planning department of Boston.

158
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:25,486
[SPEAKER_09]: or even the revenue that we see in cities like Everett, or the government help that comes from the state and other communities around the Commonwealth.

159
00:27:25,566 --> 00:27:28,108
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are working very diligently.

160
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,289
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate your leadership on that.

161
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about

162
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,331
[SPEAKER_09]: what you've been doing.

163
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:42,414
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the one piece of this kind of conversation that we haven't talked about is how you've been working with the city administration.

164
00:27:42,434 --> 00:27:47,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have additional engagement from the communications team.

165
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:54,241
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could talk a little bit more about what that's going to look like in terms of the information available to residents online.

166
00:27:56,271 --> 00:27:59,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly, thank you for your comments and I'm happy to go over that in brief.

167
00:28:00,115 --> 00:28:12,507
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that at our last meeting, there was specifically a motion for myself as chair to be working with the city, with the mayor's office and her communications office to make sure that

168
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:18,970
[SPEAKER_12]: we're doing all we can in collaboration to make sure that more and better information is reaching people more effectively.

169
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,832
[SPEAKER_12]: So specifically, what's that looking like?

170
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:26,777
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working on a lot behind the scenes now, and I'm excited for some of this to go live, hopefully within a couple of weeks.

171
00:28:28,678 --> 00:28:33,743
[SPEAKER_12]: One part of this that I think is really important is overhauling the zoning page on the city website.

172
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:39,227
[SPEAKER_12]: As a quick reminder, the city council doesn't really have direct control over any part of the city website.

173
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:40,709
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a collaborative project.

174
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:56,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Currently, I think, and this is by no means a pejorative or a criticism, but I think it is just a fact that the zoning page on the city website is very hard to navigate if you're a layperson, if you're an average resident who heard, who has a zoning question, heard about a proposal.

175
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,122
[SPEAKER_12]: and you Google Medford MA zoning, it's quite hard to find what you're looking for.

176
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:04,024
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's not the fault of the planning department or the communications team.

177
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:08,527
[SPEAKER_12]: Zoning is inherently wonky and technical and detailed and confusing.

178
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:19,495
[SPEAKER_12]: And to President Bears' point about us being a fairly under-resourced city, it would take more than a two-person communications department to sort and present that and design that in a way.

179
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:24,977
[SPEAKER_12]: that makes it be what people need it to be.

180
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:50,388
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're now working collaboratively to completely overhaul that webpage, which I am quite excited about as a visual person myself, with the goal being that this becomes more of a site where when people have a question, maybe they've heard about Salem Street, maybe they've heard about the residential neighborhood proposal, they can navigate to that site, and it is impossible to miss up-to-date and current information, summaries, bullet points, FAQs, and diagrams, but let them know what's being worked on

181
00:29:50,968 --> 00:29:59,773
[SPEAKER_12]: who is currently talking about it, what body, and what the next public meetings are on that topic, when they can attend to ask questions and learn more.

182
00:30:00,073 --> 00:30:07,237
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that we'll also have, as Emily mentioned, there's also going to be very short-form digestible videos coming from Innes Associates.

183
00:30:07,297 --> 00:30:07,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Those will be linked.

184
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:17,783
[SPEAKER_12]: And kind of the broader picture that we have for the website is not just to be very, very easily findable, digestible information about the current zoning proposals, but also to

185
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:35,500
[SPEAKER_12]: do a better job of reinforcing for residents that these are not individual proposals that we're just taking up Salem Street and that's the end of the story or we're not just taking up Mystic Avenue corridor district and that's the end of the story but this is a coordinated really more than a year-long effort this is a

186
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:38,222
[SPEAKER_12]: a citywide zoning review.

187
00:30:38,802 --> 00:30:45,164
[SPEAKER_12]: So as people are finding out, okay, March 5, next meeting about Salem Street, good to know I can save that date, I can put it in my calendar.

188
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:50,485
[SPEAKER_12]: They're also seeing a timeline that reminds them that after Salem Street comes the neighborhood residential proposal.

189
00:30:50,705 --> 00:31:05,490
[SPEAKER_12]: And after that, we'll be talking about squares and corridors, and letting people know that this is a citywide process that they can plug into any time between now and June, or they can kind of mark a month on their calendar and make sure to tune back in if there's a particular area that they're interested in.

190
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:12,877
[SPEAKER_12]: So I am looking forward to those updates to the zoning page on the website.

191
00:31:14,118 --> 00:31:15,119
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a major one.

192
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:18,281
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the series of explainer videos from Innes Associates.

193
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:29,511
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working to, kind of in concert with all of this, be putting out more frequent updates in the form of fresh releases, collaboration between the city council and the mayor's office.

194
00:31:30,331 --> 00:31:35,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Essentially, we're trying to make sure that our announcements about these are touching all of our existing communications channels.

195
00:31:35,535 --> 00:31:37,056
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that some people go on the website.

196
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:39,057
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that some people are signed up for the e-alerts.

197
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,859
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that some people do reverse 911.

198
00:31:41,899 --> 00:31:43,640
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that some people have social media.

199
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:49,064
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're trying to make sure that we are consistently creating information that's short form.

200
00:31:49,204 --> 00:31:50,084
[SPEAKER_12]: What do you need to know?

201
00:31:50,224 --> 00:31:51,485
[SPEAKER_12]: When is this going to be talked about?

202
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:55,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Information for each of the zoning proposals that can be shared on all of these communication channels.

203
00:31:57,189 --> 00:32:09,220
[SPEAKER_12]: so that anybody who's interested at the very least can know where they can go to learn more and they can go to that place and actually learn more instead of getting confused and overwhelmed and then clicking away, or they can know where to watch a video or where to attend a meeting.

204
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:12,843
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the short form.

205
00:32:13,004 --> 00:32:14,445
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like there's probably something that I forgot.

206
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:29,062
[SPEAKER_12]: but the overall structure being that vastly improved web page on the city website, more frequent press release and social media updates paired with more frequent use of reverse 911 to let people know about upcoming meetings.

207
00:32:35,764 --> 00:32:38,485
[SPEAKER_12]: With that, are there, oh, thank you, Councilor Callahan.

208
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

209
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:46,754
[SPEAKER_03]: I, myself, am very excited that we're going to have some meetings about zoning that are not in this room.

210
00:32:47,695 --> 00:32:51,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Going out, you know, where the people are, places that people feel more comfortable.

211
00:32:52,618 --> 00:32:53,859
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really great.

212
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:07,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that we are under-resourced, but I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli's push for us to really do more and to do our best effort to get

213
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,010
[SPEAKER_03]: all this information out to people.

214
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:21,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And that being said, I do want to make a comment that we have been, am I correct, 37 years without zoning changes?

215
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:23,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 30 years.

216
00:33:24,693 --> 00:33:27,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's closer to 40, yeah.

217
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:27,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Close to 40.

218
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:46,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Not deciding to not change anything is a decision, and the world changes and the demographics of our city changes and coven happens and you know things happen in the world the.com bust in the 2000s happened and, you know, things.

219
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,801
[SPEAKER_03]: change in the world and in our city.

220
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:56,306
[SPEAKER_03]: And the choice for the city council to not change the zoning is a choice, as much as a change is a choice.

221
00:33:57,107 --> 00:34:06,853
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally have talked to many people who, you know, have been wanting a lot of the changes, zoning and legislative that we have, you know, on our governing agenda.

222
00:34:07,983 --> 00:34:12,907
[SPEAKER_03]: have said to me, I've lived here for 30 years and I have wanted these things to happen for 30 years.

223
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:14,227
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they would never happen.

224
00:34:14,688 --> 00:34:17,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so excited that finally some of these things are happening.

225
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:28,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, you know, it's just important to remember that while change is hard, the whole world changes and zoning needs to be updated.

226
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:31,540
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the zoning things that we are doing is bringing things to

227
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,641
[SPEAKER_03]: the current non-conforming structures that exist.

228
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:50,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So in many places, we're not, you know, yes, we are changing many things, but there are places where we're simply trying to reflect what actually currently exists because what's built there is not conforming to this old zoning.

229
00:34:50,763 --> 00:34:59,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And on that note, I did have just one small request that in some of our educational materials, I don't know whether it be the videos or just

230
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:11,231
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, infographics that we create or in the writing or whatever that might be, I think it's important for people to be able to see very simply what the old zoning said.

231
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,643
[SPEAKER_03]: what currently exists and is non-conforming, and what the new zoning says.

232
00:35:18,123 --> 00:35:21,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And if people are especially concerned about heights and about density.

233
00:35:22,426 --> 00:35:36,974
[SPEAKER_03]: So in very simple, as much as we can have incredibly simple ways of describing, here's the old zoning, here's the new zoning, and here's what is currently built, and why you can see that in these places, we're actually not changing anything.

234
00:35:36,994 --> 00:35:40,276
[SPEAKER_03]: We're literally, we're changing the zoning, but we're only making it meet what exists.

235
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:43,318
[SPEAKER_03]: and in these other places where we are changing the zoning.

236
00:35:44,038 --> 00:35:49,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those, you know, as much as we can simplify it for people, that would be really helpful.

237
00:35:49,142 --> 00:35:49,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

238
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:57,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, Councilor Hilliam.

239
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:57,707
[SPEAKER_12]: And I agree.

240
00:35:57,767 --> 00:36:10,175
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that it's really important that in all of these updated materials going forward, especially through the use of diagrams and visuals, we should be saying that stuff verbally and linking people to the full documents and making sure that there are

241
00:36:12,227 --> 00:36:33,815
[SPEAKER_12]: really simple, really effective diagram showing, comparing the current zoning to what the current built environment actually is and showing what we love that's currently non-conforming that couldn't be built today with the current zoning, those heights and those densities, because of course that's a lot of what we talk about and a lot of what residents want us to be focusing on when we're talking about zoning.

242
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:34,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

243
00:36:37,627 --> 00:36:43,592
[SPEAKER_12]: Any additional questions before we go forward to the neighborhood residential topic?

244
00:36:47,055 --> 00:36:47,456
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none.

245
00:36:48,637 --> 00:36:53,761
[SPEAKER_12]: So we discussed the, we initiated the topic of the neighborhood residential two weeks ago.

246
00:36:53,841 --> 00:36:57,865
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw a kind of a jumping off point draft proposal from Innes Associates.

247
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:03,590
[SPEAKER_12]: We discussed it, we made some suggested changes already, which we'll be reviewing tonight.

248
00:37:05,111 --> 00:37:19,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Kind of a slight downshifting and all of the sub districts was recommended by this council and I believe that the proposal will be seeing tonight reflects this, just because it was mentioned as as a concern that's been going around I do want to know just off the top for in case people jump off the meeting early.

249
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:35,024
[SPEAKER_12]: In my understanding, it's currently not, triple-deckers are not proposed for Lawrence Estates, and that'll be shown in the, that'll be shown in the diagrams that we'll look at in just a little bit, but I just wanted to make sure that that was cleared up right at the beginning of the presentation.

250
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:40,129
[SPEAKER_12]: So without further exposition, Paola, I'll pass it off to you.

251
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:48,676
[SPEAKER_02]: The pesky microphone.

252
00:37:48,736 --> 00:38:02,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say one thing before I turn it over to Paula for the rest of the meeting is I appreciate Councilor Callahan's discussion or comment about making this more visual, more graphic, the diagrams.

253
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:08,333
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been an internal conversation that we've been having with our team as well to continue to add more to that.

254
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:26,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do also want to say how I felt that our regular Monday meeting with yourself, with President Bears with the city planning staff and with Mayor her communication teams who joined us this Monday, I think the the support there.

255
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:31,199
[SPEAKER_02]: from all parties involved with the process to add more public engagement.

256
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:36,701
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we really appreciate because we were thinking that separately.

257
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:40,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice to know that as we got on the call, everybody else was thinking that as well.

258
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:41,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So just thank you for that.

259
00:38:41,763 --> 00:38:42,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will turn it over to Paula.

260
00:38:47,166 --> 00:38:48,046
[SPEAKER_06]: No, good.

261
00:38:48,746 --> 00:38:54,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I will share the presentation so we can continue.

262
00:39:02,978 --> 00:39:10,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So starting as I always like to start this introduction is where are we coming from, where

263
00:39:13,144 --> 00:39:13,965
[SPEAKER_06]: are we doing here?

264
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:27,656
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's what we're doing is the implementation to zoning that comes from what was identified and published in the comprehensive plan in Medford.

265
00:39:27,676 --> 00:39:30,378
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anyone is interested, what are we doing?

266
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:32,639
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the principles that we are following?

267
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:40,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were all identified in the comprehensive plan that is available for everyone that was published in January 2023.

268
00:39:42,347 --> 00:39:53,172
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as it is already in the comprehensive plan, but it was also released the climate action and adaptation plan in April 2022.

269
00:39:53,572 --> 00:40:03,296
[SPEAKER_06]: So these two, anything that has to do with zoning, we are taking into account with the city councilor and city staff recommendations

270
00:40:04,324 --> 00:40:09,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are bringing all those things into our proposals.

271
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:22,398
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of these are some of the strategies and goals that have been identified in the comprehensive plan and the climate action and adaptation plan.

272
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,838
[SPEAKER_06]: We always refer to this plan.

273
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,179
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the vision plan.

274
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:43,636
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're doing now is to try to make it more concrete to see those densities and to see those boundaries of those corridors, squares, nodes, institutional anchors.

275
00:40:44,397 --> 00:40:46,119
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the residential.

276
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:50,205
[SPEAKER_06]: So where we are now is working on the residential.

277
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:57,955
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we have, so what we do is exactly what Councilor Callaghan asked.

278
00:40:59,197 --> 00:41:01,961
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to make it more visual and some of the

279
00:41:03,853 --> 00:41:07,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Diagrams that we need to produce to reflect this.

280
00:41:07,434 --> 00:41:09,714
[SPEAKER_06]: We are also thinking of different strategies.

281
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:17,956
[SPEAKER_06]: First we look into the current zoning, then we looked into what is existing now, because a lot of times that doesn't match.

282
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,756
[SPEAKER_06]: So where are all those inconsistencies?

283
00:41:21,356 --> 00:41:29,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And then with all these strategies from the comprehensive plan, all these goals and objectives, we will bring it into a new proposal.

284
00:41:30,395 --> 00:41:34,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Um so in your current here we have the current zoning.

285
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:46,986
[SPEAKER_06]: The districts that are about, uh, what the residential districts would be the single family one single family to apartment one apartment to general residential.

286
00:41:48,187 --> 00:41:53,931
[SPEAKER_06]: I will explain later on what this include what they permit and why not.

287
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:55,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Um

288
00:41:57,301 --> 00:41:58,642
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do a lot of analysis.

289
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:19,622
[SPEAKER_06]: We check the transit system from bike stations to bus lanes to T stations, commuter rail, and other kinds of analysis with densities, dimensions that we will look into later on, building typologies, et cetera.

290
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:40,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have looked into the mixed-use districts or the non-exclusive residential districts where we have here a bit more detail these corridors which we are differentiation between the regional that will be the

291
00:42:41,604 --> 00:42:50,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Mystic Avenue, that regional corridor, and the other corridors that are more neighborhood, as for example, Salem Street, we've been working on those too.

292
00:42:50,929 --> 00:43:03,897
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be looking into the squares, the institutional district, that's the Tufts area, and then special districts that we will be looking into as well at the end of this Wellington Riverside.

293
00:43:06,797 --> 00:43:17,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we are doing is a more citywide strategy and we will be looking at all of this and then the residential neighborhoods.

294
00:43:19,114 --> 00:43:23,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So one thing that we wanted to look is what is existing there?

295
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,436
[SPEAKER_06]: What is there right now?

296
00:43:26,077 --> 00:43:28,638
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the building typologies in Medford?

297
00:43:29,138 --> 00:43:38,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have this map which show us the single family, two family, condo conversion, three family, four to eight units, and more than nine units.

298
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:44,984
[SPEAKER_06]: These help us to look at what the density is currently in these districts.

299
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:57,995
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are the considerations that we took into account while looking at these neighborhood residential and urban residential districts?

300
00:43:58,656 --> 00:44:00,918
[SPEAKER_06]: We needed to place a framework.

301
00:44:01,378 --> 00:44:09,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we looked was the proximity to highly frequent and efficient public transit, the proximity to higher job density areas.

302
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:11,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see it in the map on the left.

303
00:44:11,847 --> 00:44:13,889
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from the comprehensive plan.

304
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:18,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Lot sizes and the topography of the area.

305
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:20,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Existing residential types.

306
00:44:20,413 --> 00:44:21,734
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the map that we just saw.

307
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:31,260
[SPEAKER_06]: And then sometimes we need to look at a more transition between this low, medium and high density that we have.

308
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,163
[SPEAKER_06]: We really don't have high, high density, but from low to medium density areas.

309
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:44,830
[SPEAKER_06]: to make it more transitional, to not be really a big difference between them.

310
00:44:45,491 --> 00:44:47,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are all the things that we are looking into.

311
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:53,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And we made a proposal, this was for last time, where we had

312
00:44:55,908 --> 00:45:13,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So this proposal was amended into, um, by the city council in last, um, planning and permitted committee meeting where we reduce it into three neighborhood residential and then one urban residential.

313
00:45:13,828 --> 00:45:13,868
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

314
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:39,953
[SPEAKER_06]: We looked into this, we took it all the considerations back into the studio and we wanted to analyze what is the, so we created this map, what is the current zoning district and what happened when we underlay the existing residential types.

315
00:45:41,734 --> 00:45:44,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And so do, yeah, you can see my cursor.

316
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:57,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are some areas where there is already occurring or happening some kind of higher or increasing density that is naturally occurring.

317
00:45:58,085 --> 00:46:05,130
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not on their district or is not allowed in the district, but this higher density is happening.

318
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:21,042
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to look into that, things that are happening because of proximity to more highly dense areas or job areas or mixed areas or transit areas.

319
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:27,486
[SPEAKER_06]: So we took that in consideration and we came up with a new proposal.

320
00:46:28,387 --> 00:46:33,189
[SPEAKER_06]: So last time we focused a lot on the northern part of the city of Medford.

321
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:38,252
[SPEAKER_06]: So the North Medford Fulton Heights, the Lawrence States and West Medford.

322
00:46:39,332 --> 00:46:44,495
[SPEAKER_06]: But we didn't go quite into the South Medford, the South area of Medford.

323
00:46:45,215 --> 00:46:52,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we wanted was to come up with a different proposal and just this is another draft.

324
00:46:52,459 --> 00:46:54,180
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wanted to hear your reactions.

325
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,982
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are proposing three neighborhood residential.

326
00:46:58,322 --> 00:47:00,083
[SPEAKER_06]: This is neighborhood residential one.

327
00:47:01,104 --> 00:47:07,368
[SPEAKER_06]: This allows single-unit dwelling plus the ADU and a historic conversion of two units.

328
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:17,995
[SPEAKER_06]: We have neighborhood residential two, single-unit dwelling plus ADU, two-unit dwelling and historic conversion, two to three units.

329
00:47:18,868 --> 00:47:28,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we have neighborhood residential, three single unit dwelling, plus ADU, two unit dwelling, three unit dwelling townhouse, and historic conversion, two to four units.

330
00:47:29,212 --> 00:47:38,575
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to urban residential, two unit dwelling, historic conversion, two to five townhouse, and multiple unit dwelling from two to four units.

331
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:44,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, urban residential two, uh, that is the really orange bright color.

332
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:48,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, usually they go with apartment two already in those districts.

333
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:51,115
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's multiple unit dwelling plus four units.

334
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:59,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, the urban residential, we will continue to look more the specifics at the moment we are focusing more on the neighborhood residential.

335
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:04,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and what we did in this map was to

336
00:48:06,141 --> 00:48:23,615
[SPEAKER_06]: all the neighborhoods that are in the new proposal and just lay out, underlay the residential existing types so that you could see why are we proposing some neighborhood three in certain areas.

337
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:27,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually it's because we already have those typologies.

338
00:48:27,058 --> 00:48:29,781
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we go into a neighborhood two,

339
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:37,527
[SPEAKER_06]: meaning permitting only on to duplex in an area that is mainly duplex and some already three units.

340
00:48:37,927 --> 00:48:43,291
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're doing is downsizing and down-densifying what is already there.

341
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:50,257
[SPEAKER_06]: We are putting a cap to what and already making non-conforming things that we already that are already existing.

342
00:48:50,857 --> 00:48:51,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just wanted to

343
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:12,586
[SPEAKER_06]: to give this maps that we use for analysis to bring this new proposal and to see if we could consider some of the proposed that we did last time in the last meeting.

344
00:49:15,267 --> 00:49:22,630
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to stop here so that we can process this information and I would love to hear your comments on this.

345
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:37,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I may just briefly add, I think that, you know, we absolutely appreciated the direction that the city council gave us last time but if you remember we said at the end we want the flexibility to look at the boundaries and see what's on either side of it.

346
00:49:38,238 --> 00:49:42,921
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really what this analysis has been about is making sure that we are not.

347
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:58,464
[SPEAKER_02]: intentionally, as Pella just said, unintentionally downgrading the existing density in some areas, but being respectful throughout the entire city of what's already there and how do we best capture that in new zoning.

348
00:49:58,504 --> 00:50:12,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say that, of course, I think we've already transmitted this, but I believe for those watching at home who want to spend more time looking at the maps, not to mention yourselves, Councilors, is this PDF is available after the meeting for people to really peruse as well.

349
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:14,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

350
00:50:14,427 --> 00:50:15,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Emily.

351
00:50:15,088 --> 00:50:15,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Paola.

352
00:50:15,728 --> 00:50:21,852
[SPEAKER_12]: And yes, it's on the City Council's public portal already as an attachment for this meeting.

353
00:50:22,412 --> 00:50:26,855
[SPEAKER_12]: So folks can download that and zoom all the way in like I've been doing the past couple of days.

354
00:50:28,636 --> 00:50:30,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for the overview.

355
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:31,637
[SPEAKER_12]: And I appreciate that note.

356
00:50:32,558 --> 00:50:36,560
[SPEAKER_12]: As with any other zoning proposal, this is about balance.

357
00:50:37,061 --> 00:50:42,404
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that there are a lot of goals of reevaluating our zoning.

358
00:50:43,905 --> 00:50:51,213
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, one of those goals is to say, where is incremental more density or more height or more this or more that appropriate?

359
00:50:51,353 --> 00:51:02,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Another way of looking at it is to say, where are there a lot of non-conforming lots already that we should not make further out of compliance, that we should update the zoning so that it reflects what's already there?

360
00:51:02,304 --> 00:51:04,387
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that some of the neighborhood residential proposal

361
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:10,399
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of centers those two questions at the same time.

362
00:51:10,419 --> 00:51:23,546
[SPEAKER_12]: I was saying, where does it make sense that we should, where in the city is the transit proximity and the existing density and the roadways and the topography make it so it makes a lot of sense to incrementally up-zone here?

363
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:30,170
[SPEAKER_12]: And what are those areas where we actually, as we're trying to unify and make consistent,

364
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:44,426
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing I heard is that I think that one of the, in a way, one of the amendments from two weeks ago might actually make a lot of what's existing on the ground in some single family two districts out of conforming with the proposed zoning.

365
00:51:44,446 --> 00:51:49,768
[SPEAKER_12]: So we wanna make sure that we're making things more coherent as opposed to less as this advances.

366
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:51,549
[SPEAKER_12]: So I know I have some questions.

367
00:51:51,629 --> 00:51:57,492
[SPEAKER_12]: I have some comments from reviewing these, but I want to first recognize other councilors.

368
00:51:57,552 --> 00:51:59,253
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go first to President Bears.

369
00:52:01,302 --> 00:52:03,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

370
00:52:03,564 --> 00:52:09,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this map is incredibly insightful.

371
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:11,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this actually gives us the picture.

372
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows citywide.

373
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:19,036
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows where corridors and squares are, which are the places that are kind of in the gray.

374
00:52:21,192 --> 00:52:27,254
[SPEAKER_09]: and showing the existing condition under the boundaries that are done by parcel.

375
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:29,055
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a great visual.

376
00:52:29,075 --> 00:52:30,596
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to thank you for putting this together.

377
00:52:30,816 --> 00:52:35,278
[SPEAKER_09]: It really, I think, helps show what we're talking about.

378
00:52:35,298 --> 00:52:42,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a couple of thoughts on a couple of these boundaries and where we should look at one and two.

379
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:47,482
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know we've had some discussions in previous meetings about this.

380
00:52:49,162 --> 00:52:54,686
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not, I don't think, worth getting into right now, saying, like, look at this little square, and I think that should be different.

381
00:52:56,287 --> 00:53:17,142
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I noted, and it might be more of a comment for when we talk about dimensional, but I think something that also will be important to think about is what some design and performance standards look like for the third stories of the neighborhood, two and three districts where

382
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:25,983
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we've definitely, I think the two and a half story idea, I think is a really not a great one.

383
00:53:26,063 --> 00:53:33,329
[SPEAKER_09]: And that really negatively impacts what a lot of property owners want to do with their properties in the city.

384
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:46,939
[SPEAKER_09]: But I also think that we can be artful about what a third story looks like so that we get some of the design benefits that I think we all like about just the visual of a three story building.

385
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:49,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, that's my comment at this point.

386
00:53:50,398 --> 00:53:58,241
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure it'll come up a little later, but I think this visual really brings home exactly what we're talking about.

387
00:53:58,721 --> 00:54:08,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's really only a couple of places here where I think maybe the district is one increment of density higher than I would think it should be.

388
00:54:10,627 --> 00:54:13,028
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of that is in kind of the transitional,

389
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:18,200
[SPEAKER_09]: some of this middle of the city transitional area.

390
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for putting this together.

391
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:24,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Bears.

392
00:54:30,245 --> 00:54:33,567
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other questions or comments from councilors at this point?

393
00:54:33,587 --> 00:54:35,808
[SPEAKER_12]: We will take public participation at the end of this section.

394
00:54:35,828 --> 00:54:39,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll note for myself, I think that

395
00:54:42,478 --> 00:54:57,182
[SPEAKER_12]: As one councillor, I think that this map that we're focusing on is probably the most important one of the presentation, kind of overlaying current land uses, current building types, and superimposing on top of that the proposed new sub-districts.

396
00:54:58,943 --> 00:55:04,845
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really encourage everybody, councillors and the public, to focus on this one specifically as we continue to workshop this proposal.

397
00:55:07,142 --> 00:55:14,551
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, it's very useful to be able to say okay what are the corresponding number of units between the proposed new sub districts and current building uses.

398
00:55:17,322 --> 00:55:19,523
[SPEAKER_12]: letters and numbers for the proposed new sub districts.

399
00:55:19,563 --> 00:55:22,684
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have color coded residential types for what's existentially on the ground.

400
00:55:23,284 --> 00:55:36,169
[SPEAKER_12]: So for me, as I was looking at this map, I was saying, okay, anywhere that any section that is predominantly magenta means that the nine or more units that should probably be our urban residential number two sub district because it should be reflective of the density that's already there.

401
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:44,432
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel strongly as we already said that we should be down zoning nowhere in the city because that's counter to I think all of our goals.

402
00:55:46,738 --> 00:55:54,761
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that this is very instructive for those, most areas of the city, well, maybe not most, a lot of areas of the cities are mixed, which makes sense.

403
00:55:54,901 --> 00:56:02,424
[SPEAKER_12]: That's why our neighborhoods are cozy and feel human scaled is because they're not just the same type of building over and over.

404
00:56:03,504 --> 00:56:12,588
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think a lot of what we're talking about in this discussion is those neighborhoods where there's a mix of, you know, on this map, turquoise and orange and purple.

405
00:56:13,148 --> 00:56:18,990
[SPEAKER_12]: you have some single family, you have some two family, maybe you have some condo conversion, you have a couple three families here and there.

406
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:26,812
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that is really the frontier where we're thinking, we're thinking of zoning, I think it's, it's accurate to think of it as a 30 year map, not a next year map.

407
00:56:27,712 --> 00:56:35,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I think when we look at economic trends and building trends, we're building out the map that we want to see on the ground and in 30 or 40 years.

408
00:56:37,234 --> 00:56:39,755
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's the ground where we have to be making those decisions about

409
00:56:42,118 --> 00:56:47,759
[SPEAKER_12]: for example, is that an NR3 or is it a UR1 or is it an NR2?

410
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:58,142
[SPEAKER_12]: I think for myself, there's a lot of areas in the city where you do see that mix of turquoise and purple, which is to say two family and three family.

411
00:56:59,222 --> 00:57:03,924
[SPEAKER_12]: I would probably like those to be an NR3 or potentially even a UR1.

412
00:57:05,344 --> 00:57:09,686
[SPEAKER_12]: in some of those zones that are especially proximate or bordering on the transit hubs.

413
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:21,812
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's reflective of the density that we already enjoy and because we know that we need to add density and we should be putting it in the places where there's the greatest demand for it and the most supports for it.

414
00:57:27,895 --> 00:57:28,335
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears.

415
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

416
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:51,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And one other thing I think it might be worth noting on some of the specifically, let's take a look at the Wellington district just south of the UR1.

417
00:57:53,693 --> 00:57:54,793
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a, you know,

418
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:16,818
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it might be worth labeling some of the larger condos as nine plus units, rather than condo conversion because I think there's just a few developments in here that are definitely more akin to a larger apartment building that like the condo conversion to three family and I think just a distinction there might be helpful to.

419
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,268
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's just my one other thought, taking a look at the map.

420
00:58:20,308 --> 00:58:30,073
[SPEAKER_09]: I just noticed that I was like, well, yes, the Modera is Rivers Edge or nine plus, but the condos on the other side of the tracks are also multi story multi units on each floor.

421
00:58:35,606 --> 00:58:35,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

422
00:58:36,486 --> 00:58:36,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

423
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:41,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to note that the underlying data for this does come from the city's assessors database.

424
00:58:41,968 --> 00:58:50,010
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we do appreciate when people call out and say, Hey, this, this designation might not be quite right.

425
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:54,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but just to let you know where the base data came from.

426
00:59:08,057 --> 00:59:08,237
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

427
00:59:08,397 --> 00:59:09,398
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for speaking to that.

428
00:59:09,418 --> 00:59:15,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I see any further questions or comments from councillors at this time.

429
00:59:16,003 --> 00:59:21,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I know this is a detailed map to parse, and that's how we're going to revisit it in future committee meetings.

430
00:59:23,249 --> 00:59:24,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Not seeing any at this time.

431
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:28,893
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think that, you know, as we've discussed before, I think that the historic conversion

432
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:34,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And the ADU's discussion is also an important piece of context for all of these sub-districts that we're talking about.

433
00:59:34,474 --> 00:59:38,518
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you feel it's appropriate, maybe we can proceed on to those parts of the presentation next.

434
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:47,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you very much, Madam Chair.

435
00:59:48,315 --> 00:59:52,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So the historic conversion, we have the same as we did last time.

436
00:59:53,377 --> 01:00:01,479
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the conversion of an existing structure that was designed for one use, one unit use or two unit or, sorry.

437
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:05,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I will start again, I got confused.

438
01:00:06,334 --> 01:00:17,389
[SPEAKER_06]: The conversion of an existing structure, we added now the minimum of 70 years old, that it was originally designed for one unit use.

439
01:00:18,195 --> 01:00:25,284
[SPEAKER_06]: and that is going to be converted into a two-unit, multi-unit dwelling with no change of the exterior of the structure.

440
01:00:25,304 --> 01:00:31,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Each unit has an independent entrance directly from the outside of the building or through a common vestibule.

441
01:00:32,493 --> 01:00:36,537
[SPEAKER_06]: And why are we doing what we are bringing this?

442
01:00:37,298 --> 01:00:55,789
[SPEAKER_06]: is the goal of this conversion is to preserve the cultural heritage of a community by ensuring that any changes made are keeping with the historical character of the area, to increase this density citywide in small increments, and to enable smaller and more diverse housing options.

443
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:00,933
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will be the definition that we will be using.

444
01:01:01,933 --> 01:01:05,135
[SPEAKER_06]: And then with this, we will bring some standards

445
01:01:07,157 --> 01:01:08,418
[SPEAKER_06]: for these typologies.

446
01:01:10,821 --> 01:01:15,746
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some drafts as well for the current dimensional standards.

447
01:01:17,308 --> 01:01:29,521
[SPEAKER_06]: The current ones in Medford are being done by use and not by district so that it makes it that every single detached family unit

448
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:35,977
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout all the city is it has exactly the same dimensions.

449
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:48,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we try to propose is in this, and I'm sorry for the typo, but we have NR1, NR2, NR3, and the last one should be

450
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:51,191
[SPEAKER_06]: urban residential one.

451
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are one.

452
01:01:53,012 --> 01:01:53,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for that.

453
01:01:54,992 --> 01:01:58,694
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm going to focus right now only from NR1 to NR3.

454
01:01:59,815 --> 01:02:11,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we wanted to do also was to show that transition between what is the NR1 district and how single family units or single dwelling units

455
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:24,763
[SPEAKER_06]: are being, what is the character in those districts and how that changes and transform into the NR3 where we have a bit of a different identity.

456
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:34,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's why you will see that difference between the different dimensional standards.

457
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:41,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for minimum lot dimensions, we have in NR1, 5,000, NR2, 4,000, and NR3, 3,000.

458
01:02:43,038 --> 01:02:48,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Maximum stories height in stories are going to be NR1 and NR2, 2.5.

459
01:02:49,342 --> 01:02:50,543
[SPEAKER_06]: And then NR3, we have 3.

460
01:02:50,583 --> 01:02:54,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Minimum front setbacks are 15 for NR1, NR2, and then 10 for NR3.

461
01:02:54,366 --> 01:02:55,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Minimum side setbacks, 7.5.

462
01:03:04,933 --> 01:03:11,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Sum 15 in NR 1, 2 and NR 3, 5, sum 10.

463
01:03:12,395 --> 01:03:14,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Minimum rare setback are all the same, 15.

464
01:03:15,496 --> 01:03:18,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Maximum building coverage all the same, 40%.

465
01:03:18,457 --> 01:03:24,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Minimum open space diverse from NR 1, 40%, NR 2, 30%, NR 3, 20%.

466
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:46,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so this is to represent the to have a little bit of difference between the different districts and that each one has a little bit just a different small.

467
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:51,621
[SPEAKER_06]: characteristic or identity that is a bit different.

468
01:03:51,981 --> 01:03:59,723
[SPEAKER_06]: So the dimensions, what we look, again, we do an analysis of what is the lot size.

469
01:04:00,824 --> 01:04:05,185
[SPEAKER_06]: We did the range between less than 3,000, 3,000 to 4,000, 4,000 to 5,000, 5,000 to seven, seven to 10, and plus 10,000 square feet.

470
01:04:13,948 --> 01:04:30,784
[SPEAKER_06]: This gives us an idea of where we have, with the building types, we know what is already existing, we know what type of dimension is in those lots, so we can have an idea of what we can ask of a minimum.

471
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:42,086
[SPEAKER_06]: We also want to bring as much as possible conformity, so to make non-conforming at this moment into conforming.

472
01:04:43,507 --> 01:04:51,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why those sizes of five, four, and three, this is where it comes from, from this analysis as well.

473
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:55,360
[SPEAKER_06]: residential requirements.

474
01:04:55,801 --> 01:05:06,571
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just to, um, understand the difference between the 80 you, uh, single unit dwelling historic conversion and other residential types in especially parking.

475
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:14,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if their size restrictions 80 you we will be talking about this, uh, this month later this month.

476
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what it actually means.

477
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,501
[SPEAKER_06]: This comes from an estate law.

478
01:05:19,822 --> 01:05:30,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So the parking that is required is zero if it's next to a certain public transit or one as a minimum.

479
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:37,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And the maximum size restrictions are 900 square feet or 50% of the total area of the principal structure.

480
01:05:38,110 --> 01:06:01,885
[SPEAKER_06]: single unit dwelling parking is two per dwelling unit historic conversion this will be in something that we will be studying and adding 1.5 per dwelling unit and other residential types 1.5 per dwelling unit so this is what we have right now this parking will be studied later on but at the moment these are the differences between these residential types

481
01:06:03,472 --> 01:06:10,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, again, sorry for the typo in NR4, it doesn't exist anymore, it's UR1.

482
01:06:12,697 --> 01:06:26,125
[SPEAKER_06]: But looking at the NR1, NR2, and NR3, this will be the dimensions, the maximum volume that you could have in this minimum sizes.

483
01:06:30,033 --> 01:06:45,674
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I may just to add on to that, you know, we had that conversation in house about the dimensional standards, how they could help address existing non conforming structures or lots by relaxing.

484
01:06:46,415 --> 01:06:51,239
[SPEAKER_02]: of the existing zoning requirements to match what's actually in the area.

485
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:56,422
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember last June, we had that workshop in this room where we looked at a lot of these standards.

486
01:06:56,582 --> 01:07:07,009
[SPEAKER_02]: This map that Pella has up now is a further refinement to that, again, to double check, okay, in the new sub-districts, are we meeting those?

487
01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:14,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we creating the ability for current buildings, current lots that are considered non-conforming to now be conforming?

488
01:07:15,576 --> 01:07:27,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's something else too, you know, I think when people look at dimensional standards and they start thinking, oh, a 3,000 square foot lot, you know, a building of that size could have fit on a 3,000 square foot lot.

489
01:07:28,307 --> 01:07:32,090
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important to understand that all of these dimensional standards work together.

490
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:39,617
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody has, maybe it's a lot that's currently vacant, it would become conforming under this.

491
01:07:40,197 --> 01:07:52,807
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's a 3,000-square-foot lot or a 3,500-square-foot lot or it's a 4,500-square-foot lot and we've changed it to 4,000, they do still have to meet the other requirements, right?

492
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:55,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have to meet those setback requirements.

493
01:07:55,789 --> 01:07:58,151
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to meet the building coverage requirements.

494
01:07:58,171 --> 01:08:00,252
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to meet the open space requirements.

495
01:08:01,113 --> 01:08:03,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also have to meet the parking requirements.

496
01:08:04,195 --> 01:08:21,617
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for people who don't work with zoning a lot, if you think about sort of what we call the ground plane, the ground level of the lot, you've got a building footprint, you've got setbacks, you've got an open space requirement, and you've got a parking requirement, and those all have to work together.

497
01:08:22,097 --> 01:08:23,738
[SPEAKER_02]: before a building can fit on the lot.

498
01:08:23,878 --> 01:08:28,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's just important that some of these lot dimensions are minimums.

499
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:36,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So people could choose to make something further set back or a larger lot size or whatever.

500
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:40,022
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are maximums, like the maximum building coverage.

501
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:42,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they can't go beyond that.

502
01:08:43,683 --> 01:08:49,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So as people look at these, it's important to think about how they work

503
01:08:49,865 --> 01:08:53,108
[SPEAKER_02]: to gather to control what can actually happen on the site.

504
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:55,811
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

505
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,152
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate that clarification.

506
01:08:57,232 --> 01:09:07,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And as you say, yeah, I think for for any folks, including people in this room who zoning is not their day in and day out bread and butter, I think it's a helpful reminder that

507
01:09:09,347 --> 01:09:22,238
[SPEAKER_12]: lot size is a really important piece of the puzzle, but it's not the only criteria in deciding what use of building, what height of building, how many units can go on that parcel, because other conditions also must be satisfied.

508
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:24,640
[SPEAKER_12]: While we're talking about the

509
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:29,670
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that this is a slide that you have already flagged for update.

510
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:44,603
[SPEAKER_12]: But if we can make sure that to just request for me for the diagram when it's updated to include the urban residential sub districts, if we can make sure that we're seeing models of the buildings that are 2 to 4 stories and above four stories, that'd be great.

511
01:09:44,623 --> 01:09:50,508
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it is possible to also add diagrams for the neighborhood residential sub districts displaying

512
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:55,050
[SPEAKER_12]: the buildings that are currently showed, and also one building with an ADU.

513
01:09:55,111 --> 01:09:59,733
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that will help to flesh out the range of possibilities under the proposed sub-districts.

514
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:02,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

515
01:10:02,614 --> 01:10:02,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

516
01:10:05,715 --> 01:10:06,435
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears, go ahead.

517
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:07,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

518
01:10:07,556 --> 01:10:12,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I think similarly, and I already kind of brought it up, but I think some design standards to look at

519
01:10:12,803 --> 01:10:22,969
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, what a three-story structure might look like where it's more like dormered out with a more sloped roof line or something like that would be helpful.

520
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:37,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think considering for the NR2, maybe something, I don't want to be so particular, like a 2.75, but you know, once we start getting into those, the half stories,

521
01:10:39,364 --> 01:11:00,228
[SPEAKER_09]: about like the usable square footage area of the third story and it, you just, you know, I know having spoken to residents, you know, that sometimes the dormer just isn't, you know, they can't get it, you know, it's not worth doing at 2.5, you know, and I think there might be a way to have this conversation about

522
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:17,044
[SPEAKER_09]: design standards that complement the stories that could allow for a more useful partial third story, or even maybe a full third story in the NR2 district.

523
01:11:17,884 --> 01:11:26,752
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess just one other question, do you see any utility to potentially having

524
01:11:30,442 --> 01:11:36,366
[SPEAKER_09]: like different processes, like a two and a half by right three with special permit, something like that?

525
01:11:36,406 --> 01:11:52,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that just kind of, to me, I think having a clear design review rather than like spot projecting by having special permits might be a better way to go about that, more consistent and easier for people to understand what we're proposing.

526
01:11:52,135 --> 01:11:54,417
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm just interested in your thoughts on that.

527
01:11:59,801 --> 01:12:02,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's, it's a very interesting question.

528
01:12:03,325 --> 01:12:09,371
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears So first of all, as, as we drive through visit different parts of Medford.

529
01:12:10,312 --> 01:12:20,143
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at one today and I like that's a two and a half tall right it's a two and a half story building but each of us it's much older house and each of the stories are slightly taller than.

530
01:12:21,343 --> 01:12:25,444
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are these variations in what a two and a half story is.

531
01:12:26,024 --> 01:12:29,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that idea of design guidelines is really interesting.

532
01:12:30,845 --> 01:12:38,187
[SPEAKER_02]: At a previous firm, I worked on a project for Arlington, which was residential design guidelines that were advisory in nature.

533
01:12:39,107 --> 01:12:43,188
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was primarily for single family homes.

534
01:12:46,629 --> 01:13:00,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, those are generally by right, so they're not going through a special permit or a site plan review process, but it was something that Arlington wanted to be able to use and say hey, if you're doing an addition.

535
01:13:00,981 --> 01:13:09,148
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you can add an addition to an existing single family house this is sort of how you want to step it back from the facade if you're doing a dormer.

536
01:13:09,568 --> 01:13:14,450
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you would add a dormer so that it looks proportional to the house.

537
01:13:15,711 --> 01:13:29,158
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the sort of thing that we can certainly talk about, especially at that public meeting for the residential component of this, where we can say, here are different house styles, here are different things that you can do with them.

538
01:13:29,658 --> 01:13:41,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as we move into those four plus units, nine plus units, that sort of thing, the third story in some areas, there's a little bit more guidance about how that can be done.

539
01:13:41,262 --> 01:13:45,183
[SPEAKER_02]: We can certainly look at that and continuing diagramming that out.

540
01:13:45,643 --> 01:13:56,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as we start to narrow down the different uses in here, thinking about what the permitting process is for each of those will be really important.

541
01:13:56,506 --> 01:13:58,487
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done a little bit of internal conversations

542
01:13:58,847 --> 01:14:05,931
[SPEAKER_02]: but we wanted to make sure that we were set on the boundaries before we kind of got into the permitting processes portion of that.

543
01:14:06,472 --> 01:14:07,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, and that makes sense to me.

544
01:14:09,133 --> 01:14:27,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm really thinking about this NR2 when I'm thinking about, you know, if we want to activate the third story more, can we, you know, and like, I think going down the road of a design review board and mandatory design guidelines and everything is not what I'm suggesting, but I think

545
01:14:28,949 --> 01:14:30,550
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, advisory is interesting.

546
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:36,714
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't really have as much of an issue with that because I don't think it actually, it doesn't add process.

547
01:14:37,374 --> 01:14:53,664
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think maybe a mandatory something for, like for NR2, for the third story, like if you want more than two and a half, this is how you have to build it, might be something that is like a good nexus point of what we're talking about.

548
01:14:54,345 --> 01:14:57,647
[SPEAKER_09]: And my only other question, remind me in the,

549
01:14:58,469 --> 01:15:03,714
[SPEAKER_09]: what feels like years ago we called phase one changes that we passed I think last June.

550
01:15:04,494 --> 01:15:08,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we pass the site plan review where we have a tiered site plan review?

551
01:15:08,118 --> 01:15:11,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are we waiting on that?

552
01:15:11,881 --> 01:15:15,344
[SPEAKER_09]: There was like going to be a kind of an administrative review.

553
01:15:17,829 --> 01:15:21,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're still coordinating with Jonathan on that.

554
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:26,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the record, Jonathan is Silverstein's lawyer that we're working with at the legal aspects of this.

555
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, yeah, that's it.

556
01:15:28,433 --> 01:15:29,714
[SPEAKER_02]: We have it in April.

557
01:15:29,914 --> 01:15:30,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

558
01:15:30,634 --> 01:15:39,078
[SPEAKER_02]: We were sort of taking the steps to get all the pieces together and then coming back with that administrative review because we discussed it.

559
01:15:40,418 --> 01:15:46,342
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thresholds are important for that three tiers, and we wanted to complete this.

560
01:15:46,462 --> 01:15:49,464
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have looked at it, but I don't think we've fully passed to this point.

561
01:15:49,624 --> 01:15:52,125
[SPEAKER_09]: It just feels like it might be adjacent to this in some way.

562
01:15:52,365 --> 01:15:53,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.

563
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:03,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

564
01:16:03,271 --> 01:16:26,447
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that in the first proposal, then it was amended by President Bears, and I just wanted to kind of note that in the amended, sorry, in the proposal two, there are, interestingly, there is a part of the northern part of West Medford that even in the before amended proposal one,

565
01:16:28,103 --> 01:16:42,172
[SPEAKER_03]: was Neighborhood Residential 1, which was nothing but single-unit dwelling plus ADU and historic conversion, amended to be a larger portion that was only gonna be that.

566
01:16:42,712 --> 01:16:47,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And now in Proposal 2, it's actually Neighborhood Residential 2, and so it allows two units.

567
01:16:48,075 --> 01:16:53,799
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that portion, and when I look at the reality, there are no two-unit dwellings there.

568
01:16:54,219 --> 01:16:54,759
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that,

569
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:20,483
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want us to be careful that places, and I think this was the intention, President Bears, of the proposal that you made, which I was supportive of, please correct me if I'm wrong, but that in single-family areas that were single-family that are in fact single-family, there are no two units currently built there,

570
01:17:22,084 --> 01:17:37,897
[SPEAKER_03]: That I think I certainly felt that adding a to use and historic conversion was the right amount of change for those areas and I believe there are two areas, one is the northern part of North Medford and the other one is a triangle in Lawrence estates, but that both of those cases.

571
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:49,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would be totally like every resident there is like, yeah, let's have two fellows here but my guess is that that's probably not going to be the reaction that we get.

572
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:51,239
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that would be my.

573
01:17:52,981 --> 01:17:53,581
[SPEAKER_03]: inclination.

574
01:17:54,282 --> 01:18:02,987
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if other councillors would be supportive of that, but I think that was kind of what President Bears's amendment was going towards.

575
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:15,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wonder if we could, you know, come to some sort of agreement on whether we think that that's a good idea to roll it back, especially the northern west Medford part, roll it back to neighborhood residential planning.

576
01:18:16,454 --> 01:18:23,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you specify, Councilor Galleon, what's the part in West Medford that you're noting as neighborhood residential 2 that you thought was neighborhood residential 1?

577
01:18:23,077 --> 01:18:23,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

578
01:18:23,838 --> 01:18:38,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look at the difference between the proposed neighborhood residential districts version 1 and the amended proposal 1, and I believe that is President Bearsar's amendment,

579
01:18:40,227 --> 01:18:48,311
[SPEAKER_03]: in both of those, the very northern part of West Medford, that thing that goes way up by the lakes, right?

580
01:18:49,352 --> 01:18:55,014
[SPEAKER_03]: In both of those, it is neighborhood residential one, both in the original and also in the amended.

581
01:18:56,495 --> 01:19:02,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you now look at proposal two, that I believe is neighborhood residential two.

582
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:08,080
Go ahead.

583
01:19:08,905 --> 01:19:09,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

584
01:19:09,325 --> 01:19:34,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just to Councilor Callahan's point, I think for me, looking at the proposed districts over the residential types, that was kind of one of my also, I have a couple of questions about, again, some of those, that area, the west side of Forest Street, where there's an NR3 kind of square chunked off there, some of the boundaries of that large NR2 kind of in the middle.

585
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:55,434
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do think that there were some discussions that led to this proposal around the lot size and parking availability that I don't maybe necessarily agree with, but planning department folks and in the discussion saying,

586
01:19:56,268 --> 01:20:06,692
[SPEAKER_09]: when you look at the Fulton Heights with the elevations and the topography and the windy roads and the small lot size and the significant on-street parking already there, that doesn't make sense.

587
01:20:07,212 --> 01:20:24,978
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe there's some spots up on the north end of Grove Street and out down that neighborhood where you have lots of off-street parking, large lot sizes, and proximity to transit that doesn't exist in some

588
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:40,916
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm essentially making an argument that I don't fully agree with, but I've been characterizing some other arguments that were made that it might be more, the capacity is there, even if it's not necessarily an existing condition.

589
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:49,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I would tend to think that I think that that district should probably be two districts and be one part NR1 and one part NR2.

590
01:20:50,939 --> 01:20:52,220
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't want to

591
01:20:52,959 --> 01:20:58,141
[SPEAKER_09]: I will let the people who fully believe in that argument make that argument more robustly than I just did.

592
01:21:01,622 --> 01:21:05,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I could make a motion, but I don't know if a motion is really necessary.

593
01:21:05,304 --> 01:21:16,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if there's some consensus on this committee, then we can trust our Innocence Associates planners to do a slight revision.

594
01:21:17,695 --> 01:21:24,941
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it also makes sense at this point to kind of, as a segue off of that, to get specific on our next steps for this proposal overall.

595
01:21:25,642 --> 01:21:35,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I think that there's a couple notions for places where we'd want to see the sub-district assignments changed a little bit, that northern leg of West Medford being one of them.

596
01:21:36,771 --> 01:21:38,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I had another one that hasn't been mentioned so far.

597
01:21:39,673 --> 01:21:43,637
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that in terms of

598
01:21:45,178 --> 01:21:51,621
[SPEAKER_12]: How and where we go forward from here, I think we could certainly make additional amendments motions during this meeting asking for specific changes.

599
01:21:53,042 --> 01:22:02,786
[SPEAKER_12]: If Councilors wanted to state ideas and preferences on the record and then follow up before our next meeting through the chair to his associates, I think that that's that that would be another path.

600
01:22:06,595 --> 01:22:16,840
[SPEAKER_12]: we are going to be considering these sub-districts in the context of the map more fully fleshed out with the kind of broader conversation about urban residential one at our next meeting on this topic.

601
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:23,263
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that that will also be just a helpful piece of the conversation as the map gets more fully fleshed out and filled in.

602
01:22:23,283 --> 01:22:28,285
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it would be helpful for us to consider everything in the context of everything else.

603
01:22:28,405 --> 01:22:30,386
[SPEAKER_12]: So Emily, I'll go to you before I continue.

604
01:22:32,467 --> 01:22:32,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, wrong mic.

605
01:22:34,602 --> 01:22:35,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

606
01:22:35,383 --> 01:22:45,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think, uh, with respect to the Councilors, I don't think making a I think if you make a motion that makes the map feel more solid than it actually is right.

607
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,772
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an iterative process back and forth.

608
01:22:48,292 --> 01:22:58,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that hearing from all of you of their particular areas that you want to want us to look at more depth that I do want to also remind you, you know the criteria that

609
01:23:02,783 --> 01:23:17,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's what's existing, but also proximity to public transit, proximity to the higher job density areas, lot sizes, which President Bears mentioned, and what's existing, and also those transitions.

610
01:23:18,049 --> 01:23:25,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are more than happy to look at the edge lines, the boundary lines, more than happy to look at the areas that you pulled out.

611
01:23:26,452 --> 01:23:34,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want people listening to think that we're locked in at this point because we still have another month ahead of us talking about residential.

612
01:23:34,296 --> 01:23:37,137
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe we keep it a little bit more fluid for now.

613
01:23:37,637 --> 01:23:40,999
[SPEAKER_02]: That allows us to go back and forth with you more on that.

614
01:23:41,799 --> 01:23:42,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

615
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,540
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think that that makes sense.

616
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:49,563
[SPEAKER_12]: And certainly this is a draft and will remain a draft for several meetings more.

617
01:23:49,583 --> 01:23:51,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan.

618
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:52,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

619
01:23:52,687 --> 01:24:03,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I make a suggestion then that if a councilor wants to propose something that maybe we say, are there any objections to, then we don't have to vote or anything and people don't have to every single person chime in.

620
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:04,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit simpler.

621
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will make the first one.

622
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:15,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, are there any objections to the very northernmost part of West Bedford as it goes up Grove Street?

623
01:24:18,493 --> 01:24:30,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Somewhere in there, there being a boundary between Neighborhood Residential 1 and Neighborhood Residential 2, currently it's all Neighborhood Residential 2, let the furthest north part be Residential 1.

624
01:24:31,429 --> 01:24:36,455
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we can kind of look at the original proposal before the amendment.

625
01:24:37,525 --> 01:24:41,888
[SPEAKER_03]: that that may be a good place to look at for the differential between one and two.

626
01:24:42,889 --> 01:24:45,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Any objections to them making a change like that?

627
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:52,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think that we should use these sessions to, yeah, I think that the prevailing notion here is we're going to continue amending.

628
01:24:53,315 --> 01:24:57,716
[SPEAKER_12]: this map based on the concerns and preferences and questions voiced in this room.

629
01:24:58,076 --> 01:25:04,358
[SPEAKER_12]: And I suspect that this map will also will also continue to see an evolving version of this map based on the feedback that city staff has.

630
01:25:05,118 --> 01:25:16,041
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so it seems to me like there's consensus for going back to the original jumping off point and making sure that we're finessing the gradient between NR one and NR two and that location map specifically.

631
01:25:16,961 --> 01:25:17,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for raising that.

632
01:25:18,502 --> 01:25:22,323
[SPEAKER_12]: While we're talking about sub district boundaries, um,

633
01:25:25,278 --> 01:25:26,278
[SPEAKER_12]: just so that you have it.

634
01:25:26,378 --> 01:25:39,160
[SPEAKER_12]: One question that I did have looking at this, the South of Boston Ave, there's like a little dog leg of NR2 off of NR3, kind of straddling North Street.

635
01:25:40,901 --> 01:25:47,222
[SPEAKER_12]: That might be the rightest subdistrict for that area, but it looks pretty similar in character to me to the NR3 that it borders.

636
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:51,322
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm also curious about what Somerville zoning borders that area.

637
01:25:56,689 --> 01:26:05,957
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I wonder if it might just keep it consistent to upgrade that to NR3 if it's gonna be bounded on all sides by effectively NR3 zoning as well.

638
01:26:13,244 --> 01:26:17,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, conscious of the time, there is another committee meeting to start.

639
01:26:17,227 --> 01:26:22,292
[SPEAKER_12]: So are there any other, great, President Bears?

640
01:26:23,308 --> 01:26:23,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

641
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:25,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think I was the vice president.

642
01:26:25,633 --> 01:26:26,074
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

643
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:26,775
[SPEAKER_01]: My hands been up.

644
01:26:26,896 --> 01:26:27,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

645
01:26:27,537 --> 01:26:28,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you know.

646
01:26:28,138 --> 01:26:28,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

647
01:26:31,285 --> 01:26:32,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I defer to Councilors her belly.

648
01:26:33,038 --> 01:26:33,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

649
01:26:33,758 --> 01:26:34,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

650
01:26:34,118 --> 01:26:36,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Scarpelli.

651
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:37,540
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I apologize.

652
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:38,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's difficult being on zoom.

653
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:43,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want, I don't want to get too far away from what, what I represented for minutes said.

654
01:26:43,382 --> 01:26:51,806
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I just wanted to share a text message that I appreciate, uh, her clearing that up that right away, the residents saying, hold it.

655
01:26:52,206 --> 01:26:57,928
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so confused because what we're looking at right now on, um, on the shared, uh,

656
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:03,952
[SPEAKER_01]: videos that really can't even see what these areas and neighborhoods look like.

657
01:27:04,032 --> 01:27:14,097
[SPEAKER_01]: So just rest assured, I believe that we're not going to take anything of a vote or anything that's going to be moving anything in any direction.

658
01:27:14,137 --> 01:27:17,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we're asking for is to revisit and look at some options.

659
01:27:17,758 --> 01:27:24,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could just clarify that, Council Vice President, that'd be important for the viewing public.

660
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:24,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

661
01:27:26,195 --> 01:27:27,256
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

662
01:27:27,276 --> 01:27:28,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I apologize.

663
01:27:28,097 --> 01:27:28,737
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed your hand.

664
01:27:28,797 --> 01:27:29,818
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's exactly right.

665
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:31,859
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not taking any votes tonight.

666
01:27:31,899 --> 01:27:34,061
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not going to report this out of committee tonight.

667
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:37,464
[SPEAKER_12]: We're looking at a draft for the second time, not the last time.

668
01:27:37,524 --> 01:27:47,711
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I expect we'll have two more meetings on the residential topic in this committee before it goes further along in the public process to the CBP and public Q&A session.

669
01:27:47,791 --> 01:27:49,492
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for clarifying that.

670
01:27:50,193 --> 01:27:55,337
[SPEAKER_12]: This will most definitely see some more adjustments and revisions before it moves to the next step in the process.

671
01:27:55,897 --> 01:27:56,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

672
01:27:56,597 --> 01:27:56,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

673
01:27:56,897 --> 01:27:57,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Bears.

674
01:27:57,478 --> 01:27:59,879
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean to disrespect and cut you off.

675
01:27:59,939 --> 01:28:03,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make sure I didn't get too far so we could clarify.

676
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:03,860
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

677
01:28:04,741 --> 01:28:05,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you for the clarification.

678
01:28:06,621 --> 01:28:07,502
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears back to you.

679
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:08,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

680
01:28:08,302 --> 01:28:10,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I appreciate the clarification.

681
01:28:10,783 --> 01:28:18,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, could we look at the proposed zoning districts and existing residential types map just to be put that up on the screen?

682
01:28:22,497 --> 01:28:22,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

683
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:24,739
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, it is.

684
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:27,801
[SPEAKER_09]: The whole city.

685
01:28:27,841 --> 01:28:28,942
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to see.

686
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:31,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm zooming in a little bit myself here.

687
01:28:31,484 --> 01:28:43,132
[SPEAKER_09]: I think for me, the NR3 district, almost right in the center of the map, on the west side of Forest Street, it's a square.

688
01:28:43,152 --> 01:28:51,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, I can't annotate, but essentially,

689
01:28:52,678 --> 01:29:00,560
[SPEAKER_09]: there's this large NR2, there's an NR1, and then there's the NR3 between the highway and Forest Street that has a lot of the multifamily.

690
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:15,282
[SPEAKER_09]: The one on the other side of that, essentially, this bounding box here, I just think that given the existing condition, I would be able to proceed that as an NR2.

691
01:29:16,503 --> 01:29:18,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I just had two questions about

692
01:29:19,686 --> 01:29:27,148
[SPEAKER_09]: This square here, is that just a line that shouldn't be there?

693
01:29:29,249 --> 01:29:31,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is that because of its proximity to the square district?

694
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:33,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

695
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:35,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And is that intended to be an NR3?

696
01:29:38,092 --> 01:29:45,274
[SPEAKER_09]: And then here, this NR2, kind of on the backside, is that because that's like a subdivision that's all single family?

697
01:29:45,494 --> 01:29:45,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

698
01:29:46,895 --> 01:29:47,155
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

699
01:29:47,275 --> 01:29:47,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

700
01:29:52,602 --> 01:29:58,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, I was just talking about the NR3 district on the west side of Forest Street.

701
01:29:58,864 --> 01:30:08,287
[SPEAKER_09]: The small square district that is, I think, intended to be an NR3 on the northern end of, just north of the Medford Square area.

702
01:30:08,928 --> 01:30:11,489
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's an NR2 district off of Spring Street.

703
01:30:12,449 --> 01:30:19,211
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's because there's a subdivision there, a single family subdivision from, that's more recent than other construction in that area.

704
01:30:20,312 --> 01:30:21,632
[SPEAKER_09]: It's where the old train tracks were.

705
01:30:22,998 --> 01:30:25,742
[SPEAKER_09]: which I want to bring back, but sadly we can't.

706
01:30:26,603 --> 01:30:26,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

707
01:30:34,255 --> 01:30:34,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

708
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:35,556
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have that noted as well.

709
01:30:35,576 --> 01:30:37,219
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's well worth looking into as well.

710
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

711
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:50,947
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think this has been a really productive discussion around some of the boundaries and assignments for the sub-districts on this map, which is very much a draft.

712
01:30:51,107 --> 01:31:06,360
[SPEAKER_12]: And like we just said, we're gonna see a lot more opportunities for amendments and adjustments to this based on councilors' continuing feedback, concerns that we hear from the public that we digest and deliberate on, as well as input from city staff throughout this process.

713
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:17,049
[SPEAKER_12]: It is my understanding, and Emily and Paola, please correct me if you see this differently, that kind of our main step at this point is to be considering these sub-district boundaries.

714
01:31:17,149 --> 01:31:23,254
[SPEAKER_12]: And at our next meeting on this residential topic, we'll be talking more about the urban residential one and two sub-districts.

715
01:31:23,834 --> 01:31:32,422
[SPEAKER_12]: And after we start to feel more solid on an evolved version of this map, then we'll be talking about the permitting process, that by right, not by right.

716
01:31:33,743 --> 01:31:41,630
[SPEAKER_12]: per use for each sub-district, talking about dimensionals and standards and maybe even some design guidelines towards the tail end of this process.

717
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:45,073
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anything major that I'm missing from that workflow?

718
01:31:56,076 --> 01:32:04,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so I will happily reconsider all the comments that are coming through tonight.

719
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:15,987
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to remember that we are doing zoning and it's not for an aesthetic image of what is today, but that we are also looking into the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years.

720
01:32:19,569 --> 01:32:34,684
[SPEAKER_06]: So especially in around the squares where we do have mobility hubs where so we do have transit where we will have higher densities.

721
01:32:36,185 --> 01:32:41,991
[SPEAKER_06]: The districts that are around it will serve also like a transition towards

722
01:32:44,616 --> 01:32:47,237
[SPEAKER_06]: single unit dwelling districts.

723
01:32:47,997 --> 01:32:50,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So just that to also keep in mind.

724
01:32:51,258 --> 01:32:54,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are job density.

725
01:32:54,759 --> 01:32:57,140
[SPEAKER_06]: That is also something that we have in mind.

726
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in this presentation.

727
01:32:59,881 --> 01:33:02,822
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the map that is coming from the comprehensive plan.

728
01:33:03,482 --> 01:33:07,624
[SPEAKER_06]: So that we also like to have it in consideration as well.

729
01:33:09,284 --> 01:33:10,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So just those two for the rest.

730
01:33:12,989 --> 01:33:17,852
[SPEAKER_06]: We, in any case, we will continue to look into this parcel by parcel.

731
01:33:18,853 --> 01:33:19,473
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Paola.

732
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:25,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think this is certainly a phase of the process where there are a lot of information sources informing the evolving draft.

733
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:29,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will just add two things.

734
01:33:30,281 --> 01:33:45,345
[SPEAKER_02]: One is certainly the the long term aspect that Paula mentioned of zoning I think the the concerns about zoning and the frustration about zoning is that it never happens as quickly as people think it's going to happen and so that's something else to

735
01:33:46,045 --> 01:33:47,286
[SPEAKER_02]: to think about and remember.

736
01:33:47,847 --> 01:33:53,352
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of the process, what we'd like to do is we're going to look at our calendars.

737
01:33:53,412 --> 01:33:55,894
[SPEAKER_02]: We will coordinate with city planning staff.

738
01:33:56,414 --> 01:34:07,564
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point before this committee's last meeting on residential, we do want to have that public meeting where these maps, which it's great to be able to see them on screen.

739
01:34:07,884 --> 01:34:11,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to be able to zoom into them when they're online as well.

740
01:34:12,328 --> 01:34:15,331
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's something nice about having somebody explain it to you in person.

741
01:34:15,411 --> 01:34:26,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be looking for that date and that place when we can have the conversation and have these maps up at a size that people can point to and put stickers on and ask us questions about as well.

742
01:34:26,642 --> 01:34:28,624
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have that date for you soon.

743
01:34:28,984 --> 01:34:29,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

744
01:34:29,325 --> 01:34:30,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, Emily.

745
01:34:30,145 --> 01:34:33,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that mapping workshop that we did over the summer, kind of before we got into the

746
01:34:34,597 --> 01:34:44,423
[SPEAKER_12]: The heavy lifting of the geography proposals was really helpful, and I think it'd be great to have another version of that as we're mid-process.

747
01:34:45,023 --> 01:34:45,964
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for working on that.

748
01:34:51,927 --> 01:34:52,167
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

749
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:57,811
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can expect to see an updated version of this proposal in two weeks, along with more discussion on the urban

750
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:04,183
[SPEAKER_12]: residential subdistricts one and two, and we will take things from there.

751
01:35:04,203 --> 01:35:09,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the intervening time, hopefully we will see some more new communication strategies rolled out.

752
01:35:09,906 --> 01:35:15,670
[SPEAKER_12]: And we, of course, have the public meeting on the Salem Street Neighborhood Corridor District proposal to look forward to as well.

753
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:20,573
[SPEAKER_12]: And green score will be discussed in CBB on February 5th, but Salem Street will not.

754
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:26,617
[SPEAKER_12]: That will be continued until March 5th to allow more time for public comment and Q&A.

755
01:35:29,673 --> 01:35:33,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any further questions or comments from Councilors before I go to public participation?

756
01:35:38,517 --> 01:35:44,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, I'll go first to Zoom, because there are some folks who have had their hands up for a very long time, and then I will go to the podium.

757
01:35:46,041 --> 01:35:48,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Gaston, name and address for the record, please.

758
01:35:48,102 --> 01:35:48,702
[SPEAKER_12]: You have three minutes.

759
01:35:50,048 --> 01:35:51,629
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

760
01:35:51,669 --> 01:35:53,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaston Fiore 61, Stigney Road.

761
01:35:53,871 --> 01:36:03,537
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I would like to thank and agree with Councilor Callaghan's change of the portion of Northwest Medford from NR2 to NR1.

762
01:36:04,798 --> 01:36:15,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Second of all, I think same treatment could be applied to the area of Lawrence Estate, south of Lawrence Road between to the west of Governor's

763
01:36:16,785 --> 01:36:21,189
[SPEAKER_10]: and maybe up to Rural Avenue on the west or even Winthrop.

764
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:29,457
[SPEAKER_10]: That area, as can be seen on slide 22, it's currently mostly single family.

765
01:36:29,557 --> 01:36:31,779
[SPEAKER_10]: The topography is kind of weird.

766
01:36:31,839 --> 01:36:34,781
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you see like Summit Road doesn't even connect to anything.

767
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:39,305
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty of roads that sort of, it's not like a grid or anything like that.

768
01:36:39,325 --> 01:36:41,467
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very peculiar neighborhood.

769
01:36:41,507 --> 01:36:41,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I love it.

770
01:36:43,749 --> 01:36:54,658
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would encourage the planners and the city councilors as well to re-look at the NR2 portion down of Lawrence.

771
01:36:54,918 --> 01:37:04,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe not all the way down to High Street, I don't know, but definitely a little bit farther south from Lawrence Road than what it is before.

772
01:37:04,526 --> 01:37:07,989
[SPEAKER_10]: And lastly, so just a clarification.

773
01:37:09,830 --> 01:37:15,974
[SPEAKER_10]: To the east of Governor's Hub, right to the east, that's still Lawrence Estates, is that correct?

774
01:37:16,134 --> 01:37:28,462
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's say, so I'm on slide 21, it says Lawrence Estates, so let's say to the east of Governor's and west of Forest Street, that's still Lawrence Estates, correct?

775
01:37:31,726 --> 01:37:40,508
[SPEAKER_12]: More or less than if I believe if you scroll up in the PowerPoint from the slide that was last screen shared, there is a earlier version of the map.

776
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it is okay.

777
01:37:43,349 --> 01:37:54,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so I'm on a test to make sure we understand that some site 21 title proposal to neighborhood residential and that so West of Governors Ave.

778
01:37:55,832 --> 01:37:56,872
[SPEAKER_10]: It goes all the way to 93.

779
01:37:56,992 --> 01:38:01,013
[SPEAKER_10]: But let's say, you know, I'm just talking about the area on Lawrence Estates, for example.

780
01:38:01,878 --> 01:38:08,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was said at the beginning of the meeting that there's no such thing as proposing a triple-decker in Lawrence Estates.

781
01:38:08,743 --> 01:38:12,585
[SPEAKER_10]: And that, according to the current proposal, the proposal is incorrect.

782
01:38:12,925 --> 01:38:19,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that area of Lawrence Estates is NR3, and NR3 leads three-unit dwelling townhouse.

783
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:28,676
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when I go to the previous slide, residential requirement, that's slide 28, NR3, I'm seeing a triple-decker right there.

784
01:38:29,788 --> 01:38:37,990
[SPEAKER_10]: So when it was said that people might be a little bit concerned about triple-deckers in Lawrence, they said that's misinformation.

785
01:38:38,590 --> 01:38:47,493
[SPEAKER_10]: According to the current proposal, so the second proposal, and the residential requirements slide 28, that is not misinformation at all.

786
01:38:47,553 --> 01:38:48,733
[SPEAKER_10]: That is correct information.

787
01:38:48,853 --> 01:38:52,434
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be in the future triple-deckers in Lawrence Estates.

788
01:38:53,114 --> 01:38:55,276
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to put it out there.

789
01:38:55,816 --> 01:39:01,481
[SPEAKER_10]: And if people are concerned about that, I encourage them to voice their concerns.

790
01:39:03,182 --> 01:39:04,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much, Mr. Stone.

791
01:39:04,343 --> 01:39:07,765
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll make sure to note that as this goes forward in the process.

792
01:39:07,785 --> 01:39:08,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for your comments.

793
01:39:08,726 --> 01:39:09,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the opportunity.

794
01:39:11,468 --> 01:39:12,089
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, President Bears.

795
01:39:17,113 --> 01:39:18,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

796
01:39:18,153 --> 01:39:22,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just to that comment, that is the square box that I was suggesting should be

797
01:39:23,340 --> 01:39:24,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Not marked as an R3.

798
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:29,022
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think we don't have defined neighborhood boundaries.

799
01:39:31,302 --> 01:39:36,643
[SPEAKER_09]: One could argue that the Lawrence Estate starts at that intersection and goes to the intersection at Winthrop Street.

800
01:39:36,724 --> 01:39:42,245
[SPEAKER_09]: We could have an argument about that for a year, and I'm sure everyone in the neighborhood would have a different opinion on it.

801
01:39:43,773 --> 01:40:01,840
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, it seems to me that that bounding district between Governors Ave, Lawrence Road, and Forest Street, and what looks to be Hall and, oh, Street that I'm blanking on, that that should at least be more part of the NR2.

802
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:08,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And as Gaston noted, I think looking at the boundary line of that NR2 district and seeing if it should be

803
01:40:10,216 --> 01:40:11,277
[SPEAKER_09]: moved further south.

804
01:40:11,517 --> 01:40:16,739
[SPEAKER_09]: The NR1, NR2 boundary that's currently on Lawrence Road I think is certainly worth considering.

805
01:40:19,301 --> 01:40:19,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

806
01:40:19,681 --> 01:40:21,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

807
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:23,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Bearsia.

808
01:40:23,123 --> 01:40:27,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly, that's an area that we want to pay special attention to as we continue to finesse these boundaries.

809
01:40:28,105 --> 01:40:30,767
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll go next to the podium and then back to Zoom.

810
01:40:31,787 --> 01:40:32,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address

811
01:40:34,657 --> 01:40:35,898
[SPEAKER_12]: for the record, please.

812
01:40:36,478 --> 01:40:39,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I forgot that the microphone was all the way over there.

813
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:40,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

814
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:41,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Adjusted something.

815
01:40:41,821 --> 01:40:43,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'll be loud or quiet or something.

816
01:40:43,442 --> 01:40:43,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know.

817
01:40:45,003 --> 01:40:47,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, William Navarre, 108 Bedford Street.

818
01:40:47,204 --> 01:40:48,424
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I made myself loud.

819
01:40:48,444 --> 01:40:50,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, OK.

820
01:40:50,185 --> 01:40:59,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

821
01:41:02,172 --> 01:41:02,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Try it again, William.

822
01:41:03,559 --> 01:41:03,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello?

823
01:41:04,299 --> 01:41:04,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's better.

824
01:41:05,619 --> 01:41:07,600
[SPEAKER_08]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

825
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:12,961
[SPEAKER_08]: So a couple of things I wanted to talk about.

826
01:41:12,981 --> 01:41:26,983
[SPEAKER_08]: The first and probably the most important that I've been sort of thinking about for a long time is when we have this max building coverage, I really think that should be replaced with a slightly larger number that is max building plus parking.

827
01:41:28,243 --> 01:41:31,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Just because I, it's very hard to say like,

828
01:41:31,965 --> 01:41:38,809
[SPEAKER_08]: If the goal of this is to protect the environment, it's very hard to say, well, it'd be fine as long as you made the buildings smaller and put in more parking.

829
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:44,552
[SPEAKER_08]: If the goal is to protect the environment, protect the permeable surfaces, we're upset about permeable.

830
01:41:44,592 --> 01:41:45,713
[SPEAKER_08]: That doesn't make any sense.

831
01:41:46,753 --> 01:41:49,455
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing this kind of thing could encourage less parking.

832
01:41:49,975 --> 01:41:53,017
[SPEAKER_08]: We could have an incentive to encourage the ribbon parking.

833
01:41:53,037 --> 01:41:57,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, the zoning says we prefer ribbon parking, but there's no actual incentive.

834
01:41:59,253 --> 01:42:08,007
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets underground parking, which I know some people like so I think that would be better and that way there's more flexibility, you know, instead of saying.

835
01:42:09,271 --> 01:42:10,792
[SPEAKER_08]: 50% building coverage, you say 75.

836
01:42:12,113 --> 01:42:13,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what numbers actually work.

837
01:42:13,994 --> 01:42:16,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever numbers work, you say that's your coverage.

838
01:42:17,176 --> 01:42:19,417
[SPEAKER_08]: You cover that with parking or you cover it with building.

839
01:42:19,437 --> 01:42:20,017
[SPEAKER_08]: That's up to you.

840
01:42:20,037 --> 01:42:20,918
[SPEAKER_08]: You have flexibility.

841
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:22,439
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'd be my first suggestion.

842
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:28,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also say that I was weighing in on this sort of Grove Street discussion.

843
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:31,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that you can imagine like a

844
01:42:32,243 --> 01:42:35,205
[SPEAKER_08]: South Bedford style duplex in Grove Street.

845
01:42:35,225 --> 01:42:36,626
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds kind of ridiculous.

846
01:42:37,687 --> 01:42:42,811
[SPEAKER_08]: But not all duplexes have to look like a South Bedford style duplex.

847
01:42:42,931 --> 01:42:54,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe there could be some kind of a, I sort of joked, maybe a manor zoning where it has to look like a stately single family home, but there could be duplex or even more inside.

848
01:42:56,083 --> 01:43:02,586
[SPEAKER_08]: but you're not going to build triple-decker style, which would admittedly look ridiculous there.

849
01:43:04,427 --> 01:43:24,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe you could even imagine a super historical conversion, where we basically say that you could do a historical conversion, but you're allowed to make some, maybe you're allowed to make modifications to the back or something, to basically have that, just a little extra flexibility where the lots are quite big and the neighborhood can handle it.

850
01:43:26,088 --> 01:43:29,891
[SPEAKER_08]: but where a South Bedford style duplex would look silly.

851
01:43:32,072 --> 01:43:33,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, those are the comments.

852
01:43:33,073 --> 01:43:33,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

853
01:43:35,635 --> 01:43:36,855
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for your comments, William.

854
01:43:41,799 --> 01:43:42,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Back to Zoom.

855
01:43:42,439 --> 01:43:43,880
[SPEAKER_12]: I recognize you, Michael.

856
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

857
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:46,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And you have three minutes.

858
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.

859
01:43:52,240 --> 01:43:54,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Cabral, 11 Jackson Road.

860
01:43:55,082 --> 01:44:02,766
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a land use zoning attorney, and full disclosure, I do appear before Medford boards from time to time.

861
01:44:04,006 --> 01:44:05,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all this information.

862
01:44:05,487 --> 01:44:06,568
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very helpful.

863
01:44:06,628 --> 01:44:10,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to Councilor Callahan for again bringing up

864
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,992
[SPEAKER_00]: the West Medford NR1 district.

865
01:44:14,813 --> 01:44:16,795
[SPEAKER_00]: I received quite a few questions on that.

866
01:44:17,335 --> 01:44:28,485
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding was that that would go to NR1 also, you know, discussing the boundaries of that West Medford area as well.

867
01:44:28,905 --> 01:44:36,232
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certainly some that are still in the NR2, say north of Sagamore Ave and south of Grove Street that

868
01:44:36,912 --> 01:44:55,038
[SPEAKER_00]: are all single family right now there are no two families on the street at all i would ask the council to consider that or at least um some justification as to why some of those would be two and potentially three heading down towards high street uh right now that would certainly

869
01:44:55,698 --> 01:44:57,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.:

870
01:44:57,699 --> 01:45:06,263
[SPEAKER_00]: : be a significant change to that neighborhood also my hope would be, and I know not for this hearing, but you know, as someone who appears before.

871
01:45:06,283 --> 01:45:07,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.:

872
01:45:07,563 --> 01:45:12,986
[SPEAKER_00]: : Numerous zoning boards these changes are are great and certainly you know welcomed, but I think where.

873
01:45:14,905 --> 01:45:26,277
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of what really matters here is getting into the dimensional controls in the pre-existing non-conformity nature that will be in the zoning ordinance as well.

874
01:45:27,318 --> 01:45:34,566
[SPEAKER_00]: We see, and I'm sure you know, quite frequently we've got a lot size in a GR district right now, minimums are 6,000.

875
01:45:36,107 --> 01:45:43,874
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can put a two family as of right, but we have a lot size of say 4000 square feet.

876
01:45:44,815 --> 01:45:52,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping part of the goal here will be to relieve owners developers.

877
01:45:53,002 --> 01:46:05,094
[SPEAKER_00]: from having to go before the zoning board looking for variances to go before zoning or community development and look for special permits for parking.

878
01:46:06,675 --> 01:46:07,636
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, think this.

879
01:46:08,814 --> 01:46:29,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Wholesale zoning change will be great, but I would encourage and I'm hopeful that we reverse engineer this in a way so that we can prevent these additional administrative processes and make it easier for people to make these changes, to implement these changes, to not have to worry about

880
01:46:30,765 --> 01:46:44,575
[SPEAKER_00]: going back to get a variance, okay, my house now complies, but there are parking buffers that the zoning bylaw requires that there's no way we could certainly meet on a lot this size when we just put in a two or three family as well.

881
01:46:44,615 --> 01:46:57,604
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hopeful that after all this is said and done, we work the dimensional requirements, we look at those, the law coverage, and then back into whether all of this actually makes sense

882
01:46:58,626 --> 01:47:10,237
[SPEAKER_00]: because we might just be back in the same spot that we're in right now or after all this time and effort that all you folks are putting in, which is, again, is appreciated.

883
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:18,704
[SPEAKER_00]: And just a few more notes here, one on the historical conversion with the last speaker as well, that may need a tweak there as to

884
01:47:19,485 --> 01:47:37,970
[SPEAKER_00]: allow some minor modifications to the exterior for example to add a porch or an entry for that second entry there under our current zoning right now if you put a covered porch or even just a small entryway and again if that's covered and posted down that does require a variance

885
01:47:39,810 --> 01:47:43,231
[SPEAKER_00]: from the zoning board if you cannot meet your setbacks there.

886
01:47:43,291 --> 01:47:46,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just pose that for consideration.

887
01:47:46,572 --> 01:47:50,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on the dimensional front, I did not see frontage on there.

888
01:47:50,633 --> 01:47:53,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Is frontage being done away with?

889
01:47:53,334 --> 01:47:58,116
[SPEAKER_00]: And my question would be, so how would that work with

890
01:47:59,025 --> 01:48:03,767
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially creating new lots or putting multiple lots, excuse me, multiple houses on a large lot.

891
01:48:04,547 --> 01:48:17,352
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, as some of the Councilors have already mentioned, if there's one central location for us to find documents prior to these hearings would be greatly appreciated.

892
01:48:17,672 --> 01:48:18,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Many thanks to the

893
01:48:19,373 --> 01:48:30,997
[SPEAKER_00]: community development department for sending me this proposal in advance this morning, but it was not under where most of the zoning amendments and documents have been in the past, so it was a little difficult to find.

894
01:48:31,437 --> 01:48:33,918
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be, again, appreciated.

895
01:48:33,938 --> 01:48:38,579
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you again all for your time and efforts on these matters.

896
01:48:40,046 --> 01:48:44,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for your comments, Michael appreciate this awful commentary, and we'll be sure to.

897
01:48:45,768 --> 01:49:00,114
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure a lot of that will come up in our future discussions of dimensionals and making sure that this zoning is what we want it to be which is implementable and creating a more streamlined process for people to build the type of properties that we know that we in the community want to see here in Medford.

898
01:49:03,065 --> 01:49:09,168
[SPEAKER_12]: meeting materials are almost always posted on the City Council public portal ahead of the meeting times.

899
01:49:10,089 --> 01:49:16,112
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are working to populate that updated zoning website so that that'll be a more useful information source as well.

900
01:49:17,093 --> 01:49:19,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Go next to Wren on Zoom.

901
01:49:19,254 --> 01:49:20,735
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna ask you to unmute, please.

902
01:49:21,015 --> 01:49:24,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and their hand just went down.

903
01:49:24,437 --> 01:49:28,579
[SPEAKER_12]: So please raise your hand again if you do have, okay.

904
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:30,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address for the record, please.

905
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:31,821
[SPEAKER_12]: And you're gonna have three minutes.

906
01:49:35,094 --> 01:49:36,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there, Ren Bean, 37 Woodrow Avenue.

907
01:49:38,295 --> 01:49:49,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with what the previous fellow just said about a central place to find all these changes, rather than materials associated with a particular meeting, especially since they're iterative.

908
01:49:50,477 --> 01:49:57,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Having a central place for like, here's the most up-to-date thing we've talked about, rather than needing to trawl through and figure out, has it been updated?

909
01:49:58,058 --> 01:50:00,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is the one from three weeks ago still the most recent one?

910
01:50:00,319 --> 01:50:02,759
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd just make life a lot easier for people trying to follow these changes.

911
01:50:03,489 --> 01:50:10,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I thought the map, I believe the one that the council emphasize, hey, everyone should be looking at this one.

912
01:50:10,999 --> 01:50:13,723
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the one that really tells the story was super duper helpful.

913
01:50:13,743 --> 01:50:20,351
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really great graphic of what's there now and what it might become based on current usage and future zoning.

914
01:50:22,225 --> 01:50:32,396
[SPEAKER_07]: would, if it's possible, or if it's easy to produce for, I'm guessing it'd be INA's associates, to provide an accompanying table of like the maximum possible change based on all the proposals.

915
01:50:33,196 --> 01:50:44,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that would really help the neighborhoods around the city sort of digest and think about what the scope of change being proposed is, because I, you know, based on what I'm hearing in a lot of these conversations, people are

916
01:50:44,728 --> 01:50:56,957
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of assuming a scope of change much greater than I think what a lot of is being proposed, especially when you drill down into like, you know, what's allowable based on the nitty gritty.

917
01:50:56,977 --> 01:51:05,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yes, the headline is, we might allow another story, or you might get incentive bonus for doing certain things up to X number of stories.

918
01:51:05,142 --> 01:51:06,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And that sounds really scary.

919
01:51:06,663 --> 01:51:08,665
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you drill down on the lot level and say, well, actually,

920
01:51:09,245 --> 01:51:11,707
[SPEAKER_07]: it's already non-conforming.

921
01:51:11,727 --> 01:51:17,473
[SPEAKER_07]: 50% of this is already non-conforming at where we're zoning it to.

922
01:51:17,573 --> 01:51:19,775
[SPEAKER_07]: So the maximum change is only the other 50%.

923
01:51:19,815 --> 01:51:22,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, when you look at the lot sizes, they can't even do this.

924
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:27,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think a table with data saying

925
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:33,072
[SPEAKER_07]: lot by lot, this is the maximum change under the proposal that people could see.

926
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:50,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would also be helpful in comparing neighborhoods, because one concern I have hearing this discussion about West Medford is, you know, the lot sizes are bigger there, you know, even allowing two units wouldn't be

927
01:51:51,414 --> 01:52:12,491
[SPEAKER_07]: uh as much of a change as going from two to three units in a lot of the areas in east medford that are being proposed and i think um there you know there there runs the risk of of uh stoking some uh neighborhood versus neighborhood animosity about some folks feeling more affected than others by these city-wide changes and having that data to say no the scale of change is about the same from neighborhood to neighborhood

928
01:52:13,171 --> 01:52:24,162
[SPEAKER_07]: have it be guided by data rather than kind of the sense and the vibe walking around the neighborhood, you know, because I think these are material changes for people's lives and homeowners and residents.

929
01:52:24,262 --> 01:52:32,590
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I think this is generally really great and thoughtful and, you know, beyond the visual, I think data would also really inform the conversation.

930
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:34,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you all very much for the efforts.

931
01:52:36,443 --> 01:52:49,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you so much for that commentary run I really hear you on those specific diagrams that you mentioned and we're working to see how we can operationalize that for all of our proposals going forward as I agree, I think that's really helpful visual tool for people.

932
01:52:52,578 --> 01:52:55,302
[SPEAKER_12]: go back to Enos Associates.

933
01:52:56,583 --> 01:52:57,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

934
01:52:57,845 --> 01:53:02,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to answer two questions before we move forward just so we don't lose them.

935
01:53:02,451 --> 01:53:03,812
[SPEAKER_02]: One is we are looking at frontage.

936
01:53:03,852 --> 01:53:06,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just focusing on some of the other the dimensional standards.

937
01:53:07,016 --> 01:53:10,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are a little bit more familiar with, but we've not lost sight of that.

938
01:53:11,041 --> 01:53:26,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other is we're pretty sure Ren has a bug in our office because we were having a very similar conversation about showing sort of neighborhood by neighborhood data on density and impacts this afternoon, actually.

939
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:28,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Ren, for those thoughts.

940
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:33,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to hear that in many ways they're very similar to ones that we've been talking about as well.

941
01:53:38,417 --> 01:53:41,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you so much for those clarifications, Emily.

942
01:53:44,722 --> 01:53:46,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I see no further public participation.

943
01:53:47,885 --> 01:53:59,236
[SPEAKER_12]: So just again to recap, at our next committee meeting, which I don't know the date for that off the top of our head, but it'll be in two weeks, we are going to talk more about the residential proposal, the more, February 12th.

944
01:54:00,771 --> 01:54:02,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Great day to talk about neighborhood residential.

945
01:54:02,472 --> 01:54:09,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Before that, we will have the public Q&A on the Salem Street Neighborhood Court District, February 5th, 6.30 p.m.

946
01:54:09,756 --> 01:54:10,296
[SPEAKER_12]: at the Roberts.

947
01:54:11,696 --> 01:54:16,299
[SPEAKER_12]: And we are continuing to work on shipping more of these updated, what'd you say?

948
01:54:16,899 --> 01:54:19,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, February 10th, not February 5th.

949
01:54:20,281 --> 01:54:22,662
[SPEAKER_12]: February 5th is when the CDB will not be talking about

950
01:54:23,726 --> 01:54:25,887
[SPEAKER_12]: be talking about other exciting concepts.

951
01:54:26,587 --> 01:54:32,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Every attempt is the public you and I. Well, since I'm starting to misspeak, I think this would be a great time for a motion to adjourn.

952
01:54:34,149 --> 01:54:37,570
[SPEAKER_12]: On the motion on the motion to adjourn by President Bears seconded by Councilor Callahan.

953
01:54:38,850 --> 01:54:39,530
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor.

954
01:54:41,771 --> 01:54:42,231
[SPEAKER_12]: All this post.

955
01:54:42,311 --> 01:54:42,611
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

956
01:54:42,631 --> 01:54:43,611
[SPEAKER_12]: There should be a voice vote because

957
01:54:47,683 --> 01:54:47,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

958
01:54:48,743 --> 01:54:49,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

959
01:54:49,524 --> 01:54:49,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

960
01:54:49,944 --> 01:54:50,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, George.

961
01:54:50,484 --> 01:54:53,065
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Councilor Callahan.

962
01:54:54,726 --> 01:54:55,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Meeting is adjourned.

963
01:54:55,866 --> 01:54:56,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, everybody.

964
01:54:56,667 --> 01:54:59,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, NS Associates, for your thoughtful stewardship, as always.
