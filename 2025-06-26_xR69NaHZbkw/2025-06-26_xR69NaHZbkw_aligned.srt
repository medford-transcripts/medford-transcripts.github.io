00:00:02,326 --> 00:00:03,106
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:03,146 --> 00:00:04,707
Thanks for joining us tonight.

3
00:00:06,368 --> 00:00:07,769
My name is Andre LaRue.

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:10,271
I'm the chair of the Medford Community Development Board.

5
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:19,156
And welcome to the December 9th meeting of the Community Development Board.

6
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:26,780
What we are doing today is tackling our continued public hearing on zoning.

7
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,162
And let me just read.

8
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:35,059
It's going.

9
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:41,565
Public hearing notice.

10
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:44,888
City of Medford Mass Community Development Board.

11
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:48,131
Chapter 94 zoning.

12
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:52,214
The original hearing notice was for November 18, 2021.

13
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:59,501
Actually, before we read the hearing notice, let me just take a

22
00:02:11,576 --> 00:02:15,257
Let me take a roll call attendance of the board members.

23
00:02:17,617 --> 00:02:21,699
And board member, when I call your name, just say present.

24
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:23,379
Deanna Peabody.

25
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:24,679
Present.

26
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,520
David Blumberg.

27
00:02:27,505 --> 00:02:28,345
Present.

28
00:02:29,306 --> 00:02:29,686

33
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:47,474
So, I think I got everybody.

34
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:50,815
All the board members who are here.

35
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:04,265
We'll go back to the public hearing notice.

36
00:03:11,168 --> 00:03:19,453
So public hearing notice, City of Medford Mass Community Development Board, Chapter 94 zoning, November 18th, 2021 was when the hearing was opened.

37
00:03:20,053 --> 00:03:25,336
Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Thursday, November 18th, 2021 after 6 p.m.

38
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:28,018
That was continued to tonight, December 9th,

39
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:29,717
at 6 p.m.

40
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:34,640
via Zoom remote video conferencing to take the following actions with regard to the zoning ordinance.

41
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:45,705
Delete the existing ordinance in its entirety and replace with the proposed ordinance as referred to our board by the city council.

42
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:56,431
The full text of the proposed ordinance can be viewed in the office of the city clerk in city hall 103 or on the city's website at the planning

43
00:03:57,151 --> 00:04:04,157
development sustainability department page and look for the tab current CD board filings.

44
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:09,962
So at this time, I will call the continued hearing

45
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:11,711
open.

46
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:24,705
And what we'll do today because we only have limited time with Attorney Bobrowski is that we will do our best to get through the remainder of the proposal we got about halfway through in November.

47
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:30,872
And if we can at least get through his presentation and explanation will take

48
00:04:31,753 --> 00:04:42,158
question will go section by section and take questions and comments from the Community Development Board members and then allow members of the public to weigh in as well.

49
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:48,381
But if we can try to get this done in an hour and a half, if possible, that would be great.

50
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:57,145
So maybe limit full discussion so that we can, after Attorney Bobrowski leaves, we could continue to

51
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:03,708
to talk for some time and identify the areas that we want to dig into a little bit more.

52
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:25,859
But our goal here will be to, I think, gather as much feedback as possible from board members and members of the public, and then compile it into a set of recommendations that we can come back after the holiday, the beginning of January, and finalize that feedback and send it on to the city council.

53
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:31,264
All right, Attorney Bobrowski, let me turn it over to you.

54
00:05:31,944 --> 00:05:32,324
Thank you.

55
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:41,707
Amanda, if you would put on the current version, which I believe is draft nine to the section 6.3.

56
00:05:42,448 --> 00:05:49,590
While Amanda's queuing it up, let me say a few words about where we're headed tonight.

57
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:57,072
The old ordinance really has no performance standards for anything but the MUZ district.

58
00:05:57,345 --> 00:06:07,508
there are very few performance standards that would talk about anything other than signs, which is section 6.2, the parking before that 6.1.

59
00:06:08,548 --> 00:06:15,791
And so in section 6.3 and 6.4, Amanda, you can scroll down through that sign section, it's pretty long.

60
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:21,152
In section 6.3, we introduced landscaping and screening standards.

61
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:26,474
And the idea here is that these standards would apply to anything that requires

62
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:31,351
a special permit or site plan approval.

63
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:36,212
I need to actually amend that applicability section to add that sentence.

64
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,994
I've made a note to myself with regard to that.

65
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:53,237
It would say applicability when the city council, zoning board of appeals or community development board is granting either a special permit or site plan approval,

66
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:57,130
this consistency with this section would be required.

67
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:03,675
It's not intended to be something applicable to residential homes, single family or two family homes.

68
00:07:04,936 --> 00:07:09,979
So much of what starts this section 631 to 634 is existing.

69
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,744
And if you scroll down, you can see that this has just been renumbered and put in here.

70
00:07:16,544 --> 00:07:20,467
So you can go to 635, which is this beginning of the change.

71
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,713
Beginning here at 635 I've added some new sections for your consideration large parking areas.

72
00:07:27,273 --> 00:07:40,039
So, spaces over 20 spaces have one shade tree pretend parking spaces this is your typical standard today for parking in lots that have more than 10 spaces retaining walls can be used.

73
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:54,281
We want all unsightly areas, including refuse disposal facilities, HVAC equipment, service areas, truck loading areas, utility buildings to be screened from view from neighboring properties and streets.

74
00:07:55,221 --> 00:08:00,163
Maintenance is required here with regard to landscaping.

75
00:08:00,743 --> 00:08:05,344
So it's not, you know, you can't just plan it once and let it die and then figure you did your job.

76
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:06,344
You've got to keep it up.

77
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,545
Visibility requirements talks about

78
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:14,765
corner visibility so you don't want anything blocking sight distance at an intersection.

79
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:25,631
And like signs and special permits, the SPGA or the Community Development Board, if the use does not require a special permit, may, by special permit, waive the provisions of this section.

80
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:29,152
So there's flexibility in mind here for the business community.

81
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:36,636
If they've got something that works just as well and they can ask for a waiver by special permit and it goes on from there.

82
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:46,810
So I'll stop there because we're about to head into one of the bigger changes, which is section 6.4, and ask if there are any questions.

83
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:55,392
Members of the board, do you have any questions or comments?

84
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:00,833
Andre, this is David, I have a question.

85
00:09:01,613 --> 00:09:02,053
Hi, David.

86
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:05,094
Question is on 6.3.11,

87
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:20,803
on the standard for the SPGA or Community Development Board to, I guess, well, to reduce or waive the requirements of the section.

88
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:29,011
And we see the standard in connection with parking, we see signage, it's something that recurs throughout the draft.

89
00:09:30,973 --> 00:09:32,795
And I guess my question is, is that to,

90
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,862
this question to myself, whether that's too broad.

91
00:09:36,882 --> 00:09:55,268
I definitely see the value in having some discretion, but I wonder if the discretion should be focused with some guide rails on it, such that like, okay, well, maybe you don't have as many shade trees, but you have more screening or less screening, but more shade trees.

92
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:55,508
So

93
00:09:56,707 --> 00:10:02,910
I wonder if, to me, 6311 is a little bit too discretionary.

94
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:08,433
I feel like that that would leave the board the discretion to not enforce any of the requirements.

95
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:21,200
Whereas I feel like it would be more appropriate if there was some offset required or some sense that one shortcoming is made up by an improvement on another category.

96
00:10:23,682 --> 00:10:25,603
I can certainly understand your position.

97
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:34,979
know, boards change over time and one board's sense of propriety might not be the next memberships.

98
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,363
So I can take a crack at putting some guardrails, as you called it.

99
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:46,427
But the basic principle is that I'm really tired of going to

100
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:54,852
ZBA meetings at which somebody needs a bigger sign and they have to walk through the variance criteria, which just should never apply.

101
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:58,834
You can't have a bigger sign because of soil condition, shape, or topography.

102
00:10:58,854 --> 00:11:03,797
You can't have less parking spaces because of soil conditions, shape, or topography.

103
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:07,940
And here landscaping would require a variance as well.

104
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,462
So I can try to craft something that addresses your concern.

105
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,845
Are there others who feel similarly?

106
00:11:14,885 --> 00:11:15,545
Maybe I'm alone.

107
00:11:19,807 --> 00:11:26,748
I guess my question is how, to the attorney, how common is this language used in other communities?

108
00:11:28,168 --> 00:11:39,490
Well, the most recent governor's legislation that passed in January last year says, for the first time, that you can do this.

109
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,131
I've been doing this for 25 years.

110
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:47,592
When I did New Bedford, Compass Bank came to the city and said they wanted to put their headquarters downtown.

111
00:11:47,612 --> 00:11:48,892
But if you ran the parking numbers,

112
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:51,659
hundreds and hundreds of spaces.

113
00:11:52,419 --> 00:12:04,408
So the first time we did this was with the new Bedford ordinance where we said that you can reduce the number of required parking spaces provided that in effect, no substantial detriment shall result.

114
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:14,975
Since I've done a lot of towns and cities, this has been a condition, this has been something I've added in virtually everything for 20 years.

115
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:19,798
Not hearing any complaints back, I think,

116
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:32,267
You know, I think it's a good way of helping the business community develop in a sensitive manner, but not a rigid manner.

117
00:12:33,388 --> 00:12:47,319
Just prescribing the number of parking spaces or landscaping requirements where there's natural vegetation, for example, and they have to now plant in the middle of that seems a bit rigid.

118
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,221
So that's my intent here.

119
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,821
Questions or comments from other board members?

120
00:13:01,104 --> 00:13:01,864
Members of the public?

121
00:13:02,605 --> 00:13:12,170
And I can't see everybody right now since the screen's being shared, so you'd have to raise your hand with the function at the bottom of the Zoom screen.

122
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,697
Okay, Attorney Barresca, why don't we move on to 6.4?

123
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,468
All of 6.4 is new.

124
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:32,974
So the origins of this come from a work I did in a fairly large suburb years ago.

125
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:44,023
And as people began to build out, they realized that they had no standards for things like noise, lights.

126
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:50,468
They had no standards for how to develop a site in an orderly fashion.

127
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:56,068
They had no standards for traffic and utility connections.

128
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:57,849
So those are the main ones here.

129
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:16,320
But the idea like signs, parking, landscaping is that if the special permit granting authority or the CDB acting as site plan review authority is to make an intelligent decision, it ought to be somewhat objectified and not just left to minimize this or maximize that.

130
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,333
So there's an attempt here to create some standards in those various areas.

131
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,694
First, there's some exemptions.

132
00:14:25,074 --> 00:14:33,618
So the exemptions would include emergency response, municipal uses and structures and events.

133
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:37,199
And then it gets right into the guts of it here, lighting standards.

134
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:45,003
And the idea here is that there won't be any overspill or glare produced by a new development onto an adjacent property.

135
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:51,134
And that's a common standard that many municipalities, Watertown, for example, uses the same standard.

136
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:58,756
We're trying to keep light intensity down to a dull roar.

137
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,758
Searchlights should not be used.

138
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:12,201
Outdoor signs restricted with certain types of lighting, flickering and flashing signs shall not be permitted.

139
00:15:12,601 --> 00:15:14,782
Height of fixtures, hours of operation.

140
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:27,077
I mean, too often the parking lot is lit the same at seven when the last employee leaves as it is at one o'clock in the morning when there's really no need for the lights to be that bright.

141
00:15:27,257 --> 00:15:34,120
I'm doing a project right now in Andover where we're going light by light and seeing what we can turn off in the middle of the evening.

142
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:42,343
So those are just some, the way I put this together years ago was I did a really intensive internet search on

143
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:49,122
progressive community standards, and I picked the best, and this is what it ended up as.

144
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,885
It gets tweaked when I see something better, so it's pretty much up to speed.

145
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,249
I can take these one at a time.

146
00:15:57,569 --> 00:15:59,671
There's about six subsections here.

147
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,193
So this was lighting, noise.

148
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:12,281
Again, the state standard for noise is in that paragraph one limitation, and it is 10 dBA above ambient.

149
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,922
And that's the division of air quality standard that's in 310 CMR 7.10.

150
00:16:20,943 --> 00:16:25,925
And that's basically a doubling of the sound being produced by a facility.

151
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:33,588
And this would apply not only to new construction, but it would be a standard that would apply going forward as well.

152
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:40,591
So if there was an excess of noise above 10 dBA, then there would be enforcement possible.

153
00:16:41,386 --> 00:16:47,591
A lot of these things are just projected when you're going through the permitting process and hopefully they work out, but sometimes they don't.

154
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:56,497
Hours of operation for certain equipment is the next subject, A, B, and C. So they're pretty basic rules.

155
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:05,744
Loading, unloading, handling of boxes and crates, condition of noise pollution, pretty much banned between 6 p.m.

156
00:17:05,784 --> 00:17:06,465
and 8 a.m.

157
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:10,848
Operating tools or equipment used in construction, drilling, demo work,

158
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:14,400
6 p.m., 8 a.m., please don't do it.

159
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,862
And operation of construction devices between 8 a.m.

160
00:17:16,882 --> 00:17:17,643
and 6 p.m.

161
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:22,907
in a manner that causes noise pollution should be avoided by best available technology.

162
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,712
Maybe I should stop with light and noise, and then I'll go on to site development standards.

163
00:17:31,774 --> 00:17:32,254
Thank you.

164
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:36,838
Do board members have comments or questions about this section?

165
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:44,940
Andre, David, I have a question.

166
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,341
Yes, David, thank you.

167
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:47,521
Go ahead.

168
00:17:49,403 --> 00:18:07,034
Andre, we've been, I think, sensitive to the idea of neighborhood character, and I've been challenging myself as we've been going through this process to try to really stick to more of the exact requirements of the exact topic at issue.

169
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:11,096
So I had just a general suggestion there on 6.4.5

170
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:21,924
noise standards, and it's identifying three, I guess, goals of the noise standards.

171
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:34,910
And I thought perhaps instead of preserved neighborhood character, it could be something like guarding against increasing noise levels than existing in the neighborhood or

172
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:45,210
to avoid introducing new types of noise not then present in the neighborhood, just as an alternative way to frame it and something more specific to noise.

173
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:50,512
Don't increase my noise and don't introduce new noise, rather than preserving the character.

174
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:56,736
Right, that's something that we've been trying to flag as we go along.

175
00:18:58,276 --> 00:18:58,597
Got it.

176
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:08,182
Other board members have comments or questions?

177
00:19:18,905 --> 00:19:27,027
I actually had a question, although this is about the language before the noise and light.

178
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:27,907
It's 6.4.2.1.

179
00:19:34,766 --> 00:19:38,088
Applicants may seek a credit for development linkage fees.

180
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:38,968
Yep.

181
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:48,692
And I'm wondering if this is something that's that's common, or something the city council talked about wanted to put this in here.

182
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:59,436
Well, don't forget, you're, as far as I know, you're the only municipality in Massachusetts that has special legislation outside of Boston for linkage fees.

183
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:03,117
There are other towns, there are other towns to charge them, but they're

184
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:07,180
Their legality is quite dubious in my opinion.

185
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,062
Um, but people that if you don't complain, there's no problem with them.

186
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:18,824
So what I did with the city council was there's provision in section 10.6.1 for credits.

187
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:28,927
And it says, if you do, um, this kind of work that we're outlining in section 6.4, you ought to be able to get a credit for linkage fees.

188
00:20:29,868 --> 00:20:33,369
Um, because the linkage fees will take that into account and set the linkage fee.

189
00:20:34,031 --> 00:20:35,191
arguably at a lower rate.

190
00:20:40,013 --> 00:20:47,396
And that process, how, I guess, how subjective is it?

191
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:49,597
Well, I'm flipping back to 10.6.1.

192
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:52,718
Yeah, because I don't have that in front of me right now.

193
00:20:53,098 --> 00:20:53,378
Yeah.

194
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:58,120
So 10.6.1, what was it?

195
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,120
10.6.1.

196
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:02,502
Yeah, a credit may be given for voluntary site-related improvements or dedications

197
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:07,808
as approved or for work performed as required under section 6.4.

198
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:26,752
And then credit will be due, not due, will be due on when the development construction is completed and accepted, security is posted, or all design standards are in strict compliance with current state and city requirements.

199
00:21:27,472 --> 00:21:31,773
Credits may be provided before completion of specified improvements if assurances are given

200
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:42,330
By the applicant and security is posted, any claim for credit must be made no later than the time of the application for the building permit, not transferable from one project to another.

201
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:51,297
Determinations by the CDB or OCD may be appealed to the city council.

202
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,020
That's the credit language.

203
00:21:58,461 --> 00:22:03,647
I just want to flag that as something possibly discuss a little bit more.

204
00:22:03,667 --> 00:22:15,281
I mean, my interpretation of some of the things that would be required just for site plan review for a good project.

205
00:22:16,638 --> 00:22:21,381
are not necessarily reasons to reduce the linkage fee.

206
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:33,867
You know, the linkage fee is more for mitigation of the impact of the project, which oftentimes is not, you know, impacts beyond the site itself.

207
00:22:34,388 --> 00:22:42,512
So I just feel like maybe there could be some clarity around, you know, what kinds of

208
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,691
credit could be given for what kind of work?

209
00:22:47,791 --> 00:22:48,451
That makes sense.

210
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:56,854
When we get to the credit section, perhaps we can take a look, but it is not shall be given, it may be given for work under 6.4.

211
00:22:56,914 --> 00:23:06,257
Right, I just don't want it to become one of these things where we're arguing about it all the time.

212
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:07,737
Yeah, understood.

213
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:13,459
Shall I move on to site development standards?

214
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:16,035
Yes.

215
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:17,897
Let's go ahead, Alicia.

216
00:23:18,437 --> 00:23:19,318
I apologize.

217
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:24,622
I probably should have or somebody, I should remember this from the meetings with the city council.

218
00:23:25,222 --> 00:23:34,169
The section on the hours of operation, I have some level of confidence and I'm searching right now that we have something in our ordinances about such things.

219
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:37,731
Were those compared or checked?

220
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:42,375
I would hate to accidentally put something in conflict with Metro's ordinances.

221
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:59,603
I believe that like most communities, Medford has an outdoor construction limitation, hours are set, but this is more, for example, the A is not construction, B is construction, so it would need to be consistent.

222
00:24:01,564 --> 00:24:05,206
And C would be outside the normal hours.

223
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:11,609
Normally municipalities say that

224
00:24:12,455 --> 00:24:16,417
Exterior construction is allowed between, I'm picking a number, 7 a.m.

225
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:17,558
or 7.30 a.m.

226
00:24:17,778 --> 00:24:21,100
on a weekday, and must conclude by 6 o'clock p.m.

227
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:25,663
And on Saturdays, there are usually shorter hours, and on Sunday, it's usually prohibited.

228
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:28,965
But it doesn't apply to interior construction.

229
00:24:29,065 --> 00:24:30,946
Usually, it's just exterior construction.

230
00:24:32,808 --> 00:24:41,393
Attorney Bobrowski, why don't you go through all of the performance standards, and that way we don't have to stop after each section, because I know we don't have too much time.

231
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:53,337
All right, site development standards go to questions like, should I be able to strip my property of all vegetation and then market it and hope that somebody buys it before the sediment clogs the nearest storm drain?

232
00:24:53,477 --> 00:25:04,761
So here you have a land disturbance requirements, replication, clearing for utility trenching limitations, site design.

233
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:08,203
So this is just an attempt to give some rough standards for

234
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:13,358
For example, look at B, building shall be directed away from the crest of the hills.

235
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:32,288
Archaeological historical resources, preservation of existing vegetation, re-vegetation, limits of clearing, finished grade, topsoil for re-vegetation, irrigation.

236
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:36,970
I don't know if onsite wells are appropriate in Medford, but you can tell me.

237
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:39,869
the development may be phased.

238
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:49,635
So these are just some things to think about in terms of setting up the very first steps, mostly before the issuance of the building permit.

239
00:25:52,857 --> 00:25:59,822
What we would call pre-construction activities, grubbing and clearing, removal of vegetation.

240
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:03,965
The next one is

241
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:11,129
a brazen attempt to set some pedestrian access vehicular standards, traffic management standards.

242
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:24,491
So what we're thinking about here is access and the way that curb cuts should be faced for new construction, driveways, standards for driveways.

243
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:33,173
You can see some linear measurements for curb cut suggested at 20 feet for residential, 30 feet for a commercial property.

244
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,283
Just a basic statement that interior circulation shall be safe.

245
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:40,904
Transportation plan approval.

246
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:52,632
This in the instance where the development proposed is greater than 25,000 gross square feet, a full TIAS would be required.

247
00:26:52,672 --> 00:26:56,215
That's the traffic engineers currency.

248
00:26:56,315 --> 00:27:01,218
They do that in conjunction with mass DOT standards or ITE standards.

249
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:02,459
They're both pretty much the same.

250
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:06,235
And that's a full-blown traffic study.

251
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:30,083
It goes all the way through trip generation, trip distribution, crash data, site distance, and then volume, existing volume, and then loading the new traffic in with a seven-year build-out provided, and then finally level of service at intersections that are deemed appropriate by the traffic engineer and the peer reviewer, if you're using a peer reviewer.

252
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:31,344
And then,

253
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:39,065
If it's a 25,000 square foot project, it also needs a TMC.

254
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:55,692
This is going to use alternative measures to reduce the number of vehicles such as employee carpools, rail passes, monetary incentives, onsite shower facilities to allow biking to work for employees.

255
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,695
Reduction in parking is something we've already covered in 6.1.

256
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:05,359
and level of service maintenance or improvement.

257
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:11,262
If you've got somebody coming in and they're going to take what is, you know, we're in Eastern Massachusetts.

258
00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:26,410
So let's be honest, everything is D or worse, but if you're going to take it down below D, then you've got to provide some sort of information about what the cost estimate would be to restore that level of service.

259
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,592
And the same would apply in B.

260
00:28:32,124 --> 00:28:39,146
Dangerous intersections would be identified, site distance would be identified, maximum parking.

261
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:46,628
This allows for maximum parking to be no more than 200% of the minimum number of spaces.

262
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:50,410
Some communities say that the minimum and the maximum shall be the same.

263
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,031
And then mitigation, which is the only way to fix this stuff.

264
00:28:55,131 --> 00:29:01,293
Obviously you don't have jurisdiction over a state numbered highway, but you do have jurisdiction over the city's roads.

265
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:13,165
So such improvements could include widening the intersection, assuming it's available about extensive takings and or traffic signals if it meets the warrants.

266
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:21,709
And then the last section is on pedestrian and bicycle safety and traffic calming features kind of winds that up.

267
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:30,373
I'm doing a project right now in a town where for various reasons, it's not really possible to

268
00:29:31,592 --> 00:29:37,517
dictate how much traffic will head right or left up this road, but you can certainly make that happen.

269
00:29:37,577 --> 00:29:52,611
My traffic engineer tells me by putting in crosswalks, bike lanes, rumble strips, landscape islands, because trucks will, while not required to go in a specific direction, will choose the other direction if you put those kinds of things in the street.

270
00:29:52,731 --> 00:29:57,175
And he also tells me that there's a new kind of speed hump

271
00:29:57,998 --> 00:30:03,401
that allows a fire truck to pass without impairment, but a regular truck is pretty much stuck in the mud.

272
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:05,322
So they typically don't like those roads.

273
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:08,944
Aesthetic standards, I didn't go too deep here.

274
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:12,425
We're just trying to suggest that you shouldn't build something completely ugly.

275
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:17,308
So harmony and scale, consistency with goals of the master plan, if any.

276
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:21,650
Same thing for utility security and emergency system standards.

277
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,471
We just want the pipes to be

278
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:50,054
able to carry the load, so sufficient water capacity, sufficient sewage capacity, site security, so that the police chief has an idea of what's going on in the building and how he should respond in the event of an emergency, underground to the extent it's permissible, and a fire alarm system, perhaps directly wired in if the fire chief thinks that that's appropriate.

279
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:54,859
Fiscal analysis is mostly for informational purposes.

280
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,184
Proposed developments have a positive or a negative net fiscal position for the municipality.

281
00:31:01,264 --> 00:31:03,445
I think it's valuable information for you to know.

282
00:31:04,886 --> 00:31:11,331
It may not be a determinant in how you make your special permit decision, but at the same time, it does assist you in the realm of planning.

283
00:31:11,931 --> 00:31:21,638
So in the end, it's oftentimes very interesting to see what the promises versus the reality of net

284
00:31:22,565 --> 00:31:23,526
net cost benefit.

285
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:29,411
And then 6.411 is the old MUZ standards here.

286
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:38,438
So I don't know that these are terribly valuable and they seem a generation old at this point, but they're not certainly nothing wrong with them.

287
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:48,066
Don't vibrate, no radioactivity, odor should be limited, toxic noxious matter should be limited, dust and fly ash limited, smoke limited.

288
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,208
You can actually, in some of these cases now,

289
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:51,799
create a number.

290
00:31:52,019 --> 00:32:01,542
For example, years ago, I learned about the Ringelmann smoke chart in which smoke is graded from clear to black.

291
00:32:02,002 --> 00:32:07,864
And you can say, we don't want anything on the chart greater than number 12 or something to that effect.

292
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:10,485
And there's your waiver of standards provision again.

293
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:17,207
So that's a parallel to the parking signage landscaping provisions that we talked about.

294
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:28,036
So when I do this in a municipality, first of all, I hope it's red because there's a lot in there.

295
00:32:28,056 --> 00:32:34,922
I urge my client city or town to treat it as a sushi menu and order what you think is appropriate.

296
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:42,368
I would never propose those standards that you have just looked at in Berkeley, you know, population 4,000, too much.

297
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:49,254
So we try to tailor it to fit the municipality's needs.

298
00:32:52,499 --> 00:32:54,440
All right, thank you, Attorney Hrabowski.

299
00:32:55,942 --> 00:32:59,324
Let me open the conversation to board members.

300
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:08,131
Again, since I can't see you, you may have to just unmic yourself and jump in, but introduce yourself, please.

301
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:13,615
Andre, this is David.

302
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:15,076
Yes, David, go ahead.

303
00:33:17,272 --> 00:33:18,833
Thanks, Attorney Poprosky.

304
00:33:18,853 --> 00:33:43,182
I thought the waiver of standards here actually was a little bit more like what I had in mind, which is it seems like you would be waiving some standards if you found some extra benefit or if it's consistent with the goals of the section, that sort of stuff I think would be, maybe that's along the lines of what I had in mind with my earlier comment.

305
00:33:43,687 --> 00:33:50,791
So do you think that 6412 is adequate to just adapt for the parking ending and the signage ending and the landscaping ending.

306
00:33:51,072 --> 00:33:59,657
That would, that would be my suggestion, because at least it keeps the board focused and exercising that discretion on the benefits of this particular section.

307
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:03,559
Um, and how they're that's might benefit the community overall.

308
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,120
Yeah.

309
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:09,543
The thinking here is that if it needs a special permit, since it's already at

310
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:21,928
a city council or perhaps a ZBA hearing that that special permit granting authority should also control waivers, whether it's parking signs, landscaping or performance standards.

311
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:28,031
And that's another benefit for the business community and that they don't have to rush back and forth between two boards to do it.

312
00:34:28,772 --> 00:34:36,696
The CDB would administer these special permits only where the use is allowed as of right, but subject to site plan approval.

313
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:45,655
Of course the CDB could make recommendations to the special permit granting authority about the grant or denial of a waiver, but that would ultimately be the SPGA decision.

314
00:34:49,479 --> 00:35:00,530
Okay, and I just had one one other item and I can't recall exactly when we discussed this but I know as a board we discussed something similar to 6.4 point 10 the fiscal analysis.

315
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:08,646
And at the time we felt that at least that was, this is my recall and the board members can correct me if I'm wrong.

316
00:35:09,467 --> 00:35:14,193
But I think the sense was, well that might be helpful information in some instances.

317
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:32,733
It is an extra burden on the developer to come up with it number one and number two, there are probably a lot of proposed developments that won't lend themselves necessarily to more of a number crunching exercise, and the numbers alone may not reflect the true and full benefit to the community.

318
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:44,541
So I think we just had we were skeptical as to whether this was something of value to the city, but maybe my fellow board members can remind me where we left off there.

319
00:35:49,452 --> 00:35:51,834
That was the, are you talking about the fiscal analysis, David?

320
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:53,996
I am exactly.

321
00:35:54,036 --> 00:36:04,124
I think we, I think we were inclined not to, to have that kind of a standard in at least our submissions to our board.

322
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:06,746
Right.

323
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:07,787
Yeah.

324
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:13,452
One of the, one of the special permit granting criteria, if you look

325
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:17,962
I'm gonna look for it right now, but I do it all the time.

326
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:40,549
So I know that the final criterion in section 11.6, I believe, is potential fiscal impact, including impact on city services, tax base and employment, taking into account any proposed mitigation.

327
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:43,890
So that would be the sixth of the six criteria

328
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,057
for special permit.

329
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:50,861
And I would never advise a municipality to deny it because you didn't make enough money.

330
00:36:51,802 --> 00:36:53,143
But I do think it's important.

331
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:57,486
This all stems from work Judy Barrett and I have done over 25 years.

332
00:36:58,027 --> 00:37:07,975
You hear developers puff the contributions that will be made to the community and then you do the cost benefit analysis or more appropriately, Judy does it.

333
00:37:08,556 --> 00:37:10,757
And it turns out that $180,000 a year is really more like 70 because

334
00:37:14,307 --> 00:37:15,967
it's gonna need three extra policemen.

335
00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:24,289
Yeah, can you talk a little bit more about how something like this would be implemented?

336
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:29,890
Would this require a third party, you know, consultant to do the work?

337
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:30,550
Yes.

338
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:37,472
And the way that it's written, it looks like it's required of every project and we don't get, we get a lot of smaller projects before our board.

339
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:39,292
Well, there's a waiver for you then.

340
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:43,153
So it wouldn't necessarily be done every time,

341
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:46,481
have you worked with Judy Barrett?

342
00:37:48,122 --> 00:37:51,943
I know her, I haven't worked on the project.

343
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:55,525
She's the oldest practitioner of this art.

344
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:59,787
John, oh God, I've forgotten his last name.

345
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:03,369
They used to have Battle Royals, it was entertaining.

346
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:04,889
She's now retired.

347
00:38:05,189 --> 00:38:07,971
He was more on the development side, Judy's more on the municipal side.

348
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:13,193
But it generally would be engagement of a third party

349
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:18,079
of financial analysts, RKG does this up in New Hampshire.

350
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,381
There's another gentleman up in New Hampshire named Mark Fugere who does this.

351
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:29,485
And then you would have your own peer reviewer to take a look at this to see whether or not it's panning out as you thought.

352
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:40,611
Right, well, there's nothing that prevents us from requiring a developer to pay for

353
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:46,213
a consultant to do the studies that are needed, right?

354
00:38:46,353 --> 00:38:47,513
Even without this language.

355
00:38:48,614 --> 00:38:55,477
Well, you know, the developer, if they're proud of their contribution, may offer to do this because it's a selling point for the permit process.

356
00:38:56,117 --> 00:39:06,782
When we did an analysis of a senior housing facility up on the North shore, I think it came back something like of every tax dollar collected

357
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:13,638
24, 25 cents would go to the costs of the municipality and the other 75 cents was free cash.

358
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:15,859
So that's an important thing to know.

359
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,521
It should not be the determinant.

360
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,461
I wanna make that very clear.

361
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:28,444
You should never deny something solely on the basis of the fact that it's revenue neutral or it's revenue negative.

362
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:34,186
Right, well, and I think that if we were to keep something in here,

363
00:39:36,714 --> 00:39:58,520
we seems like we would like to shift the language so because the way it's written right now it does sound proposed development shall maintain a positive net fiscal position for the long term does seem like it's something that could be a basis of a denial well i would also then be thinking about this in terms of that last special permit criterion and maybe

364
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,850
following suit there.

365
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:09,372
So if this is going to go away or get modified somehow, I think we probably would need to modify that sixth criteria as well.

366
00:40:10,472 --> 00:40:11,072
Criterion.

367
00:40:13,753 --> 00:40:16,913
What do you think of the MUZ standards?

368
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,814
Can they go or do you want them to stay?

369
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,274
I mean, they certainly don't do any harm.

370
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:24,315
I don't have a strong opinion about it myself.

371
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:25,555
I don't know if other board members do.

372
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,962
I don't hear a strong, anything.

373
00:40:36,324 --> 00:40:39,066
You got a certain Smithsonian character to them, don't they?

374
00:40:39,826 --> 00:40:42,508
How are they different from the ones that we just went through?

375
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:52,574
Well, vibration, I mean, these, you know, you don't, there are no standards for odor.

376
00:40:52,594 --> 00:40:58,858
I mean, I guess that's why I left them in, but I, and I broadened them, note the strikeout,

377
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:15,524
The old version said just in the MUZ, my draft says that all uses of land, regardless of whether it's in an MUZ that requires a special permit or a site plan approval shall comply with these standards.

378
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:19,785
So it's going from MUZ to citywide for special permit projects.

379
00:41:22,306 --> 00:41:23,106
Yeah.

380
00:41:23,186 --> 00:41:26,727
I mean, I think it doesn't hurt to keep them.

381
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:27,567
Okay.

382
00:41:32,384 --> 00:41:36,887
All right, are there members of the public who would like to speak about the performance standards?

383
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:45,674
Let me just stop the screen sharing.

384
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:52,680
All right, Mr. Navarro.

385
00:41:55,142 --> 00:41:56,683
And again, name and address for the record.

386
00:41:57,632 --> 00:42:00,975
William DeVar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

387
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:05,659
I just wanted to sort of echo some of the concerns that member Lumberg had.

388
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:13,626
I think that especially when I'm thinking about like, I think this applies to small apartment buildings, site plan review.

389
00:42:14,426 --> 00:42:21,833
And people sometimes pontificate on the fiscal impacts of an apartment going up.

390
00:42:21,933 --> 00:42:24,475
And while it might be interesting to have some data,

391
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:34,394
David Ensign, PB – He, Him, His): Rather us not put an extra burden on every multi family housing project of hiring a consultant to know that because we are in a housing crisis.

392
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:35,995
David Ensign, PB – He, Him, His.:

393
00:42:35,995 --> 00:42:42,179
: And maybe that maybe, maybe, maybe the city could do its own analysis on something like that.

394
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:48,123
It feels like it shouldn't be that hard, but just the idea of having every housing project right

395
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:58,876
But just having every developer do that, and you can avoid doing that by not building housing or building only a duplex, where maybe a triplex or something is appropriate given our housing crisis.

396
00:42:59,596 --> 00:43:02,197
I think that we should be concerned about that.

397
00:43:02,837 --> 00:43:11,001
Obviously, if somebody is building a massive paper mill or something, and it's going to make a mess, it's OK though, because it's good for the fiscal.

398
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:13,061
I could see the point of this.

399
00:43:13,121 --> 00:43:17,103
But if somebody is doing a six-unit apartment building,

400
00:43:17,865 --> 00:43:18,926
I don't see that quite as much.

401
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:24,570
All right, thank you.

402
00:43:26,211 --> 00:43:28,813
Other members of the public who would like to speak?

403
00:43:31,134 --> 00:43:46,865
And again, just, we're not, I think what we're trying to do here to get through the whole, all of Attorney Bobrowski's presentation is to mostly ask clarifying questions or raise flags for further conversation, but we want to take advantage of his time.

404
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,101
Thank you, Attorney Baruski, why don't we move on?

405
00:43:51,101 --> 00:44:04,127
Okay, the next section talks about adult entertainment, adult uses, and I've made some changes, but they are necessary for constitutional reasons.

406
00:44:04,947 --> 00:44:17,272
So adult use, adult entertainment is protected speech under the First Amendment, and to target it directly by saying the adult use shall or the adult speech shall is

407
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,091
it is going right after the First Amendment right.

408
00:44:23,631 --> 00:44:25,792
And you would need to show a compelling reason to do that.

409
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:31,475
The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled in a parcel of cases that this is protected speech.

410
00:44:31,975 --> 00:44:40,019
So accordingly, the typical regulation says that the purpose of the regulation is to address secondary effects.

411
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:46,942
Secondary effects, including increased crime, adverse impacts on health, business climate, property values,

412
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:49,273
and quality of life in the city.

413
00:44:49,814 --> 00:44:58,321
Those secondary targets are subject to reasonable time, place and manner restrictions under the First Amendment's jurisprudence.

414
00:44:58,761 --> 00:45:00,282
So this is boilerplate.

415
00:45:00,362 --> 00:45:13,333
This is where the law begins and you have to be sure to do this or else it's a civil rights violation if you go too quickly after the speech itself rather than the secondary effects.

416
00:45:14,448 --> 00:45:21,291
And I know from my work in other communities that you've had some experience with adult entertainment facilities.

417
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:24,872
So I've added this for your protection and that's it.

418
00:45:25,793 --> 00:45:35,116
Having said that, the other language in the section is what I could salvage from the existing small provisions that you had.

419
00:45:35,717 --> 00:45:39,798
So adult entertainment establishments have been grouped together.

420
00:45:40,198 --> 00:45:43,740
It's now a word that means bookstores, adult motion picture theaters,

421
00:45:44,638 --> 00:45:50,522
adult video stores, adult cabaret, they're all adult entertainment establishments in the definition section.

422
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:56,446
And they're not closer than 750 feet from each other, a public or private nursery school.

423
00:45:56,946 --> 00:46:10,275
I modernize daycare centers to include family daycare homes, childcare centers, school-age childcare programs, public or private kindergarten, school, schools and schools, playgrounds, churches, residential properties.

424
00:46:10,355 --> 00:46:13,497
And then the actual enabling act

425
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:27,263
requires that you eliminate from consideration anybody convicted of or violating these statutes, chapter 119, section 63, or chapter 272, section 28.

426
00:46:28,503 --> 00:46:33,226
And you don't want these things visible from a window onto the street.

427
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:35,007
That's another typical condition.

428
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:42,712
So it looks like it's a lot of rewrite, but it's pretty much what you had before with some constitutionality added.

429
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:54,227
Section 7.2, section seven is special regulations that apply to just a particular kind of business or a kind of activity.

430
00:46:54,648 --> 00:47:04,256
It's not general in applicability because it's not parking that applies to multiple purposes or signs or landscaping or performance standards.

431
00:47:04,316 --> 00:47:11,922
These are just special regulations for section 7.2 retailer wholesale store factory manufacturing plant.

432
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:12,703
My guess is that

433
00:47:13,296 --> 00:47:14,757
These were added a long time ago.

434
00:47:15,078 --> 00:47:16,779
They continue to be in your old ordinance.

435
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,021
They're not doing any harm.

436
00:47:18,581 --> 00:47:19,242
So they're in here.

437
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,286
Uh, limitations on genetic biomed and chemical research.

438
00:47:23,346 --> 00:47:24,847
Again, not a word change.

439
00:47:24,987 --> 00:47:28,751
This is, um, what you have now.

440
00:47:29,071 --> 00:47:33,175
It does prohibit, uh, bio level four, uh, in the city.

441
00:47:34,497 --> 00:47:37,820
Solar, um, is a very interesting solar bylaw.

442
00:47:38,409 --> 00:47:39,009
or ordinance.

443
00:47:39,549 --> 00:47:42,090
Normally I see solar energy systems regulated.

444
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:45,172
A solar energy system is the term in the statute.

445
00:47:46,552 --> 00:47:51,214
So good to call it that because you then get the benefits of the statutory protection.

446
00:47:51,734 --> 00:47:57,936
Solar energy systems are in flux right now if you are to over-regulate.

447
00:47:58,097 --> 00:48:04,479
Many smaller communities, rural communities, suburban communities say you can only have large scale ground-mounted

448
00:48:05,555 --> 00:48:09,557
photovoltaic facilities in a certain district and then by special permit.

449
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:13,258
That's now been litigated at the land court and now the appeals court.

450
00:48:13,738 --> 00:48:25,022
Judge Piper, chief judge of the land court, has ruled that the protection for solar energy systems is the same as the Dover protection for a church, school, or a child care facility.

451
00:48:25,323 --> 00:48:26,723
That's now working its way up.

452
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:29,904
That's a massive change out where I live.

453
00:48:30,845 --> 00:48:31,665
Here, you're really

454
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:38,801
Taking the opposite tack, you're saying we want solar energy systems if your building contains 10 or more units.

455
00:48:39,141 --> 00:48:43,522
We want if it's new construction of 10,000 square feet or more of floor area.

456
00:48:43,582 --> 00:48:51,944
So I congratulate you for this approach that encourages, if not requires, solar energy in certain situations.

457
00:48:52,144 --> 00:48:56,805
And I've taken what I believe was a general ordinance and moved it over here into zoning.

458
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:03,508
vacant and foreclosing property section 7.5 is what you have now.

459
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:09,754
Excuse me, we have Director Schrader from the city who raised his hand.

460
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:12,056
Thank you, Chair.

461
00:49:13,337 --> 00:49:24,827
Mark in section 7.3 limitations on genetic biomedical and chemical research we added biosafety level three to that our current ordinance restricts level four.

462
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:28,627
And we discussed adding three with city council.

463
00:49:28,687 --> 00:49:29,927
I just want to make note of that.

464
00:49:31,267 --> 00:49:38,549
I'm looking at a color coded version that predates the one that you have on your screen.

465
00:49:38,629 --> 00:49:45,311
So I'm just going to take a second to look to see in the draft nine, whether that's changed.

466
00:49:45,531 --> 00:49:46,511
Change has been made.

467
00:49:47,211 --> 00:49:47,992
Take me a second.

468
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,032
I believe it has.

469
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:53,153
It was just wanted to make sure it has been made.

470
00:49:53,193 --> 00:49:53,613
Yeah, I see it.

471
00:49:56,287 --> 00:49:56,567
Okay.

472
00:49:56,607 --> 00:49:56,927
Thank you.

473
00:49:59,328 --> 00:50:02,429
So vacant foreclosing properties is unique.

474
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:08,791
I've never seen this before in anybody's anybody else's ordinances, but I, you know, it's, it's in there.

475
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:10,612
It seems to have a valuable purpose.

476
00:50:10,672 --> 00:50:13,233
And so I've just renumbered it and placed it here.

477
00:50:16,154 --> 00:50:24,477
And at the end of this section, adult use marijuana establishments, this would be your contribution to

478
00:50:25,303 --> 00:50:26,563
recreational marijuana.

479
00:50:29,784 --> 00:50:32,624
And I believe I just renumbered what you have.

480
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:47,167
Yeah, and that's was recently addressed by the city council so this is all something that we're not revisiting here, really just.

481
00:50:47,987 --> 00:50:51,888
It's a very long section but we can we can just go through that scroll through it.

482
00:50:51,988 --> 00:50:53,108
I mean, yeah.

483
00:50:55,996 --> 00:51:03,759
And then finally, it never ends.

484
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:07,881
Wireless telecommunications.

485
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:09,162
So this is new.

486
00:51:09,182 --> 00:51:17,425
I saw nothing in the existing ordinance that talked about wireless.

487
00:51:18,186 --> 00:51:21,087
So I worked with Paul Moki and

488
00:51:22,127 --> 00:51:33,616
City Council to come up with something that we thought would manage effectively what the rules should be for wireless antenna and monopoles if needed.

489
00:51:35,117 --> 00:51:49,288
There was some question about whether or not the next generation of wireless, which I believe is mounted more on telephone poles, should be covered by these regulations.

490
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:57,185
Telephone poles are generally in the public way and they are not subject to zoning regulation.

491
00:51:57,785 --> 00:52:13,071
So this looks more at the regulations for the ability of the provision of cell service from five years ago rather than the provision five years from now.

492
00:52:16,332 --> 00:52:17,612
But you didn't have anything before, so.

493
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,022
And is there anything that we need to know about that?

494
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:26,364
And Amanda, can you just scroll through a little bit?

495
00:52:29,406 --> 00:52:44,717
Yeah, so what I tried to do was create a system here by which any construction of new wireless telecommunication facilities would be avoided where there's no proof in advance that it's actually needed.

496
00:52:45,318 --> 00:52:51,102
As you may know, the facilities have coverage areas that can be determined by

497
00:52:52,151 --> 00:52:55,974
a technician and gaps in coverage are prohibited.

498
00:52:56,034 --> 00:53:01,538
So the Wireless Telecommunications Act says that you cannot discriminate between carriers.

499
00:53:01,758 --> 00:53:03,659
You cannot prohibit facilities.

500
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:11,665
And by that, the law has been interpreted to mean that a gap in coverage is a prohibition, which is not allowed.

501
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:18,930
So you have to kind of space the area in which these things can go so that you kill the gaps.

502
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:21,272
And if you have a gap even then,

503
00:53:22,088 --> 00:53:31,472
and someone wants to locate outside an area that's been approved, there's a Massachusetts appeals court case that says it's eligible for a variance.

504
00:53:31,552 --> 00:53:36,394
And instead of applying the usual variance standards, you adapt the variance standards to the wireless standards.

505
00:53:37,415 --> 00:53:41,016
Wireless denials have to be based on substantial evidence.

506
00:53:41,056 --> 00:53:42,597
So that ratchets up the usual.

507
00:53:43,377 --> 00:53:48,560
I'm sorry, Amanda, can you just stop on the criteria there so that people can read that on the screen?

508
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,320
Thank you.

509
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:53,219
Let me come back and see where she stopped.

510
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,300
Okay, so yeah.

511
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:18,349
So the applicant's not already providing adequate coverage, not able to use an existing facility, minimize adverse impacts, agreed to implement reasonable measures to mitigate possible adverse impacts, FCC regs, and they've agreed to rent without discrimination to other.

512
00:54:18,369 --> 00:54:20,950
That parallels the words of the statute there.

513
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:27,851
So you would have as a first option here that this could go in a church steeple or it could go on a roof.

514
00:54:28,131 --> 00:54:38,657
But if it's talking about putting up a new monopole, you really have to go through the grind here in order to show that that should be your last choice.

515
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:49,783
And as you just mentioned, Attorney Bobrowsky, so this doesn't cover things like,

516
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:55,462
you know, on a commercial building or a steeple.

517
00:54:56,983 --> 00:55:04,867
No, it, it, it does allow for concealed antennas and, um, building mounted as well.

518
00:55:11,231 --> 00:55:16,614
So you can see the preference here, location seven, seven, four, their priorities established.

519
00:55:18,037 --> 00:55:24,401
Applicants shall demonstrate they've investigated the higher priority rankings than the one in which they're applying and why they can't do that.

520
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:27,783
First priority within an existing structure concealed.

521
00:55:28,704 --> 00:55:31,346
Second priority on industrial or commercially zoned land.

522
00:55:31,426 --> 00:55:34,768
Third within an existing structure, camouflage not concealed.

523
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:38,771
Then it goes, it ranks these further down to number seven.

524
00:55:39,571 --> 00:55:45,535
So the only time you get to building a new facility, and it can only be a monopole a hundred feet high,

525
00:55:46,097 --> 00:55:48,299
would be we can't do one through six.

526
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,381
Okay, thank you.

527
00:55:54,925 --> 00:55:56,706
And I borrowed a little from Lexington.

528
00:55:56,746 --> 00:56:00,770
I borrowed a little from Quincy, I think, and we came up with a hybrid.

529
00:56:07,716 --> 00:56:09,617
Is that the end of section seven?

530
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:10,618
Yes.

531
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,500
Okay.

532
00:56:13,597 --> 00:56:17,959
Any board members have comments or questions about section seven?

533
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:26,201
Again, feel free to speak up since we're sharing the screen.

534
00:56:26,222 --> 00:56:35,345
I think it seems pretty straightforward.

535
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:35,825
Okay.

536
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:42,027
Any members of the public want to speak on section seven before moving on?

537
00:56:47,552 --> 00:56:51,013
All right, I don't see anybody, so let's move on to section eight.

538
00:56:51,693 --> 00:56:58,415
Okay, again, now we're in an area of the bylaw, the ordinance rather, that has just been moved over and renumbered.

539
00:56:58,535 --> 00:57:01,316
So inclusionary zoning has just been renumbered.

540
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:09,258
In fact, I gave your inclusionary zoning provision to the city of Haverhill, which has established a task force for downtown affordable housing.

541
00:57:09,498 --> 00:57:11,218
I'm the legal advisor to it.

542
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:17,160
I gave them yours, Quincy's, Brookline's, and Newton's.

543
00:57:19,438 --> 00:57:39,785
So this is just remembered and scrolling through accessory dwelling units we did spend a considerable amount of time on this at the council at us were a target of governor.

544
00:57:40,765 --> 00:57:47,047
And what the governor said in the legislation, and now law is that an ad you.

545
00:57:48,148 --> 00:57:49,729
has a certain definition to it.

546
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:52,030
I think that's worth reviewing the definition.

547
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,571
So I'll just jump down to the definition in my version here.

548
00:57:56,892 --> 00:58:13,939
So an ADU is a self-contained housing unit inclusive of sleeping, cooking and sanitary facilities on the same lot as the principal dwelling as defined in chapter 40A, section 1A.

549
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:16,360
I believe that the size limitation

550
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:24,218
of an ADU is not more than, I don't remember that.

551
00:58:24,238 --> 00:58:34,060
I've got to look at that definition, but it's not more than half the size of the principal structure or I believe 800 square feet, whichever is smaller.

552
00:58:34,441 --> 00:58:38,101
So that might not be the exact number, but there is a definition.

553
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:39,622
So this section- 900.

554
00:58:40,182 --> 00:58:40,362
Is it 900?

555
00:58:40,482 --> 00:58:40,862
I think so.

556
00:58:41,442 --> 00:58:41,682
Yeah.

557
00:58:41,782 --> 00:58:42,902
I have to check.

558
00:58:44,363 --> 00:58:46,283
So this is incorporating the governor's

559
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:47,322
standard.

560
00:58:47,562 --> 00:58:52,385
And the governor says you can allow them by right in the principal dwelling.

561
00:58:52,825 --> 00:58:57,567
And you can also allow them in an accessory structure on the same lot as the principal dwelling.

562
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:02,469
And the city council made the choice back in section eight point.

563
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:08,632
I'm just scrolling back up in my on screen here.

564
00:59:20,831 --> 00:59:28,197
So the city council made the choice to allow them by right in the principal unit and by special permit in an accessory unit.

565
00:59:29,718 --> 00:59:39,626
And this has repercussions for your voting because under the governor's act, some of this now only requires a 50% vote of the council instead of the two thirds.

566
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:46,992
And some of it only requires the same change for the actual special permit.

567
00:59:50,574 --> 00:59:57,456
So ADU is allowed as of right in the principal dwelling or by special permit in an existing detached structure.

568
00:59:57,956 --> 01:00:00,697
Both of those are consistent with the governor's language.

569
01:00:01,578 --> 01:00:05,719
And then the requirements are pretty much a hybrid of new and old.

570
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:08,360
This is what you had before in large measure.

571
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,201
No, 900 square feet, I see it there.

572
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:13,042
That's the definition in the statute.

573
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:19,964
Right, so just again to clarify for folks,

574
01:00:21,027 --> 01:00:31,252
If there's an accessory dwelling unit, which is kind of an accessory apartment, oftentimes they're called in-law units.

575
01:00:32,553 --> 01:00:37,455
They can be used for a caretaker or a family member.

576
01:00:37,475 --> 01:00:42,818
So you can have multi-generational family living together or nearby.

577
01:00:44,759 --> 01:00:49,461
That, as long as it's inside the existing single family home,

578
01:00:50,155 --> 01:00:58,782
and it doesn't change the outside of the home that people are allowed to do that as of right.

579
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:11,132
You don't need a special permit, but if you're going to propose putting one of these accessory apartments in your backyard, for example, then you need to get a special permit.

580
01:01:13,214 --> 01:01:18,458
Yeah, and I believe the key language there would be in a detached structure

581
01:01:21,806 --> 01:01:23,868
in an existing detached structure.

582
01:01:23,968 --> 01:01:31,113
So it's got, it's targeting things like a garage with a second floor or a carriage house or something to that effect.

583
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:39,259
It doesn't, this is not something that is specifically, I'm sure there may be a question on this, so I'm addressing it in advance.

584
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:48,225
This is not something that would be, that was designed to accommodate a tiny house as a second dwelling unit on a lot.

585
01:01:49,477 --> 01:01:54,719
Mr. Chair, if I might ask specifically on that point, Attorney Brabowski, this is Alicia.

586
01:01:56,520 --> 01:02:02,163
Would that, does that absence of that imply that they are not permitted?

587
01:02:02,363 --> 01:02:13,568
There is no route to create a new accessory detached structure to then add a accessory dwelling unit?

588
01:02:14,088 --> 01:02:14,388
Correct.

589
01:02:18,187 --> 01:02:25,414
And I've been reading about what they're doing in California to promote affordable housing in a state that doesn't have any.

590
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:35,363
And it seems like their idea would be to allow for a tiny home as a second dwelling unit on a lot, I'm sure that meets certain characteristics.

591
01:02:35,443 --> 01:02:42,410
But the only place I know in Massachusetts that does that as a cultural thing is Nantucket.

592
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:49,811
There have been a number of communities that have moved in this direction.

593
01:02:49,911 --> 01:02:56,312
So that's something that I'm certainly interested in looking into a little bit more.

594
01:02:56,332 --> 01:03:01,833
I know the city of Newton, I believe they also, they allow detached ones by special permit now.

595
01:03:02,353 --> 01:03:03,333
I can look into that more.

596
01:03:03,753 --> 01:03:06,253
But is that new construction or existing structures?

597
01:03:06,273 --> 01:03:07,614
I believe it's new.

598
01:03:07,634 --> 01:03:09,874
Okay, well, it wouldn't surprise me.

599
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,055
I know Arlington passed

600
01:03:15,933 --> 01:03:23,015
ADU ordinance recently, but I haven't checked to see whether the new detached units are allowed or not.

601
01:03:23,035 --> 01:03:29,917
I thought they were.

602
01:03:30,658 --> 01:03:31,318
I'm sorry, what's that?

603
01:03:31,378 --> 01:03:32,198
That was Arlington.

604
01:03:32,218 --> 01:03:36,680
I think Arlington and Newton might be worth looking at.

605
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,961
Yeah, I've been asked this question quite often recently.

606
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,840
So just, yeah, just want to flag that.

607
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,861
I think this is great that the city council wants to move in this direction.

608
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:55,423
And I think maybe we just want to, we could consider making a recommendation about expanding it a little bit.

609
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:58,903
Obviously they're going to make the choice whether to do that or not, but.

610
01:04:01,864 --> 01:04:02,824
Okay.

611
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:04,464
Senior housing is new.

612
01:04:05,105 --> 01:04:07,025
This section only has a couple of sections left.

613
01:04:07,065 --> 01:04:08,505
So, yeah.

614
01:04:09,085 --> 01:04:10,326
So this would be a,

615
01:04:12,836 --> 01:04:15,678
blanket provision that allows senior housing facilities.

616
01:04:16,058 --> 01:04:27,427
They would be defined in 832 when you look back at the definitions as independent living, assisted living, including memory unit, long-term care facility or congregate care facility.

617
01:04:27,487 --> 01:04:34,692
Congregate care would be one or more of the other three components together in a single facility.

618
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:41,497
So the idea here is that your baby boomers are all going to

619
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,672
find themselves needing some sort of an end place.

620
01:04:46,293 --> 01:04:50,556
And these, you know, very typically are a choice that benefits people.

621
01:04:52,698 --> 01:04:58,282
All allowed by special permit from the CDB just in 833.

622
01:04:59,543 --> 01:05:11,292
So there's a flexible approach here in that we are not recommending any kind of density ratio by per square foot of lot size, for example.

623
01:05:11,733 --> 01:05:16,977
It's more or less bring me something to look at and we'll see if we like it.

624
01:05:17,577 --> 01:05:22,061
And if we don't, and if it's five pounds of sugar in a two pound bag, we'll say no.

625
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:30,787
But the height limitations, 35 feet, unless a building is being renovated, 20 foot setbacks.

626
01:05:31,848 --> 01:05:38,193
You want it to be a little bit further away from existing residential dwellings because it's a different character.

627
01:05:38,233 --> 01:05:40,955
I just litigated one of these up in Andover.

628
01:05:41,895 --> 01:05:50,162
100 beds, it's probably about, oh, it's probably, it's certainly well over 50,000 square feet in size.

629
01:05:51,703 --> 01:05:53,024
And it's in a residential district.

630
01:05:53,044 --> 01:05:55,506
So you'd wanna be sure where you're going with it.

631
01:05:56,067 --> 01:06:01,011
But again, the idea here is that the housing is needed for people aging in place.

632
01:06:01,431 --> 01:06:08,437
And this is of particular benefit to a city because it is revenue positive by a huge measure.

633
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,121
And then the city council also explored whether or not to add short-term rentals.

634
01:06:15,321 --> 01:06:18,162
Paul Moki was particularly involved in this provision.

635
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:24,024
And we took a look at trying to remember where the example came from.

636
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:30,966
We looked at Cambridge and we looked at one other one and Paul and I kind of selected what we thought were the best features.

637
01:06:31,846 --> 01:06:33,287
And this is the product of that.

638
01:06:33,427 --> 01:06:39,809
So short-term rental would address things like VRBO or Airbnb housing

639
01:06:40,892 --> 01:06:53,435
and put some regulations in place so that a neighborhood isn't disrupted by people constantly just renting the structure and parties bothering people.

640
01:06:56,116 --> 01:07:04,758
Consistent with what's happened in other destination cities like New Orleans in the past two or three years.

641
01:07:08,755 --> 01:07:15,858
And those are the special residential regulations that the ordinance contemplated.

642
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:24,822
If I can go through one more, there are special district regulations.

643
01:07:25,282 --> 01:07:26,003
There's only two.

644
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:34,186
The old mixed use zoning district has got a lot of rules that don't lend themselves to placement in the dimensional section.

645
01:07:34,246 --> 01:07:38,328
So we just kept the language intact here and moved it over to a new home

646
01:07:38,765 --> 01:07:40,246
under special district regs.

647
01:07:42,086 --> 01:07:50,549
And then an innovative idea that the city council liked was section 9.2, and that is planned development district.

648
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:58,132
This comes from my experience in a few places, Quincy, Burlington, and Lexington to name three.

649
01:07:59,273 --> 01:08:05,495
Planned development district is an invitation, if you will, not a regulation, it's to

650
01:08:06,598 --> 01:08:14,041
ask the development community if they have a specific proposal for a piece of land that would be rezoned to a PDD.

651
01:08:14,221 --> 01:08:18,563
PDD can be either residential or commercial or mixed use.

652
01:08:19,544 --> 01:08:27,707
And this is essentially a rezoning of the parcel and then the city could always put it on special permit after that.

653
01:08:28,507 --> 01:08:30,548
But it has to be a partnership.

654
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:34,070
So if someone were to come to see the planning office and say,

655
01:08:35,512 --> 01:08:43,735
a widget factory on this parcel of land, in order for this to go anywhere, the planning department would have to say, good idea, let's take it up a notch.

656
01:08:44,535 --> 01:08:47,556
And then together they would draft the proposal.

657
01:08:47,716 --> 01:08:54,019
My experience is that cities are really bad at predicting what will work for developers.

658
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:58,200
They're not in the business of trying to turn a dime into a profit.

659
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:03,102
And so predicting things like a PUD does,

660
01:09:03,902 --> 01:09:05,643
generally don't attract any takers.

661
01:09:07,884 --> 01:09:13,368
PUD is typically some residential component, some commercial component, and some office component.

662
01:09:14,448 --> 01:09:20,372
But I mean, I know of a PUD that qualified in Salem that's a dentist office, a duplex, and a stop and shop.

663
01:09:21,072 --> 01:09:22,333
That's not what we had in mind.

664
01:09:23,054 --> 01:09:29,918
Quincy does these now in their larger commercial developments, and every one is a separate district.

665
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:31,859
If you drive Hartwell Avenue,

666
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:39,111
in Lexington on the west side of 128 from the 4-225 exit down to the next exit.

667
01:09:39,492 --> 01:09:40,892
Those are all PDDs.

668
01:09:41,012 --> 01:09:44,794
Every one of those is its own district because somebody had a different idea.

669
01:09:45,294 --> 01:09:49,476
And Burlington is doing the same thing with its old mall properties.

670
01:09:49,997 --> 01:09:53,619
The district, if you know where that is in Burlington, is a PDD.

671
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:58,581
These rules have to be written in a way that predict the outcomes.

672
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,462
So if you leave them too loosey-goosey,

673
01:10:01,167 --> 01:10:04,848
then the problem is that you probably won't get what you bargained for.

674
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:11,049
So the idea would be that there's an ordinance worked out between the city and the developer.

675
01:10:12,089 --> 01:10:15,230
The text of the amendment is up for grabs.

676
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:17,010
The map of the amendment is up for grabs.

677
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:18,311
The uses are up for grabs.

678
01:10:18,931 --> 01:10:25,072
It goes through the process of a preliminary plan and then a city council vote at the end of the day.

679
01:10:26,192 --> 01:10:29,953
When I just recodified Haverhill last year, this is in there.

680
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,580
We've now passed our first one.

681
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:39,462
It's a project that reuses an old banquet facility site on the Bradford side.

682
01:10:39,863 --> 01:10:43,804
And we liked the idea, we voted it, and I believe they're under construction already.

683
01:10:44,164 --> 01:10:47,465
There's another one coming downtown that we may do as a PDD.

684
01:10:48,685 --> 01:10:58,988
So this is the most, for me, this is the most progressive way to develop land in a partnership with a city.

685
01:10:59,745 --> 01:11:05,609
Uh, where the city is getting as well as giving and the developer, uh, is putting something in there.

686
01:11:05,629 --> 01:11:09,072
That's going to be a real benefit to the community.

687
01:11:11,553 --> 01:11:13,575
If it goes to special permanent, it need not.

688
01:11:13,715 --> 01:11:27,965
These are the criteria in section 9.2 0.7, Amanda nine to seven, but it truly has to be a partnership.

689
01:11:28,343 --> 01:11:29,825
This is what smart growth is.

690
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:33,529
If you take a look at chapter 40-R, then this is the same idea.

691
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:36,353
There's no spot zoning in chapter 40-R.

692
01:11:36,873 --> 01:11:40,477
And I think spot zoning is pretty much dead as a doctrine in 40-A as well.

693
01:11:47,826 --> 01:11:48,567
So I'll stop there.

694
01:11:57,135 --> 01:12:00,898
lot to, to absorb and we're going through it very, very quickly.

695
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:02,880
Yeah.

696
01:12:04,822 --> 01:12:10,507
Do any board members have questions or concerns they'd like to raise.

697
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:12,649
Interesting.

698
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:26,346
I just wanted to clarify on the plan development districts that this, this is something that the developer would have to pitch to the city.

699
01:12:27,086 --> 01:12:41,172
It's not something the city could, for instance, use to for purposes of a taking or some urban development, urban revitalization sort of project.

700
01:12:41,752 --> 01:12:43,153
No big partnership.

701
01:12:43,753 --> 01:12:43,913
Yep.

702
01:12:44,454 --> 01:12:45,214
So we'd have to come.

703
01:12:45,998 --> 01:12:50,839
For example, in Haverhill, there's a parcel, and I've been working for the city for 25 years.

704
01:12:51,319 --> 01:12:53,640
There's a parcel on the river called the paperboard site.

705
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,120
It was a factory, but it's got some solid waste, but it doesn't have anything dirty.

706
01:12:58,881 --> 01:12:59,961
Imagine what that could be.

707
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:04,062
I mean, the owner is not coming forward, but imagine if he did.

708
01:13:04,502 --> 01:13:06,202
He could build, they're over 10%.

709
01:13:06,362 --> 01:13:07,662
He could build luxury housing there.

710
01:13:07,682 --> 01:13:09,183
It could be a mixed-use destination.

711
01:13:09,503 --> 01:13:10,863
It could have restaurants on the river.

712
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:14,852
Sala Poli just built a 10 story building right on the river.

713
01:13:15,192 --> 01:13:16,572
We got some boardwalk out of it.

714
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:20,033
There's a restaurant on the 10th floor with a sunset view across the Merrimack.

715
01:13:20,073 --> 01:13:24,854
He's now coming in and he's gonna revamp the gecky deck, which is over in that section of the downtown.

716
01:13:25,154 --> 01:13:28,055
And he's got big ideas for that area as well.

717
01:13:28,295 --> 01:13:29,835
This is a device to let him do that.

718
01:13:32,056 --> 01:13:35,396
If you agree, if you don't agree, you can't do it.

719
01:13:37,217 --> 01:13:37,497
Thank you.

720
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:39,474
It's exciting.

721
01:13:40,114 --> 01:13:46,057
As you can tell, I really enjoy this kind of negotiation with somebody who wants to do the right thing, as you define it.

722
01:13:46,077 --> 01:14:02,383
Are there other board members who want to weigh in on this or the other pieces we talked about right before that?

723
01:14:06,993 --> 01:14:11,395
Attorney Borowski, I did have a question about the senior housing facility piece.

724
01:14:12,236 --> 01:14:15,697
That was senior housing facility.

725
01:14:15,717 --> 01:14:19,499
We didn't have the definition right in front of us.

726
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:22,000
Can you just remind us what that is?

727
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:26,222
Is that just any housing that's age restricted or does it have to have services?

728
01:14:26,783 --> 01:14:30,544
No, it's a bit broader than or narrower than that.

729
01:14:30,584 --> 01:14:32,505
So I'm just gonna scoot to my definitions here.

730
01:14:40,288 --> 01:15:03,777
too far so it is an assisted living facility as defined by general laws chapter 19d and there's a cmr as well continuing care facility as regulated by chapter 93 section 76 independent living doesn't have that kind of statutory oversight but you know i've

731
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:05,853
This is very common on the Cape.

732
01:15:06,173 --> 01:15:08,434
There's a gentleman down there by the name of Chris Wise.

733
01:15:08,474 --> 01:15:13,415
He runs facilities under the business name of Wise Living, and they're pretty much independent.

734
01:15:13,836 --> 01:15:17,197
So when you need assisted living, you're not in Chris's building anymore.

735
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:17,917
You're moving on.

736
01:15:18,437 --> 01:15:27,261
You could have home care come into an independent living facility, but at some point you graduate to assisted living, which is an entirely different structure.

737
01:15:27,841 --> 01:15:29,341
Long-term care facility is 105 CMR 150.

738
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:37,623
Senior housing is people 55 and older, and a senior housing facility is any one of those.

739
01:15:38,123 --> 01:15:47,629
And the laws that would govern here would be the Fair Housing Act and other federal legislation about discrimination.

740
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:56,974
So senior facilities are an exception to the otherwise applicable rule that housing cannot discriminate as to family composition.

741
01:15:57,234 --> 01:15:59,275
The exception is if one unit

742
01:16:00,006 --> 01:16:04,210
If 80% of the units have at least one person 55 and older.

743
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:07,473
So that's the structure of senior housing laws.

744
01:16:10,415 --> 01:16:12,837
And you can have all 55 and older.

745
01:16:14,138 --> 01:16:15,119
You just have to say that.

746
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:22,826
The later amendment called HOPA, Housing for Older Persons Act, allows you to have 100% 55 and older.

747
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:31,484
And which the senior housing facility, which zoning districts are those, are they limited to any?

748
01:16:32,465 --> 01:16:39,170
I think we picked the ones that allowed assisted living, long-term care, that kind of thing.

749
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:42,833
Let me open up the use regulations here.

750
01:16:54,903 --> 01:17:10,117
So they are allowed by city council special permit in the following districts SF one SF two gr apartment one apartment two apartment three C one C two, and music.

751
01:17:15,262 --> 01:17:19,186
And attorney rescue about the the museum district.

752
01:17:24,355 --> 01:17:29,078
do that's, that is existing language that we had on the books.

753
01:17:30,099 --> 01:17:37,665
And so in your opinion, the PDD is a better way to go or are they both useful?

754
01:17:39,926 --> 01:17:41,988
Well, remember, I just darn it.

755
01:17:42,048 --> 01:17:44,149
I just killed the use table.

756
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,472
It's easy to get back.

757
01:17:47,612 --> 01:17:50,714
So in MUZ, you're prescribing what I can do.

758
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:51,795
It's, it's straight.

759
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:54,051
forward prescription.

760
01:17:54,111 --> 01:18:01,777
So multiple dwelling class A, multiple dwelling class B. Other things that would be allowed are community centers.

761
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,799
I'm going deeper into this.

762
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:17,850
It would allow open space recreational uses, open public recreational uses, private entertainment, recreation facility, public entertainment,

763
01:18:19,255 --> 01:18:26,797
club or lodge, trade professional or other school, hotels, large and small, brewery or tap room.

764
01:18:26,817 --> 01:18:35,280
You know, this is fine, it's pretty open, business professional, business government, medical, no, not business government.

765
01:18:36,681 --> 01:18:39,962
Medical office would be allowed, banks, financial institutions.

766
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:46,604
So there may be enough flexibility here for somebody to do what they wanna do in MUZ,

767
01:18:48,203 --> 01:18:52,824
but you don't, for example, allow an eating place without a drive-through, that's a prohibited use.

768
01:18:53,504 --> 01:18:57,265
And then all of the motor vehicle uses are prohibited.

769
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:02,627
And it may be that this isn't exactly what I wanna do.

770
01:19:03,247 --> 01:19:10,949
So I could come in and I could add something to the MUZ by a council amendment, but I could propose exactly what I wanted to do under the plan development district.

771
01:19:13,475 --> 01:19:29,854
And I believe the only section of the city that is the MUZ is the Wellington, the development along the river next to the Wellington station area.

772
01:19:30,294 --> 01:19:30,454
Yeah.

773
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:41,957
Great, thank you.

774
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:44,199
So we've kind of covered a lot right here.

775
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:54,227
There's accessory dwelling units, we've got short-term rentals, we've got the MUZ district, the planned development district, the senior housing piece.

776
01:19:55,127 --> 01:20:00,832
Are there members of the public that would like to speak on these topics?

777
01:20:05,776 --> 01:20:07,057
Yes, Mr. Snyder.

778
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:10,800
Hi, it's William Snyder at 87 Warren Street.

779
01:20:11,510 --> 01:20:14,792
Um, I have a few comments on aid.

780
01:20:14,812 --> 01:20:18,715
I'm not sure attorney Bob Roski needs to weigh in.

781
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,997
So you can tell me if I want to go through them.

782
01:20:21,037 --> 01:20:36,947
I have just a I can start and you can tell me, you know, we can wait till after but on the on the ad you one of the things I noticed was that it requires if you can at least one additional parking space.

783
01:20:37,808 --> 01:20:40,950
And it says at least one additional and

784
01:20:41,785 --> 01:20:53,894
I was wondering if that was still covered by the, I'm sensitive to maximum parking spaces at a single family or single SF2 property.

785
01:20:54,855 --> 01:20:56,896
And so currently that's four.

786
01:20:57,297 --> 01:21:02,220
And is this still limited at four or is the ADU let somebody put in five or even more than five?

787
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:05,002
And I just recommend that be clarified.

788
01:21:05,022 --> 01:21:11,047
Hang on, I'm trying to take notes and I'm going back to the ADU.

789
01:21:12,542 --> 01:21:13,042
Yep.

790
01:21:13,523 --> 01:21:26,330
I'm not sure if it's actually in the ADU part, but there's a, there's a place where it says, I think maybe even earlier where it says you have to put in one additional space if you can, at least one.

791
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:26,910
Yeah.

792
01:21:27,611 --> 01:21:28,631
I'll see if I can find that.

793
01:21:29,152 --> 01:21:29,452
Okay.

794
01:21:29,492 --> 01:21:31,633
Just give me the section number so I can find it again.

795
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:33,014
Hold on.

796
01:21:33,034 --> 01:21:39,918
I'm looking at the ADU is eight two.

797
01:21:39,938 --> 01:21:40,038
Yes.

798
01:21:44,188 --> 01:21:52,934
Yeah, sufficient for, yeah, it's section 8.2.3. looks like seven, six.

799
01:21:54,155 --> 01:22:03,461
Yeah, so that kind of implies that if I put an ADU, I can break the maximum limit on a dwelling unit and just start putting as many as I want.

800
01:22:03,981 --> 01:22:04,342
Oh, okay.

801
01:22:04,382 --> 01:22:07,964
And I don't, personally, I don't like that.

802
01:22:08,084 --> 01:22:08,985
I don't recommend that.

803
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:13,648
I think it would be, if somebody had two, maybe they could put in three

804
01:22:14,439 --> 01:22:21,545
but I think there is still the four space limit on a single family, an SF1 property.

805
01:22:21,565 --> 01:22:22,346
Yeah.

806
01:22:26,369 --> 01:22:27,129
Okay, good point.

807
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:38,839
And the other point for that 8.2 just real quick is I didn't get from reading it, it wasn't clear to me that the special permit requirements only applied to special permit.

808
01:22:38,999 --> 01:22:40,240
So that needs to be clarified.

809
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,322
If I'm building the ADU in my house,

810
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:46,563
I don't need to do any of those plot plans or anything like that.

811
01:22:46,623 --> 01:22:46,843
Right.

812
01:22:48,084 --> 01:22:51,427
You have to show it to the building inspector, but I see what you're saying.

813
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:51,667
Yeah.

814
01:22:51,907 --> 01:22:52,207
Okay.

815
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:57,391
It's not clear which of those requirements apply to the by right case.

816
01:22:57,992 --> 01:22:58,752
I think you're right.

817
01:22:58,772 --> 01:23:03,476
And I will put, I'll put building commissioner or SPGA as the case may be.

818
01:23:03,496 --> 01:23:04,697
Yeah.

819
01:23:05,177 --> 01:23:08,299
And, um, uh, let's see.

820
01:23:10,061 --> 01:23:11,402
Um, and then.

821
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:26,171
In the short term rentals, it wasn't clear, it wasn't clear in the city should specify whether if I have an ADU, but I live in the main house, can I use the ADU as a short term rental?

822
01:23:26,411 --> 01:23:29,193
I assume the intent is no, but.

823
01:23:29,253 --> 01:23:39,477
No, if you look, it says an affidavit number two, 8232, an affidavit, David shall be provided stating that one of the two dwelling units shall be occupied by the owner.

824
01:23:39,497 --> 01:23:40,938
So the owner can move into the ADU.

825
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:42,670
and rent the larger home?

826
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:45,231
Oh, they can do either way.

827
01:23:45,592 --> 01:23:45,792
Yes.

828
01:23:46,432 --> 01:23:53,895
And, and is that, is that, is that a 90 day limit or they can, or they can, I'm talking about the short term rental.

829
01:23:54,075 --> 01:23:55,335
Oh, the short term rental.

830
01:23:55,475 --> 01:23:55,716
Okay.

831
01:23:55,796 --> 01:23:56,036
Yeah.

832
01:23:56,076 --> 01:24:03,039
The question is if I have an ADU in my house, can I short term rent it or is it, or is it, or is it excluded because I don't ever live there?

833
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:06,780
I think that's not clear.

834
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:07,720
Okay.

835
01:24:11,029 --> 01:24:12,070
Just I'm sure the city.

836
01:24:12,371 --> 01:24:20,840
I'm sure the intent is not to have the ad use become short term rentals but if that is allowed it's one of those different one of those two options should be spelled out.

837
01:24:22,862 --> 01:24:24,965
Looking at the definition to see if it does.

838
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:25,425
Yeah.

839
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:44,516
A primary residence is a residential unit in which an operator resides for at least nine months out of a 12 month period.

840
01:24:47,158 --> 01:24:55,584
So the requirement to the short term rental is that the operator slash owner has to be there nine out of 12 months.

841
01:25:00,907 --> 01:25:04,490
And so it seems the intent is that you couldn't

842
01:25:04,972 --> 01:25:14,116
you couldn't permanently live in the main house and 365 days a year rent out the ADU as a short term.

843
01:25:15,356 --> 01:25:18,858
Yeah, that might need some clarification in the language.

844
01:25:19,098 --> 01:25:19,898
Okay, no problem.

845
01:25:20,479 --> 01:25:22,099
Okay.

846
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,361
And I think that's about it.

847
01:25:27,021 --> 01:25:29,062
I appreciate the board's help and your help.

848
01:25:29,742 --> 01:25:30,103
Thank you.

849
01:25:31,043 --> 01:25:33,404
Thanks for your careful reading, Mr. Snyder, appreciate it.

850
01:25:39,278 --> 01:25:45,420
Are there other members of the public who would like to speak on these housing issues?

851
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,882
Okay, let's continue.

852
01:25:56,442 --> 01:26:00,023
Okay, I'm gonna scroll back up to where we left off here.

853
01:26:02,584 --> 01:26:07,165
I believe we're on section 10 now, and that is your linkage.

854
01:26:09,973 --> 01:26:11,374
sections just rolled over.

855
01:26:13,075 --> 01:26:24,463
I did, there was a lot of redundancy, so I tried to consolidate some of the language up front in 10.1 is the basic rule, but it was repeated every time you had another linkage fee.

856
01:26:24,963 --> 01:26:29,206
So I didn't see the need for that again and again and again.

857
01:26:29,366 --> 01:26:32,629
So no, so I, this is what you have.

858
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:36,391
I did not change any functional requirement here.

859
01:26:36,932 --> 01:26:37,092
So

860
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:42,374
And you'll see that each of them has a section that parallels the next.

861
01:26:43,195 --> 01:26:49,140
So the credits is repeated, for example, in each of the subsections.

862
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:54,544
So 10.1.6 is credit for, you know, park recreational land.

863
01:26:55,945 --> 01:27:00,128
Then the whole pattern repeats for fire and police facilities.

864
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:05,953
And it makes me very jealous to see that you have this because everybody should have this.

865
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:07,174
Right.

866
01:27:11,482 --> 01:27:18,206
I long ago was engaged by Franklin to do impact fees.

867
01:27:18,726 --> 01:27:20,647
We approached the legislature.

868
01:27:21,147 --> 01:27:29,592
Franklin was the fastest growing town in Massachusetts at the end of the eighties and the legislature passed it, but Weld had taken a no new tax promise.

869
01:27:30,272 --> 01:27:34,755
And he didn't want to stand on some platform somewhere, try to distinguish an impact fee from a tax.

870
01:27:35,355 --> 01:27:36,496
So he pocket vetoed it.

871
01:27:37,456 --> 01:27:38,977
We then tried it under home rule.

872
01:27:39,769 --> 01:27:40,990
We imitated what St.

873
01:27:41,030 --> 01:27:43,692
John, Florida had done the county on schools.

874
01:27:44,573 --> 01:27:45,634
We hired the same people.

875
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:46,915
We wrote the same ordinance.

876
01:27:47,015 --> 01:27:50,958
It was defended successfully at the Florida Supreme Court.

877
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:54,221
It was home ruled just like Massachusetts and we got kicked.

878
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:58,004
So I'm still bitter as you can tell.

879
01:27:58,024 --> 01:28:06,872
All right, so administration and enforcement, this administration section up front here,

880
01:28:07,532 --> 01:28:11,534
was vetted by Paul, so he's had his fingerprints all over this.

881
01:28:12,615 --> 01:28:15,316
I love the posting of public notification panels.

882
01:28:15,656 --> 01:28:16,857
I think that's a great idea.

883
01:28:16,957 --> 01:28:20,038
It's very common elsewhere, but you rarely see it in Massachusetts.

884
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:22,019
And I think it's great.

885
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:31,984
One of the reasons I think it's great is because if you were to post building permits as well, then your neighbor would only have 30 days to appeal the building permit.

886
01:28:32,064 --> 01:28:35,766
It would be adequate notice for them to have to take advantage of it.

887
01:28:36,066 --> 01:28:37,027
And you might think about,

888
01:28:37,717 --> 01:28:47,243
adding to 11.2.1 or the recipient of a building permit for new construction shall add one of these notification panels.

889
01:28:47,623 --> 01:28:50,265
The only town I know that does that is Wellesley.

890
01:28:52,626 --> 01:28:56,349
So you're making them put up the panel for notice of the public hearing.

891
01:28:57,389 --> 01:29:02,773
Wellesley makes them put up the notice for the successful grant of a building permit.

892
01:29:03,013 --> 01:29:06,235
And the case law that's developed from that, I think is very,

893
01:29:08,075 --> 01:29:19,484
beneficial to the person who got the building permit because unless your neighbor takes you to the ZBA within 30 days, they lose their right to later seek zoning enforcement.

894
01:29:19,824 --> 01:29:21,986
That statute of limitation is six years.

895
01:29:22,807 --> 01:29:28,131
So you could go through the process of building the building and then face a challenge four years in.

896
01:29:29,272 --> 01:29:31,294
Think about that as a possible amendment.

897
01:29:32,975 --> 01:29:35,117
Again, we're still in Paul's department enforcement.

898
01:29:35,734 --> 01:29:43,656
I don't think you had the proper language for the, I'm going back to look at the color coded draft.

899
01:29:44,037 --> 01:29:48,698
I think you were a little, you were shorting yourself on the amount that you could collect as a penalty.

900
01:29:49,518 --> 01:29:59,101
And I also added here the possibility of taking, of doing this as a non-criminal disposition.

901
01:29:59,601 --> 01:30:05,023
Think of a zoning violation being treated like a parking, a traffic ticket.

902
01:30:06,703 --> 01:30:13,645
So the only way you can get money from a zoning violation is to take the person who you, the $300 a day fine.

903
01:30:13,665 --> 01:30:20,368
You have to go to a district court jury of six, show cause to the magistrate first, and then have a trial.

904
01:30:20,428 --> 01:30:21,988
And if you win the trial, you get the money.

905
01:30:22,368 --> 01:30:24,989
You don't normally get all of it, but you can get some of it.

906
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:33,933
The non-criminal disposition provision allows you to just have Paul issue a traffic ticket and,

907
01:30:35,933 --> 01:30:42,496
you know, it kind of goes up in these are, you know, you could change these numbers easily.

908
01:30:42,556 --> 01:30:44,437
It's 11.3.3, Amanda.

909
01:30:45,578 --> 01:30:51,001
So 50 bucks, 20 bucks, 25 bucks for the first offense, 50 for the second, 100 for the third, 200 for the fourth.

910
01:30:58,544 --> 01:31:00,405
The next section's Board of Appeals.

911
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:03,947
We basically shortened it up a little bit

912
01:31:04,343 --> 01:31:06,324
It had a lot of repetition of the statute.

913
01:31:07,445 --> 01:31:16,089
And, you know, it's these days, everybody knows how to Google mass general laws and you can see what statute says in 13 seconds.

914
01:31:16,609 --> 01:31:20,071
So just citations generally suffice here.

915
01:31:20,411 --> 01:31:21,872
Otherwise we didn't change anything.

916
01:31:26,334 --> 01:31:29,155
Planning of the CDB rather didn't have a section.

917
01:31:29,576 --> 01:31:30,536
So what's up with that?

918
01:31:31,136 --> 01:31:31,536
We added 11.5.

919
01:31:34,364 --> 01:31:37,905
And we also added some provisions with regard to an associate number.

920
01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:43,287
So all of 11.5 is new and their powers are listed there as well.

921
01:31:47,428 --> 01:31:52,830
Under special permits, this is a rewrite of your generic special permit language.

922
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:57,132
So these are the criteria that I've used for a long time, 11.6.2.

923
01:31:58,272 --> 01:31:59,793
And I did legacy place using this.

924
01:32:03,947 --> 01:32:08,290
the Hebrew senior living facility on the top of the hill overlooking the Charles and Dedham.

925
01:32:08,971 --> 01:32:12,933
These really work because your board knows what they need to think about.

926
01:32:12,973 --> 01:32:19,598
The applicant knows what they need to prove and the abutters could pick their best shot at arguing that it should be conditioned or denied.

927
01:32:20,759 --> 01:32:22,620
And I can't think of anything that's left out here.

928
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:24,782
So do we need it?

929
01:32:25,342 --> 01:32:26,343
What's it due to traffic?

930
01:32:26,683 --> 01:32:27,824
How do the utilities work?

931
01:32:28,644 --> 01:32:32,507
What's happening to the neighborhood, natural environment?

932
01:32:32,982 --> 01:32:35,063
and potential fiscal impact.

933
01:32:35,083 --> 01:32:40,144
This is where the rethinking needs to occur if you're gonna take that out of the performance standards.

934
01:32:42,965 --> 01:32:45,106
The referral provisions are what you have now.

935
01:32:45,706 --> 01:32:48,927
Conditions, I've just added some examples as conditions.

936
01:32:50,948 --> 01:32:51,708
And there you have it.

937
01:32:52,469 --> 01:32:56,270
Now I'm gonna show you, if I can share screen, Amanda.

938
01:33:00,451 --> 01:33:01,231
You should be able to.

939
01:33:05,736 --> 01:33:19,742
So I'm going to show you something that I crafted because I reread the site plan section and I wasn't happy with it.

940
01:33:22,684 --> 01:33:23,924
So I gotta find it first.

941
01:33:24,144 --> 01:33:24,985
Oh, there it is, okay.

942
01:33:26,545 --> 01:33:32,708
Okay, so there was a land court decision after the first draft of this was prepared by Judge Foster.

943
01:33:34,098 --> 01:33:40,824
I advocate in site plan review that the appeal go directly to court under chapter 48, section 17.

944
01:33:42,745 --> 01:33:46,048
Remember site plan review is not a special permit.

945
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:47,589
It's not a variance.

946
01:33:47,810 --> 01:33:52,874
There's no language at all in the statute that talks about site plan review and there never has been.

947
01:33:53,034 --> 01:33:55,776
It's a creature of city government and the courts.

948
01:33:56,157 --> 01:33:58,979
So you can do pretty much any model you want.

949
01:33:59,059 --> 01:34:00,200
But judge Foster said,

950
01:34:00,964 --> 01:34:11,651
that if you're going to elect to take the appeal of the CDB decision, and it only applies to a CDB decision for a use as of right, that trips a certain threshold.

951
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:14,713
If there's gonna be an appeal, it should go directly to court.

952
01:34:14,873 --> 01:34:21,397
And Judge Foster's contribution fairly recently was, well, if that's the case, it ought to have a public hearing too.

953
01:34:22,097 --> 01:34:26,760
And that's kind of what was missing, particularly under the Dover section, which comes next.

954
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:29,802
So you can just see, I massaged this a little bit

955
01:34:30,237 --> 01:34:32,799
to, can you see this?

956
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:34,260
Yeah.

957
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:35,040
It's small.

958
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:37,462
I don't know if you could make it a little bigger, Amanda.

959
01:34:37,782 --> 01:34:39,203
Yeah, I can, I can make it.

960
01:34:39,323 --> 01:34:39,423
Okay.

961
01:34:39,443 --> 01:34:39,703
Sorry.

962
01:34:39,744 --> 01:34:41,164
This is you, Mark.

963
01:34:41,205 --> 01:34:41,685
This is me.

964
01:34:41,725 --> 01:34:41,925
Yeah.

965
01:34:51,011 --> 01:34:56,515
So what I did was tweak it in a couple of places, just to clarify, those are the things that trip it.

966
01:34:58,375 --> 01:35:06,302
So I wanted to make sure that the planning, the community development board was, because I'm using this terminology now, site plan review authority.

967
01:35:06,762 --> 01:35:08,524
This is the first place where I introduce it.

968
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:14,589
Didn't change much in the generic site plan review.

969
01:35:14,609 --> 01:35:19,313
A lot of stuff that are in the plans, this didn't change at all.

970
01:35:20,394 --> 01:35:23,817
So the decision, the board may approve proof of conditions or deny.

971
01:35:24,335 --> 01:35:32,300
when acting as the approval authority provided however that any denial shall be predicated only upon applicants failure to provide necessary information.

972
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:38,643
That's the holding in the case of Prudential Insurance versus Board of Appeals of Westwood.

973
01:35:39,184 --> 01:35:47,709
The Community Development Board may recommend approval or approval with conditions when the Board of Appeals or the city council is acting as a special permit granting authority.

974
01:35:48,209 --> 01:35:52,812
Any conditions limitations may be whether imposed or recommended

975
01:35:53,488 --> 01:36:02,130
as the case may be, will be in a written decision within 90 days after the close of the public hearing, that should say, I gotta fix that.

976
01:36:06,351 --> 01:36:10,292
And failure to file the 90 days shall be approval.

977
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:17,474
So what this does is set up the same structure for hearings that you would have for a special permit.

978
01:36:17,514 --> 01:36:19,755
But remember, a special permit is yes,

979
01:36:20,578 --> 01:36:22,499
No or yes with conditions.

980
01:36:22,799 --> 01:36:32,803
Site plan review by case law is yes or yes with conditions, but not no, except for that very limited no that can be had when the application was not complete.

981
01:36:33,924 --> 01:36:42,147
And then over here in the next section, which I've moved up to have one site plan section after the other, this is site plan review for Dover.

982
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:47,890
I've added the public hearing requirement because you're going to have a direct appeal to court.

983
01:36:48,150 --> 01:36:50,351
So you have to have this according to judge Foster.

984
01:36:51,690 --> 01:37:06,195
And in the section on decision, any denial predicated upon lack of information and any appeal under this section, meaning Dover site plan review to a court of competent jurisdiction.

985
01:37:06,295 --> 01:37:09,556
So just some cosmetic tweaks to make it clear what we're up to.

986
01:37:10,076 --> 01:37:15,338
And then I've moved the reasonable accommodation provision, which was between these two sections before to 11.9.

987
01:37:21,547 --> 01:37:26,771
And right now, the reasonable accommodation provision continues to be an important thing.

988
01:37:26,811 --> 01:37:36,179
I'm doing some work in Merrimack Valley City that involves drug and alcohol rehabilitation, all covered by disability law.

989
01:37:36,999 --> 01:37:45,105
And all I'm trying to do to a community is send a message, call your lawyer, get your lawyer on board here right away.

990
01:37:45,746 --> 01:37:47,027
This is not something to fool around with.

991
01:37:52,098 --> 01:37:54,581
And the last section is definition.

992
01:37:54,641 --> 01:38:00,507
So you'll see those rewrites in the 11.7 and 11.8 when the next draft is prepared.

993
01:38:00,887 --> 01:38:03,610
So I've taken copious notes, especially in the first meeting.

994
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:10,097
And what I would propose we do, are you going to go on with the public hearing and fidget a bit more with this?

995
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:16,932
I think we're gonna just talk a little bit about whether there are issues we wanna discuss further.

996
01:38:16,952 --> 01:38:28,835
Okay, I would be- I'm wondering if we should clarify a process because it's something that attorney Bobrowski was just saying, just so that we don't accidentally mess up his process with our process.

997
01:38:29,175 --> 01:38:38,778
I don't think I'm gonna do anything until you decide to give me a more global list after discussing it some more, which certainly is a good idea, so that I only do this once.

998
01:38:39,396 --> 01:38:46,360
So I thought we were sending a list to the city council for what they changes they we recommend they make.

999
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:47,180
That's fine.

1000
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:53,484
You mentioned doing another draft and I was confused if you were going to be sending that list to the city council.

1001
01:38:53,984 --> 01:38:58,086
Well, technically, it's your public hearing.

1002
01:38:58,386 --> 01:39:01,628
So your corrections to the draft are yours to make.

1003
01:39:03,338 --> 01:39:09,983
The process under chapter 48, section five delegates the public hearing to the planning board or the community development board.

1004
01:39:10,684 --> 01:39:17,609
In your case, the purpose of a public hearing is to think about what you want to do and change it if you don't want to continue on the same path.

1005
01:39:18,130 --> 01:39:24,955
So just as an example, striking utility, striking a fiscal analysis from the performance standards.

1006
01:39:25,575 --> 01:39:27,857
Well within your wheelhouse, you can do that if you want to.

1007
01:39:28,137 --> 01:39:32,521
And then you can send over a draft to the city, to the city council and then

1008
01:39:33,266 --> 01:39:39,531
The city council is the original drafts person of this but the public hearing is not their responsibility it's yours by statute.

1009
01:39:40,352 --> 01:39:54,164
So we should come up with a process where we collectively come up with your list and then we have a city council subcommittee, perhaps or the full council, and we run this list by them, and they pick and choose which ones they want to make and I get instructions and I only do it once.

1010
01:39:56,048 --> 01:39:56,228
Right.

1011
01:39:56,268 --> 01:40:03,814
And I've, you know, Attorney Borowski, you've been taking some notes and at certain points you've said, oh, that's a good, I should fix that language.

1012
01:40:04,074 --> 01:40:06,135
Are you tracking all of those little things?

1013
01:40:06,215 --> 01:40:06,676
Because.

1014
01:40:07,036 --> 01:40:07,236
Yep.

1015
01:40:08,217 --> 01:40:08,397
Yep.

1016
01:40:08,497 --> 01:40:13,140
I've got copious notes from first meeting and I've got more notes tonight, so I know exactly where to go with it.

1017
01:40:13,441 --> 01:40:17,163
I'm doing, I'm right at about the same stage in Bridgewater right now on draft 14.

1018
01:40:17,443 --> 01:40:23,688
We had the public hearing, the chairman of the planning board had a bunch of changes, but he had a bunch of changes before and we way overshot.

1019
01:40:24,190 --> 01:40:28,612
And now I had to pull all that stuff back out and I don't want to do that again.

1020
01:40:28,772 --> 01:40:30,352
So I want to meet with the planner.

1021
01:40:30,412 --> 01:40:33,893
I'm meeting with her on Monday and we're going to go through the master list created.

1022
01:40:33,913 --> 01:40:35,674
I'm going to make the changes if we go from there.

1023
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:36,754
Right.

1024
01:40:37,074 --> 01:40:45,817
I think my expectation was that we're going to identify as many areas tonight as we can.

1025
01:40:45,837 --> 01:40:47,498
I think the

1026
01:40:48,938 --> 01:41:02,164
OCD staff planning staff is going to write it up and I will work to make sure that all of the concerns that we've conveyed are adequately represented in that draft.

1027
01:41:02,684 --> 01:41:15,990
And then we will bring it back on January 5th so that the public can see what our recommendations are and we can have a final conversation about it before we give it to, well, to the city council.

1028
01:41:17,030 --> 01:41:17,251
Okay.

1029
01:41:18,955 --> 01:41:22,497
And I talked with Amanda today about me joining you on the 5th.

1030
01:41:23,297 --> 01:41:28,359
So I think we can compare and coordinate our lists.

1031
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:36,883
Perhaps if I have a minute, I'll send my list so that I, well, it's fresh in my mind, especially for tonight's stuff.

1032
01:41:37,364 --> 01:41:43,006
And you can take into consideration what I've identified and add to it or subtract from it.

1033
01:41:43,866 --> 01:41:44,047
Right.

1034
01:41:44,347 --> 01:41:44,927
That would be great.

1035
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:53,572
But the whole point would be to take to the city council your best recommendation for the changes that should be made.

1036
01:41:53,772 --> 01:42:03,195
And I mean, ultimately I leave to you deciding who controls that final decision because the statute does put it in your hands.

1037
01:42:04,231 --> 01:42:09,193
Right, well, there are points at which you mentioned, oh, I'll try to take a stab at that language.

1038
01:42:09,213 --> 01:42:30,702
So I'm wondering whether given the notes that you've taken, you could provide to the planning staff your new red line version so that they can compile whatever kind of technical changes you've made and along with our recommendations.

1039
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:47,357
Yeah, doing well, I mean, like doing a red line version of changes that will not get accepted in the next, in your list or in the city council's list to two lists more to go is a lot of work for, and then I'm gonna have to pull out the changes.

1040
01:42:47,877 --> 01:42:59,622
So what I'd rather do is give you a list and then you prepare your list and then we'll take our list to the city council and then I'll hear from them and then I'll prepare the new draft and that'll be the last draft draft 10.

1041
01:43:03,422 --> 01:43:07,005
Okay, so sorry, just to clarify.

1042
01:43:07,145 --> 01:43:09,867
I'll give you a bulleted list of what I think I heard.

1043
01:43:10,688 --> 01:43:13,410
You can do the same, Alicia leads the charge.

1044
01:43:14,330 --> 01:43:15,692
We'll then have two lists.

1045
01:43:15,752 --> 01:43:18,534
We'll coordinate those lists just by discussing them.

1046
01:43:19,494 --> 01:43:23,918
If it calls for new language, I may give you that language in the list.

1047
01:43:24,538 --> 01:43:30,303
For example, on the special permit for signs bigger, parking less.

1048
01:43:31,181 --> 01:43:34,943
We found some good language in section 6.4 that we might just use there.

1049
01:43:35,823 --> 01:43:41,226
And then we'll coordinate our lists, if you will, and then we'll take that to the city council.

1050
01:43:42,206 --> 01:43:42,466
Okay.

1051
01:43:42,626 --> 01:43:45,147
And that coordination, we'll do that at the next meeting.

1052
01:43:45,628 --> 01:43:46,648
Sounds like a good idea.

1053
01:43:46,788 --> 01:43:46,948
Yep.

1054
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:47,548
Okay.

1055
01:43:47,969 --> 01:43:51,250
And I'm having an operation, so I have all the time in the world to do this.

1056
01:43:53,387 --> 01:43:56,208
You need to recuperate from your operation.

1057
01:43:56,228 --> 01:43:59,270
No, I'm looking at this as a real opportunity.

1058
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:00,631
You want me to come to a meeting?

1059
01:44:00,771 --> 01:44:02,552
I'm getting a Lincoln Town car.

1060
01:44:02,892 --> 01:44:03,952
So I can't drive.

1061
01:44:03,972 --> 01:44:04,913
It's my right leg.

1062
01:44:07,114 --> 01:44:08,735
My wife's hid the car keys somewhere.

1063
01:44:08,795 --> 01:44:09,515
I don't know where they are.

1064
01:44:09,535 --> 01:44:13,657
Sorry to hear that.

1065
01:44:13,737 --> 01:44:21,921
And we may be in touch just about some of the logistics, because I think what we were anticipating was that there would be a list of very specific

1066
01:44:22,542 --> 01:44:27,003
changes and or language substitutions that we would send to the council.

1067
01:44:27,023 --> 01:44:30,504
So it'd be very simple for them to accept or decline.

1068
01:44:30,524 --> 01:44:38,566
I just, I really wanted to make sure we weren't doing double duty by the, by you doing a draft and us doing the list without realizing.

1069
01:44:38,586 --> 01:44:47,087
I'm happy to do the draft, but my experience in Bridgewater was that we went rushing past what the appetite was of the public.

1070
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:49,608
And then they said, pull it all back.

1071
01:44:50,298 --> 01:45:03,509
And now I've got another list that I have to figure out because the chairman of the planning board has been there for a long time and he's a good guy and he's trying to do the right thing, but politically he sometimes overruns the appetite of the people in the room.

1072
01:45:03,649 --> 01:45:03,809
So.

1073
01:45:07,232 --> 01:45:07,673
Well, thank you.

1074
01:45:07,753 --> 01:45:14,659
And I know, uh, attorney Roski, you, uh, need to step out and I know, uh, director hunt you do as well.

1075
01:45:14,819 --> 01:45:14,999
So.

1076
01:45:16,173 --> 01:45:18,195
I'll let you both do that right now.

1077
01:45:18,255 --> 01:45:20,457
And thank you for participating tonight.

1078
01:45:20,838 --> 01:45:21,058
Great.

1079
01:45:21,078 --> 01:45:22,640
I think I'll see you on January 5th.

1080
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:24,281
So everybody have a great holiday season.

1081
01:45:24,822 --> 01:45:24,982
Yes.

1082
01:45:25,022 --> 01:45:25,342
Thank you.

1083
01:45:25,362 --> 01:45:25,702
You too.

1084
01:45:26,103 --> 01:45:26,503
Thank you.

1085
01:45:27,024 --> 01:45:27,344
Thank you.

1086
01:45:27,364 --> 01:45:33,330
And I'm leaving Amanda and Vic for anything, and I can watch the video if there's anything I need to see the details of.

1087
01:45:34,171 --> 01:45:34,411
Great.

1088
01:45:35,712 --> 01:45:36,032
Thank you.

1089
01:45:39,175 --> 01:45:40,717
So we really

1090
01:45:42,216 --> 01:45:45,477
blew quickly through a lot of stuff tonight.

1091
01:45:46,597 --> 01:46:10,683
And so I just want to take a moment to kind of slow down and let the members and members of the public kind of weigh in and see if there are things that even if you don't have recommended language that we should take a closer look at or that you may be concerned about or things that you want to process a little bit more.

1092
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:17,498
So let me open it up to the CD board members first.

1093
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:24,122
And I guess, why don't I, I'm gonna put people on the spot.

1094
01:46:24,182 --> 01:46:26,183
I'm gonna take everybody's temperature.

1095
01:46:26,563 --> 01:46:35,608
If I can just go around the board and hear what everybody thinks about what we've done over the last couple of meetings and what they've seen.

1096
01:46:39,138 --> 01:46:39,859
David, I see you.

1097
01:46:40,779 --> 01:46:41,280
I'll go first.

1098
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:44,141
I'll go, David, and then I'll take, go to Jackie after that.

1099
01:46:45,502 --> 01:46:45,803
Sorry.

1100
01:46:45,943 --> 01:46:52,327
I just have to.

1101
01:46:52,347 --> 01:47:06,117
Well, I feel like we've been through, we were part of our, these two meetings, I think was really to let Mark run his presentation and just sort of get some general feedback.

1102
01:47:06,337 --> 01:47:07,658
I, I'm not sure.

1103
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:17,522
Like for instance, a special permit, in my opinion, one person's opinion for a medical office to 5000 square feet in the city of this size.

1104
01:47:18,603 --> 01:47:20,243
To me that threshold needs to be changed.

1105
01:47:20,443 --> 01:47:27,545
I wasn't going to bring that up tonight because it's such a small item it wasn't worth everyone's attention or discussion.

1106
01:47:28,886 --> 01:47:36,788
I don't know are we abbreviating this so much that we're not going to get to the finer details if we're just taking the global discussion that we've had the last two meetings and

1107
01:47:37,161 --> 01:47:38,602
and running right to a draft.

1108
01:47:38,902 --> 01:47:40,464
That's my top concern.

1109
01:47:43,346 --> 01:47:58,117
Well, no, I definitely think that you should identify those items so that we can try to at least put them into a list of things that we can, you know,

1110
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:05,132
process over the next few weeks and that maybe the planning staff can try to put into a list with language.

1111
01:48:05,652 --> 01:48:11,855
And then on January 5th, we can go through them and see if that's everything that we want.

1112
01:48:11,955 --> 01:48:17,957
So I don't know, David, if you have a list of things, maybe it would be good for public record for you to go through them.

1113
01:48:22,039 --> 01:48:23,339
So I don't know, what do you think?

1114
01:48:28,441 --> 01:48:33,664
Yeah, I just, I don't know that I would have everything ready to go right now to go through.

1115
01:48:33,964 --> 01:48:46,231
I'm happy to put together a list between now and January 5th, but I also want to be sensitive to the process and whatever public disclosures we need to have participation, so.

1116
01:48:46,931 --> 01:48:47,111
Right.

1117
01:48:48,112 --> 01:48:49,192
Well, can I ask a question?

1118
01:48:49,232 --> 01:48:57,157
Does it make sense if as a board, we sort of narrow down the list of what we feel

1119
01:48:58,532 --> 01:49:06,635
as a board are the most critical components and then hone in on those because some are just whatever, but some are pretty material.

1120
01:49:07,215 --> 01:49:19,800
And so which ones as a board do we feel are the most material that need to, that deeper dive and set a process for that within a reasonable timeframe and for public input.

1121
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:24,482
I just, I wasn't at the last meeting personally.

1122
01:49:25,971 --> 01:49:49,383
I didn't, I don't have the benefit of those discussions just sort of reading the notes after, so I don't have a lot of context of the discussion, but, you know, a lot of things around housing and I'd like to take a closer look at, or the things that David has raised, I'd like to take a closer look at, but I think all of us probably have

1123
01:49:51,055 --> 01:49:55,058
things that are more important to us, but if we maybe just sort of narrow it down.

1124
01:49:55,138 --> 01:49:56,079
I don't know if that makes sense.

1125
01:49:56,319 --> 01:50:01,043
I'm just trying to get to a place where we can decide like these are the most material things.

1126
01:50:02,544 --> 01:50:02,744
Right.

1127
01:50:03,845 --> 01:50:05,286
Well, I think that.

1128
01:50:08,554 --> 01:50:13,377
you know, obviously the sooner we can get this back to the city council, the better so they can take action on it.

1129
01:50:13,477 --> 01:50:16,198
That's one thing that we're hoping to do.

1130
01:50:16,398 --> 01:50:24,123
I mean, this is a lot of material, so I don't wanna short change that effort.

1131
01:50:24,963 --> 01:50:34,468
But I think, you know, to the extent that we can identify tonight a list of things for the planning staff to compile, and then if,

1132
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:53,427
individually, you know, board members want to send thoughts to the planning department, they can compile a list that in advance of the next meeting, we can share with the public and each other.

1133
01:50:54,297 --> 01:50:56,199
and discuss at the next meeting.

1134
01:50:56,239 --> 01:51:03,146
And then we can, you know, it's always easier to look at something once it's written down and go through it in a list format.

1135
01:51:03,186 --> 01:51:06,510
So I think that's what I'd like to try to get to for the fifth.

1136
01:51:07,050 --> 01:51:17,221
And then if it turns out we, some of these things require a lot, you know, more conversation, you know, we can continue it again.

1137
01:51:21,255 --> 01:51:43,608
Yeah, it seems like there are a lot of like specific numbers that we need to review, like as far as square footage, when things are required that I'm not sure like how those numbers were developed and maybe some that don't exist, like the fiscal analysis, maybe there's some size that we add for when that would be required.

1138
01:51:46,189 --> 01:51:47,830
Yeah, I know you've been trying to speak.

1139
01:51:49,743 --> 01:51:54,284
Yes, sorry, I'm having technical difficulties with my phone as well as my laptop.

1140
01:51:54,304 --> 01:51:58,505
But I just pretty much there are there's one in particular that I am a little concerned about.

1141
01:51:58,525 --> 01:52:02,666
And that's the use of the TDM, and it's or something like that for transportation.

1142
01:52:02,686 --> 01:52:05,966
And I kind of thought that Deanna was gonna chime in on that one.

1143
01:52:06,506 --> 01:52:11,207
And just but I don't have a specific question right now for it.

1144
01:52:11,527 --> 01:52:15,188
It's more so just something I wanted to look at even further.

1145
01:52:15,288 --> 01:52:15,368
And

1146
01:52:15,933 --> 01:52:24,595
One of the suggestions you made was for us to give comments before the January 5th meeting, but perhaps we just go and take a look at it again tonight.

1147
01:52:24,635 --> 01:52:31,857
I don't know how helpful that'll be for myself even, only because it's just a couple of things that I'm trying to digest.

1148
01:52:31,917 --> 01:52:36,238
And I know for the sake of time, we want to get this before the city council.

1149
01:52:36,398 --> 01:52:42,040
However, there are just some, again, as Christy and David has said, there are some

1150
01:52:42,859 --> 01:52:45,199
I just don't know where to get to from this document right now.

1151
01:52:45,239 --> 01:52:53,221
I'm trying to get it so it's digestible and that we're not just dealing with like little tiny details that are neither here nor there.

1152
01:52:53,321 --> 01:52:57,942
But I want to make sure we get to the gut of it, but at the same time, not miss anything.

1153
01:52:59,802 --> 01:53:11,465
Before we had divided and conquered, we paired up and said, you two people look at these sections that you may be more interested in or

1154
01:53:13,227 --> 01:53:18,612
align with our experience and, you know, take a look at those, develop your comments on that.

1155
01:53:18,652 --> 01:53:35,749
So I don't know if that's a way to do it where, you know, we can just, everybody takes certain sections and says, and just focuses on those, gets their comments in before the 5th, and then planning can compile all that.

1156
01:53:38,209 --> 01:53:40,331
Well, we can do that.

1157
01:53:41,051 --> 01:53:58,325
And so the idea that I had for this section of the meeting was to really hear from all of you, if there are pieces of it that you're particularly interested in that you need to be, you want to dig into more or that you want to flag for further conversation.

1158
01:53:59,046 --> 01:54:03,930
So Jackie, you know, you just mentioned, I think the TDM was at the Transportation Demand Management.

1159
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:05,271
Yes.

1160
01:54:06,091 --> 01:54:06,692
I can take out,

1161
01:54:07,315 --> 01:54:08,336
take a closer look at it.

1162
01:54:08,976 --> 01:54:19,163
It sounded all you know consistent with what I've done or seen in other towns working on development projects, but I can take a closer look.

1163
01:54:20,844 --> 01:54:22,465
Right, I think you know my sense is that.

1164
01:54:23,878 --> 01:54:25,959
Attorney has worked in a number of communities.

1165
01:54:25,979 --> 01:54:31,261
A lot of this language is stuff that has been used before by other communities.

1166
01:54:31,401 --> 01:54:38,824
And I think the question that we need to ask about different sections is, is this appropriate for our community?

1167
01:54:39,644 --> 01:54:51,289
And Jackie, are there other pieces that stand out to you

1168
01:54:53,188 --> 01:54:54,028
you wanna dig into?

1169
01:54:57,169 --> 01:55:04,212
There are, if we can, actually, I know Amanda stopped sharing her screen and I don't have access to my materials in front of me.

1170
01:55:04,712 --> 01:55:17,297
There was a section that David had called out earlier, but I wasn't sure what my stance was on it at the time of, but if we can go back a couple, I don't know if Amanda can share her screen again.

1171
01:55:17,317 --> 01:55:19,258
Sure, yes, I can.

1172
01:55:19,958 --> 01:55:22,319
Do you recall what section it was roundabout?

1173
01:55:23,141 --> 01:55:30,788
David if you can help me out here there was a section that you called out and you want to know if anyone else had any concerns about it and it was at the time of, I was not sure that I did.

1174
01:55:39,876 --> 01:55:42,158
I talked about the discretion in the board is that.

1175
01:55:43,610 --> 01:55:47,714
It wasn't so much a discretion of the board, it was about being sensitive to neighborhood character.

1176
01:55:48,114 --> 01:55:50,156
And I just cannot recall what section that was.

1177
01:55:50,776 --> 01:55:54,960
I raised that in connection with the noise standards.

1178
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:56,461
The noise standards.

1179
01:55:56,881 --> 01:56:06,329
I did also run, I did sort of find throughout for the word character, thinking that it would lead me to some others.

1180
01:56:06,449 --> 01:56:10,273
And there might be some, I just wasn't able to complete that project.

1181
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:28,210
You saw what I was trying to do was, instead of using that buzzword, actually try to focus on what's germane to the topic, which here would be, I thought, the introduction of new noises or the increase in noises, which are a couple of things we want to try to avoid.

1182
01:56:32,073 --> 01:56:32,433
I agree.

1183
01:56:32,473 --> 01:56:46,119
I mean, I think that we as a board have expressed in the past consensus about wanting to replace that language with language that's, you know, maybe more neutral.

1184
01:56:49,921 --> 01:56:50,141
Yeah.

1185
01:56:54,183 --> 01:56:54,543
And I think

1186
01:56:55,970 --> 01:57:13,776
you know, that some of these introductions, they don't, they're not the substance of it, but we don't wanna do anything that's gonna get us into trouble by saying this is what the purpose of it is, you know, as we're implementing it.

1187
01:57:15,877 --> 01:57:19,438
Especially, Andre, as you pair that with discretion later on in the section too.

1188
01:57:19,838 --> 01:57:20,018
Right.

1189
01:57:20,038 --> 01:57:21,019
So suddenly.

1190
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:21,339
Exactly.

1191
01:57:24,175 --> 01:57:26,477
I definitely agree with that.

1192
01:57:29,999 --> 01:57:38,285
I had a few items, Andre, if you just wanted kind of overall topics, like a short list.

1193
01:57:39,826 --> 01:57:51,575
I was really struck by the discussion of how we define a family and what a single family dwelling is under the ordinance.

1194
01:57:52,735 --> 01:57:59,399
how appropriate it is to talk about those who are related and then how many unrelated folks could be within the same dwelling.

1195
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:08,344
So I did some research on that and I think it's a problematic area.

1196
01:58:10,865 --> 01:58:20,171
One of the first things I saw is that in New York state in 1989, the state's highest court found that to be violative of due process.

1197
01:58:21,475 --> 01:58:23,136
under the state constitution.

1198
01:58:23,156 --> 01:58:43,288
So obviously we don't have the same state constitution as New York, but the point of the matter was that it was found to some, to essentially be not tied directly enough to a zoning rationale and to be somewhat, well, to be discriminatory as to related people and unrelated people.

1199
01:58:43,308 --> 01:58:48,531
You know, essentially you can't have as many unrelated people living in one home as you can related.

1200
01:58:49,152 --> 01:58:50,052
How does this make sense?

1201
01:58:51,560 --> 01:59:08,773
It seems that there's been an effort by some communities to avoid this type of a basis to determine what a single family, and you don't have the terminology in front of me, but what a single family house is, or a dwelling, or a home.

1202
01:59:10,954 --> 01:59:18,480
And I noticed, so I tried to take a deeper look on this, and Somerville, which I always look to as an example,

1203
01:59:19,334 --> 01:59:26,637
clearly I've put so many resources into their zoning ordinance, it's only a couple of years old, does follow the same paradigm that we have.

1204
01:59:27,597 --> 01:59:29,998
But Newton, for instance, does not.

1205
01:59:30,198 --> 01:59:44,603
So in Newton, instead of defining the dwelling by kind of the number of occupants or how many family and unrelated folks are within it, just focuses on defining the dwelling unit by the number

1206
01:59:45,007 --> 01:59:46,568
the actual characteristics of it.

1207
01:59:47,488 --> 01:59:56,634
So it's a habitable unit for one family with facilities used or intended to be used for living, sleeping, cooking, eating, sanitation.

1208
01:59:56,674 --> 02:00:03,138
So this would be a paradigm shift.

1209
02:00:03,178 --> 02:00:11,883
You'd have to kind of redefine dwelling single family, dwelling two family, move away from

1210
02:00:13,073 --> 02:00:21,170
know, the number of unrelated members, and, and really focus on the characteristics of the dwelling itself.

1211
02:00:25,871 --> 02:00:32,636
I don't know where that leaves us, but I thought that I was really struck by the comments from the public on the topic.

1212
02:00:32,896 --> 02:00:35,818
And I felt like I needed to get my head into it and I did.

1213
02:00:35,938 --> 02:00:37,759
And I found that I think it is kind of a problem.

1214
02:00:37,919 --> 02:00:43,043
And I think that if we're doing this, we probably should try to use the best practices.

1215
02:00:46,385 --> 02:00:50,368
And do you have that language from Newton?

1216
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:57,095
Is that something that we could maybe put on the list for consideration?

1217
02:00:57,936 --> 02:00:58,336
Exactly.

1218
02:00:58,376 --> 02:00:59,477
I could put that on the list.

1219
02:00:59,777 --> 02:01:05,742
And so it would lead itself to a number of definitions needing to be updated.

1220
02:01:05,802 --> 02:01:07,544
So you have to define a dwelling unit.

1221
02:01:07,664 --> 02:01:13,849
You have to define a single family detached or two family detached dwelling.

1222
02:01:15,192 --> 02:01:17,893
There would be a little bundle of updates to do.

1223
02:01:18,153 --> 02:01:23,015
Well, David, if the definition of family is just modified.

1224
02:01:24,556 --> 02:01:34,180
Well, so for instance, you don't necessarily have to do the definition of family is just wrong, because I could see this could personally that could personally impact me.

1225
02:01:34,761 --> 02:01:42,664
To be honest, I have family that's not blood or married, and we live together as a family.

1226
02:01:44,367 --> 02:01:48,168
Right, so Newton just doesn't even use the term family.

1227
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:49,008
That's not the point.

1228
02:01:49,328 --> 02:01:51,369
It's not in the zoning ordinance at all.

1229
02:01:52,849 --> 02:01:56,930
I mean, the word is used, but it's not defined and set as a standard.

1230
02:01:57,470 --> 02:02:09,553
Right, but we could, I mean, just as a possibility to consider too, we could just define a family by its functional characteristics, right, of people, kind of the housekeeping unit, basically.

1231
02:02:13,394 --> 02:02:13,594
Yeah.

1232
02:02:16,848 --> 02:02:20,870
And I think that's where they're trying to get by defining it as a dwelling unit.

1233
02:02:21,390 --> 02:02:30,253
Like, okay, this is a place where living, sleeping, cooking, eating, and sanitation occurs.

1234
02:02:32,174 --> 02:02:34,235
Well, okay, I would do that with my family.

1235
02:02:34,955 --> 02:02:35,175
Right.

1236
02:02:35,375 --> 02:02:37,056
Amanda, could you stop sharing your screen?

1237
02:02:37,076 --> 02:02:39,117
Thanks.

1238
02:02:39,537 --> 02:02:41,878
We can always go back to it at certain points.

1239
02:02:43,457 --> 02:02:46,779
All right, well, let's- That's a big thing.

1240
02:02:47,819 --> 02:03:09,710
Right, so David, I think if you could send that language to the planning staff, if you have a suggestion, and then if anybody else would also like to suggest an approach to that, then we could maybe compare them and make a decision over the next meeting.

1241
02:03:13,895 --> 02:03:26,520
Andre it's Jackie, I would like to work with David on that only because it's the landmark law cases in reference to planning is something that I have just delved into.

1242
02:03:26,740 --> 02:03:31,262
And if he doesn't mind, I would love to work on him with the language.

1243
02:03:32,522 --> 02:03:32,742
Great.

1244
02:03:33,242 --> 02:03:37,404
Yes.

1245
02:03:38,224 --> 02:03:41,766
I had a couple of other, other items Andre on my list here.

1246
02:03:43,879 --> 02:04:12,874
And that is I share the comments of Mr Snyder tonight, talking about not encouraging folks to maximize parking spaces on their property and notice that Somerville, and I don't think Medford does is very clear about driveways, encouraging the surfaces that are used on driveways to be

1247
02:04:15,435 --> 02:04:18,197
Porous ribbon driveways are encouraged.

1248
02:04:18,717 --> 02:04:26,842
You have to get a permit to put it in the driveway, a discouragement of going to the maximum allowed in terms of the number of spaces.

1249
02:04:28,743 --> 02:04:36,348
It's just become a pet peeve of mine I've seen a number of properties where it seems like front lawns are no longer front lawns they're turning into parking areas.

1250
02:04:37,229 --> 02:04:39,510
Folks are paving over the hill strip.

1251
02:04:41,483 --> 02:04:43,945
to accommodate more, more parking.

1252
02:04:44,706 --> 02:04:54,955
So, I could throw some of this stuff in there but, you know, if I'm just chasing windmills and I can let it go to.

1253
02:04:56,316 --> 02:05:03,923
I think, I think that's something that we'd be interested in, in seeing David if you, if you have a specific proposal around it.

1254
02:05:05,777 --> 02:05:07,638
And then I thought it was quick.

1255
02:05:08,398 --> 02:05:31,148
No, I was just gonna say the, you know, we talked a lot at the last meeting in November about parking and making a recommendation about adjusting the parking minimum, at least until, you know, in a, in an intermediate way until the master plan is done and there can be a more nuanced kind of conversation about it.

1256
02:05:32,072 --> 02:05:35,995
but I think it's worth not, right now, like everything needs a parking variance.

1257
02:05:36,316 --> 02:05:39,578
And if we can eliminate some of that, that would be great.

1258
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:57,912
And, you know, the other piece of the conversation around parking with the ADUs, I think we should take a look at that to consider whether, you know, parking spaces is required in all cases.

1259
02:05:59,221 --> 02:06:12,365
you know, I think as Mr. Snyder said, if there's already an ample driveway there, for example, is there, do you need to, is that adequate, right?

1260
02:06:14,865 --> 02:06:20,947
If I could jump in for just a second, and maybe this isn't the right time for this, but I just wanted to,

1261
02:06:23,872 --> 02:06:34,497
point out that we actually have a number of submitted written comments that were sent in to us and actually even a couple like as the meeting had just started.

1262
02:06:34,717 --> 02:06:39,999
And so I put all of the new ones in the meeting material folder for folks to view as well.

1263
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:45,382
But I guess more to the point, a bunch of them happen to be around parking.

1264
02:06:46,422 --> 02:06:47,703
And so I wasn't sure if

1265
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:57,635
Now is an appropriate time or if we're going to move to a public comment period after kind of board discussion to share some of those.

1266
02:06:58,335 --> 02:06:59,296
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1267
02:06:59,316 --> 02:07:09,922
I wanted to get the board members to identify their areas of interest and concern right now and then we'd open it up to the public.

1268
02:07:10,522 --> 02:07:10,782
Got it.

1269
02:07:13,792 --> 02:07:15,593
I have one more item on my wish list Andre.

1270
02:07:16,154 --> 02:07:17,255
Yeah, go ahead.

1271
02:07:18,235 --> 02:07:18,876
Feel indulged.

1272
02:07:21,218 --> 02:07:23,259
I just thought it was of interest.

1273
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:26,582
The development in Boston in the fall.

1274
02:07:28,243 --> 02:07:41,633
For the encouragement of affordable housing that parking minimums, at least the city council approved a great large reduction elimination of parking minimums in connection with affordable housing developments.

1275
02:07:44,696 --> 02:07:57,295
So to your point of finding rationale on occasion for a lower parking requirement, maybe that category could be encouraged as well.

1276
02:07:59,217 --> 02:08:23,594
And on that topic, the city just had a class of MIT graduate students working on some kind of theoretical development issues around zoning, looking at different types of development and how to increase in a sensitive and sensible manner housing, especially affordable housing in the city.

1277
02:08:24,394 --> 02:08:39,581
And so they were looking at some specific some city owned parcels, in terms of what might be some of the you know the issues, or how might the city want to proceed and in doing their number crunching which was really impressive.

1278
02:08:43,258 --> 02:08:50,343
requirements that were needed for a lot of these things were way under what we currently require for parking.

1279
02:08:50,884 --> 02:08:56,188
So that study is going to be finalized pretty soon because the class is ending.

1280
02:08:56,488 --> 02:09:02,312
And that's, I think, a great resource for us as well to take a look at, because they've done a lot of work on that.

1281
02:09:06,976 --> 02:09:07,476
Absolutely.

1282
02:09:09,578 --> 02:09:11,979
And with that, I'll hand the floor back.

1283
02:09:12,440 --> 02:09:12,700
Thank you.

1284
02:09:16,547 --> 02:09:20,550
Thanks, Deanna, did you wanna, any thoughts about?

1285
02:09:22,691 --> 02:09:25,694
No, I share the same thoughts as David.

1286
02:09:25,874 --> 02:09:31,458
The family definition from the last meeting was definitely important one we have to put more thought into.

1287
02:09:31,478 --> 02:09:42,726
And then if I recall, there was also a lot of discussion on the daycare definitions and how many kids were allowed.

1288
02:09:42,746 --> 02:09:46,028
I don't know if we should revisit that at some point as well.

1289
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:50,542
I don't know what people's thoughts on that.

1290
02:09:50,642 --> 02:09:58,267
I think, are we going to go through Amanda's list that she had sent with the notes from last time?

1291
02:09:58,907 --> 02:10:00,848
I don't think we're going to have time to do that.

1292
02:10:01,249 --> 02:10:10,154
I think that will be part of the written set of... Okay.

1293
02:10:11,375 --> 02:10:14,116
I think we need to revisit a lot of those from the last meeting.

1294
02:10:14,837 --> 02:10:15,377
Yeah, agreed.

1295
02:10:18,576 --> 02:10:20,377
I don't think I have anything else to add right now.

1296
02:10:21,858 --> 02:10:24,619
Thanks.

1297
02:10:24,659 --> 02:10:26,721
Christy, did you have any further thoughts?

1298
02:10:32,104 --> 02:10:39,087
No, I mean, I share the same interest in the sections that people have noted to date.

1299
02:10:39,147 --> 02:10:47,172
And I think I'd really like to look at the special permit section again, and the residential section.

1300
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:49,201
in more detail.

1301
02:10:49,221 --> 02:10:51,582
Yeah.

1302
02:10:53,743 --> 02:10:56,585
What did people think about the the plan development districts?

1303
02:10:57,686 --> 02:10:59,427
That's a pretty new thing.

1304
02:10:59,807 --> 02:11:06,852
And I think essentially, what it is, is it creates floating zoning, and that

1305
02:11:09,876 --> 02:11:19,778
you know, property owners working with the city could propose changes to the zoning that could be approved through the plan development district.

1306
02:11:23,059 --> 02:11:37,622
Having increased flexibility is, I think, a very positive thing, but, you know, it's also something that's different, right?

1307
02:11:37,702 --> 02:11:38,582
It's a little bit more,

1308
02:11:40,426 --> 02:11:48,350
take development as it comes rather than putting the district guidelines in place beforehand?

1309
02:11:51,692 --> 02:11:54,433
Well, it should come with increased benefits to the community.

1310
02:11:54,453 --> 02:11:58,615
I mean, I think that's what really needs to be looked at.

1311
02:11:58,675 --> 02:12:08,580
If developers have the flexibility to get increased FAR or other uses, then

1312
02:12:09,445 --> 02:12:11,105
that's gonna be like the trade-off.

1313
02:12:11,145 --> 02:12:14,966
So I think it's really taking a look at that and making sure that it's balanced.

1314
02:12:15,786 --> 02:12:17,407
Right, I think that's a great point, Christy.

1315
02:12:18,967 --> 02:12:31,010
I know that it does say the city can require as part of that up to 20% affordable housing, but we should kind of look at that a little bit more.

1316
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:47,304
And folks, the fiscal analysis, I know there's a lot of concerns about that, how it's written.

1317
02:12:48,765 --> 02:12:55,728
Is your sense that we just should take it out or recommend taking it out, or should we try to fix the language?

1318
02:12:56,589 --> 02:13:01,251
And just a reminder that all the recommendations that we send are recommendations.

1319
02:13:01,851 --> 02:13:05,813
So if we send a recommendation saying, oh no,

1320
02:13:07,441 --> 02:13:20,068
think we should have the fiscal analysis, but the city council likes that idea, and they could reject our recommendation if we don't necessarily send along language to improve it.

1321
02:13:21,249 --> 02:13:25,011
So we just have to consider both approaches.

1322
02:13:28,973 --> 02:13:30,834
I hate the language the way that it's written now.

1323
02:13:34,316 --> 02:13:35,396
But you're correct.

1324
02:13:35,576 --> 02:13:36,757
I think it's better to have

1325
02:13:37,758 --> 02:13:41,942
present an alternative language, then just say, take it out.

1326
02:13:42,462 --> 02:13:47,687
Might get, might have a little more legs with a proposal for editing.

1327
02:13:51,070 --> 02:13:51,831
Andre, this is David.

1328
02:13:52,011 --> 02:14:04,021
I thought you were right on the money, equating it to the, at least it's where my mind was going, equating it to the consultant that the board can hire for more information would be at the expense basically of the,

1329
02:14:05,396 --> 02:14:07,176
the proponent, the applicant for us.

1330
02:14:08,417 --> 02:14:27,200
And so I think we could probably very easily recast that to something that could be, could be required of a development as opposed to having it mandatory, maybe soften it up while we're at it as well.

1331
02:14:27,441 --> 02:14:34,682
Should we, should it be required of all developments or, or just over a certain threshold or like larger developments?

1332
02:14:42,467 --> 02:14:43,168
I guess that's a good question.

1333
02:14:43,188 --> 02:14:49,273
It gets hard once you start trying to set that, because then there's always going to be projects under or over.

1334
02:14:51,755 --> 02:14:52,815
So I wonder if there's a way.

1335
02:14:52,855 --> 02:15:02,403
I think we have to think about it a little bit more and see whether, in the language itself, we can create criteria for when it may be considered or may be appropriate.

1336
02:15:07,187 --> 02:15:10,530
That's just my thought, but I'm open to other ideas.

1337
02:15:15,522 --> 02:15:15,962
I agree.

1338
02:15:15,982 --> 02:15:18,324
Okay.

1339
02:15:19,024 --> 02:15:25,948
Well, since we do want to end by nine o'clock, I want to make sure there's time for the public to weigh in.

1340
02:15:26,048 --> 02:15:36,554
So why don't we take Mr. Pompeo, who's had his hand up for a long time, and then Amanda, you can read the written comments that have come in.

1341
02:15:39,775 --> 02:15:41,076
Thank you, Steven Pompeo.

1342
02:15:41,636 --> 02:15:42,357
I appreciate this.

1343
02:15:43,107 --> 02:15:49,550
I just want to clarify, will the general public also have time to digest all this?

1344
02:15:50,030 --> 02:16:01,556
We've had the attorney explain everything to us over the last two meetings, and now it seems like we need some time to digest it and then bring it up again at the January 5th meeting.

1345
02:16:01,576 --> 02:16:10,340
But is there a deadline by which we should submit things to the planning department if we want to get those included in the January 5th meeting?

1346
02:16:13,659 --> 02:16:15,840
Uh, that is a very good point.

1347
02:16:22,824 --> 02:16:37,492
You know, rather than bringing things up, you know, fresh at that next meeting, maybe we could, um, get them submitted and have them incorporated by the planning department and brought up all at once, uh, at the junior fifth meeting.

1348
02:16:38,313 --> 02:16:38,493
Right.

1349
02:16:39,178 --> 02:16:48,896
The challenge you know with a public meeting laws is that we can't have conversation offline, that the conversation has to be a meeting.

1350
02:16:49,157 --> 02:16:49,397
So,

1351
02:16:51,025 --> 02:17:02,075
We may have to just ask everybody to, you know, submit their suggestions in writing and the board will compile ours and members of the public can submit theirs.

1352
02:17:02,615 --> 02:17:17,728
And then that'll be part, all of that will be part of the materials before the January 5th meeting where we can actually discuss the specific written language and decide whether or not to include it in our recommendations.

1353
02:17:19,175 --> 02:17:30,083
So I guess my suggestion would be if the meeting's on January 5th, we should ask members of the public to get their comments in by the end of this calendar year.

1354
02:17:32,385 --> 02:17:33,466
Does that sound right, Amanda?

1355
02:17:33,766 --> 02:17:34,547
Would that be enough time?

1356
02:17:37,549 --> 02:17:37,930
Yes.

1357
02:17:40,872 --> 02:17:47,017
Yes, I'm just thinking about if there's anything that bars, like, I think,

1358
02:17:49,269 --> 02:18:07,037
that anything that comes into us, that's a written comment from someone who identifies their name and address, needs to be filed and understood to be part of the record for a hearing.

1359
02:18:07,697 --> 02:18:16,681
And so what I don't know is if it's possible to have kind of a deadline prior to the hearing ending

1360
02:18:17,806 --> 02:18:19,107
where we need to hear things by.

1361
02:18:19,867 --> 02:18:20,067
Right.

1362
02:18:20,928 --> 02:18:37,778
Well, I guess let me encourage the members of the public to get it in as early as possible because the longer, the more advanced that we have, that can be, the staff can circulate the materials as a prep materials to us and we can digest it more.

1363
02:18:38,198 --> 02:18:40,960
That way on the fifth, we're not coming in cold.

1364
02:18:42,721 --> 02:18:45,002
So that'd be my suggestion, but yes, Amanda's right.

1365
02:18:45,022 --> 02:18:45,723
I mean, you can,

1366
02:18:46,645 --> 02:18:47,445
There's no time limit.

1367
02:18:47,465 --> 02:18:54,529
You can submit your comments anytime before January 5th or during the meeting of January 5th.

1368
02:18:54,589 --> 02:19:03,673
It's just a question of, you know, it's always better with more time to consider it.

1369
02:19:07,455 --> 02:19:07,775
Thank you.

1370
02:19:07,795 --> 02:19:08,876
Mr. Lessenhop.

1371
02:19:15,795 --> 02:19:35,841
Hi, I just wanted to, and I apologize, I did miss some of the discussion about this topic, but just in case, on the accessory dwelling units provision, I think in general, I would just advocate in favor of not overly restricting those or not putting too many burdensome regulations on those.

1372
02:19:36,121 --> 02:19:42,503
It's not clear to me from the language if they have to be included in an existing dwelling or if

1373
02:19:43,172 --> 02:19:45,753
or structure, or if you can construct a new one.

1374
02:19:45,773 --> 02:19:53,456
I've heard talk about residency, or sorry, not residency, but like family relation requirements.

1375
02:19:53,496 --> 02:20:07,341
And I would just advocate against too many of those because I think that ADUs will be successful if we make it as easy as possible for sort of ordinary people to even build them on their property or convert something they already have.

1376
02:20:07,881 --> 02:20:10,502
So with the caveat that I did miss some of that discussion,

1377
02:20:11,861 --> 02:20:15,671
I would just put that general general comment in to the record.

1378
02:20:16,132 --> 02:20:18,238
And sorry, Alex Wilson have 30 right Avenue.

1379
02:20:20,043 --> 02:20:20,344
Thank you.

1380
02:20:21,777 --> 02:20:47,226
Yeah, one thing that we did talk about just so you know is that the what we received from the city council would allow accessory dwelling units as of right within existing single family homes, and it would be special permit for detached dwellings but there's an important distinguish it's for existing detached dwelling so like a garage or a carriage house or something.

1381
02:20:47,646 --> 02:21:01,737
And I think one thing that we identified during our conversation we might want to look at a little bit more is, do we want to allow a path for a new detached unit, like a tiny home?

1382
02:21:10,744 --> 02:21:10,984
Right.

1383
02:21:13,846 --> 02:21:14,767
Amanda, do you want to

1384
02:21:17,848 --> 02:21:22,769
Mr. Navarro, and then we'll have Amanda talk, take the written comments.

1385
02:21:23,549 --> 02:21:24,749
I'm a member of the public.

1386
02:21:24,789 --> 02:21:26,170
I don't know if you see me, I'm on the phone.

1387
02:21:26,870 --> 02:21:27,490
Okay, great.

1388
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:32,571
Yeah, why don't we go to you first, because Mr. Navarro has spoken, so then we'll go to him after.

1389
02:21:32,591 --> 02:21:33,931
All right.

1390
02:21:34,051 --> 02:21:36,512
My name is Mary Anna Ducey, and I live at 2 North Street.

1391
02:21:37,692 --> 02:21:42,073
I did not attend the last meeting, but I read the article that was in the Medfit transcript.

1392
02:21:42,988 --> 02:21:46,451
I'm basing my comments tonight on what I read in the newspaper.

1393
02:21:46,491 --> 02:21:49,433
They may not be totally accurate, but that's what I'm doing here.

1394
02:21:49,493 --> 02:21:50,554
And I live on the Hillside.

1395
02:21:50,614 --> 02:21:54,617
So my perspective is from the point of view of a resident from the Hillside.

1396
02:21:55,538 --> 02:22:03,124
Um, to get back to this, this definition of family, I think most people in the public understand what a term family means.

1397
02:22:03,824 --> 02:22:08,688
Although I know there's domestic partnerships, there's those building people with living with significant others.

1398
02:22:09,101 --> 02:22:19,846
But I think the differentiation becomes important when you try to determine if it's over four people living in an apartment, because then it becomes a boarding house as opposed to a regular tenant.

1399
02:22:20,666 --> 02:22:22,527
But that's my point of view.

1400
02:22:22,547 --> 02:22:27,229
But I think it's widely understood out there in the public what a family unit is.

1401
02:22:27,249 --> 02:22:37,274
If you open the door otherwise, you could allow social groups like fraternities or sororities to consider themselves a family unit, because you've got a number of people that live together.

1402
02:22:37,923 --> 02:22:40,645
So that's a factor you might want to consider too.

1403
02:22:42,866 --> 02:22:52,131
If a dwelling is considered, because of the number of residents there, a boarding house, I think a boarding house should be considered or treated as a business.

1404
02:22:53,912 --> 02:23:03,197
For instance, most of these situations are probably where absent landlords are not present.

1405
02:23:03,798 --> 02:23:07,620
So if they rent a property to like say, whatever the legal limit is for,

1406
02:23:08,136 --> 02:23:11,717
And then the tenants invite other people to live in there.

1407
02:23:11,857 --> 02:23:13,457
It's hard to regulate that.

1408
02:23:14,198 --> 02:23:17,939
The landlord, I'm sure he's not going to go check on the number of tenants that are there all the time.

1409
02:23:18,919 --> 02:23:34,183
So if you consider these, quote, boarding houses as rental property, then the owners of the buildings must have to get a license to operate.

1410
02:23:34,243 --> 02:23:35,563
It's like any other kind of business.

1411
02:23:36,061 --> 02:23:40,662
And then there would be some kind of formal regulations.

1412
02:23:40,962 --> 02:23:47,304
And these properties then should be subject to periodic safety inspections and other potential violations of occupancy limits.

1413
02:23:48,264 --> 02:23:56,386
So if you consider these, quote, boarding houses as businesses, then they fall under the rules that a normal business would have.

1414
02:23:57,306 --> 02:24:03,068
And as far as the number of boarding houses you could have in your area, if a street has

1415
02:24:04,475 --> 02:24:10,557
a certain number of residents there, they shouldn't allow the whole street to be taken over by, quote, boarding houses.

1416
02:24:11,097 --> 02:24:16,858
So the residents should have some input on what kind of facilities are going into their neighborhoods.

1417
02:24:20,199 --> 02:24:26,700
For instance, in my neighborhood, somebody told me that they lived in an apartment on Winthrop Street that had six residents until a few months ago.

1418
02:24:27,081 --> 02:24:31,662
They knew that they were too over the limit, but they needed the extra people to pay the rent.

1419
02:24:33,361 --> 02:24:38,043
It's more or less a problem of the owners of these buildings.

1420
02:24:38,383 --> 02:24:44,685
They charge so much on the rents that these tenants have to invite other people to live with them so they can share the rent.

1421
02:24:45,806 --> 02:24:51,188
Also, when there's an absent owner, they do very little to maintain the property.

1422
02:24:51,208 --> 02:24:54,629
I've got one in my neighborhood that's got siding hanging from it for over a year.

1423
02:24:55,209 --> 02:25:02,312
And I told the owner when he came in August, because the previous tenants had moved out, that it was hanging there, could fall down and hit somebody.

1424
02:25:03,172 --> 02:25:04,493
He didn't he said yeah, I'll take care of it.

1425
02:25:04,513 --> 02:25:04,774
Well here.

1426
02:25:04,794 --> 02:25:08,657
It is December It still hasn't been taken care of and then another friend.

1427
02:25:08,737 --> 02:25:26,252
I know up on the hillside has 12 students living next door The only common room that they have in her in that house is the kitchen because they've they've using all the other rooms in the house as Bedrooms the dining room the living room the bedrooms the attic and the basement so

1428
02:25:28,070 --> 02:25:51,847
This woman doesn't want to report it because she feels as though these kids will retaliate because a couple years ago There was a group there that retaliated against her by stealing some of her property because she reported them so That's the perspective of somebody who lives there We think one of my neighbors think that tough should be doing more to provide more on-campus housing for the students rather than

1429
02:25:52,893 --> 02:25:58,575
making them live in the neighborhoods here because the whole neighborhood is pretty much an extension of Tufts now.

1430
02:25:59,495 --> 02:26:09,298
And the Tufts should not be allowed to buy any more houses and taking them off the tax rolls here and converting them to housing.

1431
02:26:09,338 --> 02:26:12,458
They should be building property on their own property.

1432
02:26:12,978 --> 02:26:18,940
They have room down off of Powder House Square there that they have a big empty field near the football field.

1433
02:26:19,160 --> 02:26:20,761
They could certainly build housing there.

1434
02:26:22,648 --> 02:26:25,949
These are just some of the thoughts that I have as a Hillside resident.

1435
02:26:26,549 --> 02:26:29,751
And as I said, I did not participate in the last meeting.

1436
02:26:29,791 --> 02:26:34,772
I haven't been following this all along until I saw this article in the Medford Transcript newspaper.

1437
02:26:35,393 --> 02:26:38,474
So that's about all I need to want to say right now.

1438
02:26:40,194 --> 02:26:40,875
Thank you very much.

1439
02:26:40,895 --> 02:26:42,515
Appreciate your comments.

1440
02:26:44,016 --> 02:26:46,977
And we understand the certainly the

1441
02:26:47,522 --> 02:26:52,646
the tensions around that and some of the pressures, particularly around the college.

1442
02:26:55,648 --> 02:26:56,349
Mr. Navar.

1443
02:26:57,510 --> 02:26:59,971
William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1444
02:27:02,776 --> 02:27:21,807
On the draft of this recodification that I looked at quite some time back, under the ADU section, there's a requirement that every five years, the owner has to recertify that they live in one of the dwellings, I guess, in order to continue legally using the ADU.

1445
02:27:21,967 --> 02:27:27,711
Is that still in the, do we know if that's still in, excuse me, in the most modern draft?

1446
02:27:31,812 --> 02:27:33,513
Amanda's gonna bring that up, I think.

1447
02:27:33,533 --> 02:27:34,433
All right, thanks.

1448
02:27:44,837 --> 02:27:50,840
And maybe, if it is, I'll just continue as if that's true, because that's what it was, the one I looked at.

1449
02:27:51,160 --> 02:27:52,681
But I know there are drafts floating around.

1450
02:27:53,761 --> 02:27:55,942
Basically, I understand the impulse.

1451
02:27:56,002 --> 02:28:00,944
I don't think it's a terrible thing to want the main house to be owner-occupied.

1452
02:28:02,539 --> 02:28:04,280
So I'm not accusing anyone of that.

1453
02:28:04,721 --> 02:28:17,127
But my concern is that in the real world where this has been tried, people have had a lot more trouble getting loans to build the ADUs when this is a requirement.

1454
02:28:17,627 --> 02:28:27,532
Because obviously, if the bank is going to seize the property for non-payment of mortgage foreclosures, I guess that'd be called,

1455
02:28:29,463 --> 02:28:31,165
They're not going to be able to rent that out.

1456
02:28:31,325 --> 02:28:38,431
And I guess maybe they'll even have a harder time finding a buyer who is going to get value from that ADU.

1457
02:28:39,932 --> 02:28:43,896
Because if they plan to be a landlord, you can imagine a lot of situations.

1458
02:28:44,136 --> 02:28:48,060
And apparently, in the real world, people have found that this has been an impediment.

1459
02:28:48,420 --> 02:28:52,784
So I just want the Community Development Board to take that into account.

1460
02:28:53,915 --> 02:28:58,879
I found something from the AARP of Connecticut, and I think the one in California said something very similar.

1461
02:28:58,919 --> 02:29:21,815
They said, owner occupancy covenants, I know this isn't the covenant, but I think it works similarly, or conditions give pause to homeowners and institutions financing home purchases because of the limits they place on successive owners who will not be able to rent out or lease their main house, which might be necessary as a result of a divorce, job transfer, or death.

1462
02:29:22,315 --> 02:29:44,412
They can also make financial institutions reluctant to provide financing for construction of an accessory apartment because the covenants put a restriction on the mortgage lender's security of the property and lenders may withhold consent to any owner occupancy requirement that takes the form of a covenant.

1463
02:29:45,563 --> 02:29:48,624
So basically, I just think that that's a real concern.

1464
02:29:48,664 --> 02:29:57,946
And while it doesn't seem insane on its face to require owner occupancy, it sounds like the real world situation is that might basically prevent a lot of ADUs going up.

1465
02:30:00,446 --> 02:30:00,726
Thanks.

1466
02:30:00,746 --> 02:30:02,207
It's a good point.

1467
02:30:02,267 --> 02:30:10,929
I think there may be another way of accomplishing the goal by doing it a little differently.

1468
02:30:13,872 --> 02:30:16,975
I know in California, they recently did some legislation.

1469
02:30:16,995 --> 02:30:28,484
And one of the things there was basically when you built the thing, I don't think it's for ADUs, but basically they had something like you had to certify that you intend to live there for so many years and then that sort of falls away.

1470
02:30:30,746 --> 02:30:31,487
Something like this.

1471
02:30:31,787 --> 02:30:34,049
I think Arlington also grappled with similar issues.

1472
02:30:34,089 --> 02:30:35,830
So it might be interesting to look at what they did.

1473
02:30:35,850 --> 02:30:38,833
All right, thank you.

1474
02:30:38,853 --> 02:30:42,476
I think, I mean, just go ahead, Amanda.

1475
02:30:42,937 --> 02:30:54,214
I was just going to say to answer your initial question about that five year expiration, it is the language still is in the draft, and I can show it if people want.

1476
02:30:54,234 --> 02:30:57,579
Sure, why don't you put it up real quick.

1477
02:31:15,041 --> 02:31:30,285
I do think it's a little problematic to try to be tracking all these special permits, like of individual apartments and have them, you know, these renewals come back to us.

1478
02:31:32,745 --> 02:31:40,227
You know, especially, I mean, once there's, hopefully there'll be like a few hundred someday and that's,

1479
02:31:41,195 --> 02:32:06,261
It seems like a strange way of doing that, whereas perhaps just when there's a new rental unit or there's a new tenant coming into a rental unit, there could be a way of having a building inspection perhaps where that gets taken care of and it's not actually having to renew the special permanent in front of a board.

1480
02:32:08,642 --> 02:32:09,142
Thanks, Amanda.

1481
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:13,632
Why don't you read the written feedback that you've gotten?

1482
02:32:18,035 --> 02:32:19,736
Yes, okay.

1483
02:32:22,698 --> 02:32:23,499
So many tabs.

1484
02:32:23,679 --> 02:32:27,761
Okay, so maybe I'll group some of them.

1485
02:32:28,682 --> 02:32:32,905
There were a number that dealt with parking in particular.

1486
02:32:32,925 --> 02:32:32,965
So,

1487
02:32:39,777 --> 02:32:42,078
Okay.

1488
02:32:42,179 --> 02:32:44,620
This is from Ellery Klein on Fells Avenue.

1489
02:32:45,701 --> 02:32:58,949
Dear Community Development Board, I envision a future for Medford where families could use one or zero cars because of our robust network of bike lanes, safe walking infrastructure, healthy squares, and good public transit.

1490
02:32:59,449 --> 02:33:01,831
The first step towards this is to lower parking minimums.

1491
02:33:02,011 --> 02:33:05,573
I am in support of lowering parking minimums to one per unit.

1492
02:33:06,293 --> 02:33:16,479
I would also urge secure bike parking to be mandated as this is one of the biggest obstacles to getting more cycling in a municipality, safe and parking bike parking.

1493
02:33:18,640 --> 02:33:19,100
All right.

1494
02:33:21,401 --> 02:33:21,842
Then from

1495
02:33:26,872 --> 02:33:29,034
Heather Gain, 11 Hicks Ave.

1496
02:33:30,494 --> 02:33:38,860
I'm a Medford homeowner, and I want to write to let you know that I strongly support reducing mandatory parking requirements for new housing, like our neighbors in Somerville.

1497
02:33:39,340 --> 02:33:46,505
While I now have a car, I lived for years in Somerville without one, and I'm excited by the possibilities of Medford's new GLX station.

1498
02:33:46,946 --> 02:33:47,746
Thank you for listening.

1499
02:33:51,629 --> 02:33:55,131
Next, Jessica Farrell, 29 Martin Street,

1500
02:33:56,820 --> 02:33:57,421
in Medford.

1501
02:34:01,424 --> 02:34:08,830
Thank you for considering reducing parking minimums for multifamily housing to one space per dwelling unit as a component of the recodification plan.

1502
02:34:09,431 --> 02:34:20,280
I'm looking forward to future conversations about zoning where we can reduce parking minimums even further, but for now I strongly advocate for reducing parking minimums for multifamily housing to one space per dwelling unit.

1503
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:25,185
which will remove a significant barrier to using our limited space in Medford for housing.

1504
02:34:25,746 --> 02:34:38,181
While my family does own one car, I am somewhat of an outlier among my peers in Medford, many of them do not own cars at all, and I have no need to store a car, all of them do struggle to find affordable housing though and relieving

1505
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:44,062
Some of these laws that make it more difficult to build affordable housing would really help me and many people I know.

1506
02:34:44,643 --> 02:34:47,424
I grew up in a place with very little infrastructure investment.

1507
02:34:47,664 --> 02:34:54,147
I am so thankful to live in a city with all kinds of critical infrastructure, including a world-class public transportation system.

1508
02:34:54,807 --> 02:34:57,909
People who grew up here don't often give the T the credit it deserves.

1509
02:34:58,129 --> 02:35:00,150
We are so lucky to have this infrastructure.

1510
02:35:00,530 --> 02:35:04,492
We should celebrate our access to it and we should build our city to incentivize using it.

1511
02:35:10,542 --> 02:35:15,504
Roberta Cameron 12 North Street says.

1512
02:35:20,466 --> 02:35:29,329
Hi, as you consider the zoning revision that is currently in front of you, I wanted to ask that wherever possible you eliminate or reduce barriers to housing and do not create new ones.

1513
02:35:29,589 --> 02:35:35,411
Please reduce minimum parking standards for affordable housing and do not place new limitations on who can live in homes

1514
02:35:35,928 --> 02:35:43,020
or how people have to be related to each other in order to be considered a family so that they may be allowed to rent a room or an accessory dwelling unit.

1515
02:35:43,540 --> 02:35:49,230
These rules do not serve a public need and may have the effect of discriminating against protected classes.

1516
02:35:50,798 --> 02:35:58,844
I would also ask that you do not place new limitations on home-based businesses which have been operating up until now without creating negative impacts in their neighborhoods.

1517
02:35:59,425 --> 02:36:07,591
We shouldn't burden Medford residents with unnecessary regulations and hurdles that prevent them from making a living or living sustainably in housing that they can afford.

1518
02:36:08,071 --> 02:36:15,577
Our zoning should allow for the diversity of residents' needs that realistically exists, not try to make Medford conform to a suburban ideal.

1519
02:36:20,847 --> 02:36:25,908
and Stephanie and Hans Gunzmeier, 54 Whitney Road.

1520
02:36:31,809 --> 02:36:38,051
Please recommend that parking requirements for multifamily housing be reduced to one parking spot per unit at most.

1521
02:36:38,491 --> 02:36:44,372
Ultimately, we need to work for building and coding that provides a strong support and incentives for car-free living.

1522
02:36:44,592 --> 02:36:48,193
Being without a car and using public transportation needs to become the default.

1523
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:54,093
I don't expect that most people at some distance from T stations will become like my husband and me.

1524
02:36:54,234 --> 02:36:59,077
We have lived in Whitney Road since 2002 and have never owned a car.

1525
02:36:59,518 --> 02:37:11,366
But with the right incentives, new housing developments within a 15-minute walk of Tufts, the new College Ave station, Wellington, or Assembly Square should absolutely be able to attract a majority of residents who are committed to be car-free.

1526
02:37:13,888 --> 02:37:18,872
Please set us along that path by encouraging new development that does not invite more cars into the streets.

1527
02:37:23,194 --> 02:37:26,558
William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, number 1B.

1528
02:37:26,838 --> 02:37:29,661
And I see William has his hand raised.

1529
02:37:30,182 --> 02:37:36,749
So maybe I can read this, but also would invite... That's raised from earlier, so why don't you go ahead and read.

1530
02:37:36,809 --> 02:37:37,831
Okay, thank you.

1531
02:37:37,871 --> 02:37:38,371
Sorry about that.

1532
02:37:43,270 --> 02:37:52,253
I strongly encourage the Community Development Board to recommend that parking minimums for multifamily housing be reduced to one space per dwelling unit as part of the recodification.

1533
02:37:52,273 --> 02:37:55,875
I strongly advocate that we ultimately go much further.

1534
02:37:56,335 --> 02:38:04,018
However, in light of the housing crisis, the existing minimums are glaringly excessive and should be reduced to more reasonable levels without any delay at all.

1535
02:38:09,740 --> 02:38:13,704
Okay, and I have several other comments.

1536
02:38:14,104 --> 02:38:17,988
Those were all the kind of parking related ones.

1537
02:38:18,708 --> 02:38:19,569
Should I continue?

1538
02:38:21,631 --> 02:38:21,911
Yes.

1539
02:38:22,552 --> 02:38:22,932
Okay.

1540
02:38:26,976 --> 02:38:30,699
So, Mary Izzo, or Marie Izzo, 23 Pilgrim Road.

1541
02:38:33,533 --> 02:38:39,838
Please consider any proposal to restrict numbers of people in any home in any district as a violation of civil liberties.

1542
02:38:40,559 --> 02:38:44,882
Do not restrict people's choices but consider including what is already happening as a baseline.

1543
02:38:45,423 --> 02:38:49,206
Clearly affordable housing has not been a focus for our city and it needs to be.

1544
02:38:49,706 --> 02:38:57,232
Innovative solutions to the housing crisis have taken shape out of necessity in all cities across the Commonwealth and in Medford specifically.

1545
02:38:57,615 --> 02:39:00,961
with less than a shameful 10% affordable housing inventory.

1546
02:39:01,743 --> 02:39:06,331
Please take into consideration all possibilities when looking to the proposed ordinances.

1547
02:39:06,952 --> 02:39:08,495
An example would be co-housing.

1548
02:39:08,975 --> 02:39:19,818
Maldon is about to complete a 30 unit co-housing community right on Pleasant Street, which is based on sustainability and minimal square footage and minimal parking per unit.

1549
02:39:20,299 --> 02:39:26,821
It took the group over three years and exorbitant costs to get approval because of archaic and discriminatory zoning practices.

1550
02:39:27,621 --> 02:39:34,023
Also consider and do not exclude models like Airbnb that offer solutions for short-term furnished housing needs

1551
02:39:34,503 --> 02:39:40,185
as well as a means for homeowners to age in place or make extra money when other solutions are simply not available.

1552
02:39:41,165 --> 02:39:47,207
Safety is key, but to restrict choices should never be an alternative to something as basic as a roof over one's head.

1553
02:39:51,648 --> 02:39:56,850
And, okay, and David McKenna to Vine Street.

1554
02:40:03,374 --> 02:40:07,376
The, this is slightly longer comment and he breaks it up by section.

1555
02:40:07,736 --> 02:40:18,061
And I don't know if we're going into sections tonight, I could like interject to those as we do that, or I can just read through it now.

1556
02:40:19,702 --> 02:40:22,523
How long is it, would you be able to paraphrase?

1557
02:40:23,703 --> 02:40:26,825
I can, I could try, yes.

1558
02:40:27,385 --> 02:40:28,566
So section three,

1559
02:40:30,495 --> 02:40:51,060
Dave had some comments about the home-based daycares, large and small, should be allowed by right, as they currently are, as opposed to having the larger ones be by permit, and not to ban lodgers in single-family one and two districts.

1560
02:40:52,220 --> 02:40:56,501
They are currently allowed, and the recodification should not change that.

1561
02:40:57,682 --> 02:40:58,582
For section four,

1562
02:41:02,848 --> 02:41:09,631
The new O2 district allows front yard of zero to 15 feet in part two.

1563
02:41:09,811 --> 02:41:10,512
Oh, I'm sorry.

1564
02:41:14,293 --> 02:41:23,438
The dimensional requirements currently are a burden on attracting new businesses like Life Science.

1565
02:41:26,019 --> 02:41:32,002
He would like to see the front yard requirement change to zero feet for all businesses.

1566
02:41:34,590 --> 02:41:40,912
and residential could also use relief from large yard requirements.

1567
02:41:43,473 --> 02:41:56,558
Section six recommends, so a board member suggested reducing the residential parking requirement to 1.25 for non-single family one residential.

1568
02:41:56,998 --> 02:42:02,740
I recommend making it one space per dwelling for all residential for the zoning for codification recommendations.

1569
02:42:07,977 --> 02:42:16,821
to me, the housing crisis and the climate crisis are more urgent and we need immediate relief from the financial and environmental burden of excess pavement.

1570
02:42:22,203 --> 02:42:32,748
Hopefully we can reduce the parking minimum to below one per unit, but please take the time to start this conversation with the city council now and introduce the idea of one space per unit.

1571
02:42:37,654 --> 02:42:41,115
And yeah, I think those are the main asks.

1572
02:42:44,216 --> 02:42:54,380
And then we have comments from attorney Kathy Desmond, who is probably a familiar face to many of the members here.

1573
02:42:54,400 --> 02:42:58,522
She's actually here.

1574
02:42:59,222 --> 02:43:01,243
I can paraphrase if you like.

1575
02:43:03,504 --> 02:43:04,145
take the floor.

1576
02:43:04,205 --> 02:43:05,246
Amanda doesn't have to.

1577
02:43:05,266 --> 02:43:06,647
Yeah, that'd be great.

1578
02:43:07,187 --> 02:43:10,370
First, in terms of, there's three items essentially that I've found.

1579
02:43:10,390 --> 02:43:14,413
The first is client-based, but it deals with veterinary services.

1580
02:43:15,154 --> 02:43:24,001
And currently those services are permitted under the medical office use, which would be allowed in C1, C2, and the MUZ district.

1581
02:43:25,142 --> 02:43:30,367
Under the new definitions, it's included within the hospital nonprofit definition for some reason.

1582
02:43:31,067 --> 02:43:40,094
And medical services is only limited to personal persons, not animals, and that zone is now in an SF one district.

1583
02:43:40,894 --> 02:43:46,138
And by special permit in other residential districts, but excluded from.

1584
02:43:46,618 --> 02:43:51,281
C1, C2, and the MUC or any commercial districts.

1585
02:43:51,782 --> 02:44:02,289
So it seems kind of counterintuitive and it may have been an oversight in terms of the definitions and perhaps it should have its own definition for veterinary services.

1586
02:44:03,090 --> 02:44:08,313
There's a definition for kennel under agriculture but that you know there are certain

1587
02:44:09,274 --> 02:44:12,757
certain veterinary services don't kennel or board overnight.

1588
02:44:13,778 --> 02:44:20,564
And the building commissioner has always, or has generally construed those to be allowed in the medical offices section.

1589
02:44:20,584 --> 02:44:26,349
So that's just one item in the definitions that appears to be maybe an oversight.

1590
02:44:27,590 --> 02:44:31,513
The second item deals with nonconforming structures and uses.

1591
02:44:32,354 --> 02:44:35,196
And currently under the zoning ordinance under 242,

1592
02:44:36,837 --> 02:44:44,643
There is the right for finding to alter a structure under the proposed change in section.

1593
02:44:44,663 --> 02:45:01,395
I think it's section five section 65.21 that changes in any increase in nonconformity in other than a one or two family now becomes a zoning variance requirement rather than

1594
02:45:02,445 --> 02:45:14,372
what it is now, which will impact three families and some commercial structures where they're just, you know, going up on a sidewall that's already non conforming not creating any difference in the footprint.

1595
02:45:17,455 --> 02:45:19,835
you would be looking at a request for variance.

1596
02:45:20,756 --> 02:45:34,018
And I know there had been a whole discussion originally about third floors and dormers, and this would require, in instances other than single and two families, that you move for a variance on a dormer.

1597
02:45:35,019 --> 02:45:36,799
So the board might wanna look at that.

1598
02:45:36,939 --> 02:45:47,021
I'd suggest if they just took out the language and had left it as a new nonconformity that was being instituted that would require a variance, that would probably be more in line

1599
02:45:47,744 --> 02:45:51,833
with what we currently have in our zoning code and wouldn't be more of a burden.

1600
02:45:53,853 --> 02:46:05,381
And then the last item isn't really probably an item for for this discussion but you know I put it down for thought that the three families are kind of like the ugly stepsister in housing.

1601
02:46:05,941 --> 02:46:09,944
They don't fit in the one and two, and they don't fit in the multi.

1602
02:46:10,524 --> 02:46:17,869
And typically when I have clients come in if you're over 10,000 square feet, they don't want to consider anything below a four unit development.

1603
02:46:18,369 --> 02:46:24,992
But you have lots that are seven, nine, eight, that could probably comfortably fit a three, but there isn't really a category for that.

1604
02:46:25,452 --> 02:46:28,614
They fall in the multi, the four units and above.

1605
02:46:29,414 --> 02:46:41,560
So that might be something going forward that the board would like to consider, is giving them their own category that maybe fits in a general residence or an apartment on a lot that's between the six and the 10.

1606
02:46:43,041 --> 02:46:44,161
And that's all I have.

1607
02:46:45,502 --> 02:46:46,803
Great, thank you for those comments.

1608
02:46:47,403 --> 02:46:47,703
Thank you.

1609
02:46:50,708 --> 02:46:54,989
And there are three more comments that were submitted.

1610
02:46:55,549 --> 02:47:03,691
Two of them are, I will summarize, they, well, I should state their names, I guess, here.

1611
02:47:07,071 --> 02:47:19,634
So Amalia Child, 159 Central Ave, and David Walker, 38 Brookings Street, both express encouragement for one parking spot per unit

1612
02:47:21,211 --> 02:47:25,914
And with an eye to looking towards eliminating parking minimums in the future.

1613
02:47:27,656 --> 02:47:32,899
And then, uh, William Snyder, who I know is also on the call, I believe still, um.

1614
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:35,361
And maybe I'll ask you, William.

1615
02:47:35,702 --> 02:47:42,326
This is a very detailed, um, informative, uh, letter and account here of different

1616
02:47:50,338 --> 02:48:06,247
And these are kind of in a format that would be easy for us, kind of in the vein of what we were talking about before with having folks submit comments to be kind of added to the list that we're putting together for recommendations.

1617
02:48:06,587 --> 02:48:08,188
You don't need to read all of them.

1618
02:48:08,248 --> 02:48:11,970
There's a lot of typos and a lot of just points of clarification.

1619
02:48:11,990 --> 02:48:18,394
But I do want to, since we were talking about parking, the two things I wanted to add to that conversation are,

1620
02:48:19,952 --> 02:48:25,196
Um, based on my experience, I thought it would be a good idea, not only to, um, on the maximum side.

1621
02:48:26,116 --> 02:48:37,524
Require, um, no more than four spaces, but also from an enforceability point of view, um, require that no more than the number of spaces, uh, have cars park.

1622
02:48:38,024 --> 02:48:49,552
So, um, uh, in, in, in the, with the example that, you know, um, people can have, um, what they claimed before spaces, but then park seven cars and pack them in.

1623
02:48:50,622 --> 02:48:53,684
And so I thought that might be an interesting addition and that is in the comments.

1624
02:48:54,165 --> 02:49:03,171
And then finally, it's kind of amusing to read in the definitions, the actual definition of a parking area from the old ordinance that's still in there.

1625
02:49:04,452 --> 02:49:08,095
It is very difficult to parse and it needs to be fixed.

1626
02:49:09,455 --> 02:49:13,658
It's a five comma run on sentence that has rules built into it.

1627
02:49:14,399 --> 02:49:19,022
And it talks about panel vans and it's just, it's impossible to enforce.

1628
02:49:19,082 --> 02:49:19,663
So I just,

1629
02:49:20,647 --> 02:49:29,429
put that in my comment, too, that when we talk about restricting or regulating parking areas, the definition should also be looked at.

1630
02:49:29,849 --> 02:49:31,429
And I think that's all I really need to say.

1631
02:49:31,469 --> 02:49:34,110
I think we've pretty much touched on everything else.

1632
02:49:34,130 --> 02:49:37,190
All right, thank you.

1633
02:49:41,711 --> 02:49:43,892
Is that it for the written comments, Amanda?

1634
02:49:44,552 --> 02:49:44,832
Yes.

1635
02:49:45,752 --> 02:49:46,392
All right, thank you.

1636
02:49:48,713 --> 02:49:49,533
Yes, Stephen.

1637
02:49:53,537 --> 02:49:53,957
Yeah, thank you.

1638
02:49:53,997 --> 02:49:57,520
I just have two others that I'll bring up now.

1639
02:49:57,540 --> 02:50:00,801
We were just totally off what the big topics were tonight.

1640
02:50:01,382 --> 02:50:09,567
But the sign section of the ordinance, there's language in there about lighting, and it refers to prohibited lighting.

1641
02:50:10,427 --> 02:50:15,910
But then the language about the prohibited lighting is probably a little old fashioned.

1642
02:50:16,791 --> 02:50:21,694
And this came up maybe at the city council a year or so ago, where

1643
02:50:23,417 --> 02:50:28,079
uh, businesses were trying to put up, um, video type signs.

1644
02:50:28,980 --> 02:50:37,203
And, um, there wasn't anything in the ordinance, uh, prohibiting them other than if the way you read the, um, the illumination part of it.

1645
02:50:37,664 --> 02:50:40,725
So maybe that section should be clarified a little bit.

1646
02:50:40,745 --> 02:50:51,150
And I think at one point, uh, through the chamber of commerce, I'm a member of the, um, government affairs committee of the chamber, and we drafted some language at the time.

1647
02:50:51,856 --> 02:50:56,660
to clarify it, it wasn't needed, I guess, because the issues were put to rest in other ways.

1648
02:50:57,260 --> 02:51:04,465
But I'd like to submit that along the way for consideration to clarify the lighting section of the sign ordinance.

1649
02:51:05,366 --> 02:51:13,452
And was there much- And I'm sorry, just to be clear, are you saying to allow modern video signs or?

1650
02:51:13,472 --> 02:51:20,277
Well, no, and maybe they're appropriate in certain areas, but we wanted to make sure that they were,

1651
02:51:21,350 --> 02:51:34,757
restricted out of non-conforming commercial entities that are in residential neighborhoods, for instance, and maybe in C1 districts, which is the small, typically the small neighborhood business districts.

1652
02:51:36,457 --> 02:51:49,704
And if they were to be considered that maybe they only be allowed in C2 districts with, you know, Mr. Gav or along the Fellsway where those shopping plazas are, but that they weren't,

1653
02:51:50,773 --> 02:51:55,695
They wouldn't work well in the small districts because they're very distractive.

1654
02:51:56,395 --> 02:52:05,279
It's very hard to keep them from, when you talk about lighting pollution, for instance, or casting light on other sections, it's very hard to do that.

1655
02:52:05,739 --> 02:52:13,102
And particularly in the non-conforming sections where there were commercial businesses in residential neighborhoods.

1656
02:52:13,622 --> 02:52:17,864
So I think we did draft some language for that that we can relook at and submit that.

1657
02:52:19,667 --> 02:52:21,187
Yeah, please, that would be great.

1658
02:52:22,227 --> 02:52:26,268
And then one other item I won't, I'll be done for tonight.

1659
02:52:28,629 --> 02:52:31,909
And I know reducing cars is a big thing.

1660
02:52:32,769 --> 02:52:41,551
One of the issues with, so the setback requirement is 15 feet for a residential structure.

1661
02:52:42,531 --> 02:52:46,872
And what happens is if a garage is built at that 15 foot mark,

1662
02:52:47,698 --> 02:52:50,059
it leaves 15 feet for the driveway.

1663
02:52:50,719 --> 02:53:01,404
And what I notice in a lot of places where there's only a 15 foot driveway is the vehicles end up hanging over the sidewalk, preventing people from being able to traverse the sidewalk.

1664
02:53:02,064 --> 02:53:16,370
So the 15 foot setback might apply to parts of the house where you're not parking vehicles, but when it's a garage attached to a house and you're only allowing 15 feet, you end up with the sidewalk being blocked.

1665
02:53:16,906 --> 02:53:25,609
So it might be some way to address, um, without increasing, having to increase the setback to 18 feet would be somehow to address that.

1666
02:53:25,829 --> 02:53:31,051
Um, there at least be 18 feet, um, between a garage and the sidewalk.

1667
02:53:37,973 --> 02:53:39,894
So it's, uh, just about nine o'clock.

1668
02:53:40,134 --> 02:53:42,935
And I said that we would, uh, finish at nine.

1669
02:53:43,535 --> 02:53:43,896
So I.

1670
02:53:45,983 --> 02:53:48,785
Just want to recap, I think, where things stand.

1671
02:53:48,965 --> 02:53:53,329
We've gotten a lot of great comments, both at last meeting and at this meeting.

1672
02:53:53,990 --> 02:54:10,023
And I think that the next step is for us to try to compile it all into a written list so that we can consider the language and take action on whether or not to include it in our recommendations going forward.

1673
02:54:10,643 --> 02:54:13,886
So I think the task that we have in front of us is

1674
02:54:16,307 --> 02:54:18,067
The planning staff and thank you, Amanda.

1675
02:54:18,087 --> 02:54:20,748
I assume you'll be probably doing most of this work.

1676
02:54:21,028 --> 02:54:25,269
It will be compiling all of these comments into a list.

1677
02:54:25,789 --> 02:54:34,631
And so I encourage the board members as well as members of the public who want to submit further comments to do that as early as possible.

1678
02:54:35,271 --> 02:54:37,972
And Amanda, where should folks send that?

1679
02:54:40,544 --> 02:54:55,928
For members of the public, you should send them to our office email, which I'll type in the chat, but it is ocd at Medford-ma.gov.

1680
02:54:57,048 --> 02:54:59,108
And board members, you can send it directly to me.

1681
02:55:03,689 --> 02:55:06,350
So I think the homework really for

1682
02:55:07,517 --> 02:55:18,199
for you, Amanda, I'm happy to work with you on this, is to try to turn these comments into potentially actionable language for the fifth.

1683
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:23,861
Thank you.

1684
02:55:24,821 --> 02:55:34,863
So that being said, is there a motion on the floor to continue the public hearing to January 5th at 6 p.m.

1685
02:55:40,374 --> 02:55:41,174
Andrew, this is David.

1686
02:55:43,115 --> 02:55:52,097
I'd like to make a motion to continue the public hearing on this matter until January 5th.

1687
02:55:53,398 --> 02:55:53,658
Thank you.

1688
02:55:53,718 --> 02:55:54,438
Is there a second?

1689
02:55:54,938 --> 02:55:55,618
This is Jackie.

1690
02:55:55,658 --> 02:55:56,538
I second the motion.

1691
02:55:57,379 --> 02:55:57,979
Thanks, Jackie.

1692
02:55:59,079 --> 02:55:59,739
Roll call vote.

1693
02:56:00,459 --> 02:56:01,120
Deanna Peabody?

1694
02:56:02,120 --> 02:56:02,320
Aye.

1695
02:56:03,540 --> 02:56:04,341
Jackie Furtado?

1696
02:56:04,921 --> 02:56:05,061
Aye.

1697
02:56:05,761 --> 02:56:06,381
Christy Dowd?

1698
02:56:07,321 --> 02:56:07,441
Aye.

1699
02:56:08,262 --> 02:56:08,942
David Blumberg?

1700
02:56:09,622 --> 02:56:09,702
Aye.

1701
02:56:10,846 --> 02:56:12,887
and I'm an eye as well, so thank you.

1702
02:56:12,947 --> 02:56:19,771
We will basically continue the public hearing until January 5th at 6 p.m.

1703
02:56:20,031 --> 02:56:28,036
and thank you everybody, members of the public, for participating tonight and we encourage you to stay involved and send us your best suggestions.

1704
02:56:28,576 --> 02:56:28,937
Thank you.

1705
02:56:29,737 --> 02:56:32,459
Is there a motion on the floor to

1706
02:56:37,150 --> 02:56:38,331
Andre, I'd like to make a motion.

1707
02:56:38,492 --> 02:56:40,514
This is David to adjourn for the evening.

1708
02:56:40,534 --> 02:56:40,894
Hold on.

1709
02:56:41,294 --> 02:56:41,855
Sorry, guys.

1710
02:56:42,315 --> 02:56:44,377
I was going to say, wait, so soon.

1711
02:56:45,538 --> 02:56:46,760
Hold on.

1712
02:56:47,440 --> 02:56:49,462
Just a quick thing that I wanted to plug.

1713
02:56:50,023 --> 02:56:58,491
We did receive an application from RISE Development for 4054 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1714
02:56:59,373 --> 02:57:00,794
application for site plan review.

1715
02:57:01,234 --> 02:57:03,015
So keep your eyes peeled.

1716
02:57:03,035 --> 02:57:11,779
I will be sending some more scheduling emails, which I know you will love for mid-January to hear that.

1717
02:57:12,700 --> 02:57:28,648
And just a reminder that we did land on the 20th of this month to hear a brief presentation regarding the 24, sorry, 23 Sycamore Ave project that has to do with design.

1718
02:57:31,507 --> 02:57:33,809
Everybody remembers that's the facade issue.

1719
02:57:33,829 --> 02:57:39,473
It wasn't ready at the time, but they've come back to us for our final approval.

1720
02:57:40,954 --> 02:57:42,635
So it should be very short meeting.

1721
02:57:45,097 --> 02:57:46,198
And that's all I've got for you.

1722
02:57:46,978 --> 02:57:47,839
All right, thanks, Amanda.

1723
02:57:47,859 --> 02:57:49,620
Appreciate it.

1724
02:57:50,261 --> 02:57:51,562
David, back over to you again.

1725
02:57:53,823 --> 02:57:55,424
Okay, Andre, this is David.

1726
02:57:55,444 --> 02:57:58,467
I'd like to offer a motion to adjourn for this evening.

1727
02:57:59,567 --> 02:58:00,308
Is there a second?

1728
02:58:03,822 --> 02:58:04,303
It's Jackie.

1729
02:58:04,363 --> 02:58:04,863
I'm second.

1730
02:58:05,825 --> 02:58:06,466
Thanks, Jackie.

1731
02:58:07,307 --> 02:58:08,008
Roll call vote.

1732
02:58:08,048 --> 02:58:08,709
Deanna Peabody.

1733
02:58:11,052 --> 02:58:11,813
Jackie Furtado.

1734
02:58:13,355 --> 02:58:13,495
Aye.

1735
02:58:14,957 --> 02:58:15,538
Kristie Dowd.

1736
02:58:16,619 --> 02:58:16,760
Aye.

1737
02:58:17,561 --> 02:58:18,262
David Blumberg.

1738
02:58:18,983 --> 02:58:19,083
Aye.

1739
02:58:20,278 --> 02:58:20,959
I'm an eye as well.

1740
02:58:21,379 --> 02:58:22,280
So thank you, everybody.

1741
02:58:22,300 --> 02:58:24,501
I appreciate all your time again.

1742
02:58:24,521 --> 02:58:29,686
I know it's been a busy time, but have a wonderful holiday season.

1743
02:58:29,706 --> 02:58:32,127
I hope you all get a few days off before we meet again.

1744
02:58:32,148 --> 02:58:36,891
Well, actually, probably not till we meet again, since it's going to be on the 20th, but maybe after that.

1745
02:58:40,034 --> 02:58:40,934
All right, take care, everyone.

1746
02:58:41,435 --> 02:58:41,975
Thanks, everyone.

1747
02:58:42,015 --> 02:58:42,436
Have a good night.

1748
02:58:42,776 --> 02:58:43,196
Have a good night.
