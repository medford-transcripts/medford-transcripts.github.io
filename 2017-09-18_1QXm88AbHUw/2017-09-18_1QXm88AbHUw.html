    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=322.33s">Your</a>  name and address please. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=330.608s">So</a>  committee members, my name is Annie Wells and I'm here to follow up on the issue of school enrollment from last week regarding kindergarten and first grade for our daughters in a Columbus school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=340.771s">Last</a>  week we were waiting to hear back from a judgment from a hearing on September 6th. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=346.292s">I</a>  have with me the dismissal of the case without prejudice, meaning the judge did not make a decision on where the children should attend school, meaning there is no court order. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=355.294s">No</a>  court order for Mr. Bellison to be concerned he may be in contempt of. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=359.559s">Furthermore,</a>  Mr. Bellison has indicated to the Department of Education that the children are now enrolled and attending North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=365.502s">They</a>  enrolled at both schools prior to Mr. Bellison's decision and may be attending Medford if it were not for his decision to bar enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=374.947s">He</a>  indicated in email correspondence to Cheryl Knowles, the legal parent and guardian, that his hope was that the court would resolve the matter on September 6th and that he would be responsive to information directly from the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=387.949s">A</a>  temporary arrangement was put in place to split transportation so the children wouldn't miss too much school while all of this was being worked out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=396.156s">This</a>  is not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=397.057s">I'm</a>  here to report today that they missed school today because the other parent did not want to transport them to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=405.945s">This</a>  was her day, and if this temporary arrangement was supposed to be working, it didn't work today. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=412.013s">I</a>  know these two parents better than anyone in this room, and although I am biased, I'm very practical and reasonable in my view of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=419.458s">These</a>  parents will, or would have, worked this out in their own way, on their own time, given that it was a fair, if it's a fair playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=428.144s">If</a>  there's no outside interfering party or blocking enrollment, this will be sorted out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=435.86s">Medford</a>  needs to be an option so that they can do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=439.322s">It</a>  would not harm Medford Public Schools, the committee, or anyone else in this room or anyone outside this room if the children are allowed to be enrolled in Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=447.627s">It</a>  is in everyone's best interest that Medford continue to be an option for the children's enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=451.99s">Superintendent.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=457.514s">So</a>  on <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=464.431s">Attorney</a>  for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=466.272s">Knowles</a>  went to court and asked once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=476.66s">No,</a>  the request was for a court order for school.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=482.325s">There's</a>  a piece of paper which I'll provide to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=486.428s">Enroll</a>  to the public schools, it's a second thing, and it was denied again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=492.605s">I</a>  don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=508.231s">But</a>  more importantly, I was able to get consent to enable to speak to Greg Landry, who was the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=522.993s">And</a>  he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover Public Schools as they were in the past.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=529.001s">They're</a>  enrolled in Medford as well prior to barring enrollment.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=531.624s">Well,</a>  enrolled and attending, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=532.986s">They're</a>  attending the North Andover Public Schools and not out of school.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=537.191s">They</a>  are out today.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=540.15s">We're</a>  not going to go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=542.211s">My</a>  answer is that they're enrolled in the North Andover Public Schools.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=545.091s">That</a>  needs to be the parent's choice with all due respect.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=547.132s">Mr.</a>  Belton has the floor right now and then you'll have an opportunity.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=548.852s">Look,</a>  the parents have to work out their arrangement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=551.913s">We</a>  are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=555.033s">They</a>  have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=559.474s">That's</a>  what the court has told them repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=562.015s">Work</a>  it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=563.175s">If</a>  they work it out and Medford is the choice, then they will be <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=567.277s">Enrolled</a>  registered and students in the Medford public schools, but right now the concern was are they getting an education? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=574.223s">They</a>  were in the north end over public schools and principal Landry has confirmed that and I <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=579.862s">I'm</a>  comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=582.944s">By</a>  the way, this has been going on for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=585.626s">This</a>  isn't something that only came about in the last month. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=588.808s">This</a>  has been going on for an extended period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=592.531s">And</a>  so they've got to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=595.193s">Maybe</a>  having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=600.096s">But</a>  from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=604.819s">We've</a>  consulted with our legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=607.901s">We've</a>  gone over this matter multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=609.922s">We've</a>  spoken to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=611.662s">They're</a>  in the North Andover public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=613.643s">If</a>  the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=618.806s">That's</a>  the way to move on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=621.427s">And</a>  if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms, and we'll provide compensatory services.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=626.109s">How</a>  can it be Medford when you said no? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=627.39s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=627.87s">Wells.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=628.11s">Doctor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=628.751s">Doctor</a>  Wells. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=629.411s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=629.751s">If</a>  you'd like to speak.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=634.344s">How</a>  can they work it out if you're barring enrollment? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=637.567s">You're</a>  leaving that, you forced the decision on these two parents and you favored the other party in saying go to North Andover.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=644.532s">Didn't</a>  do anything.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=646.453s">You</a>  did, you barred enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=648.014s">I</a>  have the email here saying you've barred enrollment from Medford.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=653.058s">From</a>  our standpoint, from our standpoint, the court said that Carol Knowles does not have the right <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=662.479s">to</a>  enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=665.98s">If</a>  we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=674.701s">Now,</a>  in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=676.161s">Now,</a>  as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=678.922s">We</a>  consulted with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=680.562s">If</a>  the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=685.243s">But</a>  the state actually asked us, I'm gonna say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=692.233s">because</a>  the parents couldn't come to an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=695.056s">We</a>  declined to do that.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=696.677s">The</a>  case has been closed by the Department of Education because you informed them they're going to North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=701.402s">We</a>  are not in agreement with North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=705.686s">It</a>  needs to be an option for Medford to allow them to, they would have gone to Medford today.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=712.705s">So</a>  we would have had an objection from the other side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=715.586s">Yes,</a>  but that's not yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=717.647s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=717.907s">So</a>  it's not our issue to argue with you one way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=720.108s">Get</a>  together, solve the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=722.148s">Just</a>  say yes, Mr. Belsey. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=722.669s">And</a>  whenever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=724.769s">We</a>  will if you say yes.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=726.31s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=726.57s">It's</a>  not me to say yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=728.531s">It's</a>  for you to solve it with the court.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=730.852s">We</a>  can't if you say no.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=733.133s">Yes,</a>  you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=734.633s">Yes,</a>  you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=735.073s">Because</a>  the court wants you to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=737.397s">If</a>  I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=741.04s">The</a>  court denied it again.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=743.202s">Dismissed</a>  the case, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=744.824s">If</a>  you read it over, it's a request for the court to make an order for any court district, any district, including other ones we would be willing to move to, because Medford has said no to us.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=756.254s">We</a>  have our attorney present, Mr. Greenspan. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=758.176s">Could</a>  you please step forward?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=770.118s">Mayor</a>  and the committee, you asked me after last week's meeting to follow up and get some additional information regarding this matter, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=779.241s">I'm</a>  in receipt of a ruling by the Essex County Probate Court, which came in last week, relative to a motion to establish school enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=798.803s">uh,</a>  which was brought by, uh, Cheryl Knowles in the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=804.906s">Uh,</a>  the motion, uh, stated that, uh, or requested that the court order school enrollment in one of the towns within a reasonable commute to Cheryl's work. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=822.433s">Uh,</a>  she had requested, uh, that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=829.538s">The</a>  court ordered that. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=832.06s">The</a>  court made a decision on September 6, 2017 and denied the request.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=842.927s">Denied</a>  without prejudice the determination of the merits.</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=846.409s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=847.51s">So</a>  the request for temporary relief filed by the plaintiff in this matter <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=855.62s">was</a>  denied by a judge in the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=861.582s">From</a>  my review of the court records, this is the second time the Essex County Probate Court denied the relief to this plaintiff. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=875.646s">The</a>  first one, I believe, was to request an order that they be enrolled in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=884.547s">So</a>  a judge has ruled on this twice, both times not in favor of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=891.773s">Knowles,</a>  and it would be my recommendation that until there's a further order of the court that the Medford Public Schools respect the order of the Essex County Probate Court until either a trial on the merits <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=913.358s">or</a>  any other further rulings of the court.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=916.38s">Can</a>  I ask one question? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=918.642s">At</a>  any point during the probate and future court hearings throughout the divorce or separation, I don't know what transpired previously, was there ever a ruling or an order that they had to go to North Andover?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=933.451s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=933.992s">I</a>  don't believe so, but I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=939.361s">So</a>  this did go to trial, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=942.082s">And</a>  the determination of the trial that was in March was for the parents to decide and to go to mediation, which it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=947.885s">And</a>  as you can see by the motion for the hearing, they were unable to come to an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=951.986s">And</a>  again, like I said, I know these parents well. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=953.847s">They</a>  will and would work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=956.488s">It</a>  was an even playing field, and there was no forced <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=962.602s">Forced</a>  decision to go to a district that is not an option but for March through September and they weren't able to reach a Decision on their own Exactly and the court is not gonna touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=979.929s">So</a>  I don't know why Mr. Belson feels that he is above a judge in making a decision on where they should go Mayor I just</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=990.3s">I</a>  think Mr. Belson has stated that he would welcome the enrollment of these children once this matter is resolved in the Essex County Probate Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1002.903s">Specifically</a>  in May of 2017, the motion was, the request was to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1016.066s">That</a>  was brought in May of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1020.013s">Judge</a>  Ordonez denied that motion that specifically requested that the children be enrolled in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1029.281s">That</a>  was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1031.824s">There</a>  was a additional motion filed on and ruled on again this September, which denied the relief sought by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1043.414s">Knowles.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1044.755s">So</a>  until there is a trial on the merits, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1050.312s">or</a>  any other rulings by the court, I would recommend that these children not be enrolled in Medford until further order of the court.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1063.115s">With</a>  all due respect, Mr. Greenspan, the court has made it clear they are not going to make a decision on school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1070.997s">There's</a>  not gonna be a trial. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1074.018s">They're</a>  done. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1076.638s">They're</a>  not ordering a district.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1080.567s">The</a>  parent in North Andover, is she willing to unenroll them in North Andover to enroll them here?</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1085.411s">They</a>  will work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1087.192s">If</a>  she was unwilling to drive, she was unwilling to drive to Medford to bring them to school today because of the distance and her unwillingness to move and do other, we've offered private school, we've offered in the middle, we've offered to do the transporting and meet in the middle, we've offered many accommodations to her and all she wants is to have them in her district, not have to drive, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1108.247s">and</a>  not be accountable to anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1110.51s">So</a>  she's not really willing to compromise, but if Medfar was an option, I assure you, there would be an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1119.931s">They</a>  worked things out in their own way, and if both schools were an option, she would probably not want to drive to Medford to pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1130.054s">Five</a>  days a week, because they're with us five days a week.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1132.295s">Please</a>  understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1142.739s">It</a>  would be not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1145.54s">The</a>  superintendent wouldn't, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1147.574s">there</a>  would be not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1149.175s">So</a>  clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1155.719s">And</a>  we are not okay with North Andover, but North Andover didn't say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1158.86s">The</a>  only reason they're in North Andover is because they didn't say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1161.222s">So</a>  we're not in agreement with North Andover.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1163.223s">But</a>  they were in North Andover last year, correct?</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1166.165s">No,</a>  kindergarten, she was in pre-kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1168.306s">In</a>  North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1170.127s">So</a>  pre-k she was in Wilmington, and Avery attended kindergarten at Atkinson.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1176.65s">Temporarily</a>  until the trial in March So can you see the I am because they see the imbalance for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1184.013s">Let</a>  me just explain it this way The judge has a statement about not allowing them to enroll in men from the judge makes no statement about not allowing them to enroll in North and over <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1194.95s">The</a>  judge has maybe not made a clean decision that you would like, but he's clearly implied something at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1202.351s">I'm</a>  not going to try and get in the middle of a domestic dispute on this situation, as long as the kids are in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1207.953s">They're</a>  in school.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1211.053s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1213.014s">I</a>  had a similar question to my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1216.514s">So</a>  my own question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1220.861s">If</a>  someone had not petitioned for a specific district, then both parents would be on even still. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1229.046s">But</a>  because one parent petitioned the court for a judgment, that's the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1235.47s">If</a>  the other parent had asked the court to enroll them in North Andover, the judge might have said no, not North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1242.114s">But</a>  that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1244.889s">where,</a>  like, had it not been asked specifically, can we ask, then it would be, we wouldn't have documents.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1251.271s">It</a>  was, can we have a court order?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1253.132s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1253.632s">They</a>  said, parents decide, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1256.973s">Parents</a>  decide where to send their kids all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1260.474s">And</a>  if you don't want to be involved with all due respect, just please unbar their enrollment so that we can work this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1268.036s">I</a>  assure you, it will be fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1269.717s">Whether</a>  it's North End or Medford, we will let you know, but this needs to be a yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1275.649s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1275.829s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1277.891s">First</a>  of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1282.79s">I'm</a>  reading from the documentation that you just provided to us, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1287.412s">And</a>  I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1299.556s">Yes,</a>  they will. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1300.536s">But</a>  on the other hand, I'm reading this, and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1306.778s">in</a>  proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work, and it's currently in certain places. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1314.227s">One</a>  of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1318.512s">However,</a>  it does say that the parent who is in North Andover, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1324.768s">Refuses</a>  to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1331.41s">So</a>  two days a week No, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us that's on the documentation So what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know, we want to we want to understand where you're coming from, but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford and <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1352.142s">then</a>  the parents would come to an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1355.465s">But</a>  here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1364.532s">So</a>  you have to understand this, they have a history of going through the courts for a lot of things, the court, their file is very thick, and they aren't gonna resolve things in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1375.662s">They</a>  resolve things in their own way. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1377.343s">I've</a>  been a witness to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1378.844s">Just,</a>  it, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1381.446s">It</a>  works for them eventually, but you can't decide for them that it's gonna be North Danover because you've given her you've given her a lot of Freedom and now she's going to go and file for having custody during the week and right now they have them five days but it doesn't even say that because it says that there are other cities in towns that the other parent is willing to move to and</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1404.938s">including</a>  Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield and Redding, which is much closer than Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1410.063s">And</a>  again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not gonna move out of there or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1418.971s">So</a>  that's, I mean, it's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1432.343s">So</a>  right now she's got there's no reason for her to work with us because There's a note from Medford.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1436.647s">So</a>  why should she have to give on anything, but you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1443.053s">No,</a>  but what I'm saying is that I'm just going by what you're saying and that is that even if we opened up Medford according to the documentation that you have given us from the court <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1453.202s">that</a>  you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1460.968s">I'm</a>  reading it from the documentation that you provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1463.63s">So</a>  if there's any other, you know.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1467.232s">That's</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1468.513s">That</a>  was just demonstrating that we've made many offers to move to the same district together, private schools, et cetera, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1476.499s">We've</a>  made options. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1477.539s">Right,</a>  and they've refused. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1478.78s">Right,</a>  so now we're just Medford versus North Andover right now.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1482.42s">So</a>  let me ask this, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1486.201s">We're</a>  all trying to solve this, but we have different viewpoints on how we look at it, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1492.704s">Lisa</a>  Greenberg is your attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1495.024s">She's</a>  filed the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1496.745s">If</a>  she thought that we didn't have <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1500.919s">a</a>  solid position, she'd be in our face. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1503.421s">But</a>  she's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1504.381s">You're</a>  coming here.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1505.262s">She</a>  costs $300 an hour, sir.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1507.002s">But</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1508.703s">She's</a>  the legal representative for you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1510.584s">Mia,</a>  I don't call you because you're not taking our calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1513.546s">I'm</a>  not calling, I'm saying sue us.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1514.987s">I'm</a>  sorry?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1515.727s">You're</a>  saying if she sued us.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1517.448s">Well,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1518.329s">Look,</a>  if she's got a position that she thinks she can sustain, then she should be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1523.932s">But</a>  I called the Department of Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1527.493s">And</a>  I sat down with them and I said, tell me what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1530.955s">They</a>  went over it and quite frankly, they sustained our position. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1535.9s">So</a>  believe me, if I had a kid outside that wasn't enrolled, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would tell me to enroll that kid if it was my opportunity to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1547.429s">Believe</a>  me, they would not let me. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1549.631s">We've</a>  been through this many times with Desi. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1552.373s">If</a>  there's a kid out there that needs to be enrolled, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1555.856s">Even</a>  if they're an undocumented immigrant, I'm going to put it that way, they would tell us to enroll them and not check anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1562.365s">So</a>  the fact that they have not taken a position on this thing gives me great concern.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1568.38s">I</a>  did that today because I got the I got a note from Greg Landry who's the principal at Atkinson says they're enrolled Today <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1593.581s">What</a>  about us? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1594.422s">What</a>  about our disagreement with Northlander? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1595.963s">What</a>  about the fact that the kids would be commuting five days a week back and forth? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1599.206s">The</a>  fact that they didn't go to school today because their parent didn't pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1602.229s">An</a>  unreliable parent didn't pick them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1604.451s">What</a>  is your responsibility to us?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1608.349s">I've</a>  got to take some guidance from an impartial group out there, whether it's, it can't be you and it can't be the other person, Nicole Denning. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1617.433s">It's</a>  got to be a decision made by a third party, and I'll be happy to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1622.395s">We</a>  would be more than happy to enroll the children if we had the go ahead, but we don't.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1628.964s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1629.164s">Van</a>  der Kloot, do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1635.788s">The</a>  one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1642.551s">It's</a>  a 50-50 schedule, but as you can see from the email,</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1645.533s">I</a>  think she's asking for something legal from the court system that talks about custody, not an email chain.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1653.615s">That's</a>  going to be here until December. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1655.615s">She's</a>  petitioning to try to get them.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1657.356s">The</a>  one you have in place right now.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1659.336s">We</a>  have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1663.077s">So</a>  a 50-50 schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1664.337s">However,</a>  she switched her work schedule so she works weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1668.338s">The</a>  children are now with us on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1675.84s">So</a>  on Monday and Tuesday, they would be living in North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1681.342s">So</a>  the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1689.325s">Does</a>  it matter? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1696.335s">Cheryl</a>  coaches soccer, both teams, 12 to three, both kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1702.46s">They</a>  have friends in the community, they go to school, they go to park, and the kids say, hey, what class are you in? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1707.524s">And</a>  it's quite troublesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1709.405s">All</a>  of their social activities are here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1712.487s">This</a>  is where they live. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1713.868s">These</a>  parents will work out the school issue and transportation if you just let us do it on our time. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1721.716s">Mr.</a>  Greenspan?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1723.297s">No,</a>  the only thing I can say is that there was a specific request, again in May, requesting to enroll the children in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1735.882s">That</a>  was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1737.502s">The</a>  court has again denied any change in these orders.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1742.044s">The</a>  most current is September, obviously not May.</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1745.065s">Right,</a>  there was an original, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1748.698s">request</a>  in May, and a motion was made in May to specifically ask the court to make an order to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1760.02s">Specifically,</a>  the motion was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1763.821s">There</a>  was another request to modify that in September of 2017, denied again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1771.762s">So</a>  until there is some further clarification or a ruling at trial, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1778.549s">I</a>  would recommend strongly that the committee not enroll or order these children enrolled in Medford until there is further court orders to that effect or an agreement by the parties.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1795.875s">We</a>  can get you an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1796.795s">If</a>  you let us, if you say yes to Medford, we'll get you an agreement.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1799.696s">If</a>  you got an agreement, you'd get yes to Medford.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1802.277s">That's</a>  where the quagmire we're in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1804.718s">They</a>  would have been in Medford today, and if they'd be in Medford Wednesday when we have them, on Thursday and Friday, and she was tired of driving back and forth from North Vanderbilt to Medford, she would give in, and in Medford it would be.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1814.882s">So</a>  let me just say one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1818.843s">My</a>  own gut tells me the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1822.247s">It's</a>  not scientific, but my own gut tells me the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1825.308s">The</a>  reality is, is the court probably is saying one child was in North Andover last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1832.171s">Leave</a>  them there because, quite frankly, they've got some stability there. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1836.678s">The</a>  other child, okay, so they're two together. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1840.76s">And</a>  what we're facing right now, we're facing a situation where this party would like them to be enrolled in Medford, because then you go back to the court and say, guess what, they're in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1851.227s">So</a>  we're gonna play one off against the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1853.248s">The</a>  reality here is that if you told the court, my suggestion, you told the court that Medford is willing, if in fact, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1862.663s">The</a>  court will make a decision, then you've got the same leverage you would have otherwise. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1867.027s">We</a>  are willing to enroll these children if we get a go-ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1869.89s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1870.611s">We're</a>  not against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1872.292s">We</a>  like children. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1873.614s">We</a>  like enrollment.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1874.615s">North</a>  Andover didn't wait for a go-ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1875.836s">And</a>  because you said no, it has to be North Andover. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1878.138s">Do</a>  you get this? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1879.459s">North</a>  Andover didn't need a go-ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1881.201s">We</a>  live in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1882.722s">Why</a>  are you saying no?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1886.946s">We're</a>  at a council, I tell you.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1888.907s">The</a>  council keeps saying the same thing over and over again, which is that no court made an order, and he's saying he doesn't recommend it, but there's no court order saying they can't go to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1897.013s">What</a>  is it?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1898.374s">There's</a>  a court order denying, denying enrollment in the Medford Public School. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1905.219s">I</a>  have the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1908.061s">I</a>  don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1908.722s">I've</a>  read it to myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1910.363s">The</a>  committee has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1911.784s">The</a>  court has denied the order in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1916.367s">Denied</a>  an order. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1917.847s">It's</a>  been revisited again in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1920.648s">They've</a>  denied that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1922.428s">The</a>  superintendent has stated that he is willing to enroll these children. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1929.01s">If</a>  you have an agreement or a court order, either way, if there is an agreement between the parents or a court order modifying <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1940.176s">What's</a>  been and what is in front of us now, the superintendent has stated he's willing to enroll these children in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1949.259s">And</a>  my recommendation, again, is to wait either for a order from the trial on the merits or until there's a reversal of this motion or until there is an agreement.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1963.752s">How</a>  can there be an agreement if Medford says no?</p>

    <p>[Greenspan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1967.337s">Medford</a>  has not said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1969.18s">Medford</a>  is willing to enroll these children if this court order is modified or is there an agreement between the parties.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1982.601s">If</a>  the two parents agree, we will take the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1986.465s">How</a>  can they agree? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1987.246s">If</a>  she has no reason to agree... If she's not willing to drive back and forth to get the kids to school, clearly she... In the meantime, they're out? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1994.073s">I</a>  mean, like when she doesn't want to drive down here?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1996.035s">Point</a>  of information, ma'am?</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1997.655s">Mr.</a>  Harry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=1998.816s">Doctor,</a>  reading through the documents that you presented us, mediation was suggested by the courts. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2004.057s">It</a>  failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2004.457s">What</a>  happened in mediation?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2005.917s">That</a>  it failed.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2006.457s">So</a>  mediation could not reach an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2010.919s">So</a>  Cheryl, my partner, offered to change the schedule for her request if she was willing to open to Medford schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2018.02s">She</a>  didn't want to compromise on anything.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2022.361s">What</a>  did the original custody agreement?</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2024.364s">The</a>  original custody agreement is she has them Monday and Tuesday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2029.49s">Cheryl</a>  had them Monday and Tuesday?</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2030.852s">No,</a>  Nicole.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2031.473s">Nicole,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2032.334s">And</a>  then we have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2036.499s">What,</a>  50-50, five and two? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2037.18s">50-50.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2037.32s">Could</a>  I follow up?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2038.562s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2038.762s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2039.423s">Thank</a>  you, Doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2045.102s">You</a>  had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, the children could go to school Monday through Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2052.067s">Five</a>  days a week.</p>

    <p>[Annie Wells]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2053.548s">Okay,</a>  well five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2055.209s">Is</a>  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, five days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2058.392s">Not</a>  every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2058.952s">Okay,</a>  but they don't go to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2060.013s">Every</a>  week, since March. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2061.033s">But</a>  they don't go to school on Saturday and Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2062.975s">Right,</a>  but there's.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2063.635s">So</a>  what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week, <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2074.751s">And</a>  then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2078.114s">Even</a>  if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that? <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2083.98s">I</a>  mean, I'm really confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/1QXm88AbHUw&t=2085.541s">Do</a>  we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?</p>
