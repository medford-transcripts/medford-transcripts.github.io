18
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:30,618

22
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:42,544
[SPEAKER_55]: Welcome Sebastian.

23
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:44,565
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you so much for being here with us this evening.

24
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:49,027
[SPEAKER_55]: Let the records officially reflect Sebastian's presence please.

33
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:08,394
[SPEAKER_55]: None.

34
00:05:08,414 --> 00:05:08,794
[SPEAKER_81]: Approval.

35
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:09,355
[SPEAKER_55]: None.

36
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,475
[SPEAKER_55]: Approval of payrolls?

37
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:10,856
[SPEAKER_55]: None.

38
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:13,258
[SPEAKER_55]: Report of secretary?

39
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:13,978
[SPEAKER_55]: There is none.

40
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:14,539
[SPEAKER_55]: None.

41
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:15,980
[SPEAKER_55]: Report of committees?

42
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:16,661
[SPEAKER_55]: None.

43
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:18,743
[SPEAKER_55]: Community participation?

44
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,233
[SPEAKER_46]: Your name and address please.

45
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:40,070
[SPEAKER_46]: So committee members, my name is Annie Wells and I'm here to follow up on the issue of school enrollment from last week regarding kindergarten and first grade for our daughters in a Columbus school.

46
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:45,172
[SPEAKER_46]: Last week we were waiting to hear back from a judgment from a hearing on September 6th.

47
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:54,794
[SPEAKER_46]: I have with me the dismissal of the case without prejudice, meaning the judge did not make a decision on where the children should attend school, meaning there is no court order.

48
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:58,415
[SPEAKER_46]: No court order for Mr. Bellison to be concerned he may be in contempt of.

49
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:05,022
[SPEAKER_46]: Furthermore, Mr. Bellison has indicated to the Department of Education that the children are now enrolled and attending North Andover.

50
00:06:05,502 --> 00:06:13,686
[SPEAKER_46]: They enrolled at both schools prior to Mr. Bellison's decision and may be attending Medford if it were not for his decision to bar enrollment.

51
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:26,833
[SPEAKER_46]: He indicated in email correspondence to Cheryl Knowles, the legal parent and guardian, that his hope was that the court would resolve the matter on September 6th and that he would be responsive to information directly from the court.

52
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:34,635
[SPEAKER_46]: A temporary arrangement was put in place to split transportation so the children wouldn't miss too much school while all of this was being worked out.

53
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:36,897
[SPEAKER_46]: This is not working.

54
00:06:37,057 --> 00:06:44,764
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm here to report today that they missed school today because the other parent did not want to transport them to North Andover.

55
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:50,850
[SPEAKER_46]: This was her day, and if this temporary arrangement was supposed to be working, it didn't work today.

56
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:58,898
[SPEAKER_46]: I know these two parents better than anyone in this room, and although I am biased, I'm very practical and reasonable in my view of things.

57
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:07,083
[SPEAKER_46]: These parents will, or would have, worked this out in their own way, on their own time, given that it was a fair, if it's a fair playing field.

58
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:13,307
[SPEAKER_46]: If there's no outside interfering party or blocking enrollment, this will be sorted out.

59
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,482
[SPEAKER_46]: Medford needs to be an option so that they can do this.

60
00:07:19,322 --> 00:07:27,107
[SPEAKER_46]: It would not harm Medford Public Schools, the committee, or anyone else in this room or anyone outside this room if the children are allowed to be enrolled in Medford Public Schools.

61
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:31,970
[SPEAKER_46]: It is in everyone's best interest that Medford continue to be an option for the children's enrollment.

62
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:35,612
[SPEAKER_46]: Superintendent.

63
00:07:37,514 --> 00:07:38,534
[SPEAKER_27]: So on

64
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,252
[SPEAKER_27]: Attorney for Ms.

65
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:56,180
[SPEAKER_27]: Knowles went to court and asked once again, same question, can we enroll in the Medford Public Schools?

66
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,263
[SPEAKER_46]: No, the request was for a court order for school.

67
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:04,867
[SPEAKER_27]: There's a piece of paper which I'll provide to the committee.

68
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:10,031
[SPEAKER_27]: Enroll to the public schools, it's a second thing, and it was denied again.

69
00:08:12,605 --> 00:08:26,251
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't want to get into a question back and forth about what we can and can't do, because I've taken legal guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and I've taken legal guidance from our own council, Howard Greenspan.

70
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:42,297
[SPEAKER_27]: But more importantly, I was able to get consent to enable to speak to Greg Landry, who was the principal of the Atkinson School in North Andover.

71
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:48,520
[SPEAKER_27]: And he has indicated to us that the children are enrolled in North Andover Public Schools as they were in the past.

72
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:51,604
[SPEAKER_46]: They're enrolled in Medford as well prior to barring enrollment.

73
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:52,966
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, enrolled and attending, okay?

74
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:56,290
[SPEAKER_27]: They're attending the North Andover Public Schools and not out of school.

75
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:57,832
[SPEAKER_46]: They are out today.

76
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,910
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not going to go back and forth.

77
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:05,071
[SPEAKER_27]: My answer is that they're enrolled in the North Andover Public Schools.

78
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:07,112
[SPEAKER_46]: That needs to be the parent's choice with all due respect.

79
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,832
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Belton has the floor right now and then you'll have an opportunity.

80
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:11,393
[SPEAKER_27]: Look, the parents have to work out their arrangement.

81
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:14,973
[SPEAKER_27]: We are not going to work out the arrangement between the parents.

82
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:19,414
[SPEAKER_27]: They have to make the decision among themselves where they want the children.

83
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:21,295
[SPEAKER_27]: That's what the court has told them repeatedly.

84
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:22,515
[SPEAKER_27]: Work it out.

85
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:26,636
[SPEAKER_27]: If they work it out and Medford is the choice, then they will be

86
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:33,782
[SPEAKER_27]: Enrolled registered and students in the Medford public schools, but right now the concern was are they getting an education?

87
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:39,047
[SPEAKER_27]: They were in the north end over public schools and principal Landry has confirmed that and I

88
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,924
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm comfortable that they're in the North Andover Public Schools when the parents work it out.

89
00:09:42,944 --> 00:09:45,606
[SPEAKER_27]: By the way, this has been going on for a long time.

90
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,428
[SPEAKER_27]: This isn't something that only came about in the last month.

91
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:51,750
[SPEAKER_27]: This has been going on for an extended period of time.

92
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:54,632
[SPEAKER_27]: And so they've got to work it out.

93
00:09:55,193 --> 00:09:59,395
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe having them in the North Andover Public Schools will bring it to a head.

94
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:04,179
[SPEAKER_27]: But from our standpoint, we've consulted with the Department of Education.

95
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,200
[SPEAKER_27]: We've consulted with our legal counsel.

96
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:09,902
[SPEAKER_27]: We've gone over this matter multiple times.

97
00:10:09,922 --> 00:10:11,262
[SPEAKER_27]: We've spoken to North Andover.

98
00:10:11,662 --> 00:10:13,303
[SPEAKER_27]: They're in the North Andover public schools.

99
00:10:13,643 --> 00:10:18,426
[SPEAKER_27]: If the parents want a different arrangement, work it out, go to the court together, and get it done.

100
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:21,087
[SPEAKER_27]: That's the way to move on the issue.

101
00:10:21,427 --> 00:10:26,089
[SPEAKER_27]: And if it happens to be Medford, we'll welcome these kids with open arms, and we'll provide compensatory services.

102
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,330
[SPEAKER_55]: How can it be Medford when you said no?

103
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:27,490
[SPEAKER_55]: Ms.

104
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,050
[SPEAKER_55]: Wells.

105
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:28,430
[SPEAKER_55]: Doctor.

106
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:29,311
[SPEAKER_55]: Doctor Wells.

107
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:29,731
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

108
00:10:29,751 --> 00:10:33,253
[SPEAKER_55]: If you'd like to speak.

109
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:37,326
[SPEAKER_46]: How can they work it out if you're barring enrollment?

110
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:44,512
[SPEAKER_46]: You're leaving that, you forced the decision on these two parents and you favored the other party in saying go to North Andover.

111
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:46,373
[SPEAKER_27]: Didn't do anything.

112
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:47,974
[SPEAKER_46]: You did, you barred enrollment.

113
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:53,018
[SPEAKER_46]: I have the email here saying you've barred enrollment from Medford.

114
00:10:53,058 --> 00:11:01,405
[SPEAKER_27]: From our standpoint, from our standpoint, the court said that Carol Knowles does not have the right

115
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:05,279
[SPEAKER_27]: to enroll the student in the Medford Public Schools.

116
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:14,141
[SPEAKER_27]: If we were to let the student into the Medford Public Schools, we would be aiding and abetting an individual who has been told not to enroll them in the public schools.

117
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:15,621
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, in Medford.

118
00:11:16,161 --> 00:11:18,462
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, as far as I'm concerned, that's what we've done.

119
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:20,162
[SPEAKER_27]: We consulted with the state.

120
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:24,523
[SPEAKER_27]: If the state had told us you must enroll them, we would have done it.

121
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:30,444
[SPEAKER_27]: But the state actually asked us, I'm gonna say this point blank, the state actually asked us to file a 51A.

122
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,635
[SPEAKER_27]: because the parents couldn't come to an agreement.

123
00:11:35,056 --> 00:11:36,117
[SPEAKER_27]: We declined to do that.

124
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:41,022
[SPEAKER_46]: The case has been closed by the Department of Education because you informed them they're going to North Andover.

125
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,544
[SPEAKER_46]: We are not in agreement with North Andover.

126
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:50,391
[SPEAKER_46]: It needs to be an option for Medford to allow them to, they would have gone to Medford today.

127
00:11:52,705 --> 00:11:55,206
[SPEAKER_27]: So we would have had an objection from the other side as well.

128
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,067
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, but that's not yours.

129
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:57,847
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

130
00:11:57,907 --> 00:12:00,048
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's not our issue to argue with you one way.

131
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,108
[SPEAKER_27]: Get together, solve the issue.

132
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:02,649
[SPEAKER_27]: Just say yes, Mr. Belsey.

133
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:04,749
[SPEAKER_27]: And whenever you solve the issue, the children will be enrolled.

134
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:05,830
[SPEAKER_46]: We will if you say yes.

135
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:06,550
[SPEAKER_27]: No, no.

136
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,871
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not me to say yes.

137
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:10,592
[SPEAKER_27]: It's for you to solve it with the court.

138
00:12:10,852 --> 00:12:12,272
[SPEAKER_46]: We can't if you say no.

139
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:13,613
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, you can.

140
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:15,053
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, you can.

141
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:16,574
[SPEAKER_27]: Because the court wants you to work it out.

142
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:21,020
[SPEAKER_27]: If I look at this document, this is the last one that came through, look over the card.

143
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,342
[SPEAKER_27]: The court denied it again.

144
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,464
[SPEAKER_46]: Dismissed the case, sir.

145
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:35,033
[SPEAKER_46]: If you read it over, it's a request for the court to make an order for any court district, any district, including other ones we would be willing to move to, because Medford has said no to us.

146
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,156
[SPEAKER_55]: We have our attorney present, Mr. Greenspan.

147
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:39,237
[SPEAKER_55]: Could you please step forward?

148
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:58,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor and the committee, you asked me after last week's meeting to follow up and get some additional information regarding this matter, which I did.

149
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:17,667
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm in receipt of a ruling by the Essex County Probate Court, which came in last week, relative to a motion to establish school enrollment.

150
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:23,725
[SPEAKER_18]: uh, which was brought by, uh, Cheryl Knowles in the Essex County Probate Court.

151
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:40,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, the motion, uh, stated that, uh, or requested that the court order school enrollment in one of the towns within a reasonable commute to Cheryl's work.

152
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:47,895
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, she had requested, uh, that, uh,

153
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,639
[SPEAKER_18]: The court ordered that.

154
00:13:52,060 --> 00:14:01,206
[SPEAKER_18]: The court made a decision on September 6, 2017 and denied the request.

155
00:14:02,927 --> 00:14:06,209
[SPEAKER_55]: Denied without prejudice the determination of the merits.

156
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:06,869
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

157
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:14,815
[SPEAKER_18]: So the request for temporary relief filed by the plaintiff in this matter

158
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,421
[SPEAKER_18]: was denied by a judge in the Essex County Probate Court.

159
00:14:21,582 --> 00:14:34,565
[SPEAKER_18]: From my review of the court records, this is the second time the Essex County Probate Court denied the relief to this plaintiff.

160
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:43,768
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one, I believe, was to request an order that they be enrolled in Medford.

161
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:51,733
[SPEAKER_18]: So a judge has ruled on this twice, both times not in favor of Ms.

162
00:14:51,773 --> 00:15:12,369
[SPEAKER_18]: Knowles, and it would be my recommendation that until there's a further order of the court that the Medford Public Schools respect the order of the Essex County Probate Court until either a trial on the merits

163
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:15,239
[SPEAKER_18]: or any other further rulings of the court.

164
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,501
[SPEAKER_55]: Can I ask one question?

165
00:15:18,642 --> 00:15:31,430
[SPEAKER_55]: At any point during the probate and future court hearings throughout the divorce or separation, I don't know what transpired previously, was there ever a ruling or an order that they had to go to North Andover?

166
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:33,972
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

167
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:35,753
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't believe so, but I don't know.

168
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:41,202
[SPEAKER_46]: So this did go to trial, Mayor.

169
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:47,825
[SPEAKER_46]: And the determination of the trial that was in March was for the parents to decide and to go to mediation, which it did.

170
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:51,606
[SPEAKER_46]: And as you can see by the motion for the hearing, they were unable to come to an agreement.

171
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:53,827
[SPEAKER_46]: And again, like I said, I know these parents well.

172
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:55,808
[SPEAKER_46]: They will and would work it out.

173
00:15:56,488 --> 00:16:00,150
[SPEAKER_46]: It was an even playing field, and there was no forced

174
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:19,889
[SPEAKER_46]: Forced decision to go to a district that is not an option but for March through September and they weren't able to reach a Decision on their own Exactly and the court is not gonna touch it.

175
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:28,612
[SPEAKER_46]: So I don't know why Mr. Belson feels that he is above a judge in making a decision on where they should go Mayor I just

176
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:42,623
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Mr. Belson has stated that he would welcome the enrollment of these children once this matter is resolved in the Essex County Probate Court.

177
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:55,486
[SPEAKER_18]: Specifically in May of 2017, the motion was, the request was to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools specifically.

178
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:57,447
[SPEAKER_18]: That was brought in May of 2017.

179
00:17:00,013 --> 00:17:08,821
[SPEAKER_18]: Judge Ordonez denied that motion that specifically requested that the children be enrolled in Medford.

180
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:10,462
[SPEAKER_18]: That was denied.

181
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:23,374
[SPEAKER_18]: There was a additional motion filed on and ruled on again this September, which denied the relief sought by Ms.

182
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:23,814
[SPEAKER_18]: Knowles.

183
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:27,678
[SPEAKER_18]: So until there is a trial on the merits,

184
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:42,195
[SPEAKER_18]: or any other rulings by the court, I would recommend that these children not be enrolled in Medford until further order of the court.

185
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:50,697
[SPEAKER_46]: With all due respect, Mr. Greenspan, the court has made it clear they are not going to make a decision on school district.

186
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:52,137
[SPEAKER_46]: There's not gonna be a trial.

187
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:55,038
[SPEAKER_46]: They're done.

188
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:58,119
[SPEAKER_46]: They're not ordering a district.

189
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:05,391
[SPEAKER_57]: The parent in North Andover, is she willing to unenroll them in North Andover to enroll them here?

190
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:07,132
[SPEAKER_46]: They will work it out.

191
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:27,727
[SPEAKER_46]: If she was unwilling to drive, she was unwilling to drive to Medford to bring them to school today because of the distance and her unwillingness to move and do other, we've offered private school, we've offered in the middle, we've offered to do the transporting and meet in the middle, we've offered many accommodations to her and all she wants is to have them in her district, not have to drive,

192
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:30,450
[SPEAKER_46]: and not be accountable to anything.

193
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:36,936
[SPEAKER_46]: So she's not really willing to compromise, but if Medfar was an option, I assure you, there would be an agreement.

194
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:49,814
[SPEAKER_46]: They worked things out in their own way, and if both schools were an option, she would probably not want to drive to Medford to pick them up.

195
00:18:50,054 --> 00:18:51,915
[SPEAKER_46]: Five days a week, because they're with us five days a week.

196
00:18:52,295 --> 00:19:01,358
[SPEAKER_41]: Please understand from our point of view how confusing this is, because if in fact the other parent was just willing for them to come to Medford, we'd have no issue.

197
00:19:02,739 --> 00:19:03,859
[SPEAKER_41]: It would be not an issue.

198
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,440
[SPEAKER_41]: The superintendent wouldn't,

199
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:08,615
[SPEAKER_41]: there would be not an issue.

200
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:15,699
[SPEAKER_41]: So clearly, there is an issue, because the other parent does not want them to come to Medford, and they've already been in Andover.

201
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,540
[SPEAKER_46]: And we are not okay with North Andover, but North Andover didn't say no.

202
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,182
[SPEAKER_46]: The only reason they're in North Andover is because they didn't say no.

203
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:23,203
[SPEAKER_46]: So we're not in agreement with North Andover.

204
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:26,145
[SPEAKER_41]: But they were in North Andover last year, correct?

205
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,986
[SPEAKER_46]: No, kindergarten, she was in pre-kindergarten.

206
00:19:28,306 --> 00:19:29,226
[SPEAKER_46]: In North Andover.

207
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:35,390
[SPEAKER_46]: So pre-k she was in Wilmington, and Avery attended kindergarten at Atkinson.

208
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:43,992
[SPEAKER_27]: Temporarily until the trial in March So can you see the I am because they see the imbalance for a minute.

209
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:54,056
[SPEAKER_27]: Let me just explain it this way The judge has a statement about not allowing them to enroll in men from the judge makes no statement about not allowing them to enroll in North and over

210
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:01,711
[SPEAKER_27]: The judge has maybe not made a clean decision that you would like, but he's clearly implied something at this point in time.

211
00:20:02,351 --> 00:20:07,553
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm not going to try and get in the middle of a domestic dispute on this situation, as long as the kids are in school.

212
00:20:07,953 --> 00:20:08,573
[SPEAKER_27]: They're in school.

213
00:20:11,053 --> 00:20:11,913
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Benedetto?

214
00:20:13,014 --> 00:20:16,234
[SPEAKER_50]: I had a similar question to my colleague.

215
00:20:16,514 --> 00:20:19,395
[SPEAKER_50]: So my own question is,

216
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:29,026
[SPEAKER_50]: If someone had not petitioned for a specific district, then both parents would be on even still.

217
00:20:29,046 --> 00:20:35,190
[SPEAKER_50]: But because one parent petitioned the court for a judgment, that's the difference.

218
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:42,074
[SPEAKER_50]: If the other parent had asked the court to enroll them in North Andover, the judge might have said no, not North Andover.

219
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:43,154
[SPEAKER_50]: But that didn't happen.

220
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:51,211
[SPEAKER_50]: where, like, had it not been asked specifically, can we ask, then it would be, we wouldn't have documents.

221
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:52,711
[SPEAKER_46]: It was, can we have a court order?

222
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:53,352
[SPEAKER_50]: Right.

223
00:20:53,632 --> 00:20:56,693
[SPEAKER_46]: They said, parents decide, right?

224
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:59,474
[SPEAKER_46]: Parents decide where to send their kids all the time.

225
00:21:00,474 --> 00:21:07,356
[SPEAKER_46]: And if you don't want to be involved with all due respect, just please unbar their enrollment so that we can work this out.

226
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:09,697
[SPEAKER_46]: I assure you, it will be fine.

227
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:13,138
[SPEAKER_46]: Whether it's North End or Medford, we will let you know, but this needs to be a yes.

228
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:15,809
[SPEAKER_46]: Ms.

229
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:16,149
[SPEAKER_54]: Cunha.

230
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:22,334
[SPEAKER_54]: First of all, again, our hearts go out to the situation, but I'm also confused.

231
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,292
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm reading from the documentation that you just provided to us, okay?

232
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:39,416
[SPEAKER_54]: And I'm not gonna say names, but I'm reading and it says, you keep on saying that if the superintendent says, okay, my fit is fine, they'll work it out.

233
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:40,056
[SPEAKER_54]: Yes, they will.

234
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:45,878
[SPEAKER_54]: But on the other hand, I'm reading this, and when you come to number six, it says a parent had reasonable,

235
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:53,706
[SPEAKER_54]: in proposing numerous towns closest to the other parents' work, and it's currently in certain places.

236
00:21:54,227 --> 00:21:58,332
[SPEAKER_54]: One of the parties, the children have gone to daycare in Wilmington, as you just said.

237
00:21:58,512 --> 00:22:03,258
[SPEAKER_54]: However, it does say that the parent who is in North Andover,

238
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:10,730
[SPEAKER_54]: Refuses to leave North the end over and insists the children be involved in school there.

239
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:31,295
[SPEAKER_54]: So two days a week No, but it doesn't say that I'm just going by what you're telling us that's on the documentation So what I guess my thing is is that you're standing here telling us that you know, we want to we want to understand where you're coming from, but you're saying that if we take this this bar or term that you're using off of Medford and

240
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,884
[SPEAKER_54]: then the parents would come to an agreement.

241
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:43,712
[SPEAKER_54]: But here in the documentation from the court that you just provided says that that person, no matter what you provide, is going to refuse.

242
00:22:44,532 --> 00:22:55,521
[SPEAKER_46]: So you have to understand this, they have a history of going through the courts for a lot of things, the court, their file is very thick, and they aren't gonna resolve things in court.

243
00:22:55,662 --> 00:22:56,943
[SPEAKER_46]: They resolve things in their own way.

244
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,284
[SPEAKER_46]: I've been a witness to this.

245
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:00,005
[SPEAKER_46]: Just, it,

246
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:24,260
[SPEAKER_46]: It works for them eventually, but you can't decide for them that it's gonna be North Danover because you've given her you've given her a lot of Freedom and now she's going to go and file for having custody during the week and right now they have them five days but it doesn't even say that because it says that there are other cities in towns that the other parent is willing to move to and

247
00:23:24,938 --> 00:23:29,582
[SPEAKER_54]: including Wilmington, North Redding, Wakefield and Redding, which is much closer than Medford.

248
00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:38,591
[SPEAKER_54]: And again, you still have the other party who says it doesn't really matter because they're not gonna move out of there or they're not willing to bring the children enrolled in those cities.

249
00:23:38,971 --> 00:23:50,061
[SPEAKER_54]: So that's, I mean, it's confusing to us because you're saying, well, if they didn't have the rule or the documentation or going to trial, then they'll come to their own term.

250
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:56,627
[SPEAKER_46]: So right now she's got there's no reason for her to work with us because There's a note from Medford.

251
00:23:56,647 --> 00:24:02,633
[SPEAKER_54]: So why should she have to give on anything, but you don't have a note from Wilmington or North Reading?

252
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:12,341
[SPEAKER_54]: No, but what I'm saying is that I'm just going by what you're saying and that is that even if we opened up Medford according to the documentation that you have given us from the court

253
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:20,527
[SPEAKER_54]: that you provided, it says that the other party refuses to leave North Andover and insists the children be enrolled in school there.

254
00:24:20,968 --> 00:24:23,189
[SPEAKER_54]: I'm reading it from the documentation that you provided.

255
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,832
[SPEAKER_54]: So if there's any other, you know.

256
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:28,493
[SPEAKER_46]: That's the motion.

257
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:36,479
[SPEAKER_46]: That was just demonstrating that we've made many offers to move to the same district together, private schools, et cetera, et cetera.

258
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:37,259
[SPEAKER_46]: We've made options.

259
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:38,560
[SPEAKER_46]: Right, and they've refused.

260
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,822
[SPEAKER_46]: Right, so now we're just Medford versus North Andover right now.

261
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,161
[SPEAKER_27]: So let me ask this, okay?

262
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:51,103
[SPEAKER_27]: We're all trying to solve this, but we have different viewpoints on how we look at it, okay?

263
00:24:52,704 --> 00:24:54,024
[SPEAKER_27]: Lisa Greenberg is your attorney.

264
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:56,105
[SPEAKER_27]: She's filed the motion.

265
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,386
[SPEAKER_27]: If she thought that we didn't have

266
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:02,540
[SPEAKER_27]: a solid position, she'd be in our face.

267
00:25:03,421 --> 00:25:03,961
[SPEAKER_27]: But she's not.

268
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:05,222
[SPEAKER_27]: You're coming here.

269
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:06,962
[SPEAKER_46]: She costs $300 an hour, sir.

270
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:08,463
[SPEAKER_27]: But you know what?

271
00:25:08,703 --> 00:25:10,564
[SPEAKER_27]: She's the legal representative for you.

272
00:25:10,584 --> 00:25:13,526
[SPEAKER_55]: Mia, I don't call you because you're not taking our calls.

273
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,967
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm not calling, I'm saying sue us.

274
00:25:14,987 --> 00:25:15,707
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm sorry?

275
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,388
[SPEAKER_55]: You're saying if she sued us.

276
00:25:17,448 --> 00:25:17,848
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, no.

277
00:25:18,329 --> 00:25:23,851
[SPEAKER_27]: Look, if she's got a position that she thinks she can sustain, then she should be here.

278
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:26,533
[SPEAKER_27]: But I called the Department of Education.

279
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:30,015
[SPEAKER_27]: And I sat down with them and I said, tell me what to do.

280
00:25:30,955 --> 00:25:35,339
[SPEAKER_27]: They went over it and quite frankly, they sustained our position.

281
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:47,029
[SPEAKER_27]: So believe me, if I had a kid outside that wasn't enrolled, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education would tell me to enroll that kid if it was my opportunity to do so.

282
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:48,850
[SPEAKER_27]: Believe me, they would not let me.

283
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,993
[SPEAKER_27]: We've been through this many times with Desi.

284
00:25:52,373 --> 00:25:55,156
[SPEAKER_27]: If there's a kid out there that needs to be enrolled,

285
00:25:55,856 --> 00:26:01,624
[SPEAKER_27]: Even if they're an undocumented immigrant, I'm going to put it that way, they would tell us to enroll them and not check anything else.

286
00:26:02,365 --> 00:26:06,150
[SPEAKER_27]: So the fact that they have not taken a position on this thing gives me great concern.

287
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:15,246
[SPEAKER_46]: I did that today because I got the I got a note from Greg Landry who's the principal at Atkinson says they're enrolled Today

288
00:26:33,581 --> 00:26:34,322
[SPEAKER_46]: What about us?

289
00:26:34,422 --> 00:26:35,943
[SPEAKER_46]: What about our disagreement with Northlander?

290
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:39,186
[SPEAKER_46]: What about the fact that the kids would be commuting five days a week back and forth?

291
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:42,209
[SPEAKER_46]: The fact that they didn't go to school today because their parent didn't pick them up.

292
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:43,550
[SPEAKER_46]: An unreliable parent didn't pick them up.

293
00:26:44,451 --> 00:26:46,113
[SPEAKER_46]: What is your responsibility to us?

294
00:26:48,349 --> 00:26:57,032
[SPEAKER_27]: I've got to take some guidance from an impartial group out there, whether it's, it can't be you and it can't be the other person, Nicole Denning.

295
00:26:57,433 --> 00:27:02,335
[SPEAKER_27]: It's got to be a decision made by a third party, and I'll be happy to do it.

296
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:07,857
[SPEAKER_27]: We would be more than happy to enroll the children if we had the go ahead, but we don't.

297
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:09,144
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

298
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:15,548
[SPEAKER_41]: Van der Kloot, do you have any paper or court order on your custody arrangements?

299
00:27:15,788 --> 00:27:22,531
[SPEAKER_41]: The one thing we've never seen is what your custom custody order is, which says that the children are with you Monday through Friday.

300
00:27:22,551 --> 00:27:24,993
[SPEAKER_46]: It's a 50-50 schedule, but as you can see from the email,

301
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:33,595
[SPEAKER_55]: I think she's asking for something legal from the court system that talks about custody, not an email chain.

302
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:35,595
[SPEAKER_46]: That's going to be here until December.

303
00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:37,316
[SPEAKER_46]: She's petitioning to try to get them.

304
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,016
[SPEAKER_55]: The one you have in place right now.

305
00:27:39,336 --> 00:27:42,757
[SPEAKER_46]: We have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

306
00:27:43,077 --> 00:27:44,117
[SPEAKER_46]: So a 50-50 schedule.

307
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:47,898
[SPEAKER_46]: However, she switched her work schedule so she works weekends.

308
00:27:48,338 --> 00:27:51,839
[SPEAKER_46]: The children are now with us on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

309
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,302
[SPEAKER_41]: So on Monday and Tuesday, they would be living in North Andover.

310
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:09,145
[SPEAKER_41]: So the problem that we have is they are not with us sleeping in Medford the five school days.

311
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:09,785
[SPEAKER_46]: Does it matter?

312
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:21,879
[SPEAKER_46]: Cheryl coaches soccer, both teams, 12 to three, both kids.

313
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,183
[SPEAKER_46]: They have friends in the community, they go to school, they go to park, and the kids say, hey, what class are you in?

314
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:29,005
[SPEAKER_46]: And it's quite troublesome.

315
00:28:29,405 --> 00:28:32,467
[SPEAKER_46]: All of their social activities are here in Medford.

316
00:28:32,487 --> 00:28:33,308
[SPEAKER_46]: This is where they live.

317
00:28:33,868 --> 00:28:38,412
[SPEAKER_46]: These parents will work out the school issue and transportation if you just let us do it on our time.

318
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:42,777
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Greenspan?

319
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:55,501
[SPEAKER_18]: No, the only thing I can say is that there was a specific request, again in May, requesting to enroll the children in Medford.

320
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:56,842
[SPEAKER_18]: That was denied.

321
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,783
[SPEAKER_18]: The court has again denied any change in these orders.

322
00:29:02,044 --> 00:29:05,005
[SPEAKER_46]: The most current is September, obviously not May.

323
00:29:05,065 --> 00:29:07,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Right, there was an original,

324
00:29:08,698 --> 00:29:18,980
[SPEAKER_18]: request in May, and a motion was made in May to specifically ask the court to make an order to enroll the children in the Medford Public Schools.

325
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Specifically, the motion was denied.

326
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:30,802
[SPEAKER_18]: There was another request to modify that in September of 2017, denied again.

327
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:36,563
[SPEAKER_18]: So until there is some further clarification or a ruling at trial,

328
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:55,128
[SPEAKER_18]: I would recommend strongly that the committee not enroll or order these children enrolled in Medford until there is further court orders to that effect or an agreement by the parties.

329
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:56,715
[SPEAKER_46]: We can get you an agreement.

330
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,276
[SPEAKER_46]: If you let us, if you say yes to Medford, we'll get you an agreement.

331
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:02,257
[SPEAKER_55]: If you got an agreement, you'd get yes to Medford.

332
00:30:02,277 --> 00:30:04,678
[SPEAKER_46]: That's where the quagmire we're in right now.

333
00:30:04,718 --> 00:30:14,862
[SPEAKER_46]: They would have been in Medford today, and if they'd be in Medford Wednesday when we have them, on Thursday and Friday, and she was tired of driving back and forth from North Vanderbilt to Medford, she would give in, and in Medford it would be.

334
00:30:14,882 --> 00:30:17,503
[SPEAKER_27]: So let me just say one more thing.

335
00:30:18,843 --> 00:30:21,124
[SPEAKER_27]: My own gut tells me the following.

336
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:24,668
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not scientific, but my own gut tells me the following.

337
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:31,531
[SPEAKER_27]: The reality is, is the court probably is saying one child was in North Andover last year.

338
00:30:32,171 --> 00:30:35,833
[SPEAKER_27]: Leave them there because, quite frankly, they've got some stability there.

339
00:30:36,678 --> 00:30:40,200
[SPEAKER_27]: The other child, okay, so they're two together.

340
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:50,606
[SPEAKER_27]: And what we're facing right now, we're facing a situation where this party would like them to be enrolled in Medford, because then you go back to the court and say, guess what, they're in Medford.

341
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:52,787
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're gonna play one off against the other.

342
00:30:53,248 --> 00:31:01,773
[SPEAKER_27]: The reality here is that if you told the court, my suggestion, you told the court that Medford is willing, if in fact,

343
00:31:02,663 --> 00:31:06,647
[SPEAKER_27]: The court will make a decision, then you've got the same leverage you would have otherwise.

344
00:31:07,027 --> 00:31:09,850
[SPEAKER_27]: We are willing to enroll these children if we get a go-ahead.

345
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,330
[SPEAKER_27]: That's all.

346
00:31:10,611 --> 00:31:11,452
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not against it.

347
00:31:12,292 --> 00:31:13,594
[SPEAKER_27]: We like children.

348
00:31:13,614 --> 00:31:14,334
[SPEAKER_27]: We like enrollment.

349
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:15,816
[SPEAKER_46]: North Andover didn't wait for a go-ahead.

350
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:17,838
[SPEAKER_46]: And because you said no, it has to be North Andover.

351
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:18,779
[SPEAKER_46]: Do you get this?

352
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:20,901
[SPEAKER_46]: North Andover didn't need a go-ahead.

353
00:31:21,201 --> 00:31:22,342
[SPEAKER_46]: We live in the district.

354
00:31:22,722 --> 00:31:24,004
[SPEAKER_46]: Why are you saying no?

355
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:28,867
[SPEAKER_27]: We're at a council, I tell you.

356
00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:35,973
[SPEAKER_46]: The council keeps saying the same thing over and over again, which is that no court made an order, and he's saying he doesn't recommend it, but there's no court order saying they can't go to Medford.

357
00:31:37,013 --> 00:31:37,454
[SPEAKER_46]: What is it?

358
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:44,819
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a court order denying, denying enrollment in the Medford Public School.

359
00:31:45,219 --> 00:31:46,420
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the order.

360
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,501
Please read it to us.

361
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:48,622
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't have to.

362
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:49,903
[SPEAKER_18]: I've read it to myself.

363
00:31:50,363 --> 00:31:51,424
[SPEAKER_18]: The committee has it.

364
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:55,107
[SPEAKER_18]: The court has denied the order in May.

365
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:57,467
[SPEAKER_18]: Denied an order.

366
00:31:57,847 --> 00:32:00,128
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been revisited again in September.

367
00:32:00,648 --> 00:32:02,148
[SPEAKER_18]: They've denied that again.

368
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:08,390
[SPEAKER_18]: The superintendent has stated that he is willing to enroll these children.

369
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:19,372
[SPEAKER_18]: If you have an agreement or a court order, either way, if there is an agreement between the parents or a court order modifying

370
00:32:20,176 --> 00:32:28,679
[SPEAKER_18]: What's been and what is in front of us now, the superintendent has stated he's willing to enroll these children in the Medford Public Schools.

371
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:43,024
[SPEAKER_18]: And my recommendation, again, is to wait either for a order from the trial on the merits or until there's a reversal of this motion or until there is an agreement.

372
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:47,317
[SPEAKER_46]: How can there be an agreement if Medford says no?

373
00:32:47,337 --> 00:32:48,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford has not said no.

374
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:57,953
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford is willing to enroll these children if this court order is modified or is there an agreement between the parties.

375
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:05,524
[SPEAKER_46]: If the two parents agree, we will take the children.

376
00:33:06,465 --> 00:33:07,166
[SPEAKER_46]: How can they agree?

377
00:33:07,246 --> 00:33:13,152
[SPEAKER_46]: If she has no reason to agree... If she's not willing to drive back and forth to get the kids to school, clearly she... In the meantime, they're out?

378
00:33:14,073 --> 00:33:15,675
[SPEAKER_46]: I mean, like when she doesn't want to drive down here?

379
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,035
[SPEAKER_24]: Point of information, ma'am?

380
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:18,216
[SPEAKER_46]: Mr. Harry.

381
00:33:18,816 --> 00:33:24,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Doctor, reading through the documents that you presented us, mediation was suggested by the courts.

382
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:24,417
[SPEAKER_24]: It failed.

383
00:33:24,457 --> 00:33:25,597
[SPEAKER_24]: What happened in mediation?

384
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:26,437
[SPEAKER_55]: That it failed.

385
00:33:26,457 --> 00:33:30,738
[SPEAKER_46]: So mediation could not reach an agreement.

386
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,220
[SPEAKER_46]: So Cheryl, my partner, offered to change the schedule for her request if she was willing to open to Medford schools.

387
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,161
[SPEAKER_46]: She didn't want to compromise on anything.

388
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,124
[SPEAKER_24]: What did the original custody agreement?

389
00:33:44,364 --> 00:33:49,210
[SPEAKER_46]: The original custody agreement is she has them Monday and Tuesday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

390
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,632
[SPEAKER_24]: Cheryl had them Monday and Tuesday?

391
00:33:50,852 --> 00:33:51,453
[SPEAKER_46]: No, Nicole.

392
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:52,214
[SPEAKER_24]: Nicole, okay.

393
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:56,479
[SPEAKER_46]: And then we have them Wednesday, Thursday, every other Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

394
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:57,160
[SPEAKER_46]: What, 50-50, five and two?

395
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,280
[SPEAKER_46]: 50-50.

396
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,422
[SPEAKER_46]: Could I follow up?

397
00:33:58,562 --> 00:33:58,742
[SPEAKER_54]: Ms.

398
00:33:58,762 --> 00:33:59,403
[SPEAKER_54]: Cunha.

399
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:00,725
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you, Doctor.

400
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:12,027
[SPEAKER_54]: You had said to me, I know personally, you had said to me that you had the Monday through Friday, the children could go to school Monday through Friday.

401
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:12,707
[SPEAKER_54]: Five days a week.

402
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:14,829
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, well five days a week.

403
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:18,312
[SPEAKER_46]: Is Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, five days a week.

404
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:18,912
[SPEAKER_46]: Not every week.

405
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:19,973
[SPEAKER_46]: Okay, but they don't go to school.

406
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:20,993
[SPEAKER_46]: Every week, since March.

407
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,755
[SPEAKER_46]: But they don't go to school on Saturday and Sunday.

408
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:23,575
[SPEAKER_46]: Right, but there's.

409
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:34,183
[SPEAKER_54]: So what I'm trying to find out, I'm just trying to find out, if they have them on Monday and Tuesday, and you have them every other week,

410
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:36,833
[SPEAKER_54]: And then you have a Monday, Thursday, and Friday.

411
00:34:38,114 --> 00:34:43,960
[SPEAKER_54]: Even if we said yes, and the other parent doesn't want to bring them down, so how are we going to work that?

412
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,201
[SPEAKER_54]: I mean, I'm really confused.

413
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:49,465
[SPEAKER_54]: Do we not put the children in school for two days out of the week and let them go to another district?

414
00:34:50,833 --> 00:35:00,120
[SPEAKER_46]: I assure you, if they were in Medford Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and North Ender would not allow them to go to school Monday and Tuesdays only, they would say, hey, your kids are missing too much school.

415
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,080
[SPEAKER_46]: And guess what?

416
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:02,642
[SPEAKER_46]: Three days out of the week is more than two.

417
00:35:02,662 --> 00:35:04,083
[SPEAKER_46]: They would be going to Medford.

418
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:04,923
[SPEAKER_46]: Three days.

419
00:35:06,184 --> 00:35:09,427
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, no, five, because she doesn't want to transport on Mondays, apparently, either.

420
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:10,527
[SPEAKER_46]: So four days.

421
00:35:11,288 --> 00:35:16,672
[SPEAKER_54]: But if she doesn't want to drop them off, then how would they even get, like, because you said they missed school today, because she didn't want to drop them.

422
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:17,412
[SPEAKER_54]: This is beyond you.

423
00:35:19,865 --> 00:35:42,426
[SPEAKER_55]: We're trying to understand it with a few pieces of paper when you have a whole file at home, so just please bear with us I'm sorry and also this isn't something that really should be discussed in front of every person in Medford it really is a private matter and I Highly advise that if we need to continue this that we go into executive session for the respect of your family I would be happy to turn my phone calls

424
00:35:45,198 --> 00:35:47,379
[SPEAKER_46]: I called the office, I leave messages, I don't hear back.

425
00:35:47,399 --> 00:35:54,863
[SPEAKER_46]: So if I could get a meeting with Mr. Billson and yourself, that would be great, and maybe our attorneys, I would sell for that.

426
00:35:54,983 --> 00:35:56,784
[SPEAKER_27]: So let me just say one more thing.

427
00:35:57,264 --> 00:36:03,507
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't know your status, but as far as I know, you're a significant other but not a custodial parent.

428
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:04,428
[SPEAKER_27]: Am I right?

429
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:05,528
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm not a custodial parent, no.

430
00:36:05,548 --> 00:36:08,390
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, so as a result, I can't talk to you about the child technically.

431
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,150
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, with permission you can.

432
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:11,751
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, well, I don't have that.

433
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:13,012
[SPEAKER_27]: No one gave me that permission yet.

434
00:36:13,512 --> 00:36:18,055
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, so you know this this is a complicated little circle here.

435
00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:20,397
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean this it's filled with all kinds of

436
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:23,700
[SPEAKER_27]: of things that we can and can't do.

437
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:35,247
[SPEAKER_27]: So if the court had said, you know, you can put them in part-time, but the court is probably saying, I don't want to split the week up for these kids.

438
00:36:35,567 --> 00:36:37,269
[SPEAKER_27]: Let them be in one place and not in two places.

439
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,349
[SPEAKER_27]: That's probably what they did.

440
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:38,970
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

441
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,151
[SPEAKER_46]: It wouldn't work for either party.

442
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,673
[SPEAKER_46]: So that's what I'm saying.

443
00:36:43,693 --> 00:36:44,573
[SPEAKER_41]: So I move that the,

444
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:53,430
[SPEAKER_41]: party before us meets with the significant other and attorneys or whoever is appropriate and the mayor and superintendent.

445
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,011
[SPEAKER_41]: Seconded.

446
00:36:54,652 --> 00:36:54,873
[SPEAKER_55]: Seconded.

447
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:56,396
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion, roll call vote please.

448
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:00,648
[SPEAKER_41]: Mrs. Cugno?

[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

450
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:02,509
[SPEAKER_41]: Mrs. DiBenedetto?

451
00:37:02,749 --> 00:37:02,950
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

452
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,770
[SPEAKER_41]: Mrs. Kreatz?

453
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:04,531
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

454
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:05,632
[SPEAKER_41]: Mrs. Mustone?

455
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:06,032
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

456
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:06,833
[SPEAKER_41]: Mr. Scurry?

457
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:07,073
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

458
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:07,953
[SPEAKER_41]: Mrs. Van der Kloot?

459
00:37:07,994 --> 00:37:08,194
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

460
00:37:08,254 --> 00:37:08,694
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor Burke?

461
00:37:08,934 --> 00:37:09,154
[SPEAKER_55]: Yes.

462
00:37:09,255 --> 00:37:10,556
[SPEAKER_55]: I have an affirmative there and a negative.

463
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:11,356
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

464
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:13,898
[SPEAKER_55]: Report of Superintendent.

465
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:16,380
[SPEAKER_55]: Report on Team Medford Supply Drive.

466
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:22,165
[SPEAKER_27]: Mayor and members of the committee, we're going to call upon our Deputy Superintendent to take the lead on this.

467
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:28,890
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a very significant occasion for Team Medford and I'm going to let her do it because it's an important thing.

468
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,181
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, we're here with our team.

469
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:34,522
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm gonna ask our team to come up with me.

470
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:37,383
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a very special occasion.

471
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,885
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the 10th year we're having an anniversary tonight.

472
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:47,528
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a cake to celebrate our 10th anniversary.

473
00:37:48,448 --> 00:37:50,069
[SPEAKER_28]: I made it, yes, at Market Basket, yes.

474
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:51,610
[SPEAKER_28]: We do great work together.

475
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,399
[SPEAKER_28]: But once again, we are indebted to Team Medford.

476
00:37:55,999 --> 00:37:58,622
[SPEAKER_28]: Sam Terabelsi every year comes through.

477
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:05,968
[SPEAKER_28]: Of course, I know he would, because I also discovered we went to the same high school, Watertown High School, which I didn't know until this year.

478
00:38:06,548 --> 00:38:07,910
[SPEAKER_28]: So we've learned good things there.

479
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,433
[SPEAKER_28]: But I'm gonna ask Sam to come up and introduce his team that's with him tonight.

480
00:38:13,234 --> 00:38:16,357
[SPEAKER_28]: We, every year, go over the previous year amount.

481
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:17,538
[SPEAKER_28]: This year was $28,000, with Staples being our

482
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:30,130
[SPEAKER_28]: Our prime donated, but again, a lot of constituents participated in this and we have as a result school supplies that arrived before the first day of school.

483
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,011
[SPEAKER_28]: Principals picked them up.

484
00:38:32,672 --> 00:38:34,954
[SPEAKER_28]: Students had them in their hands the first day of school.

485
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:38,758
[SPEAKER_28]: So we are indebted to Sam and I will let him speak and then we'll have cake.

486
00:38:41,632 --> 00:38:42,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Beverly.

487
00:38:43,514 --> 00:38:45,076
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, 10 years.

488
00:38:45,536 --> 00:38:46,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

489
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:59,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine the idea of just came in as part of our sort of, as we started this committee, about 16 of us and sitting and thinking, what else can we do with the city?

490
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:03,213
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we connect the hospital with the city?

491
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:09,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And certainly our thoughts were more with the school programs, which I've known Mr. Belson for many years.

492
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:16,399
[SPEAKER_08]: And then one member just said, well, what if we do this back to school drive?

493
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it just got 16 of us.

494
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:20,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's a good thing.

495
00:39:20,821 --> 00:39:22,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about it.

496
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:24,143
[SPEAKER_08]: And the rest was history.

497
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,824
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just a team of

498
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:40,235
[SPEAKER_08]: volunteers from the hospital, which we still have team effort that we do on multiple things, including what we do in Kiwanis, the chamber, Tufts Community Day, and the mayor's outing that we do.

499
00:39:41,136 --> 00:39:44,220
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we really thought about it,

500
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:48,103
[SPEAKER_08]: It just became natural for us.

501
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:59,830
[SPEAKER_08]: It just, you know, we look for that moment, that June email that I've already sort of put together to Beverly to say, what do you, all of the principals, what do they need?

502
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Let us know, because we're gonna go and get what their needs are.

503
00:40:04,273 --> 00:40:12,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I wanna thank Staples, which is our major donor, and thanks Little Rocco, who has been the driving force to get Staples

504
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,952
[SPEAKER_08]: the amount that they donate.

505
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:24,815
[SPEAKER_08]: But many other organizations and all the employees at Hallmark Health Lawrence Memorial contributed to this.

506
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:35,259
[SPEAKER_08]: And before I introduce the members, I'm going to just introduce or really mention some of these groups, like the Medford Kiwanis, this year the Rotary Club.

507
00:40:36,157 --> 00:40:38,919
[SPEAKER_08]: the PTO, and then we have Armstrong.

508
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:52,111
[SPEAKER_08]: We also have Genesis, our nursing home, and then many other folks that just came in and offered their checks, their cash, and we have gone and bought certain things to really make it happen.

509
00:40:52,532 --> 00:40:56,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So my committee that's here is Lou Rocco, spent from day one.

510
00:40:57,556 --> 00:41:07,306
[SPEAKER_08]: We got from Armstrong, Chris Hill, representing Armstrong, which every year they make donations to our program, and they have a box in their local place that they collect.

511
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:14,853
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my partner, Janet Perrault, she's always there with us trying to get this program going too.

512
00:41:15,534 --> 00:41:15,894
[SPEAKER_08]: for us.

513
00:41:16,615 --> 00:41:21,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe Ramos again has been over and over an outstanding gentleman.

514
00:41:21,577 --> 00:41:27,301
[SPEAKER_08]: He's in Italy as he usually is and he just again looks forward to this.

515
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:35,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, thank you so much for allowing us to do this and giving us this opportunity to give back to the students and make their school year a successful year.

516
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:36,246
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

517
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:49,620
[SPEAKER_55]: Well, on behalf of all of the children of the city of Medford, we want to thank you for all the hard work you do, how you coordinate this and get so many backpacks in the hands of needy children.

518
00:41:50,261 --> 00:41:53,283
[SPEAKER_55]: We're astounded and we're just so thankful to have you a part of our community.

519
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:54,223
[SPEAKER_55]: So thank you all.

520
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:05,490
[SPEAKER_55]: Is there a motion on the floor?

521
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:10,818
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion to accept by Ms.

522
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:13,140
[SPEAKER_55]: Cunha, seconded by Ms.

523
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,521
[SPEAKER_55]: Kritz.

524
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:14,582
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

525
00:42:14,822 --> 00:42:15,122
[SPEAKER_55]: Aye.

526
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:15,783
[SPEAKER_55]: All those opposed?

527
00:42:15,843 --> 00:42:16,543
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

528
00:42:18,726 --> 00:42:21,568
[SPEAKER_55]: Report on a Giro backpack donation program.

529
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:25,332
[SPEAKER_27]: So another important thing, and Diane is going to fill you in on a Giro.

530
00:42:26,673 --> 00:42:28,454
[SPEAKER_40]: So is it proper to say, let them eat cake?

531
00:42:28,555 --> 00:42:30,616
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

532
00:42:30,956 --> 00:42:40,944
[SPEAKER_40]: In addition to our team Medford Patriots and whatever they do for us in Medford Public Schools, we also need to take this opportunity to thank Jero.

533
00:42:43,184 --> 00:43:04,641
[SPEAKER_40]: specifically Mr. Sidney Wolfe, the founder of Agero and the cross-country group, David Farrick, who is CEO and President of Agero, Sandy Savage, Vice President of Human Resources, Sandy Reyes, Human Resources Business Partner, and all the local employees of Agero for their generous donation of backpacks and other school supplies.

534
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:11,307
[SPEAKER_40]: So, like Beverly, when I get that phone call from Sandy Reyes at Agero saying, are you coming?

535
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:23,632
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm just there, Michelle and I, my administrative assistant and I go over to Ajero and we get 60 backpacks and they're filled with school supplies for the kids.

536
00:43:23,712 --> 00:43:31,616
[SPEAKER_40]: There are pencils and pens and markers and notebooks all filled and even additional boxes that we have.

537
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:38,619
[SPEAKER_40]: So they're not just for elementary, we try to parcel it out so we can give some of the backpacks to middle schools as well.

538
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:45,741
[SPEAKER_40]: So together our principals decided that the backpacks should be disseminated to the most economically disadvantaged students.

539
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:57,087
[SPEAKER_40]: We've also saved a number of the backpacks to present to the Department of Social Services at our regular holiday donation drive, which I think most of you know we've been doing this for years now.

540
00:43:57,187 --> 00:44:00,148
[SPEAKER_40]: So we keep some of those backpacks back.

541
00:44:02,357 --> 00:44:10,181
[SPEAKER_40]: And we are just so fortunate to have generous partners such as Agero who continue to make a real difference in the lives of our children in school.

542
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:21,266
[SPEAKER_40]: So currently the backpacks are in my literacy office and we will be disseminating maybe six or 10 per school for the elementary and the middle schools.

543
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:28,430
[SPEAKER_40]: And then obviously we'll give some supplies to our high school and our vocational schools, pencils and pens and whatever they need as well.

544
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:36,492
[SPEAKER_40]: Mr. Wolfe couldn't be here tonight, but he wanted to send his best, and we just want to thank all our great business partners.

545
00:44:37,172 --> 00:44:37,353
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

546
00:44:37,373 --> 00:44:37,873
[SPEAKER_41]: Van der Kloot.

547
00:44:38,633 --> 00:44:55,338
[SPEAKER_41]: I would like to make a motion that the school committee send a letter both to Team Medford and to Agero and Mr. Wolfe to thank them so that it could be posted someplace and express our appreciation for their incredible donations.

548
00:44:55,898 --> 00:44:57,299
[SPEAKER_41]: That would be great, thank you very much.

549
00:44:57,439 --> 00:44:59,180
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion, offered by Ms.

550
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,240
[SPEAKER_55]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Ms.

551
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:00,660
[SPEAKER_55]: Cuno.

552
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,481
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

553
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:01,561
[SPEAKER_55]: Aye.

554
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:02,761
[SPEAKER_55]: All those opposed?

555
00:45:02,781 --> 00:45:03,602
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

556
00:45:04,282 --> 00:45:06,023
[SPEAKER_55]: Mr. Superintendent, we'll get a letter out tomorrow.

557
00:45:07,284 --> 00:45:07,884
[SPEAKER_55]: Good, thank you, Ms.

558
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:08,404
[SPEAKER_55]: Caldwell.

559
00:45:08,424 --> 00:45:11,106
[SPEAKER_55]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

560
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:11,566
[SPEAKER_55]: So moved.

561
00:45:11,706 --> 00:45:12,346
[SPEAKER_55]: So moved.

562
00:45:12,726 --> 00:45:13,427
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

563
00:45:13,447 --> 00:45:14,067
[SPEAKER_55]: Aye.

564
00:45:14,107 --> 00:45:14,807
[SPEAKER_55]: All those opposed?

565
00:45:15,268 --> 00:45:16,028
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

566
00:45:16,848 --> 00:45:18,649
[SPEAKER_55]: Report on meeting with Wegmans.

567
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:19,190
[SPEAKER_55]: Ms.

568
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:19,670
[SPEAKER_55]: Nelson.

569
00:45:22,872 --> 00:45:24,573
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, from one store to the other.

570
00:45:24,793 --> 00:45:26,293
[SPEAKER_28]: A market basket to Wegmans.

571
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:40,139
[SPEAKER_28]: On Tuesday, August 15th, Wegmans hosted an informational meeting for several non-profits, community school, and city leaders at their offices at Station Landing in Medford.

572
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:46,922
[SPEAKER_28]: I was able to attend, along with Diane Caldwell, Chad Fallon, Jill Sawyer, and Lisa Evangelista.

573
00:45:47,502 --> 00:45:49,663
[SPEAKER_28]: We all represented the school district at the meeting.

574
00:45:50,643 --> 00:45:58,935
[SPEAKER_28]: And the purpose of the meeting is that the staff of Wegmans really wanted to learn more about what they could do for the community and for the schools.

575
00:45:59,877 --> 00:46:01,058
[SPEAKER_28]: They have a lot to offer.

576
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:03,877
[SPEAKER_28]: are still hiring.

577
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:08,499
[SPEAKER_28]: There was an article actually in the transcript that spoke to this meeting and what they're doing.

578
00:46:09,479 --> 00:46:16,642
[SPEAKER_28]: They're marking their 100th anniversary, and they actually have been named one of the best places to work in the United States.

579
00:46:17,683 --> 00:46:31,428
[SPEAKER_28]: We were welcomed by the store manager, Kevin Russell, the store manager, the Medford service manager, Paula Colnane, and Mary Ellen Burris, who is the Senior Vice President of Consumer Affairs.

580
00:46:32,428 --> 00:46:40,136
[SPEAKER_28]: All three have had long standing roles in the company and could not speak more highly about what the company has done for their careers and communities.

581
00:46:40,676 --> 00:46:46,201
[SPEAKER_28]: Wegmans offers scholarships and some of the people there actually were started as clerks.

582
00:46:46,342 --> 00:46:54,269
[SPEAKER_28]: They started in Wegmans in different parts of the country and they were given scholarships and they continued their undergraduate and graduate studies.

583
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:55,350
[SPEAKER_28]: So they're very generous.

584
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:59,134
[SPEAKER_28]: We could not be more warmly welcomed by them.

585
00:46:59,154 --> 00:47:06,923
[SPEAKER_28]: Not only did they have a lovely breakfast for us, they again wanted to know what we could do, what they could do for us moving forward.

586
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:14,631
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, we're hoping that some of our students will apply for some of the part-time jobs because it can lead to scholarship opportunities for them.

587
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:20,536
[SPEAKER_28]: They also gave us a lovely goody bag, which contained breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next couple of days.

588
00:47:20,877 --> 00:47:22,538
[SPEAKER_28]: Their products are really lovely.

589
00:47:23,479 --> 00:47:24,700
[SPEAKER_28]: They have all the ingredients.

590
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:29,484
[SPEAKER_28]: They're very concerned about food allergies, things that we're concerned about in the schools as well.

591
00:47:29,984 --> 00:47:31,445
[SPEAKER_28]: So we welcome them to Medford.

592
00:47:31,485 --> 00:47:36,950
[SPEAKER_28]: They couldn't speak more highly of things that they wanted to do for us, and we will coordinate

593
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:44,353
[SPEAKER_28]: probably through Lisa and the school so that not everybody's kind of at the same time asking for things all during the school year.

594
00:47:44,554 --> 00:47:46,094
[SPEAKER_28]: They're officially open November 5th.

595
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:47,695
[SPEAKER_50]: Mr. Benedetto.

596
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:49,396
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you, thank you Mayor Burke.

597
00:47:50,336 --> 00:47:56,499
[SPEAKER_50]: So thank you for the report and I'm glad we're starting early to hit them up for stuff.

598
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,981
[SPEAKER_50]: Next time I'd like to come to that meeting so I can get a baby bag.

599
00:48:02,402 --> 00:48:04,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we'll make sure you're included.

600
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:05,504
[SPEAKER_50]: That's fine.

601
00:48:05,645 --> 00:48:10,971
[SPEAKER_50]: My real point is, are we going to set up a co-op with our vocational students with Wegmans?

602
00:48:11,051 --> 00:48:18,880
[SPEAKER_50]: Because I don't know if they mail prep right there, but a lot of our culinary students could get a lot of expertise and knowledge.

603
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:24,707
[SPEAKER_50]: So the sooner we could maybe start that conversation, the better.

604
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:27,273
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, Chad and Jill were there at the meeting.

605
00:48:28,054 --> 00:48:31,798
[SPEAKER_28]: We did inform them about the new restaurant that's opening at the school.

606
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:35,763
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm sure they will further those discussions, because they were present.

607
00:48:36,183 --> 00:48:39,485
[SPEAKER_50]: And they will also have a restaurant on site as well within the Wegmans.

608
00:48:39,966 --> 00:48:44,249
[SPEAKER_50]: Right, that's why I thought it was a good opportunity for a co-op.

609
00:48:44,589 --> 00:48:53,036
[SPEAKER_50]: So maybe when we do our grand opening at our restaurant, we can make sure that Wegmans is sitting at the first table.

610
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:54,797
[SPEAKER_28]: We mentioned that to them, that we would invite them.

611
00:48:54,837 --> 00:48:57,159
[SPEAKER_28]: Chad mentioned that, that they would be invited to that too.

612
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,881
[SPEAKER_55]: Great, thank you so much.

613
00:48:59,022 --> 00:48:59,783
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

614
00:49:00,544 --> 00:49:02,568
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion of this report be placed on file.

615
00:49:02,628 --> 00:49:04,551
[SPEAKER_55]: Moved by Mr. Brennan, seconded by Ms.

616
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:04,932
[SPEAKER_55]: Vander Ploet.

617
00:49:04,952 --> 00:49:05,613
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

618
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:06,274
[SPEAKER_55]: Aye.

619
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:07,456
[SPEAKER_55]: All those opposed?

620
00:49:07,616 --> 00:49:08,377
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

621
00:49:09,532 --> 00:49:13,434
[SPEAKER_55]: Report on stop and shop donation to the public schools.

622
00:49:13,574 --> 00:49:16,856
[SPEAKER_27]: So Stop and shop is still working out the details.

623
00:49:16,896 --> 00:49:26,420
[SPEAKER_27]: So tonight we'll put it aside and wait on the table, but I can assure you that There's gonna be a lot of competition between supermarkets and Mr. Skerry all those in favor.

624
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,601
[SPEAKER_55]: I was opposed papers tabled.

625
00:49:27,621 --> 00:49:27,641
[SPEAKER_55]: I

626
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:42,658
[SPEAKER_55]: Update report on public release of MCAS 2.0 information and accountability ratings.

627
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:49,688
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm going to call upon our Director of Curriculum, Bernadette Riccadeli, to keep you informed of how MCAS is progressing out of the DESE.

628
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:51,911
[SPEAKER_48]: Good evening.

629
00:49:53,176 --> 00:50:00,800
[SPEAKER_48]: So I am here to report tonight on the scheduled releases of our assessment results for MCAS.

630
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:12,386
[SPEAKER_48]: So the next generation MCAS in grades three through eight, and the legacy MCAS, which is the old traditional MCAS at the high school, and also the accountability ratings.

631
00:50:13,007 --> 00:50:15,748
[SPEAKER_48]: So I've written a lot in the report.

632
00:50:15,808 --> 00:50:20,131
[SPEAKER_48]: I've taken the schedule directly from the Department of Ed site, so you have all of the dates.

633
00:50:20,891 --> 00:50:23,615
[SPEAKER_48]: I've highlighted the major dates in the report.

634
00:50:24,436 --> 00:50:28,522
[SPEAKER_48]: So as you can see, as early as June, we were receiving some raw data.

635
00:50:29,664 --> 00:50:36,714
[SPEAKER_48]: For the purpose of this report, I started in August, where we started seeing some of the preliminary data in raw format.

636
00:50:37,796 --> 00:50:40,700
[SPEAKER_48]: both the assessment as well as the accountability.

637
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:46,748
[SPEAKER_48]: So just jumping forward because everyone is waiting for the official results to come out.

638
00:50:47,269 --> 00:50:49,752
[SPEAKER_48]: So we need to wait until mid-October this year.

639
00:50:49,772 --> 00:50:52,516
[SPEAKER_48]: It seems like each year it's getting a little bit later.

640
00:50:53,617 --> 00:51:04,812
[SPEAKER_48]: So October 24th is the date in which the official district and school level MCAS and the MCAS alt results are released to the public.

641
00:51:05,293 --> 00:51:09,138
[SPEAKER_48]: The official accountability reports for all districts and schools will be released to the public.

642
00:51:09,959 --> 00:51:15,707
[SPEAKER_48]: And also the printed MCAS parent guardian reports will be received by the superintendent's office.

643
00:51:15,727 --> 00:51:17,349
[SPEAKER_48]: So October 24th is that date.

644
00:51:17,769 --> 00:51:25,559
[SPEAKER_48]: Now they do say that is an estimate, so we're planning right around that date for the results to be released.

645
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:36,442
[SPEAKER_48]: So, certainly we will be preparing reports for you so that as soon as possible, once they're unembargoed, we can report those to you.

646
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:48,545
[SPEAKER_48]: As far as the accountability schedule, reporting schedule is concerned, if we go back to November of 2015, the Board of Education amended the accountability system that we had in place.

647
00:51:49,646 --> 00:52:03,299
[SPEAKER_48]: And this was done so that districts and schools administering the next generation MCAS assessment in grades three through eight this past spring would not have their accountability results negatively impacted based on those scores.

648
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:21,451
[SPEAKER_48]: This regulation allows the Department of Education to limit the use of levels 1 through 3 this fall for any school that enrolls students in grades 3 through 8 as long as the school has a participation rate of at least 90% in the administration of this past spring's MCAS.

649
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,532
[SPEAKER_48]: So participation rate is key.

650
00:52:31,678 --> 00:52:32,859
[SPEAKER_48]: that's important to know.

651
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:36,063
[SPEAKER_48]: So again, not so much the assessment results, but participation.

652
00:52:37,564 --> 00:52:50,399
[SPEAKER_48]: The Department of Ed will publish next generation MCAS results for each school and district, including a normative measure of achievement to help districts and the Department of Ed identify schools that may require support.

653
00:52:52,014 --> 00:53:05,932
[SPEAKER_48]: The Department of Ed will report the participation rate separately for English language arts, mathematics, and science, and for each district and school as a whole, as well as for each subgroup.

654
00:53:06,152 --> 00:53:07,634
[SPEAKER_48]: So again, they're looking for a 90% participation rate.

655
00:53:10,598 --> 00:53:20,081
[SPEAKER_48]: Schools that assess at least 90% of their students in all groups and subjects will not be assigned an accountability and assistance level of one to three, one, two, or three.

656
00:53:20,561 --> 00:53:28,764
[SPEAKER_48]: Any school or district with participation rates below 90% for any group of students in any subject will be placed into level three.

657
00:53:29,844 --> 00:53:39,231
[SPEAKER_48]: As far as high school level testing is concerned, so we're talking about the legacy MCAS test, the assessment and accountability results will be reported.

658
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:53,621
[SPEAKER_48]: High schools will continue to receive an accountability and assistance level based on their PPI and the school percentile data with adjustments for those schools with persistently low graduation rates or very low assessment participation.

659
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:58,445
[SPEAKER_48]: So again, for the high school level, we're looking at participation and low graduation rates.

660
00:53:59,185 --> 00:54:06,427
[SPEAKER_48]: So as we move forward with this, a new accountability system is in the process of being developed.

661
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:13,368
[SPEAKER_48]: So this fall, the Board of Education will be considering those changes.

662
00:54:14,049 --> 00:54:19,910
[SPEAKER_48]: And the changes do need to be consistent with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.

663
00:54:21,432 --> 00:54:24,494
[SPEAKER_48]: So that in a nutshell is the reporting schedule.

664
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:29,077
[SPEAKER_48]: So again, October 24th is the date that we should have the official results.

665
00:54:29,137 --> 00:54:30,358
[SPEAKER_48]: I'm happy to take any questions.

666
00:54:30,538 --> 00:54:30,718
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

667
00:54:30,738 --> 00:54:31,278
[SPEAKER_41]: Van der Kloot.

668
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:32,879
[SPEAKER_41]: I have two questions.

669
00:54:32,899 --> 00:54:37,102
[SPEAKER_41]: The first question is, I remember that last year there were

670
00:54:37,502 --> 00:54:45,185
[SPEAKER_41]: there was the need for a lot of people to be concerned because some of the things that were reported out needed to be corrected.

671
00:54:45,566 --> 00:54:49,687
[SPEAKER_41]: There were lots of discrepancies, and I know that's a very timely thing.

672
00:54:50,608 --> 00:54:54,890
[SPEAKER_41]: Was the information that you received so far this year more accurate?

673
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,150
[SPEAKER_48]: It appeared so.

674
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:03,633
[SPEAKER_48]: There were a few things that we caught on the discrepancy report, so those have been addressed.

675
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:17,980
[SPEAKER_48]: We did not want a repeat of last year, which everything turned out fine, but we believe we caught the few discrepancies.

676
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,422
[SPEAKER_41]: But I know you had to do a lot of footwork last year.

677
00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:22,663
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

678
00:55:24,264 --> 00:55:27,105
[SPEAKER_41]: The second question has to do with the participation rates.

679
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:31,368
[SPEAKER_41]: Are we anticipating that our participation rates were solid?

680
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:35,711
[SPEAKER_41]: The initial look at it suggests that we are there.

681
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:37,372
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, we should have some idea, shouldn't we?

682
00:55:38,013 --> 00:55:38,513
[SPEAKER_48]: We should.

683
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:41,795
[SPEAKER_48]: I just do need to be careful because they're embargoed.

684
00:55:44,076 --> 00:55:46,257
[SPEAKER_48]: they look to be fine.

685
00:55:46,317 --> 00:55:47,517
[SPEAKER_48]: We're not concerned about that.

686
00:55:47,537 --> 00:55:49,338
[SPEAKER_41]: But we know who took the test and who didn't.

687
00:55:49,378 --> 00:55:49,578
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

688
00:55:50,078 --> 00:55:50,358
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

689
00:55:50,758 --> 00:55:50,938
[SPEAKER_48]: Yes.

690
00:55:51,218 --> 00:55:54,659
[SPEAKER_48]: So in the preliminary results, we actually get a percentage.

691
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:55,859
[SPEAKER_48]: So we looked at that.

692
00:55:56,459 --> 00:55:56,699
[SPEAKER_48]: Okay.

693
00:55:57,419 --> 00:55:57,740
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

694
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,880
[SPEAKER_50]: You're welcome.

695
00:55:58,900 --> 00:55:59,340
[SPEAKER_50]: Mr. Benedetto.

696
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,101
[SPEAKER_50]: My first thing is more of a statement than a question.

697
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:07,422
[SPEAKER_50]: It seems that the DESE is

698
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:33,479
[SPEAKER_50]: punishing school districts that have low participation rates so that they have forcing everybody to take this test at this time whether Whether they don't like it or not So I think that's a comment that's clear to me is that it's being pushed and if you do participate you get less punished as far as your rating or you get more time for your rating to

699
00:56:34,835 --> 00:56:36,997
[SPEAKER_50]: to be accountable.

700
00:56:37,377 --> 00:56:45,003
[SPEAKER_48]: Can I just clarify, the participation rate results refers to the number of students taking the test?

701
00:56:45,864 --> 00:56:56,392
[SPEAKER_50]: So like when parents decided that they would opt out, so they're holding the district's hands at, you know, pushing parents to opt in.

702
00:56:56,935 --> 00:57:01,340
[SPEAKER_50]: for this because districts are gonna really push for every child to take it.

703
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:09,928
[SPEAKER_50]: And I knew that we had an issue last year with a subgroup with participation rate because of absences or other issues.

704
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:15,314
[SPEAKER_50]: And so I'm sure we were very careful ourselves to make sure that our participation rate

705
00:57:15,746 --> 00:57:19,028
[SPEAKER_50]: was appropriate when we were taking the test.

706
00:57:19,248 --> 00:57:21,009
[SPEAKER_50]: So, those are just some comments.

707
00:57:21,029 --> 00:57:37,198
[SPEAKER_50]: So, I know parents were really pushing against it and didn't want their children to take this test, but it's very important to the district that it does, and the district does get punished from DESE, if not, or held at a higher accountability than districts that parents don't opt out.

708
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:40,560
[SPEAKER_50]: So, that's just a comment from what I've seen.

709
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,061
[SPEAKER_50]: Secondly, I wanted to know,

710
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:50,073
[SPEAKER_50]: So the BN keeps us from going over any preliminary results that the district gets.

711
00:57:50,293 --> 00:58:01,436
[SPEAKER_50]: As a committee, we can't notify, because we are... Well, it's a public meeting, so we cannot release the results to... But if we went into an executive session, can we be updated?

712
00:58:02,277 --> 00:58:02,937
[SPEAKER_50]: It's embargoed.

713
00:58:03,137 --> 00:58:03,637
[SPEAKER_50]: It's embargoed?

714
00:58:03,657 --> 00:58:05,077
[SPEAKER_50]: You gotta ask the question.

715
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:06,658
[SPEAKER_27]: It's embargoed, Dave.

716
00:58:08,282 --> 00:58:13,925
[SPEAKER_27]: Part of the reason is because of discrepancy reports and other things like that, they want to make sure everything is right before it goes out there.

717
00:58:14,545 --> 00:58:22,909
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, you may have noticed in the Globe today, if you read the Globe at all, that there were some comments about 26 Boston schools were underperforming.

718
00:58:23,529 --> 00:58:28,632
[SPEAKER_27]: Somebody leaked something out there, and I'm sure there's going to be some comment out there.

719
00:58:28,912 --> 00:58:33,174
[SPEAKER_27]: It's very hard to know exactly how they're going to finally come down on things.

720
00:58:33,975 --> 00:58:39,591
[SPEAKER_27]: But we know one thing is if your participation rate is good, there's no accountability rating this year outside of the high school.

721
00:58:41,245 --> 00:58:42,446
[SPEAKER_50]: So that's my other comment.

722
00:58:42,766 --> 00:58:51,930
[SPEAKER_50]: So them waiving accountability doesn't mean that we're not accountable as a district to make sure that our children were ready last year and that they're ready in the future.

723
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:58,554
[SPEAKER_50]: So I don't like when they dangle that carrot in front of your face and say, oh, well, it doesn't count this year, so don't worry.

724
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:01,715
[SPEAKER_50]: It still counts to every parent and every child who took the test.

725
00:59:02,816 --> 00:59:05,437
[SPEAKER_27]: If I can just answer that a little bit.

726
00:59:05,477 --> 00:59:06,918
[SPEAKER_27]: I think the thing that you gotta remember

727
00:59:07,478 --> 00:59:10,841
[SPEAKER_27]: This is the first full year that MCAS 2.0 was out there.

728
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:17,066
[SPEAKER_27]: So as a result, as a new test, it really, in order to be fair to people, they had to see the kinds of questions.

729
00:59:17,546 --> 00:59:22,390
[SPEAKER_27]: They had to see what it was about, whether it really, you know, the questions were proper and the like.

730
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:24,812
[SPEAKER_27]: And they have to do that analysis with their own testing company.

731
00:59:24,872 --> 00:59:27,134
[SPEAKER_27]: So rather than, it's like a new product.

732
00:59:27,655 --> 00:59:28,916
[SPEAKER_27]: It's really in a pilot phase.

733
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:32,679
[SPEAKER_27]: So the second year, they're saying, okay, you had a year to try it out.

734
00:59:32,999 --> 00:59:34,360
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had a year to work out the bugs.

735
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,462
[SPEAKER_27]: Now we'll start to look at it for real.

736
00:59:36,942 --> 00:59:37,923
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's really part of it.

737
00:59:37,943 --> 00:59:43,990
[SPEAKER_27]: It isn't really an attempt to hide anything because I think some people in the state would love to issue accountability ratings.

738
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:49,716
[SPEAKER_27]: But having said that, I think part of it is because you can't just do that with new stuff.

739
00:59:49,776 --> 00:59:50,536
[SPEAKER_27]: You'd have to look at it.

740
00:59:53,515 --> 00:59:56,196
[SPEAKER_50]: We as a community are not accountable for that.

741
00:59:56,497 --> 01:00:01,239
[SPEAKER_50]: We are still accountable for teaching our children how to take this test and how to do well on it.

742
01:00:01,499 --> 01:00:15,407
[SPEAKER_50]: And I don't want parents to think, oh, because it's not accountable by DESC that we aren't accountable as a committee and as an educational entity to our students and to our teachers.

743
01:00:15,767 --> 01:00:17,488
[SPEAKER_50]: but have them do very well.

744
01:00:17,648 --> 01:00:19,149
[SPEAKER_50]: I just wanted to put that out there.

745
01:00:19,429 --> 01:00:35,059
[SPEAKER_50]: I don't like it when they say it doesn't count, because it counts, because the kids took the time to take the exam, and you guys, as a school district, we spent a lot of time and a lot of money making sure that we do this well and do it right, so it does, it counts.

746
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:43,364
[SPEAKER_50]: And it's the data, we'll use that data to set up for next year, so it does count to us in so many ways.

747
01:00:43,844 --> 01:00:47,785
[SPEAKER_50]: So that's just another comment, nothing directed at anybody here.

748
01:00:49,385 --> 01:01:00,488
[SPEAKER_50]: So to my colleague who's the committee chair of the academic committee, last year there was a meeting to go over the results because it's very involved.

749
01:01:01,568 --> 01:01:05,769
[SPEAKER_41]: So as a... Yes, but we haven't gotten any results yet.

750
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:11,351
[SPEAKER_50]: But we could schedule the meeting and then, so we know the results are coming the 24th.

751
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:11,811
[SPEAKER_27]: We always do.

752
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,271
[SPEAKER_27]: Let's just look at schedules.

753
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:15,854
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, there's a lot of things you want to talk about.

754
01:01:16,295 --> 01:01:17,537
[SPEAKER_27]: Tonight was a good example.

755
01:01:17,718 --> 01:01:19,000
[SPEAKER_27]: But we'll get a meeting.

756
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:22,086
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not something, you know, we obviously have those meetings.

757
01:01:22,106 --> 01:01:23,890
[SPEAKER_41]: Traditionally, it goes to the curriculum subcommittee.

758
01:01:24,922 --> 01:01:25,022
[SPEAKER_57]: Ms.

759
01:01:25,062 --> 01:01:27,543
[SPEAKER_57]: Mustone, were you going to say something, Mr. Belson?

760
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:28,863
[SPEAKER_27]: I just want to say one thing.

761
01:01:29,043 --> 01:01:40,065
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been talking to Senator Jalen, who's about to file a bill in the legislature, in the Senate, looking to modify the accountability system in a substantial way.

762
01:01:41,345 --> 01:01:50,587
[SPEAKER_27]: Where it goes, how it goes, but you can clearly tell that the debate is very strong these days about academic proficiency not being the only way you measure a school.

763
01:01:51,547 --> 01:02:03,444
[SPEAKER_27]: And two polls were out, the Gallup poll and the Phi Delta Kappan poll, both of which sampled parents across the country, all of whom were saying there's more to school than testing.

764
01:02:03,844 --> 01:02:06,007
[SPEAKER_27]: And the pushback is becoming very, very strong.

765
01:02:06,925 --> 01:02:11,551
[SPEAKER_27]: The Massachusetts Board of Education tends to be very protesting.

766
01:02:12,111 --> 01:02:13,613
[SPEAKER_27]: So we'll have to see where that plays out.

767
01:02:13,673 --> 01:02:24,066
[SPEAKER_27]: But there's an awful lot of ferment out there right now about the implications of just simply evaluating schools only on test results.

768
01:02:24,752 --> 01:02:28,715
[SPEAKER_27]: So I've seen portions of Senator Jalen's bill.

769
01:02:29,236 --> 01:02:32,318
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll introduce it to you at some point in the near future when she's ready to release it.

770
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:38,343
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I think there's a lot of good material in there, looking at how to look at schools in a more comprehensive way.

771
01:02:38,744 --> 01:02:40,645
[SPEAKER_27]: We talk about social and emotional learning.

772
01:02:40,945 --> 01:02:42,927
[SPEAKER_27]: We talk about career and technical education.

773
01:02:43,187 --> 01:02:44,048
[SPEAKER_27]: We talk about health.

774
01:02:44,508 --> 01:02:46,050
[SPEAKER_27]: All those things are important in a school.

775
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:49,072
[SPEAKER_27]: We're developing youth that have transitioned to adulthood.

776
01:02:49,392 --> 01:02:50,894
[SPEAKER_27]: We're not just developing test takers.

777
01:02:51,474 --> 01:03:04,284
[SPEAKER_27]: So a good school in a community like in Boston, where you've got 26 schools that someone decided was underperforming, there's a lot of things that go on in some of those demographies out there that are far more complex than just simply a test score.

778
01:03:04,904 --> 01:03:10,469
[SPEAKER_27]: So how we look at our young people, how we look at schools, and what we do needs more scrutiny.

779
01:03:10,509 --> 01:03:16,413
[SPEAKER_27]: And I think Senator Jalen and others are starting to raise that question in a very, very powerful way in the state.

780
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:17,474
[SPEAKER_57]: Ms.

781
01:03:17,514 --> 01:03:17,914
[SPEAKER_57]: Musto?

782
01:03:17,954 --> 01:03:18,115
[SPEAKER_57]: Sure.

783
01:03:19,264 --> 01:03:20,425
[SPEAKER_57]: You had mentioned discrepancy.

784
01:03:20,485 --> 01:03:23,548
[SPEAKER_57]: Is that part of the embargoed information, or could you elaborate?

785
01:03:23,568 --> 01:03:24,089
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes, it is.

786
01:03:24,189 --> 01:03:26,871
[SPEAKER_57]: So in October, we will know what the discrepancies were?

787
01:03:27,252 --> 01:03:27,452
[SPEAKER_48]: No.

788
01:03:27,552 --> 01:03:31,776
[SPEAKER_48]: So there's a discrepancy reporting window, which was in August.

789
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:39,223
[SPEAKER_48]: So that's when the administrators, the principals, the curriculum directors take a look at, we take an initial look at the data.

790
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:40,964
[SPEAKER_48]: We look at the students who took the test.

791
01:03:41,765 --> 01:03:48,167
[SPEAKER_48]: to see if there's anybody missing, if the numbers are correct in terms of who was supposed to be participating.

792
01:03:48,747 --> 01:03:59,630
[SPEAKER_48]: So we have, I don't know, it's about 10 days or so a week in which we then can report to the state that there was a discrepancy in what they have on paper and what we have as far as our students.

793
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:04,932
[SPEAKER_48]: So that is not, that's not reported out in any official results.

794
01:04:04,952 --> 01:04:08,713
[SPEAKER_57]: Were there many discrepancies between what the state presented to you and what you had?

795
01:04:08,834 --> 01:04:10,174
[SPEAKER_48]: I don't know the exact number.

796
01:04:10,194 --> 01:04:12,215
[SPEAKER_48]: I think that it was minimal.

797
01:04:13,315 --> 01:04:14,556
[SPEAKER_48]: There were more last year.

798
01:04:16,577 --> 01:04:23,279
[SPEAKER_48]: It was not, the initial look at the data would suggest that it was pretty accurate.

799
01:04:23,299 --> 01:04:27,301
[SPEAKER_27]: So let me give you an example of something that was an interesting one last year.

800
01:04:28,061 --> 01:04:29,062
[SPEAKER_27]: Fascinating kind of thing.

801
01:04:29,785 --> 01:04:41,074
[SPEAKER_27]: A student who came to this country, booked a test, but didn't take the English Language Arts test because it was his first year in the country.

802
01:04:41,694 --> 01:04:45,137
[SPEAKER_27]: However, because he had a SASID number when he was in the first grade,

803
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:48,307
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, he had been in the country for a short period of time.

804
01:04:48,687 --> 01:04:51,807
[SPEAKER_27]: The state decided that he was, in fact, not a first year student.

805
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:54,368
[SPEAKER_27]: We had to petition and clean that out.

806
01:04:55,228 --> 01:04:59,729
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, how would we know, coming from another district someplace else, that this wasn't his first year?

807
01:05:00,649 --> 01:05:02,270
[SPEAKER_27]: That's an example of a discrepancy.

808
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:12,212
[SPEAKER_27]: Medicals, people that are out on a medical, who somehow don't get coded out of the thing, all of a sudden you have to go back and say, well, this kid's been in the hospital for the last six months.

809
01:05:13,063 --> 01:05:14,083
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, how can you count them?

810
01:05:14,103 --> 01:05:17,264
[SPEAKER_27]: They couldn't possibly take the test in the setting they were in.

811
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:27,848
[SPEAKER_27]: So those are some of the things that happen, and you have to pay attention to those, because otherwise, you have 100 kids, and five or six kids don't take the test for various reasons.

812
01:05:27,908 --> 01:05:30,369
[SPEAKER_27]: All of a sudden, you're below a certain threshold.

813
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:32,730
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's what you've got to pay attention to.

814
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:36,531
[SPEAKER_27]: And with subgroups, it's even less, because the subgroups are even smaller numbers.

815
01:05:37,131 --> 01:05:41,533
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you have 25 kids, one kid could be four percentage points.

816
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:43,420
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

817
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:47,225
[SPEAKER_41]: Motion to accept and place on file.

818
01:05:47,666 --> 01:05:48,747
[SPEAKER_41]: And thank you, Bernadette.

819
01:05:48,767 --> 01:05:50,970
[SPEAKER_55]: That's a motion to accept and place on file.

820
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:51,691
[SPEAKER_55]: Seconded by Ms.

821
01:05:51,731 --> 01:05:51,972
[SPEAKER_55]: Cunha.

822
01:05:52,112 --> 01:05:52,973
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

823
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:53,413
[SPEAKER_55]: Aye.

824
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:54,475
[SPEAKER_55]: All those opposed?

825
01:05:54,495 --> 01:05:55,236
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passed.

826
01:05:56,718 --> 01:05:58,540
[SPEAKER_55]: We put on summer programs.

827
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,583
[SPEAKER_27]: Dave, Beverly's going to do this.

828
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:04,028
[SPEAKER_28]: I have Anthony with me tonight.

829
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:09,171
[SPEAKER_28]: As all of you know, we run a full complement of summer programs.

830
01:06:09,871 --> 01:06:12,393
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of them are voluntary for students.

831
01:06:13,193 --> 01:06:20,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of them are mandatory, like regular summer school for making up courses during the school year that a youngster may have failed.

832
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:24,360
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of them have a cost to them, and some are free of charge.

833
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:28,062
[SPEAKER_28]: We have, again, a lot of things going on all summer long.

834
01:06:28,962 --> 01:06:36,006
[SPEAKER_28]: I asked people who ran programs to come tonight to present to you themselves, and Anthony volunteered to come.

835
01:06:36,366 --> 01:06:39,708
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll start with the Summer Fund Program, and Anthony, you want to tell us a little bit about that?

836
01:06:49,408 --> 01:06:50,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, thank you for having me.

837
01:06:50,569 --> 01:06:51,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Anthony Pachelis.

838
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:54,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the director of the Mefford Summer Fund Program.

839
01:06:54,353 --> 01:06:57,416
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in its 11th year of existence and my 10th year running it.

840
01:06:57,857 --> 01:07:03,703
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just gonna give you a short, you know, a little description about the camp, but as I said, this is our 11th year of running it.

841
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:05,805
[SPEAKER_10]: We run out of Mefford High School.

842
01:07:06,266 --> 01:07:07,487
[SPEAKER_10]: We average about 130 to 140 kids a week.

843
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:14,291
[SPEAKER_10]: At some weeks, we're able to hit up into the 160s, one high 150s, low 160s.

844
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:16,912
[SPEAKER_10]: We provide breakfast every morning for the children.

845
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,573
[SPEAKER_10]: Every Friday, we provide them free pizza for lunch.

846
01:07:20,373 --> 01:07:29,176
[SPEAKER_10]: And throughout the week, we have different activities that come to camp, whether it's a magician, a carnival, and so on that we provide for the kids each week that they're registered.

847
01:07:29,516 --> 01:07:31,517
[SPEAKER_10]: We also hold the World Cup soccer tournament.

848
01:07:31,877 --> 01:07:33,198
[SPEAKER_10]: We hold the dodgeball tournament.

849
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:56,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And this year we were able to partner up with Miss Stone, and we were able, with the Greater Boston Food Bank, the mayor, and Hallmark helped to get food donated every Friday to camp for families, so on the way that the families were picking up their kids, we were able to have bags of food provided for families for dinner for that night or over the weekend.

850
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:06,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Over the four weeks we did it, we did it four Fridays, July 28th, August 4th, August 11th, and August 18th, we were able to give away over 250 bags.

851
01:08:06,424 --> 01:08:14,028
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was great, a lot of parents were very pleased and very happy that we were able to provide a service like that for them.

852
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:17,229
[SPEAKER_10]: As I said, I just wanted to come and talk about the camp.

853
01:08:17,249 --> 01:08:24,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's one of those great programs that we have in the city that a lot of people are starting to hear about and know about, and every single year we've grown in size.

854
01:08:25,391 --> 01:08:30,213
[SPEAKER_10]: We have over 30 employees, 33 employees, part-time and full-time.

855
01:08:30,633 --> 01:08:40,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of them are City of Mefford kids that went through the elementary schools and middle schools and high schools, and some are currently in high school or graduated from Mefford High or in college.

856
01:08:40,837 --> 01:08:47,299
[SPEAKER_10]: So we provide a great service for the youth of the community from elementary all the way up to high school and beyond.

857
01:08:49,304 --> 01:08:53,645
[SPEAKER_28]: That next year, Wegmans will help you with the food stuff.

858
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:56,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, when I heard that, definitely, absolutely, yeah.

859
01:08:56,486 --> 01:08:56,866
[SPEAKER_55]: Mayor Burke.

860
01:08:56,906 --> 01:09:04,587
[SPEAKER_55]: If I could just jump in on the food portion of it, and really, we have to thank Mia in a large way, not mean Mia, Mia.

861
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:10,589
[SPEAKER_55]: She really, we've had several meetings on food insecurity at City Hall, and Mia has been a part of all of those conversations.

862
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:16,830
[SPEAKER_55]: And she was with her van, we went in and picked up the whole truckload of stuff in her van one Friday,

863
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:18,632
[SPEAKER_55]: And it continued for four weeks.

864
01:09:18,672 --> 01:09:21,797
[SPEAKER_55]: So we want to really thank you, Mia, for all of your hard work.

865
01:09:21,917 --> 01:09:26,504
[SPEAKER_55]: And thanks to Sarah and Anthony for coordinating it once everything came back to you.

866
01:09:26,524 --> 01:09:29,128
[SPEAKER_55]: Because that was, I know, a lot of effort on your part as well.

867
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:31,912
[SPEAKER_55]: So thank you all for doing what you can for our kids.

868
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:33,893
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor Burke.

869
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:35,875
[SPEAKER_41]: I think that's such a great addition.

870
01:09:36,015 --> 01:09:44,380
[SPEAKER_41]: I also though just need to take a moment to thank my colleague Ann Marie Cuno who was a driving force of setting up the camp 11 years ago.

871
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,803
[SPEAKER_41]: It's been a long time of great successes.

872
01:09:49,104 --> 01:09:52,486
[SPEAKER_54]: It was one of my biggest, it was one of my things on my to-do list.

873
01:09:53,206 --> 01:09:56,610
[SPEAKER_54]: And as a co-founder of the program, I'm very proud of the program.

874
01:09:57,070 --> 01:10:01,694
[SPEAKER_54]: And like anything else, I always say that we have to have the foundation done the right way when we start something off.

875
01:10:02,255 --> 01:10:05,958
[SPEAKER_54]: So it has proved itself many times.

876
01:10:06,378 --> 01:10:07,840
[SPEAKER_54]: So I'm very proud of that program.

877
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:08,781
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

878
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:10,142
[SPEAKER_41]: And you do a great job, Anthony.

879
01:10:10,282 --> 01:10:10,662
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

880
01:10:10,702 --> 01:10:10,882
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

881
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,263
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

882
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:11,923
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

883
01:10:12,564 --> 01:10:13,124
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, guys.

884
01:10:13,285 --> 01:10:13,585
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

885
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:22,605
[SPEAKER_28]: It's amazing so many programs are going on simultaneously at the high school and they kind of all share the pool and the facilities and it seems to come together.

886
01:10:22,625 --> 01:10:24,747
[SPEAKER_28]: I really don't have a lot of problems.

887
01:10:25,167 --> 01:10:28,390
[SPEAKER_28]: People take care of their own business and Anthony's been wonderful with that program.

888
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:33,254
[SPEAKER_28]: Other programs, we always have our special education program.

889
01:10:33,314 --> 01:10:36,237
[SPEAKER_28]: Lisa Ionelli was overseeing it this year.

890
01:10:36,917 --> 01:10:39,760
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, this program is basically for students who

891
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:50,722
[SPEAKER_28]: have in their IEPs, extended year services, and again, they were approximately 145 students that participated in those programs this summer.

892
01:10:51,602 --> 01:10:54,023
[SPEAKER_28]: We have our English learner program.

893
01:10:54,263 --> 01:10:58,864
[SPEAKER_28]: Paul Texera, our new director, supervised that program.

894
01:10:59,144 --> 01:11:03,665
[SPEAKER_28]: Approximately 75 English learner students through grades one through 12.

895
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:08,829
[SPEAKER_28]: attended, they were at the McGlynn Elementary and the McGlynn Middle School.

896
01:11:09,269 --> 01:11:20,714
[SPEAKER_28]: We try to contain our programs in as few schools as possible so we get all the cleaning done and we tell John McLaughlin the schedule so he can work around it so it all seems to come together.

897
01:11:21,655 --> 01:11:31,859
[SPEAKER_28]: High School 101, this is a program that we started years ago when we had the academic support grant to support students who have difficulty passing MCAS.

898
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:38,541
[SPEAKER_28]: Dr. Kieser and David Blow were overseeing this organizing the program.

899
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:45,442
[SPEAKER_28]: It's basically a program for students who are coming into grade nine and it kind of gives them a jump start.

900
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:51,363
[SPEAKER_28]: All eighth grade students have math work to do over the summer and they have reading to do over the summer.

901
01:11:51,924 --> 01:11:59,065
[SPEAKER_28]: So we bring the students in about three or four days in August and the teachers are there to help them to finish the assignments because

902
01:11:59,545 --> 01:12:07,667
[SPEAKER_28]: Oftentimes these are the students that will go into the classes and the regular teacher in grade nine will say where's your summer reading or where's your summer math and they don't have it.

903
01:12:07,727 --> 01:12:15,929
[SPEAKER_28]: So this makes sure that they have those assignments completed and we also interface it with just getting used to the high school.

904
01:12:16,409 --> 01:12:18,810
[SPEAKER_28]: So during the time they're here they get to meet the

905
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:28,453
[SPEAKER_28]: the principal, the assistant principal of the high school, and their last day actually is the regular freshman orientation day, so they're on board for that as well.

906
01:12:28,893 --> 01:12:30,613
[SPEAKER_28]: That program was very popular.

907
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:35,855
[SPEAKER_28]: Once the grant no longer existed, we thanked the committee for supporting it in regular budget.

908
01:12:36,255 --> 01:12:38,756
[SPEAKER_28]: Parents love it, and it really does help those youngsters.

909
01:12:39,116 --> 01:12:42,457
[SPEAKER_28]: They benefit a great deal coming into school in the fall.

910
01:12:44,999 --> 01:12:46,721
[SPEAKER_55]: representative would like to comment on that.

911
01:12:51,959 --> 01:12:57,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a very fond memory of facilitating student orientation.

912
01:12:58,163 --> 01:13:06,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a group of people, a group of freshmen, who really knew their way around.

913
01:13:06,808 --> 01:13:11,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a group of people who were asking, what's C building, what's B building?

914
01:13:12,952 --> 01:13:16,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who really knew their stuff were the high school 101 kids.

915
01:13:19,016 --> 01:13:24,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if I did that as a freshman I would have been a lot less lost.

916
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:27,585
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's great.

917
01:13:27,625 --> 01:13:27,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

918
01:13:28,426 --> 01:13:28,666
[SPEAKER_28]: Great.

919
01:13:28,726 --> 01:13:29,807
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for that comment.

920
01:13:31,389 --> 01:13:32,330
[SPEAKER_28]: Other programs.

921
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,832
[SPEAKER_28]: We had regular summer school.

922
01:13:36,514 --> 01:13:39,115
[SPEAKER_28]: David Blow and Jill Sawyer were running that.

923
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:44,258
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, this program is for students who really have to make up a subject.

924
01:13:44,298 --> 01:13:49,020
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, one of the big pluses this year is we did not have a lot of seniors.

925
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:53,703
[SPEAKER_28]: Many times seniors who fail a subject, they can't graduate.

926
01:13:54,243 --> 01:13:59,246
[SPEAKER_28]: We actually, this spring, through credit recovery, got those seniors over the hump so that they

927
01:14:00,126 --> 01:14:06,610
[SPEAKER_28]: did not miss out on graduation, that they actually get into our graduation rate, which is a plus thing with our data.

928
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:11,372
[SPEAKER_28]: And also, we didn't have to have them pay for summer school.

929
01:14:12,473 --> 01:14:14,054
[SPEAKER_28]: As in the past, we've had a lot of seniors.

930
01:14:14,634 --> 01:14:19,157
[SPEAKER_28]: We also used our Play-Doh, our online courses a great deal.

931
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:23,400
[SPEAKER_28]: What we do is we have the curriculum directors look at the play.

932
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,844
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't throw students into online courses because some of them are better than others.

933
01:14:28,284 --> 01:14:32,948
[SPEAKER_28]: We make sure that the curriculum people are comfortable with the content of the course.

934
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:40,314
[SPEAKER_28]: And there were some courses, math courses, that perhaps really had to be delivered with a real teacher standing up in front of the class.

935
01:14:40,914 --> 01:14:44,677
[SPEAKER_28]: But most of the science classes, I believe all the science classes were done online.

936
01:14:45,018 --> 01:14:46,419
[SPEAKER_28]: This is the second year we did that.

937
01:14:46,979 --> 01:15:00,588
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, also the other benefit of online courses is that when summer school officially ended on whatever day that was in August, some students who still needed a little bit more time were allowed to have it because they could just continue online.

938
01:15:01,089 --> 01:15:02,269
[SPEAKER_28]: And that was a real plus.

939
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:11,776
[SPEAKER_28]: And also students could take more than two courses because traditional summer school you basically have an 8 to 10 and a 10 to 12, so you can only take two things.

940
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:18,278
[SPEAKER_28]: with the online a student on his or her own could take a third course so we see a lot of potential.

941
01:15:18,338 --> 01:15:19,300
[SPEAKER_28]: We hope to grow it.

942
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:23,328
[SPEAKER_28]: What we need to do is take the packaged programs

943
01:15:23,953 --> 01:15:34,398
[SPEAKER_28]: and make sure that we expand them with our own materials so that the curriculum directors feel that they're rigorous enough that they match the curriculum that would be a live course.

944
01:15:34,978 --> 01:15:37,859
[SPEAKER_28]: So again, we had a great success with students doing well.

945
01:15:38,139 --> 01:15:44,182
[SPEAKER_28]: We also, we learn, after we do our summer programs, we sit down, we just don't close the books and say, okay, that's it.

946
01:15:44,982 --> 01:15:46,203
[SPEAKER_28]: start again in June.

947
01:15:46,683 --> 01:15:49,004
[SPEAKER_28]: We basically brainstormed what we can do better.

948
01:15:49,564 --> 01:15:56,226
[SPEAKER_28]: And last year, we realized that the middle school students in summer school really were having a difficult time with the attention span.

949
01:15:56,246 --> 01:15:57,967
[SPEAKER_28]: They needed a different type of structure.

950
01:15:58,407 --> 01:16:04,770
[SPEAKER_28]: So what we did this year, through the efforts of Jill and David, is we kind of mixed it up for the middle school youngsters.

951
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:10,372
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, they did their math course, or they did their English course, but they also had a 45-minute block in between.

952
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,113
[SPEAKER_28]: Bernadette Riccardelli was part of the planning team on this.

953
01:16:13,813 --> 01:16:21,035
[SPEAKER_28]: where every week they did something different, whether it was an outdoor activity or learning some social emotional activities.

954
01:16:21,855 --> 01:16:27,937
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, it seemed to make them more liable to go back into the classroom and be much more focused.

955
01:16:27,977 --> 01:16:29,537
[SPEAKER_28]: So we liked that addition.

956
01:16:29,597 --> 01:16:30,517
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it worked well.

957
01:16:31,078 --> 01:16:33,098
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, we'll probably continue with that model.

958
01:16:33,118 --> 01:16:37,319
[SPEAKER_28]: It was just for sixth and seventh graders because those were the youngsters that were having difficulty.

959
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:40,140
[SPEAKER_28]: The eighth graders seemed to be okay with the traditional model.

960
01:16:43,155 --> 01:16:46,497
[SPEAKER_28]: Two other camps from basically middle school youngsters.

961
01:16:47,017 --> 01:16:49,999
[SPEAKER_28]: Jill Sawyer ran the CTE Explore Camp.

962
01:16:50,459 --> 01:16:57,283
[SPEAKER_28]: These are for middle school students who want to come into the vocational school, explore some of the offerings.

963
01:16:58,303 --> 01:17:05,407
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, they had a great chance to see some of the different shops, auto tech, biotechnical, carpentry, and so on.

964
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:13,797
[SPEAKER_28]: The students actually had I believe a swim, an hour swim in the pool, and that was well attended as well.

965
01:17:13,837 --> 01:17:16,100
[SPEAKER_28]: Very short program, but again, worthwhile.

966
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:21,365
[SPEAKER_28]: And then finally, we have with Molly Leighton, our Director of Instructional Technology.

967
01:17:22,186 --> 01:17:25,150
[SPEAKER_28]: She has her mobile app making summer camp.

968
01:17:25,654 --> 01:17:30,637
[SPEAKER_28]: that she held again at the McGlynn from July 17th to the 21st.

969
01:17:31,057 --> 01:17:36,660
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, this is tied to a funded program through the National Science Foundation project.

970
01:17:37,441 --> 01:17:38,702
[SPEAKER_28]: So any questions?

971
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:42,904
[SPEAKER_28]: I think everything went very well, and it's positive feedback.

972
01:17:44,245 --> 01:17:45,946
[SPEAKER_55]: Just a comment on the science camp.

973
01:17:45,966 --> 01:17:47,667
[SPEAKER_55]: I know the kids absolutely love it.

974
01:17:48,087 --> 01:17:51,989
[SPEAKER_55]: It's a real hit, and kids get a lot out of it, and a big jump for the next year, so.

975
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:52,330
[SPEAKER_28]: Great.

976
01:17:53,012 --> 01:17:54,492
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you for all the summer programming.

977
01:17:54,512 --> 01:17:55,533
[SPEAKER_55]: Are there any questions?

978
01:17:56,293 --> 01:17:56,473
[SPEAKER_55]: No?

979
01:17:56,693 --> 01:17:58,954
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion that this report be placed on file, authored by Ms.

980
01:17:58,994 --> 01:18:00,014
[SPEAKER_55]: Cunha, seconded by Ms.

981
01:18:00,034 --> 01:18:00,594
[SPEAKER_55]: Vander Kloof.

982
01:18:00,934 --> 01:18:01,655
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

983
01:18:01,675 --> 01:18:02,215
[SPEAKER_55]: Aye.

984
01:18:02,395 --> 01:18:03,255
[SPEAKER_55]: All those opposed?

985
01:18:04,696 --> 01:18:06,096
[SPEAKER_55]: Papers, passes.

986
01:18:07,196 --> 01:18:09,817
[SPEAKER_55]: Report on McGlynn Middle School action plan.

987
01:18:10,377 --> 01:18:12,598
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have a return visit from Evely.

988
01:18:13,358 --> 01:18:15,379
[SPEAKER_27]: Straight from Market Basket.

989
01:18:15,479 --> 01:18:15,999
[SPEAKER_28]: Waitmans.

990
01:18:16,799 --> 01:18:17,339
[SPEAKER_27]: Stop and shop.

991
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:17,880
[SPEAKER_27]: Stop and shop.

992
01:18:20,048 --> 01:18:23,831
[SPEAKER_28]: This report was included in your packet last week.

993
01:18:23,851 --> 01:18:29,656
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope you've had a chance to look it over, but we'd like to discuss it publicly tonight.

994
01:18:31,578 --> 01:18:38,123
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll start by just introducing the topic with regard to both schools that opened in 2001.

995
01:18:38,984 --> 01:18:41,906
[SPEAKER_28]: Both schools follow the same academic curriculum.

996
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:47,850
[SPEAKER_28]: They have the full complement of exploratory subjects, such as art, music, and health.

997
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:53,773
[SPEAKER_28]: There are the same number of guidance Councilors, school psychologists, in both schools.

998
01:18:55,314 --> 01:19:07,421
[SPEAKER_28]: The teaching staff are highly qualified teachers, all licensed, and while the nature of the activities may vary, they both offer, both schools offer after school activities.

999
01:19:08,678 --> 01:19:12,920
[SPEAKER_28]: One of the differences is the schools house different specialized populations.

1000
01:19:13,721 --> 01:19:21,645
[SPEAKER_28]: The Andrews, for example, houses the therapeutic learning program, while the McGlynn houses all of our EL middle school students.

1001
01:19:23,246 --> 01:19:26,348
[SPEAKER_28]: All content area classes are scheduled the same way.

1002
01:19:26,408 --> 01:19:30,570
[SPEAKER_28]: Everyone has the same amount of time in English, math, social studies, and science.

1003
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:36,974
[SPEAKER_28]: The Exploratories are scheduled slightly differently because of the different populations in the school.

1004
01:19:37,663 --> 01:19:43,906
[SPEAKER_28]: and the fact that many of the EL kids don't take foreign language, they need to have the exploratories in a different way.

1005
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:49,249
[SPEAKER_28]: But if you add up the time on a yearly basis, all students are getting the same amount of time.

1006
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:58,715
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just that in one school, they're getting it throughout the school year on a lesser basis, and in the other school, they get it more concentrated during one segment of the school year.

1007
01:19:59,255 --> 01:20:00,616
[SPEAKER_28]: But time-wise, it's the same.

1008
01:20:01,816 --> 01:20:03,957
[SPEAKER_28]: Inclusion is practiced in both schools.

1009
01:20:07,484 --> 01:20:18,153
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, since the opening of the new buildings in 2001, the district has offered parents of grade five students the opportunity to select a preferred middle school.

1010
01:20:19,054 --> 01:20:28,462
[SPEAKER_28]: The system has worked well until the past two years, when a disproportionate number of parents of students entering grade six selected the Andrews.

1011
01:20:29,383 --> 01:20:41,620
[SPEAKER_28]: Currently the Andrews has 45, I'm sorry, 47 more students entering grade six than does the McGlynn, and we can accommodate them through extra staffing, but again, it's not an ideal situation.

1012
01:20:43,078 --> 01:20:50,745
[SPEAKER_28]: We also have a significant discrepancy in the socioeconomic status of the student populations at each school.

1013
01:20:50,765 --> 01:21:01,194
[SPEAKER_28]: This is something that we do need to address more long-term, not tonight, but at other meetings that we need to have during the fall and during the winter.

1014
01:21:02,635 --> 01:21:31,122
[SPEAKER_28]: In order to correct for this imbalance, administrators at all levels, we came together once we saw this happening this spring, and it was central administration, it was the departmental people, and the building, the principals obviously were involved, and we worked throughout the spring and summer to make some changes that we wanted to put in place at the beginning of the school year that we thought would address some of these issues with the discrepancies or the idea that people were selecting the Anders over the McGlynn.

1015
01:21:32,503 --> 01:21:49,583
[SPEAKER_28]: We put some things in place and we are currently working on additional changes that can be put in place during the school year So just to kind of review what's happened at budget time the committee allowed the addition of one health teacher and

1016
01:21:50,024 --> 01:21:55,286
[SPEAKER_28]: and one Spanish teacher for additional staff to be shared by the two middle schools.

1017
01:21:56,086 --> 01:22:04,370
[SPEAKER_28]: We also added another EL teacher because that population at the McGlynn was growing leaps and bounds and we wanted to make sure the students were supported.

1018
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:11,753
[SPEAKER_28]: And the previous year we had already added a full-time librarian and a .5 adjustment Councilor.

1019
01:22:11,813 --> 01:22:14,954
[SPEAKER_28]: So we've been adding staff over the last couple of years.

1020
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:17,115
[SPEAKER_28]: During the summer,

1021
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:22,730
[SPEAKER_28]: There were several more measures that were put in place, and I'll review them with you.

1022
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:36,036
[SPEAKER_28]: We have new staff members that were hired to either fill vacancies or new positions that were created, and you have the list of all of those positions without the individual names of the teachers.

1023
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:38,837
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a new assistant principal in place.

1024
01:22:38,877 --> 01:22:41,038
[SPEAKER_28]: We have two special education teachers.

1025
01:22:42,059 --> 01:22:45,000
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a new reading teacher, an ELA teacher,

1026
01:22:45,799 --> 01:22:57,598
[SPEAKER_28]: a guidance Councilor, she's actually filling a leave of absence, the additional EL teacher, and then we have .5 health and .5 Spanish, that's them at Linn.

1027
01:22:57,939 --> 01:23:00,323
[SPEAKER_28]: The full-time was she at, the two full-time positions.

1028
01:23:01,773 --> 01:23:19,606
[SPEAKER_28]: The second thing we did is we took a look at the background of staff and we reassigned a few staff members to better serve the needs of students and to support some of the newer staff and to foster some of the new state required curriculum realignment.

1029
01:23:20,107 --> 01:23:23,129
[SPEAKER_28]: Realignments happened in science, English, and mathematics.

1030
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:28,393
[SPEAKER_28]: So, these are the changes without, again, names.

1031
01:23:28,413 --> 01:23:29,434
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a confidential

1032
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:33,793
[SPEAKER_28]: statement also attached with this that speaks to the science changes.

1033
01:23:34,414 --> 01:23:39,015
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, that statement does contain names, so that's why we have it marked confidential.

1034
01:23:39,675 --> 01:23:47,438
[SPEAKER_28]: But the changes dealt with changing a grade seven teacher to grade eight in science, and a grade eight teacher to grade seven.

1035
01:23:47,978 --> 01:23:52,060
[SPEAKER_28]: And this was based on the recommendations of Director Rocco Sieri,

1036
01:23:52,719 --> 01:24:03,763
[SPEAKER_28]: who knowing the background of both teachers, knowing the new frameworks, and the new frameworks realigned standards where they were taught in different grade levels, felt that that placement was warranted.

1037
01:24:03,823 --> 01:24:05,944
[SPEAKER_28]: So that was one of the changes that we made.

1038
01:24:08,185 --> 01:24:10,746
[SPEAKER_28]: There was another change with the grade seven and eight

1039
01:24:11,190 --> 01:24:12,671
[SPEAKER_28]: English language arts teacher.

1040
01:24:13,432 --> 01:24:16,935
[SPEAKER_28]: We hired a new English language arts teacher for the McGlynn.

1041
01:24:17,515 --> 01:24:24,822
[SPEAKER_28]: This teacher was brand new, but her student teaching and her background in, you know, again, student teaching mainly was at the high school level.

1042
01:24:25,422 --> 01:24:27,524
[SPEAKER_28]: We felt that putting her at grade eight

1043
01:24:27,904 --> 01:24:31,526
[SPEAKER_28]: was the proper placement since, again, she was more high school oriented.

1044
01:24:32,306 --> 01:24:34,728
[SPEAKER_28]: That was one part of the decision making.

1045
01:24:34,768 --> 01:24:44,713
[SPEAKER_28]: The second part was that the current eighth grade teacher, who's an excellent veteran teacher, we needed her expertise to go back into grade seven to help

1046
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:53,636
[SPEAKER_28]: The new reading teacher, in grade seven now, we're starting a new reading program, RTI, where we're going to identify students who really need the reading support.

1047
01:24:53,997 --> 01:25:04,501
[SPEAKER_28]: Grade six, all students get reading, but now grade seven and eight, it's going to be students who really need it through our testing, our study island we purchased to be able to identify those students.

1048
01:25:04,861 --> 01:25:09,383
[SPEAKER_28]: We felt that having a veteran seventh grade English teacher would assist that brand new reading teacher

1049
01:25:09,923 --> 01:25:12,746
[SPEAKER_28]: in making those assessments and placements of students.

1050
01:25:13,106 --> 01:25:15,248
[SPEAKER_28]: So that was the rationale for that change.

1051
01:25:16,008 --> 01:25:26,738
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, there was a grade eight team lateral change for two social studies teachers, again, teaching the same subject, teaching the same grade, just on different teams.

1052
01:25:26,778 --> 01:25:32,943
[SPEAKER_28]: And that was a measure to balance the two teams with veteran teachers and also to have a little better gender balance.

1053
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:39,753
[SPEAKER_28]: The change I mentioned before is the modification of how reading will be delivered.

1054
01:25:39,773 --> 01:25:41,697
[SPEAKER_28]: It's going to be, again,

1055
01:25:42,808 --> 01:25:46,730
[SPEAKER_28]: The RTI model that currently exists at the Andrews with a great deal of success.

1056
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:51,793
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, all students in grade six will receive basic reading instruction.

1057
01:25:52,733 --> 01:26:00,858
[SPEAKER_28]: Seven and eighth grade students will be given reading support based on needs as identified on the newly purchased assessment tool study island.

1058
01:26:00,918 --> 01:26:03,720
[SPEAKER_28]: So we purchased study island as been at the Andrews.

1059
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:07,542
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, we were able to purchase it for the McGlynn through a new grant.

1060
01:26:08,322 --> 01:26:11,065
[SPEAKER_28]: that Bernadette Riccadeli's overseeing, Title IV-A.

1061
01:26:11,945 --> 01:26:18,051
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, grade seven, ELA teachers, both grade seven teachers on both teams are very veteran.

1062
01:26:18,571 --> 01:26:26,098
[SPEAKER_28]: They're excellent teachers and we know they will provide a great amount of support for this new reading teacher as she gets started in her career.

1063
01:26:27,227 --> 01:26:43,312
[SPEAKER_28]: What we're going to be working on during the school year, we want to make sure that students have opportunities to have more clubs at the McGlynn, and opportunities for students to be able to go to different clubs, even if they're housed at another school.

1064
01:26:43,812 --> 01:26:47,873
[SPEAKER_28]: I know I had one parent, his daughter is really into theater and drama, and she's

1065
01:26:48,397 --> 01:26:54,605
[SPEAKER_28]: At the McGlynn, he's asked that she could be in the production that's done at the Yenders, and we're working on that.

1066
01:26:54,945 --> 01:27:00,151
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're trying to make sure that students are given the opportunity to join clubs at both schools.

1067
01:27:01,354 --> 01:27:15,140
[SPEAKER_28]: We are having more administrative support in the building so that we have an idea if people have concerns that they know there's always a place they can go in addition to the principal and to the new assistant principal.

1068
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,982
[SPEAKER_28]: Dr. Riccadeli is going to have and has had already.

1069
01:27:19,822 --> 01:27:33,710
[SPEAKER_28]: More of a presence in the school walking around the halls talking to the teachers seeing again expressing her interest in there what they're doing and if they have any concerns and Also, mr. Tick Sarah again our new EL director.

1070
01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:38,353
[SPEAKER_28]: He is going to have a presence there both direct both people are going to have a

1071
01:27:39,133 --> 01:27:43,695
[SPEAKER_28]: an office, we're working on that, where they can actually sit, and if a person wants to go to them, they can.

1072
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:52,140
[SPEAKER_28]: It was only natural to have Mr. Texera be there more because all of the EL middle school students and teachers are housed at the McGlynn.

1073
01:27:53,360 --> 01:28:04,766
[SPEAKER_28]: We've already decided that we're gonna have the open house for grade five parents together, both principals presenting, and then again, having the tours of the buildings for the parents.

1074
01:28:05,999 --> 01:28:23,934
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we need to, together, during the school year, work on some systemic changes to the protocols for the school selection, because what's happened is it's resulted in this imbalance in both numbers, but not just numbers, but socioeconomic status, and again, I believe it's

1075
01:28:24,975 --> 01:28:29,617
[SPEAKER_28]: 20% free and reduced lunch at the Andrews and 40% at the McLean.

1076
01:28:29,657 --> 01:28:31,578
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just like a huge discrepancy.

1077
01:28:31,898 --> 01:28:40,021
[SPEAKER_28]: So we have to together come up with a way for parents to have a voice in school selection, but get around this issue that's occurred this year.

1078
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:44,143
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, we'll have to sit down together and put all of our minds to that.

1079
01:28:46,985 --> 01:28:54,553
[SPEAKER_28]: We're planning for more programs at the McGlynn to perhaps attract some students back to the McGlynn.

1080
01:28:55,574 --> 01:28:56,275
[SPEAKER_28]: I know that Ms.

1081
01:28:56,335 --> 01:29:04,043
[SPEAKER_28]: Liu and I have spoken already about an Odyssey to the Mind program perhaps to go into the McGlynn, perhaps something around STEM.

1082
01:29:04,775 --> 01:29:06,315
[SPEAKER_28]: which would be something beneficial.

1083
01:29:07,276 --> 01:29:16,177
[SPEAKER_28]: And then we will look to move some EL classes back to the Andrews, similar to what occurred at the Roberts and the Brooks this year.

1084
01:29:17,378 --> 01:29:29,600
[SPEAKER_28]: The thinking was, we used to have EL students in both schools, and then about, I wanna say five years ago, we decided that we could actually use staff more efficiently if we had all of the students and all of the EL staff.

1085
01:29:30,161 --> 01:29:54,421
[SPEAKER_28]: in one building, but now the numbers have grown, so it's warranted that we could, again, have students move back and we would still not have, what we're having before with so few EL students is that you'd have the EL teachers running between buildings and losing time having to travel, but now we have so many more students, we feel we could have dedicated staff at each building, so we'll be looking to do that as well.

1086
01:29:55,723 --> 01:29:58,807
[SPEAKER_28]: And as we move forward, we will keep the committee informed.

1087
01:29:58,847 --> 01:30:01,710
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll look to you for some guidance on some of these large issues.

1088
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:09,000
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, we welcome your input as we move forward and do our best to make this a better situation.

1089
01:30:10,652 --> 01:30:10,792
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

1090
01:30:10,832 --> 01:30:12,113
[SPEAKER_41]: Vander Kloof.

1091
01:30:12,253 --> 01:30:20,558
[SPEAKER_41]: Beverly, one of the big concerns this year was for the students who wanted to go to the Andrews and didn't get into the Andrews.

1092
01:30:21,699 --> 01:30:35,347
[SPEAKER_41]: And you already note that we still have a 47 discrepancy, but it was more than that because there were parents of students who were very upset that this didn't work out well.

1093
01:30:37,008 --> 01:30:54,337
[SPEAKER_41]: I'm hoping that we are tracking those students and making sure that we know that a guidance Councilor, the principal, knows who those students are and are tracking how they're doing, helping make sure that they're getting connected to other kids in the school.

1094
01:30:55,558 --> 01:31:02,822
[SPEAKER_41]: And this was clearly a great concern to the committee members, so perhaps you could address that.

1095
01:31:04,572 --> 01:31:08,395
[SPEAKER_28]: In terms of the number of parents that wanted, we had a wait list.

1096
01:31:09,677 --> 01:31:10,737
[SPEAKER_41]: No, not in terms of that.

1097
01:31:11,158 --> 01:31:13,840
[SPEAKER_41]: What's being done now to make sure those students are?

1098
01:31:14,301 --> 01:31:26,311
[SPEAKER_28]: We have, again, what happened during the summer is that some parents that would call my office, they again had information that their student was the only student from that particular elementary school who wasn't going to the Andrews.

1099
01:31:27,166 --> 01:31:28,467
[SPEAKER_28]: We said that's not the case.

1100
01:31:28,527 --> 01:31:34,451
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, lists were made available of other students that were from the same school that were gonna go to the McGlynn.

1101
01:31:35,431 --> 01:31:36,832
[SPEAKER_28]: The principals are aware.

1102
01:31:37,173 --> 01:31:42,376
[SPEAKER_28]: Mr. Edwards is aware of the students that really wanted to go to the Andrews.

1103
01:31:42,436 --> 01:31:43,397
[SPEAKER_28]: He's working with them.

1104
01:31:43,477 --> 01:31:50,641
[SPEAKER_28]: For example, that young girl who wants to be in the production at the Andrews, we're working with her family to make sure she's doing that.

1105
01:31:51,382 --> 01:31:52,783
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, we're reassuring

1106
01:31:53,538 --> 01:32:03,127
[SPEAKER_28]: parents and I know a lot of that I did this summer is that the students adjust and you know it's really beneficial sometimes to meet new students.

1107
01:32:03,147 --> 01:32:11,574
[SPEAKER_28]: You're all going to be together in the high school in a few short years but we will make that transition for those students and those families that didn't get their first choice.

1108
01:32:11,954 --> 01:32:13,175
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll make sure that they

1109
01:32:14,317 --> 01:32:17,021
[SPEAKER_28]: it's duly noted and that they, again, dealt with.

1110
01:32:17,081 --> 01:32:21,968
[SPEAKER_28]: But I haven't gotten any phone calls since school began, quite honestly.

1111
01:32:22,849 --> 01:32:28,758
[SPEAKER_28]: So everybody seems to have, I don't know if you have any, but I haven't, it seems like people are settling in.

1112
01:32:28,818 --> 01:32:29,918
[SPEAKER_28]: when kids are settling in.

1113
01:32:30,118 --> 01:32:37,780
[SPEAKER_41]: I see that it says we have plans to have more clubs at the McGlynn or clubs where kids could both join.

1114
01:32:38,461 --> 01:32:40,821
[SPEAKER_41]: And the thing is, I think we need to do that right away.

1115
01:32:41,401 --> 01:32:54,245
[SPEAKER_41]: I want to see options so that those kids who feel that they're taken away from their friends have an opportunity to perhaps join something and not waiting until the second semester.

1116
01:32:54,705 --> 01:32:55,685
[SPEAKER_28]: No, we've already spoken.

1117
01:32:55,785 --> 01:32:58,026
[SPEAKER_28]: Paul and Jake both have sat down with me

1118
01:32:58,690 --> 01:33:05,918
[SPEAKER_28]: We're trying to see which clubs are the ones that, you know, more easily the kids can get to either school where they're gonna be housed.

1119
01:33:05,938 --> 01:33:08,661
[SPEAKER_28]: So we're making a list, and as I said, you know, Ms.

1120
01:33:08,741 --> 01:33:19,654
[SPEAKER_28]: Liu is very proactive, and she wants to get something going right away with, you know, at least that one club, and again, we're in the process of asking them what clubs they think that they want to add in.

1121
01:33:20,395 --> 01:33:29,961
[SPEAKER_28]: and then making sure we have the funding for the stipends for the teachers to, you know, jump to basically oversee to be facilitators of these clubs.

1122
01:33:30,501 --> 01:33:35,484
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're hoping that the teachers are gonna jump at the opportunity to run something new as well.

1123
01:33:35,764 --> 01:33:38,786
[SPEAKER_41]: I think we usually plan for stipends to take place.

1124
01:33:38,846 --> 01:33:45,891
[SPEAKER_28]: There is some, but we know we need additional, we need some additional ones and we're gonna prepare, we're prepared to entertain those requests.

1125
01:33:48,432 --> 01:33:48,832
[SPEAKER_57]: Beth Stone.

1126
01:33:48,892 --> 01:33:49,133
[SPEAKER_57]: Thanks.

1127
01:33:50,681 --> 01:33:54,383
[SPEAKER_57]: You would mention what's I mean odyssey of the mind with miss Lou.

1128
01:33:54,583 --> 01:33:56,865
[SPEAKER_57]: So is that a gifted and talented program?

1129
01:33:57,005 --> 01:33:57,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes Okay.

1130
01:33:57,885 --> 01:33:58,105
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1131
01:33:58,445 --> 01:34:05,229
[SPEAKER_28]: The thing is with the gifted and talented programs now Teachers that run them are supposed to have not a license.

1132
01:34:05,329 --> 01:34:13,734
[SPEAKER_28]: It's called an endorsement so we're looking to see who might have that endorsement or if the person needs to get the endorsement what they have to do to get it and

1133
01:34:14,178 --> 01:34:16,140
[SPEAKER_28]: and then we'll help them to get that endorsement.

1134
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:19,502
[SPEAKER_28]: So there's a few little regulatory things that we have to look into.

1135
01:34:19,803 --> 01:34:22,465
[SPEAKER_57]: And the same with that in the EL classes.

1136
01:34:22,585 --> 01:34:27,549
[SPEAKER_57]: Are we looking for September of 2018 to move half the EL to the Andrews?

1137
01:34:27,929 --> 01:34:30,091
[SPEAKER_28]: Not maybe half, but maybe some of the programs.

1138
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:34,615
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll take a look at what's going on and see what makes more sense.

1139
01:34:34,895 --> 01:34:38,438
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, we don't want to overcrowd the Andrews because they already have too many kids already.

1140
01:34:38,878 --> 01:34:54,853
[SPEAKER_57]: So we want to move kids in unless we can make sure that things are going to be a little bit more balanced all around And then I don't know because it's been 20 months what might have happened before I was on I was assigned to the Roberts for my children, and then I did not choose the Roberts.

1141
01:34:54,973 --> 01:34:59,117
[SPEAKER_57]: I love the Roberts I can't say enough about mr. Johnson, but then I get to pick middle school.

1142
01:34:59,437 --> 01:35:01,058
[SPEAKER_57]: Why don't we just assign?

1143
01:35:02,140 --> 01:35:17,155
[SPEAKER_57]: Families to one or the other middle school, so you don't have kids who are on a waitlist with your support We could entertain that as one of the options Before you go down that road we our schools were built on a racial balance plan

1144
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:20,419
[SPEAKER_27]: Schools were built with choice as one of the options.

1145
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:26,546
[SPEAKER_27]: And if we have to change that, we need to change the plan and get approval for it.

1146
01:35:26,586 --> 01:35:30,792
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't choose elementary, so weren't they built with the middle of the... No, you could choose elementary.

1147
01:35:30,812 --> 01:35:33,776
[SPEAKER_27]: See, one of the things is that people don't realize is when the schools were built,

1148
01:35:34,665 --> 01:35:38,847
[SPEAKER_27]: The essential part was, first of all, the Andrews and McGuinn were the first two schools that were built.

1149
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:44,530
[SPEAKER_27]: So it was, let's say, a progressive movement of youngsters.

1150
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:49,372
[SPEAKER_27]: But you could have chosen certain schools after the other schools were built.

1151
01:35:49,952 --> 01:35:54,114
[SPEAKER_27]: So there are plenty of people that have chosen schools outside of their geographical area.

1152
01:35:54,134 --> 01:35:55,075
[SPEAKER_27]: It's happened all the time.

1153
01:35:55,715 --> 01:35:57,096
[SPEAKER_27]: But now people are getting settled.

1154
01:35:57,116 --> 01:35:58,096
[SPEAKER_27]: They're getting comfortable.

1155
01:35:58,477 --> 01:36:01,118
[SPEAKER_27]: And to some degree, things have sort of settled in.

1156
01:36:01,158 --> 01:36:06,841
[SPEAKER_27]: People sort of stay in their own geographic area for the most part, although there are some people that want to go to another school.

1157
01:36:07,682 --> 01:36:15,687
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the things that we've got to deal with is that we may want to look at redistricting to some degree, because the Columbus is somewhat under-enrolled compared to some of the others.

1158
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:20,069
[SPEAKER_27]: And if we change a few lines, we'd get a few more people over there.

1159
01:36:22,170 --> 01:36:23,171
[SPEAKER_27]: Just got to look at those things.

1160
01:36:23,231 --> 01:36:24,211
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, it's all part of it.

1161
01:36:25,398 --> 01:36:29,201
[SPEAKER_27]: Choice was part of the plan in getting 90 cents on the dollar.

1162
01:36:29,881 --> 01:36:36,825
[SPEAKER_57]: Right, but it's not, to the family at home with a preschooler, no one thinks that we're a choice system.

1163
01:36:37,026 --> 01:36:39,167
[SPEAKER_57]: Everyone thinks you go to the school closest to your house.

1164
01:36:39,407 --> 01:36:42,209
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, you know, we get plenty of requests.

1165
01:36:42,309 --> 01:36:43,290
[SPEAKER_27]: Maybe you don't see it.

1166
01:36:44,373 --> 01:36:45,794
[SPEAKER_27]: We grant a lot of them.

1167
01:36:45,914 --> 01:36:48,375
[SPEAKER_27]: But you don't see them because you didn't make that request.

1168
01:36:48,395 --> 01:36:49,896
[SPEAKER_27]: But we grant a lot of requests.

1169
01:36:49,916 --> 01:36:51,677
[SPEAKER_27]: We take a look at class size first.

1170
01:36:52,197 --> 01:36:56,039
[SPEAKER_27]: We take a look at whether we think the trends are too much in one direction or the other.

1171
01:36:56,539 --> 01:36:59,641
[SPEAKER_27]: We look at the balance between different populations.

1172
01:37:00,461 --> 01:37:02,202
[SPEAKER_27]: But we have granted quite a bit.

1173
01:37:02,222 --> 01:37:03,043
[SPEAKER_27]: Diane, what would you say?

1174
01:37:04,003 --> 01:37:05,544
[SPEAKER_27]: Because Diane handles the elementaries.

1175
01:37:07,433 --> 01:37:19,701
[SPEAKER_40]: We do get a lot of requests for different areas in schools and for different reasons, but sometimes parents will send in a request because it's easier for them to get to work, to jump onto 93.

1176
01:37:20,201 --> 01:37:27,706
[SPEAKER_40]: Sometimes we have requests from parents who have childcare issues and the childcare person is in another school.

1177
01:37:28,327 --> 01:37:33,290
[SPEAKER_40]: So, you know, I can't give you a specific number, but we do get requests.

1178
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:34,151
[SPEAKER_57]: I know, but we're not,

1179
01:37:35,031 --> 01:37:35,832
[SPEAKER_57]: Selling ourselves.

1180
01:37:35,952 --> 01:37:43,277
[SPEAKER_57]: I don't go in with my four-year-old and say Roberts number one Columbus number two I don't there's really not a choice system.

1181
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:59,488
[SPEAKER_41]: So let's know unless you make the request you're going to So it's an interesting thing but there's always been over the course of all the years that they've been open that there are families who asked to go to one school or another and

1182
01:37:59,588 --> 01:38:02,790
[SPEAKER_57]: Right, who are in the know to write a letter or an email.

1183
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:07,513
[SPEAKER_57]: But when you go to register your child, it doesn't say you get to choose the elementary school you want to go to.

1184
01:38:07,573 --> 01:38:10,275
[SPEAKER_57]: They say to me, you live on Morgan Ave, you go to the Roberts.

1185
01:38:10,595 --> 01:38:17,100
[SPEAKER_57]: And unless you are informed or active on Facebook Medford Moms, you don't know that you can choose what school to go to.

1186
01:38:17,700 --> 01:38:30,244
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I guess it's been less of a drive for people to do that, but over the years, I can assure you people came in frequently asking to go to one school or the other.

1187
01:38:30,424 --> 01:38:39,026
[SPEAKER_57]: Right, but if we are, for middle school you would get a choice, one or two, but we don't get that for elementary school.

1188
01:38:39,066 --> 01:38:42,067
[SPEAKER_57]: I'm just saying then why do we give a choice at the middle school?

1189
01:38:43,415 --> 01:38:48,956
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, then you would have a situation where certain sections of the city would populate one school and some would populate the other school.

1190
01:38:49,116 --> 01:38:53,397
[SPEAKER_57]: Not if we do a random lottery for kids going to middle school.

1191
01:38:53,457 --> 01:38:54,637
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, then no one gets a choice.

1192
01:38:54,657 --> 01:38:56,037
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what I mean?

1193
01:38:56,057 --> 01:38:59,878
[SPEAKER_27]: So, this trade-off, so all of these systems, for the most part it's worked.

1194
01:38:59,918 --> 01:39:02,699
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a year where we have one real aberration.

1195
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:07,980
[SPEAKER_27]: If you look at the rest of the enrollment at the Andrews and the McGlynn, it's within a few students of each other.

1196
01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:09,620
[SPEAKER_57]: No, because you said,

1197
01:39:10,294 --> 01:39:14,035
[SPEAKER_57]: back, McGlynn used to be the choice school, and they had over-enrollment, so it's.

1198
01:39:14,195 --> 01:39:15,215
[SPEAKER_41]: But not to this level.

1199
01:39:16,055 --> 01:39:17,215
[SPEAKER_27]: Not at this level.

1200
01:39:17,455 --> 01:39:19,336
[SPEAKER_27]: This is an aberration this particular year.

1201
01:39:20,296 --> 01:39:21,016
[SPEAKER_54]: Point of information.

1202
01:39:21,036 --> 01:39:36,159
[SPEAKER_54]: Yeah, point of information on this was that the choice of elementary schools really came into place when we were building the so-called new schools now, because we were going from our neighborhood schools to the larger schools.

1203
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:38,720
[SPEAKER_54]: And because we also did it in a phase way,

1204
01:39:39,858 --> 01:39:51,861
[SPEAKER_54]: We had parents that felt that they wanted to wait that extra year either in their neighborhood school, and then it got to a point where because one school was built before the other, that's how the choices came.

1205
01:39:52,321 --> 01:39:58,923
[SPEAKER_54]: But over the years now, I know that like the last 12 years that I've been here, what's happened is we've kind of

1206
01:39:59,803 --> 01:40:27,672
[SPEAKER_54]: it's always an option, maybe it's not publicized, and maybe the reason we haven't really done that is because there was other complications that come with it too, is that people that started with that, so we've always honored the siblings, if they were on one side and they went to another school, we've honored that, we've honored other things that people knew about, but we also have to take into consideration the buses, we have to take into consideration that as before, you don't want to have one school really to the max,

1207
01:40:28,572 --> 01:40:41,620
[SPEAKER_54]: And you kind of do want to leave I know our schools are in a different type of neighborhood But parents have actually opted to stay within the system or within their district I should say within their neighborhood.

1208
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:50,626
[SPEAKER_54]: Let's say in a larger in a larger way when it came to the middle school it was always more of a choice and I think that's how that's the reason we've gone that way and

1209
01:40:51,006 --> 01:40:52,627
[SPEAKER_54]: So it's gonna camp it's together.

1210
01:40:53,207 --> 01:41:05,033
[SPEAKER_54]: So they started off that way, but then over the years it wasn't like we said No, it wouldn't happen if you wanted to pick a different one But we highly advise parents, you know Where are you living?

1211
01:41:05,614 --> 01:41:13,178
[SPEAKER_54]: You know your social life and and as miss Caldwell said, you know if you're going to work or things like that whereas you're

1212
01:41:14,338 --> 01:41:19,282
[SPEAKER_54]: I mean, we've had situations because our children, some of the children have decided to go to the McGlynn Middle School.

1213
01:41:19,962 --> 01:41:24,986
[SPEAKER_54]: Their children stayed in the McGlynn Elementary School because that's, it was a better thing for them.

1214
01:41:25,066 --> 01:41:34,794
[SPEAKER_54]: But, I mean, I don't remember in the last few years that we've actually gone out there and publicized that there's a huge choice, and I think it's done because of other expenses that are involved, too.

1215
01:41:35,294 --> 01:41:39,838
[SPEAKER_54]: But with that being said, if parents have called, they have been given that choice.

1216
01:41:44,629 --> 01:41:53,215
[SPEAKER_32]: I want to address this question in particular because I had a number of parents say that they weren't able to get into the school of their choice.

1217
01:41:53,655 --> 01:41:54,776
[SPEAKER_32]: This happened to me twice now.

1218
01:41:55,096 --> 01:41:55,296
[SPEAKER_32]: Right.

1219
01:41:55,356 --> 01:41:59,379
[SPEAKER_32]: There was a school that was closer to them and one parent was so outraged

1220
01:41:59,919 --> 01:42:03,963
[SPEAKER_32]: that they were like, oh, if Medford is gonna treat me this way, I'm gonna take my kids to a private school.

1221
01:42:04,003 --> 01:42:04,864
[SPEAKER_55]: Elementary or middle?

1222
01:42:05,424 --> 01:42:07,426
[SPEAKER_55]: Elementary.

1223
01:42:07,806 --> 01:42:10,629
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just want to know what percent does this happen?

1224
01:42:11,289 --> 01:42:14,592
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I mean, you know, I've only heard one side of the story or...

1225
01:42:16,125 --> 01:42:20,226
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I think that there were a few situations where we were concerned about class size.

1226
01:42:21,066 --> 01:42:25,928
[SPEAKER_27]: And so there was some desire that maybe we should move people to one school or the other.

1227
01:42:26,348 --> 01:42:29,829
[SPEAKER_27]: Some cases, it could be transportation situations that were in there.

1228
01:42:29,869 --> 01:42:30,969
[SPEAKER_27]: But Diane, you may want to.

1229
01:42:31,389 --> 01:42:33,150
[SPEAKER_40]: No, it's usually.

1230
01:42:33,978 --> 01:42:35,918
[SPEAKER_40]: We usually look at class size issues.

1231
01:42:36,019 --> 01:42:43,460
[SPEAKER_40]: And when we have kindergartens or different grade levels that begin to fill up, we certainly don't want to put additional students in that school.

1232
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:51,982
[SPEAKER_40]: So if, for instance, there was a child and one of the classes was only 17 or 19 students, we would accommodate.

1233
01:42:52,063 --> 01:42:53,783
[SPEAKER_40]: And in the past, we have accommodated them.

1234
01:42:54,514 --> 01:43:02,478
[SPEAKER_55]: But I think your question is someone that lives in that school district neighborhood, whatever we want to refer to it as, didn't get to go to that school.

1235
01:43:02,558 --> 01:43:03,258
[SPEAKER_55]: That's not true.

1236
01:43:03,298 --> 01:43:04,038
[SPEAKER_40]: I haven't heard of that at all.

1237
01:43:04,058 --> 01:43:04,959
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not someone in the neighborhood.

1238
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:13,382
[SPEAKER_40]: No, if they're designated, for instance, if it's a Brooks School student, and in their designated neighborhood, they all went to that school.

1239
01:43:13,402 --> 01:43:14,083
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes, that's what I thought.

1240
01:43:14,103 --> 01:43:14,383
[SPEAKER_32]: It's probably.

1241
01:43:14,403 --> 01:43:15,663
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, they have fresh choice.

1242
01:43:16,144 --> 01:43:21,806
[SPEAKER_32]: There was the way the district lines worked out, that they were closer to one, but they weren't, they requested.

1243
01:43:21,886 --> 01:43:23,547
[SPEAKER_32]: I just want to get a sense of what percentage

1244
01:43:24,247 --> 01:43:28,851
[SPEAKER_32]: What was the last time you redistricted?

1245
01:43:28,911 --> 01:43:29,771
[SPEAKER_57]: One at a time please.

1246
01:43:31,012 --> 01:43:31,713
[SPEAKER_27]: Long time ago.

1247
01:43:31,733 --> 01:43:32,934
[SPEAKER_27]: Long time ago.

1248
01:43:33,134 --> 01:43:34,895
[SPEAKER_55]: When we opened the schools probably.

1249
01:43:35,216 --> 01:43:40,900
[SPEAKER_27]: There was one redistricting that took place probably three or four years in and that's it.

1250
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:41,881
[SPEAKER_50]: It's been a while.

1251
01:43:43,522 --> 01:43:45,384
[SPEAKER_50]: Mr. Benedetto?

1252
01:43:45,924 --> 01:43:47,645
[SPEAKER_50]: So I think I live in that neighborhood.

1253
01:43:49,112 --> 01:43:55,617
[SPEAKER_50]: that it used to be like North Street, and it used to be Winthrop Street over, you go to the Brooks, and then they redistricted it.

1254
01:43:56,177 --> 01:44:07,406
[SPEAKER_50]: And I didn't realize at the time it had been redistricted, so when people were talking to me, this was prior to me being on this committee, I was like, yeah, you just go down the street to the Brooks.

1255
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:12,329
[SPEAKER_50]: But they had redistricted it, so it went to North Street, went to the Brooks.

1256
01:44:12,349 --> 01:44:12,950
[SPEAKER_50]: It was a Columbus.

1257
01:44:13,915 --> 01:44:28,222
[SPEAKER_50]: from North Street over was redistricted to the Columbus School, which wasn't as close, and where some people, like on my street, would have been able to walk their children to school, now live much further.

1258
01:44:28,722 --> 01:44:31,883
[SPEAKER_50]: So I think that's more what the concern was.

1259
01:44:31,963 --> 01:44:41,688
[SPEAKER_50]: And I have heard people in the Hillside area make comments like, I could walk my child every day, but I can't, it's too far.

1260
01:44:42,822 --> 01:44:49,704
[SPEAKER_50]: but now I have to bus them or bring them, and it's because of that last redistricting.

1261
01:44:50,264 --> 01:44:52,545
[SPEAKER_32]: It's possible that there's a miscommunication.

1262
01:44:52,565 --> 01:45:04,369
[SPEAKER_32]: I'll talk to the parent and see if we can forward that information to you guys, but it was that exact issue, that she could walk it, but now she can't walk, and she was very frustrated at the response she received from the school district.

1263
01:45:04,749 --> 01:45:05,910
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm sure it was just a miscommunication.

1264
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:08,190
[SPEAKER_27]: So let me give you a little bit on that too, just to think about it.

1265
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:09,091
[SPEAKER_27]: When the schools were built,

1266
01:45:10,621 --> 01:45:18,709
[SPEAKER_27]: The two schools that sort of had a lock on the Brooks were the Dame and the Irving and Gleason.

1267
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:22,293
[SPEAKER_27]: Those were the three, but there was a whole portion of people that went to the Dame.

1268
01:45:23,252 --> 01:45:28,914
[SPEAKER_27]: that we needed to take to the Columbus because we would have had the Columbus even more underpopulated than it is today.

1269
01:45:29,674 --> 01:45:41,118
[SPEAKER_27]: So there was a need to make a division on that side of the river and move it towards the Columbus or else we would have had an underpopulated school in South Medford and an overpopulated school in West Medford.

1270
01:45:41,538 --> 01:45:43,499
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was the sort of divide there.

1271
01:45:43,579 --> 01:45:47,381
[SPEAKER_27]: And of course with busing transportation, we felt it was very doable.

1272
01:45:48,022 --> 01:45:49,362
[SPEAKER_27]: So that was the thinking at the time.

1273
01:45:49,603 --> 01:45:55,566
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, it's not that, I don't think there was any malfeasance or practice on anyone's part, it was just a question of miscommunication.

1274
01:45:56,026 --> 01:46:04,291
[SPEAKER_32]: And I just wanted to get a sense of how often that happens for parents, because as well, many parents don't think that they do have a choice, at least in my experience when talking to them.

1275
01:46:04,331 --> 01:46:08,073
[SPEAKER_50]: So just to follow up, as a committee member, I do hear that as well.

1276
01:46:11,976 --> 01:46:19,122
[SPEAKER_41]: So, when we did it, it was very unpopular and there were many, many parents who were extremely concerned.

1277
01:46:20,142 --> 01:46:25,387
[SPEAKER_41]: One of the things which now is I hear so many positive things.

1278
01:46:25,987 --> 01:46:39,814
[SPEAKER_41]: about the Columbus that I think that parents, I've not heard anywhere near the level of concern because once people go and meet Mrs. K, they're so happy and the school is such a positive place to be.

1279
01:46:40,375 --> 01:46:44,757
[SPEAKER_41]: So I just haven't heard that level.

1280
01:46:45,978 --> 01:46:50,720
[SPEAKER_41]: The ugliest word of being a school committee member is probably redistricting.

1281
01:46:51,381 --> 01:46:51,901
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, really?

1282
01:46:52,561 --> 01:47:13,283
[SPEAKER_41]: positive and you know Mia you nearly took my breath away when you said why don't we just do a lottery and have them do that well that might be something we're gonna talk about but we're gonna make a lot of people unhappy no matter what we do when we talk about this type of things of equity between choice in schools it's a very difficult thing as a school committee member because we are naturally people who want to please

1283
01:47:14,368 --> 01:47:21,214
[SPEAKER_41]: And unfortunately, when you make that type of decision, you're gonna not make everybody, it's impossible to make everybody happy.

1284
01:47:21,254 --> 01:47:30,142
[SPEAKER_41]: So what we have to concentrate on is we have to look at the total population of kids and say, what is the most equitable thing for our student body?

1285
01:47:30,443 --> 01:47:31,624
[SPEAKER_41]: And how are we making sure?

1286
01:47:31,744 --> 01:47:35,788
[SPEAKER_41]: And one of the things is when you go into those school buildings, you will see

1287
01:47:36,348 --> 01:47:54,843
[SPEAKER_41]: that they all have the same, they have a gym, they have a library, they have a, because we were so concerned at the time of building them, that wherever a student in Medford went, that they would have an equitable building and environment to learn in, and also populate as close as we can with the same kind of draws.

1288
01:47:55,704 --> 01:48:02,750
[SPEAKER_41]: This is, when I've been on the committee, the McGlynn at one point was more popular, and then it became the Andrews, and then it became the McGlynn.

1289
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:09,477
[SPEAKER_41]: We've never had such an inequity as we did this year, and hopefully we won't again.

1290
01:48:09,798 --> 01:48:12,881
[SPEAKER_41]: But we clearly have to take steps this year to look at it.

1291
01:48:13,262 --> 01:48:17,246
[SPEAKER_41]: And in the meantime, my concern is the well-being of the students who didn't want to go.

1292
01:48:18,167 --> 01:48:26,389
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, the parents I spoke with, I have to talk with them obviously, but I'll forward you the information if they agree, they felt they were sort of pushed into the Columbus.

1293
01:48:27,029 --> 01:48:33,931
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think that that was just, whether it was the reality or the perception, maybe it's a question of just clearing it up.

1294
01:48:33,951 --> 01:48:37,772
[SPEAKER_41]: We don't want to have one school which has 300 kids in one school.

1295
01:48:37,832 --> 01:48:39,012
[SPEAKER_32]: And that's the challenge, of course.

1296
01:48:39,392 --> 01:48:40,292
[SPEAKER_55]: Very good, thanks Mike.

1297
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:40,912
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1298
01:48:40,932 --> 01:48:43,993
[SPEAKER_55]: Is there a motion to receive this paper and place it on file?

1299
01:48:44,033 --> 01:48:44,413
[SPEAKER_50]: So moved.

1300
01:48:44,793 --> 01:48:47,414
[SPEAKER_50]: I just had a question, if you don't mind.

1301
01:48:48,314 --> 01:48:55,280
[SPEAKER_50]: It was about Study Island, how much that costs, and why has Andrews had it for a while and McGlennaught?

1302
01:48:57,282 --> 01:49:12,694
[SPEAKER_28]: Study Island, Mr. DeLava had put that in his regular budget for several years because he wanted to have that reading instruction to be delivered in terms of the RTI.

1303
01:49:13,935 --> 01:49:19,639
[SPEAKER_28]: Because of the way the scheduling was done, that wasn't done the same way at McGlynn, there was not the need for it.

1304
01:49:19,699 --> 01:49:22,241
[SPEAKER_28]: We said we have to do it differently, okay?

1305
01:49:22,261 --> 01:49:28,946
[SPEAKER_28]: We need to make sure that the two schools are doing RTI and that they have the materials that they need.

1306
01:49:29,446 --> 01:49:33,949
[SPEAKER_28]: Study Island for both math, it's a very good diagnostic tool.

1307
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:38,732
[SPEAKER_28]: For both of them we were able to, I think we're under like $4,000 at the McGlynn.

1308
01:49:41,414 --> 01:49:49,577
[SPEAKER_28]: What we did at budget time, we did include it at the McGlynn budget, but then we were able to get this new grant this summer that paid for it.

1309
01:49:50,077 --> 01:49:54,038
[SPEAKER_28]: So we could put the money back in and probably use it for stipends for clubs, so.

1310
01:49:54,758 --> 01:50:09,283
[SPEAKER_50]: Okay, at budget time, we heard from people that RTI was extremely important, and a few committee members were really focused on this as being a budget item, and now it wasn't,

1311
01:50:10,743 --> 01:50:13,907
[SPEAKER_50]: At budget time, and now we're purchasing stuff.

1312
01:50:13,947 --> 01:50:20,115
[SPEAKER_50]: We talked about staff maybe for RTI, and there was talk about using people in

1313
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:22,730
[SPEAKER_28]: That's elementary.

1314
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:31,395
[SPEAKER_28]: The middle school, Dr. Chiesa had put the study island in her English budget for the McGlynn because she knew it was used at the Andrews very effectively.

1315
01:50:31,915 --> 01:50:39,680
[SPEAKER_28]: But again, we can throw that money back into something else because we have this brand new Title IV-A grant that we can support that.

1316
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:43,422
[SPEAKER_28]: The plan was to have it at the McGlynn this year, okay?

1317
01:50:43,902 --> 01:50:47,244
[SPEAKER_50]: Great, so my other comment is about the clubs.

1318
01:50:48,705 --> 01:51:01,614
[SPEAKER_50]: Now, Mr. DeLaver has been here for years asking more and more money for the clubs because they're so popular and because it makes the children feel a part of that community and the social piece is so important.

1319
01:51:01,634 --> 01:51:04,956
[SPEAKER_50]: And I think that is a big draw for the middle schoolers.

1320
01:51:05,296 --> 01:51:09,159
[SPEAKER_50]: And I remember either myself or someone else asking

1321
01:51:10,335 --> 01:51:14,217
[SPEAKER_50]: Why can't we open it up to the McGlen kids and have them go back and forth?

1322
01:51:14,437 --> 01:51:20,600
[SPEAKER_50]: He said they've tried it on a few occasions if I remember correctly I wish he was here and that it really doesn't always work

1323
01:51:21,832 --> 01:51:25,496
[SPEAKER_50]: So I just want to make sure that we figure out a way that it does work.

1324
01:51:25,916 --> 01:51:34,505
[SPEAKER_50]: And I want not only the McGlynn kids to go over to Andrews to take part, I want some really cool things at the McGlynn that draws those kids over.

1325
01:51:34,745 --> 01:51:40,832
[SPEAKER_50]: Because I really want, you know, the McGlynn has a little bit more space with them, you know.

1326
01:51:41,177 --> 01:51:55,605
[SPEAKER_28]: In talking to the principals, one of the issues with having the kids, let's say from the McGlynn, go to a club at the Andrews, is just we have to make sure the safety issue, that the kids are, because they're not as well known in the school.

1327
01:51:55,925 --> 01:52:02,849
[SPEAKER_28]: So we have to make sure we have systems in place that those kids, they're supposed to be coming over from the McGlynn, they're truly there, okay?

1328
01:52:02,889 --> 01:52:06,851
[SPEAKER_28]: And that was the concern that they identified this past week.

1329
01:52:09,164 --> 01:52:16,851
[SPEAKER_50]: Could it be housed at the McGlynn?

1330
01:52:17,612 --> 01:52:18,273
[SPEAKER_50]: Or not?

1331
01:52:18,353 --> 01:52:22,757
[SPEAKER_50]: Because the McGlynn has the auditorium.

1332
01:52:23,838 --> 01:52:25,440
[SPEAKER_28]: The teacher is at the Andrews.

1333
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,522
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess that's how that happened, the teacher that runs it.

1334
01:52:27,582 --> 01:52:28,803
[SPEAKER_28]: But the McGlynn has...

1335
01:52:30,722 --> 01:52:53,111
[SPEAKER_28]: It's after school and the McGlynn has the talent show though, so I mean they both have you know structures in place for the arts It's just different Okay, but we but we can like I said that one that one student again the father wrote me an email the students at the McGlynn But she'd like to participate in the drama because that's her her real passion and we're working to get her over there.

1336
01:52:53,471 --> 01:52:53,651
[SPEAKER_28]: So I

1337
01:52:54,230 --> 01:52:57,992
[SPEAKER_50]: So I'm sure there's other children as well, and I would like it open to them as well.

1338
01:52:59,093 --> 01:53:00,513
[SPEAKER_41]: Mayor Burke.

1339
01:53:00,614 --> 01:53:03,755
[SPEAKER_41]: I think there's a reality that needs to be mentioned.

1340
01:53:06,077 --> 01:53:07,277
[SPEAKER_41]: The teacher is extraordinary.

1341
01:53:07,657 --> 01:53:11,780
[SPEAKER_41]: She does an extraordinary job getting all of those students onto the stage.

1342
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:16,361
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't know if there's room one inch that is not covered by.

1343
01:53:16,641 --> 01:53:18,301
[SPEAKER_57]: She had a hundred last year.

1344
01:53:18,401 --> 01:53:18,601
[SPEAKER_41]: Right.

1345
01:53:18,881 --> 01:53:26,303
[SPEAKER_41]: So either we convince her and she would probably kill her because she's also to do it at the other school as well.

1346
01:53:26,903 --> 01:53:39,566
[SPEAKER_41]: Or we have someone else run a drama program at the McGlynn that's equally popular because to just say, okay, every student, if you know, I understand the student that you're talking about,

1347
01:53:40,026 --> 01:53:46,908
[SPEAKER_41]: But, frankly, airing this, I bet tomorrow morning you're going to have 25 calls of kids who hear this.

1348
01:53:47,948 --> 01:53:49,829
[SPEAKER_28]: I won't be in tomorrow, Mr. Superintendent.

1349
01:53:51,409 --> 01:53:55,210
[SPEAKER_41]: So perhaps we have to think about running a drama program, you know.

1350
01:53:56,350 --> 01:54:02,192
[SPEAKER_28]: We have some new music teachers, I know that, that we hired, and I'll talk to Mrs. Igney about maybe doing that.

1351
01:54:03,172 --> 01:54:04,553
[SPEAKER_28]: The teacher is extraordinary.

1352
01:54:05,153 --> 01:54:05,853
[SPEAKER_28]: She's amazing.

1353
01:54:06,573 --> 01:54:13,356
[SPEAKER_28]: I was at the farmer's market in North Andover on a Sunday last week and it's Mrs. Nelson, Mrs. Nelson, there she was volunteering up there.

1354
01:54:13,416 --> 01:54:14,696
[SPEAKER_28]: So she's extraordinary.

1355
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:18,898
[SPEAKER_27]: So I know that some people might disagree with this, but I'm going to say it anyway.

1356
01:54:19,798 --> 01:54:25,780
[SPEAKER_27]: This is that when one school draws a little bit more than the other school, the other school has to want to compete.

1357
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,361
[SPEAKER_27]: The other school has to want to

1358
01:54:28,362 --> 01:54:38,772
[SPEAKER_27]: pick up the energy and to try and find ways to bring people, because they should take pride in their development and making some things happen instead of saying, oh, I don't know what was made.

1359
01:54:39,152 --> 01:54:40,714
[SPEAKER_27]: I think there's a certain amount of that.

1360
01:54:40,734 --> 01:54:42,515
[SPEAKER_27]: And I've said this to some of you as we've talked.

1361
01:54:42,916 --> 01:54:46,799
[SPEAKER_27]: The culture at one place is not as energetic as the culture at the other.

1362
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:48,461
[SPEAKER_27]: And we've got to change that.

1363
01:54:48,501 --> 01:54:51,764
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's part of the reasons why we made some of the changes we made.

1364
01:54:52,425 --> 01:54:53,265
[SPEAKER_27]: Sending a message.

1365
01:54:53,946 --> 01:54:55,027
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's the way you do it.

1366
01:54:55,067 --> 01:54:55,847
[SPEAKER_27]: You have to do it.

1367
01:54:56,307 --> 01:55:03,892
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, when we talked about in the past, McGlynn was taking over the place and the Andrews was falling backwards after a number of years.

1368
01:55:04,152 --> 01:55:06,253
[SPEAKER_27]: And we sent a message and we changed some things.

1369
01:55:06,293 --> 01:55:11,776
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's not perfect, but it's an attempt to send a message and say, come on, you want to be

1370
01:55:13,197 --> 01:55:17,023
[SPEAKER_27]: The school of choice, you want to bring people to you, and you've got to step it up a little bit.

1371
01:55:17,403 --> 01:55:21,710
[SPEAKER_27]: And that happens, it happens in sports, it happens in the arts, it happens in academics.

1372
01:55:22,211 --> 01:55:26,938
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't believe in competition as the only way of doing it, but sometimes there's a little competition that's useful.

1373
01:55:27,658 --> 01:55:31,943
[SPEAKER_57]: With the federal funding, you said they had to be schools with a similar student population.

1374
01:55:31,963 --> 01:55:32,263
[SPEAKER_27]: Not federal.

1375
01:55:33,044 --> 01:55:33,905
[SPEAKER_57]: What did you say about that?

1376
01:55:33,985 --> 01:55:34,466
[SPEAKER_57]: Oh, state.

1377
01:55:34,706 --> 01:55:35,867
[SPEAKER_57]: State, sorry, not federal.

1378
01:55:36,288 --> 01:55:39,791
[SPEAKER_57]: But how does the Andrews have 20% low and reduced?

1379
01:55:39,811 --> 01:55:42,775
[SPEAKER_27]: It didn't have to be the same population, it had to be within ranges.

1380
01:55:43,235 --> 01:55:46,279
[SPEAKER_57]: But 20% to 44% for that subgroup is pretty big.

1381
01:55:46,379 --> 01:55:47,140
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a change.

1382
01:55:47,260 --> 01:55:51,004
[SPEAKER_27]: And because part of it is the growth of the Yale population has changed a lot.

1383
01:55:51,024 --> 01:55:54,428
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, that was not as significant years ago.

1384
01:55:54,868 --> 01:55:55,789
[SPEAKER_27]: It's now significant.

1385
01:55:55,829 --> 01:55:57,952
[SPEAKER_27]: It's now emerged and it will continue to emerge.

1386
01:55:58,432 --> 01:55:59,634
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's a new challenge for us.

1387
01:56:00,955 --> 01:56:01,896
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a new challenge for us.

1388
01:56:02,236 --> 01:56:04,658
[SPEAKER_27]: But again, you know, we work at these things.

1389
01:56:04,718 --> 01:56:07,060
[SPEAKER_27]: And, you know, every year there's going to be challenges.

1390
01:56:07,080 --> 01:56:07,720
[SPEAKER_27]: This is one of them.

1391
01:56:08,261 --> 01:56:09,041
[SPEAKER_27]: And we'll make it work.

1392
01:56:09,081 --> 01:56:09,602
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll get on it.

1393
01:56:09,642 --> 01:56:10,762
[SPEAKER_27]: We've got a lot of things moving.

1394
01:56:11,003 --> 01:56:11,983
[SPEAKER_27]: We've talked about a lot.

1395
01:56:12,023 --> 01:56:14,465
[SPEAKER_27]: We're certainly not being satisfied about it.

1396
01:56:15,086 --> 01:56:16,247
[SPEAKER_27]: We're saying, let's go make it happen.

1397
01:56:16,287 --> 01:56:17,768
[SPEAKER_27]: But we need everybody on board.

1398
01:56:18,328 --> 01:56:21,571
[SPEAKER_27]: It can't be, woe is me, you know, they did something to me.

1399
01:56:22,271 --> 01:56:23,112
[SPEAKER_27]: They've got to step up too.

1400
01:56:23,352 --> 01:56:23,492
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

1401
01:56:23,512 --> 01:56:24,032
[SPEAKER_41]: Van der Kloot.

1402
01:56:24,152 --> 01:56:27,855
[SPEAKER_41]: I just had one more question a little bit back to earlier in your report.

1403
01:56:28,175 --> 01:56:30,076
[SPEAKER_41]: You mentioned to us the teacher changes.

1404
01:56:30,897 --> 01:56:37,501
[SPEAKER_41]: And I'm wondering if that's because, were the teachers willing to do that?

1405
01:56:38,282 --> 01:56:41,744
[SPEAKER_41]: Are we going to see grievances at some point?

1406
01:56:41,804 --> 01:56:42,345
[SPEAKER_41]: I just wondered.

1407
01:56:43,908 --> 01:56:46,529
[SPEAKER_28]: We did not change any one subject they taught.

1408
01:56:46,849 --> 01:56:48,050
[SPEAKER_28]: We changed grade levels.

1409
01:56:49,210 --> 01:56:51,771
[SPEAKER_28]: No one likes change, quite honestly.

1410
01:56:52,151 --> 01:56:55,193
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, we exhibited some resistance.

1411
01:56:55,333 --> 01:57:00,475
[SPEAKER_28]: But again, we didn't put an English teacher in a math class.

1412
01:57:01,245 --> 01:57:03,788
[SPEAKER_28]: And contractually, we have the ability to write.

1413
01:57:04,808 --> 01:57:08,652
[SPEAKER_28]: The middle school, you know, I taught middle school for 23 years, okay?

1414
01:57:08,772 --> 01:57:12,736
[SPEAKER_28]: And I, you know, I was at the Roberts for 13 years.

1415
01:57:12,796 --> 01:57:15,939
[SPEAKER_28]: And all of a sudden, what was the superintendent said, you have to go to the Lincoln.

1416
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:17,120
[SPEAKER_28]: Was I happy?

1417
01:57:17,541 --> 01:57:18,722
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I was not happy.

1418
01:57:19,122 --> 01:57:20,543
[SPEAKER_28]: Was I fine when I got there?

1419
01:57:20,603 --> 01:57:21,824
[SPEAKER_28]: Was I a better teacher?

1420
01:57:22,404 --> 01:57:23,085
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolutely.

1421
01:57:23,545 --> 01:57:31,131
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that the middle school is the only level of teaching where a person could conceivably stay in the same job year after year.

1422
01:57:31,491 --> 01:57:34,073
[SPEAKER_28]: Elementary teachers go from grade to grade.

1423
01:57:34,573 --> 01:57:36,835
[SPEAKER_28]: High school teachers teach different subjects.

1424
01:57:36,935 --> 01:57:40,097
[SPEAKER_28]: Every year you might be a world history teacher, then you might be a U.S.

1425
01:57:40,117 --> 01:57:40,678
[SPEAKER_28]: history teacher.

1426
01:57:41,538 --> 01:57:48,440
[SPEAKER_28]: In rethinking all of this, quite honestly, what perhaps we should have learned, we went from the three middle schools to the two.

1427
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:54,421
[SPEAKER_28]: I spent that summer drying tears how this person couldn't possibly teach without their teammate.

1428
01:57:55,042 --> 01:58:01,783
[SPEAKER_28]: And I said to people, if you feel this strongly after a year, come back and see me and we'll think about moving you back.

1429
01:58:02,264 --> 01:58:03,404
[SPEAKER_28]: No one came back to see me.

1430
01:58:04,184 --> 01:58:05,627
[SPEAKER_28]: I think change is healthy.

1431
01:58:05,667 --> 01:58:15,542
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's very healthy for a teacher who's an 8th grade teacher to be a 7th grade teacher because that 8th grade teacher knows what a 7th grade student has to do to get to 8th grade.

1432
01:58:16,203 --> 01:58:19,268
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think it's very healthy and we're not asking them to teach

1433
01:58:19,768 --> 01:58:21,930
[SPEAKER_28]: outside of their license, their content area.

1434
01:58:22,570 --> 01:58:23,991
[SPEAKER_28]: There were needs in that school.

1435
01:58:24,091 --> 01:58:25,993
[SPEAKER_28]: We had a brand new reading teacher.

1436
01:58:26,433 --> 01:58:29,636
[SPEAKER_28]: She needed veteran English teachers to support her.

1437
01:58:29,676 --> 01:58:35,340
[SPEAKER_28]: That new English teacher that was hired would not have been able to help her in the way the veteran teacher was.

1438
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:40,961
[SPEAKER_41]: I understand, I was just curious why you were making, you know, informing the committee specifically.

1439
01:58:40,981 --> 01:58:44,042
[SPEAKER_41]: I mean, obviously, it's useful for us to know, but I just was curious.

1440
01:58:44,062 --> 01:58:47,743
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, we want you to know what we did, because you might get phone calls, I'm sure.

1441
01:58:48,043 --> 01:58:48,283
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay.

1442
01:58:48,383 --> 01:58:53,884
[SPEAKER_28]: And Mr. Cieri came tonight because he wanted to speak if there was a question about the science.

1443
01:58:54,824 --> 01:58:58,285
[SPEAKER_28]: Obviously, we did this with his blessing and recommendation.

1444
01:58:58,825 --> 01:59:05,227
[SPEAKER_28]: Science frameworks are new, and he knows his people best, and that change was, again, for the best, are people happy?

1445
01:59:06,147 --> 01:59:07,948
[SPEAKER_28]: No one likes change, but you know what?

1446
01:59:08,148 --> 01:59:09,089
[SPEAKER_28]: It's healthy, it's good.

1447
01:59:09,149 --> 01:59:09,769
[SPEAKER_28]: I went through it.

1448
01:59:10,129 --> 01:59:12,050
[SPEAKER_28]: I was a better teacher.

1449
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:14,672
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought, how could I possibly leave my classroom in the Roberts?

1450
01:59:14,992 --> 01:59:17,353
[SPEAKER_28]: I could teach from my car by the time I got through.

1451
01:59:17,613 --> 01:59:20,895
[SPEAKER_28]: You just become more flexible and you meet new people and you get new ideas.

1452
01:59:21,255 --> 01:59:25,257
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's healthy, it's just not pleasant to go through initially.

1453
01:59:25,417 --> 01:59:26,218
[SPEAKER_41]: Okay, thanks.

1454
01:59:26,718 --> 01:59:27,018
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1455
01:59:29,826 --> 01:59:30,787
[SPEAKER_32]: One more question here.

1456
01:59:32,088 --> 01:59:40,356
[SPEAKER_32]: If a parent has trouble reading, perhaps, the form for admissions, what's the default school that they get sent to if they don't return the form to you?

1457
01:59:40,736 --> 01:59:42,758
[SPEAKER_32]: Is it that they get defaulted to McGlynn?

1458
01:59:43,058 --> 01:59:48,803
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, they were defaulted to the McGlynn now because that was the school that was essentially under-enrolled in the sixth grade.

1459
01:59:51,765 --> 01:59:52,185
[SPEAKER_55]: Very good.

1460
01:59:52,225 --> 01:59:55,726
[SPEAKER_55]: Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file?

1461
01:59:55,746 --> 01:59:56,147
[SPEAKER_55]: Second.

1462
01:59:56,187 --> 01:59:58,387
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

1463
01:59:58,407 --> 01:59:58,747
[SPEAKER_55]: Aye.

1464
01:59:58,928 --> 01:59:59,788
[SPEAKER_55]: All those opposed?

1465
01:59:59,868 --> 02:00:00,828
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

1466
02:00:01,949 --> 02:00:05,890
[SPEAKER_55]: Report on enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.

1467
02:00:06,870 --> 02:00:14,493
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is a report you asked for and it's timely because I'll be at the City Council tomorrow night and there's at least three motions on the agenda.

1468
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:17,103
[SPEAKER_27]: to ask me these questions, okay?

1469
02:00:17,744 --> 02:00:20,908
[SPEAKER_27]: But I think you should be very pleased when you look at the details here.

1470
02:00:20,948 --> 02:00:24,712
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm gonna go through it a little bit because I think it's really a significant report.

1471
02:00:25,513 --> 02:00:29,719
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's designed to show school enrollment impact of new real estate development in Medford.

1472
02:00:30,583 --> 02:00:36,129
[SPEAKER_27]: This report looks at eight real estate complexes that contain 150 units or more.

1473
02:00:36,729 --> 02:00:39,452
[SPEAKER_27]: We didn't look at the baby ones here and there because that would be too small.

1474
02:00:40,193 --> 02:00:48,802
[SPEAKER_27]: The attached chart identifies each complex and provides information on the total number of enrolled students and their distributions across each of our schools.

1475
02:00:50,125 --> 02:00:57,327
[SPEAKER_27]: The overall initial enrollment in our schools is 4,257 students, which is 54 students higher than last year at this time.

1476
02:00:57,787 --> 02:01:02,528
[SPEAKER_27]: This number is going to grow moderately as we get to October, because that's the way things happen.

1477
02:01:04,368 --> 02:01:07,249
[SPEAKER_27]: The total number of students living in these eight complexes is 105.

1478
02:01:08,789 --> 02:01:10,589
[SPEAKER_27]: Two of the students are in outside placements.

1479
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:17,031
[SPEAKER_27]: Overall, the enrollments from these eight complexes is 2.4% of our total school population.

1480
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:24,362
[SPEAKER_27]: Given existing class sizes and space capacity, the enrollment from these developments has no significant effect.

1481
02:01:25,442 --> 02:01:31,003
[SPEAKER_27]: The average class size of our elementary schools is 18.3 students in the regular education classrooms.

1482
02:01:31,723 --> 02:01:43,346
[SPEAKER_27]: I provided a chart that details the grade level distribution, another chart that looks at each school, a third chart that shows enrollment distribution by complex in school, and a fourth chart that shows the enrollment percentage by school.

1483
02:01:44,266 --> 02:01:50,188
[SPEAKER_27]: Our elementary schools could enroll an additional 500 students and still be within our contractual limits for class size.

1484
02:01:51,068 --> 02:01:59,511
[SPEAKER_27]: We could enroll an additional 155 students and still maintain an average class size below 20 students, given normal distributions.

1485
02:02:00,411 --> 02:02:03,252
[SPEAKER_27]: Our middle schools were built for 1,200 students.

1486
02:02:03,833 --> 02:02:04,513
[SPEAKER_27]: We currently have 937.

1487
02:02:06,333 --> 02:02:10,455
[SPEAKER_27]: Overall, our middle school class size in the four major course subjects is around 20 students.

1488
02:02:11,476 --> 02:02:15,461
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, our class size is excellent, but we have plenty of capacity.

1489
02:02:15,501 --> 02:02:17,123
[SPEAKER_27]: People say there's no capacity anymore.

1490
02:02:17,403 --> 02:02:20,066
[SPEAKER_27]: The new developments are going to swamp the schools.

1491
02:02:20,467 --> 02:02:21,088
[SPEAKER_27]: Not true.

1492
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:24,351
[SPEAKER_27]: The high school vocational program has room to grow.

1493
02:02:24,951 --> 02:02:28,593
[SPEAKER_27]: Space utilization could be adjusted if necessary to increase enrollment substantially.

1494
02:02:29,053 --> 02:02:33,656
[SPEAKER_27]: For example, moving the pre-K programs and offices would open up additional space in the future.

1495
02:02:34,356 --> 02:02:38,438
[SPEAKER_27]: If necessary, we can consider some redistricting to shift enrollment to the Columbus.

1496
02:02:38,958 --> 02:02:46,662
[SPEAKER_27]: The allocation of specialized spaces for small groups and services could be revisited to create more sections or more options as well.

1497
02:02:47,442 --> 02:02:55,664
[SPEAKER_27]: In conclusion, the data clearly indicates that the impact of major residential real estate development has not adversely impacted our schools.

1498
02:02:56,244 --> 02:02:57,705
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're going to take you to the first chart.

1499
02:03:00,725 --> 02:03:04,406
[SPEAKER_27]: You're looking at the eight big complexes.

1500
02:03:06,167 --> 02:03:10,548
[SPEAKER_27]: If you look at them and you see the numbers of families in the first column.

1501
02:03:11,200 --> 02:03:15,621
[SPEAKER_27]: So a family might have more than one kid, so that there would be less than the total number.

1502
02:03:16,001 --> 02:03:20,081
[SPEAKER_27]: So if you have 16 number students in 100 Rivers Ed Drive, you only have 11 families.

1503
02:03:20,101 --> 02:03:22,402
[SPEAKER_27]: Some families have more than one child.

1504
02:03:23,282 --> 02:03:24,982
[SPEAKER_27]: And so on and so forth.

1505
02:03:25,002 --> 02:03:28,103
[SPEAKER_27]: And some of these complexes have existed for some time.

1506
02:03:28,123 --> 02:03:28,863
[SPEAKER_27]: They're not brand new.

1507
02:03:29,443 --> 02:03:30,323
[SPEAKER_27]: They've been here for a while.

1508
02:03:30,943 --> 02:03:40,725
[SPEAKER_27]: So when you look at it, you're looking at 105 students impacting us at this point in time, and two of them are outside placements, and the distribution's pretty good.

1509
02:03:41,808 --> 02:03:42,869
[SPEAKER_27]: So let me go to the next chart.

1510
02:03:42,929 --> 02:03:45,351
[SPEAKER_57]: Can I just say, is Lumiere less than 150 units?

1511
02:03:45,471 --> 02:03:45,671
[SPEAKER_57]: No.

1512
02:03:46,852 --> 02:03:48,373
[SPEAKER_57]: So is Lumiere one of those addresses?

1513
02:03:48,393 --> 02:03:48,473
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1514
02:03:48,493 --> 02:03:49,854
[SPEAKER_57]: I just don't know what the address is.

1515
02:03:49,874 --> 02:03:52,876
[SPEAKER_55]: It's the third one, the 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1516
02:03:53,196 --> 02:03:53,617
[SPEAKER_55]: Is Lumiere?

1517
02:03:53,637 --> 02:03:55,378
[SPEAKER_55]: So there's nine students from Lumiere.

1518
02:03:55,598 --> 02:03:56,579
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, Lumiere.

1519
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,543
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, so you go to the next chart, and you look at grade level class sizes.

1520
02:04:02,403 --> 02:04:06,186
[SPEAKER_27]: All right, kindergarten, there are 16 teachers district wide, and the average class size is 18.4.

1521
02:04:06,226 --> 02:04:06,546
[SPEAKER_27]: In grade one, 18.8.

1522
02:04:10,535 --> 02:04:11,095
[SPEAKER_27]: In grade 2, 18.

1523
02:04:11,235 --> 02:04:12,616
[SPEAKER_27]: In grade 3, 17.7.

1524
02:04:13,336 --> 02:04:15,397
[SPEAKER_27]: In grade 4, 19.3.

1525
02:04:16,017 --> 02:04:17,537
[SPEAKER_27]: In grade 5, 17.7.

1526
02:04:18,798 --> 02:04:21,739
[SPEAKER_27]: Those class sizes are private school class sizes.

1527
02:04:22,939 --> 02:04:27,121
[SPEAKER_27]: There are very few school districts in this area that have class sizes that good.

1528
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:30,202
[SPEAKER_27]: You've done an excellent job supporting that.

1529
02:04:31,022 --> 02:04:34,423
[SPEAKER_27]: But anyone who tries to give you the impression that we're swamped and overcrowded,

1530
02:04:35,733 --> 02:04:37,835
[SPEAKER_27]: is misleading everyone, we're not.

1531
02:04:38,355 --> 02:04:41,478
[SPEAKER_57]: Can we just go back to the buildings, just because I don't know the addresses.

1532
02:04:41,678 --> 02:04:43,920
[SPEAKER_57]: So 100 Rivers Edge Drive, where's that?

1533
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:48,404
[SPEAKER_55]: Rivers Edge is along the Malden River, it runs from Wellington Station to Malden Station.

1534
02:04:48,564 --> 02:04:51,247
[SPEAKER_55]: It's a new development, it's commercial and residential.

1535
02:04:51,387 --> 02:04:52,468
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

1536
02:04:52,728 --> 02:04:54,690
[SPEAKER_57]: 3600 Mystic Valley Parkway, is that behind the old Mall?

1537
02:04:54,710 --> 02:04:54,790
[SPEAKER_57]: Yes.

1538
02:04:54,810 --> 02:04:54,910
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

1539
02:04:59,458 --> 02:05:01,719
[SPEAKER_57]: And that 3920 Mystic Valley Pathway?

1540
02:05:01,759 --> 02:05:07,320
[SPEAKER_55]: Those are the condos that are, those are directly behind, if you're on 16 looking at the mall to the right.

1541
02:05:08,120 --> 02:05:08,680
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm pretty sure.

1542
02:05:08,961 --> 02:05:09,721
[SPEAKER_55]: They're the condos.

1543
02:05:10,181 --> 02:05:10,501
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay.

1544
02:05:11,221 --> 02:05:11,901
[SPEAKER_55]: Cabot Road.

1545
02:05:12,501 --> 02:05:13,982
[SPEAKER_55]: That's down Wellington Circle as well.

1546
02:05:14,022 --> 02:05:20,543
[SPEAKER_55]: That's brand new, so this is just, it's probably, it's just beginning, it has its occupancy starting up.

1547
02:05:20,824 --> 02:05:21,144
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay.

1548
02:05:22,184 --> 02:05:24,685
[SPEAKER_57]: And then the boat that's station landing, and then Riverside Ave.

1549
02:05:24,885 --> 02:05:26,385
[SPEAKER_55]: That's the towers at Riverside Ave.

1550
02:05:27,353 --> 02:05:28,474
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that near?

1551
02:05:28,494 --> 02:05:29,355
[SPEAKER_27]: They've been there forever.

1552
02:05:29,675 --> 02:05:32,157
[SPEAKER_55]: The Alicante Rink, is that it?

1553
02:05:32,197 --> 02:05:34,499
[SPEAKER_55]: Yeah, so 1979 they've been there since.

1554
02:05:34,599 --> 02:05:48,111
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the things you need to think about about these things is that typically some young families might move in when they can afford, let's say, to live in a rental unit or a condo, as opposed to a full house at this point, given real estate prices.

1555
02:05:48,866 --> 02:05:50,648
[SPEAKER_27]: But when their families grow, they move out.

1556
02:05:51,148 --> 02:05:52,490
[SPEAKER_27]: They don't stay in these developments.

1557
02:05:52,530 --> 02:05:54,432
[SPEAKER_27]: They move out to houses or they move elsewhere.

1558
02:05:55,033 --> 02:06:04,142
[SPEAKER_27]: But we're gonna have to see what that does because basically, you know, as housing prices in Medford go up, some young families are not gonna be able to afford to come in here as a starter home.

1559
02:06:05,163 --> 02:06:05,503
[SPEAKER_50]: Excuse me.

1560
02:06:05,523 --> 02:06:06,103
[SPEAKER_50]: Mr. Benedetto?

1561
02:06:06,243 --> 02:06:20,426
[SPEAKER_55]: As far as buildings, what are the buildings, you know, when you go down 9th Street at the end, there's a new... That's the one that, the five cabin is the brand new one that's having like a ribbon cutting in a week or so, but they have started their occupancy.

1562
02:06:20,766 --> 02:06:24,527
[SPEAKER_55]: The one before the train tracks, they're under 150 units.

1563
02:06:25,067 --> 02:06:26,827
[SPEAKER_55]: He looked at 150 as a threshold.

1564
02:06:26,847 --> 02:06:29,348
[SPEAKER_50]: Okay, so all the condo buildings on 8th, 9th and...

1565
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:35,822
[SPEAKER_50]: all those buildings are not included in any of these lists.

1566
02:06:36,002 --> 02:06:37,443
[SPEAKER_50]: Those are existing, those are existing.

1567
02:06:37,463 --> 02:06:38,723
[SPEAKER_50]: They've been there for a while.

1568
02:06:38,963 --> 02:06:41,165
[SPEAKER_50]: It's just that apartment complex at the very end.

1569
02:06:41,205 --> 02:06:42,425
[SPEAKER_27]: It looks like it's more than that.

1570
02:06:42,445 --> 02:06:45,947
[SPEAKER_27]: The other thing you need to know, look at the total distribution in the schools.

1571
02:06:47,188 --> 02:06:51,750
[SPEAKER_27]: Even if I didn't include a building, your class sizes are still low.

1572
02:06:51,790 --> 02:06:56,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Your numbers are still low, so that even if we added another building, it wouldn't have impacted it.

1573
02:06:56,933 --> 02:06:57,694
[SPEAKER_55]: So could I?

1574
02:06:57,894 --> 02:07:01,416
[SPEAKER_55]: Really, for a true comparison, you should be looking at the Rivers Edge Drive.

1575
02:07:01,896 --> 02:07:02,757
[SPEAKER_55]: That's brand new.

1576
02:07:02,837 --> 02:07:07,800
[SPEAKER_55]: It's apartments that are built, you know, they haven't been existing for a very long time.

1577
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:09,761
[SPEAKER_55]: And the station landing would be next up.

1578
02:07:10,122 --> 02:07:11,903
[SPEAKER_55]: And they were put in in 2004.

1579
02:07:12,583 --> 02:07:15,505
[SPEAKER_55]: But they were part of like transit development, smaller units.

1580
02:07:16,126 --> 02:07:20,989
[SPEAKER_55]: So those are probably the ones I would be looking at, but comparable about going forward.

1581
02:07:21,229 --> 02:07:30,832
[SPEAKER_50]: So I did request this report, and it's because of future building, and if we have the baseline now that we know where we're at, I have no problem with this.

1582
02:07:30,912 --> 02:07:38,095
[SPEAKER_50]: The only data that's not on here that I would like from the census piece is how many of these people are, how many,

1583
02:07:39,666 --> 02:07:44,612
[SPEAKER_50]: do they have that will be coming into our school district?

1584
02:07:44,652 --> 02:07:50,219
[SPEAKER_50]: Because they're newer apartments, they might, right, and that is something you would get from the census, and I understand that.

1585
02:07:50,579 --> 02:07:54,664
[SPEAKER_50]: And my only other concern is on the, I believe, third graph.

1586
02:07:55,616 --> 02:08:01,342
[SPEAKER_50]: And where it says school development enrollment percentage, I just want to keep an eye on things.

1587
02:08:01,583 --> 02:08:10,853
[SPEAKER_50]: And at the McGlynn, these new students, well, these new buildings affect 10%, almost 10%, 9.6% of their enrollment.

1588
02:08:11,173 --> 02:08:13,235
[SPEAKER_50]: So we want to see- Because of geography.

1589
02:08:13,475 --> 02:08:15,598
[SPEAKER_50]: Right, that's my whole point here.

1590
02:08:16,038 --> 02:08:17,520
[SPEAKER_50]: If we're adding more

1591
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:21,804
[SPEAKER_50]: apartments or condos in our community.

1592
02:08:22,044 --> 02:08:28,473
[SPEAKER_50]: We need to see where in the community is and which schools it's going to impact and how we want to deal with that ahead.

1593
02:08:28,493 --> 02:08:30,395
[SPEAKER_50]: We want to be proactive not reactive.

1594
02:08:30,856 --> 02:08:33,860
[SPEAKER_50]: So like we just want to be careful with that and

1595
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:48,149
[SPEAKER_50]: maybe we redistrict any new building in this side, from this side over goes to this school, and this side over goes to this school, for future districting, not redistricting existing people.

1596
02:08:48,269 --> 02:08:51,571
[SPEAKER_50]: Then you get less people mad at you already that live here.

1597
02:08:52,611 --> 02:08:52,951
[SPEAKER_50]: All right?

1598
02:08:53,232 --> 02:09:02,737
[SPEAKER_50]: So that's why I asked for this report, is I wanna be proactive, not reactive in how we place students, and to make sure that no one school is crowded.

1599
02:09:03,918 --> 02:09:04,999
[SPEAKER_50]: more crowded than others.

1600
02:09:06,060 --> 02:09:15,107
[SPEAKER_50]: So this is good information, so I make a motion at this point to re-look at these numbers again at the end of the school year, so in June.

1601
02:09:15,127 --> 02:09:17,429
[SPEAKER_50]: I have to do January.

1602
02:09:18,370 --> 02:09:19,491
[SPEAKER_50]: See if there's any changes.

1603
02:09:19,931 --> 02:09:21,593
[SPEAKER_55]: This cabinet will be coming online.

1604
02:09:21,833 --> 02:09:23,414
[SPEAKER_55]: Okay, so even, yeah.

1605
02:09:23,774 --> 02:09:24,195
[SPEAKER_55]: So moved.

1606
02:09:25,287 --> 02:09:29,570
[SPEAKER_55]: On the motion, this report be updated for the first meeting in January.

1607
02:09:30,571 --> 02:09:31,571
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

1608
02:09:31,791 --> 02:09:32,292
[SPEAKER_55]: Aye.

1609
02:09:32,432 --> 02:09:33,072
[SPEAKER_55]: All those opposed?

1610
02:09:33,132 --> 02:09:33,933
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

1611
02:09:34,613 --> 02:09:34,914
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1612
02:09:34,974 --> 02:09:36,675
[SPEAKER_55]: And that the report be placed on file.

1613
02:09:36,715 --> 02:09:37,455
[SPEAKER_55]: All those in favor?

1614
02:09:38,776 --> 02:09:39,196
[SPEAKER_55]: Opposed?

1615
02:09:39,216 --> 02:09:39,857
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

1616
02:09:40,797 --> 02:09:42,959
[SPEAKER_55]: Financial report close out of fiscal year 17.

1617
02:09:42,999 --> 02:09:43,039
[SPEAKER_55]: Ms.

1618
02:09:43,059 --> 02:09:43,339
[SPEAKER_55]: Patterson.

1619
02:09:50,790 --> 02:10:03,997
[SPEAKER_42]: So just as a preview as a first-year finance director It was important to become familiar with Medford's chart of accounts the budget categories structurally and payroll placements so this end of your report is a

1620
02:10:05,058 --> 02:10:23,471
[SPEAKER_42]: High-level look by department and category for end of year fiscal 17 as the report indicates the appropriation budget Offered by the city side is the fifty four million three hundred and thirty three thousand an additional 2.1

1621
02:10:25,312 --> 02:10:31,993
[SPEAKER_42]: was identified from outside revenue sources as the overall budget totaling $56,443,392 for fiscal year 2017.

1622
02:10:32,113 --> 02:10:35,934
[SPEAKER_42]: The year end finished with expenditures and remaining encumbrances totaling $55,686,555.

1623
02:10:35,994 --> 02:10:38,295
[SPEAKER_42]: So the difference in this close out was $1,458,616.

1624
02:10:38,395 --> 02:10:38,795
[SPEAKER_42]: This was a $651,000

1625
02:10:55,059 --> 02:11:02,483
[SPEAKER_42]: $776 less than projected to cover from additional revenue sources within the school departments.

1626
02:11:03,124 --> 02:11:11,129
[SPEAKER_42]: The remaining revenue offset has already been earmarked and planned for balancing for the FY18 budget revenue sources as well.

1627
02:11:12,005 --> 02:11:13,125
[SPEAKER_41]: So we didn't spend enough money?

1628
02:11:15,927 --> 02:11:17,827
[SPEAKER_42]: Nope, that's not what we're saying.

1629
02:11:18,788 --> 02:11:27,951
[SPEAKER_42]: We were looking at, you know, as we build the budget, it's a multi-year planning and analysis process.

1630
02:11:28,011 --> 02:11:34,434
[SPEAKER_42]: So it's done late in the fiscal year so that we can attempt to project

1631
02:11:35,074 --> 02:11:50,407
[SPEAKER_42]: where we are out in the current fiscal year and identify issues or concerns moving forward that we need to provide additional sources for, which we knew we were going to have some lower circuit breaker reimbursements in FY18.

1632
02:11:50,467 --> 02:11:53,030
[SPEAKER_42]: We were going to have reduced grant funding.

1633
02:11:53,610 --> 02:11:56,072
[SPEAKER_42]: And we have reduced homeless transportation reimbursement.

1634
02:11:56,092 --> 02:12:04,939
[SPEAKER_42]: So all of these indicators made it necessary and prudent for us to be as conservative as possible.

1635
02:12:05,059 --> 02:12:09,282
[SPEAKER_42]: So that 651,000 has been earmarked and planned for in the FY18 budget process.

1636
02:12:16,328 --> 02:12:32,947
[SPEAKER_42]: Moving forward again as high-level overviews and again, these are Programmatic programmatic savings in various line items so district-wide salaries we budget for

1637
02:12:34,428 --> 02:12:37,612
[SPEAKER_42]: a lump sum that is to be distributed and reallocated.

1638
02:12:37,712 --> 02:12:43,438
[SPEAKER_42]: So again, being new within the district, it looks like there's funds remaining there.

1639
02:12:43,518 --> 02:12:51,326
[SPEAKER_42]: However, they have already been dispersed among the appropriate accounts for step lane changes, things of that sort.

1640
02:12:52,528 --> 02:13:02,037
[SPEAKER_42]: The district wide substitute account, we did realize some savings related to more automatic and accurate substitute call out.

1641
02:13:02,537 --> 02:13:13,367
[SPEAKER_42]: The ASAP system was implemented and completed year one in fiscal year 2017, and it did realize some savings in that area.

1642
02:13:14,328 --> 02:13:19,331
[SPEAKER_42]: The ELL department salaries, these were paid within school program codes.

1643
02:13:19,451 --> 02:13:35,039
[SPEAKER_42]: So although they had been budgeted in one department, they were, again, the matching up in terms of salaries was for the end of year reporting purposes and did not necessarily align with the budget line placement.

1644
02:13:35,519 --> 02:13:41,783
[SPEAKER_42]: So again, just moving forward from my perspective, year one finance director,

1645
02:13:42,503 --> 02:13:49,186
[SPEAKER_42]: it was necessary for me to identify and see where these were before making significant changes.

1646
02:13:49,286 --> 02:13:52,608
[SPEAKER_42]: So we will be in that process moving forward for FY18.

1647
02:13:54,008 --> 02:14:03,332
[SPEAKER_42]: Additionally, the similar situation in the guidance, the directors were paid within the district-wide program versus the guidance department.

1648
02:14:03,793 --> 02:14:10,155
[SPEAKER_42]: And again, this is reporting distinctions for end of year report that did not align with the budget placement.

1649
02:14:11,757 --> 02:14:29,918
[SPEAKER_42]: The English language arts salaries again paid within the school program codes and again this is just for the understanding of the end-of-year report the Department of Ed requires us to report by school so there is a need to to track this and be able to see and

1650
02:14:30,338 --> 02:14:36,262
[SPEAKER_42]: the expenses for salaries in certain categories at a school-wide level.

1651
02:14:36,923 --> 02:14:46,129
[SPEAKER_42]: So that's something to keep in mind as we do budget a program, those expenses still will have to be reported out at the end of year.

1652
02:14:46,249 --> 02:14:54,335
[SPEAKER_42]: So there's still some alignment within our structure that just has to be translated to the end of year report.

1653
02:14:54,455 --> 02:14:57,397
[SPEAKER_42]: So where it seems to be variances,

1654
02:14:58,058 --> 02:15:03,456
[SPEAKER_42]: That's the rationale in terms of the actual placement of the expense.

1655
02:15:04,657 --> 02:15:08,558
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, similar situation within the library department salaries.

1656
02:15:08,638 --> 02:15:15,820
[SPEAKER_42]: The director had been paid through district-wide program area versus the library departmental area.

1657
02:15:16,661 --> 02:15:29,865
[SPEAKER_42]: The buildings and grounds, the utility usage for heating, which was natural gas, and our phone services did have some favorable contract rates, and we did have lower utilization.

1658
02:15:31,325 --> 02:15:50,995
[SPEAKER_42]: With the weather and things of that sort so that was favorable that was again Unpredictable year-to-year so the budget reflects a need and anticipated heating Year and due to certain situations in terms of

1659
02:15:52,076 --> 02:15:55,641
[SPEAKER_42]: Building temperatures, things of that sort, it can fluctuate.

1660
02:15:56,543 --> 02:16:04,094
[SPEAKER_42]: Hopefully we don't see a spike this year, but I don't know what the Farmer's Almanac will reveal.

1661
02:16:07,438 --> 02:16:16,342
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, each year during our budget process, our revenue sources are identified as the supplement to the appropriated budget.

1662
02:16:17,143 --> 02:16:19,724
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's a means to achieve the district goals.

1663
02:16:20,264 --> 02:16:27,388
[SPEAKER_42]: So the amounts that we had utilized and identified from each source was dependent on program needs and the available balances.

1664
02:16:28,028 --> 02:16:31,210
[SPEAKER_42]: So as we close out and continue to reconcile the year end,

1665
02:16:31,750 --> 02:16:37,673
[SPEAKER_42]: We will draw from the following accounts that we had identified during the FY17 budget development process.

1666
02:16:38,133 --> 02:16:47,697
[SPEAKER_42]: And again, with foresight going into the FY18 process, those similar program areas were earmarked for revenue offsets.

1667
02:16:48,337 --> 02:16:58,246
[SPEAKER_42]: And those areas include the before and after school programs, the MEEP, the SURE and special ed tuitions that come in, the circuit breaker.

1668
02:16:58,506 --> 02:17:02,329
[SPEAKER_42]: Again, we've been notified that that reimbursement level has decreased.

1669
02:17:02,749 --> 02:17:03,530
[SPEAKER_42]: We're down to about 65%.

1670
02:17:05,191 --> 02:17:11,257
[SPEAKER_42]: And that is a cost that cannot be managed or tracked year to year.

1671
02:17:11,897 --> 02:17:13,779
[SPEAKER_42]: dependent on student need.

1672
02:17:14,119 --> 02:17:30,492
[SPEAKER_42]: So transportation reimbursement, again that continues to drop and as we have fewer students placed out of our district, those funds begin to dwindle.

1673
02:17:31,173 --> 02:17:45,373
[SPEAKER_42]: We did have vocational tuitions, and we had E-rate reimbursement, as well as our building facility rentals, which included all of the community schools, our rink, our pool, the fields, which we have reviewed extensively.

1674
02:17:46,034 --> 02:17:52,898
[SPEAKER_42]: And again, continuous communication, working with the city hall, our auditor side, and treasury.

1675
02:17:53,318 --> 02:18:00,641
[SPEAKER_42]: We will be determining final amounts from each of the sources and plan the application of those moving forward to FY18.

1676
02:18:01,202 --> 02:18:11,047
[SPEAKER_42]: So as we go forward, moving along in this fiscal year, reports will be provided as we continue to do the finalization of closeouts.

1677
02:18:12,087 --> 02:18:13,668
[SPEAKER_55]: Very good, thank you so much, Christine.

1678
02:18:14,108 --> 02:18:14,488
[SPEAKER_55]: Mayor Berk.

1679
02:18:14,508 --> 02:18:14,588
[SPEAKER_55]: Ms.

1680
02:18:14,608 --> 02:18:14,769
[SPEAKER_55]: Stone.

1681
02:18:16,071 --> 02:18:24,894
[SPEAKER_57]: Christine, just on the first page, the third paragraph, the last one, the undistributed unemployment, is that one employee or is that a number of employees?

1682
02:18:24,914 --> 02:18:27,115
[SPEAKER_42]: No, multiple employees throughout the year.

1683
02:18:27,135 --> 02:18:27,875
[SPEAKER_57]: Okay.

1684
02:18:28,735 --> 02:18:32,717
[SPEAKER_57]: And is that, so it's 72,000, is that accurate?

1685
02:18:32,777 --> 02:18:34,837
[SPEAKER_57]: Is that a typical year for unemployment?

1686
02:18:35,497 --> 02:18:38,358
[SPEAKER_42]: That seems to be the average looking back, yes.

1687
02:18:39,119 --> 02:18:39,819
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, wow.

1688
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:42,200
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's just the school department size.

1689
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:42,660
[SPEAKER_42]: Right, right.

1690
02:18:44,286 --> 02:18:44,406
[SPEAKER_41]: Ms.

1691
02:18:44,446 --> 02:18:45,147
[SPEAKER_41]: Van der Kloot.

1692
02:18:45,187 --> 02:18:50,291
[SPEAKER_41]: Christine, I just want to thank you for your diligence in sorting out all of these accounts, and this is good news.

1693
02:18:50,311 --> 02:18:50,871
[SPEAKER_41]: Great.

1694
02:18:51,231 --> 02:18:51,551
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1695
02:18:51,852 --> 02:18:53,033
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you very much, Christine.

1696
02:18:53,213 --> 02:18:53,633
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1697
02:18:53,653 --> 02:18:58,136
[SPEAKER_55]: So at this point, if we could just entertain a quick little diversion.

1698
02:18:58,156 --> 02:19:06,743
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't know how many of you realize, but over the course of the last week, we've been collecting sporting goods equipment to send down to the Houston area.

1699
02:19:07,704 --> 02:19:15,551
[SPEAKER_55]: We realized how they were devastated and a lot of people were giving blood, donating money, and doing all sorts of things to help them out.

1700
02:19:16,252 --> 02:19:20,856
[SPEAKER_55]: Our head baseball coach, Mike Nestor, came up with an idea and he said, why don't we do a drive?

1701
02:19:20,876 --> 02:19:22,257
[SPEAKER_55]: These kids want to get back.

1702
02:19:23,298 --> 02:19:24,319
[SPEAKER_55]: They have no equipment.

1703
02:19:24,399 --> 02:19:25,561
[SPEAKER_55]: Everything's been just ruined.

1704
02:19:26,401 --> 02:19:28,223
[SPEAKER_55]: So he wanted to start a drive for it.

1705
02:19:29,344 --> 02:19:35,389
[SPEAKER_55]: Jack Dempsey has put together this awesome video that is on a truck right now rolling into Texas.

1706
02:19:36,189 --> 02:19:39,812
[SPEAKER_55]: And it's just really spectacular how the community came together.

1707
02:19:39,832 --> 02:19:50,721
[SPEAKER_55]: A lot of the sporting teams and the sporting equipment stores that supply our players with their equipment came through and put so many things on this truck.

1708
02:19:51,121 --> 02:19:52,262
[SPEAKER_55]: It's just simply amazing.

1709
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:58,627
[SPEAKER_55]: So without further ado, I hope you all enjoy this video that Jack and the team put together with all the kids at the high school.

1710
02:20:08,610 --> 02:20:11,354
[SPEAKER_71]: Harvey, you have a problem.

1711
02:20:11,494 --> 02:20:12,075
[SPEAKER_71]: The Mustangs!

1712
02:20:32,443 --> 02:20:34,305
[SPEAKER_64]: Mustangs win together!

1713
02:20:34,725 --> 02:20:37,227
[SPEAKER_64]: One, two, three, Mustangs!

1714
02:20:37,267 --> 02:20:39,289
[SPEAKER_55]: Hello, my name is Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

1715
02:20:39,349 --> 02:20:42,991
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm the mayor of Medford, Mass., home of the mighty Medford Mustangs.

1716
02:20:43,412 --> 02:20:48,135
[SPEAKER_55]: They say up here in Medford country that our veins bleed blue and white, and we know you're the same.

1717
02:20:48,616 --> 02:20:51,278
[SPEAKER_55]: We're here to support you in rebuilding your community.

1718
02:20:51,498 --> 02:20:55,881
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm here with our athletic director, Bobby Maloney, and our head baseball coach, Mike Nestor.

1719
02:20:56,242 --> 02:20:57,703
[SPEAKER_55]: Bobby, would you like to say a few words?

1720
02:20:58,108 --> 02:21:01,889
[SPEAKER_89]: Yeah, Barry Campbell, from one Mustang to another, we're coming with some help.

1721
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:09,132
[SPEAKER_89]: The citizens and the school department are going to step up, and you're going to get a nice truckload from Local 25 headed your way.

1722
02:21:09,772 --> 02:21:10,152
[SPEAKER_89]: Good luck.

1723
02:21:10,392 --> 02:21:13,413
[SPEAKER_89]: Keep us in touch, and thoughts and prayers are with the entire community.

1724
02:21:15,254 --> 02:21:15,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael.

1725
02:21:15,894 --> 02:21:17,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Coach Kelly Meade, baseball coach.

1726
02:21:18,195 --> 02:21:19,535
[SPEAKER_22]: From one to another, we're here.

1727
02:21:19,575 --> 02:21:20,395
[SPEAKER_22]: We've got your back.

1728
02:21:20,695 --> 02:21:22,896
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to show you what Mustang Strong is all about.

1729
02:21:24,076 --> 02:21:25,497
[SPEAKER_01]: Mustang Strong!

1730
02:21:35,056 --> 02:21:40,337
[SPEAKER_27]: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.

[SPEAKER_15]: All right, from Mustang to Mustangs.

1739
02:21:56,261 --> 02:22:03,602
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Coach Joe Donlon of the Medford High School, Mustangs, letting you guys know that we are one track family, and we're here for you.

02:22:22,196 --> 02:22:23,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Go Mustangs!

1745
02:22:24,097 --> 02:22:24,538
[SPEAKER_33]: Hello.

1746
02:22:25,579 --> 02:22:29,481
[SPEAKER_33]: The Mustang way is that we take care of our own and we support each other at all times.

1747
02:22:30,422 --> 02:22:32,704
[SPEAKER_33]: We're with you every gallop of the way.

1748
02:22:34,986 --> 02:22:39,529
[SPEAKER_37]: From our Mustangs to yours, keep on galloping!

1749
02:22:40,553 --> 02:22:41,854
[SPEAKER_75]: Go Mustangs!

1750
02:22:42,154 --> 02:22:44,395
[SPEAKER_36]: We support the Kingman Mustangs.

1751
02:22:44,495 --> 02:22:45,575
[SPEAKER_36]: Woo!

1752
02:22:45,836 --> 02:22:47,456
[SPEAKER_36]: Go Mustangs!

1753
02:22:48,037 --> 02:22:52,839
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to first pass along my best wishes for your recovery efforts down there in Houston.

1754

[SPEAKER_68]: Go Mustangs!

[SPEAKER_25]: Bedford Mustangs are here to support the Kingswood Mustangs.

1763
02:23:27,331 --> 02:23:30,414
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's Mustang stick together, hang in there through the good and bad.

1764
02:23:30,514 --> 02:23:31,515
[SPEAKER_25]: We're with you.

1765
02:23:31,555 --> 02:23:33,916
[SPEAKER_25]: We're here to fight!

1766
02:23:33,936 --> 02:23:34,917
[SPEAKER_66]: We're here to fight!

1767

1768
02:23:37,479 --> 02:23:38,400
[SPEAKER_76]: Go Mustangs!

1769
02:23:38,540 --> 02:23:40,261
[SPEAKER_59]: Go Mustangs, we got your back.

1770
02:23:40,902 --> 02:23:42,103
[SPEAKER_76]: Go Mustangs!

1771
02:23:43,247 --> 02:23:44,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustangs support Mustangs.

1772
02:23:44,527 --> 02:23:45,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang in there.

1773
02:23:45,367 --> 02:23:46,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi Kingwood High School.

1774
02:23:46,728 --> 02:23:47,888
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Jason Nascimento.

1775
02:23:47,948 --> 02:23:50,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the head football coach here at Medford High School.

1776
02:23:51,289 --> 02:23:56,470
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the Medford Mustangs here want to wish all of our well-wishers to support you guys.

1777
02:24:01,711 --> 02:24:02,731
[SPEAKER_87]: Go Mustangs!

1778
02:24:03,031 --> 02:24:04,151
[SPEAKER_87]: We, Mustangs, are with you.

1779
02:24:04,991 --> 02:24:07,492
[SPEAKER_87]: From us to you, we support you.

1780
02:24:11,121 --> 02:24:13,562
[SPEAKER_13]: From our Mustangs to yours, keep pushing forward.

1781
02:24:13,602 --> 02:24:14,262
[SPEAKER_13]: It gets better.

1782
02:24:14,402 --> 02:24:15,002
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got this.

1783
02:24:15,542 --> 02:24:17,162
[SPEAKER_72]: Go Mustangs!

1784
02:24:17,182 --> 02:24:17,903

[SPEAKER_06]: From the Medford Mustang softball team to the Kingwood Mustang softball team.

1787
02:25:14,301 --> 02:25:15,823
[SPEAKER_83]: You're not the only one.

1788
02:25:47,427 --> 02:25:49,050
[SPEAKER_83]: and leave yesterday behind

1789
02:26:16,623 --> 02:26:22,427
[SPEAKER_55]: So we want to thank the Teamsters 25 for trucking down all of the items that we collected over the course of the last week.

1790
02:26:22,447 --> 02:26:27,110
[SPEAKER_55]: I know that they probably will still take more down if we are able to give them some more stuff.

1791
02:26:27,790 --> 02:26:29,792
[SPEAKER_55]: And just all the athletes that participated.

1792
02:26:29,832 --> 02:26:31,192
[SPEAKER_55]: They all were there.

1793
02:26:31,973 --> 02:26:32,934
[SPEAKER_55]: All the teams came.

1794
02:26:33,414 --> 02:26:34,315
[SPEAKER_55]: All the teams helped.

1795
02:26:34,815 --> 02:26:38,317
[SPEAKER_55]: And we're doing such a nice thing for the kids in the Houston area.

1796
02:26:38,397 --> 02:26:40,398
[SPEAKER_55]: So thanks to everybody who donated.

1797
02:26:40,539 --> 02:26:41,939
[SPEAKER_55]: And keep up the good work.

1798
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:42,400
[SPEAKER_55]: Thank you.

1799
02:26:47,207 --> 02:26:50,229
[SPEAKER_55]: All righty, we will now be entering executive session.

1800
02:26:50,289 --> 02:26:52,009
[SPEAKER_55]: Is there a vote, Madam Secretary?

[SPEAKER_55]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

02:28:27,908 --> 02:28:28,689
[SPEAKER_55]: Motion passes.

1834
02:28:28,709 --> 02:28:30,590
[SPEAKER_55]: We will now be entering executive session.

1835
02:45:01,322 --> 02:45:02,082
[SPEAKER_26]: They'll test you.

1836
02:45:03,863 --> 02:45:05,043
[SPEAKER_26]: Try to break your will.

1837
02:45:07,424 --> 02:45:15,987
[SPEAKER_26]: But however loud the loudness gets, however many cheese puffs may fly, you're the driver, the one in control.

1838
02:45:16,548 --> 02:45:17,508
[SPEAKER_26]: Stand firm.

1839
02:45:18,368 --> 02:45:18,928
[SPEAKER_26]: Just wait.

1840
02:45:21,709 --> 02:45:25,571
[SPEAKER_26]: And move only when you hear the click that says they're buckled in for the drive.

1841
02:45:26,551 --> 02:45:28,392
[SPEAKER_26]: Never give up till they buckle up.

1842
02:45:30,685 --> 02:45:32,446
[SPEAKER_53]: Marie, you have pre-diabetes.

1843
02:45:32,686 --> 02:45:33,707
[SPEAKER_56]: Pre-diabetes?

1844
02:45:33,947 --> 02:45:36,209
[SPEAKER_56]: I don't have time to eat right or exercise.

1845
02:45:36,229 --> 02:45:37,270
[SPEAKER_56]: I'm a busy mom.

1846
02:45:38,290 --> 02:45:39,371
[SPEAKER_53]: Oh, you're a busy mom.

1847
02:45:39,731 --> 02:45:40,032
[SPEAKER_56]: Yeah.

1848
02:45:40,372 --> 02:45:41,613
[SPEAKER_53]: This is great news.

1849
02:45:41,733 --> 02:45:43,474
[SPEAKER_53]: Busy moms never get pre-diabetes.

1850
02:45:43,714 --> 02:45:44,175
[SPEAKER_53]: Wait, what?

1851
02:45:44,195 --> 02:45:51,340
[SPEAKER_53]: Let me just... Yeah, this is all the people at risk for pre-diabetes, and way over here, busy moms.

1852
02:46:17,554 --> 02:46:18,099
You're right.

1853
02:46:40,388 --> 02:46:45,312
[SPEAKER_24]: Eva Marie smoked 12,000 packs of cigarettes over 15 years.

1854
02:46:46,193 --> 02:46:46,794
[SPEAKER_24]: She quit.

1855
02:46:47,314 --> 02:46:50,397
[SPEAKER_24]: And now there's a new lung cancer screening that could save her life.

1856
02:46:51,338 --> 02:46:52,419
[SPEAKER_24]: You stopped smoking.

1857
02:46:52,979 --> 02:46:54,060
[SPEAKER_24]: Now start screening.

1858
02:46:54,701 --> 02:46:58,564
[SPEAKER_24]: No matter how much you've smoked, early detection could save you.

1859
02:46:58,964 --> 02:47:02,428
[SPEAKER_24]: Talk to your doctor or learn more at SavedByTheScan.org.

1860
02:47:57,340 --> 02:48:01,221
[SPEAKER_35]: One in six seniors faces the threat of hunger, and millions more live in isolation.

1861
02:48:01,761 --> 02:48:03,942
[SPEAKER_84]: America, let's do lunch.

1862
02:48:04,442 --> 02:48:06,663
[SPEAKER_35]: Drop off a hot meal and say a quick hello.

1863
02:48:07,123 --> 02:48:11,725
[SPEAKER_35]: Volunteer for Meals on Wheels by donating your lunch break at americaletsdolunch.org.

1864
02:48:13,605 --> 02:48:22,228
[SPEAKER_86]: Listen, I realize that I'm not perfect, but it all really started to change because you judge me for having a problem.

1865
02:48:23,723 --> 02:48:27,385
[SPEAKER_86]: No one is going to know that I need help.

1866
02:48:28,965 --> 02:48:29,586
[SPEAKER_86]: I need help.

1867
02:48:30,106 --> 02:48:33,167
[SPEAKER_86]: I know that no one is going to judge me for having a problem.

1868
02:48:33,747 --> 02:48:39,470
[SPEAKER_86]: I realize that I'm not perfect, but it all really started to change because you listened.

1869
02:48:56,586 --> 02:48:57,227
[SPEAKER_17]: So there you are.

1870
02:48:59,169 --> 02:49:01,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Shuffling through a stack of resumes and you come to mine.

1871
02:49:03,493 --> 02:49:03,934
[SPEAKER_17]: This is it.

1872
02:49:04,915 --> 02:49:05,575
[SPEAKER_17]: First impression.

1873
02:49:06,717 --> 02:49:07,217
[SPEAKER_17]: My way in.

1874
02:49:08,479 --> 02:49:10,100
[SPEAKER_17]: But here's the thing.

1875
02:49:11,442 --> 02:49:13,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Can my resume show you how I truly stand out?

1876
02:49:16,787 --> 02:49:19,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Can one piece of paper really tell you my whole story?

1877
02:49:22,115 --> 02:49:28,137
[SPEAKER_17]: Like that I was studying, going to night school while working two jobs just to help my parents pay for groceries.

1878
02:49:29,037 --> 02:49:32,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Or how any time there was an opportunity, I was the first one to step up.

1879
02:49:33,459 --> 02:49:38,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I wasn't gonna let my life, my circumstances dictate who I was gonna become.

1880
02:49:39,080 --> 02:49:44,502
[SPEAKER_17]: And all of that, that determination, the commitment, the drive, that's me.

1881
02:49:45,442 --> 02:49:47,283
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's something you just can't put on paper.

1882
02:49:48,197 --> 02:49:52,162
[SPEAKER_17]: look beyond the resume, discover new ways to develop great talent like me.

1883
02:49:56,548 --> 02:50:01,134
[SPEAKER_85]: I'm a retired school psychologist and helping people was my

1884
02:50:03,749 --> 02:50:07,871
[SPEAKER_31]: I was very independent, thought I could take care of myself.

1885
02:50:08,771 --> 02:50:11,612
[SPEAKER_31]: I fell, and I had to have Meals on Wheels.

1886
02:50:12,252 --> 02:50:17,814
[SPEAKER_85]: After my stroke, when Meals on Wheels started, I was on the other end of the stick, so to speak.

1887
02:50:18,014 --> 02:50:27,437
[SPEAKER_45]: Meals on Wheels coming to my door as someone who's housebound, having someone check on me, assures me that I'm not forgotten.

1888
02:50:28,017 --> 02:50:32,659
[SPEAKER_67]: Meals on Wheels has given me a mode of freedom that I wouldn't have otherwise.

1889
02:50:33,830 --> 02:50:34,671
[SPEAKER_31]: We are the clients.

1890
02:50:34,711 --> 02:50:35,532
[SPEAKER_31]: We are the clients.

1891
02:50:35,592 --> 02:50:38,254
[SPEAKER_31]: We are the clients of Meals on Wheels.

1892
02:50:39,535 --> 02:50:42,698
[SPEAKER_31]: America, let's do lunch.

1893
02:50:43,239 --> 02:50:47,143
[SPEAKER_35]: One in six seniors faces the threat of hunger, and millions more live in isolation.

1894
02:50:48,284 --> 02:50:50,406
[SPEAKER_35]: Drop off a hot meal and say a quick hello.

1895
02:50:51,126 --> 02:50:54,470
[SPEAKER_35]: Volunteer by donating your lunch break at americaletsdolunch.org.

1896
02:52:08,369 --> 02:52:11,010
[SPEAKER_47]: Hmm, maybe you can make retirement happen.

1897
02:52:11,690 --> 02:52:13,891
[SPEAKER_47]: After all, you made her college years happen.

1898
02:52:15,332 --> 02:52:17,792
[SPEAKER_47]: Opening that education savings account when she was little.

1899
02:52:18,573 --> 02:52:19,873
[SPEAKER_47]: Spearheading a campus tour.

1900
02:52:20,593 --> 02:52:22,774
[SPEAKER_47]: And another, and another, and another, and another.

1901
02:52:23,074 --> 02:52:23,494
[SPEAKER_47]: Bam!

1902
02:52:24,475 --> 02:52:25,995
[SPEAKER_47]: Deciphering financial aid.

1903
02:52:26,635 --> 02:52:28,716
[SPEAKER_47]: She was like, what?

1904
02:52:29,176 --> 02:52:33,198
[SPEAKER_47]: And now she's like, you waste planning for college.

1905
02:52:33,598 --> 02:52:36,879
[SPEAKER_47]: Now get the tips you need to get on track at aceyourretirement.org.

1906
02:52:39,272 --> 02:52:41,833
[SPEAKER_39]: Every year, 40% of all food in the U.S.

1907
02:52:41,973 --> 02:52:44,194
[SPEAKER_39]: never gets eaten.

1908
02:52:44,214 --> 02:52:44,194
40%.

1909
02:52:44,434 --> 02:52:46,435
[SPEAKER_39]: That's almost half the food we produce.

1910
02:52:46,856 --> 02:52:48,817
[SPEAKER_39]: Food waste is a serious problem.

1911
02:52:48,837 --> 02:52:50,137
[SPEAKER_39]: It impacts all of us.

1912
02:52:50,617 --> 02:52:51,798
[SPEAKER_39]: And it's expensive.

1913
02:52:51,978 --> 02:52:55,199
[SPEAKER_39]: Your family is throwing $1,500 a year in the trash.

1914
02:52:55,460 --> 02:52:58,501
[SPEAKER_39]: We're working hard to put food waste on the chopping block.

1915
02:52:58,921 --> 02:53:00,562
[SPEAKER_39]: And you can do the same at home.

1916
02:53:00,822 --> 02:53:03,083
[SPEAKER_39]: Learn how to cook it, store it, and share it.

1917
02:53:03,263 --> 02:53:04,444
[SPEAKER_39]: Just don't waste it.

1918
02:53:05,004 --> 02:53:06,545
[SPEAKER_39]: Go to SaveTheFood.com.

1919
02:53:10,036 --> 02:53:12,758
[SPEAKER_53]: Well, Thomas, you've got prediabetes.

1920
02:53:13,599 --> 02:53:16,301
[SPEAKER_53]: But with more exercise and a change in diet, it can be reversed.

1921
02:53:17,061 --> 02:53:17,902
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried exercising.

1922
02:53:17,942 --> 02:53:19,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes me hungry.

1923
02:53:19,703 --> 02:53:20,464
[SPEAKER_52]: For bacon.

1924
02:53:21,885 --> 02:53:22,706
[SPEAKER_52]: I love bacon, too.

1925
02:53:23,046 --> 02:53:24,667
[SPEAKER_52]: And who really likes to exercise?

1926
02:53:24,747 --> 02:53:25,248

2083
03:03:49,408 --> 03:03:50,589
[SPEAKER_26]: Try to break your will.

2084
03:03:52,969 --> 03:04:01,531
[SPEAKER_26]: But however loud the loudness gets, however many cheese puffs may fly, you're the driver, the one in control.

2085
03:04:02,071 --> 03:04:03,051
[SPEAKER_26]: Stand firm.

2086
03:04:03,911 --> 03:04:04,471
[SPEAKER_26]: Just wait.

2087
03:04:07,252 --> 03:04:11,112
[SPEAKER_26]: And move only when you hear the click that says they're buckled in for the drive.

2088
03:04:12,093 --> 03:04:13,933
[SPEAKER_26]: Never give up till they buckle up.

2089
03:04:17,067 --> 03:04:19,548
[SPEAKER_44]: Why is Connor having trouble focusing in school?

2090
03:04:20,148 --> 03:04:22,309
[SPEAKER_44]: Having trouble finding Connor's middle school?

2091
03:04:22,410 --> 03:04:23,510
[SPEAKER_44]: Would you like directions?

2092
03:04:23,850 --> 03:04:27,132
[SPEAKER_49]: No, why is Connor having trouble focusing in school?

2093
03:04:27,672 --> 03:04:29,733
[SPEAKER_49]: Finding lowest airfare to Istanbul.

2094
03:04:30,752 --> 03:04:33,653

03:04:36,394 --> 03:04:37,594
[SPEAKER_49]: No, I need help.

2098
03:04:37,914 --> 03:04:40,895
[SPEAKER_49]: He's very smart, but his mind wanders.

2099
03:04:40,915 --> 03:04:41,855
[SPEAKER_49]: He's disorganized.

2100
03:04:42,476 --> 03:04:43,536
[SPEAKER_49]: I think I understand.

2101
03:04:43,556 --> 03:04:44,536
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, God.

2102
03:04:44,756 --> 03:04:45,436
[SPEAKER_44]: French fries.

2103
03:04:45,677 --> 03:04:46,917
[SPEAKER_44]: Finding best potatoes.

2104
03:04:47,117 --> 03:04:47,477
[SPEAKER_44]: No!

2105
03:04:47,937 --> 03:04:48,337
[SPEAKER_44]: Russet.

2106
03:04:48,637 --> 03:04:49,158
[SPEAKER_44]: Fingerling.

2107
03:04:49,518 --> 03:04:50,238
[SPEAKER_44]: Yukongo.

2108
03:04:50,598 --> 03:04:52,279
[SPEAKER_44]: Why don't you understand me?

2109
03:04:53,059 --> 03:04:56,540
[SPEAKER_44]: Sorry, I was trying to show how Connor feels every day.

2110
03:04:56,820 --> 03:04:57,900
[SPEAKER_44]: Frustrating, isn't it?

2111
03:04:58,180 --> 03:04:59,941
[SPEAKER_44]: Redirecting to understood.org.

2112
03:05:01,037 --> 03:05:05,098

03:05:17,601 --> 03:05:19,341
[SPEAKER_53]: MARIE, YOU HAVE PRE-DIABETES.

2119
03:05:19,601 --> 03:05:20,601
[SPEAKER_56]: PRE-DIABETES?

2120
03:05:20,861 --> 03:05:23,122
[SPEAKER_56]: I DON'T HAVE TIME TO EAT, WRITE OR EXERCISE.

2121
03:05:23,402 --> 03:05:24,082
[SPEAKER_56]: I'M A BUSY MOM.

2122
03:05:25,191 --> 03:05:26,272
[SPEAKER_53]: Oh, you're a busy mom.

2123
03:05:26,613 --> 03:05:26,913
[SPEAKER_56]: Yeah.

2124
03:05:27,274 --> 03:05:28,515
[SPEAKER_53]: This is great news.

2125
03:05:28,615 --> 03:05:30,377
[SPEAKER_53]: Busy moms never get pre-diabetes.

2126
03:05:30,618 --> 03:05:31,098
[SPEAKER_53]: Wait, what?

2127
03:05:31,419 --> 03:05:38,247
[SPEAKER_53]: Let me just... Yeah, this is all the people at risk for pre-diabetes, and way over here, busy moms.

2128
03:06:21,957 --> 03:06:25,863
[SPEAKER_35]: One in six seniors faces the threat of hunger, and millions more live in isolation.

2129
03:06:26,403 --> 03:06:28,566
[SPEAKER_84]: America, let's do lunch.

2130
03:06:29,067 --> 03:06:31,290
[SPEAKER_35]: Drop off a hot meal and say a quick hello.

2131
03:06:31,750 --> 03:06:36,016
[SPEAKER_35]: Volunteer for Meals on Wheels by donating your lunch break at americaletsdolunch.org.

2132
03:07:10,693 --> 03:07:12,534
[SPEAKER_47]: Maybe you can make retirement happen.

2133
03:07:13,234 --> 03:07:15,415
[SPEAKER_47]: After all, you made her college years happen.

2134
03:07:16,856 --> 03:07:19,317
[SPEAKER_47]: Opening that education savings account when she was little.

2135
03:07:20,097 --> 03:07:21,398
[SPEAKER_47]: Spearheading a campus tour.

2136
03:07:22,118 --> 03:07:24,299
[SPEAKER_47]: And another, and another, and another, and another.

2137
03:07:24,599 --> 03:07:25,039
[SPEAKER_47]: Bam!

2138
03:07:26,019 --> 03:07:27,520
[SPEAKER_47]: Deciphering financial aid.

2139
03:07:28,160 --> 03:07:30,241
[SPEAKER_47]: She was like, what?

2140
03:07:30,701 --> 03:07:34,723
[SPEAKER_47]: And now she's like, you waste planning for college.

2141
03:07:35,123 --> 03:07:38,405
[SPEAKER_47]: Now get the tips you need to get on track at aceyourretirement.org.

2142
03:07:51,896 --> 03:07:55,709
[SPEAKER_85]: I'm a retired school psychologist and helping people was my...

2143
03:07:58,065 --> 03:08:02,187
[SPEAKER_31]: I was very independent, thought I could take care of myself.

2144
03:08:03,087 --> 03:08:05,928
[SPEAKER_31]: I fell, and I had to have Meals on Wheels.

2145
03:08:06,568 --> 03:08:12,110
[SPEAKER_85]: After my stroke, when Meals on Wheels started, I was on other end of the sticks, so to speak.

2146
03:08:12,330 --> 03:08:21,753
[SPEAKER_45]: Meals on Wheels, coming to my door as someone who's housebound, having someone check on me, assures me that I'm not forgotten.

2147
03:08:22,313 --> 03:08:26,955
[SPEAKER_67]: Meals on Wheels has given me a mode of freedom that I wouldn't have otherwise.

2148
03:08:28,123 --> 03:08:28,983
[SPEAKER_31]: We're the clients.

2149
03:08:29,023 --> 03:08:29,824
[SPEAKER_31]: We are the clients.

2150
03:08:29,884 --> 03:08:32,564
[SPEAKER_31]: We are the clients of Meals on Wheels.

2151
03:08:34,305 --> 03:08:37,006
[SPEAKER_31]: America, let's do lunch.

2152
03:08:37,546 --> 03:08:41,427
[SPEAKER_35]: One in six seniors faces the threat of hunger, and millions more live in isolation.

2153
03:08:42,588 --> 03:08:44,729
[SPEAKER_35]: Drop off a hot meal and say a quick hello.

2154
03:08:45,429 --> 03:08:48,990
[SPEAKER_35]: Volunteer by donating your lunch break at americaletsdolunch.org.

2155
03:08:55,933 --> 03:09:00,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Grab some friends and family and get outside this summer to explore your watershed.

2156
03:09:00,716 --> 03:09:02,777
[SPEAKER_11]: The Mystic Quest has activities for everyone.

2157
03:09:03,197 --> 03:09:11,161
[SPEAKER_11]: They range from viewing art, getting active, helping to keep our rivers clean, looking for wildlife and discovering history and local landmarks.

2158
03:09:11,741 --> 03:09:16,164
[SPEAKER_11]: There are 22 communities in the Mystic River Watershed and lots of ways to enjoy them.

2159
03:09:16,844 --> 03:09:19,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Teams are encouraged and prizes will be awarded.

2160
03:09:19,986 --> 03:09:24,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't forget to share your explorations by using the hashtag MysticQuest.

2161
03:09:39,640 --> 03:09:42,361
[SPEAKER_53]: Well, Thomas, you've got prediabetes.

2162
03:09:43,182 --> 03:09:45,903
[SPEAKER_53]: But with more exercise and a change in diet, it can be reversed.

2163
03:09:46,643 --> 03:09:47,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried exercising.

2164
03:09:47,544 --> 03:09:48,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes me hungry.

2165
03:09:49,325 --> 03:09:50,065
[SPEAKER_03]: For bacon.

2166
03:09:51,486 --> 03:09:52,306
[SPEAKER_52]: I love bacon, too.

2167
03:09:52,646 --> 03:09:54,247
[SPEAKER_52]: And who really likes to exercise?

2168
03:09:54,327 --> 03:09:54,868
[SPEAKER_52]: Not me.

2169
03:09:54,928 --> 03:09:55,428
[SPEAKER_60]: Me neither.

2170
03:09:55,488 --> 03:09:56,068
[SPEAKER_60]: Nobody!

2171
03:10:00,390 --> 03:10:01,191
[SPEAKER_52]: So, we're good?

2172
03:10:01,411 --> 03:10:01,571
[SPEAKER_52]: What?

2173
03:10:02,631 --> 03:10:03,872
[SPEAKER_51]: Oh, you still have prediabetes.

2174
03:10:06,913 --> 03:10:07,574
[SPEAKER_51]: Big time.

2175
03:10:22,950 --> 03:10:23,590
[SPEAKER_16]: So there you are.

2176
03:10:25,531 --> 03:10:27,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Shuffling through a stack of resumes and you come to mine.

2177
03:10:29,873 --> 03:10:30,313
[SPEAKER_17]: This is it.

2178
03:10:31,274 --> 03:10:31,934
[SPEAKER_17]: First impression.

2179
03:10:33,074 --> 03:10:33,575
[SPEAKER_17]: My way in.

2180
03:10:34,835 --> 03:10:36,456
[SPEAKER_17]: But here's the thing.

2181
03:10:37,817 --> 03:10:40,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Can my resume show you how I truly stand out?

2182
03:10:43,159 --> 03:10:45,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Can one piece of paper really tell you my whole story?

2183
03:10:48,499 --> 03:10:54,521
[SPEAKER_17]: Like that I was studying, going to night school while working two jobs just to help my parents pay for groceries.

2184
03:10:55,401 --> 03:10:59,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Or how any time there was an opportunity, I was the first one to step up.

2185
03:10:59,823 --> 03:11:04,865
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I wasn't going to let my life, my circumstances dictate who I was going to become.

2186
03:11:05,465 --> 03:11:10,867
[SPEAKER_17]: And all of that, that determination, the commitment, the drive, that's me.

2187
03:11:11,807 --> 03:11:13,668
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's something you just can't put on paper.

2188
03:11:14,558 --> 03:11:15,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Look beyond the resume.

2189
03:11:16,085 --> 03:11:18,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Discover new ways to develop great talent, like me.

2190
03:12:03,933 --> 03:12:12,639
[SPEAKER_86]: Listen, I realize that I'm not perfect, but it all really started to change because you judge me for having a problem.

2191
03:12:14,060 --> 03:12:17,443
[SPEAKER_86]: No one is going to know that I need help.

2192
03:12:19,284 --> 03:12:19,945
[SPEAKER_86]: I need help.

2193
03:12:20,425 --> 03:12:23,527
[SPEAKER_86]: I know that no one is going to judge me for having a problem.

2194
03:12:24,088 --> 03:12:29,752
[SPEAKER_86]: I realize that I'm not perfect, but it all really started to change because you listen.

2195
03:13:35,700 --> 03:13:38,261
[SPEAKER_39]: Every year, 40% of all food in the U.S.

2196
03:13:38,401 --> 03:13:40,621
[SPEAKER_39]: never gets eaten.

2197
03:13:40,641 --> 03:13:40,621
40%.

2198
03:13:40,862 --> 03:13:42,862
[SPEAKER_39]: That's almost half the food we produce.

2199
03:13:43,302 --> 03:13:45,243
[SPEAKER_39]: Food waste is a serious problem.

2200
03:13:45,263 --> 03:13:46,583
[SPEAKER_39]: It impacts all of us.

2201
03:13:47,043 --> 03:13:48,224
[SPEAKER_39]: And it's expensive.

2202
03:13:48,404 --> 03:13:51,645
[SPEAKER_39]: Your family is throwing $1,500 a year in the trash.

2203
03:13:51,885 --> 03:13:54,926
[SPEAKER_39]: We're working hard to put food waste on the chopping block.

2204
03:13:55,346 --> 03:13:57,006
[SPEAKER_39]: And you can do the same at home.

2205
03:13:57,266 --> 03:13:59,467
[SPEAKER_39]: Learn how to cook it, store it, and share it.

2206
03:13:59,687 --> 03:14:00,867
[SPEAKER_39]: Just don't waste it.

2207
03:14:01,427 --> 03:14:02,968
[SPEAKER_39]: Go to SaveTheFood.com.

2208
03:14:17,829 --> 03:14:20,052
[SPEAKER_71]: Harvey, you have a problem.

2209
03:14:20,072 --> 03:14:20,652
[SPEAKER_71]: The Mustangs!

2210
03:14:41,760 --> 03:14:42,761
[SPEAKER_64]: Mustangs win!

2211
03:14:42,821 --> 03:14:43,661
[SPEAKER_64]: Together!

2212
03:14:44,061 --> 03:14:46,581
[SPEAKER_64]: One, two, three, Mustangs!

2213
03:14:46,601 --> 03:14:48,602
[SPEAKER_55]: Hello, my name is Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

2214
03:14:48,662 --> 03:14:52,323
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm the mayor of Medford, Mass., home of the mighty Medford Mustangs.

2215
03:14:52,723 --> 03:14:57,464
[SPEAKER_55]: They say up here in Medford country that our veins bleed blue and white, and we know you're the same.

2216
03:14:57,944 --> 03:15:00,585
[SPEAKER_55]: We're here to support you in rebuilding your community.

2217
03:15:00,825 --> 03:15:05,186
[SPEAKER_55]: I'm here with our athletic director, Bobby Maloney, and our head baseball coach, Mike Nestor.

2218
03:15:05,566 --> 03:15:07,026
[SPEAKER_55]: Bobby, would you like to say a few words?

2219
03:15:07,446 --> 03:15:11,209
[SPEAKER_89]: Yeah, Barry Campbell, from one Mustang to another, we're coming with some help.

2220
03:15:12,370 --> 03:15:18,475
[SPEAKER_89]: The citizens in the school department are going to step up, and you're going to get a nice truckload from Local 25 headed your way.

2221
03:15:19,095 --> 03:15:19,476
[SPEAKER_89]: Good luck.

2222
03:15:19,716 --> 03:15:22,738
[SPEAKER_89]: Keep us in touch, and thoughts and prayers are with the entire community.

2223
03:15:24,580 --> 03:15:24,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael.

2224
03:15:25,220 --> 03:15:27,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Coach Kelly Meade, baseball coach.

2225
03:15:27,542 --> 03:15:29,744
[SPEAKER_22]: From one to another, we're here, we got your back.

2226
03:15:30,044 --> 03:15:32,246
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to show you what Mustang Strong is all about.

2227
03:15:33,407 --> 03:15:34,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Mustang Strong!

2228
03:15:44,392 --> 03:15:49,678
[SPEAKER_27]: From our Mustangs in Medford to your Mustangs in Texas, you have our support.

2229
03:15:50,158 --> 03:15:50,719
[SPEAKER_27]: We're with you.

2230
03:15:51,139 --> 03:15:51,920
[SPEAKER_27]: Go Mustangs!

2231
03:15:52,881 --> 03:15:54,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Houston, we stand with you.

2232
03:15:54,483 --> 03:15:56,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Mustangs!

2233
