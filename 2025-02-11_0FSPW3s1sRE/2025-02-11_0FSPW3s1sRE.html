    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=267.983s">That</a>  seems correct from what's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=270.645s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=272.106s">That's</a>  all I needed to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=273.047s">Motion</a>  to approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=274.388s">OK,</a>  motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by, OK, so this is just for the actual field trip allowance by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=283.215s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=284.016s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=284.896s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=287.239s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=288.54s">We</a>  do not have any reports of subcommittees. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=291.641s">We</a>  have report of our superintendent, proposal to update MHS graduation and competency determination requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=300.625s">So</a>  I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Galussi, our interim superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=306.247s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=307.288s">I'm</a>  just going to give one minute for, Dr. Cushing's gonna help me by displaying the slide deck. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=315.411s">And</a>  I'm just going to start <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=317.671s">by</a>  giving a little bit of historical background. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=320.853s">So</a>  on the agenda for this evening, I'm going to provide you with the historical context about why this proposal is coming forward to this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=332.54s">We're</a>  going to talk a little bit about what question two on the ballot was in November, the proposal for updating the statute language for Medford Public Schools, Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=346.129s">an</a>  update on MCAS participation and some further considerations regarding this updated policy proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=355.257s">So,</a>  Dr. Cushing, could you please just advance to slide three? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=360.341s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=362.643s">Much</a>  appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=364.505s">So,</a>  just as a brief <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=368.114s">To</a>  frame this a little bit, Massachusetts Education Reform Law of 1993 aimed to increase accountability across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=378.163s">And</a>  it did so by establishing a competency determination standard for all high school students to achieve in order to get their graduation from high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=393.423s">That</a>  local control as part of this ed reform was given to school committees as a way to vet and adhere to this policy and deem the graduation appropriate for high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=408.918s">Beginning</a>  in the class of 2003, so 10 years later, MCAS served as the way to meet this competency determination and be the deciding factor in how students were graduating. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=425.923s">So</a>  at that point you had, students had to meet <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=432.89s">for</a>  grade 10 MCAS, and they also had to meet local graduation requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=438.916s">So</a>  since then, there have been some updates to that, and between 2003 and 2009, grade 10 ELA and math scores needed to be needs improvement or higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=451.927s">Between</a>  the years of 2010 and 2020, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=456.219s">they</a>  increased, they just upped the threshold so that they gave a score. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=461.528s">The</a>  scaled score had to be 240 for ELA in math and 220 or above in science. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=470.785s">Most</a>  recently in 2021, coming out of COVID, up until recently, which was last year, the Department of Education moved the threshold again, which is also why we saw a little bit of a dip in scores. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=483.012s">And</a>  so for those three core subtests, ELA, mathematics, and biology for science, students had to be meeting or exceeding. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=494.198s">So</a>  no longer was the scaled score or the needs improvement part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=500.472s">And</a>  then as we know, a motion was put on ballot question two for the November election. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=511.277s">And</a>  if we advance please Dr. Cushing to the next slide, it passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=518.68s">So</a>  59% of the Commonwealth of voters agreed that the MCAS should not serve as the competency determination for high school graduation requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=530.428s">What</a>  I have here is just a screenshot to show you how the vote turned out, and then the old language of the statute with the current new language of the statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=542.915s">So</a>  what you can see here is they've crossed out that it's the assessment tool, which was MCAS, and they've added the new statute, which is saying that in lieu of <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=554.461s">the</a>  competency determination through the MCAS test, it has to be through the coursework of those aligned classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=564.768s">So</a>  if we, let me just, before we advance to the next slide, what that really means is that they still want the competency determination to meet the needs of state frameworks for Common Core in Massachusetts for grade 10, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=584.023s">in</a>  ELA, in math, which they say should be algebra and geometry, which we will talk about, and in science, algebra, excuse me, biology or chemistry. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=597.071s">All</a>  right, so now we go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=600.41s">And</a>  once this passed, and there was a whole lot of work now for districts to do, we had many meetings with a large group of people at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=613.032s">And</a>  I do wanna say special thanks to those people for meeting continuously and doing not only work during these meetings, but also a lot of work outside of the meetings and with their respective departments because educators <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=627.895s">were</a>  brought into these conversations, so I do want to thank Vilma Bobo, David Blauck, Joan Bowen, Marta Cabral, Nicole Chiesa, Rocco Sieri, Kim Clinton, Chad Fallon, Lori Hodgkin, Faiza Khan, Stacey Shulman, Paul Texera, and their respective educators. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=648.786s">And</a>  so we are going to present a proposal to you that we feel aligns with our instructional vision and the requirements of the newly passed mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=660.196s">So</a>  the following slides are going to kind of talk you through how we're updating and we'll meet the needs of the new mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=668.363s">So</a>  the next slide shows you currently right now what our local <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=675.148s">high</a>  school graduation requirements are along with the previous competency determination of the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=682.312s">So</a>  you'll see in order for students to graduate from Medford High School, they have to have four years of English, four years of wellness, four years of math, including geometry and algebra, two, three years of a science, including biology and chemistry, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=699.247s">three</a>  years of social studies, two years of foreign language, one course in fine arts, four years of community service, which accounts to 60 hours, roughly about 15 per year, and then the two requirements for MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=719.341s">That's</a>  what it is currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=720.722s">Are</a>  there any questions on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=723.524s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=724.665s">If</a>  we advance to the next slide, and I have this in two pieces, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=730.165s">We're</a>  not looking right now to wholly change our local graduation requirements, but we do need some updated language because some of that language does not reflect current practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=744.57s">So</a>  English remains at four years, take and pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=749.072s">Mathematics</a>  also continues at four years, take and pass, but we now have shifted to the integrated pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=756.695s">So</a>  instead of, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=759.176s">geometry</a>  and algebra, it now reflects integrated math one, two, and three. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=765.141s">Continued</a>  with four years of wellness. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=768.083s">Continue</a>  with three years of science. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=770.966s">Continue</a>  with social studies, but we also have a new department of education requirement that we're adding in here, which includes the student-led civics project. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=782.756s">Making</a>  sure we've updated <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=785.62s">the</a>  word world language instead of referring to it as foreign language. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=792.063s">The</a>  requirement of, or the difference for CTE remains right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=798.686s">Arts</a>  remains as one course to take and pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=802.227s">And</a>  then there's just a description of community service and the benefits of community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=807.61s">But</a>  the hours of, the total hours of 60, roughly about 15 per year remain the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=814.725s">Before</a>  I move on to the competency determination, are there any questions about these brief language changes? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=819.969s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=823.011s">Member</a>  Itapa? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=824.853s">Member</a>  Itapa? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=826.714s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=828.115s">This</a>  may just be a small, so in the phrasing, is it, and you said roughly, but I just want confirmation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=833.56s">It's</a>  not, it's 60 cumulative, so there could be like 20, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=837.243s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=837.443s">Just</a>  wanted to make sure, because some people may have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=839.745s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=843.23s">Okay,</a>  next slide please. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=847.207s">All</a>  right, so the competency determination, we wanna make sure that we have the language of the statute in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=854.151s">So</a>  that's just the language that's at the top so that it's very framed, what the new statute states, where it is coming from, and how Medford is going to address the competency determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=869.42s">So</a>  if students have previously earned this through <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=873.858s">the</a>  taking and passing of MCAS or the grant of an appeal process, then they have already earned their competency determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=884.147s">So</a>  for students that have not or moving forward, we are saying that students would earn that through the successful completion of grade nine and 10 English language arts coursework as aligned with Massachusetts curriculum frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=902.712s">that</a>  they would take, students would complete and pass grades nine and 10 math coursework, integrated math one and integrated math two aligned with the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks, the successful completion of high school biology coursework aligned with the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks and participation in MCAS, ELA, math and biology tests as assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=931.262s">And</a>  for students that receive a not meeting expectation score, that they would just participate in at least one retest. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=941.767s">I'm</a>  gonna kind of explain that a little bit more as we move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=945.088s">So</a>  the next slide, just so we're understanding the impact that this has for our current class of 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=954.692s">As</a>  previously stated, if they've already earned their competency determination by taking and passing, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=961.437s">the</a>  grade 10 ELA math and biology, they're all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=967.723s">They've</a>  met that competency determination and provided that they've met the local graduation requirements, they will be all set to graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=975.271s">For</a>  students who have not earned their competency determination currently, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=980.103s">then</a>  we have already been going back to do some of that vetting to see if they have successfully taken and completed those courses before. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=990.87s">And</a>  we are, the conversation and the communication with the caregivers is ongoing for that very small group of students that we've already identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1005.244s">The</a>  next slide, because I think it's very important just to kind of frame, is that under ed reform law, which started as No Child Left Behind, then moved to Race to the Top, and is now still ESSA, Every Student Succeeds Act, there's compliance that is put from the federal level onto the states to make sure that we are adhering to <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1034.782s">Common</a>  Core to local frameworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1037.904s">And</a>  so the participation in MCAS has always been a requirement and continues to be a requirement for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1048.351s">And</a>  participation is not optional. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1051.934s">Students</a>  should be taking the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1055.576s">And</a>  so we have been informed that it is still going to be an accountability measure for local districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1065.157s">So</a>  now this mandate has removed MCAS being used as a graduation requirement for competency determination, but it is still going to be used to assess and put a rating to districts in terms of their accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1086.982s">It</a>  also is still going to be used as a qualifier for some scholarships, as well as the seal of biliteracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1096.411s">So</a>  there are some important factors in terms of our students' participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1101.717s">We</a>  have been having some internal conversations and continue to have internal conversations around <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1109.599s">what</a>  that will look like in terms of students knowing that it is no longer a graduation requirement, but it is also an important assessment for them to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1121.827s">So</a>  I just felt it was important, it is for these reasons that we're having the participation be part of the competency determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1133.995s">So</a>  before I get to <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1137.043s">last</a>  slide are there are there questions around this?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1142.525s">Member</a>  Brinley.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1148.627s">So</a>  this year I understand the situation with the class of 2025 and then MCAS participation student participation is required so every student in the district is taking the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1160.359s">That</a>  hasn't changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1162.539s">Participation</a>  is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1164.32s">The</a>  reason that I say that is because I think you see that a lot on social media circulating that MCATs are not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1168.541s">Oh,</a>  just write a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1169.281s">They</a>  don't have to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1170.821s">And</a>  I don't think that that's fair to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1174.362s">I</a>  mean, you know, I also understand the need of a child. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1177.163s">So</a>  like, how do we- That's the clarifier.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1180.063s">So</a>  it's not going to necessarily, the onus necessarily won't be on the student, but it will impact the district.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1187.629s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1187.929s">So</a>  it's not, MCAS is not going to, unless there are students that are going for scholarships that are going to be tied to the performance on the MCAS, it's not going to hold student back. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1198.772s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1199.112s">How</a>  they do on the MCAS won't necessarily hold them back, but it will impact the district.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1206.314s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1206.574s">And</a>  I think that there's maybe this, you know, notion that, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1212.394s">It's</a>  not a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1213.494s">It</a>  is a requirement for every student. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1215.935s">So</a>  I just think that that should be known to the public that it's a requirement for the student, but the student won't be held back from graduation or some of the things that are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1227.859s">for</a>  the student, but also it's necessary for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1230.6s">And</a>  I think maybe if people feel like they don't have to put so much pressure on their child or their child doesn't have to feel so much pressure, I think that's just good to get out there because, you know, it's more our rating versus a student's rating overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1244.143s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1246.004s">That</a>  part is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1246.764s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1247.044s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1247.524s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1250.845s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1255.312s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1256.553s">My</a>  understanding, according to the former secretary of the Department of Education, is that we are required to give the student the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1264.3s">That</a>  is not the same as the student is required to take the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1268.103s">We</a>  are required to give students food. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1270.045s">If</a>  they don't eat it, that's their choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1272.127s">So</a>  I do think it's important that that distinction is made, that <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1279.156s">bringing</a>  the kids in and saying, here's the computer, take the test, is not the same as saying, you have to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1287.022s">And</a>  I think that's sort of where the no-test movement comes from, is that we are required to give it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1296.989s">It</a>  does not mean they're required to take it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1300.672s">And</a>  so we don't have a policy today on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1305.527s">at</a>  elementary school in particular, this has been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1310.19s">You</a>  know, frankly, our computer science curriculum with air quotes is really just to make sure they can take MCAS because they didn't have computer skills in time to be able to do MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1324.42s">But</a>  they shouldn't be having computer skills by that age because American <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1329.804s">Pediatric</a>  Association says that's not developmentally appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1333.746s">So</a>  there's sort of this horrible cycle that we're on, where we're purposefully giving kids an education in something they should not have, because we're mandated to put them in front of these computers to do something. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1349.734s">So</a>  it's all a bit of a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1353.068s">But</a>  I think it's important to understand that the requirement is that we give it to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1357.132s">It</a>  is not required that the kid complete the test or take the test. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1361.296s">And</a>  obviously, most kids want to perform. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1364.853s">Most</a>  kids come to school and want to do well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1367.094s">So</a>  most kids are going to take it, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1369.515s">And</a>  I'm not suggesting they shouldn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1371.236s">But</a>  to say that they must take the test is a different thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1378.619s">It's</a>  like, you can't give kids their grades if they don't do the work in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1383.741s">So</a>  they must do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1386.202s">But</a>  this is not that.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1388.863s">So</a>  the only thing I would say to that, there's a couple of things, and I hope I don't lose <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1394.185s">track</a>  of what I was going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1395.667s">One,</a>  I think this is a very fluid situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1400.816s">So</a>  the governor has just created a committee to continue to vet out <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1407.004s">what</a>  this mandate has now done to districts because it has created a lot of conversation for all of these nuanced pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1415.707s">I</a>  will say, especially at the high school level, but the population of Medford is also fluid and can be transient at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1423.87s">And</a>  so the MCAS does allow in some situations the opportunity for students that may be moving in here that that <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1435.678s">that</a>  that helps to kind of give them some of that level of the competency determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1444.965s">For</a>  us, I hear what you are saying, but right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1449.93s">we</a>  are beholden to the mandate, which only removed the local graduation requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1456.374s">And</a>  so we still are going to have our accountability rating tied to this test. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1463.739s">Now,</a>  maybe this commission through the governor's office or some of the continued work that the Department of Ed is going to do, because it is very fluid, I would not be surprised if we see further guidance by the end of the year or at the earliest <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1479.056s">over</a>  the summer in preparing for the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1482.958s">And</a>  I think, I really highly think this will not be the end of updating our graduation requirements and our competency determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1494.462s">I</a>  think I'm going to be back here probably more than once to update this policy on behalf of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1505.666s">But</a>  I think where we are right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1508.863s">our</a>  accountability rating is still tied to the participation of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1515.008s">And</a>  that is a factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1518.831s">I</a>  understand originally that S and MCAS was supposed to stand for a system and it's really been just a test. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1528.78s">So</a>  I don't think any of us are sitting here saying that the MCAS shows you everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1535.354s">of</a>  what a student is capable of achieving, but it is a data point that is still mandated by the Department of Education in which we're a public school and we have to adhere to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1548.077s">So</a>  that's why I wanted to make sure that I'm providing you with the most updated current information that I have right now.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1563.24s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Pelosi.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1564.957s">So</a>  there's one last slide I can talk through. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1566.699s">And</a>  then if there's further questions, we can still talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1569.923s">But</a>  there's just further considerations that we have had conversations for. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1575.069s">Some</a>  of them are ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1576.751s">And</a>  so just so that you understand the complexity of it, we have had conversations around transfer students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1583.92s">in</a>  terms of obtaining that competency determination if they come into us, let's say in 11th grade or in 12th grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1592.245s">So</a>  there are existing mechanisms within our handbook that we will follow, but there will be collaboration between school leadership and department leadership to make sure that they're vetting and looking at equivalent coursework for approving and adhering to the competency determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1615.259s">Some</a>  nuances for English learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1617.743s">So</a>  graduation requirements for English learners include the successful completion and appropriate EL level course and participation in both MCAS subject matter tests and the access test. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1630.448s">For</a>  our out-of-district students, it's a very similar process for the transfer that we're adhering to for transfer students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1638.334s">So</a>  we will accept equivalent coursework and that will have a collaborative approval process through, again, high school leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1649.882s">department</a>  leaders, and the director of student services. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1654.504s">And</a>  for the students, students between those years of 2003 and 2024 that did not receive a high school diploma because they didn't meet the competency determination of passing the MCAS, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1670.292s">The</a>  high school team has been diligently working to gather that data so that we have that list of students that we will be able to, and actually that's ongoing, that they're reaching out to and making some plans if they want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1687.212s">meet</a>  the competency determination to change that status for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1691.793s">So</a>  that's work that's ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1696.395s">And</a>  that concludes, that's the final slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1699.555s">So</a>  if there are any other further questions, I'm happy to help answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1705.717s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1706.937s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1708.238s">One</a>  of the things that I don't <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1710.102s">talked</a>  about a lot is that our students with significant disabilities that took the ALT MCAS, they never received a real diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1721.188s">It</a>  was not allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1723.389s">So</a>  they could perform all of the requirements we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1727.231s">And</a>  because they use the ALT MCAS, they would get a certificate, but not a diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1732.934s">And</a>  I'm thrilled that the end of the MCAS requirement means that those students who have <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1738.28s">earned</a>  a diploma can get a diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1740.862s">And</a>  I think that that's important to recognize is that that change wasn't really part of the campaign to get rid of the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1749.348s">I</a>  mean, I know some folks were campaigning in that, but for the most part, it wasn't the main push for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1756.973s">But</a>  I think it's a super important feature of getting rid of this requirement.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1763.528s">I</a>  just want to make sure that it's, I agree, but I also want to make sure that in terms of our local requirement and the CD, so both of those things have to happen in order to get a diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1779.812s">And</a>  the competency determination means that you are able to pass the grade level content within those subject areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1790.036s">So</a>  any student that's able to meet grade level requirement for integrated math one and two, ELA ninth and 10th grade, and biology, then they've met that competency determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1804.061s">And</a>  then we're moving on to the local requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1808.063s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1810.502s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Galusi. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1811.703s">Are</a>  you looking for a vote?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1813.404s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1813.764s">Is</a>  there a motion?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1815.105s">Just</a>  because this would update the policy that is, I believe, IKF for Medford School Committee policy.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1824.211s">So</a>  motion for approval to update the graduation competency policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1829.035s">I</a>  have a question about</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1834.71s">I</a>  was potentially going to motion to take 2025-03 out of order, because that either seems to be a sending this to the subcommittee or just updating the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1846.918s">So</a>  I see this is coming up on the agenda, but maybe Member Ruseau could clarify whether this is a policy update or a recommendation to send it to the subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1860.106s">Yeah,</a>  Member Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1862.368s">So</a>  it's not unusual for superintendents to actually just recommend policy updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1867.956s">And</a>  I mean, that hasn't been the practice in Medford for as long as I've been on, but I actually appreciate it greatly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1875.708s">The</a>  only thing I would say is that the policy <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1880.262s">know,</a>  it's a lovely formatted document, which is not what our policy service is particularly good at, and it lacks the policy required policy information at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1890.889s">So</a>  I mean, if the committee is okay with approving this as amended to include the policy information section at the end, then I'm fine with us not having more meetings about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1903.358s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1905.393s">That's,</a>  I guess, an amendment to the recommendation to approve the policy, first reading?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1911.575s">It</a>  would be just to update that language. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1913.475s">So</a>  the chart that's in here that shows the local graduation requirements and the MCAS, it would just be to update the local graduation requirements, which is really just a shift in how we're labeling the requirements and the competency determination.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1935.89s">I</a>  mean, I kind of do want to just send this still to subcommittee just because like the current policy is, you know, refers to 2004 and 2005 and format wise, like I feel like the whole policy we currently have has to be thrown out and some of that stuff still has to be incorporated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1952.538s">Like</a>  are the actual credit requirements that are in the policy, are those still correct?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1958.6s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1958.84s">Okay,</a>  well that's good to know.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1960.901s">They</a>  reflect the current need and practice right now.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1965.063s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1967.444s">I</a>  mean, I don't really, I mean, based on that, I don't think we need a subcommittee, but I do think that like bringing this back in the proper policy format next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1976.189s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1976.709s">Makes</a>  sense to me, if that's okay with the members, but I would, well, it needs two readings anyways, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1984.853s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1986.594s">So</a>  for the next meeting, I can put it in that format.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1990.095s">Yeah,</a>  I can help you with that.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=1992.157s">No</a>  problem.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2000.588s">So</a>  the final is a motion to hold subcommittee meeting to make.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2006.933s">I</a>  think the second reading will be next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2009.495s">OK,</a>  so this motion for approval then by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Olapade. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2020.003s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2021.764s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2022.205s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2024.346s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2025.407s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2025.887s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2026.328s">Good</a>  presentation, Dr. Galusi. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2030.396s">We</a>  have another report under superintendent reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2037.246s">Number</a>  two would be summer fund sliding scale report by Dr. Cushing, assistant superintendent, and Noelle Velez, our director of finance.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2049.027s">Good</a>  evening, Madam Mayor, members of the School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2051.869s">As</a>  you may remember, two weeks ago, we had a motion for a summer fund budget and also to include the exploration of a sliding scale and rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2064.938s">So</a>  tonight, I'm here to discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2069.0s">So</a>  first, all the information contained in this report was is shipped from the previous report is shared at the bottom, just for context in case you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2078.944s">Also</a>  on the call with Noel and myself this evening is Mr. Petrelis, the director of the program, so he can jump in and add any he wished he could be in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2089.668s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2091.14s">more</a>  than fine having him virtual. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2093.943s">So</a>  I just want to get into it right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2096.445s">So</a>  annually, the summer fund begins with a zero budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2100.148s">We're</a>  changing our practice on that beginning FY26 so that we can start having Medford's summer fund program be a self-funding, self-sustaining program as it has been, but so that the revenue is not just lumped in with all community schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2117.063s">that</a>  the program can build year over year, can really look at programming and those things and enhancing programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2127.806s">Summer</a>  Fund provides nine hours of childcare per week, every day, nine hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2134.428s">So</a>  currently the fee is $200 or $40 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2139.69s">That</a>  makes the per hour cost for childcare $4.44. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2144.991s">An</a>  increase to $250 makes the rate $5.55, and an increase to $2.75, which we are taking off the table, makes the hourly rate for $6.11. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2155.06s">I</a>  wanted to provide the calculation simply because it was in there last time, but there seemed to be very little appetite for that at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2166.07s">Rate</a>  card requested is $50 to $250, but we will go through the rest of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2171.595s">So</a>  last year, we had 249 students who participated in multiple weeks of summer fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2182.443s">Some</a>  students may have participated less than a full week at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2186.685s">That's</a>  15 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2188.707s">But</a>  17 enrollees were there for all six weeks of the program last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2198.373s">Staffing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2201.125s">There</a>  were a total number of 25 staffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2203.77s">That</a>  staffing level, and Mr. Petrallis, if you want to jump in on a point, that staffing level may have fluctuated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2210.595s">All</a>  right, based on the number of enrollees, but the maximum number of staff that were employed was 25 Councilors, an assistant director of two, and director of one. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2224.699s">And</a>  counseling fluctuates week by week based on demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2229.36s">Here</a>  you have the specific enrollments with the payroll as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2235.562s">So</a>  just as an example, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2238.874s">First</a>  week, 71 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2240.575s">The</a>  tuition that week is $160 because it goes up against the 4th of July week, that holiday we don't charge people for. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2246.737s">I</a>  put in potential just because of some checks that may have not cleared, a small number of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2257.741s">But</a>  so $11,360 potential and our payroll that week <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2263.623s">was</a>  $11,288.67. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2264.464s">And</a>  you'll see the breakdown of the numbers moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2271.67s">So</a>  our—and then potential revenue versus potential price points, based on FY24 numbers, you see the $200 per week <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2287.357s">$250</a>  per week and $275 per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2290.298s">That</a>  is based on the numbers that we had last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2293.22s">We</a>  have no enrollees right now because we have not opened registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2296.841s">So</a>  that's what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2299.882s">The</a>  overall budget at a glance. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2302.383s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2303.024s">Let</a>  me just clear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2305.3s">So</a>  we had, based on last year's numbers, we have an expected revenue this year of hopefully $131,960. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2311.823s">This</a>  is all based on the 200. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2315.964s">I'm</a>  sorry, this is for FY20. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2317.565s">It's</a>  very confusing, even for myself at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2320.646s">looking</a>  at the summer of the FY's as they change. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2323.828s">But</a>  for the FY 25 summer fund budget last year, we brought in $131,960 with checks not clearing in the neighborhood of $1,200 for total summer fund revenue of $130,760. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2341.702s">Salaries</a>  were $96,280, approximate expenses of $8,000, so total summer fund expenses of $104,280. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2346.463s">We</a>  then had $26,480 in revenue generated. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2348.304s">This</a>  does not consider chargebacks that we do for other programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2364.847s">for</a>  electricity and water would be the two primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2368.169s">The</a>  payrolls do include the overtimes for custodial cleanup at the end of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2380.537s">Potential</a>  revenue from other programs, I just want to say that we put this in here so that we're being transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2388.184s">Our</a>  EL program has students attend after their programs finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2393.529s">We</a>  do not currently charge those families. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2397.092s">We</a>  consider that to be a real statement of values to support vulnerable populations, as well as extended school year programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2406.52s">and</a>  that option is there for families, all right, but we do not currently charge for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2411.742s">So</a>  we wanted to quantify that in some way, but I don't want anyone to think that we're seeking to get these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2423.426s">All</a>  right, before I move forward into the sliding scale, Mr. Petrellis or Noel, is there anything you'd like to add or anything that I've missed at this stage?</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2436.088s">No,</a>  I thought you'd done an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2437.39s">This</a>  is Anthony Petralas, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2439.672s">Oh,</a>  I can do video today. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2441.754s">Yeah,</a>  so everything's pretty accurate for what we see on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2444.717s">I</a>  mean, the biggest thing, and Dr. Cushing kind of just stressed it at the end, you know, the EL program, the extended school year program, just to give you an idea of how that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2454.006s">Extended</a>  school year, the EL program ends around 12 o'clock, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2458.69s">Two</a>  years ago we had 20 kids it was a trial last year double the amount, just keep in mind, you know, obviously he said it best like we're not looking to charge by any means to a degree, but I also keep in mind if I have 135 140 kids that week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2474.496s">adding</a>  on 40 kids in the afternoon brings our numbers up dramatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2478.978s">So</a>  it is a huge undertaking for our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2482.199s">I</a>  just wanna put that out there on top of the other things that I'm responsible for our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2487.121s">I</a>  now become responsible for tutoring schedules with extended school year, getting kids to where they need to go, having a program that comes with us and attaches onto us. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2495.824s">So</a>  there is a lot that kind that happens in the afternoon with our camp as well that I'm glad Dr. Cushion mentioned to everybody.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2508.64s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2509.461s">So</a>  yeah, are you done with your presentation?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2511.842s">Nope.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2512.042s">Well,</a>  sliding scale, but feel free to.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2514.363s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2515.544s">I</a>  just read this earlier, so I knew what the final request was based on all of your research and pulling the data together. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2522.348s">So</a>  I didn't know what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2525.33s">Oh,</a>  member Rousseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2527.831s">Member</a>  Branley?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2529.752s">This</a>  all says FY25. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2530.333s">Should</a>  you say FY24?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2534.23s">I</a>  mean, it starts, the program starts.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2536.892s">We</a>  have actual enrollment numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2541.196s">Aren't</a>  those?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2543.097s">Summer,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2546.6s">It's</a>  FY20. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2547.241s">Are</a>  these the numbers from last summer?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2549.863s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2550.524s">So</a>  that's FY24. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2551.224s">No,</a>  25. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2552.785s">That's</a>  FY25.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2553.306s">Sorry,</a>  I messed it up earlier, so I didn't confuse everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2556.368s">I</a>  accept responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2558.07s">It</a>  is FY25.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2559.837s">The</a>  prediction stuff is that much. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2561.258s">Oh,</a>  I hate that so much.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2562.439s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2562.759s">Yeah,</a>  especially when it's just. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2567.183s">And</a>  the sliding scale also hurt my brain. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2569.685s">I'm</a>  not going to lie.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2572.947s">I</a>  just have a point of clarification, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2574.729s">I</a>  do want to just say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2577.848s">The</a>  director of EL Paltek, Sarah, also uses some of his title three funding to help support the staffing needs in the afternoon at summer fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2587.775s">I</a>  believe last summer it was one teacher and two assistants or aides, just so that there is an additional support added to the staffing.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2599.983s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2602.805s">Member</a>  Branley.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2604.645s">I</a>  think that that was just clarified my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2606.267s">So</a>  there's someone coming from the EL program to help Mr. Petralas every afternoon with these 40 extra children. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2613.233s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2613.613s">Do</a>  we think that's enough people?</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2617.036s">It</a>  was three additional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2618.777s">I</a>  can get more clarification on the amount of time they were there the entire time, but I know that it was one teacher and two aides. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2628.966s">One</a>  teacher and two aides. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2631.474s">Yes,</a>  yes, in addition to the summer fund staffing.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2636.317s">So</a>  are they in charge of, Mr. Petrellis just mentioned, you know, tutoring and all of this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2643.262s">Is</a>  that something that they're responsible for? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2644.603s">It</a>  seems like he's taking care of that part.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2646.345s">They</a>  provide the tutoring, but as you know, Mr. Petrellis helps ferry the kids to the rooms and where they need to be.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2654.77s">Yes,</a>  the services, the academic services are in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2659.253s">And</a>  then the social piece is through summer fun in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2663.695s">And</a>  Mr. Teixeira has provided some additional staffing for the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2671.499s">And</a>  does that come out of his budget?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2672.7s">Yes,</a>  Title III.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2673.981s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2674.121s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2674.601s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2677.002s">So</a>  sliding scale, currently two programs within Medford Public Schools use a long existing <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2687.153s">Sliding</a>  scale documents are on our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2691.999s">And</a>  those discount levels based on income levels are 20%, 50%, 70%. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2695.422s">So</a>  again, before and after care and meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2698.686s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2707.105s">We</a>  also took into consideration here, just so that you're aware, we are now a community eligibility provision district when it comes to food services. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2718.769s">What</a>  used to drive a lot of financial decisions in district was if a child was considered a free meal, a reduced meal, or full pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2731.208s">Community</a>  eligibility provision only considers, we can get the numbers for reduced, but they only consider free now for part of the to be eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2741.233s">What</a>  the community eligibility provision does is it takes away the burden of parents having to fill out those forms every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2748.421s">And</a>  it also takes away the burden of the district to have to do a verification process of between 5% and 10% of those forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2757.783s">A</a>  random selection every year was supposed to be done of verifications of those forms to make sure, like, if Mr. Cushing filled it out and you did a random sampling to verify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2770.326s">Currently,</a>  38% of the Medford public schools <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2774.574s">are</a>  considered free under the federal guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2778.276s">So</a>  62% are considered full pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2781.577s">I</a>  just use those numbers as an illustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2784.779s">So</a>  if we're to extrapolate those numbers, though, and say, well, 38% of students in summer fun, just using statistics, would be probably considered to be free, we'd have to make a decision as to what should the reduction be. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2804.836s">using</a>  the 20%, 50%, 70% discount numbers, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2806.658s">At</a>  20%, at $250, a student would be asked to pay $200, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2811.661s">So</a>  they would be asked to pay $200 at the 20% level. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2814.563s">At</a>  the 50% level, they'd be asked to pay $125. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2817.725s">At</a>  the 70% discount level, they'd be asked to pay $75. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2832.827s">The</a>  corresponding increase based on a sliding scale for a self-funding program would mean that we would need to basically charge $425 to offset the students at 70% reduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2852.234s">But</a>  then we would not be asking for income from everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2855.855s">So</a>  it would have to be $425 to make sure that we are covering our costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2863.323s">And</a>  speaking with Mr. Petrales, that is an exorbitant sum. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2868.849s">And</a>  what we're recommending is the $50 increase, which will allow the director and the assistant director <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2878.045s">to</a>  maintain affordability for Medford families and for us to make sure he offers scholarships now for us to make sure that that process is formalized more so than it already may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2891.553s">And</a>  this will also allow us to take a look at the hourly rate of salaries for our Councilors and the overall stipend of directors, assistant directors and others, but then also to expand programming based on the numbers that were <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2905.288s">previously</a>  showed of revenue increasing to about $168,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2908.931s">I</a>  worry with a sliding scale at this point, and not to say that I wouldn't recommend its consideration in the future, but I worry a sliding scale at this point that with right now summer funds starting with a $0 balance, that the financial burden would fall back on the district <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2932.242s">or</a>  other community schools operations to try to make sure that we're able to fund the summer fund program for the six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2941.684s">If</a>  for some reason we misjudge, we over scholarship or do those types of situations.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2952.867s">Member</a>  Branley, what was our rate for non-residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2960.615s">from</a>  last time? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2962.397s">We</a>  had it at $300. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2964.52s">It</a>  says your non-resident rate is open for discussion, but we recommend $300 at this point.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2969.967s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2970.127s">So</a>  is that where we've been? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2971.069s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2972.43s">It</a>  wasn't different. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2973.051s">This</a>  is not different. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2973.812s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2973.932s">It's</a>  been the same.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2975.835s">The</a>  same as Nedford Residence?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2977.177s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2980.998s">If</a>  I could just add something, if I could add something, it wasn't until after COVID that the first time we've ever really gotten people outside of Medford very interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2989.16s">And</a>  I mentioned last time, it's a really small number that we have in the course of a summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2995.341s">So</a>  this is something that's been newer the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=2998.122s">So</a>  it's something we've had to kind of add and adjust because we've never really had kids from the outside of the city of Medford attend our camp before.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3007.851s">But</a>  I also think Mr. Petrala's office is a great program now with the addition of the school nutrition program offering meals and snacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3017.296s">It</a>  offers, I mean, many of you probably had your children go to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3021.838s">It's</a>  a great program.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3024.779s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3028.081s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3031.242s">My</a>  math is, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3032.923s">not</a>  necessarily in agreement with your math here. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3036.227s">So</a>  what I looked at was if we accept the recommendation to go to $250, but we essentially also accept the 20% discount, which would essentially hold tuition at where it was last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3054.553s">If</a>  I said 38% of our students would pay $200 a week and 62% of our students would pay $250 a week using the 684, I come up with a net potential revenue of $158,004. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3060.035s">If</a>  I shift that to say half of our students pay $200 and half pay $250, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3080.487s">I</a>  come up with 153,900. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3083.208s">So</a>  while I agree that the 70% discount is not affordable, I am not seeing how the 20% discount would not be viable.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3095.513s">Just</a>  to be clear, I did not do that extrapolation based on the <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3101.308s">38%</a>  and the 62%. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3103.511s">But</a>  it's also, I think, a choice of the committee to say, right now, it rests with the Director of Community Schools and the Director of Summer Fund to, as parents or caregivers, bring need forward to respond to the need and provide at the individual level. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3124.835s">So</a>  if a parent, family, caregivers make the case that, you know, we really need an opportunity here for our child, but we can't afford it, the program works with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3137.958s">But</a>  formalizing it is always.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3140.739s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3141.139s">I</a>  mean, I think my concern with that is there's, you know, lots of places in our storied history in Medford where people point to lack of transparency, lack of accountability, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3152.155s">cherry</a>  picking, favoritism, you name it, it comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3155.137s">So</a>  I do think from a programming perspective, I understand that Mr. Petrellis has the best of intentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3163.802s">But</a>  if somebody were to bring an allegation forward, that sits with this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3168.865s">And</a>  I would really rather avoid putting Mr. Petrellis in a situation where he's having to defend trying to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3175.328s">So</a>  I do think there need to be clear rules and I think there need to be clearly published tuitions that accompany those rules so that the rules of engagement for everybody are clear and parents who may or may not feel comfortable saying to Mr. Petrellis, hey, I need some help, like being willing and able to say, hey, I need some help requires an immense amount of <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3198.174s">like</a>  understanding of the system versus like, here are the two programs, here are these possibilities for you so that people can do their homework and understand that if A, then B, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3211.144s">Like</a>  if I meet this, then I get X versus I have to go talk to somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3216.208s">What</a>  does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3216.989s">Am</a>  I making a case? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3218.05s">Am</a>  I trying to convince him? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3219.171s">Do</a>  I need to buy him candy? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3220.332s">Like</a>  what is like, it sort of conjures up a lot of things that people <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3224.555s">get</a>  scared about and then frankly don't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3226.696s">It</a>  probably also contributes to the bounced checks that we see, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3231.277s">Those</a>  could be families who simply couldn't afford to send their kid, but had no choice, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3237.359s">Needed</a>  childcare. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3238.659s">So</a>  my math says, even if half of our students need support, our total tuition, either 153,000 or 158,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3252.272s">would</a>  still be $20,000 more than last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3257.205s">And</a>  if payroll is only $96, there's a lot of room there to make those adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3262.788s">So</a>  unless I'm missing something, my motion would be to hold tuition at $200 for those who can demonstrate financial need, to increase tuition for everybody else to $250, and to increase tuition for non-residents to $300 a week.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3288.265s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3289.846s">So</a>  families who can demonstrate financial need through eligibility in what would otherwise be free and reduced lunch, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3300.152s">200,</a>  which is the same as last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3302.993s">All</a>  other families will see an increase from 200 to 250. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3308.676s">Out-of-town</a>  participants, we love you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3312.799s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3314.3s">It's</a>  a $300 a week tuition.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3318.155s">and</a>  still a very good deal.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3320.516s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3320.676s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3320.876s">Motion</a>  for approval seconded by Member Reinfeld. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3323.138s">Let</a>  me just go to Noel who wants to comment.</p>

    <p>[Noel Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3328.1s">Thank</a>  you, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3328.821s">Sorry</a>  I couldn't be there in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3332.063s">But</a>  Jenny, thank you so much for what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3335.218s">If</a>  I can have a little bit of clarity and ask a question, what date would the school committee like for myself and Peter to use regarding a student eligibility when we run our direct certification? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3347.283s">Because</a>  we run those quarterly, so we can either use a December or an April 1st date to dictate how a family qualifies for these reduced prices, depending on enrollment and things of that nature, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3362.75s">that's</a>  that would be my only thing I'd want to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3364.931s">I'm</a>  going if with the recommendation to sliding scale so we have a so we have a date to use the proper report and notify families in a timely manner.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3375.194s">So</a>  I would amend my motion to say as established on April on the April 1st reports for financial eligibility.</p>

    <p>[Noel Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3385.878s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3387.218s">From</a>  December to April so I want to use the what is sort of closest to</p>

    <p>[John Intoppa]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3394.833s">I'll</a>  also add that.</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3402.575s">So</a>  I agree with that and the reason behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3405.115s">My</a>  only question is whether that poses a, if we're looking to be opening registration in January, are we concerned that that would affect people's ability to commit or our ability to guarantee a spot?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3421.64s">I'm</a>  not worried about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3422.961s">In</a>  all honesty, if we can still open in January, we can let people know about the opportunity for scholarshipping as well as, and look to support families. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3437.552s">I</a>  don't see it as an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3439.634s">I</a>  think that by going to January 1st is only gonna help families who, if you've ever been sitting online for these camps, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3451.63s">Good</a>  Lord.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3454.992s">And</a>  so we haven't opened registration yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3458.954s">So</a>  once this is finalized, it seems like it's going to be supported tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3464.437s">Then</a>  we're going to advertise an open registration for when?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3470.3s">As</a>  soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3471.061s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3471.601s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3474.442s">Member</a>  Reinfeld?</p>

    <p>[Erika Reinfeld]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3478.234s">Will</a>  this opening of registration coincide with other summer programs? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3482.616s">I</a>  don't know if jumpstart dates are set or other.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3486.018s">This</a>  will be early, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3487.498s">Earlier.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3488.339s">Usually</a>  start thinking about it in May.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3490.94s">Jumpstart</a>  dates are finalizing right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3494.662s">So</a>  I think we'll have that update within a week or two, definitely after the vacation period, if not by the end of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3503.066s">The</a>  only thing I would say is I don't know <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3506.198s">As</a>  Director Valez said, the report is run quarterly, so I think we would also have some preliminary information that we could start to have some of the understanding as to where the families are that may need potential support, and then it would be able to be a finalized list as of April.</p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3535.373s">Can</a>  I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3537.255s">It's</a>  Anthony on the Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3538.516s">Um,</a>  I mean, I'm not trying to be funny, but like, so what does that, I just don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3542.681s">Like,</a>  so what does that mean for registration as far as like what we would have to do next? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3546.525s">I'm</a>  more just like, I guess I got to hear it to kind of understand what the next steps would be if everything does get approved as far as figuring a lot of that out.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3556.69s">I</a>  think we'd update all the forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3558.914s">And</a>  then once everything's ready to go, release it to the public for registration.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3565.346s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3568.191s">Memogram.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3573.738s">My</a>  my impression as well Anthony is that the communications team can support some of that work, because I think last time last two weeks ago whenever that was we also talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3585.576s">That</a>  the idea of. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3589.244s">allowing</a>  all of this to happen in an online format so there's no checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3594.328s">So</a>  all of that I think is going to require support from Will and the website team anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3599.512s">So</a>  I think putting all of that together as a package is something that you can <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3605.237s">expect</a>  assistance with from central administration.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3607.918s">We</a>  have been working just so everyone's full transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3610.9s">We've</a>  been working with our website vendor on two specific options. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3615.762s">One</a>  that is available to us right now through the forms functionality of our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3620.044s">We</a>  already can accept payments and then we're also looking at an enrollment package <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3626.487s">with</a>  our website as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3628.347s">Probably</a>  more to come on that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3630.988s">But</a>  just so that everyone's clear, we're trying to make it so that people don't have to stand in lines, people don't have to write checks, and that we can move into the 21st century. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3642.01s">I</a>  do just also want to check through the wonders of modern technology and just wanted to verify. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3647.611s">We</a>  can run CEP anytime. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3649.512s">We</a>  run it quarterly. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3650.732s">We</a>  can run it anytime through our food service director as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3657.538s">So</a>  we will go with the April 1st date, because I think that's a good standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3661.219s">But</a>  as families come in, we are able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3668.28s">I</a>  mean, there will be one, I think, not to take up any more airtime, but one of the great things about Summer Fund is the ability for a person to walk in. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3679.882s">And</a>  so I think there will be some level of checks. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3683.662s">We'll</a>  have to see how a day of registration can work using the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3687.663s">However,</a>  this should reduce a significant level of stress that has been on Mr. Petrellis and hopefully making this an easier process.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3698.869s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3699.49s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3700.07s">Once</a>  we advertise the right way, more people are bound to do it online and take that stress away. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3705.993s">So</a>  there's a motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeld, as amended by Member Graham to make it the April 1st reports for eligibility date <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3717.368s">$250</a>  for those with financial need, $200 for those with financial need, $250 for everybody else, and if you're out of town, $300. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3727.543s">All</a>  those in favor, would you like a roll call? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3730.698s">No,</a>  we don't need a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3731.738s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3732.939s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3733.299s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3734.719s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3735.879s">And</a>  Mayor, can I just make one more comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3738.46s">If</a>  you're going to change the salary stipends associated with the program, can you bring them to us so that we can have an understanding of what those are before they go into effect? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3750.323s">Because</a>  we are supposed to, I think we're supposed to be in approval of all of those things.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3754.624s">We</a>  would, I would not increase the salary or stipend without bringing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3759.365s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3759.765s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3760.045s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3760.665s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Anthony Petrelis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3761.326s">Can</a>  I ask one more question? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3762.507s">I</a>  know we just voted on it, but it was something I wanted to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3764.449s">I</a>  just don't want to be rude and interrupt anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3767.732s">Kids</a>  who go to like Catholic school or private school outside of like that live in Medford, but go to a school in Medford like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3773.578s">I'm</a>  just more asking opinion than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3776.14s">What</a>  would be or would that be considered out of district as well?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3781.737s">Wow,</a>  what an interesting wrinkle. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3783.558s">I</a>  think if they're residents, they're residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3786.079s">They</a>  live in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3787.979s">They</a>  get the resident rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3789.74s">But</a>  I'd be super interested to know what the enrollment breakdown is, actually, which is a totally separate conversation for another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3795.722s">But</a>  I think that would actually be really fascinating to learn about.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3799.803s">But</a>  also, Mr. Petrelis, maybe we could work to help recruit those kids back to our school district.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3868.593s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3869.174s">We</a>  all, I think, received some emails from our color guard students who were talking about this upcoming trip to Pennsylvania and <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3880.514s">One</a>  of the things that brought up for me was really around some of the one-off actions that we've taken as a committee over the last couple of years, albeit we had lesser money to rely on, which we no longer have. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3896.821s">But</a>  we have funded out-of-state field trips in certain instances based upon people coming to the podium and making a request and for us saying like, <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3908.773s">want</a>  students to have to go out and fundraise and miss trips in order to be able, you know, in order to be able to send some but not all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3917.343s">So</a>  with that money source drying up and with sort of a broad acknowledgement that there's a lot of field trips across the district and there's things like <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3928.527s">nationals</a>  for athletics and nationals for band and color guard and the ethics bowl and the robotics competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3936.412s">There's</a>  all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3937.992s">And</a>  we have not set a policy around what we think we should be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3945.177s">And</a>  I think I would love to say for us to be able to say, we should pay for these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3950.7s">But</a>  before we do that, we should think about what a policy might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3955.843s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3957.393s">if</a>  we are going to bring forward a recommendation to pay for things, obviously that has to be budgeted and all the other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3962.795s">And</a>  we would need to understand like, what is the potential cost of such a policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3968.378s">So</a>  this is just simply to say that the rules and policy subcommittee will take this up and we'll draft a policy, think about the different kinds of field trips, work with the administration, and then also, you know, think about what the financial impact of whatever the recommendation is so that <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3985.423s">Our</a>  classes, our advisors, our students, like they know what the rules of the road are and it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3992.822s">sort</a>  of a squeaky wheel situation where we have some things being funded and not others. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=3998.706s">So</a>  I, you know, we might have to take some baby steps to get to a reality where we don't have to ask students to fundraise and pay for things. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4008.232s">But</a>  the first step in baby steps is to like decide like where it is that you want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4013.055s">So</a>  my hope is that the policy will help us establish where we want to go and then quantify like what, you know, what are the steps we might take to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4022.44s">This</a>  is just to move it to subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4187.926s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4188.526s">So</a>  as you all know, we worked really hard to get all of our eligibility <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4194.932s">information</a>  into the MSBA in early July. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4198.895s">We</a>  worked with them really from July until December on what is called an enrollment certification, which is essentially the headcount of students that we will build a high school for. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4211.306s">So</a>  our current enrollment at the high school is about 1,200 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4216.675s">And</a>  we've worked really hard with them to demonstrate what we see here in Medford in collaboration with the mayor's office and our head of planning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4229.389s">We've</a>  looked at permitted projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4232.572s">We've</a>  looked at <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4233.985s">future</a>  potential projects we've had conversations, and we certified enrollment with MSBA at 1395 which is almost a 200 student increase which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4244.356s">I</a>  think that's a really sort of nice number and a place for us to grow into. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4251.062s">Now,</a>  the next step in the process is for us to authorize the feasibility study agreement, which is a standard agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4258.049s">It</a>  outlines and reports on things that have already happened, like the approval of $3 million, et cetera, and allows the district to enter into this next phase where we will hire an owner's project manager and a designer to do the feasibility study. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4273.697s">and</a>  this body needs to, is the approving body for the feasibility study funds to be expended in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4281.559s">So</a>  we need to sign that. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4283.759s">This</a>  group will need to sign off on that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4287.66s">And</a>  then the board meeting for the MSBA is the week after February vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4292.941s">I</a>  think it's the 26th or 27th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4294.282s">So</a>  it's my full expectation that the team will recommend to the board <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4301.143s">that</a>  we be invited to the next phase, which is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4305.808s">The</a>  building committee is going to get working starting tomorrow to get ready for those next phase deliverables so we can very quickly get an RFP out the door and be ready to hire owner's project manager and really get to this next phase, which is where like all those meaty questions get answered, which is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4322.4s">So</a>  this group needs to give us authorization to sign that agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4327.901s">Howard,</a>  Attorney Greenspan, has a document he'll fill out. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4331.102s">The</a>  mayor has something that she will sign on behalf of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4334.543s">And</a>  then we will be off to the races for the board meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4338.023s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4338.464s">That</a>  meeting's the 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/0FSPW3s1sRE&t=4339.404s">24th,</a>  thank you.</p>
