00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:04,146
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Galussi, our interim superintendent.

127
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:06,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

128
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:13,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to give one minute for, Dr. Cushing's gonna help me by displaying the slide deck.

129
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:16,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just going to start

130
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:20,693
[SPEAKER_07]: by giving a little bit of historical background.

131
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:31,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the agenda for this evening, I'm going to provide you with the historical context about why this proposal is coming forward to this body.

132
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:44,148
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk a little bit about what question two on the ballot was in November, the proposal for updating the statute language for Medford Public Schools, Medford High School.

133
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:52,975
[SPEAKER_07]: an update on MCAS participation and some further considerations regarding this updated policy proposal.

134
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:58,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dr. Cushing, could you please just advance to slide three?

135
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:00,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

136
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:03,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Much appreciated.

137
00:06:04,505 --> 00:06:05,666
[SPEAKER_07]: So, just as a brief

138
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:17,463
[SPEAKER_07]: To frame this a little bit, Massachusetts Education Reform Law of 1993 aimed to increase accountability across the state.

139
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:29,534
[SPEAKER_07]: And it did so by establishing a competency determination standard for all high school students to achieve in order to get their graduation from high school.

140
00:06:33,423 --> 00:06:47,370
[SPEAKER_07]: That local control as part of this ed reform was given to school committees as a way to vet and adhere to this policy and deem the graduation appropriate for high school students.

141
00:06:48,918 --> 00:07:05,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Beginning in the class of 2003, so 10 years later, MCAS served as the way to meet this competency determination and be the deciding factor in how students were graduating.

142
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:11,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So at that point you had, students had to meet

143
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,855
[SPEAKER_07]: for grade 10 MCAS, and they also had to meet local graduation requirements.

144
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:30,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So since then, there have been some updates to that, and between 2003 and 2009, grade 10 ELA and math scores needed to be needs improvement or higher.

145
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:32,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Between the years of 2010 and 2020,

146
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:41,427
[SPEAKER_07]: they increased, they just upped the threshold so that they gave a score.

147
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:49,000
[SPEAKER_07]: The scaled score had to be 240 for ELA in math and 220 or above in science.

148
00:07:50,785 --> 00:08:02,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Most recently in 2021, coming out of COVID, up until recently, which was last year, the Department of Education moved the threshold again, which is also why we saw a little bit of a dip in scores.

149
00:08:03,012 --> 00:08:13,598
[SPEAKER_07]: And so for those three core subtests, ELA, mathematics, and biology for science, students had to be meeting or exceeding.

150
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:19,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So no longer was the scaled score or the needs improvement part of that.

151
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:29,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And then as we know, a motion was put on ballot question two for the November election.

152
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:38,420
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we advance please Dr. Cushing to the next slide, it passed.

153
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:49,385
[SPEAKER_07]: So 59% of the Commonwealth of voters agreed that the MCAS should not serve as the competency determination for high school graduation requirement.

154
00:08:50,428 --> 00:09:02,415
[SPEAKER_07]: What I have here is just a screenshot to show you how the vote turned out, and then the old language of the statute with the current new language of the statute.

155
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:13,481
[SPEAKER_07]: So what you can see here is they've crossed out that it's the assessment tool, which was MCAS, and they've added the new statute, which is saying that in lieu of

156
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:23,467
[SPEAKER_07]: the competency determination through the MCAS test, it has to be through the coursework of those aligned classes.

157
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:42,820
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we, let me just, before we advance to the next slide, what that really means is that they still want the competency determination to meet the needs of state frameworks for Common Core in Massachusetts for grade 10,

158
00:09:44,023 --> 00:09:55,570
[SPEAKER_07]: in ELA, in math, which they say should be algebra and geometry, which we will talk about, and in science, algebra, excuse me, biology or chemistry.

159
00:09:57,071 --> 00:09:58,852
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so now we go to the next slide.

160
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:11,952
[SPEAKER_07]: And once this passed, and there was a whole lot of work now for districts to do, we had many meetings with a large group of people at the high school level.

161
00:10:13,032 --> 00:10:27,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do wanna say special thanks to those people for meeting continuously and doing not only work during these meetings, but also a lot of work outside of the meetings and with their respective departments because educators

162
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:47,716
[SPEAKER_07]: were brought into these conversations, so I do want to thank Vilma Bobo, David Blauck, Joan Bowen, Marta Cabral, Nicole Chiesa, Rocco Sieri, Kim Clinton, Chad Fallon, Lori Hodgkin, Faiza Khan, Stacey Shulman, Paul Texera, and their respective educators.

163
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:59,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we are going to present a proposal to you that we feel aligns with our instructional vision and the requirements of the newly passed mandate.

164
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:07,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So the following slides are going to kind of talk you through how we're updating and we'll meet the needs of the new mandate.

165
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:12,866
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next slide shows you currently right now what our local

166
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:21,451
[SPEAKER_07]: high school graduation requirements are along with the previous competency determination of the MCAS.

167
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:37,920
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll see in order for students to graduate from Medford High School, they have to have four years of English, four years of wellness, four years of math, including geometry and algebra, two, three years of a science, including biology and chemistry,

168
00:11:39,247 --> 00:11:58,641
[SPEAKER_07]: three years of social studies, two years of foreign language, one course in fine arts, four years of community service, which accounts to 60 hours, roughly about 15 per year, and then the two requirements for MCAS.

169
00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:00,522
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it is currently.

170
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:01,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any questions on this?

171
00:12:03,524 --> 00:12:03,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

172
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:08,808
[SPEAKER_07]: If we advance to the next slide, and I have this in two pieces,

173
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:23,230
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not looking right now to wholly change our local graduation requirements, but we do need some updated language because some of that language does not reflect current practice.

174
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So English remains at four years, take and pass.

175
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:36,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Mathematics also continues at four years, take and pass, but we now have shifted to the integrated pathways.

176
00:12:36,695 --> 00:12:37,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of,

177
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:43,159
[SPEAKER_07]: geometry and algebra, it now reflects integrated math one, two, and three.

178
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Continued with four years of wellness.

179
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Continue with three years of science.

180
00:12:50,966 --> 00:13:00,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Continue with social studies, but we also have a new department of education requirement that we're adding in here, which includes the student-led civics project.

181
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:03,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Making sure we've updated

182
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,102
[SPEAKER_07]: the word world language instead of referring to it as foreign language.

183
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:17,045
[SPEAKER_07]: The requirement of, or the difference for CTE remains right now.

184
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:22,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Arts remains as one course to take and pass.

185
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:26,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's just a description of community service and the benefits of community service.

186
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:33,212
[SPEAKER_07]: But the hours of, the total hours of 60, roughly about 15 per year remain the same.

187
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:39,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I move on to the competency determination, are there any questions about these brief language changes?

188
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:42,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

189
00:13:43,011 --> 00:13:43,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Itapa?

190
00:13:44,853 --> 00:13:45,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Itapa?

191
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:46,915
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

192
00:13:48,115 --> 00:13:53,500
[SPEAKER_05]: This may just be a small, so in the phrasing, is it, and you said roughly, but I just want confirmation.

193
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,962
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, it's 60 cumulative, so there could be like 20, okay.

194
00:13:57,243 --> 00:13:57,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

195
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:59,685
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to make sure, because some people may have questions.

196
00:13:59,745 --> 00:14:00,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

197
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, next slide please.

198
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:13,931
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so the competency determination, we wanna make sure that we have the language of the statute in there.

199
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:28,759
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just the language that's at the top so that it's very framed, what the new statute states, where it is coming from, and how Medford is going to address the competency determination.

200
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,362
[SPEAKER_07]: So if students have previously earned this through

201
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:42,485
[SPEAKER_07]: the taking and passing of MCAS or the grant of an appeal process, then they have already earned their competency determination.

202
00:14:44,147 --> 00:15:01,462
[SPEAKER_07]: So for students that have not or moving forward, we are saying that students would earn that through the successful completion of grade nine and 10 English language arts coursework as aligned with Massachusetts curriculum frameworks.

203
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:29,522
[SPEAKER_07]: that they would take, students would complete and pass grades nine and 10 math coursework, integrated math one and integrated math two aligned with the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks, the successful completion of high school biology coursework aligned with the Massachusetts curriculum frameworks and participation in MCAS, ELA, math and biology tests as assigned.

204
00:15:31,262 --> 00:15:40,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And for students that receive a not meeting expectation score, that they would just participate in at least one retest.

205
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:44,288
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna kind of explain that a little bit more as we move on.

206
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:53,432
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next slide, just so we're understanding the impact that this has for our current class of 2025.

207
00:15:54,692 --> 00:16:00,635
[SPEAKER_07]: As previously stated, if they've already earned their competency determination by taking and passing,

208
00:16:01,437 --> 00:16:07,523
[SPEAKER_07]: the grade 10 ELA math and biology, they're all set.

209
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:14,650
[SPEAKER_07]: They've met that competency determination and provided that they've met the local graduation requirements, they will be all set to graduate.

210
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:19,155
[SPEAKER_07]: For students who have not earned their competency determination currently,

211
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:29,869
[SPEAKER_07]: then we have already been going back to do some of that vetting to see if they have successfully taken and completed those courses before.

212
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:42,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are, the conversation and the communication with the caregivers is ongoing for that very small group of students that we've already identified.

213
00:16:45,244 --> 00:17:13,130
[SPEAKER_07]: The next slide, because I think it's very important just to kind of frame, is that under ed reform law, which started as No Child Left Behind, then moved to Race to the Top, and is now still ESSA, Every Student Succeeds Act, there's compliance that is put from the federal level onto the states to make sure that we are adhering to

214
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:17,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Common Core to local frameworks.

215
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:27,511
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the participation in MCAS has always been a requirement and continues to be a requirement for us.

216
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:31,373
[SPEAKER_07]: And participation is not optional.

217
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:34,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Students should be taking the MCAS.

218
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:44,022
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have been informed that it is still going to be an accountability measure for local districts.

219
00:17:45,157 --> 00:18:05,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So now this mandate has removed MCAS being used as a graduation requirement for competency determination, but it is still going to be used to assess and put a rating to districts in terms of their accountability.

220
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:14,990
[SPEAKER_07]: It also is still going to be used as a qualifier for some scholarships, as well as the seal of biliteracy.

221
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:21,256
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are some important factors in terms of our students' participation.

222
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:27,663
[SPEAKER_07]: We have been having some internal conversations and continue to have internal conversations around

223
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:40,706
[SPEAKER_07]: what that will look like in terms of students knowing that it is no longer a graduation requirement, but it is also an important assessment for them to take.

224
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:52,094
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just felt it was important, it is for these reasons that we're having the participation be part of the competency determination.

225
00:18:53,995 --> 00:18:55,156
[SPEAKER_07]: So before I get to

226
00:18:57,043 --> 00:18:59,784
[SPEAKER_07]: last slide are there are there questions around this?

227
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:03,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Brinley.

228
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:19,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So this year I understand the situation with the class of 2025 and then MCAS participation student participation is required so every student in the district is taking the test.

229
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,399
[SPEAKER_06]: That hasn't changed.

230
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Participation is required.

231
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,521
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason that I say that is because I think you see that a lot on social media circulating that MCATs are not required.

232
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just write a letter.

233
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:30,141
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't have to take it.

234
00:19:30,821 --> 00:19:33,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think that that's fair to the district.

235
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:36,783
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, I also understand the need of a child.

236
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:39,983
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, how do we- That's the clarifier.

237
00:19:40,063 --> 00:19:46,885
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not going to necessarily, the onus necessarily won't be on the student, but it will impact the district.

238
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:47,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

239
00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:58,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not, MCAS is not going to, unless there are students that are going for scholarships that are going to be tied to the performance on the MCAS, it's not going to hold student back.

240
00:19:58,772 --> 00:19:59,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

241
00:19:59,112 --> 00:20:05,553
[SPEAKER_07]: How they do on the MCAS won't necessarily hold them back, but it will impact the district.

242
00:20:06,314 --> 00:20:06,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

243
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:11,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that there's maybe this, you know, notion that,

244
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:13,374
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a requirement.

245
00:20:13,494 --> 00:20:15,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a requirement for every student.

246
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:26,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just think that that should be known to the public that it's a requirement for the student, but the student won't be held back from graduation or some of the things that are necessary.

247
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,580
[SPEAKER_06]: for the student, but also it's necessary for the district.

248
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:43,963
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think maybe if people feel like they don't have to put so much pressure on their child or their child doesn't have to feel so much pressure, I think that's just good to get out there because, you know, it's more our rating versus a student's rating overall.

249
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:45,463
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to make sure that that's true.

250
00:20:46,004 --> 00:20:46,644
[SPEAKER_06]: That part is true.

251
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:47,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

252
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:47,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

253
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:47,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

254
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:51,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Rousseau.

255
00:20:55,312 --> 00:20:55,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

256
00:20:56,553 --> 00:21:04,240
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding, according to the former secretary of the Department of Education, is that we are required to give the student the test.

257
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,242
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not the same as the student is required to take the test.

258
00:21:08,103 --> 00:21:09,905
[SPEAKER_04]: We are required to give students food.

259
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:11,606
[SPEAKER_04]: If they don't eat it, that's their choice.

260
00:21:12,127 --> 00:21:16,791
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think it's important that that distinction is made, that

261
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:25,241
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing the kids in and saying, here's the computer, take the test, is not the same as saying, you have to do this.

262
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:36,969
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's sort of where the no-test movement comes from, is that we are required to give it to them.

263
00:21:36,989 --> 00:21:39,271
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not mean they're required to take it.

264
00:21:40,672 --> 00:21:44,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we don't have a policy today on this.

265
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:49,089
[SPEAKER_04]: at elementary school in particular, this has been an issue.

266
00:21:50,190 --> 00:22:03,599
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, frankly, our computer science curriculum with air quotes is really just to make sure they can take MCAS because they didn't have computer skills in time to be able to do MCAS.

267
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,323
[SPEAKER_04]: But they shouldn't be having computer skills by that age because American

268
00:22:09,804 --> 00:22:13,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Pediatric Association says that's not developmentally appropriate.

269
00:22:13,746 --> 00:22:29,554
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's sort of this horrible cycle that we're on, where we're purposefully giving kids an education in something they should not have, because we're mandated to put them in front of these computers to do something.

270
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:32,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all a bit of a mess.

271
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:36,852
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's important to understand that the requirement is that we give it to them.

272
00:22:37,132 --> 00:22:41,075
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not required that the kid complete the test or take the test.

273
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:43,498
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, most kids want to perform.

274
00:22:44,853 --> 00:22:46,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Most kids come to school and want to do well.

275
00:22:47,094 --> 00:22:48,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So most kids are going to take it, of course.

276
00:22:49,515 --> 00:22:51,016
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not suggesting they shouldn't.

277
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:57,939
[SPEAKER_04]: But to say that they must take the test is a different thing.

278
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:03,241
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you can't give kids their grades if they don't do the work in school.

279
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:05,322
[SPEAKER_04]: So they must do the work.

280
00:23:06,202 --> 00:23:07,183
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is not that.

281
00:23:08,863 --> 00:23:12,845
[SPEAKER_07]: So the only thing I would say to that, there's a couple of things, and I hope I don't lose

282
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,647
[SPEAKER_07]: track of what I was going to say.

283
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:20,676
[SPEAKER_07]: One, I think this is a very fluid situation.

284
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:25,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So the governor has just created a committee to continue to vet out

285
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:34,907
[SPEAKER_07]: what this mandate has now done to districts because it has created a lot of conversation for all of these nuanced pieces.

286
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:43,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say, especially at the high school level, but the population of Medford is also fluid and can be transient at times.

287
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:54,213
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the MCAS does allow in some situations the opportunity for students that may be moving in here that that

288
00:23:55,678 --> 00:24:03,584
[SPEAKER_07]: that that helps to kind of give them some of that level of the competency determination.

289
00:24:04,965 --> 00:24:08,748
[SPEAKER_07]: For us, I hear what you are saying, but right now,

290
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:15,654
[SPEAKER_07]: we are beholden to the mandate, which only removed the local graduation requirement.

291
00:24:16,374 --> 00:24:23,198
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we still are going to have our accountability rating tied to this test.

292
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:38,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, maybe this commission through the governor's office or some of the continued work that the Department of Ed is going to do, because it is very fluid, I would not be surprised if we see further guidance by the end of the year or at the earliest

293
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:42,937
[SPEAKER_07]: over the summer in preparing for the next school year.

294
00:24:42,958 --> 00:24:54,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, I really highly think this will not be the end of updating our graduation requirements and our competency determination.

295
00:24:54,462 --> 00:25:04,586
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm going to be back here probably more than once to update this policy on behalf of the Medford School Committee.

296
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,607
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think where we are right now,

297
00:25:08,863 --> 00:25:13,527
[SPEAKER_07]: our accountability rating is still tied to the participation of our students.

298
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,310
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is a factor.

299
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:27,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand originally that S and MCAS was supposed to stand for a system and it's really been just a test.

300
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:34,304
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think any of us are sitting here saying that the MCAS shows you everything.

301
00:25:35,354 --> 00:25:46,836
[SPEAKER_07]: of what a student is capable of achieving, but it is a data point that is still mandated by the Department of Education in which we're a public school and we have to adhere to.

302
00:25:48,077 --> 00:25:58,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I wanted to make sure that I'm providing you with the most updated current information that I have right now.

303
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Pelosi.

304
00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:06,659
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's one last slide I can talk through.

305
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if there's further questions, we can still talk about it.

306
00:26:09,923 --> 00:26:14,449
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's just further considerations that we have had conversations for.

307
00:26:15,069 --> 00:26:16,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them are ongoing.

308
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:23,119
[SPEAKER_07]: And so just so that you understand the complexity of it, we have had conversations around transfer students.

309
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:31,705
[SPEAKER_07]: in terms of obtaining that competency determination if they come into us, let's say in 11th grade or in 12th grade.

310
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:53,117
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are existing mechanisms within our handbook that we will follow, but there will be collaboration between school leadership and department leadership to make sure that they're vetting and looking at equivalent coursework for approving and adhering to the competency determination.

311
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:57,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Some nuances for English learners.

312
00:26:57,743 --> 00:27:08,617
[SPEAKER_07]: So graduation requirements for English learners include the successful completion and appropriate EL level course and participation in both MCAS subject matter tests and the access test.

313
00:27:10,448 --> 00:27:17,513
[SPEAKER_07]: For our out-of-district students, it's a very similar process for the transfer that we're adhering to for transfer students.

314
00:27:18,334 --> 00:27:29,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So we will accept equivalent coursework and that will have a collaborative approval process through, again, high school leadership.

315
00:27:29,882 --> 00:27:33,524
[SPEAKER_07]: department leaders, and the director of student services.

316
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:48,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And for the students, students between those years of 2003 and 2024 that did not receive a high school diploma because they didn't meet the competency determination of passing the MCAS,

317
00:27:50,292 --> 00:28:04,957
[SPEAKER_07]: The high school team has been diligently working to gather that data so that we have that list of students that we will be able to, and actually that's ongoing, that they're reaching out to and making some plans if they want to.

318
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:11,533
[SPEAKER_07]: meet the competency determination to change that status for them.

319
00:28:11,793 --> 00:28:13,354
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's work that's ongoing.

320
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:19,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And that concludes, that's the final slide.

321
00:28:19,555 --> 00:28:24,357
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there are any other further questions, I'm happy to help answer.

322
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:26,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Russo.

323
00:28:26,937 --> 00:28:27,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

324
00:28:28,238 --> 00:28:29,118
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that I don't

325
00:28:30,102 --> 00:28:40,167
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about a lot is that our students with significant disabilities that took the ALT MCAS, they never received a real diploma.

326
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not allowed.

327
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So they could perform all of the requirements we have.

328
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:52,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And because they use the ALT MCAS, they would get a certificate, but not a diploma.

329
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:57,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thrilled that the end of the MCAS requirement means that those students who have

330
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,321
[SPEAKER_04]: earned a diploma can get a diploma.

331
00:29:00,862 --> 00:29:09,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's important to recognize is that that change wasn't really part of the campaign to get rid of the MCAS.

332
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:16,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know some folks were campaigning in that, but for the most part, it wasn't the main push for it.

333
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:21,877
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's a super important feature of getting rid of this requirement.

334
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:38,609
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that it's, I agree, but I also want to make sure that in terms of our local requirement and the CD, so both of those things have to happen in order to get a diploma.

335
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:49,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And the competency determination means that you are able to pass the grade level content within those subject areas.

336
00:29:50,036 --> 00:30:03,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So any student that's able to meet grade level requirement for integrated math one and two, ELA ninth and 10th grade, and biology, then they've met that competency determination.

337
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:06,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're moving on to the local requirements.

338
00:30:07,443 --> 00:30:07,663
Thank you.

339
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:08,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

340
00:30:10,502 --> 00:30:11,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Galluzzi.

341
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:13,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you looking for a vote?

342
00:30:13,404 --> 00:30:13,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

343
00:30:13,764 --> 00:30:15,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion?

344
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:23,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because this would update the policy that is, I believe, IKF for Medford School Committee policy.

345
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:29,015
[SPEAKER_08]: So motion for approval to update the graduation competency policy.

346
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:33,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question about

347
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:46,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I was potentially going to motion to take 2025-03 out of order, because that either seems to be a sending this to the subcommittee or just updating the policy.

348
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:57,424
[SPEAKER_10]: So I see this is coming up on the agenda, but maybe Member Russo could clarify whether this is a policy update or a recommendation to send it to the subcommittee.

349
00:31:00,106 --> 00:31:01,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Member Russo?

350
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:07,576
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not unusual for superintendents to actually just recommend policy updates.

351
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:15,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, that hasn't been the practice in Medford for as long as I've been on, but I actually appreciate it greatly.

352
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,231
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I would say is that the policy

353
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:30,289
[SPEAKER_04]: know, it's a lovely formatted document, which is not what our policy service is particularly good at, and it lacks the policy required policy information at the end.

354
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:42,137
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, if the committee is okay with approving this as amended to include the policy information section at the end, then I'm fine with us not having more meetings about it.

355
00:31:43,358 --> 00:31:43,558
[SPEAKER_04]: So

356
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:50,894
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, I guess, an amendment to the recommendation to approve the policy, first reading?

357
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,415
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be just to update that language.

358
00:31:53,475 --> 00:32:09,159
[SPEAKER_07]: So the chart that's in here that shows the local graduation requirements and the MCAS, it would just be to update the local graduation requirements, which is really just a shift in how we're labeling the requirements and the competency determination.

359
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:32,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I kind of do want to just send this still to subcommittee just because like the current policy is, you know, refers to 2004 and 2005 and format wise, like I feel like the whole policy we currently have has to be thrown out and some of that stuff still has to be incorporated.

360
00:32:32,538 --> 00:32:37,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Like are the actual credit requirements that are in the policy, are those still correct?

361
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:38,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

362
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well that's good to know.

363
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:44,463
[SPEAKER_07]: They reflect the current need and practice right now.

364
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

365
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:55,908
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't really, I mean, based on that, I don't think we need a subcommittee, but I do think that like bringing this back in the proper policy format next time.

366
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:56,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

367
00:32:56,709 --> 00:33:04,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes sense to me, if that's okay with the members, but I would, well, it needs two readings anyways, so.

368
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:05,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

369
00:33:06,594 --> 00:33:09,535
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the next meeting, I can put it in that format.

370
00:33:10,095 --> 00:33:12,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can help you with that.

371
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:12,517
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

372
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:26,653
[SPEAKER_08]: So the final is a motion to hold subcommittee meeting to make.

373
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:29,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the second reading will be next meeting.

374
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:38,202
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so this motion for approval then by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Olopade.

375
00:33:40,003 --> 00:33:40,784
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

376
00:33:41,764 --> 00:33:41,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

377
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:43,025
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

378
00:33:44,346 --> 00:33:45,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

379
00:33:45,407 --> 00:33:45,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

380
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:46,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

381
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:47,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Good presentation, Dr. Galluzzi.

382
00:33:50,396 --> 00:33:57,186
[SPEAKER_08]: We have another report under superintendent reports.

383
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:06,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two would be summer fund sliding scale report by Dr. Cushing, assistant superintendent, and Noelle Velez, our director of finance.

384
00:34:09,027 --> 00:34:10,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the School Committee.

385
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:23,577
[SPEAKER_03]: As you may remember, two weeks ago, we had a motion for a summer fund budget and also to include the exploration of a sliding scale and rate.

386
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So tonight, I'm here to discuss that.

387
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:38,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, all the information contained in this report was is shipped from the previous report is shared at the bottom, just for context in case you need it.

388
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:48,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on the call with Noel and myself this evening is Mr. Petrelis, the director of the program, so he can jump in and add any he wished he could be in person.

389
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:49,848
[SPEAKER_03]: But

390
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,382
[SPEAKER_03]: more than fine having him virtual.

391
00:34:53,943 --> 00:34:56,385
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to get into it right away.

392
00:34:56,445 --> 00:34:59,327
[SPEAKER_03]: So annually, the summer fund begins with a zero budget.

393
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:16,663
[SPEAKER_03]: We're changing our practice on that beginning FY26 so that we can start having Medford's summer fund program be a self-funding, self-sustaining program as it has been, but so that the revenue is not just lumped in with all community schools.

394
00:35:17,063 --> 00:35:27,666
[SPEAKER_03]: that the program can build year over year, can really look at programming and those things and enhancing programming.

395
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:33,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Summer Fund provides nine hours of childcare per week, every day, nine hours.

396
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:39,629
[SPEAKER_03]: So currently the fee is $200 or $40 a day.

397
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,510
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes the per hour cost for childcare $4.44.

398
00:35:44,991 --> 00:35:54,960
[SPEAKER_03]: An increase to $250 makes the rate $5.55, and an increase to $2.75, which we are taking off the table, makes the hourly rate for $6.11.

399
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:04,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to provide the calculation simply because it was in there last time, but there seemed to be very little appetite for that at that point.

400
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Rate card requested is $50 to $250, but we will go through the rest of it.

401
00:36:11,595 --> 00:36:21,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So last year, we had 249 students who participated in multiple weeks of summer fun.

402
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:26,625
[SPEAKER_03]: Some students may have participated less than a full week at some point.

403
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:27,766
[SPEAKER_03]: That's 15 students.

404
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:35,171
[SPEAKER_03]: But 17 enrollees were there for all six weeks of the program last year.

405
00:36:38,373 --> 00:36:38,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Staffing.

406
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,570
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a total number of 25 staffers.

407
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:49,681
[SPEAKER_03]: That staffing level, and Mr. Petrallis, if you want to jump in on a point, that staffing level may have fluctuated.

408
00:36:50,595 --> 00:37:04,399
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, based on the number of enrollees, but the maximum number of staff that were employed was 25 counselors, an assistant director of two, and director of one.

409
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:07,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And counseling fluctuates week by week based on demand.

410
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you have the specific enrollments with the payroll as well.

411
00:37:15,562 --> 00:37:17,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as an example,

412
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:20,535
[SPEAKER_03]: First week, 71 students.

413
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:26,717
[SPEAKER_03]: The tuition that week is $160 because it goes up against the 4th of July week, that holiday we don't charge people for.

414
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:37,241
[SPEAKER_03]: I put in potential just because of some checks that may have not cleared, a small number of that.

415
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:39,702
[SPEAKER_03]: But so $11,360 potential and our payroll that week

416
00:37:43,623 --> 00:37:43,823
[SPEAKER_03]: was $11,288.67.

417
00:37:44,464 --> 00:37:51,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll see the breakdown of the numbers moving forward.

418
00:37:51,670 --> 00:38:00,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So our—and then potential revenue versus potential price points, based on FY24 numbers, you see the $200 per week

419
00:38:07,357 --> 00:38:10,278
[SPEAKER_03]: $250 per week and $275 per week.

420
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:12,699
[SPEAKER_03]: That is based on the numbers that we had last year.

421
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,281
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no enrollees right now because we have not opened registration.

422
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:19,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what that is.

423
00:38:19,882 --> 00:38:21,543
[SPEAKER_03]: The overall budget at a glance.

424
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

425
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:23,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just clear that.

426
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,763
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had, based on last year's numbers, we have an expected revenue this year of hopefully $131,960.

427
00:38:31,823 --> 00:38:35,444
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all based on the 200.

428
00:38:35,964 --> 00:38:37,525
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, this is for FY20.

429
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,926
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very confusing, even for myself at times.

430
00:38:40,646 --> 00:38:43,768
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at the summer of the FY's as they change.

431
00:38:43,828 --> 00:38:51,232
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the FY 25 summer fund budget last year, we brought in $131,960 with checks not clearing in the neighborhood of $1,200 for total summer fund revenue of $130,760.

432
00:39:01,702 --> 00:39:06,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Salaries were $96,280, approximate expenses of $8,000, so total summer fund expenses of $104,280.

433
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:07,603
[SPEAKER_03]: We then had $26,480 in revenue generated.

434
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,984
[SPEAKER_03]: This does not consider chargebacks that we do for other programs.

435
00:39:24,847 --> 00:39:27,649
[SPEAKER_03]: for electricity and water would be the two primary.

436
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:38,493
[SPEAKER_03]: The payrolls do include the overtimes for custodial cleanup at the end of the day.

437
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:47,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Potential revenue from other programs, I just want to say that we put this in here so that we're being transparent.

438
00:39:48,184 --> 00:39:52,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Our EL program has students attend after their programs finish.

439
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:55,510
[SPEAKER_03]: We do not currently charge those families.

440
00:39:57,092 --> 00:40:05,920
[SPEAKER_03]: We consider that to be a real statement of values to support vulnerable populations, as well as extended school year programs.

441
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,022
[SPEAKER_03]: and that option is there for families, all right, but we do not currently charge for that.

442
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:21,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to quantify that in some way, but I don't want anyone to think that we're seeking to get these funds.

443
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:33,330
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, before I move forward into the sliding scale, Mr. Petrellis or Noel, is there anything you'd like to add or anything that I've missed at this stage?

444
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:37,370
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I thought you'd done an excellent job.

445
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,171
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Anthony Petralas, by the way.

446
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:40,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I can do video today.

447
00:40:41,754 --> 00:40:44,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so everything's pretty accurate for what we see on there.

448
00:40:44,717 --> 00:40:53,345
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the biggest thing, and Dr. Cushing kind of just stressed it at the end, you know, the EL program, the extended school year program, just to give you an idea of how that works.

449
00:40:54,006 --> 00:40:57,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Extended school year, the EL program ends around 12 o'clock, and then

450
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:12,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago we had 20 kids it was a trial last year double the amount, just keep in mind, you know, obviously he said it best like we're not looking to charge by any means to a degree, but I also keep in mind if I have 135 140 kids that week.

451
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:18,418
[SPEAKER_01]: adding on 40 kids in the afternoon brings our numbers up dramatically.

452
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,159
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a huge undertaking for our program.

453
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:26,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanna put that out there on top of the other things that I'm responsible for our program.

454
00:41:27,121 --> 00:41:35,784
[SPEAKER_01]: I now become responsible for tutoring schedules with extended school year, getting kids to where they need to go, having a program that comes with us and attaches onto us.

455
00:41:35,824 --> 00:41:43,147
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a lot that kind that happens in the afternoon with our camp as well that I'm glad Dr. Cushion mentioned to everybody.

456
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

457
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:51,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, are you done with your presentation?

458
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:51,982
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

459
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:54,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sliding scale, but feel free to.

460
00:41:54,363 --> 00:41:55,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, OK.

461
00:41:55,544 --> 00:42:02,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I just read this earlier, so I knew what the final request was based on all of your research and pulling the data together.

462
00:42:02,348 --> 00:42:04,529
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't know what it was.

463
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, member Rousseau?

464
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:09,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Brantley?

465
00:42:09,752 --> 00:42:10,313
[SPEAKER_04]: This all says FY25.

466
00:42:10,333 --> 00:42:10,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Should you say FY24?

467
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it starts, the program starts.

468
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:19,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We have actual enrollment numbers.

469
00:42:21,196 --> 00:42:22,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't those?

470
00:42:23,097 --> 00:42:25,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Summer, yeah.

471
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It's FY20.

472
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:29,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these the numbers from last summer?

473
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:30,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

474
00:42:30,524 --> 00:42:31,104
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's FY24.

475
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:31,604
[SPEAKER_04]: No, 25.

476
00:42:32,785 --> 00:42:33,286
[SPEAKER_04]: That's FY25.

477
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:36,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I messed it up earlier, so I didn't confuse everyone.

478
00:42:36,368 --> 00:42:37,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I accept responsibility.

479
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:38,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It is FY25.

480
00:42:39,837 --> 00:42:41,098
[SPEAKER_04]: The prediction stuff is that much.

481
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I hate that so much.

482
00:42:42,439 --> 00:42:42,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

483
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:46,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, especially when it's just.

484
00:42:47,183 --> 00:42:49,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And the sliding scale also hurt my brain.

485
00:42:49,685 --> 00:42:52,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to lie.

486
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:54,349
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a point of clarification, though.

487
00:42:54,729 --> 00:42:56,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to just say that.

488
00:42:57,848 --> 00:43:07,735
[SPEAKER_07]: The director of EL Paltek, Sarah, also uses some of his title three funding to help support the staffing needs in the afternoon at summer fund.

489
00:43:07,775 --> 00:43:18,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe last summer it was one teacher and two assistants or aides, just so that there is an additional support added to the staffing.

490
00:43:19,983 --> 00:43:20,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

491
00:43:22,805 --> 00:43:23,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Brantley.

492
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that was just clarified my question.

493
00:43:26,267 --> 00:43:32,572
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's someone coming from the EL program to help Mr. Petralas every afternoon with these 40 extra children.

494
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:33,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

495
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:35,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we think that's enough people?

496
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:38,617
[SPEAKER_07]: It was three additional staff.

497
00:43:38,777 --> 00:43:48,506
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get more clarification on the amount of time they were there the entire time, but I know that it was one teacher and two aides.

498
00:43:48,966 --> 00:43:49,967
[SPEAKER_07]: One teacher and two aides.

499
00:43:51,474 --> 00:43:55,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes, in addition to the summer fund staffing.

500
00:43:56,317 --> 00:44:03,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So are they in charge of, Mr. Petrellis just mentioned, you know, tutoring and all of this stuff.

501
00:44:03,262 --> 00:44:04,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that they're responsible for?

502
00:44:04,603 --> 00:44:06,305
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like he's taking care of that part.

503
00:44:06,345 --> 00:44:14,610
[SPEAKER_03]: They provide the tutoring, but as you know, Mr. Petrellis helps ferry the kids to the rooms and where they need to be.

504
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the services, the academic services are in the morning.

505
00:44:19,253 --> 00:44:22,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the social piece is through summer fun in the afternoon.

506
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:30,619
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Teixeira has provided some additional staffing for the afternoon.

507
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:32,460
[SPEAKER_07]: And does that come out of his budget?

508
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:33,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Title III.

509
00:44:33,981 --> 00:44:34,061
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

510
00:44:34,121 --> 00:44:34,561
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

511
00:44:34,601 --> 00:44:34,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

512
00:44:37,002 --> 00:44:45,707
[SPEAKER_03]: So sliding scale, currently two programs within Medford Public Schools use a long existing

513
00:44:47,153 --> 00:44:50,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Sliding scale documents are on our website.

514
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:55,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And those discount levels based on income levels are 20%, 50%, 70%.

515
00:44:55,422 --> 00:44:58,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, before and after care and meet.

516
00:44:58,686 --> 00:44:58,926
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

517
00:45:07,105 --> 00:45:18,268
[SPEAKER_03]: We also took into consideration here, just so that you're aware, we are now a community eligibility provision district when it comes to food services.

518
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:29,652
[SPEAKER_03]: What used to drive a lot of financial decisions in district was if a child was considered a free meal, a reduced meal, or full pay.

519
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:41,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Community eligibility provision only considers, we can get the numbers for reduced, but they only consider free now for part of the to be eligible.

520
00:45:41,233 --> 00:45:47,437
[SPEAKER_03]: What the community eligibility provision does is it takes away the burden of parents having to fill out those forms every year.

521
00:45:48,421 --> 00:45:57,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also takes away the burden of the district to have to do a verification process of between 5% and 10% of those forms.

522
00:45:57,783 --> 00:46:09,666
[SPEAKER_03]: A random selection every year was supposed to be done of verifications of those forms to make sure, like, if Mr. Cushing filled it out and you did a random sampling to verify that.

523
00:46:10,326 --> 00:46:13,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, 38% of the Medford public schools

524
00:46:14,574 --> 00:46:18,196
[SPEAKER_03]: are considered free under the federal guidelines.

525
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So 62% are considered full pay.

526
00:46:21,577 --> 00:46:24,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I just use those numbers as an illustration.

527
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:43,307
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're to extrapolate those numbers, though, and say, well, 38% of students in summer fun, just using statistics, would be probably considered to be free, we'd have to make a decision as to what should the reduction be.

528
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:46,618
[SPEAKER_03]: using the 20%, 50%, 70% discount numbers, all right?

529
00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:49,920
[SPEAKER_03]: At 20%, at $250, a student would be asked to pay $200, all right?

530
00:46:51,661 --> 00:46:54,523
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would be asked to pay $200 at the 20% level.

531
00:46:54,563 --> 00:46:57,645
[SPEAKER_03]: At the 50% level, they'd be asked to pay $125.

532
00:46:57,725 --> 00:47:02,949
[SPEAKER_03]: At the 70% discount level, they'd be asked to pay $75.

533
00:47:12,827 --> 00:47:31,273
[SPEAKER_03]: The corresponding increase based on a sliding scale for a self-funding program would mean that we would need to basically charge $425 to offset the students at 70% reduction.

534
00:47:32,234 --> 00:47:35,195
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we would not be asking for income from everybody.

535
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:39,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would have to be $425 to make sure that we are covering our costs.

536
00:47:43,323 --> 00:47:47,388
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking with Mr. Petrales, that is an exorbitant sum.

537
00:47:48,849 --> 00:47:57,379
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're recommending is the $50 increase, which will allow the director and the assistant director

538
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:10,352
[SPEAKER_03]: to maintain affordability for Medford families and for us to make sure he offers scholarships now for us to make sure that that process is formalized more so than it already may be.

539
00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:24,721
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will also allow us to take a look at the hourly rate of salaries for our counselors and the overall stipend of directors, assistant directors and others, but then also to expand programming based on the numbers that were

540
00:48:25,288 --> 00:48:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: previously showed of revenue increasing to about $168,000.

541
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:50,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I worry with a sliding scale at this point, and not to say that I wouldn't recommend its consideration in the future, but I worry a sliding scale at this point that with right now summer funds starting with a $0 balance, that the financial burden would fall back on the district

542
00:48:52,242 --> 00:49:00,964
[SPEAKER_03]: or other community schools operations to try to make sure that we're able to fund the summer fund program for the six weeks.

543
00:49:01,684 --> 00:49:08,886
[SPEAKER_03]: If for some reason we misjudge, we over scholarship or do those types of situations.

544
00:49:12,867 --> 00:49:19,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Brantley, what was our rate for non-residents?

545
00:49:20,615 --> 00:49:21,196
[SPEAKER_06]: from last time?

546
00:49:22,397 --> 00:49:23,399
[SPEAKER_06]: We had it at $300.

547
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:29,727
[SPEAKER_06]: It says your non-resident rate is open for discussion, but we recommend $300 at this point.

548
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

549
00:49:30,127 --> 00:49:31,049
[SPEAKER_06]: So is that where we've been?

550
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:31,109
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

551
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:33,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't different.

552
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:33,792
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not different.

553
00:49:33,812 --> 00:49:33,852
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

554
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:34,593
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been the same.

555
00:49:35,835 --> 00:49:36,956
[SPEAKER_11]: The same as Nedford Residence?

556
00:49:37,177 --> 00:49:37,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

557
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:49,120
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could just add something, if I could add something, it wasn't until after COVID that the first time we've ever really gotten people outside of Medford very interested.

558
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,601
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mentioned last time, it's a really small number that we have in the course of a summer.

559
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:58,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that's been newer the last couple of years.

560
00:49:58,122 --> 00:50:04,843
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something we've had to kind of add and adjust because we've never really had kids from the outside of the city of Medford attend our camp before.

561
00:50:07,851 --> 00:50:15,875
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also think Mr. Petrala's office is a great program now with the addition of the school nutrition program offering meals and snacks.

562
00:50:17,296 --> 00:50:21,718
[SPEAKER_03]: It offers, I mean, many of you probably had your children go to it.

563
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:22,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great program.

564
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:25,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

565
00:50:28,081 --> 00:50:28,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

566
00:50:31,242 --> 00:50:31,823
[SPEAKER_11]: My math is,

567
00:50:32,923 --> 00:50:36,127
[SPEAKER_11]: not necessarily in agreement with your math here.

568
00:50:36,227 --> 00:50:53,327
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I looked at was if we accept the recommendation to go to $250, but we essentially also accept the 20% discount, which would essentially hold tuition at where it was last year.

569
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:59,895
[SPEAKER_11]: If I said 38% of our students would pay $200 a week and 62% of our students would pay $250 a week using the 684, I come up with a net potential revenue of $158,004.

570
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:03,357
[SPEAKER_11]: If I shift that to say half of our students pay $200 and half pay $250,

571
00:51:20,487 --> 00:51:22,348
[SPEAKER_11]: I come up with 153,900.

572
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:33,572
[SPEAKER_11]: So while I agree that the 70% discount is not affordable, I am not seeing how the 20% discount would not be viable.

573
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:40,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be clear, I did not do that extrapolation based on the

574
00:51:41,308 --> 00:51:42,469
[SPEAKER_03]: 38% and the 62%.

575
00:51:43,511 --> 00:52:03,832
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also, I think, a choice of the committee to say, right now, it rests with the Director of Community Schools and the Director of Summer Fund to, as parents or caregivers, bring need forward to respond to the need and provide at the individual level.

576
00:52:04,835 --> 00:52:16,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a parent, family, caregivers make the case that, you know, we really need an opportunity here for our child, but we can't afford it, the program works with them.

577
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:20,218
[SPEAKER_03]: But formalizing it is always.

578
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:21,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

579
00:52:21,139 --> 00:52:31,441
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I think my concern with that is there's, you know, lots of places in our storied history in Medford where people point to lack of transparency, lack of accountability,

580
00:52:32,155 --> 00:52:34,877
[SPEAKER_11]: cherry picking, favoritism, you name it, it comes.

581
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:43,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think from a programming perspective, I understand that Mr. Petrellis has the best of intentions.

582
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:48,124
[SPEAKER_11]: But if somebody were to bring an allegation forward, that sits with this committee.

583
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:54,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would really rather avoid putting Mr. Petrellis in a situation where he's having to defend trying to do the right thing.

584
00:52:55,328 --> 00:53:17,614
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think there need to be clear rules and I think there need to be clearly published tuitions that accompany those rules so that the rules of engagement for everybody are clear and parents who may or may not feel comfortable saying to Mr. Petrellis, hey, I need some help, like being willing and able to say, hey, I need some help requires an immense amount of

585
00:53:18,174 --> 00:53:31,104
[SPEAKER_11]: like understanding of the system versus like, here are the two programs, here are these possibilities for you so that people can do their homework and understand that if A, then B, right?

586
00:53:31,144 --> 00:53:35,888
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if I meet this, then I get X versus I have to go talk to somebody.

587
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:36,929
[SPEAKER_11]: What does that mean?

588
00:53:36,989 --> 00:53:37,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I making a case?

589
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I trying to convince him?

590
00:53:39,171 --> 00:53:40,292
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I need to buy him candy?

591
00:53:40,332 --> 00:53:43,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what is like, it sort of conjures up a lot of things that people

592
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,676
[SPEAKER_11]: get scared about and then frankly don't do.

593
00:53:46,696 --> 00:53:50,577
[SPEAKER_11]: It probably also contributes to the bounced checks that we see, right?

594
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:57,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Those could be families who simply couldn't afford to send their kid, but had no choice, right?

595
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,099
[SPEAKER_11]: Needed childcare.

596
00:53:58,659 --> 00:54:09,562
[SPEAKER_11]: So my math says, even if half of our students need support, our total tuition, either 153,000 or 158,000,

597
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:13,697
[SPEAKER_11]: would still be $20,000 more than last year.

598
00:54:17,205 --> 00:54:22,507
[SPEAKER_11]: And if payroll is only $96, there's a lot of room there to make those adjustments.

599
00:54:22,788 --> 00:54:43,977
[SPEAKER_11]: So unless I'm missing something, my motion would be to hold tuition at $200 for those who can demonstrate financial need, to increase tuition for everybody else to $250, and to increase tuition for non-residents to $300 a week.

600
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:48,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

601
00:54:49,846 --> 00:55:00,132
[SPEAKER_11]: So families who can demonstrate financial need through eligibility in what would otherwise be free and reduced lunch, right?

602
00:55:00,152 --> 00:55:01,733
[SPEAKER_11]: 200, which is the same as last year.

603
00:55:02,993 --> 00:55:06,735
[SPEAKER_11]: All other families will see an increase from 200 to 250.

604
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:12,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Out-of-town participants, we love you.

605
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:13,419
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

606
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,200
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a $300 a week tuition.

607
00:55:18,155 --> 00:55:19,316
[SPEAKER_03]: and still a very good deal.

608
00:55:20,516 --> 00:55:20,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

609
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:20,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

610
00:55:20,876 --> 00:55:23,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval seconded by Member Reinfeldt.

611
00:55:23,138 --> 00:55:26,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just go to Noel who wants to comment.

612
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:28,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everyone.

613
00:55:28,821 --> 00:55:30,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I couldn't be there in person.

614
00:55:32,063 --> 00:55:34,484
[SPEAKER_00]: But Jenny, thank you so much for what you said.

615
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:47,263
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can have a little bit of clarity and ask a question, what date would the school committee like for myself and Peter to use regarding a student eligibility when we run our direct certification?

616
00:55:47,283 --> 00:56:02,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we run those quarterly, so we can either use a December or an April 1st date to dictate how a family qualifies for these reduced prices, depending on enrollment and things of that nature, I guess.

617
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,811
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that would be my only thing I'd want to bring up.

618
00:56:04,931 --> 00:56:13,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going if with the recommendation to sliding scale so we have a so we have a date to use the proper report and notify families in a timely manner.

619
00:56:15,194 --> 00:56:24,557
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would amend my motion to say as established on April on the April 1st reports for financial eligibility.

620
00:56:25,878 --> 00:56:26,498
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

621
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:32,040
[SPEAKER_11]: From December to April so I want to use the what is sort of closest to

622
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:38,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll also add that.

623
00:56:42,575 --> 00:56:44,815
[SPEAKER_10]: So I agree with that and the reason behind it.

624
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:56,438
[SPEAKER_10]: My only question is whether that poses a, if we're looking to be opening registration in January, are we concerned that that would affect people's ability to commit or our ability to guarantee a spot?

625
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,541
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not worried about that.

626
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:17,252
[SPEAKER_03]: In all honesty, if we can still open in January, we can let people know about the opportunity for scholarshipping as well as, and look to support families.

627
00:57:17,552 --> 00:57:19,154
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see it as an issue.

628
00:57:19,634 --> 00:57:31,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that by going to January 1st is only gonna help families who, if you've ever been sitting online for these camps,

629
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:32,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Good Lord.

630
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:32,711
Yeah.

631
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:38,654
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we haven't opened registration yet.

632
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:43,957
[SPEAKER_08]: So once this is finalized, it seems like it's going to be supported tonight.

633
00:57:44,437 --> 00:57:49,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're going to advertise an open registration for when?

634
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,021
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as possible.

635
00:57:51,061 --> 00:57:51,181
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

636
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

637
00:57:54,442 --> 00:57:55,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeldt?

638
00:57:58,234 --> 00:58:02,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Will this opening of registration coincide with other summer programs?

639
00:58:02,616 --> 00:58:05,878
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if jumpstart dates are set or other.

640
00:58:06,018 --> 00:58:07,238
[SPEAKER_08]: This will be early, I think.

641
00:58:07,498 --> 00:58:07,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Earlier.

642
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:09,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Usually start thinking about it in May.

643
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:13,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Jumpstart dates are finalizing right now.

644
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:21,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we'll have that update within a week or two, definitely after the vacation period, if not by the end of the week.

645
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:24,467
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I would say is I don't know

646
00:58:26,198 --> 00:58:48,943
[SPEAKER_07]: As Director Valez said, the report is run quarterly, so I think we would also have some preliminary information that we could start to have some of the understanding as to where the families are that may need potential support, and then it would be able to be a finalized list as of April.

647
00:58:55,373 --> 00:58:56,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask a question?

648
00:58:57,255 --> 00:58:58,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Anthony on the Zoom.

649
00:58:58,516 --> 00:59:02,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, I'm not trying to be funny, but like, so what does that, I just don't know.

650
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:06,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so what does that mean for registration as far as like what we would have to do next?

651
00:59:06,525 --> 00:59:14,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more just like, I guess I got to hear it to kind of understand what the next steps would be if everything does get approved as far as figuring a lot of that out.

652
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,453
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'd update all the forms.

653
00:59:18,914 --> 00:59:24,584
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once everything's ready to go, release it to the public for registration.

654
00:59:25,346 --> 00:59:25,687
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

655
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:28,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Memogram.

656
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:45,556
[SPEAKER_11]: My my impression as well Anthony is that the communications team can support some of that work, because I think last time last two weeks ago whenever that was we also talked about.

657
00:59:45,576 --> 00:59:48,260
[SPEAKER_11]: That the idea of.

658
00:59:49,244 --> 00:59:53,027
[SPEAKER_11]: allowing all of this to happen in an online format so there's no checks.

659
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:59,412
[SPEAKER_11]: So all of that I think is going to require support from Will and the website team anyway.

660
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:04,396
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think putting all of that together as a package is something that you can

661
01:00:05,237 --> 01:00:07,778
[SPEAKER_11]: expect assistance with from central administration.

662
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:10,520
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been working just so everyone's full transparency.

663
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:15,342
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been working with our website vendor on two specific options.

664
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:19,584
[SPEAKER_03]: One that is available to us right now through the forms functionality of our website.

665
01:00:20,044 --> 01:00:25,707
[SPEAKER_03]: We already can accept payments and then we're also looking at an enrollment package

666
01:00:26,487 --> 01:00:28,007
[SPEAKER_03]: with our website as well.

667
01:00:28,347 --> 01:00:29,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably more to come on that in the future.

668
01:00:30,988 --> 01:00:41,570
[SPEAKER_03]: But just so that everyone's clear, we're trying to make it so that people don't have to stand in lines, people don't have to write checks, and that we can move into the 21st century.

669
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:47,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I do just also want to check through the wonders of modern technology and just wanted to verify.

670
01:00:47,611 --> 01:00:49,452
[SPEAKER_03]: We can run CEP anytime.

671
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:50,392
[SPEAKER_03]: We run it quarterly.

672
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:55,053
[SPEAKER_03]: We can run it anytime through our food service director as well.

673
01:00:57,538 --> 01:01:00,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will go with the April 1st date, because I think that's a good standard.

674
01:01:01,219 --> 01:01:03,359
[SPEAKER_03]: But as families come in, we are able to.

675
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:18,822
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there will be one, I think, not to take up any more airtime, but one of the great things about Summer Fund is the ability for a person to walk in.

676
01:01:19,882 --> 01:01:23,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think there will be some level of checks.

677
01:01:23,662 --> 01:01:27,003
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to see how a day of registration can work using the website.

678
01:01:27,663 --> 01:01:38,389
[SPEAKER_03]: However, this should reduce a significant level of stress that has been on Mr. Petrellis and hopefully making this an easier process.

679
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:39,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

680
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:39,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

681
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:45,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Once we advertise the right way, more people are bound to do it online and take that stress away.

682
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:55,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a motion on the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member Reinfeldt, as amended by Member Graham to make it the April 1st reports for eligibility date

683
01:01:57,368 --> 01:02:05,280
[SPEAKER_08]: $250 for those with financial need, $200 for those with financial need, $250 for everybody else, and if you're out of town, $300.

684
01:02:07,543 --> 01:02:09,306
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor, would you like a roll call?

685
01:02:10,698 --> 01:02:11,618
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we don't need a roll call.

686
01:02:11,738 --> 01:02:12,458
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

687
01:02:12,939 --> 01:02:13,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

688
01:02:13,299 --> 01:02:14,059
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

689
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:15,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

690
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:17,600
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mayor, can I just make one more comment?

691
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:29,862
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're going to change the salary stipends associated with the program, can you bring them to us so that we can have an understanding of what those are before they go into effect?

692
01:02:30,323 --> 01:02:34,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we are supposed to, I think we're supposed to be in approval of all of those things.

693
01:02:34,624 --> 01:02:39,325
[SPEAKER_03]: We would, I would not increase the salary or stipend without bringing it.

694
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:39,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.

695
01:02:39,765 --> 01:02:40,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

696
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:40,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

697
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:40,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

698
01:02:41,326 --> 01:02:42,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask one more question?

699
01:02:42,507 --> 01:02:44,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we just voted on it, but it was something I wanted to ask.

700
01:02:44,449 --> 01:02:46,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't want to be rude and interrupt anybody.

701
01:02:47,732 --> 01:02:53,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids who go to like Catholic school or private school outside of like that live in Medford, but go to a school in Medford like that.

702
01:02:53,578 --> 01:02:55,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just more asking opinion than anything else.

703
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,444
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be or would that be considered out of district as well?

704
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:03,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Wow, what an interesting wrinkle.

705
01:03:03,558 --> 01:03:05,938
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if they're residents, they're residents.

706
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:07,899
[SPEAKER_11]: They live in Medford.

707
01:03:07,979 --> 01:03:09,320
[SPEAKER_11]: They get the resident rate.

708
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:15,662
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd be super interested to know what the enrollment breakdown is, actually, which is a totally separate conversation for another time.

709
01:03:15,722 --> 01:03:19,083
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that would actually be really fascinating to learn about.

710
01:03:19,803 --> 01:03:24,065
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, Mr. Petrelis, maybe we could work to help recruit those kids back to our school district.

711
01:03:26,197 --> 01:03:26,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Try.

712
01:03:29,018 --> 01:03:30,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Petralas.

713
01:03:30,138 --> 01:03:31,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Director Velez.

714
01:03:31,479 --> 01:03:32,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

715
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:37,880
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no presentations of the public or continued business.

716
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:40,081
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have new business, however.

717
01:03:42,082 --> 01:03:43,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Offered by Member Rousseau, 2025-03.

718
01:03:43,662 --> 01:03:48,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to withdraw.

719
01:03:49,504 --> 01:03:50,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Second by Member Reinfeldt.

720
01:03:50,504 --> 01:03:51,464
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

721
01:03:51,484 --> 01:03:51,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

722
01:03:52,524 --> 01:03:53,225
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

723
01:03:53,445 --> 01:03:54,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion is withdrawn.

724
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:56,047
[SPEAKER_08]: offered by Member Graham, 2025-04.

725
01:03:56,308 --> 01:04:03,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it resolved that the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will develop a policy regarding district financial support for field trips.

726
01:04:03,731 --> 01:04:12,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it further resolved that the subcommittee will consider various types of field trips, including local and out-of-state, and outline criteria and perimeters clearly in the policy.

727
01:04:12,834 --> 01:04:19,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it also resolved that the subcommittee will confer with the district finance team to understand the potential cost impact of the policy.

728
01:04:20,477 --> 01:04:23,759
[SPEAKER_08]: The subcommittee will provide recommendations to the school committee no later than June 1st, 2025.

729
01:04:25,047 --> 01:04:27,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

730
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:28,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

731
01:04:29,174 --> 01:04:38,628
[SPEAKER_11]: We all, I think, received some emails from our color guard students who were talking about this upcoming trip to Pennsylvania and

732
01:04:40,514 --> 01:04:56,181
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that brought up for me was really around some of the one-off actions that we've taken as a committee over the last couple of years, albeit we had lesser money to rely on, which we no longer have.

733
01:04:56,821 --> 01:05:07,406
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have funded out-of-state field trips in certain instances based upon people coming to the podium and making a request and for us saying like,

734
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:16,802
[SPEAKER_11]: want students to have to go out and fundraise and miss trips in order to be able, you know, in order to be able to send some but not all students.

735
01:05:17,343 --> 01:05:27,455
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that money source drying up and with sort of a broad acknowledgement that there's a lot of field trips across the district and there's things like

736
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:36,392
[SPEAKER_11]: nationals for athletics and nationals for band and color guard and the ethics bowl and the robotics competition.

737
01:05:36,412 --> 01:05:37,652
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all these things.

738
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:44,896
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have not set a policy around what we think we should be doing.

739
01:05:45,177 --> 01:05:50,139
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think I would love to say for us to be able to say, we should pay for these things.

740
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:55,543
[SPEAKER_11]: But before we do that, we should think about what a policy might look like.

741
01:05:55,843 --> 01:05:56,003
[SPEAKER_11]: And

742
01:05:57,393 --> 01:06:02,275
[SPEAKER_11]: if we are going to bring forward a recommendation to pay for things, obviously that has to be budgeted and all the other things.

743
01:06:02,795 --> 01:06:08,238
[SPEAKER_11]: And we would need to understand like, what is the potential cost of such a policy?

744
01:06:08,378 --> 01:06:23,184
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is just simply to say that the rules and policy subcommittee will take this up and we'll draft a policy, think about the different kinds of field trips, work with the administration, and then also, you know, think about what the financial impact of whatever the recommendation is so that

745
01:06:25,423 --> 01:06:31,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Our classes, our advisors, our students, like they know what the rules of the road are and it isn't.

746
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:38,606
[SPEAKER_11]: sort of a squeaky wheel situation where we have some things being funded and not others.

747
01:06:38,706 --> 01:06:47,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, you know, we might have to take some baby steps to get to a reality where we don't have to ask students to fundraise and pay for things.

748
01:06:48,232 --> 01:06:52,975
[SPEAKER_11]: But the first step in baby steps is to like decide like where it is that you want to go.

749
01:06:53,055 --> 01:07:01,280
[SPEAKER_11]: So my hope is that the policy will help us establish where we want to go and then quantify like what, you know, what are the steps we might take to get there.

750
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,701
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just to move it to subcommittee.

751
01:07:04,422 --> 01:07:09,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion is for approval by Member Rousseau, seconded by Member Opade.

752
01:07:10,046 --> 01:07:10,787
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

753
01:07:10,807 --> 01:07:10,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

754
01:07:11,648 --> 01:07:12,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

755
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:14,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Paper will go into subcommittee.

756
01:07:16,244 --> 01:07:19,645
[SPEAKER_08]: for review and report out June 1st or before.

757
01:07:20,546 --> 01:07:30,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up, 2025-05, offered by Member Graham, be it resolved that the school committee makes the following changes to the membership of the Smetford Comprehensive High School Building Committee.

758
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:37,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Replace Dr. Edward Vincent, superintendent, with Dr. Suzanne Galluzzi, interim superintendent, as a voting member.

759
01:07:39,413 --> 01:07:45,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Replace Dr. Galluzzi's position as assistant superintendent as a voting member with Joan Bowen as a voting member.

760
01:07:46,573 --> 01:07:51,734
[SPEAKER_08]: and replace Tom Dalton as a non-voting member with Will Pippicelli as a non-voting member.

761
01:07:52,994 --> 01:07:57,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Remove, at the request of the committee member, Lawrence Brown, non-voting member.

762
01:07:57,595 --> 01:08:03,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Add an MTA member and Medford resident at the recommendation of Monica Raul to replace Lawrence Brown.

763
01:08:03,736 --> 01:08:10,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it further resolved that the committee is renewed through September 2026 or through the conclusion of the feasibility phase, whichever comes first.

764
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:13,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval by.

765
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just say something?

766
01:08:14,877 --> 01:08:16,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Member Graham.

767
01:08:16,419 --> 01:08:26,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to clarify the addition with, you know, when we added Mr. Brown to the committee, he told me he was like in this for a year.

768
01:08:26,492 --> 01:08:27,573
[SPEAKER_11]: He's newly retired.

769
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm envious of his retirement, but I guess he's ready to actually be retired.

770
01:08:34,023 --> 01:08:42,668
[SPEAKER_11]: So he sort of filled a spot that we talked about being really important, which is some additional voice from the MTA.

771
01:08:42,688 --> 01:08:51,353
[SPEAKER_11]: I did go back through and there weren't a lot of other potential candidates who are still in the district, et cetera.

772
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:55,595
[SPEAKER_11]: So this will allow us to go ask Ms.

773
01:08:55,615 --> 01:08:56,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Cabral

774
01:08:56,936 --> 01:09:02,721
[SPEAKER_11]: for a recommendation for somebody who is both an MTA member and a Medford resident.

775
01:09:02,781 --> 01:09:13,069
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not two people, it's just one, but just an acknowledgement that that's going to happen outside of the initial application process so that there is somebody sort of filling that space.

776
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:23,798
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once this is approved and Marta works to identify that person, we'll have to submit this form to the MSBA, which is why we all need to approve it tonight.

777
01:09:24,396 --> 01:09:24,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

778
01:09:24,776 --> 01:09:25,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for all that work.

779
01:09:26,797 --> 01:09:31,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Ntapa.

780
01:09:31,099 --> 01:09:31,779
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

781
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:32,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

782
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,320
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

783
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:34,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

784
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:46,185
[SPEAKER_08]: 2025-06, offered by Member Graham, be it resolved the Medford School Committee enters into the feasibility study agreement with the Massachusetts School Building Authority for the Medford High School Project.

785
01:09:46,486 --> 01:09:46,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

786
01:09:47,926 --> 01:09:48,186
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

787
01:09:48,526 --> 01:09:53,449
[SPEAKER_11]: So as you all know, we worked really hard to get all of our eligibility

788
01:09:54,932 --> 01:09:58,875
[SPEAKER_11]: information into the MSBA in early July.

789
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:11,286
[SPEAKER_11]: We worked with them really from July until December on what is called an enrollment certification, which is essentially the headcount of students that we will build a high school for.

790
01:10:11,306 --> 01:10:14,348
[SPEAKER_11]: So our current enrollment at the high school is about 1,200 students.

791
01:10:16,675 --> 01:10:28,588
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've worked really hard with them to demonstrate what we see here in Medford in collaboration with the mayor's office and our head of planning and development.

792
01:10:29,389 --> 01:10:32,492
[SPEAKER_11]: We've looked at permitted projects.

793
01:10:32,572 --> 01:10:33,173
[SPEAKER_11]: We've looked at

794
01:10:33,985 --> 01:10:43,735
[SPEAKER_11]: future potential projects we've had conversations, and we certified enrollment with MSBA at 1395 which is almost a 200 student increase which is great.

795
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:49,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a really sort of nice number and a place for us to grow into.

796
01:10:51,062 --> 01:10:57,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the next step in the process is for us to authorize the feasibility study agreement, which is a standard agreement.

797
01:10:58,049 --> 01:11:12,923
[SPEAKER_11]: It outlines and reports on things that have already happened, like the approval of $3 million, et cetera, and allows the district to enter into this next phase where we will hire an owner's project manager and a designer to do the feasibility study.

798
01:11:13,697 --> 01:11:21,539
[SPEAKER_11]: and this body needs to, is the approving body for the feasibility study funds to be expended in that way.

799
01:11:21,559 --> 01:11:23,699
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to sign that.

800
01:11:23,759 --> 01:11:27,080
[SPEAKER_11]: This group will need to sign off on that tonight.

801
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:32,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the board meeting for the MSBA is the week after February vacation.

802
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:34,242
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the 26th or 27th.

803
01:11:34,282 --> 01:11:40,743
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's my full expectation that the team will recommend to the board

804
01:11:41,143 --> 01:11:45,327
[SPEAKER_11]: that we be invited to the next phase, which is exciting.

805
01:11:45,808 --> 01:12:01,144
[SPEAKER_11]: The building committee is going to get working starting tomorrow to get ready for those next phase deliverables so we can very quickly get an RFP out the door and be ready to hire owner's project manager and really get to this next phase, which is where like all those meaty questions get answered, which is exciting.

806
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:06,441
[SPEAKER_11]: So this group needs to give us authorization to sign that agreement.

807
01:12:07,901 --> 01:12:11,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Howard, Attorney Greenspan, has a document he'll fill out.

808
01:12:11,102 --> 01:12:13,923
[SPEAKER_11]: The mayor has something that she will sign on behalf of the school committee.

809
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:17,023
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we will be off to the races for the board meeting.

810
01:12:18,023 --> 01:12:18,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful.

811
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:19,204
[SPEAKER_11]: That meeting's the 24th.

812
01:12:19,404 --> 01:12:20,204
[SPEAKER_11]: 24th, thank you.

813
01:12:20,244 --> 01:12:25,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve by Member Reinfeldt, seconded by Member Opade.

814
01:12:25,565 --> 01:12:26,345
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

815
01:12:26,485 --> 01:12:28,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you do a roll call just so that we can record it?

816
01:12:28,526 --> 01:12:29,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, roll call, please.

817
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:34,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Granley.

818
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:35,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

819
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:36,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Graham.

820
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:36,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

821
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:37,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Ntapa.

822
01:12:37,531 --> 01:12:37,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

823
01:12:37,832 --> 01:12:38,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Olopade.

824
01:12:38,612 --> 01:12:38,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

825
01:12:39,032 --> 01:12:39,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rheinfeld.

826
01:12:39,873 --> 01:12:40,053
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

827
01:12:40,173 --> 01:12:40,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Russo.

828
01:12:40,734 --> 01:12:40,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

829
01:12:41,014 --> 01:12:41,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longo.

830
01:12:41,874 --> 01:12:42,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

831
01:12:42,575 --> 01:12:43,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Submitted the affirmative.

832
01:12:43,436 --> 01:12:44,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero the negative.

833
01:12:44,216 --> 01:12:44,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Paper passes.

834
01:12:45,217 --> 01:12:45,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

835
01:12:45,777 --> 01:12:46,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

836
01:12:47,558 --> 01:12:49,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Do not have any reports requested.

837
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:51,121
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a few condolences.

838
01:12:52,642 --> 01:12:58,866
[SPEAKER_08]: The members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincere condolences to the family of Anne Louise Riley Ellis.

839
01:12:59,307 --> 01:13:03,570
