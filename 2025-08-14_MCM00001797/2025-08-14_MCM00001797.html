    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=111.72">Great.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=112.374">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=112.954">Well,</a>  thank you, Madam Mayor and Madam Chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=116.837">My</a>  name is David Brosnan, and I am a board member and an officer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=122.761">I'm</a>  the treasurer of Metro Community Housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=125.462">Also</a>  joining us is our president, Henry Grappa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=128.765">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=132.187">He</a>  is remote, as you can see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=139.644">The</a>  purpose of our presentation tonight is to explore the possibility of getting a few more dollars to finish up our project at 703 Fellsway West. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=156.767">Our</a>  project is very close to final completion, and we are <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=165.642">frankly,</a>  still getting the bills in from, on both the hard costs, the construction side and the soft costs side, the consultants and the various design professionals that we've had to engage to get it going. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=185.377">I</a>  hope not to take up very much of your time tonight. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=189.5">I</a>  can give you a little bit of the history of the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=193.422">This</a>  project was first thought up back in, I think, 2018 or 2019. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=203.828">Our</a>  original presentations to the CPC, to the North Suburban Home Consortium, and to the bank, which was then Century Bank. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=218.376">It's</a>  now Eastern Bank, were made in <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=224.006">2019.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=224.867">Funding</a>  was approved in 2022. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=230.131">Construction</a>  started midway through the year in 2023. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=238.977">And</a>  the construction end has run into, quite frankly, a few snags, a few overruns. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=249.946">And</a>  we've been working very hard <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=252.231">with</a>  the contractor to try to keep costs under control. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=256.172">At</a>  one point, our project was kind of, we decided that we would, in understanding with the contractor, we worked to, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=276.513">set</a>  aside some of our gripes and some of their gripes and try to get the project done and push toward completion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=287.018">We</a>  are now in the punch list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=296.528">and</a>  just make sure it all meets with the specifications and the drawings that have been made. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=305.534">We</a>  did have to make some tough choices along the way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=309.037">We</a>  had to kind of to control costs because costs have risen, frankly, during the time that the project has been going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=319.624">So</a>  this morning I ran some of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=326.843">a</a>  computer here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=330.345">I</a>  keep getting tongue tied on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=332.447">The</a>  consumer product, consumer, what are they? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=342.313">Calculator.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=343.974">And</a>  we looked at it at three milestones. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=349.157">So</a>  since we signed the contract with the contractor, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=355.485">So</a>  part of this is inflation driven. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=362.568">So</a>  project driven, and we can talk about the project stuff later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=366.569">But</a>  since we signed the contract in 2023, we've had 5.9% inflation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=375.472">Since</a>  we got our funding approved, 5%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=383.646">Inflation.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=386.728">And</a>  since we wrote the pro forma that has been circulated to everyone, we've had 20.9%. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=394.332">Requesting</a>  will be roughly 12% or about $200,000 if it's agreeable to the board. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=401.937">We</a>  are certainly willing to talk about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=416.353">uh</a>  from our point of view to see that we could pay the deal with the change orders that have come through and also recoup some of the soft costs that have been on so we pay an architect <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=442.208">uh,</a>  to be our site eyes and ears and to look at things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=446.452">And</a>  he, um, he actually assembled the punch lists, um, that you've seen. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=451.597">Hey,</a>  you know, he's indispensable to the project and, uh, he came in at a very critical time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=461.766">Um,</a>  he, he, he's a terrific, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=465.5">has</a>  a terrific eye for things and has given us excellent service and advice, but he sends a bill every month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=473.525">And</a>  as long as the project goes on, he'll be doing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=477.507">So</a>  that's one example of a project driven cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=483.631">Other</a>  examples are the fact that certain things that were specified on the drawings <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=493.909">by</a>  the designing architect, Don Valenti, are no longer made or are no longer available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=503.333">We</a>  look for something of equivalent quality and value. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=509.676">And</a>  oftentimes, we are finding that it's costing more to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=517.019">We</a>  have had to <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=520.432">We've</a>  had to make some decisions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=522.152">And</a>  one example of that is the flooring. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=526.473">We</a>  have vinyl sheet flooring in every room of the building except for the bathrooms, which have ceramic tile, and maybe the front lobby, which is going to have a heavy duty carpet that will clean your shoes as you walk in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=551.341">And</a>  there have been, I'll be very honest, it seems to have been, this one, a tough project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=562.764">The</a>  site was very tough. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=566.245">We</a>  thought, initially, the excavation went very well, up where we were expecting all the ledge to be, at the back of the lot. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=577.46">But</a>  where we ran into the real excavation fight, where we were running into ledge all the time, was kind of down toward the sidewalk. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=586.823">And</a>  when we were trying to get utility lines through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=590.284">And</a>  that turned into just a lot of stops and starts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=598.547">We</a>  can discuss any of this, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=606.1">We</a>  think that we've been prudent in the things that we've done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=612.144">One</a>  other thing that when our last winter early this year, when things were stalled, we did sit down with the contractor and her attorney and with Henry, we negotiated a memorandum of understanding that I've included <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=635.612">with</a>  the contract, to make sure that we had an enforceable target date and some consequence if the target date wasn't met. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=648.16">Now,</a>  in a perfect world, we'd be collecting money every day. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=653.423">Unfortunately,</a>  we can't hold our contractor responsible for National Grid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=660.908">And</a>  National Grid is the one that we've still got here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=667.775">National</a>  Grid has not hooked up to power. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=671.819">Their</a>  legal team told us earlier this year that they've changed the way that they want to bring power onto our site. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=683.742">the</a>  house next door that we own, the power came into the back of the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=688.884">National</a>  Grid is now planning, and we expect it to happen within days of this meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=699.029">If</a>  everything we're told comes out right, and this is in fact what will be the case, they plan to put a new utility pole <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=712.84">right</a>  on the corner or next to our lot out on the Pell's Way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=717.721">They</a>  have to arrange a state police detail to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=721.742">And</a>  they're going to connect our power to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=725.123">That</a>  alone caused the change order because the electrician now had to bring the electric service connection out back to the house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=738.867">And</a>  I can regale you with <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=743.685">But</a>  we think that this project will get done very quickly after the power is hooked up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=762.594">We</a>  wish to invite everyone to our grand opening. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=771.942">And</a>  we would respectfully ask you to consider a grant of $200,000 or up to $200,000 on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=778.764">And</a>  we would be happy to entertain any comments or questions that you have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=783.104">We</a>  understand <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=800.455">You're</a>  not going to decide this tonight, but we're certainly happy to provide any information you need. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=810.1">We've</a>  downloaded the application, and it was just my own schedule prevented me from getting it complete in time for the... Our recollection is three units, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=829.832">Do</a>  you restrict it in perpetuity? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=831.734">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=834.356">So</a>  we have just about all of our funding, the bank requires that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=844.724">And</a>  so we have one single bedroom unit and we have two three bedroom units. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=852.711">We</a>  believed at the time of design <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=855.816">that</a>  the three bedroom unit was a lot better for families. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=859.339">They</a>  might have a boy or girl that they could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=869.726">And</a>  we believe we're going to find a lot of applicants for this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=877.211">We've</a>  engaged an affordable lottery agent <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=885.55">fair</a>  marketing agent to assist us in this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=890.033">And,</a>  um... And we saw, through the chair, we saw any other table grants that have gone back to home or... Well, from what we're getting from Malden on that, um, we've... <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=913.008">We</a>  don't think there's any home money left, actually.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=921.233">Well,</a>  we were in the process of doing that and we were encouraged maybe to make this stop first and to see because given the timeframes involved and given the <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=937.794">the</a>  fact that we had already received grants from the CPC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=943.976">And</a>  given their cycle of funding, we were, Catherine and Teresa encouraged us to explore this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=956.882">And</a>  so this is our stop. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=963.075">As</a>  far as have we, have we looked at other things? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=966.66">Well,</a>  I can tell you, um, metric community housing has, has, um, if you look at the developers fee, well, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=982.227">We've</a>  spent a lot of that money trying to get the project done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=986.108">So</a>  we're not gonna walk away with a lot of money in our treasury to spend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=992.849">Our</a>  priority is to get this done, get tenants in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1001.811">And</a>  I would not presume to do so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1005.232">The</a>  contractor on the last five requisitions has not marked up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1011.237">overhead</a>  and profit on the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1015.5">So</a>  that is a significant amount of money between the two of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1023.226">And</a>  again, we think, you know, just judging at the bills that are coming in and the bills that we already have pending, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1039.429">And</a>  the amount we've spent on soft costs and on construction, the amount I've mentioned would just hit the sweet spot and put us in the right place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1055.801">And</a>  we can, there are any other questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1061.305">I</a>  guess.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1061.725">There's</a>  a couple of questions here.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1063.927">I</a>  have some as well, but I'm gonna hold off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1065.968">Penny?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1066.409">Yeah,</a>  thanks to the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1068.272">kind</a>  of to your last point, I was wondering, you said the ask is a little conservative, so I just, I didn't all admit I got these documents right before, so if it's in them, I apologize, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1077.375">Well,</a>  they were just created right before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1081.777">But</a>  will this finish the project? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1083.478">Is</a>  this what you need? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1085.339">Do</a>  you need, is this the real amount that you will need to complete this project and get all the finished?</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1095.527">Books</a>  have not been closed on the project and won't be until every sub. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1103.449">And</a>  we also have a period of negotiation with the general contractor for what is covered by an allowance, what is a legitimate change order, and what is not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1117.293">We</a>  have our opinions about those things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1120.654">We</a>  are not going to pay the contractor for doing rework. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1126.082">of</a>  things that were found to be unacceptable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1131.184">And</a>  we are not going to pay for things we've already paid for once. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1136.547">So</a>  all of those things have to be scrutinized. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1141.009">And</a>  we are going to look at those very hard and try to get that number down as low as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1152.194">We</a>  know that there's no bottomless pit <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1155.603">of</a>  money, and no one's more aware of it than we are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1159.905">But</a>  the project is at like 98% right now of completion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1165.948">So</a>  if you, and we invite you to do so, if you want to come to the site, give me a call and I'll walk you through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1174.632">There</a>  are three apartments there with appliances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1179.812">and</a>  I think locks on the doors as of today, and running water. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1188.254">And</a>  the only thing we don't have is working electricity off the street yet, where we're kind of patching the power through from our adjacent property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1198.676">But,</a>  Henry, I don't know if you have, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1208.594">The</a>  email that we got from the contract showing some pictures of some of the punch list items that were being completed in the last couple of days.</p>

    <p>[Henry Rappa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1224.666">I</a>  can certainly try to pull that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1226.308">I</a>  want to jump in with a couple of quick things too before we get into the question period. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1232.012">These</a>  are going to be local action units. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1235.87">I'm</a>  told by our lottery agent that they have already approved the marketing plan.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1246.475">And-</a>  So DHCD has approved that, is that- Yes, correct. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1252.658">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Henry Rappa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1253.339">And</a>  one of the things I wanted to point out to the trustees is that we really kept a lid on all <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1263.398">Costs</a>  David and myself have given a lot countless hours of free time to the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1273.309">I</a>  have done all the legal work. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1276.536">with</a>  the contractor's attorney without cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1281.8">David</a>  has been over there practically every week at meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1286.904">We've</a>  really kept a tight grip on it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1289.847">Our</a>  executive director retired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1292.149">We</a>  did not fill that petition because we've used whatever free cash we've had to pour back into the project. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1301.076">I</a>  would shudder to think if we actually, David's experience in construction, I am as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1308.521">Because</a>  of that, we've been able really to keep things on track. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1313.504">We've</a>  picked up problems before they could become more of an issue. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1318.727">When</a>  the zip board was installed in the spring of 2024, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1325.973">The</a>  zip board sent by the supplier had mold on it and it was installed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1331.781">The</a>  contractor had to remove it and reinstall it at her expense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1338.21">David</a>  and I frequently were at this project trying to make sure things stayed <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1343.016">on</a>  the rails. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1344.217">So,</a>  when we're coming in asking for more money, I do want all of you to understand that it wasn't as any result of not budgeting properly or not watching things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1356.748">We</a>  made some good cuts when we could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1359.25">The</a>  site was definitely challenging with the utilities. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1362.353">And</a>  just the general core inflation, as David said, this budget was set <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1367.796">in</a>  2022 with home. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1371.74">And</a>  the real problem we're seeing now, I know there was a question about did we go back to home. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1377.61">I</a>  shudder to think what's going to happen in the future with federal funding of projects like this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1383.631">It</a>  seems to me like that's an adage of the past. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1387.172">You</a>  know, we try as a community housing organization to do something that some of the other affordable housing developers are not doing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1397.113">We</a>  try to have units that will accommodate a family, that will allow for families to be part of the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1406.553">And</a>  a key point that David brought up is we're not even getting a semblance of the developer's fee that was anticipated in the beginning. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1415.858">And</a>  that developer's fee doesn't line anyone's pockets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1418.159">A</a>  developer's fee is what helps our organizational bottom line. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1423.321">But</a>  again, that's where David and I running the organization without the executive director, we've been able to save that money for a period of eight months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1432.386">It's</a>  helped us get through this period of <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1435.367">of</a>  expenses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1436.248">And</a>  really, you know, to the contractors, I give her credit too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1442.152">I</a>  mean, she is not making anything on this project because the cost overruns had been, just the inflationary cost overruns had been a real problem for everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1452.5">I</a>  think <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1455.354">You</a>  know, doing it on a tight budget is a good thing, but this has been really challenging for us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1460.779">And</a>  that's why we're coming back and asking for a bit more just to close out the books. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1467.424">Like</a>  David had said, we have a consultant who's been invaluable in making sure that the project went smoothly, that there were not errors, and he'd been on site checking to see that <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1481.608">things</a>  have been done properly, so we can be proud of the project is built. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1491.031">So</a>  I just wanted to jump in with those points. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1493.371">And</a>  I know you have questions, and David is happy to answer them, and I am as well.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1497.912">And</a>  I'd just add to what Henry said, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1504.737">I'm</a>  not sure, well, this is an affordable housing trust, so you must be familiar with the term what percent of AMI area mean income, median income. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1517.162">These</a>  units are intended for 60% AMI, which is far lower in amount of income than most developers <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1530.172">who</a>  throw a few affordable units into a much larger development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1537.878">They</a>  tend to be up around 75, 80%, if not more of AMI. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1544.002">So</a>  we think we're doing a service and we think we've held the line as far as we possibly could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1555.43">I</a>  don't think we'd be responsible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1560.512">if</a>  we didn't try to make sure that the books were balanced and try to close it out as efficiently as possible.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1572.862">Did</a>  you have any other questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1574.303">Any,</a>  Caleb, do you have any questions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1576.245">No,</a>  I think that's it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1578.567">I</a>  do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1579.768">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1580.548">You</a>  answered my question about AMIs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1582.49">So</a>  I'm glad to hear 60% AMI. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1585.609">Glad</a>  to hear the tenant selection plan has been approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1588.551">And</a>  it sounds like HLC has approved the tenant selection plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1591.873">Is</a>  that what I heard? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1593.473">HLC</a>  Housing and Community Living Development.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1596.215">State</a>  agency, DHC.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1600.618">Last</a>  known as DHCD.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1603.419">They</a>  change those letters all the time.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1605.56">I'm</a>  sorry, let me rephrase that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1607.561">Who</a>  approved the tenant selection plan?</p>

    <p>[Henry Rappa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1612.16">My</a>  understanding is I still call him DHC CD as well, but it's been approved by the appropriate successor agency to that what we use services for our housing lottery agent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1628.099">I.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1630.261">Explain</a>  to them in depth, and I believe Catherine Buckingham has been fabulous. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1635.543">She's</a>  helped a lot with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1637.504">We've</a>  got the local action unit application. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1640.985">Everything</a>  the affordable housing restriction, which was recorded at the time of her financing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1647.088">D.</a>  H. well, the new agency is reviewing that I've worked with them before on a few occasions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1655.351">To</a>  put things together in quick order, so it's my understanding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1660.895">We</a>  should be ready to start advertising before leasing these units out because obviously for us, we want 2 things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1669.0">We</a>  want to get people into this lovely new building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1672.642">We</a>  also want to be able to get some of the rental stream. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1675.964">They</a>  help carry cover our carrying costs. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1678.466">I</a>  mean, obvious we're still paying insurance and taxes and utilities on this structure. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1684.049">We</a>  want to get people in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1686.091">And</a>  the good news is, you know, I'm told we're moving along at a very quick pace on that, which is something that I'm relieved at, because I really need this building occupied by, say, late October.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1703.208">I</a>  think that would be ideal. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1706.811">The</a>  question was asked about home money, and I heard that it sounds like Malden says there's no more home money. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1713.476">Is</a>  that because you've reached the maximum allowed for maximum subsidy per unit for this development, or is there just no more home money available?</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1726.347">We</a>  have not checked on what the current maximum subsidy per unit <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1734.025">is</a>  right now.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1735.306">It</a>  goes back to the date of the poll memo.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1738.607">Then</a>  we did, we did max that out.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1741.389">That's</a>  why there's no more funding available.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1744.49">But</a>  Paul Goldstein this morning told me, and I was, I was kind of asking, you know, you know, to include people when we, when we finally open the place. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1756.756">I</a>  asked, is there anyone in the Boston POT office? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1759.437">He</a>  says, I don't think there's anyone left. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1762.045">the</a>  bus there is there is there's at least one person i don't know she's visiting there but so that was kind of surprising to me because i i think they do they do a lot uh and uh i i'm not well i will hope yeah that's funny opinion</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1783.559">No,</a>  we'll, we'll keep this here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1785.38">I've</a>  got a couple more questions and I apologize, but I'm looking at everything and you say you've got an estimate of $200,000 to get this through the finish line and everybody don't get me wrong. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1795.366">Like</a>  I, everybody, we're here to create housing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1798.027">We're</a>  here to put in people in affordable housing, but looking at it and looking at the numbers and you know, your contract. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1805.642">here</a>  that you shared with us is the same amount of your MOU. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1812.729">And</a>  what I read through the MOU was it was stopped because of getting, because of price increases, right?</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1821.857">Well,</a>  I would say we got to a point with, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1831.75">The</a>  contractor was not moving expeditiously. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1834.892">The</a>  project was behind schedule significantly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1838.235">There</a>  were some disagreements with the contractor about what we would pay for and what we would not pay for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1848.844">And</a>  there was, at the time, some discussion about, you know, is this worth finishing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1861.5">And</a>  we came to the decision that we did not want to leave a half-finished building there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1870.707">We</a>  did not see that getting, trying to go after the contractor's bond or firing the contractor and trying to bring a new contractor in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1885.178">The</a>  advice we got after, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1888.825">talking</a>  to people we know and and and what was that we would double the cost of what was remaining you know if we had spent half the money at that point we'd need much much more than we're talking about we're probably talking now about <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1910.921">you</a>  know, probably seven or eight hundred thousand dollars that we'd have to add to our budget because of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1917.386">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1920.049">Because</a>  the contractors would simply mark up the price because they were walking into a bad situation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1929.897">Had</a>  we tried to approach it from a point of putting a claim against the bonds? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1937.203">Well,</a>  our <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1940.021">What</a>  we found out there was that the first thing the insurance company, who writes the bond, would do would be to try to mediate the whole situation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1949.99">And</a>  we said, well, we don't need to go through all that exercise. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1954.033">We</a>  can sit down with the contractor ourselves, and we can work it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1960.739">So</a>  to get this project up and going again, and to push it toward completion, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1966.855">Metric</a>  community housing had to set aside a few of our gripes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1971.799">And</a>  the contractor had to set aside a few of their things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1976.002">What</a>  greatly encouraged us to move on this path was that, as you see in the MOU, the contractor agreed that other than certain defined areas, that the bulk of the project would be delivered <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=1997.428">under</a>  the original contract amount. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2000.29">And</a>  that is why we stayed with that contractor and pursued the memo of understanding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2007.396">And</a>  even at that, here I am today.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2013.901">I</a>  appreciate you walking me through one more time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2018.405">National</a>  grid, it sounds, so through this, if they didn't meet their target date, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2024.513">after,</a>  I think it was June 16th, a $500 fine, I'm going to call it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2028.354">I</a>  believe it's $250 a day.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2029.815">I'm</a>  not sure it's $500. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2030.495">Yep,</a>  $500. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2030.675">Results</a>  in liquidated damages of $500 for each calendar day after June 16th is what I see here.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2049.523">You're</a>  saying that part of it, you can't charge them for something that they have no control over. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2055.047">That's</a>  national grade. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2057.028">So</a>  my question is how much of this $200,000 is actually associated with, let me rephrase that question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2067.755">How</a>  much of these punch lists can get done? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2070.797">And</a>  does any of these punch list items associate with this additional $200,000?</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2082.877">I</a>  don't think it's broken out in quite that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2086.278">I</a>  think we're seeing, and those that are piling up, I don't think it's a matter of them get, I mean, the punch list items will be done <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2103.077">imminently</a>  almost irrespective of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2106.818">It</a>  is not, you can see there is a section of the punch list that's national grid related things.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2115.181">But</a>  what I guess, I guess my, I want to be clear in my question, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2120.603">Because</a>  I understand that this project has been going on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2123.424">I</a>  understand that it's been speed bumps and there are hiccups going on with the development, inflation going on with the development. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2130.566">There's,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2131.413">If</a>  I did my math correctly, it is over $460,000 per unit of subsidy that went into the property, what is going into the property. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2143.997">I'm</a>  looking at this and it says that if it's not completed by the date of, I think it is June, completion date of June 10th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2155.461">And</a>  I understand like there are some things that are beyond the control, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2158.765">but</a>  when you think about completion date, according to the MOU says that includes the, and the punch, there's quite some, there's still a lot of items here that are not necessarily related to the national grid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2174.908">So</a>  I'm just thinking about dollars. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2177.888">I'm</a>  just thinking about, you know, you all are taking, just taking a big hunk of it already with your developers fee, developers sounds like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2188.502">There</a>  may be some sort of understanding with the contractor that you're not going to get hit with other other bills like it doesn't sound like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2197.078">It</a>  sounds like they're they're not other bills that they're they're. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2202.082">Labor</a>  and stuff, they're staying within costs, right?</p>

    <p>[Henry Rappa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2205.603">With</a>  the exception of change orders that may have been necessitated by different circumstances. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2213.764">We</a>  definitely had more issues with the utilities in the lower part. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2218.685">I</a>  mean, that was, they had a really hard time getting the water line in. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2223.246">But</a>  basically what she agreed to do was hold the line on her costs and do what she was supposed to do at that charge. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2232.728">We</a>  run into the issue, as David was saying, we have other costs, additional architectural costs, additional consulting costs, things that have increased by inflation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2244.354">We</a>  could make the change on the hardwood floor to the vinyl plank without in any way jeopardizing the integrity of the product. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2251.777">But</a>  there are some issues that we just can't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2254.358">When</a>  I looked at it, and I looked at it from the substantial completion, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2259.22">Idea,</a>  she she does believe me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2261.782">I've</a>  held her feet to the fire in that of her attorney She you know, we were up against home being right getting our last disbursement by a point in september or we weren't going to get it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2273.611">We</a>  I held Both her attorney and her feet to the fire Really with putting some fear into them of what was going to happen <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2284.768">This</a>  project didn't get done the substantial completion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2287.85">They</a>  did a good job of getting close to that June 16th date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2291.912">It</a>  should never have been that long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2293.433">I'm</a>  the 1st to say it drove me crazy and took whatever here I had and made the rest fall out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2300.297">But</a>  the reality is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2302.498">A</a>  lot of the things now, like testing the fire department system, and the electrical services, and all of those things are really related to national grid holding us up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2313.241">And</a>  another example that David had brought up was the moving of the electrical panel, because on the plans, it was supposed to be in the back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2321.503">They</a>  were originally supposed to put a pole in the back. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2324.544">And</a>  then midstream, or not even midstream, at the end of the stream, they decided they were going to change the location of the pole. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2330.923">Which,</a>  you know, created the cost. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2334.204">And</a>  we're not the type of developer that can pass that on to the people who are renting or the purchasers of the units. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2342.588">It</a>  comes out of our pocket. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2344.209">Thankfully,</a>  you know, we had the developer fee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2346.95">Well,</a>  we don't have the developer fee, but that acted as a cushion for us that we could. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2351.472">survive</a>  and pay a few things out of that and you know, we didn't have to retain legal counsel to deal with the contractor's attorney and David had done a lot of assistance when they were questions that came up about you know Structural things and water lines and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2367.623">He's</a>  able to give it expertise, you know, I'm always Cautious and we have to come back and ask for money because I never want I take David and I take a lot of this <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2380.185">We</a>  would never want anyone to think we didn't do a good job with our original target and that we're off. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2387.093">I</a>  think between the inflation and between a few of the things that were really unforeseen, like the national grid, I don't know why they were so unreasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2395.983">I</a>  don't know why they forced us to do it in the front. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2398.646">I</a>  don't know why they've taken so long. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2400.988">They</a>  also tied my hands because you make a good point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2403.749">If</a>  I had all the electrical installed in there, then I can go to the contractor in good faith and say you missed a target date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2410.452">But</a>  the first if I go after her, the first word her experienced attorney is going to say to me is you haven't delivered me electrical power yet.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2420.204">But</a>  Henry, I hear what you're saying and I can appreciate the national grid and the head of it that comes along with it because I experienced it in my day job as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2433.933">However,</a>  I'm looking at the thing and I'm just trying to wrap my head around it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2438.696">It</a>  sounds like you guys have done a really good job at trying to mediate with your contractor, but I'm looking at this and it says that for the completion, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2448.852">In</a>  the completion of all punch list items identified by the consultant and taking off your electric, taking off anything that goes on with the national grid, there are items on this punch list that was provided today that are not associated with the national grid, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2470.787">So</a>  I understand that there's some things that are beyond your contractor's control, national grid beyond the contractor's control, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2477.942">but</a>  there are things on this punch list as dated. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2482.605">I</a>  guess it was dated 730, which is past June 16th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2490.25">As</a>  of today, there are only a few highlighted items. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2493.852">Is</a>  there any movement? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2496.994">Is</a>  there any more negotiation that you can do with the contractor? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2502.818">I</a>  hear that you guys have been through the wringer already, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2508.597">just</a>  trying to think about dollars just trying to think about you know what ifs you know you gotta have a plan b what where's where's your plan b and going and having something where you have a document which i heard was enforceable for everything for everything except for things that are beyond their control the item number one uh <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2533.565">procure</a>  and install hydraulic radiation units and stairwells, wash or dryer room. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2540.891">Does</a>  that have to do with national grid? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2544.373">Install</a>  panel board covers on apartments, sub-panel locations, intercoms, HM doors, install glass lights at HM doors and basement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2559.365">Like</a>  some of these things are not necessarily associated with <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2563.801">national</a>  grid items.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2566.463">True,</a>  some of them are not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2571.646">What</a>  can be a little bit of a complicating factor with deadlines is that when there are approved change orders, change orders generally represent two things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2586.116">First,</a>  a change in the contract amount. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2590.379">And</a>  second, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2592.08">a</a>  change in the deadline. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2594.522">Oftentimes,</a>  a change order will say, this will add so many days to the deadline.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2600.825">But</a>  you didn't supply that.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2602.546">I</a>  did not, because we have not been formally given all the change orders on the project just yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2615.655">And</a>  this is one of the things that we're trying to head off here.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2622.348">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2625.711">Like</a>  I said, I'm just wrapping around the information that you provided, wrapping around the information that you shared with us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2632.356">And,</a>  you know, things in writing, I just I want to get a full picture of the understanding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2643.005">I'm</a>  looking at it as I'm speaking for me personally and not the trust. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2648.37">But</a>  when we're using <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2652.16">public</a>  money to fund something. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2654.481">We</a>  want to make sure that we're using it responsibly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2656.901">Again,</a>  when I say we, I mean me because I don't want to speak behind or anybody, but we want to make, I want to make sure it's being done responsibly and making sure it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2667.965">And</a>  I understand you guys have been through the ringer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2670.826">I</a>  know about home. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2671.906">I</a>  know about the four year, uh, completion date and you guys are there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2680.995">I'm</a>  coming out and by completion, it means rented, like units, like heartbeats in those units. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2690.182">The</a>  deadlines that you guys are up against. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2692.403">So</a>  I just wanted to let you know.</p>

    <p>[Henry Rappa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2693.484">Home</a>  has been fairly accommodating with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2695.726">They're</a>  not forcing us to have it fully rented, which was a great relief because myself and the lottery agent, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2704.212">We're</a>  working feverishly under a lot of stress. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2707.193">And</a>  again, thank you to Catherine for helping us out so much with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2711.135">The</a>  home is going to make the last requisition payment, which, again, we all know with Washington, I was concerned if we didn't get that last payment, the next fiscal year, we may never have gotten it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2725.261">And</a>  then we would have had, and the contractor was made well aware of these things too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2732.042">Last</a>  December was a very tense time, to say the least, with her and her attorney. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2738.765">And</a>  David and I had, as he alluded to, we had some long conversations. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2744.148">And</a>  as they say, the devil you know sometimes is better than the devil you don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2748.35">She</a>  was compliant in the end, delivered a good product. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2753.332">I'm</a>  personally a little annoyed that we had the delays we did because it created a lot of stress on David and myself. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2760.355">but</a>  that's, I'm at least proud that we have a product that we can be using to help people in the community. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2768.566">With</a>  respect to your question on the damages penalty in that MOU, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2774.436">That</a>  is something when change orders come up and she's going to have change orders. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2778.637">We're</a>  well aware of that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2780.217">That</a>  that is something that is going to be negotiated as part of change or she she's going to have more change orders than what we're coming in asking for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2789.94">We're</a>  asking for the absolute least that we think we can use to complete out of this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2797.302">I,</a>  it's not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2799.302">I</a>  wanna make clear to the trustees, we're not coming in asking for more to give her more. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2804.524">We're</a>  asking for more just so we can get out of this without owing 200 grand that we don't have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2813.908">She's</a>  not gonna get a blank check out of this.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2817.69">No,</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2819.911">And</a>  that's not what I was suggesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2822.192">So</a>  if that was the perception, please, that's not the perception. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2828.399">That's</a>  not what I intended, excuse me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2831.282">I'm</a>  just looking at the documents, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2833.604">And</a>  when a completion, when something is completed and when something says that completion is all punch list items, that includes to me in my head, the way I interpret it is I've already got my change orders. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2847.956">I've</a>  already paid all of the things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2850.399">I'm</a>  probably only holding back 10% of each funding source <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2855.76">that</a>  is coming into play so that there's not a gift, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2862.183">So</a>  it's, I hear the pickle that you're in and I can appreciate the pickle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2868.446">I'm</a>  just trying to wrap my head around it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2871.007">Again,</a>  you have an agreement that is supposed to be somewhat, somewhat has some teeth to it and change orders are still coming in and things are still happening and the punch lists that are here <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2885.247">is</a>  not all associated with a national grid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2889.408">Therefore,</a>  I want, I, can you tell me why at least? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2895.989">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2897.689">To</a>  the chair, maybe since I think I heard earlier that we might not be voting on this tonight, maybe we should wait for full, full board anyway, and we, a little more time to review the documents, but maybe we can just make a list of what you want to see or what we want to see for that, for David and <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2919.492">to</a>  provide us before we take information, that they maybe have some time to gather and can get us a full picture. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2925.877">That</a>  sounds like a good thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2927.178">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2927.698">Maybe</a>  each item, you'll be spending the $200,000 on itemized by amount, and then any other concerns.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2936.945">Yeah,</a>  and I was just thinking, like, more so, like, look, have you toyed with the idea, maybe not penalizing the full $500 per day, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2947.228">maybe</a>  there is a little bit something that you can do a penalty per day for some of the items. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2953.873">I'm</a>  just trying to think creatively as well as.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2957.275">No,</a>  that's a very useful suggestion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2962.278">And</a>  my approach to this was going to be that we have to get our architects and Henry and <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2975.117">the,</a>  uh, and the contractor in a room together and, and, uh, you know, the contractor is as contractors do, they're trying to get as much as they can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=2989.119">And</a>  we are going to sit there with our, um, review of the, um, of the change orders and, and get them cut down to something we think is very reasonable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3006.851">and</a>  appropriate to what was done, and not just, you know, because this subcontractor handed a bill, then all of a sudden, you know, we owe it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3024.054">But</a>  also, we do have the liquid data damages, and that can be part of this discussion as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3034.544">But</a>  I think you would be wrong to go into that discussion with empty pockets, which puts us in a really bad position, frankly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3048.827">So</a>  again, we're happy to work with you on this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3056.068">We're</a>  happy to get you any information that you're looking for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3059.109">And</a>  we can certainly provide you with a breakdown. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3064.433">But</a>  until we've had the big powwow and sat down with everybody and closed the books on this thing, some of it is still subject to a little bit of variation here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3085.213">And</a>  I would ask your indulgence in that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3090.1">You</a>  know, we can try to show you where the big cost drivers are, certainly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3096.625">But</a>  some of it is going to take some tough negotiation here.</p>

    <p>[Henry Rappa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3105.672">Also,</a>  one more quick thing on liquidated damages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3109.055">I</a>  have a fairly good idea of how her attorney, who's an experienced construction attorney, is going to approach it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3116.884">And</a>  he's going to obviously come at this from a perspective that we didn't have power, we didn't have the electrical, so that we really don't have a right to assess liquidated damages against him. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3133.958">My</a>  feeling is that as soon as National Grid gets that electrical line hooked up, at that point, the $500 today does start immediately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3143.826">I</a>  think prior to that, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3146.719">It's</a>  going to be a bit of a negotiation in a perfect world. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3149.561">We</a>  would have had our power on that property on June 15 and I would have been able to send a letter to her attorney on June 16 saying we are now enforcing the full teeth of the liquidated damages clause. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3164.018">their</a>  argument's going to be that we weren't ready for a lease up anyways because we don't have power, so that we don't, that liquidated damages has now become a penalty and not a reimbursement for actual damages. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3183.113">I</a>  don't think he's gonna get tremendously far with it, but that is something I see them arguing, because the first thing anyone does with a liquidated damages clause is they always argue it's a penalty.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3196.712">So</a>  through the chair, can you, do you plan on, based on this meeting too, do you plan on maybe letting the developer know that once the national grid work is done, you're going to start instituting that penalty? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3208.899">Because</a>  not only is that in your MOU, but also in contract, but also because the affordable housing you trust in Medford, is it interested in potentially helping with this project and is making that somewhat of a recommendation or if you need us to make it a requirement, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3226.588">Maybe</a>  use that as a little help to get a project done.</p>

    <p>[Henry Rappa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3232.771">I</a>  think that does make sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3234.592">I</a>  mean, you know, one of the things I've tried to do with this contractor and her legal team is to work with them, but in a stern manner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3246.699">But</a>  certainly in this instance, yes, I can. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3250.847">The</a>  day the power is connected, I can send that letter to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3253.789">And</a>  I'm also going to let them know that, you know, we have heard from the Affordable Housing Trust that they want us to start enforcing this liquidated damages clause. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3266.955">The</a>  big thing for me, though. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3269.516">Yeah,</a>  the big thing is.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3270.837">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3272.798">I'll</a>  make a motion then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3276.201">we</a>  get an itemized breakdown of the $200,000, and they send a letter to the contractor within seven days, letting them know that we may be getting some funding from Affordable Housing Trust, but the trust is going to be requiring us to enforce the damage clause. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3297.417">So</a>  this is just forewarning that when National Grid is done, that punch list should also be done.</p>

    <p>[Henry Rappa]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3306.318">That</a>  does make good sense to me because at that point, once they have power, their argument that we're not suffering any damages because we couldn't lease up the property anyways is no longer valid. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3319.808">That's</a>  when any arguments that her legal team could have that it's a penalty rather than a reimbursement would be completely wiped out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3328.374">So</a>  I have no problem doing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3332.417">Yeah,</a>  hopefully she'll be done with her country.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3333.958">So</a>  we'll get you a list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3335.827">We'll</a>  get you a list that we're not really voting on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3338.688">Today</a>  was more of a presentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3340.949">We'll</a>  get you a list of all of the items that we would like to have at the next meeting that you are coming and actually asking for funding. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3353.053">And</a>  I will give you a snapshot, an updated performa. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3358.569">showing</a>  the actual costs is going to be this is the performer that you gave us is um the original i want to see a updated one to the best of your ability okay well um that that we can start working on all right excellent did anybody else have any questions before we move on to the next item <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3382.898">do</a>  we need to talk about this list of items, or are we going to be doing that in a different part of a meeting?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3388.742">We</a>  can do that separately. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3392.284">We</a>  can each separately send Catherine a list of what we'd like to see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3396.566">But</a>  just don't CC everybody.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3399.028">Everybody.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3399.448">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3400.188">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3401.089">And</a>  then Catherine will get that list to you all. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3403.891">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3404.891">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3405.772">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3407.2">All</a>  right, excellent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3408.36">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3409.06">You</a>  are more than welcome to stay for the rest of our meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3412.281">But</a>  if you want to go, thank you very much for joining us today, introducing the project.</p>

    <p>[David Brosnan]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3424.904">All</a>  right, well, thank you very much for hearing us today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3431.665">And</a>  we'll be working very hard to get you everything you're looking for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3437.28">And</a>  it's been.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3451.193">Approval.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3453.355">All</a>  of the minute minute minute for. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3479.997">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3481.217">To</a>  review the minute meetings from May, June and July. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3490.879">Yes,</a>  a motion to approve. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3494.9">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3498.163">Then</a>  we'll do a roll call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3500.925">All</a>  right, and then the next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3503.406">Is</a>  the next round and there were no applications. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3536.808">All</a>  right, so the next item on the agenda is we're going back to item three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3545.412">There</a>  were no applications from the NOFA that we released earlier this year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3550.535">The</a>  trust may discuss how to proceed with issuing future funding, including potential transition to accepting applications on a rolling basis throughout the year.</p>

    <p>[Katherine Buckingham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3563.641">Also,</a>  I did want to, I printed out, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3566.625">information</a>  from legal counsel about the ability to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3570.388">It</a>  sounds like that should not be an issue in terms of doing a ruling application, but just in case you wanted to review.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3619.097">So</a>  we can transfer, transition from, although we did the RFP this time around, I think it was fairly good RFP because we had so little money and hopefully one day we will have a lot of money and developers can come.</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3636.602">Just</a>  one question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3637.842">Was</a>  there any expressions of interest and just people couldn't make the deadline or was there really just no?</p>

    <p>[Katherine Buckingham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3644.504">No,</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3646.044">I</a>  wasn't involved when it was distributed, so I'm not <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3649.11">exactly</a>  how wide the audience was, but I think it's just because the trust is new. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3654.434">There's</a>  not as much recognition of that opportunity for funding or awareness. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3659.819">So</a>  that's something that the board can keep in mind for future.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3664.443">Through</a>  the chair, do we have a sense, you know, I know on our NOFA we stated like how much money we have to apply for, if it's rolling, is there a way to kind of like <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3676.397">Or</a>  would we even want to? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3677.498">I'm</a>  just throwing out the idea that we wouldn't have a ticker of how much money we have available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3683.181">I'm</a>  just curious how folks think that part would work in terms of a rolling option.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3688.084">So</a>  in my experience, it's once we start getting funding applications, we would ask the trust staff to do financials to show us what we have in our account, what we haven't committed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3703.208">so</a>  we're not overextending ourselves. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3705.971">That's</a>  how I've seen it done in other ways. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3708.994">So,</a>  you know, and especially like developers, there's a lot of feedback that we got from the developers and when we did the stakeholder meetings, like being flexible in our application process, making sure that we're taking applications <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3729.219">in</a>  a timely manner, so they can get their one-stop application for the state. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3734.043">I'm</a>  trying to actually trying to get the funding for the one-stop application and all their commitments. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3749.838">And</a>  so, I mean, this doing it based on a role, I think may benefit <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3756.058">the</a>  developers more so than doing another app RFP.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3759.42">Can</a>  I ask one more question? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3761.842">I</a>  guess I'm asking it out loud to all of us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3764.044">I</a>  don't know if you have the answer. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3768.407">Would</a>  we want, would we set like a standard practice, like timeline for us of like, you get something in and then at the next meeting we discuss it and then at what time for just thinking of like, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3779.376">for</a>  our own sake, kind of knowing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3781.276">And</a>  then also just if that's what we communicate out to developers, so they have a sense of like, if you get it in by now, it could be likely processed by us.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3788.998">Like</a>  deadlines that says if we're meeting the first Wednesday of the month, if you want your application to come in and to be reviewed at the meeting, you need to have everything submitted by X date. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3800.76">And</a>  that gives us time to review and stuff like that.</p>

    <p>[Penelope Taylor]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3803.101">And</a>  then we would review it on like X or try to commit to like a certain process that we would follow. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3808.342">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3809.783">I</a>  like deadlines a lot, so that, to me, seems like I would want that for us and to communicate out and to live with this.</p>

    <p>[Maria D'Orsi]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3817.006">Yeah,</a>  so I think just generally what I thought about the RFP process was that there'd be a somewhat standard process that would give the developers enough time to meet the standard EOHLC deadlines. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3831.371">I</a>  mean, they don't change them by, you know, more than two or three months every year, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3836.813">On</a>  top of that, it would also maybe give us room <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3839.232">have</a>  a standard kind of timeline throughout our year. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3841.332">So</a>  we're not constantly getting applications and also being able to assess the application sometimes, you know, in some way in competition with each other, this is a scarce resource. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3852.875">And</a>  if you give it to a very nice project at the beginning of the year, and you don't see the very nice project at the end of the year, I think having it all at once had a certain amount of appeal to me personally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3864.558">But</a>  I do understand we were new. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3866.845">You</a>  know, I think we were very quick to try to get some things out, which is great, but I think, um. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3872.188">Uh,</a>  yeah, we should try to assess how we want the regular schedule to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3878.571">And</a>  then if there's going to be 1 off things, maybe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3881.632">And</a>  do it on 1 off basis here and there.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3884.994">Yeah,</a>  no, I agree, especially with the limited amount of funding that we had this time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3889.616">It</a>  was a fair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3890.296">In</a>  the, uh. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3894.902">making</a>  sure that all the stakeholders have the ability to do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3899.366">I</a>  mean, we can continue the conversation when we have more trustees here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3904.27">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3905.931">Maybe</a>  that's a good idea, too, through the chair, because it seems like we've got no... Exactly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3915.339">The</a>  whole board can decide what to do with the 150 more and how much we can add to it.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3924.69">just</a>  to kind of go off of the mayor's, this application didn't come in within the deadline of our RFP. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3932.074">So</a>  if we're doing, this is why we're thinking about sort of broadening it out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3938.038">And</a>  it's not a complete, I mean, today wasn't an application, today was a presentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3943.882">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3944.302">An</a>  informal presentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3945.382">A</a>  very informal presentation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3947.804">But</a>  we can continue the conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3950.723">We</a>  have August, remind me, August 27th?</p>

    <p>[Katherine Buckingham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3953.805">Yes,</a>  the last Wednesday of August. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3956.707">And</a>  then also September 3rd, the next Wednesday is the annual meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3963.01">And</a>  just as a reminder, the August 27th, the vision behind that was that <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3971.498">this</a>  meeting we would review applications, should any have come in, and then the 27th we could invite people to come in to discuss. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3980.801">So</a>  that aspect is not relevant.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3984.943">So</a>  through the chair, will the 8th, 27th be canceled because no applications came in, so we only have to meet once that week?</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3994.986">I</a>  got the impression <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=3997.11">that</a>  these folks here, Medford Community Housing, is looking for a commitment from the trust sooner rather than later. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4013.754">That</a>  was my perception of what the conversation was, but it will depend on whether or not they're able to get a completed application in on whether or not <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4026.159">whether</a>  one of you can make a difference to them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4029.221">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4032.122">Maybe</a>  you can, when you send them the list of items, ask whether or not they can wait until the September meeting.</p>

    <p>[Katherine Buckingham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4040.106">Yeah,</a>  I'm happy to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4042.808">I</a>  will also just note that we have, in addition, I don't know how long we want to go, but discussion of the community meeting and input for the action plan. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4053.574">So</a>  that's just another topic <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4056.534">keep</a>  in mind that would require discussion as something.</p>

    <p>[UHZzywcUcK0_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4060.377">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4060.738">And</a>  I think maybe we can table that discussion if everybody is open to tabling the discussion of the community meeting to September, maybe the 27th or September whenever to another meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4078.974">I'm</a>  suggesting this only because the three trustee, like we were here, <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4084.496">I</a>  don't know Mayor, were you able to be on the, it was, I think you may have had a conflict at the Poet Laureate Ceremony. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4094.765">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4095.946">And</a>  to be able to present it to all the trustees when we're all here, does that suit? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4103.092">Are</a>  you open to table number three, five? <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4108.141">I</a>  think 6 or 5, 6, so we'll continue the conversation on table on on 3, a motion to table by. <a href="https://archive.org/details/affordable-housing-trust-08-13-25&start=4123.18">and</a>  six.</p>
