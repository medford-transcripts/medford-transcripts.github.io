1
00:00:01,564 --> 00:00:07,248
Hello everyone, we've got a quorum now, so I'm going to begin recording the meeting.

2
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:19,437
Thank you for your patience while we meet quorum here.

3
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:34,692
The meeting of the recording in progress for August 13 to order.

4
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:39,694
I just said all of that.

5
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:43,615
That happens.

6
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:47,556
We'll do it one more time calling the meeting to order.

7
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:52,778
Do a little bit of a roll call.

8
00:00:52,858 --> 00:00:55,779
We've got Kayla here, Roberta.

9
00:00:57,963 --> 00:00:58,423
Terry?

10
00:00:58,443 --> 00:01:01,064
Penny?

11
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:01,565
Here.

12
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:03,926
Mayor?

13
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:04,726
Madam Mayor?

14
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:04,966
Present.

15
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:06,587
Lisa?

16
00:01:06,787 --> 00:01:07,207
Here.

17
00:01:08,388 --> 00:01:08,808
Okay.

18
00:01:08,948 --> 00:01:17,412
And then we are going to, did we want to do the minutes first or do we want to do the- Let me just jump to the presentation first.

19
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:18,252
All right, perfect.

20
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:18,673
Thank you.

21
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:21,234
So we're going to take a couple of things out of order today.

22
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:25,836
We're going to move on to, jump right to either four,

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,692
Yes, Item 4, 703 Felsway West funded inquiry.

24
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:47,898
As indicated in the email staff sent from the city, the city staff sent, the developers of 703 Felsway West will be providing a present project and anticipated request for funding.

25
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:51,860
Great.

26
00:01:52,374 --> 00:01:52,814
All right.

27
00:01:52,954 --> 00:01:56,617
Well, thank you, Madam Mayor and Madam Chair.

28
00:01:56,837 --> 00:02:02,741
My name is David Brosnan, and I am a board member and an officer.

29
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,962
I'm the treasurer of Metro Community Housing.

30
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:08,745
Also joining us is our president, Henry Grappa.

31
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:10,566
Good evening, everyone.

32
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:15,069
He is remote, as you can see.

33
00:02:19,644 --> 00:02:35,967
The purpose of our presentation tonight is to explore the possibility of getting a few more dollars to finish up our project at 703 Felsway West.

34
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:41,909
Our project is very close to final completion, and we are

35
00:02:45,642 --> 00:03:04,496
frankly, still getting the bills in from, on both the hard costs, the construction side and the soft costs side, the consultants and the various design professionals that we've had to engage to get it going.

36
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:09,360
I hope not to take up very much of your time tonight.

37
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,643
I can give you a little bit of the history of the project.

38
00:03:13,422 --> 00:03:21,346
This project was first thought up back in, I think, 2018 or 2019.

39
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:38,276
Our original presentations to the CPC, to the North Suburban Home Consortium, and to the bank, which was then Century Bank.

40
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:41,257
It's now Eastern Bank, were made in

41
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:48,609
2019.

42
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:48,609
Funding was approved in 2022.

43
00:03:50,131 --> 00:03:57,316
Construction started midway through the year in 2023.

44
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:09,505
And the construction end has run into, quite frankly, a few snags, a few overruns.

45
00:04:09,946 --> 00:04:11,787
And we've been working very hard

46
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:16,152
with the contractor to try to keep costs under control.

47
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:35,557
At one point, our project was kind of, we decided that we would, in understanding with the contractor, we worked to,

48
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:45,417
set aside some of our gripes and some of their gripes and try to get the project done and push toward completion.

49
00:04:47,018 --> 00:04:48,918
We are now in the punch list.

50
00:04:56,528 --> 00:05:04,354
and just make sure it all meets with the specifications and the drawings that have been made.

51
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:08,156
We did have to make some tough choices along the way.

52
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:18,783
We had to kind of to control costs because costs have risen, frankly, during the time that the project has been going on.

53
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:21,645
So this morning I ran some of the

54
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:28,544
a computer here.

55
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:32,227
I keep getting tongue tied on this.

56
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:41,653
The consumer product, consumer, what are they?

57
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:43,214
Calculator.

58
00:05:43,974 --> 00:05:49,097
And we looked at it at three milestones.

59
00:05:49,157 --> 00:05:52,880
So since we signed the contract with the contractor,

60
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:58,546
So part of this is inflation driven.

61
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:06,049
So project driven, and we can talk about the project stuff later.

62
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:14,431
But since we signed the contract in 2023, we've had 5.9% inflation.

63
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:17,732
Since we got our funding approved, 5%.

64
00:06:23,646 --> 00:06:24,507
Inflation.

65
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:34,212
And since we wrote the pro forma that has been circulated to everyone, we've had 20.9%.

66
00:06:34,332 --> 00:06:41,917
Requesting will be roughly 12% or about $200,000 if it's agreeable to the board.

67
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:45,579
We are certainly willing to talk about that.

68
00:06:56,353 --> 00:07:21,383
uh from our point of view to see that we could pay the deal with the change orders that have come through and also recoup some of the soft costs that have been on so we pay an architect

69
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:26,352
uh, to be our site eyes and ears and to look at things.

70
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:31,577
And he, um, he actually assembled the punch lists, um, that you've seen.

71
00:07:31,597 --> 00:07:41,746
Hey, you know, he's indispensable to the project and, uh, he came in at a very critical time.

72
00:07:41,766 --> 00:07:44,869
Um, he, he, he's a terrific, um,

73
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:52,784
has a terrific eye for things and has given us excellent service and advice, but he sends a bill every month.

74
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:56,887
And as long as the project goes on, he'll be doing that.

75
00:07:57,507 --> 00:08:02,750
So that's one example of a project driven cost.

76
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:11,936
Other examples are the fact that certain things that were specified on the drawings

77
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:23,253
by the designing architect, Don Valenti, are no longer made or are no longer available.

78
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:28,915
We look for something of equivalent quality and value.

79
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:36,318
And oftentimes, we are finding that it's costing more to do that.

80
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:37,939
We have had to

81
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:41,892
We've had to make some decisions.

82
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:45,473
And one example of that is the flooring.

83
00:08:46,473 --> 00:09:08,877
We have vinyl sheet flooring in every room of the building except for the bathrooms, which have ceramic tile, and maybe the front lobby, which is going to have a heavy duty carpet that will clean your shoes as you walk in.

84
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:22,564
And there have been, I'll be very honest, it seems to have been, this one, a tough project.

85
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:24,404
The site was very tough.

86
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:36,387
We thought, initially, the excavation went very well, up where we were expecting all the ledge to be, at the back of the lot.

87
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:46,043
But where we ran into the real excavation fight, where we were running into ledge all the time, was kind of down toward the sidewalk.

88
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:49,744
And when we were trying to get utility lines through.

89
00:09:50,284 --> 00:09:57,247
And that turned into just a lot of stops and starts.

90
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,767
We can discuss any of this, but

91
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,623
We think that we've been prudent in the things that we've done.

92
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:34,819
One other thing that when our last winter early this year, when things were stalled, we did sit down with the contractor and her attorney and with Henry, we negotiated a memorandum of understanding that I've included

93
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:47,639
with the contract, to make sure that we had an enforceable target date and some consequence if the target date wasn't met.

94
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,562
Now, in a perfect world, we'd be collecting money every day.

95
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:59,947
Unfortunately, we can't hold our contractor responsible for National Grid.

96
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:07,675
And National Grid is the one that we've still got here.

97
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:10,598
National Grid has not hooked up to power.

98
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:23,290
Their legal team told us earlier this year that they've changed the way that they want to bring power onto our site.

99
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:27,804
the house next door that we own, the power came into the back of the house.

100
00:11:28,884 --> 00:11:36,288
National Grid is now planning, and we expect it to happen within days of this meeting.

101
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:50,654
If everything we're told comes out right, and this is in fact what will be the case, they plan to put a new utility pole

102
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,441
right on the corner or next to our lot out on the Pell's Way.

103
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:01,022
They have to arrange a state police detail to do that.

104
00:12:01,742 --> 00:12:04,383
And they're going to connect our power to that.

105
00:12:05,123 --> 00:12:18,787
That alone caused the change order because the electrician now had to bring the electric service connection out back to the house.

106
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,187
And I can regale you with

107
00:12:23,685 --> 00:12:41,934
But we think that this project will get done very quickly after the power is hooked up.

108
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:46,176
We wish to invite everyone to our grand opening.

109
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:58,724
And we would respectfully ask you to consider a grant of $200,000 or up to $200,000 on this.

110
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:03,064
And we would be happy to entertain any comments or questions that you have.

111
00:13:03,104 --> 00:13:03,625
We understand

112
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:29,000
You're not going to decide this tonight, but we're certainly happy to provide any information you need.

113
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:48,791
We've downloaded the application, and it was just my own schedule prevented me from getting it complete in time for the... Our recollection is three units,

114
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:51,593
Do you restrict it in perpetuity?

115
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:53,055
Yes, yes.

116
00:13:54,356 --> 00:14:02,963
So we have just about all of our funding, the bank requires that.

117
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:11,890
And so we have one single bedroom unit and we have two three bedroom units.

118
00:14:12,711 --> 00:14:15,133
We believed at the time of design

119
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:19,319
that the three bedroom unit was a lot better for families.

120
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,902
They might have a boy or girl that they could.

121
00:14:29,726 --> 00:14:35,970
And we believe we're going to find a lot of applicants for this.

122
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:45,137
We've engaged an affordable lottery agent

123
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,712
fair marketing agent to assist us in this.

124
00:14:50,033 --> 00:15:09,368
And, um... And we saw, through the chair, we saw any other table grants that have gone back to home or... Well, from what we're getting from Malden on that, um, we've...

125
00:15:13,008 --> 00:15:17,191
We don't think there's any home money left, actually.

126
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:20,733
Did you file an application on the city's current CPC route?

127
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:35,123
Well, we were in the process of doing that and we were encouraged maybe to make this stop first and to see because given the timeframes involved and given the

128
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:43,056
the fact that we had already received grants from the CPC.

129
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:55,742
And given their cycle of funding, we were, Catherine and Teresa encouraged us to explore this.

130
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:59,784
And so this is our stop.

131
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:06,519
As far as have we, have we looked at other things?

132
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:19,235
Well, I can tell you, um, metric community housing has, has, um, if you look at the developers fee, well,

133
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:25,928
We've spent a lot of that money trying to get the project done.

134
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:32,489
So we're not gonna walk away with a lot of money in our treasury to spend.

135
00:16:32,849 --> 00:16:35,970
Our priority is to get this done, get tenants in there.

136
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:43,772
And I would not presume to do so.

137
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:49,513
The contractor on the last five requisitions has not marked up.

138
00:16:51,237 --> 00:16:55,360
overhead and profit on the project.

139
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,045
So that is a significant amount of money between the two of us.

140
00:17:03,226 --> 00:17:16,797
And again, we think, you know, just judging at the bills that are coming in and the bills that we already have pending,

141
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:35,161
And the amount we've spent on soft costs and on construction, the amount I've mentioned would just hit the sweet spot and put us in the right place.

142
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:41,165
And we can, there are any other questions?

143
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:41,705
I guess.

144
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,867
There's a couple of questions here.

145
00:17:43,927 --> 00:17:45,728
I have some as well, but I'm gonna hold off.

146
00:17:45,968 --> 00:17:46,249
Penny?

147
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:47,289
Yeah, thanks to the chair.

148
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:57,355
kind of to your last point, I was wondering, you said the ask is a little conservative, so I just, I didn't all admit I got these documents right before, so if it's in them, I apologize, but.

149
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,737
Well, they were just created right before.

150
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:03,398
But will this finish the project?

151
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:05,198
Is this what you need?

152
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:13,902
Do you need, is this the real amount that you will need to complete this project and get all the finished?

153
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:22,069
Books have not been closed on the project and won't be until every sub.

154
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:36,333
And we also have a period of negotiation with the general contractor for what is covered by an allowance, what is a legitimate change order, and what is not.

155
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:40,494
We have our opinions about those things.

156
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:44,635
We are not going to pay the contractor for doing rework.

157
00:18:46,082 --> 00:18:48,783
of things that were found to be unacceptable.

158
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:55,846
And we are not going to pay for things we've already paid for once.

159
00:18:56,547 --> 00:18:59,868
So all of those things have to be scrutinized.

160
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:09,433
And we are going to look at those very hard and try to get that number down as low as possible.

161
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,535
We know that there's no bottomless pit

162
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:19,805
of money, and no one's more aware of it than we are.

163
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:25,888
But the project is at like 98% right now of completion.

164
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:34,192
So if you, and we invite you to do so, if you want to come to the site, give me a call and I'll walk you through.

165
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:37,453
There are three apartments there with appliances.

166
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:48,114
and I think locks on the doors as of today, and running water.

167
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:58,536
And the only thing we don't have is working electricity off the street yet, where we're kind of patching the power through from our adjacent property.

168
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:03,837
But, Henry, I don't know if you have,

169
00:20:08,594 --> 00:20:23,966
The email that we got from the contract showing some pictures of some of the punch list items that were being completed in the last couple of days.

170
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:26,248
I can certainly try to pull that up.

171
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:31,852
I want to jump in with a couple of quick things too before we get into the question period.

172
00:20:32,012 --> 00:20:33,854
These are going to be local action units.

173
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:44,294
I'm told by our lottery agent that they have already approved the marketing plan.

174
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:52,578
And- So DHCD has approved that, is that- Yes, correct.

175
00:20:52,658 --> 00:20:53,259
Okay.

176
00:20:53,339 --> 00:21:01,763
And one of the things I wanted to point out to the trustees is that we really kept a lid on all

177
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:13,289
Costs David and myself have given a lot countless hours of free time to the project.

178
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:15,131
I have done all the legal work.

179
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:21,200
with the contractor's attorney without cost.

180
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,783
David has been over there practically every week at meetings.

181
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:29,587
We've really kept a tight grip on it.

182
00:21:29,847 --> 00:21:31,488
Our executive director retired.

183
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:39,295
We did not fill that petition because we've used whatever free cash we've had to pour back into the project.

184
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:47,080
I would shudder to think if we actually, David's experience in construction, I am as well.

185
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:51,403
Because of that, we've been able really to keep things on track.

186
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:57,847
We've picked up problems before they could become more of an issue.

187
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,269
When the zip board was installed in the spring of 2024,

188
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:11,761
The zip board sent by the supplier had mold on it and it was installed.

189
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:16,707
The contractor had to remove it and reinstall it at her expense.

190
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,335
David and I frequently were at this project trying to make sure things stayed

191
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:23,677
on the rails.

192
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:36,027
So, when we're coming in asking for more money, I do want all of you to understand that it wasn't as any result of not budgeting properly or not watching things.

193
00:22:36,748 --> 00:22:38,710
We made some good cuts when we could.

194
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:41,872
The site was definitely challenging with the utilities.

195
00:22:42,353 --> 00:22:46,796
And just the general core inflation, as David said, this budget was set

196
00:22:47,796 --> 00:22:51,199
in 2022 with home.

197
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,063
And the real problem we're seeing now, I know there was a question about did we go back to home.

198
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:03,491
I shudder to think what's going to happen in the future with federal funding of projects like this.

199
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:07,152
It seems to me like that's an adage of the past.

200
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:17,013
You know, we try as a community housing organization to do something that some of the other affordable housing developers are not doing.

201
00:23:17,113 --> 00:23:24,415
We try to have units that will accommodate a family, that will allow for families to be part of the community.

202
00:23:26,553 --> 00:23:35,838
And a key point that David brought up is we're not even getting a semblance of the developer's fee that was anticipated in the beginning.

203
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:38,099
And that developer's fee doesn't line anyone's pockets.

204
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,841
A developer's fee is what helps our organizational bottom line.

205
00:23:43,321 --> 00:23:51,825
But again, that's where David and I running the organization without the executive director, we've been able to save that money for a period of eight months.

206
00:23:52,386 --> 00:23:54,467
It's helped us get through this period of

207
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,128
of expenses.

208
00:23:56,248 --> 00:24:02,032
And really, you know, to the contractors, I give her credit too.

209
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:12,480
I mean, she is not making anything on this project because the cost overruns had been, just the inflationary cost overruns had been a real problem for everybody.

210
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,041
I think

211
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:20,078
You know, doing it on a tight budget is a good thing, but this has been really challenging for us.

212
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:26,584
And that's why we're coming back and asking for a bit more just to close out the books.

213
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:40,455
Like David had said, we have a consultant who's been invaluable in making sure that the project went smoothly, that there were not errors, and he'd been on site checking to see that

214
00:24:41,608 --> 00:24:47,590
things have been done properly, so we can be proud of the project is built.

215
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,291
So I just wanted to jump in with those points.

216
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:57,892
And I know you have questions, and David is happy to answer them, and I am as well.

217
00:24:57,912 --> 00:25:01,573
And I'd just add to what Henry said,

218
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:16,182
I'm not sure, well, this is an affordable housing trust, so you must be familiar with the term what percent of AMI area mean income, median income.

219
00:25:17,162 --> 00:25:28,847
These units are intended for 60% AMI, which is far lower in amount of income than most developers

220
00:25:30,172 --> 00:25:37,457
who throw a few affordable units into a much larger development.

221
00:25:37,878 --> 00:25:43,342
They tend to be up around 75, 80%, if not more of AMI.

222
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:55,410
So we think we're doing a service and we think we've held the line as far as we possibly could.

223
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,392
I don't think we'd be responsible.

224
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:10,861
if we didn't try to make sure that the books were balanced and try to close it out as efficiently as possible.

225
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,203
Did you have any other questions?

226
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:16,125
Any, Caleb, do you have any questions?

227
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:18,407
No, I think that's it.

228
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:18,847
I do.

229
00:26:19,768 --> 00:26:20,528
So thank you.

230
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:22,470
You answered my question about AMIs.

231
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,651
So I'm glad to hear 60% AMI.

232
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:28,451
Glad to hear the tenant selection plan has been approved.

233
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:31,773
And it sounds like HLC has approved the tenant selection plan.

234
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:33,193
Is that what I heard?

235
00:26:33,473 --> 00:26:36,135
HLC Housing and Community Living Development.

236
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:40,537
State agency, DHC.

237
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:42,959
Last known as DHCD.

238
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:45,420
They change those letters all the time.

239
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,261
I'm sorry, let me rephrase that.

240
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:50,023
Who approved the tenant selection plan?

241
00:26:52,160 --> 00:27:08,079
My understanding is I still call him DHC CD as well, but it's been approved by the appropriate successor agency to that what we use services for our housing lottery agent.

242
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:08,119
I.

243
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:15,503
Explain to them in depth, and I believe Catherine Buckingham has been fabulous.

244
00:27:15,543 --> 00:27:17,424
She's helped a lot with that.

245
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,865
We've got the local action unit application.

246
00:27:20,985 --> 00:27:26,588
Everything the affordable housing restriction, which was recorded at the time of her financing.

247
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:34,391
D. H. well, the new agency is reviewing that I've worked with them before on a few occasions.

248
00:27:35,351 --> 00:27:40,775
To put things together in quick order, so it's my understanding.

249
00:27:40,895 --> 00:27:48,860
We should be ready to start advertising before leasing these units out because obviously for us, we want 2 things.

250
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,142
We want to get people into this lovely new building.

251
00:27:52,642 --> 00:27:55,043
We also want to be able to get some of the rental stream.

252
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:58,386
They help carry cover our carrying costs.

253
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:04,009
I mean, obvious we're still paying insurance and taxes and utilities on this structure.

254
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,450
We want to get people in there.

255
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:20,981
And the good news is, you know, I'm told we're moving along at a very quick pace on that, which is something that I'm relieved at, because I really need this building occupied by, say, late October.

256
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:26,351
I think that would be ideal.

257
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:33,416
The question was asked about home money, and I heard that it sounds like Malden says there's no more home money.

258
00:28:33,476 --> 00:28:44,645
Is that because you've reached the maximum allowed for maximum subsidy per unit for this development, or is there just no more home money available?

259
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:52,692
We have not checked on what the current maximum subsidy per unit

260
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,286
is right now.

261
00:28:55,306 --> 00:28:58,587
It goes back to the date of the poll memo.

262
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:01,329
Then we did, we did max that out.

263
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,290
That's why there's no more funding available.

264
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:15,995
But Paul Goldstein this morning told me, and I was, I was kind of asking, you know, you know, to include people when we, when we finally open the place.

265
00:29:16,756 --> 00:29:19,377
I asked, is there anyone in the Boston POT office?

266
00:29:19,437 --> 00:29:21,518
He says, I don't think there's anyone left.

267
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:42,987
the bus there is there is there's at least one person i don't know she's visiting there but so that was kind of surprising to me because i i think they do they do a lot uh and uh i i'm not well i will hope yeah that's funny opinion

268
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:45,180
No, we'll, we'll keep this here.

269
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:55,346
I've got a couple more questions and I apologize, but I'm looking at everything and you say you've got an estimate of $200,000 to get this through the finish line and everybody don't get me wrong.

270
00:29:55,366 --> 00:29:58,007
Like I, everybody, we're here to create housing.

271
00:29:58,027 --> 00:30:05,031
We're here to put in people in affordable housing, but looking at it and looking at the numbers and you know, your contract.

272
00:30:05,642 --> 00:30:12,549
here that you shared with us is the same amount of your MOU.

273
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:21,357
And what I read through the MOU was it was stopped because of getting, because of price increases, right?

274
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:24,340
Well, I would say we got to a point with,

275
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,412
The contractor was not moving expeditiously.

276
00:30:34,892 --> 00:30:38,215
The project was behind schedule significantly.

277
00:30:38,235 --> 00:30:47,442
There were some disagreements with the contractor about what we would pay for and what we would not pay for.

278
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:59,172
And there was, at the time, some discussion about, you know, is this worth finishing?

279
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:09,226
And we came to the decision that we did not want to leave a half-finished building there.

280
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:22,236
We did not see that getting, trying to go after the contractor's bond or firing the contractor and trying to bring a new contractor in.

281
00:31:25,178 --> 00:31:27,239
The advice we got after,

282
00:31:28,825 --> 00:31:48,616
talking to people we know and and and what was that we would double the cost of what was remaining you know if we had spent half the money at that point we'd need much much more than we're talking about we're probably talking now about

283
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:56,746
you know, probably seven or eight hundred thousand dollars that we'd have to add to our budget because of that.

284
00:31:57,386 --> 00:31:57,727
So.

285
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:08,276
Because the contractors would simply mark up the price because they were walking into a bad situation.

286
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:16,222
Had we tried to approach it from a point of putting a claim against the bonds?

287
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:17,944
Well, our

288
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:29,369
What we found out there was that the first thing the insurance company, who writes the bond, would do would be to try to mediate the whole situation.

289
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,213
And we said, well, we don't need to go through all that exercise.

290
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:38,978
We can sit down with the contractor ourselves, and we can work it.

291
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:46,264
So to get this project up and going again, and to push it toward completion,

292
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:50,498
Metric community housing had to set aside a few of our gripes.

293
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,501
And the contractor had to set aside a few of their things.

294
00:32:56,002 --> 00:33:16,437
What greatly encouraged us to move on this path was that, as you see in the MOU, the contractor agreed that other than certain defined areas, that the bulk of the project would be delivered

295
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,550
under the original contract amount.

296
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:26,395
And that is why we stayed with that contractor and pursued the memo of understanding.

297
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:32,200
And even at that, here I am today.

298
00:33:33,901 --> 00:33:37,904
I appreciate you walking me through one more time.

299
00:33:38,405 --> 00:33:43,969
National grid, it sounds, so through this, if they didn't meet their target date,

300
00:33:44,513 --> 00:33:48,334
after, I think it was June 16th, a $500 fine, I'm going to call it.

301
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:49,655
I believe it's $250 a day.

302
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:50,395
I'm not sure it's $500.

303
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:50,635
Yep, $500.

304
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:57,538
Results in liquidated damages of $500 for each calendar day after June 16th is what I see here.

305
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:15,027
You're saying that part of it, you can't charge them for something that they have no control over.

306
00:34:15,047 --> 00:34:16,988
That's national grade.

307
00:34:17,028 --> 00:34:26,994
So my question is how much of this $200,000 is actually associated with, let me rephrase that question.

308
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:30,537
How much of these punch lists can get done?

309
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:37,341
And does any of these punch list items associate with this additional $200,000?

310
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:46,258
I don't think it's broken out in quite that way.

311
00:34:46,278 --> 00:35:01,466
I think we're seeing, and those that are piling up, I don't think it's a matter of them get, I mean, the punch list items will be done

312
00:35:03,077 --> 00:35:06,658
imminently almost irrespective of this.

313
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:13,140
It is not, you can see there is a section of the punch list that's national grid related things.

314
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:20,583
But what I guess, I guess my, I want to be clear in my question, right?

315
00:35:20,603 --> 00:35:23,404
Because I understand that this project has been going on.

316
00:35:23,424 --> 00:35:30,246
I understand that it's been speed bumps and there are hiccups going on with the development, inflation going on with the development.

317
00:35:30,566 --> 00:35:30,826
There's,

318
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:43,837
If I did my math correctly, it is over $460,000 per unit of subsidy that went into the property, what is going into the property.

319
00:35:43,997 --> 00:35:54,821
I'm looking at this and it says that if it's not completed by the date of, I think it is June, completion date of June 10th.

320
00:35:55,461 --> 00:35:58,282
And I understand like there are some things that are beyond the control,

321
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:14,188
but when you think about completion date, according to the MOU says that includes the, and the punch, there's quite some, there's still a lot of items here that are not necessarily related to the national grid.

322
00:36:14,908 --> 00:36:17,768
So I'm just thinking about dollars.

323
00:36:17,888 --> 00:36:27,870
I'm just thinking about, you know, you all are taking, just taking a big hunk of it already with your developers fee, developers sounds like,

324
00:36:28,502 --> 00:36:36,657
There may be some sort of understanding with the contractor that you're not going to get hit with other other bills like it doesn't sound like that.

325
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:40,865
It sounds like they're they're not other bills that they're they're.

326
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:45,223
Labor and stuff, they're staying within costs, right?

327
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:53,744
With the exception of change orders that may have been necessitated by different circumstances.

328
00:36:53,764 --> 00:36:58,485
We definitely had more issues with the utilities in the lower part.

329
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:01,786
I mean, that was, they had a really hard time getting the water line in.

330
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:11,288
But basically what she agreed to do was hold the line on her costs and do what she was supposed to do at that charge.

331
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:23,613
We run into the issue, as David was saying, we have other costs, additional architectural costs, additional consulting costs, things that have increased by inflation.

332
00:37:24,354 --> 00:37:31,197
We could make the change on the hardwood floor to the vinyl plank without in any way jeopardizing the integrity of the product.

333
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:33,858
But there are some issues that we just can't.

334
00:37:34,358 --> 00:37:37,960
When I looked at it, and I looked at it from the substantial completion,

335
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,682
Idea, she she does believe me.

336
00:37:41,782 --> 00:37:53,371
I've held her feet to the fire in that of her attorney She you know, we were up against home being right getting our last disbursement by a point in september or we weren't going to get it.

337
00:37:53,611 --> 00:38:03,619
We I held Both her attorney and her feet to the fire Really with putting some fear into them of what was going to happen

338
00:38:04,768 --> 00:38:07,790
This project didn't get done the substantial completion.

339
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,812
They did a good job of getting close to that June 16th date.

340
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:13,293
It should never have been that long.

341
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:19,596
I'm the 1st to say it drove me crazy and took whatever here I had and made the rest fall out.

342
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:21,437
But the reality is.

343
00:38:22,498 --> 00:38:32,421
A lot of the things now, like testing the fire department system, and the electrical services, and all of those things are really related to national grid holding us up.

344
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:41,463
And another example that David had brought up was the moving of the electrical panel, because on the plans, it was supposed to be in the back.

345
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:43,843
They were originally supposed to put a pole in the back.

346
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:49,945
And then midstream, or not even midstream, at the end of the stream, they decided they were going to change the location of the pole.

347
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:53,084
Which, you know, created the cost.

348
00:38:54,204 --> 00:39:02,028
And we're not the type of developer that can pass that on to the people who are renting or the purchasers of the units.

349
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:04,189
It comes out of our pocket.

350
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:06,910
Thankfully, you know, we had the developer fee.

351
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,592
Well, we don't have the developer fee, but that acted as a cushion for us that we could.

352
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:27,583
survive and pay a few things out of that and you know, we didn't have to retain legal counsel to deal with the contractor's attorney and David had done a lot of assistance when they were questions that came up about you know Structural things and water lines and things like that.

353
00:39:27,623 --> 00:39:38,811
He's able to give it expertise, you know, I'm always Cautious and we have to come back and ask for money because I never want I take David and I take a lot of this

354
00:39:40,185 --> 00:39:46,272
We would never want anyone to think we didn't do a good job with our original target and that we're off.

355
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:55,842
I think between the inflation and between a few of the things that were really unforeseen, like the national grid, I don't know why they were so unreasonable.

356
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:58,485
I don't know why they forced us to do it in the front.

357
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,387
I don't know why they've taken so long.

358
00:40:00,988 --> 00:40:03,649
They also tied my hands because you make a good point.

359
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:10,312
If I had all the electrical installed in there, then I can go to the contractor in good faith and say you missed a target date.

360
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:18,696
But the first if I go after her, the first word her experienced attorney is going to say to me is you haven't delivered me electrical power yet.

361
00:40:20,204 --> 00:40:33,272
But Henry, I hear what you're saying and I can appreciate the national grid and the head of it that comes along with it because I experienced it in my day job as well.

362
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:38,656
However, I'm looking at the thing and I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.

363
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:48,262
It sounds like you guys have done a really good job at trying to mediate with your contractor, but I'm looking at this and it says that for the completion,

364
00:40:48,852 --> 00:41:10,227
In the completion of all punch list items identified by the consultant and taking off your electric, taking off anything that goes on with the national grid, there are items on this punch list that was provided today that are not associated with the national grid, right?

365
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:17,512
So I understand that there's some things that are beyond your contractor's control, national grid beyond the contractor's control,

366
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,124
but there are things on this punch list as dated.

367
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:29,069
I guess it was dated 730, which is past June 16th.

368
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,952
As of today, there are only a few highlighted items.

369
00:41:33,852 --> 00:41:36,374
Is there any movement?

370
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:42,358
Is there any more negotiation that you can do with the contractor?

371
00:41:42,818 --> 00:41:46,360
I hear that you guys have been through the wringer already,

372
00:41:48,597 --> 00:42:12,322
just trying to think about dollars just trying to think about you know what ifs you know you gotta have a plan b what where's where's your plan b and going and having something where you have a document which i heard was enforceable for everything for everything except for things that are beyond their control the item number one uh

373
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:20,551
procure and install hydraulic radiation units and stairwells, wash or dryer room.

374
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:23,673
Does that have to do with national grid?

375
00:42:24,373 --> 00:42:39,325
Install panel board covers on apartments, sub-panel locations, intercoms, HM doors, install glass lights at HM doors and basement.

376
00:42:39,365 --> 00:42:42,768
Like some of these things are not necessarily associated with

377
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:45,302
national grid items.

378
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,404
True, some of them are not.

379
00:42:51,646 --> 00:43:04,835
What can be a little bit of a complicating factor with deadlines is that when there are approved change orders, change orders generally represent two things.

380
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,918
First, a change in the contract amount.

381
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:11,140
And second,

382
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,581
a change in the deadline.

383
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:20,805
Oftentimes, a change order will say, this will add so many days to the deadline.

384
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:22,006
But you didn't supply that.

385
00:43:22,546 --> 00:43:32,533
I did not, because we have not been formally given all the change orders on the project just yet.

386
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:41,098
And this is one of the things that we're trying to head off here.

387
00:43:42,348 --> 00:43:45,511
All right.

388
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:51,736
Like I said, I'm just wrapping around the information that you provided, wrapping around the information that you shared with us.

389
00:43:52,356 --> 00:44:01,944
And, you know, things in writing, I just I want to get a full picture of the understanding.

390
00:44:03,005 --> 00:44:07,829
I'm looking at it as I'm speaking for me personally and not the trust.

391
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,010
But when we're using

392
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,441
public money to fund something.

393
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:16,881
We want to make sure that we're using it responsibly.

394
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:27,805
Again, when I say we, I mean me because I don't want to speak behind or anybody, but we want to make, I want to make sure it's being done responsibly and making sure it is.

395
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,666
And I understand you guys have been through the ringer.

396
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:31,806
I know about home.

397
00:44:31,906 --> 00:44:38,448
I know about the four year, uh, completion date and you guys are there.

398
00:44:40,995 --> 00:44:49,942
I'm coming out and by completion, it means rented, like units, like heartbeats in those units.

399
00:44:50,182 --> 00:44:52,383
The deadlines that you guys are up against.

400
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:53,464
So I just wanted to let you know.

401
00:44:53,484 --> 00:44:55,386
Home has been fairly accommodating with that.

402
00:44:55,726 --> 00:45:03,411
They're not forcing us to have it fully rented, which was a great relief because myself and the lottery agent,

403
00:45:04,212 --> 00:45:06,773
We're working feverishly under a lot of stress.

404
00:45:07,193 --> 00:45:10,055
And again, thank you to Catherine for helping us out so much with that.

405
00:45:11,135 --> 00:45:24,721
The home is going to make the last requisition payment, which, again, we all know with Washington, I was concerned if we didn't get that last payment, the next fiscal year, we may never have gotten it.

406
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:30,684
And then we would have had, and the contractor was made well aware of these things too.

407
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:37,965
Last December was a very tense time, to say the least, with her and her attorney.

408
00:45:38,765 --> 00:45:43,387
And David and I had, as he alluded to, we had some long conversations.

409
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:47,249
And as they say, the devil you know sometimes is better than the devil you don't.

410
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:52,031
She was compliant in the end, delivered a good product.

411
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:59,335
I'm personally a little annoyed that we had the delays we did because it created a lot of stress on David and myself.

412
00:46:00,355 --> 00:46:07,785
but that's, I'm at least proud that we have a product that we can be using to help people in the community.

413
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:12,871
With respect to your question on the damages penalty in that MOU,

414
00:46:14,436 --> 00:46:18,597
That is something when change orders come up and she's going to have change orders.

415
00:46:18,637 --> 00:46:19,617
We're well aware of that.

416
00:46:20,217 --> 00:46:29,900
That that is something that is going to be negotiated as part of change or she she's going to have more change orders than what we're coming in asking for.

417
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:36,401
We're asking for the absolute least that we think we can use to complete out of this.

418
00:46:37,302 --> 00:46:38,562
I, it's not.

419
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:44,384
I wanna make clear to the trustees, we're not coming in asking for more to give her more.

420
00:46:44,524 --> 00:46:53,808
We're asking for more just so we can get out of this without owing 200 grand that we don't have.

421
00:46:53,908 --> 00:46:56,409
She's not gonna get a blank check out of this.

422
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,671
No, I appreciate that.

423
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:02,152
And that's not what I was suggesting.

424
00:47:02,192 --> 00:47:07,234
So if that was the perception, please, that's not the perception.

425
00:47:08,399 --> 00:47:10,481
That's not what I intended, excuse me.

426
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:13,504
I'm just looking at the documents, right?

427
00:47:13,604 --> 00:47:27,836
And when a completion, when something is completed and when something says that completion is all punch list items, that includes to me in my head, the way I interpret it is I've already got my change orders.

428
00:47:27,956 --> 00:47:30,078
I've already paid all of the things.

429
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:35,363
I'm probably only holding back 10% of each funding source

430
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,722
that is coming into play so that there's not a gift, right?

431
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:48,286
So it's, I hear the pickle that you're in and I can appreciate the pickle.

432
00:47:48,446 --> 00:47:50,507
I'm just trying to wrap my head around it.

433
00:47:51,007 --> 00:48:04,793
Again, you have an agreement that is supposed to be somewhat, somewhat has some teeth to it and change orders are still coming in and things are still happening and the punch lists that are here

434
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:08,828
is not all associated with a national grid.

435
00:48:09,408 --> 00:48:15,089
Therefore, I want, I, can you tell me why at least?

436
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:17,669
Go ahead.

437
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:34,352
To the chair, maybe since I think I heard earlier that we might not be voting on this tonight, maybe we should wait for full, full board anyway, and we, a little more time to review the documents, but maybe we can just make a list of what you want to see or what we want to see for that, for David and

438
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:44,756
to provide us before we take information, that they maybe have some time to gather and can get us a full picture.

439
00:48:45,877 --> 00:48:47,138
That sounds like a good thing.

440
00:48:47,178 --> 00:48:47,678
Thank you.

441
00:48:47,698 --> 00:48:56,905
Maybe each item, you'll be spending the $200,000 on itemized by amount, and then any other concerns.

442
00:48:56,945 --> 00:49:05,911
Yeah, and I was just thinking, like, more so, like, look, have you toyed with the idea, maybe not penalizing the full $500 per day,

443
00:49:07,228 --> 00:49:13,813
maybe there is a little bit something that you can do a penalty per day for some of the items.

444
00:49:13,873 --> 00:49:16,695
I'm just trying to think creatively as well as.

445
00:49:17,275 --> 00:49:22,258
No, that's a very useful suggestion.

446
00:49:22,278 --> 00:49:33,446
And my approach to this was going to be that we have to get our architects and Henry and

447
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:49,099
the, uh, and the contractor in a room together and, and, uh, you know, the contractor is as contractors do, they're trying to get as much as they can.

448
00:49:49,119 --> 00:50:04,842
And we are going to sit there with our, um, review of the, um, of the change orders and, and get them cut down to something we think is very reasonable.

449
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:21,334
and appropriate to what was done, and not just, you know, because this subcontractor handed a bill, then all of a sudden, you know, we owe it.

450
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:33,196
But also, we do have the liquid data damages, and that can be part of this discussion as well.

451
00:50:34,544 --> 00:50:48,667
But I think you would be wrong to go into that discussion with empty pockets, which puts us in a really bad position, frankly.

452
00:50:48,827 --> 00:50:55,408
So again, we're happy to work with you on this.

453
00:50:56,068 --> 00:50:59,089
We're happy to get you any information that you're looking for.

454
00:50:59,109 --> 00:51:01,730
And we can certainly provide you with a breakdown.

455
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:24,912
But until we've had the big powwow and sat down with everybody and closed the books on this thing, some of it is still subject to a little bit of variation here.

456
00:51:25,213 --> 00:51:27,715
And I would ask your indulgence in that.

457
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:35,384
You know, we can try to show you where the big cost drivers are, certainly.

458
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:43,791
But some of it is going to take some tough negotiation here.

459
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:48,014
Also, one more quick thing on liquidated damages.

460
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:55,580
I have a fairly good idea of how her attorney, who's an experienced construction attorney, is going to approach it.

461
00:51:56,884 --> 00:52:12,617
And he's going to obviously come at this from a perspective that we didn't have power, we didn't have the electrical, so that we really don't have a right to assess liquidated damages against him.

462
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:22,325
My feeling is that as soon as National Grid gets that electrical line hooked up, at that point, the $500 today does start immediately.

463
00:52:23,826 --> 00:52:25,047
I think prior to that,

464
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:29,501
It's going to be a bit of a negotiation in a perfect world.

465
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:43,134
We would have had our power on that property on June 15 and I would have been able to send a letter to her attorney on June 16 saying we are now enforcing the full teeth of the liquidated damages clause.

466
00:52:44,018 --> 00:53:03,093
their argument's going to be that we weren't ready for a lease up anyways because we don't have power, so that we don't, that liquidated damages has now become a penalty and not a reimbursement for actual damages.

467
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:12,621
I don't think he's gonna get tremendously far with it, but that is something I see them arguing, because the first thing anyone does with a liquidated damages clause is they always argue it's a penalty.

468
00:53:16,712 --> 00:53:28,499
So through the chair, can you, do you plan on, based on this meeting too, do you plan on maybe letting the developer know that once the national grid work is done, you're going to start instituting that penalty?

469
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:46,029
Because not only is that in your MOU, but also in contract, but also because the affordable housing you trust in Medford, is it interested in potentially helping with this project and is making that somewhat of a recommendation or if you need us to make it a requirement,

470
00:53:46,588 --> 00:53:51,951
Maybe use that as a little help to get a project done.

471
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,432
I think that does make sense.

472
00:53:54,592 --> 00:54:05,839
I mean, you know, one of the things I've tried to do with this contractor and her legal team is to work with them, but in a stern manner.

473
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:09,121
But certainly in this instance, yes, I can.

474
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:13,749
The day the power is connected, I can send that letter to them.

475
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:25,774
And I'm also going to let them know that, you know, we have heard from the Affordable Housing Trust that they want us to start enforcing this liquidated damages clause.

476
00:54:26,955 --> 00:54:28,996
The big thing for me, though.

477
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,717
Yeah, the big thing is.

478
00:54:30,837 --> 00:54:31,437
Go ahead.

479
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:34,759
I'll make a motion then.

480
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:57,177
we get an itemized breakdown of the $200,000, and they send a letter to the contractor within seven days, letting them know that we may be getting some funding from Affordable Housing Trust, but the trust is going to be requiring us to enforce the damage clause.

481
00:54:57,417 --> 00:55:02,861
So this is just forewarning that when National Grid is done, that punch list should also be done.

482
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:18,787
That does make good sense to me because at that point, once they have power, their argument that we're not suffering any damages because we couldn't lease up the property anyways is no longer valid.

483
00:55:19,808 --> 00:55:27,814
That's when any arguments that her legal team could have that it's a penalty rather than a reimbursement would be completely wiped out.

484
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:30,836
So I have no problem doing that.

485
00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:33,938
Yeah, hopefully she'll be done with her country.

486
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:34,619
So we'll get you a list.

487
00:55:35,827 --> 00:55:38,648
We'll get you a list that we're not really voting on.

488
00:55:38,688 --> 00:55:40,649
Today was more of a presentation.

489
00:55:40,949 --> 00:55:52,373
We'll get you a list of all of the items that we would like to have at the next meeting that you are coming and actually asking for funding.

490
00:55:53,053 --> 00:55:57,875
And I will give you a snapshot, an updated performa.

491
00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:22,041
showing the actual costs is going to be this is the performer that you gave us is um the original i want to see a updated one to the best of your ability okay well um that that we can start working on all right excellent did anybody else have any questions before we move on to the next item

492
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:27,861
do we need to talk about this list of items, or are we going to be doing that in a different part of a meeting?

493
00:56:28,742 --> 00:56:31,683
We can do that separately.

494
00:56:32,284 --> 00:56:36,046
We can each separately send Catherine a list of what we'd like to see.

495
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:38,928
But just don't CC everybody.

496
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:39,408
Everybody.

497
00:56:39,448 --> 00:56:39,628
Yeah.

498
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:40,649
OK.

499
00:56:41,089 --> 00:56:43,711
And then Catherine will get that list to you all.

500
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:44,451
Very good.

501
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:45,251
Very good.

502
00:56:45,772 --> 00:56:45,892
Yeah.

503
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,100
All right, excellent.

504
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,020
Well, thank you.

505
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,201
You are more than welcome to stay for the rest of our meeting.

506
00:56:52,281 --> 00:57:00,583
But if you want to go, thank you very much for joining us today, introducing the project.

507
00:57:04,904 --> 00:57:11,105
All right, well, thank you very much for hearing us today.

508
00:57:11,665 --> 00:57:16,146
And we'll be working very hard to get you everything you're looking for.

509
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,262
And it's been.

510
00:57:31,193 --> 00:57:32,154
Approval.

511
00:57:33,355 --> 00:57:35,216
All of the minute minute minute for.

512
00:57:59,997 --> 00:58:01,157
Hello.

513
00:58:01,217 --> 00:58:08,158
To review the minute meetings from May, June and July.

514
00:58:10,879 --> 00:58:13,919
Yes, a motion to approve.

515
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:15,240
Yeah.

516
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:20,004
Then we'll do a roll call.

517
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:23,366
All right, and then the next.

518
00:58:23,406 --> 00:58:27,049
Is the next round and there were no applications.

519
00:58:56,808 --> 00:59:05,312
All right, so the next item on the agenda is we're going back to item three.

520
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:10,074
There were no applications from the NOFA that we released earlier this year.

521
00:59:10,535 --> 00:59:22,320
The trust may discuss how to proceed with issuing future funding, including potential transition to accepting applications on a rolling basis throughout the year.

522
00:59:23,641 --> 00:59:25,682
Also, I did want to, I printed out,

523
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:30,348
information from legal counsel about the ability to do that.

524
00:59:30,388 --> 00:59:38,975
It sounds like that should not be an issue in terms of doing a ruling application, but just in case you wanted to review.

525
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:35,481
So we can transfer, transition from, although we did the RFP this time around, I think it was fairly good RFP because we had so little money and hopefully one day we will have a lot of money and developers can come.

526
01:00:36,602 --> 01:00:37,822
Just one question.

527
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:43,544
Was there any expressions of interest and just people couldn't make the deadline or was there really just no?

528
01:00:44,504 --> 01:00:45,504
No, I don't know.

529
01:00:46,044 --> 01:00:48,725
I wasn't involved when it was distributed, so I'm not

530
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:53,654
exactly how wide the audience was, but I think it's just because the trust is new.

531
01:00:54,434 --> 01:00:59,799
There's not as much recognition of that opportunity for funding or awareness.

532
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:04,122
So that's something that the board can keep in mind for future.

533
01:01:04,443 --> 01:01:15,892
Through the chair, do we have a sense, you know, I know on our NOFA we stated like how much money we have to apply for, if it's rolling, is there a way to kind of like

534
01:01:16,397 --> 01:01:17,478
Or would we even want to?

535
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:23,121
I'm just throwing out the idea that we wouldn't have a ticker of how much money we have available.

536
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:27,283
I'm just curious how folks think that part would work in terms of a rolling option.

537
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:42,252
So in my experience, it's once we start getting funding applications, we would ask the trust staff to do financials to show us what we have in our account, what we haven't committed.

538
01:01:43,208 --> 01:01:45,490
so we're not overextending ourselves.

539
01:01:45,971 --> 01:01:48,914
That's how I've seen it done in other ways.

540
01:01:48,994 --> 01:02:08,612
So, you know, and especially like developers, there's a lot of feedback that we got from the developers and when we did the stakeholder meetings, like being flexible in our application process, making sure that we're taking applications

541
01:02:09,219 --> 01:02:13,943
in a timely manner, so they can get their one-stop application for the state.

542
01:02:14,043 --> 01:02:29,818
I'm trying to actually trying to get the funding for the one-stop application and all their commitments.

543
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:35,583
And so, I mean, this doing it based on a role, I think may benefit

544
01:02:36,058 --> 01:02:39,380
the developers more so than doing another app RFP.

545
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,562
Can I ask one more question?

546
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,964
I guess I'm asking it out loud to all of us.

547
01:02:44,044 --> 01:02:46,906
I don't know if you have the answer.

548
01:02:48,407 --> 01:02:58,274
Would we want, would we set like a standard practice, like timeline for us of like, you get something in and then at the next meeting we discuss it and then at what time for just thinking of like,

549
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:01,056
for our own sake, kind of knowing that.

550
01:03:01,276 --> 01:03:08,958
And then also just if that's what we communicate out to developers, so they have a sense of like, if you get it in by now, it could be likely processed by us.

551
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:20,460
Like deadlines that says if we're meeting the first Wednesday of the month, if you want your application to come in and to be reviewed at the meeting, you need to have everything submitted by X date.

552
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,041
And that gives us time to review and stuff like that.

553
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:28,302
And then we would review it on like X or try to commit to like a certain process that we would follow.

554
01:03:28,342 --> 01:03:29,102
I don't know.

555
01:03:29,783 --> 01:03:35,845
I like deadlines a lot, so that, to me, seems like I would want that for us and to communicate out and to live with this.

556
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:51,351
Yeah, so I think just generally what I thought about the RFP process was that there'd be a somewhat standard process that would give the developers enough time to meet the standard EOHLC deadlines.

557
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:55,813
I mean, they don't change them by, you know, more than two or three months every year, right?

558
01:03:56,813 --> 01:03:58,774
On top of that, it would also maybe give us room

559
01:03:59,232 --> 01:04:01,312
have a standard kind of timeline throughout our year.

560
01:04:01,332 --> 01:04:12,155
So we're not constantly getting applications and also being able to assess the application sometimes, you know, in some way in competition with each other, this is a scarce resource.

561
01:04:12,875 --> 01:04:23,917
And if you give it to a very nice project at the beginning of the year, and you don't see the very nice project at the end of the year, I think having it all at once had a certain amount of appeal to me personally.

562
01:04:24,558 --> 01:04:26,258
But I do understand we were new.

563
01:04:26,845 --> 01:04:32,168
You know, I think we were very quick to try to get some things out, which is great, but I think, um.

564
01:04:32,188 --> 01:04:37,870
Uh, yeah, we should try to assess how we want the regular schedule to be.

565
01:04:38,571 --> 01:04:40,451
And then if there's going to be 1 off things, maybe.

566
01:04:41,632 --> 01:04:44,513
And do it on 1 off basis here and there.

567
01:04:44,994 --> 01:04:49,556
Yeah, no, I agree, especially with the limited amount of funding that we had this time.

568
01:04:49,616 --> 01:04:50,256
It was a fair.

569
01:04:50,296 --> 01:04:50,616
In the, uh.

570
01:04:54,902 --> 01:04:59,005
making sure that all the stakeholders have the ability to do it.

571
01:04:59,366 --> 01:05:04,150
I mean, we can continue the conversation when we have more trustees here.

572
01:05:04,270 --> 01:05:05,090
Yeah.

573
01:05:05,931 --> 01:05:15,279
Maybe that's a good idea, too, through the chair, because it seems like we've got no... Exactly.

574
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:23,625
The whole board can decide what to do with the 150 more and how much we can add to it.

575
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:32,014
just to kind of go off of the mayor's, this application didn't come in within the deadline of our RFP.

576
01:05:32,074 --> 01:05:37,958
So if we're doing, this is why we're thinking about sort of broadening it out.

577
01:05:38,038 --> 01:05:43,862
And it's not a complete, I mean, today wasn't an application, today was a presentation.

578
01:05:43,882 --> 01:05:44,262
Right.

579
01:05:44,302 --> 01:05:45,362
An informal presentation.

580
01:05:45,382 --> 01:05:46,963
A very informal presentation.

581
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:49,465
But we can continue the conversation.

582
01:05:50,723 --> 01:05:53,705
We have August, remind me, August 27th?

583
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:56,146
Yes, the last Wednesday of August.

584
01:05:56,707 --> 01:06:02,990
And then also September 3rd, the next Wednesday is the annual meeting.

585
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:10,875
And just as a reminder, the August 27th, the vision behind that was that

586
01:06:11,498 --> 01:06:19,681
this meeting we would review applications, should any have come in, and then the 27th we could invite people to come in to discuss.

587
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:24,603
So that aspect is not relevant.

588
01:06:24,943 --> 01:06:32,866
So through the chair, will the 8th, 27th be canceled because no applications came in, so we only have to meet once that week?

589
01:06:34,986 --> 01:06:36,387
I got the impression

590
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:53,694
that these folks here, Medford Community Housing, is looking for a commitment from the trust sooner rather than later.

591
01:06:53,754 --> 01:07:05,297
That was my perception of what the conversation was, but it will depend on whether or not they're able to get a completed application in on whether or not

592
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:07,820
whether one of you can make a difference to them.

593
01:07:09,221 --> 01:07:11,702
I don't know.

594
01:07:12,122 --> 01:07:20,086
Maybe you can, when you send them the list of items, ask whether or not they can wait until the September meeting.

595
01:07:20,106 --> 01:07:22,368
Yeah, I'm happy to do that.

596
01:07:22,808 --> 01:07:33,554
I will also just note that we have, in addition, I don't know how long we want to go, but discussion of the community meeting and input for the action plan.

597
01:07:33,574 --> 01:07:35,635
So that's just another topic

598
01:07:36,534 --> 01:07:40,177
keep in mind that would require discussion as something.

599
01:07:40,377 --> 01:07:40,678
Right.

600
01:07:40,738 --> 01:07:57,452
And I think maybe we can table that discussion if everybody is open to tabling the discussion of the community meeting to September, maybe the 27th or September whenever to another meeting.

601
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:03,878
I'm suggesting this only because the three trustee, like we were here,

602
01:08:04,496 --> 01:08:14,585
I don't know Mayor, were you able to be on the, it was, I think you may have had a conflict at the Poet Laureate Ceremony.

603
01:08:14,765 --> 01:08:15,205
Yes.

604
01:08:15,946 --> 01:08:22,852
And to be able to present it to all the trustees when we're all here, does that suit?

605
01:08:23,092 --> 01:08:25,394
Are you open to table number three, five?

606
01:08:28,141 --> 01:08:39,773
I think 6 or 5, 6, so we'll continue the conversation on table on on 3, a motion to table by.

607
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:43,820
and six.

608
01:08:44,021 --> 01:08:51,706
Okay, I'll make that motion to table through five and six until at least the 27th of August or the 3rd of September, depending on when we meet next.

609
01:08:52,206 --> 01:08:52,426
Okay.

610
01:08:52,647 --> 01:08:53,087
Thank you, Chair.

611
01:08:53,107 --> 01:08:54,228
Can I ask a question?

612
01:08:54,388 --> 01:09:03,954
Do we have a set date that we're presenting the action plan at the City Council or is the date of that discussion impacts when that is?

613
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:07,677
I'm just trying to make sure we're not like spacing everything out.

614
01:09:07,737 --> 01:09:11,700
There is no date necessarily yet.

615
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:11,880
Okay.

616
01:09:12,246 --> 01:09:16,491
They don't meet next until the 9th of September for their regular meeting.

617
01:09:16,511 --> 01:09:22,278
We'll have 2 meetings in September and then we'll start 2 meetings after that every month.

618
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:24,120
I would second the motion.

619
01:09:32,175 --> 01:09:34,856
No, no, no, that was me saying I, I'm sorry.

620
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:35,476
I'm sorry.

621
01:09:35,496 --> 01:09:40,418
We're doing a quick little roll call because we are not all in person.

622
01:09:40,658 --> 01:09:42,439
Actually, we are in person.

623
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,359
Please do a roll call.

624
01:09:44,699 --> 01:09:46,580
Okay.

625
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:47,820
Everybody.

626
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:47,900
Aye.

627
01:09:48,561 --> 01:09:48,661
Aye.

628
01:09:48,881 --> 01:09:49,021
Aye.

629
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:49,481
Aye.

630
01:09:49,621 --> 01:09:50,101
Perfect.

631
01:09:50,221 --> 01:09:50,761
Thank you.

632
01:09:50,781 --> 01:09:54,203
All right, so we did that.

633
01:09:54,263 --> 01:10:01,345
Then meeting schedule item number one, I'm going to pass on Catherine.

634
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:04,311
Um, yeah, so I've actually covered this.

635
01:10:04,451 --> 01:10:07,151
We have the August 27th and September 3rd.

636
01:10:07,932 --> 01:10:12,473
Um, so just, uh, if we wanted to keep those, that's basically the discussion.

637
01:10:12,493 --> 01:10:22,416
And then also I wanted to highlight that the Community Preservation Committee invited.

638
01:10:22,596 --> 01:10:31,038
We want to have some coordination or collaboration with them in terms of how to receive

639
01:10:31,957 --> 01:10:36,362
Housing related requests.

640
01:10:36,463 --> 01:10:38,104
September 9th, a Wednesday.

641
01:10:38,124 --> 01:10:40,067
It's a Tuesday Tuesday.

642
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,747
It's a Tuesday.

643
01:10:40,767 --> 01:10:40,848
Okay.

644
01:10:45,092 --> 01:10:48,416
And we can add that back to our next meeting as well.

645
01:10:48,476 --> 01:10:51,500
Just so we have more trustees.

646
01:12:30,021 --> 01:12:32,403
Sorry about that guys, we are back.

647
01:12:32,543 --> 01:12:43,273
Alright, so we are now moving on to item number 8, Board of Trustees Vacancies Appointments Updates.

648
01:12:43,774 --> 01:12:47,237
Yeah, I was just going to let people know that we did have some applications.

649
01:12:47,657 --> 01:12:52,482
I sent along a couple of potential recommendations and

650
01:12:53,312 --> 01:12:56,474
And that's where we are, so I wanted to show that we did have interest.

651
01:12:56,755 --> 01:12:58,396
So we have to make a decision.

652
01:12:58,736 --> 01:13:00,778
Yeah, I think I remember one name.

653
01:13:00,998 --> 01:13:06,782
So I've reviewed all the names and my office will make that appointment this week.

654
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:08,123
OK, great.

655
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:10,345
And we'll be full again.

656
01:13:10,365 --> 01:13:11,886
All right.

657
01:13:12,066 --> 01:13:14,828
And then the Board of Trustees elected positions

658
01:13:16,265 --> 01:13:17,827
just putting it out there.

659
01:13:17,967 --> 01:13:27,557
According to the Declaration of Trust, trustees shall annually elect officials consistent of the chair, vice chair, and treasurer.

660
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:34,184
These positions will be voted on at the September 3rd annual meeting, our first annual meeting.

661
01:13:34,204 --> 01:13:36,326
Are we going to have cake?

662
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:49,474
There's no official guidance about the duties of the associated roles with each role provided with the declaration under the declaration.

663
01:13:50,215 --> 01:13:53,116
But I wanted to put it out there like there's there's three roles.

664
01:13:53,176 --> 01:13:56,138
Again, the chair, the vice chair and the treasurer.

665
01:13:56,158 --> 01:13:57,738
I am the chair.

666
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:03,261
The duties that revolve around the chair is facilitating this meeting.

667
01:14:04,354 --> 01:14:27,279
meeting with staff and usually once a month pre just to prepare for the for the meeting go over the agenda um and the vice chair is patley penny you want to just do a quick little yeah uh i my main responsibility is facilitating when the chair either cannot or asks me to yeah and uh moral support i guess

668
01:14:29,888 --> 01:14:32,731
And then I'm both interested in continuing.

669
01:14:32,971 --> 01:14:33,271
Yeah.

670
01:14:33,371 --> 01:14:39,095
Just so we can know for the I was going to say that, like, I'm happy to continue on as the chair.

671
01:14:39,196 --> 01:14:45,000
But I also know that maybe somebody else wants to wants to do the chair.

672
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:55,088
So I'm like, you're open, but nobody's nobody toes will be stepped on if anybody expressed interest on on becoming on running for the chair.

673
01:14:56,229 --> 01:14:58,030
The treasurer is Kerry.

674
01:14:58,090 --> 01:14:59,071
Kerry's not here.

675
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:01,170
We don't have any money.

676
01:15:03,631 --> 01:15:11,113
But eventually, I would imagine that the treasurer will be working very closely with the staff once we do start getting money.

677
01:15:11,393 --> 01:15:12,433
We do have money, sorry.

678
01:15:12,473 --> 01:15:17,855
We have $300,000, and we may be giving out some money soon, but we'll be working together to make sure.

679
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:20,676
Isn't there enough funding in there?

680
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:20,676
$350,000.

681
01:15:20,836 --> 01:15:21,576
$350,000.

682
01:15:20,936 --> 01:15:21,576
I'm sorry.

683
01:15:21,596 --> 01:15:22,056
Yes.

684
01:15:22,256 --> 01:15:22,776
Thank you.

685
01:15:22,796 --> 01:15:23,336
I'm not sure.

686
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:32,365
Um, so we'll be voting on those.

687
01:15:32,385 --> 01:15:34,846
That's that's in September.

688
01:15:34,866 --> 01:15:36,707
Not that next meeting in September.

689
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:39,968
So if you are interested in running, please let Catherine know.

690
01:15:40,068 --> 01:15:40,608
So meetings.

691
01:15:42,169 --> 01:15:46,550
Um, and we have hit the end of the meeting.

692
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:50,011
Does anybody want to make a motion?

693
01:15:50,472 --> 01:15:53,813
Or does anybody have any questions or comments before we make any motions?

694
01:15:56,034 --> 01:15:58,615
I'll just maybe get the, um.

695
01:16:00,357 --> 01:16:06,980
comments on what you want the developer or Metro Housing, Community Housing to provide us by the end of next week maybe.

696
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:08,201
Oh that's so perfect.

697
01:16:08,461 --> 01:16:09,562
I definitely.

698
01:16:09,582 --> 01:16:14,244
That gives everybody a little time to review the documents.

699
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:17,886
So the 22nd just in case we meet with them on the 27th.

700
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:18,806
Thank you.

701
01:16:18,826 --> 01:16:20,407
That is perfect.

702
01:16:20,427 --> 01:16:22,208
So everybody will give a cap.

703
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:24,509
I think Catherine when you send out an email to

704
01:16:25,096 --> 01:16:35,718
to the trustees, can you just let them know after reviewing the documents if there's any other documentation that they want to see with an application that would be fabulous?

705
01:16:36,098 --> 01:16:36,378
Yes.

706
01:16:36,918 --> 01:16:37,198
All right.

707
01:16:37,358 --> 01:16:37,778
Thanks.

708
01:16:38,778 --> 01:16:39,019
All right.

709
01:16:39,379 --> 01:16:40,339
Do we want a motion to adjourn?

710
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:40,419
Yay.

711
01:16:40,439 --> 01:16:40,559
