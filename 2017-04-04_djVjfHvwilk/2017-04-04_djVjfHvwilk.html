    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1532.406s">Mr.</a>  President, members of the Council, good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1534.786s">I'm</a>  here tonight with Dr. Heidi Riccio, the Principal Director of the Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1540.137s">vocational</a>  technical school, and she's going to go into some detail for you with regard to this particular capital skills program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1549.684s">The</a>  money was awarded by the governor recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1552.466s">Contract</a>  was just signed the end of March. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1555.709s">And</a>  there is going to be approximately $1.3 million of altogether between the state grant and in-kind contributions from various vendors and others. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1567.632s">of</a>  their money, but we need a $250,000 capital match to advance our culinary arts and hospitality program and our advanced manufacturing program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1578.441s">If</a>  you go up the technical school now, you'll see that the old print shop is now being deconstructed and being made into a first-class hospitality and restaurant center, and you're also going to see the advance of the advanced manufacturing activity going on with robotics and engineering going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1596.898s">things</a>  that were never really considered likely in a vocational technical school years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1603.342s">Dr.</a>  Riccio has done a terrific job putting all this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1606.384s">We're</a>  very pleased that the governor saw his way to give us a half million dollars, and I'm going to let her go into details. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1614.61s">You</a>  have some materials that we've given you previously, but also tonight she's added some supplementals that she can discuss with you so that you have an idea of what we're investing in. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1625.493s">Uh,</a>  we think this is a terrific project. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1628.094s">It's</a>  going to, uh, advance our activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1631.136s">Technically.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1631.676s">It's</a>  also going to help us partner with some very significant area individuals and corporations. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1638.16s">And</a>  we think it's one of the best things we've ever done. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1641.081s">So</a>  I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Richie.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1643.122s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Belson.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1646.064s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Belson, city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1650.246s">I</a>  have given you two packets of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1653.387s">The</a>  first is the, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1655.695s">both</a>  were submitted as part of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1658.736s">The</a>  first is the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1661.617s">And</a>  what we looked at with this capital skills grant that came out through the governor's office, I'm sure you have all been well aware of what vocational education is in Massachusetts, particularly since the Governor Baker has come in and has allotted over $35 million in the next three to five years for specific vocational technical expansion. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1685.049s">In</a>  Medford, over the last three years, we have increased our programs from 11 to 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1693.012s">We</a>  have also eliminated pretty much the out-of-district tuition that we are paying out of Medford and two out-of-district placements as a result of these new programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1705.516s">Culinary</a>  arts and hospitality is the third largest industry in the world, second only to the healthcare operations and government agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1714.723s">We</a>  also have Winn-Everett or Winn-Boston Harbor coming in that will employ up to 4,000 hospitality workers, not including the addition of a Marriott corporate hotel chain here, which is a boutique hotel that opened just last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1730.086s">Another</a>  hotel and conference center that is opening up in Medford, including the hotel that already exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1738.268s">lots</a>  of different area restaurants, but in addition to that, being so closely situated to Boston, which is the largest convention center in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1749.592s">Because</a>  of this, we see a significant need to increase our opportunities for our students and make sure that they're prepared for the future workforce, not just the existing workforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1760.156s">The</a>  current space was built in the mid-1990s out of a first floor cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1765.598s">The</a>  space was divided up and sectioned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1769.1s">There</a>  is no window space available. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1771.842s">There</a>  is no easy access to the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1775.985s">There</a>  is outdated equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1778.687s">The</a>  tile is not appropriate for the kitchen of today, as well as the dining room. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1785.231s">The</a>  new space was written as a direct result of what those needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1789.898s">The</a>  space was selected as graphic communications because it sits on an outside area or quadrant of the vocational high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1797.964s">This</a>  means that there'll be easy access from the outside public coming into the vocational school to dine and have their meetings at our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1807.751s">There'll</a>  be no access to the rest of the building because the entrance will be directly from the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1814.652s">As</a>  a result, we have applied for the $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1818.894s">Last</a>  year, we did not get awarded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1821.895s">We</a>  felt that it was important to go back to the governor and seek why. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1826.136s">One</a>  of the reasons is that we did not have enough or strong enough partnership or in-kind donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1833.039s">So</a>  as a result, we spent the last 10 months investigating who we can partner with. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1839.662s">The</a>  partners are situated in that two-page document that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1845.113s">We</a>  are also looking at advanced manufacturing, and I believe February of last year, it was the city council that actually recommended, which I did receive a letter from Councilman Marks, to investigate advanced manufacturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1860.198s">As</a>  a result, we felt that there was a need to increase our opportunities for our robotics and engineering students and increase advanced manufacturing opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1870.043s">Therefore,</a>  there's approximately $89,000 of this grant application that was strictly and solely for advanced manufacturing equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1880.067s">If</a>  you see on the second page, and it has all of our partnerships, I can certainly explain the partnerships between InKind and CashValue, if you would like. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1893.475s">In</a>  kind with Bunker Community College is the dual enrollment potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1897.237s">So</a>  we took the average cost of what a three credit course is, multiplied it by the number of students that potentially could take these dual enrollment courses, and that's how we were able to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1909.301s">That's</a>  a little bit different than articulated credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1912.403s">Articulated</a>  credit is credit that students receive at the vocational high school just by being part of that program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1919.826s">For</a>  example, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1921.83s">Culinary</a>  Arts and Hospitality has a state-articulated agreement with every community college in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1929.178s">Therefore,</a>  as a result of taking their high school program at the vocational school, they have an option provided they meet the criteria of a B or better to earn college credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1940.159s">That</a>  is the same in the engineering program as well as the robotics program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1944.981s">So</a>  that articulated credit is a cost savings to the number of students that have the potential to earn college credit just by coming to the vocational high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1955.027s">When</a>  Boston Harbor, which I did include each of these in-kind and cash donations in the second packet has a letter of support as well as what those donations or in-kind services are. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1969.296s">Wynn</a>  Boston Harbor, over the next five years, has committed to $525,000 worth of in-kind donations. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1978.189s">What</a>  that means is that Wynn Boston Harbor, because it is considered a luxury resort property, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1984.893s">They</a>  change out their equipment and services and linen every three years in order to make sure that they're providing exceptional service to their guests. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=1996.358s">We</a>  will become a direct benefactor of any of the outdated equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2001.52s">It's</a>  not outdated by anybody else's standards but when, as a result of the type of program and offerings that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2009.897s">We</a>  will also have monthly guest lecture series programs for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2015.682s">What</a>  that means is the executive chefs, sous chefs from the Wynn Boston Harbor will guest lecture to the high school students at the vocational high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2027.131s">In</a>  addition to that, they have guaranteed internships and cooperative education services or opportunities for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2036.819s">The</a>  Labor's Local 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2039.691s">has</a>  donated the materials that it will cost in order to build the ADA-compliant ramp that will be the main entrance area of our vocational school, which is at a cost savings to the district of $50,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2055.587s">Microsoft</a>  Corporation, we have three software engineers, two of which work for Microsoft Corporation. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2063.89s">When</a>  companies like Microsoft donate their time or their services to a school district, they can award financial equivalent to the hours of what they donate to a particular school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2077.493s">Those</a>  software engineers have awarded Medford Vocational Technical High School their equal salary pay for each hour that they donate to Medford Vocational School, which is five days per week, five hours per week. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2093.616s">iRobot</a>  donated a robot that the students are able to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2100.7s">And</a>  Medford Public Schools, this is the in-kind of $75,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2105.782s">We</a>  believe that our students in the construction fields, meaning carpentry, construction and craft laborers, electrical, HVAC and refrigeration, and metal fabrication <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2116.236s">should</a>  receive authentic learning experiences alongside the tradesmen that we will be hiring in order to complete this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2123.623s">As</a>  a result, we specifically put in our quotes that they have to be willing to work alongside our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2132.416s">We</a>  believe that our students will receive authentic work. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2135.397s">If</a>  you have been following us on Facebook or in the blog that Lisa Evangelista has, there are several pictures of our kids directly involved in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2146.28s">So</a>  we value that at a cost savings to the district or to the city of $75,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2153.422s">We</a>  are also, through Bunker Hill Community College, we have engaged in a partnership through the Northeast Advanced Manufacturing Consortium, in which $48,000 is being given to the district in order to run this program and to pay for certain costs and materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2171.728s">The</a>  second packet that you have is labor statistics that validates the reason why we selected culinary arts and hospitality, as well as the advanced manufacturing fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2182.914s">This</a>  can all be found on the Massachusetts Labor Statistics website. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2188.156s">The</a>  letters of support, as well as the plan in moving forward and the equipment that we had submitted for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2196.012s">We</a>  also have a letter from state representatives, as well as the mayor of Everett and the mayor of Medford, forging a partnership between the two schools for offering vocational courses or programs to students from Medford and Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2218.81s">So</a>  at this time, if you have questions for me or... You sure?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2223.634s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2225.906s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2227.147s">So,</a>  a few years back, as a member of the school committee, myself and Mr. Falco, I don't think we ever dreamed that the vision that, the reality that we are in today, and the vision that you've led us with, Dr. Riccio, is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2248.357s">The</a>  thought process in my mind back then was trying to boost <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2254.014s">the</a>  programs that we had in place, the automotive, the electrical, the other wonderful programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2261.197s">But</a>  what you've done here now, the leadership programs, the partnerships with different businesses, communities, and unions, the collaborations with all the stakeholders, the alumni involvement, the thousands of dollars that we're saving, keeping our kids in our community, and the money that we were losing <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2283.568s">at</a>  that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2285.71s">The</a>  sense of pride that I feel for what you're trying to do and what you are accomplishing is immense. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2294.197s">And</a>  you can feel it throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2297.159s">Again,</a>  I had two more phone calls today from parents asking me how can I get in touch with the vocational school where kids were not in vocational education. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2307.207s">They</a>  were in private schools and wanted to come back to Medford and wanting to <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2313.343s">participate</a>  in the vocational experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2315.704s">So</a>  as this program, as this request comes in front of us, I just see it as a continued commitment that I made back then to try to focus on helping the vocational school be the jewel that it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2334.314s">And</a>  with your leadership and the superintendent's leadership, I think we've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2338.656s">I</a>  think this is just an amazing program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2342.124s">I</a>  see the benefits in the community that I work in. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2347.087s">Not</a>  to knock them, but they have one wonderful program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2350.189s">And</a>  they boast on that one wonderful program, and that program is the culinary arts program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2356.253s">And</a>  what that program does for that community's senior citizens and residents, that they can just walk across the street and take the senior bus to the vocational school and purchase and have a <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2371.977s">four</a>  course meal that normally they can't afford and to come into that culinary art setting and celebrate that and knowing that this is now going to be a reality in Medford and seeing the construction that's being done there and the access that the community will have there is second to none. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2392.992s">And</a>  as I told the director this week that <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2398.16s">the</a>  only one piece of jewelry that they had on us is now going to go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2403.341s">And</a>  we're now taking over everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2405.642s">And</a>  so again, when you're talking about money well spent, I think this community, and with your efforts, and the way you've spelt it out for us, only shows and reinforces how, not just financially, but prideful enthusiasm that we're getting back tenfold. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2428.255s">from</a>  our investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2429.236s">So</a>  I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2430.597s">I</a>  commend you. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2431.598s">And,</a>  um, and I don't care what anybody says. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2434.24s">Uh,</a>  no one has thanked me for bringing you to, to, to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2437.923s">I</a>  think it was me personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2439.124s">I</a>  drove all the way to your home and brought you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2442.387s">So,</a>  um, that really didn't happen, but I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2446.11s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2447.251s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2447.592s">Councilor</a>  Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2448.472s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2449.714s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2450.614s">And</a>  I want to thank, uh, Mr. Bellson and Dr. Riccio for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2454.396s">Um,</a>  I am very, very excited to hear this news. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2457.217s">Um,</a>  with regard to the grant, um, you know, uh, constant Scarpelli hit it on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2462.639s">Uh,</a>  when we were on the school committee, we used to, you know, we had the folk and, you know, you know, and I was, I was always at the mentality of, you know, we've had vocational education in this city for over 80 years and we, you know, we should embrace it and we should, you know, give it the funding that it needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2480.565s">And</a>  if we give it the right amount of funding, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2482.522s">it's</a>  going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2483.542s">And</a>  I think we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2484.842s">But</a>  one of the key components was hiring you. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2488.663s">And</a>  I mean it when I say that, because I tell people this. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2493.424s">When</a>  we were on the school committee, we hired almost every single principal in the district, because principals were coming and going. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2502.726s">And</a>  I thought that, honestly, I look today at everyone that we hired, and I think you were one of our best hires. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2510.168s">And</a>  I mean that, because since you've come in, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2512.781s">You</a>  know, you've really built the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2516.683s">You</a>  know, when you say you've gone from 11 to 20 programs, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any other school district that has done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2525.326s">When</a>  we talk about, you know, out-of-district tuition, the reduction, almost the elimination of out-of-district tuition, kids going to Minuteman, I mean, when we used to have budget time, we used to look at that number and it was just mind-boggling. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2541.547s">I</a>  think it was up at around a half a million dollars at one point.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2543.968s">One</a>  million.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2544.488s">More</a>  than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2544.948s">Okay,</a>  yeah, one million, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2547.629s">So</a>  one million dollars, and we've reduced that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2550.51s">So</a>  that's a significant reduction, and those dollars are coming back, and they're in our school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2557.333s">And</a>  I mean, the partnerships that you've built, the vision that you had, it's just been amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2562.975s">And</a>  you haven't even been in the district that long, so you've had quite an impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2568.096s">And</a>  you know, everybody I talk to, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2570.447s">You</a>  know, vocational, you know, technical, method technical school, I mean, really, vocational education is the rage right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2580.151s">I</a>  mean, a lot of kids want to go to the voc, go to method technical school. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2584.352s">And,</a>  you know, the way I look at it is it's the best of both worlds, because you can learn a trade and you can go to college if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2592.095s">And</a>  I think those are valuable tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2594.256s">And</a>  to come here with this news tonight, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2598.77s">To</a>  see that all the partnerships that you've formed and the in-kind donations that are coming in, it's just remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2606.513s">This</a>  is something that I support 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2608.333s">And</a>  I think that, you know, the other thing you're trying to do is you're trying to build the alumni network, which I think is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2619.537s">And</a>  you have, and I'm going to plug. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2621.777s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2622.578s">You</a>  have an event coming up.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2624.868s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2625.609s">Well,</a>  not I, because it's the Alumni Association, but musical bingo. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2630.052s">So</a>  it's $25, April 13th, 7 to 11 at the Irish American Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2639.599s">And</a>  the prizes are pretty phenomenal, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2642.381s">We</a>  have the Sheridan Boston, and I don't know if you know the hotel industry, but April <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2648.642s">in</a>  Boston on a Saturday night is extremely difficult to even get a hotel room, let alone get one for free. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2654.886s">So</a>  we were able to get the Red Sox Saturday, I think it's April 27th, with an overnight to the Sheraton Hotel as one of the prizes. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2664.753s">We</a>  have probably about four or five different sets of Red Sox tickets and hotel reservations. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2672.138s">We</a>  have <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2672.878s">been</a>  nothing but generous, and we've had a tremendous amount of graduates that have donated. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2679.181s">We</a>  have, I know you're going to kill me because you have your Red Sox hat on, but whoever the Cy Young award winner was last year, we have, Cy? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2692.148s">I</a>  said it right, Cy?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2693.189s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2696.07s">So,</a>  whatever, I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2698.852s">But</a>  anyway, we have his baseball. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2701.734s">Okay,</a>  so we have a lot of fabulous prizes that are out there, but the biggest thing with the Alumni Association is that we didn't have a formalized association. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2713.283s">And</a>  we know in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2715.542s">Because</a>  we have had vocational education long before any regional vocational school district since 1932. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2722.227s">So</a>  we're coming up to our 90th. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2725.99s">And</a>  as a result, we need to recognize that alumni. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2729.473s">Because</a>  often the alumni go, well, how can I help? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2732.873s">Well,</a>  this is one of the ways to help, is to join the Alumni Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2736.997s">All</a>  funds will be given to students alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2740.62s">So</a>  scholarship funds to defray the cost of tools, because as you know, if you are in auto tech, you do not get a job unless you already have your set of tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2752.25s">So</a>  we want to be able to provide each graduate with a set of entry level tools for whatever program they're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2759.965s">And</a>  that's what the Alumni Association is really raising funds for. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2764.107s">It's</a>  not for all of us to have a party. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2766.367s">It's</a>  to directly benefit the students of the vocational school as they enter their field of study or college, whichever they prefer.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2773.89s">So</a>  before Heidi goes on a little bit, tonight she came down, she left school, left 200 members of the advisory committees, all 20, 10 per advisory committee up there, working on <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2787.987s">doing</a>  additional contributions and the like.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2789.888s">How</a>  many people are up there now? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2791.109s">200</a>  plus? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2791.229s">There</a>  are about 220. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2791.949s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2793.43s">It's</a>  incredible up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2794.35s">They're</a>  working up there, developing all kinds of ways to assist the school moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2799.553s">It's</a>  incredible. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2801.294s">It's</a>  absolutely incredible.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2803.455s">Hardest</a>  part is I had to trust everyone to do the job, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2806.737s">And</a>  so clearly, I trust them. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2808.538s">I</a>  can leave, because they're good.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2811.379s">No,</a>  we have a- No, meaning leave tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2813.44s">We</a>  have a bracelet on us.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2817.433s">If</a>  I may, I just wanted to just finish up, I guess, by saying, you know, I really admire the fact that, you know, you never gave up on the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2826.517s">And</a>  when we turned down, I think it was last year, and you went back and said, why? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2830.499s">I</a>  mean, that tells, you know, everyone here a lot about you and about, you know, how you work. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2836.201s">And</a>  it's like, I like how you have that, you know, never give up, you know, optimism. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2841.003s">And,</a>  you know, we need to push ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2842.324s">We</a>  need to try harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2843.264s">We</a>  need to see what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2844.825s">If</a>  we don't get it this year, let's see if we can get it next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2847.471s">And</a>  I think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2849.392s">And</a>  I support this 100% and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2855.297s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2856.698s">Councilor</a>  Longo-Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2857.819s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2860.08s">Thank</a>  you for the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2862.002s">My</a>  first question was going to be the design, but it looks like we all got it in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2866.545s">I'm</a>  sure all the other councilors have seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2869.287s">We</a>  got this in the packet tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2870.428s">It</a>  looks very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2872.069s">Both</a>  drawings are in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2874.211s">One</a>  question I have, maybe you could just elaborate, I know it was discussed <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2877.437s">a</a>  couple weeks ago, Mr. Superintendent, but maybe you can elaborate with regards to, it was just said a million dollars was being spent on out of district, which I believe was Minuteman, but maybe you can just go over those figures for people out there that are saying, why the 250,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2891.623s">Do</a>  we have, you know?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2894.025s">So</a>  what you have is you have a situation in which if a school district does not have a particular vocational program, a student from our community could opt to go to a regional vocational school, which has the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2906.837s">Now,</a>  the program that has absorbed most of our youngsters who have gone out of the district is Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2912.221s">And</a>  there's some to Essex Aggie and places like that for agricultural programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2915.964s">But</a>  Minuteman has been the main thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2918.426s">And</a>  there was as many as 50 youngsters out there a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2922.369s">And</a>  given their tuition rates and the like, with special ed assessments on top of it, we're pushing $1 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2931.196s">Next</a>  year, we'll have, what, eight people out? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2933.878s">We</a>  have eight people out, and the year after, there'll be zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2936.795s">There</a>  were no applications that came in from Minuteman this year because we have programs that can't touch our young people because we have the programs in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2944.86s">In</a>  addition to that, with the expansion of what we're doing and working with Everett and some other communities that need a vocational program, we're actually going to be bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2960.41s">So</a>  the turnaround in a short period of time could be close to $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2965.365s">And</a>  that goes back to reinvesting in a school, because when we talk about technical education, you have to reinvest all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2972.25s">And</a>  you can't just simply say, well, the equipment is there, and it's going to be there for the next 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2977.154s">It's</a>  not like bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2978.916s">It's</a>  got to be the state of the art. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2981.117s">And</a>  we've got to be able to reinvest on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2985.18s">And</a>  that's going to give us that capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2986.882s">It's</a>  going to give us that capacity to hire people who have a great deal of experience, rather than people who are starting out in careers. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2993.967s">And</a>  that's going to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2995.716s">the</a>  entire way we look at the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=2999.017s">So</a>  I think that sort of, I hope that answers your question. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3001.498s">If</a>  you need more, I can tell you more.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3002.798s">Just</a>  the AP. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3003.619s">So</a>  1 million, we spent a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3005.519s">I</a>  remember that during budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3007.06s">And</a>  then what will the eight, just bringing that number of 40 or 50 students out to eight, what was, what's the cost difference there?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3015.142s">Well,</a>  the cost difference at eight students, probably a couple hundred thousand dollars, the most 150, you know, thousand dollars down from that in a year from now, that'll be gone altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3025.634s">The</a>  other thing that's probably very significant is that Minuteman is looking to rebuild its facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3033.337s">They</a>  want to build a 628-pupil facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3036.658s">They</a>  don't have 628 pupils to put in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3039.559s">So</a>  as a result, the cost of that is going to be absorbed by the remaining towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3043.241s">There</a>  were 16 communities that were in the Minuteman district. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3046.842s">There</a>  are now nine, as seven communities opted to leave because they didn't want to be part of the capital plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3054.53s">that</a>  Minuteman was going to assess. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3056.671s">We're</a>  going to guess that some community is going to pay $40,000, $50,000 per pupil to go to Minuteman, because there's going to be a capital charge to go there. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3066.315s">And</a>  we think it's not a very workable kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3068.896s">I</a>  think the state's going to have to intervene. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3070.276s">But</a>  in the short term, we're out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3073.357s">We're</a>  gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3074.158s">Because</a>  they were going to get the ability to assess a capital fee on top of the tuition fee, which could have been $10,000 on top of the tuition, which would have gone up to over $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3083.407s">$35,000</a>  per kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3086.788s">Unrealistic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3087.809s">We</a>  got ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3088.749s">We</a>  saw it coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3089.589s">That's</a>  why we were pushing back on the Minuteman issues a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3093.811s">And</a>  we're also saving transportation, because we won't be sending youngsters there. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3098.033s">It's</a>  another $65,000 to $75,000 a year in transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3101.434s">So</a>  a lot of positives in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3103.775s">And</a>  then, of course, the evening school programs that Dr. Riccio has started, bringing people in from the community to learn trades and other things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3110.877s">That's</a>  going to be another major thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3112.783s">for</a>  not only revenue, but also to give our people a chance to gain the skills they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3119.485s">You</a>  know, one of the discussions about jobs and creating jobs is giving people skill training, because you can't necessarily protect an industry which is no longer viable in this country by just simply saying, let's hope it comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3132.27s">You</a>  have to give people skill training so they can move on to the next industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3136.031s">And</a>  another thing that she's done, which I think is particularly significant, she's clustered and created programs so that you're cross-trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3142.823s">So</a>  if you're an HVAC in some of these other areas, you're learning multiple skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3146.685s">So</a>  if one industry goes south, you've got capacity to move to other industries. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3151.387s">And</a>  that's exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3153.508s">Not</a>  only is hospitality, you know, it's the restaurant, but it's the back of the house, it's the front of the house, it's all the maintenance of the house that goes with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3163.393s">So</a>  it's a major, major industry that produces all kinds of jobs and allows people to move across the lines as they cross trains.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3174.424s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3175.104s">So</a>  on that, just in 2018-19 is when we expect zero teenagers to go outside a district, and that's when we'll be able to opt out before the capital assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3186.209s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3186.629s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3188.089s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3188.99s">And</a>  then with regards to a time frame, if you do get, obviously, this money, and I believe you said it was 1.3 in total, what's the time frame for the build out and grand opening?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3201.534s">You</a>  want to tell them? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3203.135s">get</a>  ready, put your roller skates on.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3205.636s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3206.577s">So</a>  part of the grant application is that the equipment is installed by June 30th, which is the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3215.662s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3216.383s">So</a>  we recognize that there may be some incidental work that is going to have to be done over the summer months, but the grand opening will be in September.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3230.702s">I</a>  do want to echo the sentiments of my two former school committee colleagues with regards to increasing 11 programs to 20 and all the work you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3240.624s">I</a>  see it in the newspaper and on Facebook, and it's really encouraging and exciting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3245.965s">And</a>  it's the opportunities for our students that they didn't have before. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3249.286s">So</a>  I want to thank you myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3251.046s">And</a>  I look, you know, this is going to be amazing for especially those who want to be in the hospitality or robotics fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3258.268s">And</a>  I think that's wonderful.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3261.33s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3261.61s">Counsel.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3262.49s">Councilor</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3263.63s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3265.131s">And</a>  Mr. Belson and miss miss Richie. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3266.791s">Oh,</a>  thank you very much for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3269.232s">Um,</a>  I just want to thank you for the job that you both have done on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3272.092s">It's</a>  been a long work in progress and you've done a great job and I really think you're doing a great job and, uh, moving vocational education in Medford forward and in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3280.754s">Um,</a>  you've broken down walls, the walls between the high school and the vocational school and you've built, you've built the bridge over to Everett now. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3287.402s">We</a>  built the bridge over the casino, bridge to local 22, bridge to iRobot. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3292.349s">You're</a>  really doing a great job and I think that this proposal is not only well thought out but it's data driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3298.819s">And</a>  I think it'll both fill a void that we have here in the community, but it will also prepare our future leaders for the ability to be successful in our region's economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3307.205s">So</a>  thank you very much for the work that you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3309.306s">This</a>  is something that I'll support wholeheartedly, and I have no problem supporting it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3313.549s">I</a>  think it's a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3315.95s">The</a>  amount of information that you've provided us this evening is terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3320.313s">It</a>  answers any question that I could even come up with if I wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3324.616s">But</a>  this is something I believe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3326.217s">I</a>  think you've done an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3328.189s">You</a>  know, when I was in high school, Medford High and the vocational school were operating in two distinct worlds. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3334.574s">And</a>  since the time that you've been on, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3337.235s">Riccio,</a>  we've seen a lot of changes in the culture up at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3340.318s">And</a>  I think it's for the better. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3341.298s">I</a>  think you're doing an excellent job. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3343.02s">And,</a>  you know, I'd love to see the look on Mr. Kelly's face and Mr. Rendazzo's face and Mr. Mahoney's face come June when this opens up. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3352.326s">I</a>  know that the vocational director when I was in school is no longer with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3355.789s">He</a>  was a great person, Larry Volpe. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3358.097s">And</a>  I can tell you right now, he'd be very proud of the progress that the vocational schools made. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3361.38s">So</a>  thank you very much for your work, and I'm certainly comfortable supporting this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3365.683s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Inouye.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3367.364s">Vice</a>  President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3368.965s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3370.226s">And</a>  I want to thank the superintendent of schools, Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3374.59s">This</a>  is twice in two weeks that you've been before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3377.892s">We're</a>  on a roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3379.153s">We'll</a>  see you next week, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3382.216s">And</a>  I want to thank Dr. Riccio for coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3387.248s">You</a>  know, for many years in this community, and I can speak from previous experience as a graduate of the vocational school, you know, vocational education in this community was always the stepchild and never got the recognition for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3407.195s">And</a>  when I say recognition, meaning funding-wise, there was always a lack of funding in the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3413.737s">And</a>  I think that's why we saw for a period of time <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3416.89s">a</a>  mass exodus from our vocational school to Lexington Minuteman and other surrounding schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3424.616s">Because</a>  yes, indeed, we had shops, but as you just mentioned, they weren't equipped with the latest and greatest of technology or equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3433.963s">And</a>  it got a reputation that, well, we have a vocational school, but it's not up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3439.787s">And</a>  I can't tell you how proud I am to see what's going on in that particular school, how proud I am when I <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3446.445s">open</a>  the local paper, and see our students being recognized for winning awards, statewide awards. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3454.09s">It's</a>  just a very proud feeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3456.351s">And</a>  with all honesty, as was mentioned by some of my colleagues, Dr. Riccio, you've really infused some life back into that vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3469.559s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that you mentioned advanced manufacturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3474.827s">That</a>  was something I put and was supported by this council back probably a year ago, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3480.808s">It</a>  was in February of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3484.789s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3486.529s">And</a>  those are actually the jobs that we're seeing out in the market now. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3492.49s">There</a>  are jobs that are paying 60, 70, 80 grand, which is not a bad starting salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3499.571s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that we're moving in that direction also. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3503.492s">As</a>  Councilor Knight mentioned, when I was at the vocational school, there was a clear, it was like the Berlin Wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3511.316s">You</a>  never passed a certain corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3513.537s">And</a>  it was vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3514.937s">The</a>  high school kids never passed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3517.358s">And</a>  now we have a cooperative learning with vocational and high school kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3522.561s">It's</a>  just a great initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3526.145s">that</a>  kids from the high school may want to explore and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3530.648s">Because</a>  I'll be honest with you, when I was in high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3534.71s">And</a>  I thought a vocational education was where I wanted to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3538.353s">And</a>  I ended up going back to college and didn't work in the trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3543.116s">But</a>  I think it's an option that not everyone goes to a four-year college. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3547.278s">And</a>  it's an option that we can brag about as a community, saying we offer the latest and greatest, not just a vocational education, <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3554.79s">the</a>  latest and greatest in technology and equipment in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3559.392s">And</a>  we're actually partnership-ing now with the city of Everett, which will, I think, be a great partnership to infuse more money into the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3571.158s">And</a>  I'm very pleased to hear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3574.419s">I</a>  do have to put in a plug because I hear it over and over again from parents that, how come we don't have a plumbing shop at the vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3583.803s">And</a>  let me tell you, a plumber is like having a doctorate degree. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3589.286s">They</a>  make their own hours, they show up at your house whenever they want, and they make very good money. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3596.229s">And</a>  I think it's a trade that really, that I think if we did open a plumbing shop, that you'd see full enrollment immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3605.234s">And</a>  not only full enrollment, but when kids graduate, they're gonna graduate with a trade behind them that they can write their own meal ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3613.293s">And</a>  not to say your other shops don't, but the plumbing field, to me, is something that I'm sure there's probably an expensive startup cost, but I think it would be worth its weight in gold to attract more kids to the vocational school, to an industry that, in my opinion, you know, I urge kids to go into electrical, plumbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3639.344s">They</a>  make an honest living. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3640.725s">They</a>  make a good living. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3642.473s">to</a>  support their families and there's plenty of work out there for a good plumber, a good electrician across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3650.095s">The</a>  one question I would ask you is that you mentioned about 100 students from Everett coming over and knowing the size of our program, I know we added another nine programs to our already existing programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3666.499s">At</a>  what point will we be compromising our own vocational school with <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3671.962s">Medford</a>  students. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3673.603s">Do</a>  we have a number in sight that would say, you know what, we're not gonna exceed a certain number. <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3679.086s">Will</a>  Medford students get preference over Everett students if a shop is filling up? <a href="https://youtu.be/djVjfHvwilk&t=3684.489s">Maybe</a>  if you could just elaborate a little bit on that.</p>
