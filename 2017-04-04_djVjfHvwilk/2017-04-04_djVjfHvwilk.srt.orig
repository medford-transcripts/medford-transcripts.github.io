[SPEAKER_03]: To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council.

21
00:24:55,108 --> 00:25:05,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Mr. President and city councils, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $250,000 for providing a cash match.

22
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:13,059
[SPEAKER_03]: for the School Department Capital Skills Grant.

23
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:21,642
[SPEAKER_03]: The balance in certified free cash prior to this vote is $8,604,329.

24
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:27,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Superintendent Roy Bellson will be on hand to answer any questions that we may have.

25
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:30,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Bellson.

26
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:34,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, members of the Council, good evening.

27
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:39,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here tonight with Dr. Heidi Riccio, the Principal Director of the Medford

28
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:49,244
[SPEAKER_05]: vocational technical school, and she's going to go into some detail for you with regard to this particular capital skills program.

29
00:25:49,684 --> 00:25:51,946
[SPEAKER_05]: The money was awarded by the governor recently.

30
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:54,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Contract was just signed the end of March.

31
00:25:55,709 --> 00:26:06,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And there is going to be approximately $1.3 million of altogether between the state grant and in-kind contributions from various vendors and others.

32
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:17,900
[SPEAKER_05]: of their money, but we need a $250,000 capital match to advance our culinary arts and hospitality program and our advanced manufacturing program.

33
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:36,475
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go up the technical school now, you'll see that the old print shop is now being deconstructed and being made into a first-class hospitality and restaurant center, and you're also going to see the advance of the advanced manufacturing activity going on with robotics and engineering going on.

34
00:26:36,898 --> 00:26:42,122
[SPEAKER_05]: things that were never really considered likely in a vocational technical school years ago.

35
00:26:43,342 --> 00:26:46,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Riccio has done a terrific job putting all this together.

36
00:26:46,384 --> 00:26:54,570
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very pleased that the governor saw his way to give us a half million dollars, and I'm going to let her go into details.

37
00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:04,797
[SPEAKER_05]: You have some materials that we've given you previously, but also tonight she's added some supplementals that she can discuss with you so that you have an idea of what we're investing in.

38
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:07,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we think this is a terrific project.

39
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:11,076
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to, uh, advance our activities.

40
00:27:11,136 --> 00:27:11,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Technically.

41
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:17,419
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also going to help us partner with some very significant area individuals and corporations.

42
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,601
[SPEAKER_05]: And we think it's one of the best things we've ever done.

43
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:22,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Richie.

44
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:23,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Belson.

45
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:28,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Belson, city council.

46
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:32,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I have given you two packets of information.

47
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:34,508
[SPEAKER_07]: The first is the,

48
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,216
[SPEAKER_07]: both were submitted as part of the application.

49
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:39,917
[SPEAKER_07]: The first is the budget.

50
00:27:41,617 --> 00:28:03,506
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we looked at with this capital skills grant that came out through the governor's office, I'm sure you have all been well aware of what vocational education is in Massachusetts, particularly since the Governor Baker has come in and has allotted over $35 million in the next three to five years for specific vocational technical expansion.

51
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:11,971
[SPEAKER_07]: In Medford, over the last three years, we have increased our programs from 11 to 20.

52
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:24,236
[SPEAKER_07]: We have also eliminated pretty much the out-of-district tuition that we are paying out of Medford and two out-of-district placements as a result of these new programs.

53
00:28:25,516 --> 00:28:33,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Culinary arts and hospitality is the third largest industry in the world, second only to the healthcare operations and government agencies.

54
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:49,366
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have Winn-Everett or Winn-Boston Harbor coming in that will employ up to 4,000 hospitality workers, not including the addition of a Marriott corporate hotel chain here, which is a boutique hotel that opened just last year.

55
00:28:50,086 --> 00:28:57,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Another hotel and conference center that is opening up in Medford, including the hotel that already exists.

56
00:28:58,268 --> 00:29:08,252
[SPEAKER_07]: lots of different area restaurants, but in addition to that, being so closely situated to Boston, which is the largest convention center in the state of Massachusetts.

57
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:19,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of this, we see a significant need to increase our opportunities for our students and make sure that they're prepared for the future workforce, not just the existing workforce.

58
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:24,938
[SPEAKER_07]: The current space was built in the mid-1990s out of a first floor cafeteria.

59
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,600
[SPEAKER_07]: The space was divided up and sectioned off.

60
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,642
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no window space available.

61
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:35,024
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no easy access to the general public.

62
00:29:35,985 --> 00:29:37,366
[SPEAKER_07]: There is outdated equipment.

63
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:43,991
[SPEAKER_07]: The tile is not appropriate for the kitchen of today, as well as the dining room.

64
00:29:45,231 --> 00:29:48,854
[SPEAKER_07]: The new space was written as a direct result of what those needs are.

65
00:29:49,898 --> 00:29:57,083
[SPEAKER_07]: The space was selected as graphic communications because it sits on an outside area or quadrant of the vocational high school.

66
00:29:57,964 --> 00:30:06,610
[SPEAKER_07]: This means that there'll be easy access from the outside public coming into the vocational school to dine and have their meetings at our school.

67
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:12,795
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be no access to the rest of the building because the entrance will be directly from the outside.

68
00:30:14,652 --> 00:30:18,694
[SPEAKER_07]: As a result, we have applied for the $500,000.

69
00:30:18,894 --> 00:30:20,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, we did not get awarded it.

70
00:30:21,895 --> 00:30:25,276
[SPEAKER_07]: We felt that it was important to go back to the governor and seek why.

71
00:30:26,136 --> 00:30:32,299
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the reasons is that we did not have enough or strong enough partnership or in-kind donations.

72
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,741
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a result, we spent the last 10 months investigating who we can partner with.

73
00:30:39,662 --> 00:30:42,883
[SPEAKER_07]: The partners are situated in that two-page document that you have.

74
00:30:45,113 --> 00:30:59,098
[SPEAKER_07]: We are also looking at advanced manufacturing, and I believe February of last year, it was the city council that actually recommended, which I did receive a letter from Councilman Marks, to investigate advanced manufacturing.

75
00:31:00,198 --> 00:31:09,001
[SPEAKER_07]: As a result, we felt that there was a need to increase our opportunities for our robotics and engineering students and increase advanced manufacturing opportunities.

76
00:31:10,043 --> 00:31:18,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, there's approximately $89,000 of this grant application that was strictly and solely for advanced manufacturing equipment.

77
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:32,332
[SPEAKER_07]: If you see on the second page, and it has all of our partnerships, I can certainly explain the partnerships between InKind and CashValue, if you would like.

78
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:37,157
[SPEAKER_07]: In kind with Bunker Community College is the dual enrollment potential.

79
00:31:37,237 --> 00:31:48,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So we took the average cost of what a three credit course is, multiplied it by the number of students that potentially could take these dual enrollment courses, and that's how we were able to figure that out.

80
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:51,662
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a little bit different than articulated credit.

81
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:58,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Articulated credit is credit that students receive at the vocational high school just by being part of that program.

82
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:00,526
[SPEAKER_07]: For example,

83
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:08,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Culinary Arts and Hospitality has a state-articulated agreement with every community college in the state of Massachusetts.

84
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:19,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, as a result of taking their high school program at the vocational school, they have an option provided they meet the criteria of a B or better to earn college credit.

85
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,201
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the same in the engineering program as well as the robotics program.

86
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:33,106
[SPEAKER_07]: So that articulated credit is a cost savings to the number of students that have the potential to earn college credit just by coming to the vocational high school.

87
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:47,373
[SPEAKER_07]: When Boston Harbor, which I did include each of these in-kind and cash donations in the second packet has a letter of support as well as what those donations or in-kind services are.

88
00:32:49,296 --> 00:32:57,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Wynn Boston Harbor, over the next five years, has committed to $525,000 worth of in-kind donations.

89
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:03,957
[SPEAKER_07]: What that means is that Wynn Boston Harbor, because it is considered a luxury resort property,

90
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:15,578
[SPEAKER_07]: They change out their equipment and services and linen every three years in order to make sure that they're providing exceptional service to their guests.

91
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:20,980
[SPEAKER_07]: We will become a direct benefactor of any of the outdated equipment.

92
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:28,543
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not outdated by anybody else's standards but when, as a result of the type of program and offerings that they have.

93
00:33:29,897 --> 00:33:35,181
[SPEAKER_07]: We will also have monthly guest lecture series programs for our students.

94
00:33:35,682 --> 00:33:46,130
[SPEAKER_07]: What that means is the executive chefs, sous chefs from the Wynn Boston Harbor will guest lecture to the high school students at the vocational high school.

95
00:33:47,131 --> 00:33:54,977
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to that, they have guaranteed internships and cooperative education services or opportunities for our students.

96
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:57,820
[SPEAKER_07]: The Labor's Local 22.

97
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:13,184
[SPEAKER_07]: has donated the materials that it will cost in order to build the ADA-compliant ramp that will be the main entrance area of our vocational school, which is at a cost savings to the district of $50,000.

98
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:22,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Microsoft Corporation, we have three software engineers, two of which work for Microsoft Corporation.

99
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:36,253
[SPEAKER_07]: When companies like Microsoft donate their time or their services to a school district, they can award financial equivalent to the hours of what they donate to a particular school district.

100
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:51,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Those software engineers have awarded Medford Vocational Technical High School their equal salary pay for each hour that they donate to Medford Vocational School, which is five days per week, five hours per week.

101
00:34:53,616 --> 00:34:58,539
[SPEAKER_07]: iRobot donated a robot that the students are able to work with.

102
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:03,501
[SPEAKER_07]: And Medford Public Schools, this is the in-kind of $75,000.

103
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:15,447
[SPEAKER_07]: We believe that our students in the construction fields, meaning carpentry, construction and craft laborers, electrical, HVAC and refrigeration, and metal fabrication

104
00:35:16,236 --> 00:35:22,682
[SPEAKER_07]: should receive authentic learning experiences alongside the tradesmen that we will be hiring in order to complete this work.

105
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:31,330
[SPEAKER_07]: As a result, we specifically put in our quotes that they have to be willing to work alongside our students.

106
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:35,197
[SPEAKER_07]: We believe that our students will receive authentic work.

107
00:35:35,397 --> 00:35:45,760
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have been following us on Facebook or in the blog that Lisa Evangelista has, there are several pictures of our kids directly involved in this project.

108
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,281
[SPEAKER_07]: So we value that at a cost savings to the district or to the city of $75,000.

109
00:35:53,422 --> 00:36:08,867
[SPEAKER_07]: We are also, through Bunker Hill Community College, we have engaged in a partnership through the Northeast Advanced Manufacturing Consortium, in which $48,000 is being given to the district in order to run this program and to pay for certain costs and materials.

110
00:36:11,728 --> 00:36:22,233
[SPEAKER_07]: The second packet that you have is labor statistics that validates the reason why we selected culinary arts and hospitality, as well as the advanced manufacturing fields.

111
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,636
[SPEAKER_07]: This can all be found on the Massachusetts Labor Statistics website.

112
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:34,920
[SPEAKER_07]: The letters of support, as well as the plan in moving forward and the equipment that we had submitted for approval.

113
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:51,765
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have a letter from state representatives, as well as the mayor of Everett and the mayor of Medford, forging a partnership between the two schools for offering vocational courses or programs to students from Medford and Everett.

114
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,293
[SPEAKER_07]: So at this time, if you have questions for me or... You sure?

115
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:04,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scott Pelli.

116
00:37:05,906 --> 00:37:07,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:37:07,147 --> 00:37:27,757
[SPEAKER_11]: So, a few years back, as a member of the school committee, myself and Mr. Falco, I don't think we ever dreamed that the vision that, the reality that we are in today, and the vision that you've led us with, Dr. Riccio, is amazing.

118
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:32,159
[SPEAKER_11]: The thought process in my mind back then was trying to boost

119
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:40,817
[SPEAKER_11]: the programs that we had in place, the automotive, the electrical, the other wonderful programs.

120
00:37:41,197 --> 00:38:02,865
[SPEAKER_11]: But what you've done here now, the leadership programs, the partnerships with different businesses, communities, and unions, the collaborations with all the stakeholders, the alumni involvement, the thousands of dollars that we're saving, keeping our kids in our community, and the money that we were losing

121
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:04,149
[SPEAKER_11]: at that time.

122
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:14,137
[SPEAKER_11]: The sense of pride that I feel for what you're trying to do and what you are accomplishing is immense.

123
00:38:14,197 --> 00:38:15,638
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can feel it throughout the community.

124
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:27,167
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, I had two more phone calls today from parents asking me how can I get in touch with the vocational school where kids were not in vocational education.

125
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:32,812
[SPEAKER_11]: They were in private schools and wanted to come back to Medford and wanting to

126
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:35,664
[SPEAKER_11]: participate in the vocational experience.

127
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:53,674
[SPEAKER_11]: So as this program, as this request comes in front of us, I just see it as a continued commitment that I made back then to try to focus on helping the vocational school be the jewel that it's supposed to be.

128
00:38:54,314 --> 00:38:58,156
[SPEAKER_11]: And with your leadership and the superintendent's leadership, I think we've done that.

129
00:38:58,656 --> 00:39:01,078
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is just an amazing program.

130
00:39:02,124 --> 00:39:04,246
[SPEAKER_11]: I see the benefits in the community that I work in.

131
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:09,769
[SPEAKER_11]: Not to knock them, but they have one wonderful program.

132
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:15,632
[SPEAKER_11]: And they boast on that one wonderful program, and that program is the culinary arts program.

133
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:31,422
[SPEAKER_11]: And what that program does for that community's senior citizens and residents, that they can just walk across the street and take the senior bus to the vocational school and purchase and have a

134
00:39:31,977 --> 00:39:52,291
[SPEAKER_11]: four course meal that normally they can't afford and to come into that culinary art setting and celebrate that and knowing that this is now going to be a reality in Medford and seeing the construction that's being done there and the access that the community will have there is second to none.

135
00:39:52,992 --> 00:39:57,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I told the director this week that

136
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,761
[SPEAKER_11]: the only one piece of jewelry that they had on us is now going to go back.

137
00:40:03,341 --> 00:40:05,042
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're now taking over everything.

138
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:27,588
[SPEAKER_11]: And so again, when you're talking about money well spent, I think this community, and with your efforts, and the way you've spelt it out for us, only shows and reinforces how, not just financially, but prideful enthusiasm that we're getting back tenfold.

139
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:29,196
[SPEAKER_11]: from our investment.

140
00:40:29,236 --> 00:40:30,457
[SPEAKER_11]: So I thank you.

141
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:31,258
[SPEAKER_11]: I commend you.

142
00:40:31,598 --> 00:40:34,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, and I don't care what anybody says.

143
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, no one has thanked me for bringing you to, to, to Medford.

144
00:40:37,923 --> 00:40:39,084
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it was me personally.

145
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:42,327
[SPEAKER_11]: I drove all the way to your home and brought you here.

146
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:46,090
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, that really didn't happen, but I appreciate it.

147
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,771
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

148
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:47,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

149
00:40:47,592 --> 00:40:48,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scott.

150
00:40:48,472 --> 00:40:49,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

151
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:50,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

152
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,737
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank, uh, Mr. Bellson and Dr. Riccio for being here tonight.

153
00:40:54,396 --> 00:40:56,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I am very, very excited to hear this news.

154
00:40:57,217 --> 00:41:02,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, with regard to the grant, um, you know, uh, constant Scott Pelly hit it on the head.

155
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:20,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, when we were on the school committee, we used to, you know, we had the folk and, you know, you know, and I was, I was always at the mentality of, you know, we've had vocational education in this city for over 80 years and we, you know, we should embrace it and we should, you know, give it the funding that it needs.

156
00:41:20,565 --> 00:41:21,946
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we give it the right amount of funding,

157
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:23,422
[SPEAKER_08]: it's going to happen.

158
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:24,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we did that.

159
00:41:24,842 --> 00:41:27,663
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the key components was hiring you.

160
00:41:28,663 --> 00:41:32,364
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean it when I say that, because I tell people this.

161
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:42,346
[SPEAKER_08]: When we were on the school committee, we hired almost every single principal in the district, because principals were coming and going.

162
00:41:42,726 --> 00:41:49,768
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought that, honestly, I look today at everyone that we hired, and I think you were one of our best hires.

163
00:41:50,168 --> 00:41:51,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean that, because since you've come in,

164
00:41:52,781 --> 00:41:56,383
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you've really built the program.

165
00:41:56,683 --> 00:42:03,786
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when you say you've gone from 11 to 20 programs, I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any other school district that has done that.

166
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:20,913
[SPEAKER_08]: When we talk about, you know, out-of-district tuition, the reduction, almost the elimination of out-of-district tuition, kids going to Minuteman, I mean, when we used to have budget time, we used to look at that number and it was just mind-boggling.

167
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:23,528
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was up at around a half a million dollars at one point.

168
00:42:23,968 --> 00:42:24,468
[SPEAKER_07]: One million.

169
00:42:24,488 --> 00:42:24,908
[SPEAKER_08]: More than that.

170
00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:26,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, one million, I'm sorry.

171
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:30,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So one million dollars, and we've reduced that.

172
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:36,212
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a significant reduction, and those dollars are coming back, and they're in our school district.

173
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:42,955
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, the partnerships that you've built, the vision that you had, it's just been amazing.

174
00:42:42,975 --> 00:42:47,516
[SPEAKER_08]: And you haven't even been in the district that long, so you've had quite an impact.

175
00:42:48,096 --> 00:42:49,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, everybody I talk to,

176
00:42:50,447 --> 00:43:00,111
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, vocational, you know, technical, method technical school, I mean, really, vocational education is the rage right now.

177
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:03,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a lot of kids want to go to the voc, go to method technical school.

178
00:43:04,352 --> 00:43:10,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the way I look at it is it's the best of both worlds, because you can learn a trade and you can go to college if you want.

179
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:13,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think those are valuable tools.

180
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:17,837
[SPEAKER_08]: And to come here with this news tonight, I mean,

181
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:26,473
[SPEAKER_08]: To see that all the partnerships that you've formed and the in-kind donations that are coming in, it's just remarkable.

182
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:28,293
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that I support 100%.

183
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:39,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that, you know, the other thing you're trying to do is you're trying to build the alumni network, which I think is huge.

184
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:41,637
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have, and I'm going to plug.

185
00:43:41,777 --> 00:43:42,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, absolutely.

186
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,418
[SPEAKER_08]: You have an event coming up.

187
00:43:44,868 --> 00:43:45,308
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

188
00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:49,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, not I, because it's the Alumni Association, but musical bingo.

189
00:43:50,052 --> 00:43:57,998
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's $25, April 13th, 7 to 11 at the Irish American Club.

190
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And the prizes are pretty phenomenal, actually.

191
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:07,465
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the Sheridan Boston, and I don't know if you know the hotel industry, but April

192
00:44:08,642 --> 00:44:14,826
[SPEAKER_07]: in Boston on a Saturday night is extremely difficult to even get a hotel room, let alone get one for free.

193
00:44:14,886 --> 00:44:24,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were able to get the Red Sox Saturday, I think it's April 27th, with an overnight to the Sheraton Hotel as one of the prizes.

194
00:44:24,753 --> 00:44:31,717
[SPEAKER_07]: We have probably about four or five different sets of Red Sox tickets and hotel reservations.

195
00:44:32,138 --> 00:44:32,418
[SPEAKER_07]: We have

196
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:38,741
[SPEAKER_07]: been nothing but generous, and we've had a tremendous amount of graduates that have donated.

197
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:51,428
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, I know you're going to kill me because you have your Red Sox hat on, but whoever the Cy Young award winner was last year, we have, Cy?

198
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I said it right, Cy?

199
00:44:53,189 --> 00:44:55,690
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, okay.

200
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So, whatever, I know that.

201
00:44:58,852 --> 00:45:00,813
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, we have his baseball.

202
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:12,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we have a lot of fabulous prizes that are out there, but the biggest thing with the Alumni Association is that we didn't have a formalized association.

203
00:45:13,283 --> 00:45:14,604
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know in Medford,

204
00:45:15,542 --> 00:45:21,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we have had vocational education long before any regional vocational school district since 1932.

205
00:45:22,227 --> 00:45:24,889
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're coming up to our 90th.

206
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,453
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result, we need to recognize that alumni.

207
00:45:29,473 --> 00:45:32,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Because often the alumni go, well, how can I help?

208
00:45:32,873 --> 00:45:36,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is one of the ways to help, is to join the Alumni Association.

209
00:45:36,997 --> 00:45:40,380
[SPEAKER_07]: All funds will be given to students alone.

210
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:51,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So scholarship funds to defray the cost of tools, because as you know, if you are in auto tech, you do not get a job unless you already have your set of tools.

211
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:58,936
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to be able to provide each graduate with a set of entry level tools for whatever program they're in.

212
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,906
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what the Alumni Association is really raising funds for.

213
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:05,907
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not for all of us to have a party.

214
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:13,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It's to directly benefit the students of the vocational school as they enter their field of study or college, whichever they prefer.

215
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:26,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So before Heidi goes on a little bit, tonight she came down, she left school, left 200 members of the advisory committees, all 20, 10 per advisory committee up there, working on

216
00:46:27,987 --> 00:46:29,828
[SPEAKER_05]: doing additional contributions and the like.

217
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,089
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people are up there now?

218
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,209
[SPEAKER_07]: 200 plus?

219
00:46:31,229 --> 00:46:31,909
[SPEAKER_07]: There are about 220.

220
00:46:31,949 --> 00:46:32,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

221
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:34,330
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible up there.

222
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:39,113
[SPEAKER_05]: They're working up there, developing all kinds of ways to assist the school moving forward.

223
00:46:39,553 --> 00:46:40,574
[SPEAKER_05]: It's incredible.

224
00:46:41,294 --> 00:46:43,415
[SPEAKER_05]: It's absolutely incredible.

225
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:46,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Hardest part is I had to trust everyone to do the job, right?

226
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:48,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And so clearly, I trust them.

227
00:46:48,538 --> 00:46:51,139
[SPEAKER_07]: I can leave, because they're good.

228
00:46:51,379 --> 00:46:53,420
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we have a- No, meaning leave tonight.

229
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,721
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a bracelet on us.

230
00:46:57,433 --> 00:47:05,877
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, I just wanted to just finish up, I guess, by saying, you know, I really admire the fact that, you know, you never gave up on the grant.

231
00:47:06,517 --> 00:47:10,479
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we turned down, I think it was last year, and you went back and said, why?

232
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:16,161
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that tells, you know, everyone here a lot about you and about, you know, how you work.

233
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:20,943
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, I like how you have that, you know, never give up, you know, optimism.

234
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:22,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we need to push ahead.

235
00:47:22,324 --> 00:47:23,244
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to try harder.

236
00:47:23,264 --> 00:47:24,785
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to see what we can do.

237
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:26,966
[SPEAKER_08]: If we don't get it this year, let's see if we can get it next year.

238
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:28,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's important.

239
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:33,556
[SPEAKER_08]: And I support this 100% and I move approval.

240
00:47:35,297 --> 00:47:36,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

241
00:47:36,698 --> 00:47:37,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Longo-Carrillo.

242
00:47:37,819 --> 00:47:39,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Caravaglio.

243
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the presentation.

244
00:47:42,002 --> 00:47:46,485
[SPEAKER_01]: My first question was going to be the design, but it looks like we all got it in our packet.

245
00:47:46,545 --> 00:47:49,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure all the other councilors have seen it.

246
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:50,408
[SPEAKER_01]: We got this in the packet tonight.

247
00:47:50,428 --> 00:47:51,789
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks very nice.

248
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:53,630
[SPEAKER_01]: Both drawings are in the packet.

249
00:47:54,211 --> 00:47:56,993
[SPEAKER_01]: One question I have, maybe you could just elaborate, I know it was discussed

250
00:47:57,437 --> 00:48:11,543
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple weeks ago, Mr. Superintendent, but maybe you can elaborate with regards to, it was just said a million dollars was being spent on out of district, which I believe was Minuteman, but maybe you can just go over those figures for people out there that are saying, why the 250,000?

251
00:48:11,623 --> 00:48:13,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have, you know?

252
00:48:14,025 --> 00:48:26,150
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you have is you have a situation in which if a school district does not have a particular vocational program, a student from our community could opt to go to a regional vocational school, which has the program.

253
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:31,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the program that has absorbed most of our youngsters who have gone out of the district is Minuteman.

254
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:35,904
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's some to Essex Aggie and places like that for agricultural programs.

255
00:48:35,964 --> 00:48:38,406
[SPEAKER_05]: But Minuteman has been the main thing.

256
00:48:38,426 --> 00:48:41,669
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was as many as 50 youngsters out there a few years ago.

257
00:48:42,369 --> 00:48:49,154
[SPEAKER_05]: And given their tuition rates and the like, with special ed assessments on top of it, we're pushing $1 million a year.

258
00:48:51,196 --> 00:48:53,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year, we'll have, what, eight people out?

259
00:48:53,878 --> 00:48:56,060
[SPEAKER_05]: We have eight people out, and the year after, there'll be zero.

260
00:48:56,795 --> 00:49:04,120
[SPEAKER_05]: There were no applications that came in from Minuteman this year because we have programs that can't touch our young people because we have the programs in-house.

261
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:19,610
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to that, with the expansion of what we're doing and working with Everett and some other communities that need a vocational program, we're actually going to be bringing in hundreds of thousands of dollars each year on tuition.

262
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,113
[SPEAKER_05]: So the turnaround in a short period of time could be close to $2 million.

263
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:31,130
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes back to reinvesting in a school, because when we talk about technical education, you have to reinvest all the time.

264
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:37,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can't just simply say, well, the equipment is there, and it's going to be there for the next 50 years.

265
00:49:37,154 --> 00:49:37,995
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like bricks.

266
00:49:38,916 --> 00:49:40,277
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got to be the state of the art.

267
00:49:41,117 --> 00:49:44,680
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've got to be able to reinvest on a regular basis.

268
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,842
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to give us that capacity.

269
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:53,227
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to give us that capacity to hire people who have a great deal of experience, rather than people who are starting out in careers.

270
00:49:53,967 --> 00:49:54,768
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to change.

271
00:49:55,716 --> 00:49:58,517
[SPEAKER_05]: the entire way we look at the future.

272
00:49:59,017 --> 00:50:01,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that sort of, I hope that answers your question.

273
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,598
[SPEAKER_05]: If you need more, I can tell you more.

274
00:50:02,798 --> 00:50:03,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the AP.

275
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:05,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So 1 million, we spent a couple of years ago.

276
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:06,980
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that during budget time.

277
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:14,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what will the eight, just bringing that number of 40 or 50 students out to eight, what was, what's the cost difference there?

278
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:24,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the cost difference at eight students, probably a couple hundred thousand dollars, the most 150, you know, thousand dollars down from that in a year from now, that'll be gone altogether.

279
00:50:25,634 --> 00:50:32,297
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing that's probably very significant is that Minuteman is looking to rebuild its facility.

280
00:50:33,337 --> 00:50:36,298
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to build a 628-pupil facility.

281
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,919
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have 628 pupils to put in it.

282
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a result, the cost of that is going to be absorbed by the remaining towns.

283
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:46,362
[SPEAKER_05]: There were 16 communities that were in the Minuteman district.

284
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:53,925
[SPEAKER_05]: There are now nine, as seven communities opted to leave because they didn't want to be part of the capital plans.

285
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:56,311
[SPEAKER_05]: that Minuteman was going to assess.

286
00:50:56,671 --> 00:51:05,714
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to guess that some community is going to pay $40,000, $50,000 per pupil to go to Minuteman, because there's going to be a capital charge to go there.

287
00:51:06,315 --> 00:51:08,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And we think it's not a very workable kind of thing.

288
00:51:08,896 --> 00:51:10,256
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the state's going to have to intervene.

289
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:12,797
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the short term, we're out of that.

290
00:51:13,357 --> 00:51:13,778
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gone.

291
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:22,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they were going to get the ability to assess a capital fee on top of the tuition fee, which could have been $10,000 on top of the tuition, which would have gone up to over $20,000.

292
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:24,908
[SPEAKER_05]: $35,000 per kid.

293
00:51:26,788 --> 00:51:27,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Unrealistic.

294
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:28,729
[SPEAKER_05]: We got ahead of the curve.

295
00:51:28,749 --> 00:51:29,569
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw it coming.

296
00:51:29,589 --> 00:51:33,011
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we were pushing back on the Minuteman issues a few years ago.

297
00:51:33,811 --> 00:51:38,013
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also saving transportation, because we won't be sending youngsters there.

298
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:40,734
[SPEAKER_05]: It's another $65,000 to $75,000 a year in transportation.

299
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:43,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of positives in that.

300
00:51:43,775 --> 00:51:50,497
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, the evening school programs that Dr. Riccio has started, bringing people in from the community to learn trades and other things like that.

301
00:51:50,877 --> 00:51:52,298
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be another major thing.

302
00:51:52,783 --> 00:51:58,005
[SPEAKER_05]: for not only revenue, but also to give our people a chance to gain the skills they need.

303
00:51:59,485 --> 00:52:11,249
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one of the discussions about jobs and creating jobs is giving people skill training, because you can't necessarily protect an industry which is no longer viable in this country by just simply saying, let's hope it comes back.

304
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:15,431
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to give people skill training so they can move on to the next industry.

305
00:52:16,031 --> 00:52:21,953
[SPEAKER_05]: And another thing that she's done, which I think is particularly significant, she's clustered and created programs so that you're cross-trained.

306
00:52:22,823 --> 00:52:26,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're an HVAC in some of these other areas, you're learning multiple skills.

307
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:30,647
[SPEAKER_05]: So if one industry goes south, you've got capacity to move to other industries.

308
00:52:31,387 --> 00:52:33,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's exciting.

309
00:52:33,508 --> 00:52:42,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only is hospitality, you know, it's the restaurant, but it's the back of the house, it's the front of the house, it's all the maintenance of the house that goes with it.

310
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:52,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a major, major industry that produces all kinds of jobs and allows people to move across the lines as they cross trains.

311
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:54,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

312
00:52:55,104 --> 00:53:06,008
[SPEAKER_01]: So on that, just in 2018-19 is when we expect zero teenagers to go outside a district, and that's when we'll be able to opt out before the capital assessment.

313
00:53:06,209 --> 00:53:06,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

314
00:53:06,629 --> 00:53:06,869
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

315
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:08,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

316
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:21,514
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with regards to a time frame, if you do get, obviously, this money, and I believe you said it was 1.3 in total, what's the time frame for the build out and grand opening?

317
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:22,575
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to tell them?

318
00:53:23,135 --> 00:53:24,456
[SPEAKER_04]: get ready, put your roller skates on.

319
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:25,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

320
00:53:26,577 --> 00:53:33,721
[SPEAKER_07]: So part of the grant application is that the equipment is installed by June 30th, which is the fiscal year.

321
00:53:35,662 --> 00:53:35,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

322
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:45,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So we recognize that there may be some incidental work that is going to have to be done over the summer months, but the grand opening will be in September.

323
00:53:50,702 --> 00:54:00,584
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to echo the sentiments of my two former school committee colleagues with regards to increasing 11 programs to 20 and all the work you've done.

324
00:54:00,624 --> 00:54:05,905
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it in the newspaper and on Facebook, and it's really encouraging and exciting to see.

325
00:54:05,965 --> 00:54:09,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the opportunities for our students that they didn't have before.

326
00:54:09,286 --> 00:54:10,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank you myself.

327
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:18,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look, you know, this is going to be amazing for especially those who want to be in the hospitality or robotics fields.

328
00:54:18,268 --> 00:54:19,188
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's wonderful.

329
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:21,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

330
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:22,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Counsel.

331
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor nice.

332
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:24,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

333
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:26,771
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mr. Belson and miss miss Richie.

334
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:28,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, thank you very much for being here this evening.

335
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I just want to thank you for the job that you both have done on this.

336
00:54:32,092 --> 00:54:40,734
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a long work in progress and you've done a great job and I really think you're doing a great job and, uh, moving vocational education in Medford forward and in the right direction.

337
00:54:40,754 --> 00:54:46,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you've broken down walls, the walls between the high school and the vocational school and you've built, you've built the bridge over to Everett now.

338
00:54:47,402 --> 00:54:51,588
[SPEAKER_13]: We built the bridge over the casino, bridge to local 22, bridge to iRobot.

339
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:57,076
[SPEAKER_13]: You're really doing a great job and I think that this proposal is not only well thought out but it's data driven.

340
00:54:58,819 --> 00:55:07,185
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it'll both fill a void that we have here in the community, but it will also prepare our future leaders for the ability to be successful in our region's economy.

341
00:55:07,205 --> 00:55:09,286
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you very much for the work that you do.

342
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,828
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something that I'll support wholeheartedly, and I have no problem supporting it this evening.

343
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:15,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a great job.

344
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:20,233
[SPEAKER_13]: The amount of information that you've provided us this evening is terrific.

345
00:55:20,313 --> 00:55:24,536
[SPEAKER_13]: It answers any question that I could even come up with if I wanted to.

346
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:26,197
[SPEAKER_13]: But this is something I believe in.

347
00:55:26,217 --> 00:55:27,338
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you've done an excellent job.

348
00:55:28,189 --> 00:55:34,273
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when I was in high school, Medford High and the vocational school were operating in two distinct worlds.

349
00:55:34,574 --> 00:55:37,195
[SPEAKER_13]: And since the time that you've been on, Ms.

350
00:55:37,235 --> 00:55:39,757
[SPEAKER_13]: Riccio, we've seen a lot of changes in the culture up at Medford High School.

351
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:41,278
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's for the better.

352
00:55:41,298 --> 00:55:42,960
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're doing an excellent job.

353
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:51,766
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, I'd love to see the look on Mr. Kelly's face and Mr. Rendazzo's face and Mr. Mahoney's face come June when this opens up.

354
00:55:52,326 --> 00:55:55,549
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the vocational director when I was in school is no longer with us.

355
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:57,510
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a great person, Larry Volpe.

356
00:55:58,097 --> 00:56:01,320
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can tell you right now, he'd be very proud of the progress that the vocational schools made.

357
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:04,822
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you very much for your work, and I'm certainly comfortable supporting this this evening.

358
00:56:05,683 --> 00:56:06,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Inouye.

359
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Marks.

360
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:09,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

361
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:13,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank the superintendent of schools, Mr. Belson.

362
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,852
[SPEAKER_06]: This is twice in two weeks that you've been before us.

363
00:56:17,892 --> 00:56:18,593
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on a roll.

364
00:56:19,153 --> 00:56:20,294
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week, right?

365
00:56:22,216 --> 00:56:25,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank Dr. Riccio for coming tonight.

366
00:56:27,248 --> 00:56:46,335
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for many years in this community, and I can speak from previous experience as a graduate of the vocational school, you know, vocational education in this community was always the stepchild and never got the recognition for a lot of years.

367
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:53,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say recognition, meaning funding-wise, there was always a lack of funding in the vocational school.

368
00:56:53,737 --> 00:56:56,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's why we saw for a period of time

369
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:04,095
[SPEAKER_06]: a mass exodus from our vocational school to Lexington Minuteman and other surrounding schools.

370
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:13,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Because yes, indeed, we had shops, but as you just mentioned, they weren't equipped with the latest and greatest of technology or equipment.

371
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:19,047
[SPEAKER_06]: And it got a reputation that, well, we have a vocational school, but it's not up to par.

372
00:57:19,787 --> 00:57:25,912
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't tell you how proud I am to see what's going on in that particular school, how proud I am when I

373
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:32,809
[SPEAKER_06]: open the local paper, and see our students being recognized for winning awards, statewide awards.

374
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,691
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a very proud feeling.

375
00:57:36,351 --> 00:57:48,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And with all honesty, as was mentioned by some of my colleagues, Dr. Riccio, you've really infused some life back into that vocational school.

376
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:53,622
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm glad to see that you mentioned advanced manufacturing.

377
00:57:54,827 --> 00:57:59,508
[SPEAKER_06]: That was something I put and was supported by this council back probably a year ago, I think.

378
00:58:00,808 --> 00:58:04,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in February of last year.

379
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

380
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:12,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are actually the jobs that we're seeing out in the market now.

381
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:18,851
[SPEAKER_06]: There are jobs that are paying 60, 70, 80 grand, which is not a bad starting salary.

382
00:58:19,571 --> 00:58:22,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm glad to see that we're moving in that direction also.

383
00:58:23,492 --> 00:58:30,835
[SPEAKER_06]: As Councilor Knight mentioned, when I was at the vocational school, there was a clear, it was like the Berlin Wall.

384
00:58:31,316 --> 00:58:33,517
[SPEAKER_06]: You never passed a certain corridor.

385
00:58:33,537 --> 00:58:34,917
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was vice versa.

386
00:58:34,937 --> 00:58:36,978
[SPEAKER_06]: The high school kids never passed that.

387
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we have a cooperative learning with vocational and high school kids.

388
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,582
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a great initiative.

389
00:58:46,145 --> 00:58:50,328
[SPEAKER_06]: that kids from the high school may want to explore and say, you know what?

390
00:58:50,648 --> 00:58:53,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'll be honest with you, when I was in high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do.

391
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:58,253
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought a vocational education was where I wanted to go.

392
00:58:58,353 --> 00:59:02,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ended up going back to college and didn't work in the trade.

393
00:59:03,116 --> 00:59:06,838
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think it's an option that not everyone goes to a four-year college.

394
00:59:07,278 --> 00:59:14,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's an option that we can brag about as a community, saying we offer the latest and greatest, not just a vocational education,

395
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:18,872
[SPEAKER_06]: the latest and greatest in technology and equipment in our schools.

396
00:59:19,392 --> 00:59:30,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're actually partnership-ing now with the city of Everett, which will, I think, be a great partnership to infuse more money into the vocational school.

397
00:59:31,158 --> 00:59:33,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm very pleased to hear about that.

398
00:59:34,419 --> 00:59:42,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have to put in a plug because I hear it over and over again from parents that, how come we don't have a plumbing shop at the vocational school?

399
00:59:43,803 --> 00:59:48,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me tell you, a plumber is like having a doctorate degree.

400
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:55,469
[SPEAKER_06]: They make their own hours, they show up at your house whenever they want, and they make very good money.

401
00:59:56,229 --> 01:00:04,713
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a trade that really, that I think if we did open a plumbing shop, that you'd see full enrollment immediately.

402
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:12,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And not only full enrollment, but when kids graduate, they're gonna graduate with a trade behind them that they can write their own meal ticket.

403
01:00:13,293 --> 01:00:38,524
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to say your other shops don't, but the plumbing field, to me, is something that I'm sure there's probably an expensive startup cost, but I think it would be worth its weight in gold to attract more kids to the vocational school, to an industry that, in my opinion, you know, I urge kids to go into electrical, plumbing.

404
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,484
[SPEAKER_06]: They make an honest living.

405
01:00:40,725 --> 01:00:41,745
[SPEAKER_06]: They make a good living.

406
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:49,175
[SPEAKER_06]: to support their families and there's plenty of work out there for a good plumber, a good electrician across the board.

407
01:00:50,095 --> 01:01:05,779
[SPEAKER_06]: The one question I would ask you is that you mentioned about 100 students from Everett coming over and knowing the size of our program, I know we added another nine programs to our already existing programs.

408
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:11,320
[SPEAKER_06]: At what point will we be compromising our own vocational school with

409
01:01:11,962 --> 01:01:12,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Meffitt students.

410
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:18,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a number in sight that would say, you know what, we're not gonna exceed a certain number.

411
01:01:19,086 --> 01:01:23,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Will Meffitt students get preference over Everett students if a shop is filling up?

412
01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:26,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit on that.

413
01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:27,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

414
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:39,437
[SPEAKER_07]: We selected the 100 as the magic number as far as what, with our current capacity, could we handle without taking away from our Medford students.

415
01:01:39,677 --> 01:01:41,418
[SPEAKER_07]: So 100 was the capacity.

416
01:01:42,478 --> 01:01:50,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, we are at 365 students that are taking advantage of vocational education, including high school students.

417
01:01:51,282 --> 01:02:01,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you all kind of went to school back in the day, and there are a lot more students enrolled just at the public high school, whether it's the high school or the vocational school.

418
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:06,009
[SPEAKER_07]: The square footage of the space, which is 536,000 square feet of the complex,

419
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:14,281
[SPEAKER_07]: originally housed a lot more students from an enrollment perspective.

420
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:23,264
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do have the capacity to grow, but looking at the current numbers without really looking at where the need is, we capped it at 100.

421
01:02:23,864 --> 01:02:37,869
[SPEAKER_07]: We are also looking at doing a memorandum of understanding biannually so that we can make sure that it fits within the context of what we vision Medford Vocational High School to be.

422
01:02:38,899 --> 01:02:41,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So 100 is that cap at this time.

423
01:02:42,001 --> 01:02:42,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

424
01:02:43,182 --> 01:02:47,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, this has always been objects because of liability issues.

425
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:55,369
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, I'm not sure if that's something that you've looked into, but I believe our school would be a huge asset.

426
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:07,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, in, uh, I always mentioned it actually, when we talk about different projects going on in the city saying, wouldn't it be nice to introduce a vocational school, maybe someone in the metal fabrication would, uh,

427
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:14,547
[SPEAKER_06]: would benefit from a learning standpoint and also from a community involvement standpoint.

428
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:20,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Has there been any movement to having more community outreach with our vocational students?

429
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:21,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

430
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:29,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Ironically, it's the plumbing board at the State Division of Professional Licensure that makes it very difficult for students to go out and work.

431
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:36,335
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other boards have been very flexible in that space, knowing that they are training the future workforce.

432
01:03:37,374 --> 01:03:44,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Vocational education is really founded on authentic learning opportunities, which is not necessarily in the classroom.

433
01:03:44,479 --> 01:03:49,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So we look at the community as an extension of the classroom.

434
01:03:49,803 --> 01:03:56,588
[SPEAKER_07]: In vocational education, I'm not sure what it was in Medford prior to, but across the Commonwealth, those community type

435
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,863
[SPEAKER_07]: projects are extremely important.

436
01:04:00,443 --> 01:04:05,308
[SPEAKER_07]: We also, though, have to consider what is the curriculum of that particular program.

437
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:12,476
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, we no longer have what you would all call cabinet making.

438
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:16,654
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something that we are teaching at this time.

439
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:23,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So if somebody would like us to build cabinets for a house, that is not something that we would do.

440
01:04:24,059 --> 01:04:33,685
[SPEAKER_07]: We are doing, if you look at our standards or our frameworks, so that's really the critical piece is that it has to fit within the curriculum of what that program is seeking.

441
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:39,342
[SPEAKER_07]: However, just last spring, we did do with the community garden, build a shed.

442
01:04:39,982 --> 01:04:49,826
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a grade 10 project because grade 10 would be a shed building project because it has the same concepts for framing as what a residential house would be.

443
01:04:50,726 --> 01:04:52,367
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at this restaurant.

444
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:56,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Our students are using metal studs as well as fire rated studs.

445
01:04:56,689 --> 01:05:00,230
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working with the building inspectors within the city of Medford.

446
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:03,645
[SPEAKER_07]: the ADA compliance officer, Diane McLeod.

447
01:05:04,445 --> 01:05:12,289
[SPEAKER_07]: This is as true of a real project as you're going to get, but what it will do is it will jumpstart us, because you're right.

448
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:20,393
[SPEAKER_07]: When I first got here, we didn't necessarily go out into the community, and I didn't understand why, because most other vocational schools actually build a house.

449
01:05:21,493 --> 01:05:33,262
[SPEAKER_07]: in the community, whether it's with Habitat for Humanity or another organization, or they have their own non-profit foundation that buys the land and then the vocational school builds the house.

450
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Our goal is to be able to do that long term.

451
01:05:37,157 --> 01:05:40,580
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can't do that with 12 students in the carpentry program.

452
01:05:40,761 --> 01:05:45,505
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to be able to build the capacity to be able to do those larger projects.

453
01:05:46,246 --> 01:05:52,593
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to that, there are homes, if you know, through EPA for lead paint.

454
01:05:53,629 --> 01:06:06,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Students cannot work on structures that have been built prior to 1970 without having a certification, a LED-certified, EPA-certified instructor in themselves.

455
01:06:07,116 --> 01:06:09,337
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't want to jeopardize students.

456
01:06:09,577 --> 01:06:13,239
[SPEAKER_07]: If somebody calls us and said, oh, can you do something in this home?

457
01:06:13,399 --> 01:06:15,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we wouldn't do home, actually.

458
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:16,641
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be a house.

459
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:18,682
[SPEAKER_07]: It can't be a personal residence.

460
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:27,967
[SPEAKER_07]: But even if they wanted us to do something here, we would need to make sure that there's no lead paint in that area because you have to have a specialty for it.

461
01:06:28,747 --> 01:06:32,669
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, we are definitely into doing community service projects.

462
01:06:32,689 --> 01:06:37,592
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also working with the Medford Little League and helping them with their concession stands.

463
01:06:38,392 --> 01:06:43,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're hoping to build one this year and then one the following year.

464
01:06:43,595 --> 01:06:46,737
[SPEAKER_05]: You may want to tell them about the cooperative ed statistics.

465
01:06:47,832 --> 01:06:49,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, that's kind of exciting.

466
01:06:51,975 --> 01:07:07,505
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing that when I first got here is cooperative education is a work training program where students in their senior year of a vocational school can go out and work in the field alongside as an apprentice.

467
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:12,403
[SPEAKER_07]: However, by law, they can really go out in their junior year.

468
01:07:12,863 --> 01:07:17,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So our goal was to not wait until their senior year.

469
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,093
[SPEAKER_07]: If the student is ready, they should be able to go out

470
01:07:20,618 --> 01:07:26,160
[SPEAKER_07]: third term of their junior year and seek employment in that particular content area.

471
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:42,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result of the hard work of our cooperative education coordinator, Lisa Berube, who came to us two years ago, she is, or Medford, is the fifth largest co-op placement by percentage in the state.

472
01:07:43,835 --> 01:07:45,337
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's pretty incredible.

473
01:07:45,397 --> 01:07:53,324
[SPEAKER_07]: But I will say it's really the support of the school committee and Superintendent Belson, because we didn't have that position before.

474
01:07:53,524 --> 01:07:59,829
[SPEAKER_07]: So before I got here, we had a teacher that was expected to teach full time.

475
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:02,971
[SPEAKER_07]: and go out and seek these placements.

476
01:08:03,131 --> 01:08:09,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And you cannot do two jobs simultaneously and still expect a different outcome.

477
01:08:09,635 --> 01:08:15,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So by hiring this person, she is out hitting the pavement each day.

478
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:21,542
[SPEAKER_07]: And the jobs that these kids are getting are real jobs that are growing.

479
01:08:21,782 --> 01:08:24,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of them are making $18 to $20 an hour as 16-year-old students.

480
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:35,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned the laborers, Lou Mandarini's shop has been incredible, training the youngsters at Hopkinton and developing things and guaranteeing jobs for them.

481
01:08:36,605 --> 01:08:42,987
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, the construction industry is booming right now, and they're being guaranteed some incredible opportunities right now.

482
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:52,571
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of quick points on going outside, just to augment what Dr. Riccio said, is that we have to pay attention to the Davis-Bacon law.

483
01:08:53,152 --> 01:08:53,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't compete.

484
01:08:54,156 --> 01:08:58,278
[SPEAKER_05]: with certain kinds of activities out there, because that's, it violates certain laws.

485
01:08:58,298 --> 01:09:07,063
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have to be careful, because remember, a high school student can be 14, 15 years old, so certain power equipment that they use has to be regulated.

486
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:10,105
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all kinds of child labor laws and things like that that we have to pay attention to.

487
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:16,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So anytime we cooperate with someone or look for a job project, we have to all take all that in consideration.

488
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:22,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyone who wants to work with us has to get CORI checked and all kinds of other kinds of,

489
01:09:23,658 --> 01:09:32,964
[SPEAKER_05]: investigations to make sure that we're not sending somebody into a place where there's problems, whether they're alcohol, drugs, or, you know, safety issues and so on and so forth.

490
01:09:32,984 --> 01:09:38,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot of little things that you've got to pay attention to, but Heidi's on top of it and she's, she's been terrific.

491
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:43,111
[SPEAKER_05]: And Lisa has been terrific, as has the whole group of them.

492
01:09:43,131 --> 01:09:45,353
[SPEAKER_05]: They've really got a spirit of esprit de corps over there that's,

493
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:46,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Incredible.

494
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:51,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, Heidi, one more question regarding the enrollment.

495
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,563
[SPEAKER_06]: What has the enrollment been in the last three years?

496
01:09:58,206 --> 01:10:12,618
[SPEAKER_07]: It's difficult because I will say by increasing the opportunities for high school students, if you were to look at the Department of Ed website, it doesn't necessarily give a true reflection of the student population that we have.

497
01:10:12,738 --> 01:10:19,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you were to look at the Department of Ed website, it looks like 265 vocational technical high school students.

498
01:10:20,325 --> 01:10:23,387
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we're also serving an additional 130 high school students.

499
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:28,934
[SPEAKER_07]: that are taking advantage of career and technical education.

500
01:10:30,096 --> 01:10:35,224
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have to look at enrollment from incoming ninth graders on the district level.

501
01:10:36,187 --> 01:10:43,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And for example, last year, not this year's grade nine students, but the year before.

502
01:10:43,570 --> 01:10:55,714
[SPEAKER_07]: So our grade 10 students right now, there are 100 incoming, more incoming grade nine students two years ago than there was this year.

503
01:10:57,002 --> 01:11:02,024
[SPEAKER_07]: So the numbers fluctuate, so that's why I think it's important to kind of look at the percentage.

504
01:11:02,084 --> 01:11:03,544
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the percentage of the kids?

505
01:11:04,045 --> 01:11:15,009
[SPEAKER_07]: So on average, incoming vocational high school students over the last two years have been 32% of the student population of incoming ninth graders.

506
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:24,072
[SPEAKER_05]: It should also be noted, too, that next year, every ninth grader at the high school will explore shops at the vocational school.

507
01:11:24,991 --> 01:11:27,272
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've set it up as one of their options.

508
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:28,913
[SPEAKER_05]: They will go through with that as an elective.

509
01:11:29,674 --> 01:11:32,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It will take some time to see a shop in a rotation.

510
01:11:32,576 --> 01:11:34,797
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working out the schedule right now.

511
01:11:34,817 --> 01:11:40,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how many days or how many weeks you're going to put them in, but that's going to be part of their electives.

512
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:48,786
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a chance to see that and see it from, for example, you know, you take something like biotech or environmental science, it just crosses over.

513
01:11:48,806 --> 01:11:50,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It just crosses over.

514
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:53,009
[SPEAKER_05]: There are kids who are going to go from the vocational tech school

515
01:11:54,191 --> 01:11:58,072
[SPEAKER_05]: MIT because of their ability to put it together.

516
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:00,393
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

517
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:06,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I am so pleased with the new offerings and the advancement that we've made in the vocational school.

518
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:14,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's under your leadership, Dr. Ruccio, and the superintendent of schools who has come around over the last several years.

519
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:18,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you, he's really come around.

520
01:12:18,498 --> 01:12:22,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, Mr. Superintendent, it was back in 1983

521
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:33,718
[SPEAKER_06]: I was at the sheet metal fabrication vocational school, Meffitt Vocational School, and I made my first project.

522
01:12:33,798 --> 01:12:34,699
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a mailbox.

523
01:12:35,419 --> 01:12:36,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember taking it home.

524
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:41,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I put it up on the wall in front of my mother's house where my mother still lives.

525
01:12:42,003 --> 01:12:46,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you go by there today, that mailbox, it's 34 years old.

526
01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:48,947
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still hanging on the side of her house.

527
01:12:49,687 --> 01:12:50,868
[SPEAKER_06]: After 34 years.

528
01:12:51,989 --> 01:12:54,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So it shows you the craftsmanship

529
01:12:55,158 --> 01:12:57,039
[SPEAKER_06]: and technology that came out of that school.

530
01:12:57,519 --> 01:12:58,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll tell you one quick story.

531
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:01,520
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to the Roberts Junior High School.

532
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:02,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Never a quick story.

533
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:03,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what can you do?

534
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:05,342
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Roberts Junior High School.

535
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:06,822
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to read from a phone book next.

536
01:13:08,263 --> 01:13:10,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ken Peck was the woodworking teacher.

537
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:11,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And I may remember the name Ken Peck.

538
01:13:12,104 --> 01:13:13,264
[SPEAKER_05]: But he was well before you.

539
01:13:13,284 --> 01:13:13,845
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all too young.

540
01:13:15,365 --> 01:13:17,526
[SPEAKER_05]: And Ken Peck was the woodworking teacher.

541
01:13:18,066 --> 01:13:23,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And the goal was to make a game with a spinner on it, you know, a block of wood with different things on it.

542
01:13:24,452 --> 01:13:26,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And I invented the first mini game.

543
01:13:26,393 --> 01:13:35,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I could never get the block of wood to be square so the block could get smaller and smaller and smaller until the spinning just went beyond the wood.

544
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:36,339
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no wood left.

545
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:37,160
[SPEAKER_05]: It'd take off, right?

546
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:37,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it off.

547
01:13:38,741 --> 01:13:41,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Al Johnson, who became the vocational director years ago, remember Al?

548
01:13:42,423 --> 01:13:43,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Al became the vocational director.

549
01:13:44,264 --> 01:13:48,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Kicked me out of sheet metal at the Roberts one year because he said, you'll ruin everything here.

550
01:13:50,388 --> 01:13:52,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And I never got beyond the lazy brown

551
01:13:53,052 --> 01:13:58,036
[SPEAKER_05]: The dog jumped all the way, the red fox jumped over the lazy brown dog in front of me.

552
01:13:58,076 --> 01:14:00,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So that wasn't my skill.

553
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:02,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

554
01:14:03,881 --> 01:14:04,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilman Batson.

555
01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:17,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mr. Belson, on my behalf, I'm coming up my 45th year graduating from that high school with a second graduating class, and who would have thought we'd see now what you have there.

556
01:14:17,031 --> 01:14:21,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you for your guidance, and Dr. Richfield for your vision,

557
01:14:22,277 --> 01:14:27,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I go up there now, and I'm amazed at some of the things I see.

558
01:14:27,681 --> 01:14:32,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're providing real-world jobs for these kids to learn for when they graduate.

559
01:14:32,524 --> 01:14:32,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

560
01:14:33,244 --> 01:14:39,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one last comment, Mr. President, which is simply this, is that a couple weeks ago I was here, and you voted to submit the SOI.

561
01:14:40,229 --> 01:14:41,549
[SPEAKER_05]: That plays into this, too.

562
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:45,052
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be some incredible things moving out in the next little while.

563
01:14:45,072 --> 01:14:45,712
[SPEAKER_05]: You're part of it.

564
01:14:46,092 --> 01:14:46,973
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been part of it.

565
01:14:47,623 --> 01:14:52,669
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole science labs, fields, other things that were done, all contributed.

566
01:14:53,190 --> 01:15:08,027
[SPEAKER_05]: In the next period of time, you're going to see something that you probably couldn't have envisioned because of people like Dr. Riccio and others who are investing themselves, bringing real talent to the place, and with real vision, and with real, let's say,

567
01:15:08,666 --> 01:15:13,028
[SPEAKER_05]: aggressive and assertive ways to get funding to augment what we get from the city.

568
01:15:13,068 --> 01:15:16,290
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, thank you for your support because you've been there supporting it.

569
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:20,652
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to come to you for city money and we appreciate what you do to support us as well.

570
01:15:20,692 --> 01:15:20,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

571
01:15:20,913 --> 01:15:21,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

572
01:15:24,114 --> 01:15:25,415
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, we have a, someone don't like to speak.

573
01:15:25,435 --> 01:15:29,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, please.

574
01:15:29,977 --> 01:15:32,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew cast today, cushion street method, Massachusetts.

575
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:34,780
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great to hear and

576
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:38,977
[SPEAKER_09]: vocational training for our local students in Medford.

577
01:15:39,638 --> 01:15:45,782
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, it seems it's way overdue.

578
01:15:46,483 --> 01:15:56,830
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I understand, a lot of corporations that are here, the Raytheons and GEs, they cannot find enough qualified students, especially coming out of high school.

579
01:15:59,152 --> 01:16:03,715
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was kind of surprised to hear that the Minuteman bill was

580
01:16:04,370 --> 01:16:08,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the words were up to a million dollars on one annual basis.

581
01:16:10,235 --> 01:16:21,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand and I've heard for many years, if it's true that some other communities send their students here, such as Everett and others, maybe.

582
01:16:22,385 --> 01:16:26,308
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just curious if it's 20 or $30,000 for them to send our children to Minuteman.

583
01:16:30,563 --> 01:16:33,564
[SPEAKER_09]: times 20 something, whatever it became a million dollars.

584
01:16:33,584 --> 01:16:42,585
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just wondering if you put it on a scale, how much did we acquire by renting out vocational and teachers to other students?

585
01:16:43,625 --> 01:16:48,426
[SPEAKER_09]: How much per year and what that total was compared to up to the million dollars?

586
01:16:49,966 --> 01:16:53,507
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, one other addendum, if I could recollect.

587
01:16:56,148 --> 01:16:57,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I recollect.

588
01:16:57,388 --> 01:16:58,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your patience.

589
01:16:59,757 --> 01:17:02,459
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by- May I just finish one- I'm sorry.

590
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:03,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

591
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:28,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I would hope it would be automatic that in the future, even the present, that the Meffitt High School vocational school would be on a first term, first basis to satisfy all of our local students that live here.

592
01:17:29,417 --> 01:17:35,738
[SPEAKER_09]: before we start renting it out and charging and making monies from other students.

593
01:17:36,258 --> 01:17:46,260
[SPEAKER_09]: So to the chair, I'd like to know on a scale, the million dollars minute man versus how much we charged and how much per student we charge.

594
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:56,302
[SPEAKER_09]: And also if there'll be a guarantee that to make sure that our students would have first preference over any aliens that might come in from other cities.

595
01:17:56,762 --> 01:17:57,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

596
01:17:57,663 --> 01:17:59,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Nelson, would you like to address that?

597
01:18:02,656 --> 01:18:09,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Minuteman, this year's rate was something like $17,500 plus $4,500 for special education.

598
01:18:10,922 --> 01:18:13,805
[SPEAKER_05]: That rate will go up and the capital fee gets added.

599
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:17,047
[SPEAKER_05]: We project it's going to be at $30,000 in another couple of years.

600
01:18:19,429 --> 01:18:22,872
[SPEAKER_05]: We're using a rate that is around $12,000 plus $4,500 or $4,000 for

601
01:18:30,142 --> 01:18:33,783
[SPEAKER_05]: special needs plus an administrative fee of about $1,500.

602
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:39,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're probably $15,000, $16,000 variety altogether.

603
01:18:39,945 --> 01:18:43,306
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely a good deal for our neighbors.

604
01:18:43,366 --> 01:18:45,907
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same token, it provides us with substantial revenue.

605
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:48,548
[SPEAKER_05]: You understand the term marginal utility.

606
01:18:48,968 --> 01:18:51,029
[SPEAKER_05]: When you've got so much space, it's already paid for.

607
01:18:51,709 --> 01:18:53,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else is extra.

608
01:18:53,769 --> 01:18:56,750
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we're not costing ourselves money by adding staff.

609
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:58,911
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just filling in where we could.

610
01:18:59,662 --> 01:19:02,184
[SPEAKER_05]: get value with existing operations.

611
01:19:02,845 --> 01:19:06,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

612
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:27,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for a particular... Well, it depends on how many youngsters we have there, but, you know, with... Well, if we have a hundred students, okay, in the building, when that actually is realized, we'll be seeing a hundred times maybe a million and a half to two million.

613
01:19:28,845 --> 01:19:29,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Hasn't started yet.

614
01:19:29,866 --> 01:19:30,166
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

615
01:19:30,506 --> 01:19:33,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought vocational students were already coming here from.

616
01:19:34,109 --> 01:19:37,251
[SPEAKER_05]: They are, but there's, they are, but there's, I believe that's true.

617
01:19:37,711 --> 01:19:42,094
[SPEAKER_05]: They are, but there's about 30 of those right now.

618
01:19:42,134 --> 01:19:43,455
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot.

619
01:19:44,095 --> 01:19:44,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

620
01:19:45,176 --> 01:19:46,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

621
01:19:46,057 --> 01:19:46,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

622
01:19:46,697 --> 01:19:47,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

623
01:19:47,518 --> 01:19:47,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

624
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:54,002
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by, by council Scott Pelly, seconded by councilor Falco.

625
01:19:54,843 --> 01:19:56,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

626
01:19:59,217 --> 01:20:00,138

627
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:00,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

628
01:20:01,239 --> 01:20:02,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco?

629
01:20:02,159 --> 01:20:02,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

630
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Night?

631
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:03,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

632
01:20:04,281 --> 01:20:05,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Longo-Kern?

633
01:20:05,262 --> 01:20:05,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

634
01:20:05,962 --> 01:20:06,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Marks?

635
01:20:06,823 --> 01:20:07,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

636
01:20:07,343 --> 01:20:08,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scott Pelli?

637
01:20:08,204 --> 01:20:08,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

638
01:20:08,985 --> 01:20:09,725
[SPEAKER_14]: President Cameo?

639
01:20:10,025 --> 01:20:10,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

640
01:20:11,326 --> 01:20:13,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven in the affirmative and none in the negative.

641
01:20:14,069 --> 01:20:14,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

642
01:20:14,949 --> 01:20:18,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations and keep up the good work that you're doing up there.

643
01:20:18,252 --> 01:20:19,192
[SPEAKER_03]: We thank you very much.

644
01:20:19,773 --> 01:20:23,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion by Councilor Longo-Kern to revert back to regular business.

645
01:20:25,876 --> 01:20:28,438
[SPEAKER_03]: 17 three to nine offered by accounts by vice president marks.

646
01:20:28,518 --> 01:20:34,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the city administration update the council on traffic improvements in pedestrian safety initiatives.

647
01:20:35,963 --> 01:20:37,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll let you do that.

648
01:20:37,043 --> 01:20:37,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to come back to that.

649
01:20:39,705 --> 01:20:50,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, be it resolved that the city administration update the council on traffic improvements in pedestrian safety initiatives at Wellington circle, mystic Avenue in the fells way.

650
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:51,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice president marks.

651
01:20:53,313 --> 01:20:54,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

652
01:20:55,055 --> 01:21:13,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I put this on the agenda tonight as a follow-up to discussions that have been held by this Memphis City Council over the last several years, and also recent discussions about road safety audits that took place that were audited by the Mass.

653
01:21:13,449 --> 01:21:15,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Department of Transportation.

654
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:21,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it is regarding the need to update Wellington Circle

655
01:21:22,059 --> 01:21:35,103
[SPEAKER_06]: which we all know has been long overdue for many years, and some of it is because of the new Wynn Casino that will be coming to fruition within the next roughly year and a half.

656
01:21:36,463 --> 01:21:50,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I offer this, Mr. President, to get some answers on behalf of not just Meffitt residents that have to deal with the daily traffic at Wellington Circle, but because Wellington Circle is really the intersection

657
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:57,182
[SPEAKER_06]: to Everett, Malden, Somerville, Revere.

658
01:21:57,582 --> 01:22:03,044
[SPEAKER_06]: It impacts many, many commuters, not just residents of this community.

659
01:22:03,745 --> 01:22:15,249
[SPEAKER_06]: It was back in 2014 that the state legislature approved $26 million, Mr. President, for transportation funding within this community.

660
01:22:16,009 --> 01:22:20,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And as part of that $26 million, the state legislature, in their wisdom,

661
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:46,280
[SPEAKER_06]: along with Mayor McGlynn, earmarked $15 million to look at a grade separation at Wellington Circle, which is an underpass that would go from 16 and 28 right through Wellington Circle and bypass a lot of the surface traffic that we're having now.

662
01:22:49,478 --> 01:23:08,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too happy to say that I'm not aware of one penny that has been put forward to help mitigate some of the concerns that we have regarding traffic congestion at Wellington Circle and the need for traffic and safety improvements at Wellington Circle.

663
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:16,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Wind management, I'm sorry, Wind Casino, when they submitted their application to the city of Meffitt,

664
01:23:17,322 --> 01:23:31,732
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioned that they were going to spend $1 million on traffic improvements in Method, including traffic signals, upgrades, and timing optimization at Wellington Circle, and a study for long-term improvements.

665
01:23:32,853 --> 01:23:44,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got a copy of the road safety audit, which was submitted by AECOM.

666
01:23:45,095 --> 01:23:48,077
[SPEAKER_06]: which is at 250 Apollo Drive, Chelmsford, Mass.

667
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:54,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And they conducted the road safety audit on behalf of MassDOT.

668
01:23:55,523 --> 01:24:00,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And the report was issued to the city of Method in March 10, 2016.

669
01:24:01,627 --> 01:24:05,870
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the council would just indulge me, it was a 40 page report.

670
01:24:06,651 --> 01:24:12,775
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to read it all, but I would like to just go through some of the highlights that were recommended for Wellington Circle.

671
01:24:13,285 --> 01:24:15,266
[SPEAKER_06]: and improvements to Wellington Circle.

672
01:24:16,047 --> 01:24:30,096
[SPEAKER_06]: The background on this says the Federal Highway Administration defines road safety audit as the formal safety examination of an existing or future road or intersection by an independent, multidisciplinary team.

673
01:24:30,736 --> 01:24:40,743
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose of the RSA is to identify potential safety issues and possible opportunities for safety improvements considering all roadway users.

674
01:24:41,522 --> 01:24:52,967
[SPEAKER_06]: The RSA evaluates the Wellington Circle intersection along Mystic Valley Parkway, Revere Beach Parkway, Felsway, Middlesex Ave, and Mystic Valley Parkway.

675
01:24:53,767 --> 01:25:07,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Under the jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation and Recreation, a safety audit was scheduled for this intersection as part of the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency approval process for the proposed Winn Everett project.

676
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:11,034
[SPEAKER_06]: It then goes on to say the project data

677
01:25:11,711 --> 01:25:16,573
[SPEAKER_06]: The road safety audit was completed for Wellington Circle on Tuesday, February 2, 2016.

678
01:25:16,973 --> 01:25:25,277
[SPEAKER_06]: The RSA for Route 16, Mystic Valley Parkway, was conducted on the same day with the same audit team members.

679
01:25:25,857 --> 01:25:31,199
[SPEAKER_06]: The agenda for the RSA meeting held at Wind Design and Development offices near Wellington Circle.

680
01:25:31,619 --> 01:25:33,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Method is provided within this report.

681
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:39,803
[SPEAKER_06]: And the report goes on, Mr. President, to list the, if you would,

682
01:25:41,107 --> 01:25:46,331
[SPEAKER_06]: call it, the top potential safety enhancement issues at Wellington Circle.

683
01:25:47,052 --> 01:25:49,194
[SPEAKER_06]: And there probably is about 20 of them on here.

684
01:25:49,935 --> 01:25:57,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're rated, Mr. President, according to the safety payoff.

685
01:25:57,541 --> 01:26:01,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a high payoff for the commuters and pedestrians?

686
01:26:01,985 --> 01:26:04,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it a medium payoff or a low payoff?

687
01:26:04,930 --> 01:26:12,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Also the time frame, is it short term, long term, mid term, and then the cost, high cost, low cost, and mid cost.

688
01:26:13,552 --> 01:26:17,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And who's responsible, the responsible agency for seeing this take place.

689
01:26:18,152 --> 01:26:21,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I just would like to go through a few of these, Mr. President.

690
01:26:21,853 --> 01:26:32,595
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why I bring this up is if anyone goes by Wellington and up on 93, you'll see the steel construction going up for the Wynn Resort.

691
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:35,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's on the fast track.

692
01:26:35,979 --> 01:26:47,848
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm concerned that some of the promises that were made originally for mitigation and to our community are not being followed through.

693
01:26:48,629 --> 01:26:57,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they are, I'm not receiving any information on what's taking place to help mitigate some of the traffic concerns we have in Wellington.

694
01:26:59,508 --> 01:27:03,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So traffic signal equipment, install countdown pedestrian signals.

695
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:09,135
[SPEAKER_06]: That currently does not exist, believe it or not, in an intersection that size.

696
01:27:09,655 --> 01:27:11,277
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no countdown signals.

697
01:27:12,297 --> 01:27:17,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Traffic signal equipment, review signal heads and replace balls with arrows.

698
01:27:17,721 --> 01:27:23,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Traffic signal equipment, repair pedestrian signals from Route 28 southbound facing west.

699
01:27:23,946 --> 01:27:28,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Traffic signal equipment, many signals difficult to see,

700
01:27:28,759 --> 01:27:30,000
[SPEAKER_06]: especially due to glare.

701
01:27:30,480 --> 01:27:35,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Install signal backplates with reflective border and add visors as needed.

702
01:27:36,564 --> 01:27:37,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Traffic signal equipment.

703
01:27:38,485 --> 01:27:42,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearance time has appeared to be short for some intersection movements.

704
01:27:42,588 --> 01:27:46,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Evaluate lengthening the yellow and all red clearance intervals.

705
01:27:46,891 --> 01:27:48,111
[SPEAKER_06]: ADA accessibility.

706
01:27:48,552 --> 01:27:51,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Upgrade all pedestrian crossings to meet ADA standards.

707
01:27:52,354 --> 01:27:58,158
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the largest rotaries in this commonwealth is not ADA compliant.

708
01:28:00,613 --> 01:28:05,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Not sure how that happens, Mr. President, but it's not ADA compliant.

709
01:28:06,458 --> 01:28:14,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Signage, install lane overhead, lane utilization signage on all intersections, approaches to make lanes used clear to motorists.

710
01:28:16,266 --> 01:28:18,508
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I actually live near Wellington Circle.

711
01:28:18,528 --> 01:28:21,030
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how many times I see someone come in the opposite way?

712
01:28:22,552 --> 01:28:23,412
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how busy that is?

713
01:28:23,733 --> 01:28:26,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming the exact opposite way through Wellington Circle.

714
01:28:27,356 --> 01:28:28,917
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens quite frequently, actually.

715
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:30,471
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the poor signage.

716
01:28:32,732 --> 01:28:40,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Pedestrian and bicycle accommodation, evaluate the feasibility for pedestrian crosswalk at Middlesex Ave, where no crosswalk exists.

717
01:28:41,895 --> 01:28:49,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Pedestrian and bicycle accommodation, examine the feasibility of providing separate bicycle lanes along Route 16 eastbound and westbound through the circle.

718
01:28:50,619 --> 01:28:55,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Lane configuration, evaluate removing a through lane on Route 28 southbound

719
01:28:57,117 --> 01:29:01,780
[SPEAKER_06]: approach to the intersection and add lane markings where feasible to avoid lane confusion.

720
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Intersection geometry.

721
01:29:04,882 --> 01:29:10,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Analyze a long-term scenario where the Middlesex Ave signal is moved further north.

722
01:29:10,545 --> 01:29:13,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Evaluate the impact on safety and operations on all modes.

723
01:29:15,108 --> 01:29:21,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I only bring up those few, Mr. President, because they seem like vital, important issues that need to be addressed.

724
01:29:23,073 --> 01:29:26,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we've received a lot of promises from our state delegation.

725
01:29:27,286 --> 01:29:39,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I've talked to Representative Donato, who was instrumental, actually, in making sure that the state legislature did put in the $26 million back in 2014.

726
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:41,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know he's been working hard.

727
01:29:41,675 --> 01:29:52,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Mayor McGlynn asked for what they refer to as a bypass, which would be a lane separation to go underground.

728
01:29:52,843 --> 01:29:55,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mayor McGlynn asked, I believe it was Wynn Casino,

729
01:29:56,832 --> 01:29:59,534
[SPEAKER_06]: 100 million dollars to do the project.

730
01:30:00,335 --> 01:30:16,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not sure where those negotiations went, but I think Wynne would probably be more than happy to pitch in, but they see this as an issue that has existed well before the casino ever decided to come to Everett in this particular area.

731
01:30:16,527 --> 01:30:24,653
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is a major infrastructure need for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, not just for the city of Method, where that's such a

732
01:30:25,022 --> 01:30:29,424
[SPEAKER_06]: a crucial, crucial bypass to many other communities.

733
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:43,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question I'm asking tonight, Mr. President, I have a couple of them is, is there a commitment by Wynn to ensure the changes to increase intersection capacity will actually be implemented prior to the project opening?

734
01:30:44,593 --> 01:30:49,135
[SPEAKER_06]: So they made a commitment of a million dollars and other improvements.

735
01:30:49,715 --> 01:30:54,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to see this commitment prior to their opening of Wynn Casino?

736
01:30:54,777 --> 01:30:59,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Question two, when plans to have most of the casino employees park offsite?

737
01:31:00,178 --> 01:31:03,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've actually mentioned this in several articles that I read online.

738
01:31:04,179 --> 01:31:07,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Wellington Circle is one of the major areas.

739
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,680
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, not Wellington Circle, the T Station.

740
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:18,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Wellington T Station is one of the major areas where they want to park employee cars at the Wellington T Station.

741
01:31:19,382 --> 01:31:24,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if they have 2,000 employees, they're probably not all on at work at once.

742
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:31,003
[SPEAKER_06]: You can imagine the impact to commuters that use a Wellington station and park their cars there.

743
01:31:31,363 --> 01:31:38,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be a devastating impact to the local commuters if that were to take place, Mr. President.

744
01:31:38,746 --> 01:31:45,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, so I'd like to know what wind plans are for employee parking off-site.

745
01:31:45,789 --> 01:31:51,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And has the city of Medford requested wind to fund a long-term study for the circle?

746
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So in addition to the road safety audit,

747
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:58,684
[SPEAKER_06]: which was requested by MassDOT, and they complied.

748
01:31:59,265 --> 01:32:08,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Has the city of Meffitt, on behalf of our residents and our infrastructure, requested a long-term study for the circle itself, Mr. President?

749
01:32:08,992 --> 01:32:15,857
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the three questions that I'd ask for approval with this paper, and hopefully we'll get a response back.

750
01:32:16,337 --> 01:32:21,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And if need be, maybe we need to meet with DOT to push this issue, Mr. President.

751
01:32:22,082 --> 01:32:22,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said,

752
01:32:22,941 --> 01:32:26,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a method issue, but this, as far as I'm concerned, is a state issue.

753
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:40,685
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been on the council a number of years now, and we've been talking about this each and every year for the past 15 years, about what are we going to do with the horrendous traffic queue up at Wellington Circle.

754
01:32:41,052 --> 01:32:47,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there are times I come from Boston that I don't hit any traffic coming or going to Boston, but you know where I hit it?

755
01:32:48,215 --> 01:32:50,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Three minutes from my door at Wellington Circle.

756
01:32:50,976 --> 01:32:55,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stuck in 15 minutes of traffic in the city of Medford.

757
01:32:56,279 --> 01:33:07,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And many of these concerns could be addressed with basic, basic needs, as I mentioned, regarding lane configuration, regarding traffic signal equipment, regarding signage.

758
01:33:07,604 --> 01:33:10,345
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we don't have to recreate the wheel here.

759
01:33:10,843 --> 01:33:20,468
[SPEAKER_06]: This could be done with, you know, just some minor improvements to that circle, which haven't taken place in a lot of years.

760
01:33:20,948 --> 01:33:22,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd ask for approval, Mr. President.

761
01:33:23,029 --> 01:33:23,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

762
01:33:24,410 --> 01:33:25,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Longocare.

763
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:26,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Carviello.

764
01:33:27,051 --> 01:33:31,253
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to second the resolve and thank Councilor Max for bringing this up.

765
01:33:31,373 --> 01:33:35,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually work in the area and I cross the street.

766
01:33:35,195 --> 01:33:37,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I drive it all the time and I cross the street.

767
01:33:37,216 --> 01:33:40,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I went to Cordova for some lunch and

768
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:42,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I have to run.

769
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:48,013
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see a woman in heels running across Wellington Circle, it'd probably be in the middle of the day.

770
01:33:50,513 --> 01:33:55,855
[SPEAKER_01]: The lights are not too bad, but it is still very scary because it's such a huge intersection.

771
01:33:56,256 --> 01:34:00,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right that we've talked about traffic and pedestrian safety in this intersection many times.

772
01:34:01,477 --> 01:34:08,500
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember years ago bringing up pedestrian safety and making it more safe with regards to the lights and the signage.

773
01:34:09,245 --> 01:34:12,447
[SPEAKER_01]: In directing patterns, obviously that has to do a lot with the traffic.

774
01:34:12,607 --> 01:34:15,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember right into the state it really didn't go anywhere.

775
01:34:15,809 --> 01:34:25,415
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would be extremely important to get it done, especially where we are going to increase the traffic with the wind development and increase the amount of cars on the road and parked at the T station.

776
01:34:25,475 --> 01:34:28,076
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only going to congest station landing.

777
01:34:28,217 --> 01:34:35,601
[SPEAKER_01]: If wind wants to park at the T, that's only going to more so congest Wellington Circle and station landing with regards to parking and traffic.

778
01:34:36,386 --> 01:34:50,748
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really hope that the administration is on top of this and can keep the council updated on what initiatives we can take or how we can move forward to make traffic smoother and pedestrian safety more safe.

779
01:34:50,949 --> 01:34:55,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think those recommendation in that 40 page report hit the nail on the head.

780
01:34:55,149 --> 01:35:04,391
[SPEAKER_01]: There's small changes that can be made one at a time over the next several months to a year and make things definitely a heck of a lot better than they are now.

781
01:35:04,471 --> 01:35:05,591
[SPEAKER_01]: So I second the resolve.

782
01:35:06,113 --> 01:35:12,539
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that we do get some, um, a report back from the administration on this and we move forward on making that intersection safer.

783
01:35:14,641 --> 01:35:15,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Dela Rosa.

784
01:35:15,882 --> 01:35:20,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I wish to lend my words of support and encouragement on this endeavor.

785
01:35:21,266 --> 01:35:22,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Dela Rosa.

786
01:35:22,648 --> 01:35:26,051
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Inouye and seconded by Councilor Langel-O'Karen.

787
01:35:26,431 --> 01:35:27,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address for the record, please.

788
01:35:28,012 --> 01:35:33,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, honorable Javier, although presidents Andrew Kasten, Eddie Cushman street, Medford mass,

789
01:35:33,955 --> 01:35:43,042
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to thank Councilor Marks and Brianna and other Councilors for bringing up this situation at the Wellington Circle.

790
01:35:43,642 --> 01:36:01,795
[SPEAKER_09]: In my opinion, it's well over 20 years overdue that the state itself, I would think, should have at least put some bridges or tunnels, water permitting, et cetera, as they did on McGrath Highway and other sections towards Somerville.

791
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:05,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, it has not been done.

792
01:36:05,091 --> 01:36:13,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And meanwhile, since 20 years ago or 30 years ago, they closed the Meadowland Drive and the Wellington Trenton Drive.

793
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:17,502
[SPEAKER_09]: We have multiple apartment buildings left and right.

794
01:36:18,503 --> 01:36:21,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have Wegmans about to open.

795
01:36:21,805 --> 01:36:23,707
[SPEAKER_09]: We have Station Landon.

796
01:36:23,727 --> 01:36:28,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we have Assembly Road is probably only 5% developed, mind you.

797
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:29,992
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just guesstimating.

798
01:36:30,810 --> 01:36:38,312
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the casino's supposed to draw 17,000 cars per whatever, which sounds like a big number.

799
01:36:39,772 --> 01:36:49,275
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's unfair, especially to these two counselors who do business or live in that neighborhood also.

800
01:36:50,135 --> 01:36:54,096
[SPEAKER_09]: And it affects my wife going to Market Basket in Chelsea.

801
01:36:56,117 --> 01:37:00,098
[SPEAKER_09]: In the name of Medford traffic safety, however,

802
01:37:00,552 --> 01:37:06,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw Mr. Gav in this resolution, and I wanted to bring up something.

803
01:37:07,175 --> 01:37:22,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the name of Memphis Public Traffic Safety, again, I want to notify 02155 of two dangerous traffic locations.

804
01:37:24,004 --> 01:37:30,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one is at Route 38, which is Mystic Avenue, the old highway to Boston.

805
01:37:31,562 --> 01:37:35,083
[SPEAKER_09]: heading north from Harvard Street towards Medford Square.

806
01:37:35,784 --> 01:37:41,586
[SPEAKER_09]: There's five lanes on that highway going towards Atlas Liquors.

807
01:37:42,586 --> 01:37:46,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's no parking on either side of that state road.

808
01:37:46,948 --> 01:38:00,993
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the five lanes reduces to only two lanes directly across the street of 141 Mystic Avenue, which has a sign on that building saying,

809
01:38:01,447 --> 01:38:03,388
[SPEAKER_09]: David's auto repair.

810
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:08,171
[SPEAKER_09]: For lack of better words, it's a real goat's F of a situation.

811
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:17,036
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been many accidents there, and I've seen cars turn over, and I've seen people get into wheelchairs and not walk again.

812
01:38:19,117 --> 01:38:26,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all of a sudden, when you hit Atlas, there's an ambiguous sign.

813
01:38:27,382 --> 01:38:29,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Left lane's supposed to take a left onto Hancock Street.

814
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:37,164
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other lane, there's an arrow where it says only, but good luck if you can try to configure what that means.

815
01:38:38,224 --> 01:38:42,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's also a sign where it says crosswalk.

816
01:38:43,447 --> 01:38:46,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has a big, beautiful yellow sign, brand new.

817
01:38:47,389 --> 01:38:51,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And it shows a crosswalk with two people, caricatures crossing.

818
01:38:51,992 --> 01:38:58,175
[SPEAKER_09]: However, wouldn't you know, there's three vehicles parked on the right-hand side at David's Auto Repair.

819
01:39:01,154 --> 01:39:08,797
[SPEAKER_09]: A dangerous, dangerous situation, especially when vehicles sometimes are doing well over 40, maybe 50 or 60 miles per hour.

820
01:39:10,658 --> 01:39:12,459
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of them are outsiders.

821
01:39:12,519 --> 01:39:15,340
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know about that left onto Hancock Street.

822
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:18,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And it reduces, I repeat, from five lanes to two lanes.

823
01:39:18,961 --> 01:39:20,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of a sudden, there's three cars parked on the right.

824
01:39:21,423 --> 01:39:22,343
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're SUVs.

825
01:39:23,183 --> 01:39:27,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can't see over them, especially if you're a pedestrian, wanting to cross some

826
01:39:28,148 --> 01:39:30,029
[SPEAKER_09]: The Old Civilization to cross the street to 141.

827
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:31,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very dangerous.

828
01:39:31,891 --> 01:39:33,992
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the only one, in my opinion.

829
01:39:35,633 --> 01:39:36,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope we get resolution.

830
01:39:36,894 --> 01:39:43,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I brought this up at the police station, at their meetings, and a couple of officers said they would look into it.

831
01:39:44,299 --> 01:39:50,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if it's already been ratified.

832
01:39:50,023 --> 01:39:50,944
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.

833
01:39:51,444 --> 01:39:55,487
[SPEAKER_09]: But the last time I was out last week, I did see the three vehicles still there.

834
01:39:56,022 --> 01:39:58,463
[SPEAKER_09]: whether they're legally parked or illegally parked.

835
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:02,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, but common sense says you're looking for another bad accident.

836
01:40:04,187 --> 01:40:10,130
[SPEAKER_09]: The second one is also a dangerous intersection, and it's my neck of the woods in East Ford.

837
01:40:11,671 --> 01:40:25,199
[SPEAKER_09]: At Park Street, as you're coming down Park Street onto Riverside Avenue, you cannot see over that left house on the end, which is number one Park Street.

838
01:40:25,742 --> 01:40:30,245
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a corner wooden fence, which causes an obstructed view.

839
01:40:30,265 --> 01:40:33,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, there's been many, many accidents there.

840
01:40:33,487 --> 01:40:38,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Some police officers have told me, good luck, because it'd be nice to get rid of that fence.

841
01:40:38,971 --> 01:40:51,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not saying to do it in eminent domain, but maybe you could ask the resident if they'd be willing to allow me to cut the top half of that fence down at my cost.

842
01:40:52,219 --> 01:40:53,200
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be happy to do so.

843
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Two dangerous situations.

844
01:40:55,597 --> 01:41:03,422
[SPEAKER_09]: And the third one I've already covered before, and that was the Roosevelt Circle.

845
01:41:04,243 --> 01:41:05,244
[SPEAKER_09]: No, was it Roosevelt?

846
01:41:06,084 --> 01:41:08,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Wellington I talked about.

847
01:41:08,726 --> 01:41:10,507
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the bridge that should have been there 20 years ago.

848
01:41:11,008 --> 01:41:11,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Roosevelt Circle.

849
01:41:12,309 --> 01:41:18,193
[SPEAKER_09]: As you're coming from Memphis Square, going on to Exit 33, it may be.

850
01:41:18,493 --> 01:41:24,057
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're going towards that first rotary before you get to the rice pond turnoff, so to speak.

851
01:41:25,092 --> 01:41:29,975
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, around that rotary, there's a lot of overgrown trees, it seems, that are wild.

852
01:41:30,435 --> 01:41:32,857
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think in the last year or so, they've been cutting them down.

853
01:41:33,237 --> 01:41:39,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Another dangerous location, because they're really flying around that rotary, and a lot of accidents happen at that rotary also.

854
01:41:40,161 --> 01:41:42,783
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't want to give you more than three today.

855
01:41:43,163 --> 01:41:43,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for listening.

856
01:41:43,984 --> 01:41:45,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Move the questions, Mr. President.

857
01:41:45,925 --> 01:41:46,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

858
01:41:46,425 --> 01:41:47,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

859
01:41:47,206 --> 01:41:50,528
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Max, seconded by Councilor Longo Kearns.

860
01:41:50,548 --> 01:41:51,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, just a quick one.

861
01:41:53,762 --> 01:41:55,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Monk, Vice President Montz.

862
01:41:56,343 --> 01:42:12,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Just if I could, because I think, you know, we have a number of state roads in this community, and I think it's unacceptable when we have to tell residents that may live on Elm Street or, you know, Mystic Ave or Riverside.

863
01:42:12,749 --> 01:42:14,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sorry, not Riverside Ave.

864
01:42:16,851 --> 01:42:21,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Middlesex Ave, the Felsway, that because it's a state road,

865
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,680
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing we can do to improve pedestrian safety.

866
01:42:25,321 --> 01:42:29,601
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing we can do to the traffic signals because they're located on a state road.

867
01:42:30,221 --> 01:42:32,202
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't touch your tree or your sidewalk.

868
01:42:32,822 --> 01:42:38,663
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's unacceptable to tell a taxpayer in this community that we can't do these things or our hands are tied.

869
01:42:39,363 --> 01:42:51,805
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we have to do a better job with communicating with the state, whether it's DCR or Department of Transportation, to, on behalf of residents, to get issues resolved, Mr. President.

870
01:42:52,352 --> 01:42:53,373
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make that known.

871
01:42:54,053 --> 01:42:54,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

872
01:42:54,414 --> 01:42:54,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

873
01:42:54,694 --> 01:42:55,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice president.

874
01:42:55,935 --> 01:42:58,697
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by council mark seconded by council logo.

875
01:42:58,977 --> 01:43:00,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

876
01:43:03,161 --> 01:43:04,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Dela Rousseau.

877
01:43:04,402 --> 01:43:04,522
Yes.

878
01:43:05,102 --> 01:43:05,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

879
01:43:05,963 --> 01:43:06,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

880
01:43:06,564 --> 01:43:07,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Nye.

881
01:43:07,244 --> 01:43:07,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

882
01:43:07,725 --> 01:43:08,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lueb and Kern.

883
01:43:08,605 --> 01:43:08,705
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

884
01:43:09,206 --> 01:43:09,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice president Marks.

885
01:43:10,767 --> 01:43:11,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

886
01:43:11,548 --> 01:43:12,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scott Pele.

887
01:43:12,488 --> 01:43:12,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

888
01:43:13,289 --> 01:43:13,990
[SPEAKER_14]: President Cavill.

889
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:14,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

890
01:43:15,811 --> 01:43:16,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven in the affirmative.

891
01:43:17,505 --> 01:43:19,566
[SPEAKER_03]: None of the negative motion passes.

892
01:43:20,286 --> 01:43:38,413
[SPEAKER_03]: 17, 3, 3, 1 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern, whereas the draft capital improvement plan has been changed significantly, be it resolved that the administration forward the Memphis City Council a copy of the new capital improvement plan or draft a new capital improvement plan within the next 30 days.

893
01:43:38,433 --> 01:43:39,033
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Langel-Kern.

894
01:43:43,143 --> 01:43:44,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Carviello.

895
01:43:44,684 --> 01:43:46,284
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be short but sweet.

896
01:43:46,504 --> 01:43:49,045
[SPEAKER_01]: This is with regards to the capital improvement plan.

897
01:43:49,085 --> 01:43:54,267
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a draft that we were given months ago, and it has been significantly changed.

898
01:43:54,327 --> 01:44:07,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So this council has spoke about it within the last month or so with regards to receiving a copy, hoping to receive a copy of the new capital improvement plan, or even just a new draft that we can review.

899
01:44:07,832 --> 01:44:11,593
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something that's going to be extremely important before June, before we

900
01:44:12,366 --> 01:44:15,767
[SPEAKER_01]: start discussing the budget on beginning of June.

901
01:44:17,568 --> 01:44:25,111
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed tonight in the papers that we had in our packet, there's another equipment request that's going to be going to the mayor for over $100,000.

902
01:44:26,132 --> 01:44:38,117
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has to have been, between this and I'm sure many other equipment needs and other things that are going to need to go into a capital improvement plan, I'm sure it has changed

903
01:44:38,657 --> 01:44:41,999
[SPEAKER_01]: not only with regards to the police department, but in other ways.

904
01:44:42,099 --> 01:44:50,144
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be nice to get a new updated plan or a new draft plan so we have something to go off of and we know which direction we're moving forward.

905
01:44:50,664 --> 01:45:02,711
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have that expenditure for the new police station, that's associated with about $20 to $22 million, which we weren't expecting until a few more years from now.

906
01:45:03,251 --> 01:45:05,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Now things are going to have to shift around.

907
01:45:05,412 --> 01:45:06,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to know where the

908
01:45:07,294 --> 01:45:18,540
[SPEAKER_01]: where the administration sees the city moving forward with regards to the capital plan and what is next down the line and how we're going to fit the fire station in and where does the library fall.

909
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:29,366
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to see what the administration has in mind and that we can have it in front of us and be able to ask questions, especially when we do come down to budget talks, which is a month and a half from now.

910
01:45:30,006 --> 01:45:30,326
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

911
01:45:31,327 --> 01:45:32,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Roll call, please.

912
01:45:33,888 --> 01:45:37,070
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of approval by Councillor Knight,

913
01:45:37,595 --> 01:45:38,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call has been requested.

914
01:45:43,157 --> 01:45:44,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor DelaRusso?

915
01:45:44,297 --> 01:45:44,537
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

916
01:45:46,558 --> 01:45:47,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco?

917
01:45:47,458 --> 01:45:47,698
Yes.

918
01:45:48,518 --> 01:45:49,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Night?

919
01:45:49,239 --> 01:45:49,499
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

920
01:45:50,199 --> 01:45:50,899
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Hunter-Kern?

921
01:45:50,999 --> 01:45:51,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

922
01:45:51,940 --> 01:45:52,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Mox?

923
01:45:52,860 --> 01:45:53,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

924
01:45:55,241 --> 01:45:56,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

925
01:45:56,321 --> 01:45:56,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

926
01:45:56,601 --> 01:45:57,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Cabrillo?

927
01:45:57,781 --> 01:45:58,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

928
01:45:59,122 --> 01:46:00,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

929
01:46:01,302 --> 01:46:02,803
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is adopted.

930
01:46:04,083 --> 01:46:08,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Paper 17-336, offered by President Caviello.

931
01:46:09,147 --> 01:46:23,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Be resolved that the Memphis City Council contact National Grid Gas to immediately repair sidewalk in front of 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway to the corner of Winthrop Street for public safety concerns.

932
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:25,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Council President.

933
01:46:26,301 --> 01:46:26,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

934
01:46:27,221 --> 01:46:31,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I think about three weeks ago there was a gas leak

935
01:46:32,556 --> 01:46:34,257
[SPEAKER_03]: at 2500 Misty Valley Parkway.

936
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:37,220
[SPEAKER_03]: And it lasted, I think, for about a day.

937
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:47,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And since then, there has been no repair of that sidewalk that goes from 2500 Misty Valley Parkway all the way down to the lights at Winter Street.

938
01:46:47,568 --> 01:46:58,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go by there, there's no plates, and there's nothing, and there's a couple of sinkholes there that are very dangerous, and that is on the path where people walk their children to school at St.

939
01:46:58,657 --> 01:46:59,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Joseph's.

940
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:02,459
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I have not seen anybody from the gas company there.

941
01:47:03,099 --> 01:47:05,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I put in a call, I got no response.

942
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:08,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I think it's something that the administration needs to do immediately.

943
01:47:08,961 --> 01:47:14,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, because those sinkholes are getting bigger as the rain keeps coming over these next few days.

944
01:47:15,324 --> 01:47:19,265
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're not going to fix the sidewalk immediately, at least put some plates there.

945
01:47:21,506 --> 01:47:27,788
[SPEAKER_03]: So the parents, when they walk their children to school, a lot of the seniors, I see a lot of seniors walk by, they're walking to Memphis Square, don't get hurt.

946
01:47:31,612 --> 01:47:37,153
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Council President Caviello, uh, seconded by Councilor Lungo Kern.

947
01:47:37,213 --> 01:47:37,793
[SPEAKER_06]: All in favor?

948
01:47:38,413 --> 01:47:38,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

949
01:47:39,313 --> 01:47:39,953
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

950
01:47:40,174 --> 01:47:41,214
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is adopted.

951
01:47:42,034 --> 01:47:51,176
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could, uh, just from the chair, uh, we all received in our packet, uh, from, uh, correspondence from, uh, the City of Method Conservation Commission.

952
01:47:51,696 --> 01:47:58,118
[SPEAKER_06]: They're having a notice of public hearing, uh, in room 201 on April 5th, beginning at 6.30 PM.

953
01:47:59,897 --> 01:48:24,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the hearing is regarding the notice of intent, uh, electrical transmission project says end style electric company doing business as ever source energy has filed a notice of intent regarding the installation of a new underground electrical transmission line at multiple locations within existing pave roadways along Winthrop street, salt street and mystic Ave and beneath the mystic river.

954
01:48:25,313 --> 01:48:28,835
[SPEAKER_06]: A portion of the proposed activity is located within bordering land

955
01:48:29,288 --> 01:48:37,854
[SPEAKER_06]: subject to flooding associated with the Mystic River, the 100-foot buffer zone to Inland Bank, and the 200-foot riverfront area.

956
01:48:39,175 --> 01:48:58,409
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why I bring this up is this is the issue that Eversource came before the council roughly, I think it was eight months to a year ago, and they're gonna be digging a trench roughly, I think it's two and a half miles through our city, starting at the Winchester Line on Winthrop Street, going down Salt Street,

957
01:48:58,867 --> 01:49:05,651
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Mystic Ave, and they're gonna be digging, I think, a three or four foot trench along the road.

958
01:49:05,671 --> 01:49:17,037
[SPEAKER_06]: There's gonna be interruption to people using their driveways, and it's a very important project, and I think one that residents should be aware of.

959
01:49:18,117 --> 01:49:21,379
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask, and I'm not sure today is the, what, the fourth?

960
01:49:22,419 --> 01:49:24,020
[SPEAKER_06]: This meeting is tomorrow, April 5th.

961
01:49:24,761 --> 01:49:27,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe if the council sees fit,

962
01:49:27,885 --> 01:49:44,229
[SPEAKER_06]: that a reverse 911 go out to area residents, alerting them of this very important meeting, which is going to be a major disruption on Winthrop Salt Street and Mystic Ave, not only for area residents, but also people commuting through that particular area.

963
01:49:45,929 --> 01:49:53,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion made by Councilor Lungo-Kurt, thank you.

964
01:49:53,111 --> 01:49:54,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Falco?

965
01:49:54,171 --> 01:49:57,232
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, I would second the motion

966
01:49:58,627 --> 01:49:59,667
[SPEAKER_08]: the reverse 9-1-1.

967
01:49:59,707 --> 01:50:01,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a very important issue.

968
01:50:01,228 --> 01:50:09,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to make, while you're on the topic of meetings for tomorrow night, I just wanted to also mention that tomorrow night is a community police meeting.

969
01:50:09,390 --> 01:50:11,831
[SPEAKER_08]: This one is at the West Meffitt Community Center.

970
01:50:12,451 --> 01:50:13,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Starts at 7 p.m.

971
01:50:13,511 --> 01:50:18,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's invited, no matter what part of the city you're from, but just wanted to let everyone know.

972
01:50:18,833 --> 01:50:20,453
[SPEAKER_08]: So tomorrow night's a busy night.

973
01:50:21,814 --> 01:50:22,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

974
01:50:22,674 --> 01:50:25,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was seconded by Councilor Longo that reverse 9-1-1 go out.

975
01:50:27,589 --> 01:50:40,812
[SPEAKER_06]: informing residents of the Conservation Commission meeting held tomorrow at 6.30 in room 201 here at City Hall regarding the Eversource underground electrical project that'll be taking place.

976
01:50:41,772 --> 01:50:42,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

977
01:50:42,852 --> 01:50:54,075
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, while we're making announcements, I just would like the opportunity to respond to the council relative to a resolution that was put on a couple weeks ago regarding the street sweeping schedule.

978
01:50:55,093 --> 01:51:05,739
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been brought to my attention through the mayor's liaison to the City Council that street sweeping will begin on Monday the 10th and will continue through the 28th.

979
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:07,180
[SPEAKER_13]: It will happen from 8 a.m.

980
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:07,860
[SPEAKER_13]: to 6 p.m.

981
01:51:08,101 --> 01:51:09,521
[SPEAKER_13]: on a zone-by-zone basis.

982
01:51:10,522 --> 01:51:12,583
[SPEAKER_13]: The DPW has established 14 zones.

983
01:51:13,103 --> 01:51:18,727
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also been brought to my attention that the Metro Police Department will be enforcing parking restrictions and cars will be towed.

984
01:51:19,287 --> 01:51:24,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Parking will be allowed on designated major arteries, however, and there will be no street sweeping on Patriot's Day, Mr. President.

985
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:32,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, if you go to the city's website under important links, you'll be able to find out what zone your, um, home would be classified under.

986
01:51:33,285 --> 01:51:48,858
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, if you don't have internet access, you're encouraged to call 7, 8, 1, 3, 9, 6, 5,500 and they will be able to tell you what zone you live in and tell you when your street sweeping is going to occur so that you do not face the wrath of the Medford police enforcing the parking restrictions during the spring sweep.

987
01:51:50,519 --> 01:51:51,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, counselor.

988
01:51:53,647 --> 01:51:57,288
[SPEAKER_06]: offered by 17-333 offered by Councilor Lungo Kern.

989
01:51:57,788 --> 01:52:13,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Meffitt City Council announce the Meffitt High School Drama Club's production of Pippin, which will be held on Thursday, April 6th at 7.30, Friday, April 7th at 7.30, and next Saturday, April 8th at 2.30 and 7.30.

990
01:52:13,730 --> 01:52:14,611
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Lungo Kern.

991
01:52:16,031 --> 01:52:17,991
[SPEAKER_01]: Briefly, thank you, Vice President Marks.

992
01:52:18,431 --> 01:52:23,152
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brought to my attention that the high school students will be performing Pippin

993
01:52:24,941 --> 01:52:25,521
[SPEAKER_01]: this weekend.

994
01:52:25,962 --> 01:52:32,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's obviously a great addition to Medford and the activities that are going on this weekend.

995
01:52:33,846 --> 01:52:40,429
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle school at the McGlynn School had Annie last spring, which was amazing.

996
01:52:40,509 --> 01:52:46,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe they did another performance about a month ago, which I heard was great as well.

997
01:52:46,152 --> 01:52:49,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that Annie was a sold out show.

998
01:52:50,154 --> 01:52:54,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do want tickets, definitely make sure you get those.

999
01:52:54,793 --> 01:52:57,194
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a great performance, and I'm looking forward to it.

1000
01:52:57,234 --> 01:52:59,335
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to announce it to the public.

1001
01:53:02,576 --> 01:53:05,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Pippin, I think it's like a Pippi Longstocking type of.

1002
01:53:07,178 --> 01:53:08,719
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't sing, so I'm not going to sing one.

1003
01:53:08,879 --> 01:53:12,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1004
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:14,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah Grant is the director.

1005
01:53:14,701 --> 01:53:19,063
[SPEAKER_01]: She does the middle school and the high school, and she does an amazing job with the students.

1006
01:53:19,697 --> 01:53:25,898
[SPEAKER_01]: They work all year long on the set, and obviously practicing the performance, and I wish them the best of luck.

1007
01:53:26,258 --> 01:53:29,539
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Langel-Kern.

1008
01:53:29,559 --> 01:53:49,122
[SPEAKER_03]: 17.332, offered by Councilor Langel-Kern, be it resolved that the administration appoint a Civic Advisory Committee to oversee development projects for review of potential developments consisting of four units or more, and or a Civic Advisory Committee per project made up of residents that live in each potentially

1009
01:53:49,566 --> 01:53:51,687
[SPEAKER_03]: developable area.

1010
01:53:51,827 --> 01:53:52,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

1011
01:53:53,047 --> 01:53:53,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1012
01:53:53,508 --> 01:53:54,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm president Carviello.

1013
01:53:54,788 --> 01:54:00,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this goes hand in hand with what the city council's subcommittee and council as a whole is trying to do.

1014
01:54:00,891 --> 01:54:13,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we've spoke about it before updating our zoning ordinances, which after research that I did a few months ago, it seems to take, it seems like it's going to take years, not, not just months or weeks.

1015
01:54:13,716 --> 01:54:14,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take years.

1016
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:18,698
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's time that we as a community and neighborhoods don't have,

1017
01:54:19,517 --> 01:54:28,360
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did some more research, and I always am drawn to Somerville because they do have a lot of development, and the people seem to be really, really involved.

1018
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:39,303
[SPEAKER_01]: And our people are starting, our residents, Medford residents, especially when a development's coming to different neighborhoods, are starting to want to get involved.

1019
01:54:39,343 --> 01:54:42,704
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be part of how the city moves forward.

1020
01:54:42,824 --> 01:54:45,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And Somerville has a number of different committees

1021
01:54:46,576 --> 01:55:07,709
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple that I have researched in the last couple weeks, I know there's a Union Square Community Advisory Committee, CAC, and they oversee the planning process, and it's something that helps the aldermen in Somerville, I was able to view a meeting, helps them decide where to go and what to do and what to fight for.

1022
01:55:09,149 --> 01:55:11,531
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way for the aldermen to know the concerns.

1023
01:55:11,611 --> 01:55:14,653
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way to help the Zoning Board of Appeals in Somerville.

1024
01:55:15,934 --> 01:55:16,955
[SPEAKER_01]: do what they have to do.

1025
01:55:18,416 --> 01:55:25,143
[SPEAKER_01]: These committees help, they lead workshops, they run surveys, they do mapping exercises.

1026
01:55:25,163 --> 01:55:34,491
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost, when I was reading about it, it almost reminded me of what the Medford Community Coalition does when you have, how do you see Medford workshops they've had in the past.

1027
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:40,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And these committees in Somerville do this with regards to zoning, development, a number of different things.

1028
01:55:40,937 --> 01:55:41,498
[SPEAKER_01]: There was even a

1029
01:55:42,398 --> 01:56:11,815
[SPEAKER_01]: George may be able to comment on, I don't know if you, there was research that I did, and it was with regards to how to bring in food establishments that are beneficial to the community and the environment, and they're light years above what we're doing here in Medford, and I think this is a great tool that would help advance positivity and smart, not smart, it would, in Somerville, grassroots effort, and it encapsules

1030
01:56:12,348 --> 01:56:18,971
[SPEAKER_01]: community values and meaningful decision making that I believe is needed in Medford.

1031
01:56:19,131 --> 01:56:26,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was brought to my attention when I did my research, and then we also had a Medford resident who brought it up at the podium.

1032
01:56:27,095 --> 01:56:34,119
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if she wants me to recognize her name, but a Medford resident did mention a community group that does this.

1033
01:56:34,899 --> 01:56:39,922
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we need to see who's interested and figure out if we need one committee to help,

1034
01:56:41,156 --> 01:57:04,455
[SPEAKER_01]: or if it's a section by section type of thing, whether that be like a Wellington Civic Advisory Committee and North Medford, South Medford, West Medford, just so people can get involved and we can have community meetings that are gonna definitely move the city forward the way the community wants, the way the neighbors and neighborhoods want development to go.

1035
01:57:04,475 --> 01:57:07,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's extremely, it's extremely important

1036
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:12,122
[SPEAKER_01]: component to the City Council revamping our zoning ordinances.

1037
01:57:12,402 --> 01:57:36,173
[SPEAKER_01]: We could spend days, weeks, months, years doing it, but we want the community involved and there are people, residents, smart people that want to be involved and that really have opinions and want to move forward and see and branch out and see where everybody else wants to see this city, how we want to see it developed and what we want to see more of and less of and just do it in a fashion that is

1038
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:53,644
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously better than we're doing now because how it's worked in the last several years is just, it's created uproars, it's created litigation that is unnecessary and we need to figure out another way and I think this is definitely one component that will help in that a great deal.

1039
01:57:54,365 --> 01:58:04,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Another committee that I had looked into or did a little research onto is they have Union Square is going through a lot of development and they have the Somerville

1040
01:58:05,090 --> 01:58:13,194
[SPEAKER_01]: community corporation and a Union Square committee that is helping the city of Somerville, just with that section.

1041
01:58:13,274 --> 01:58:21,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I wanted to kind of leave my resolve open-ended, whether it be discussion with the council or if the administration sees fit to review it on their own.

1042
01:58:22,078 --> 01:58:27,720
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go have a number of different committees within the city, or you could just have one that oversees projects.

1043
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:33,803
[SPEAKER_01]: There's four more units coming in that we have a committee that looks at the plans

1044
01:58:34,146 --> 01:58:38,607
[SPEAKER_01]: goes over the plans, brings people together with community meetings.

1045
01:58:39,608 --> 01:58:52,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember coming in City Hall probably a couple months ago, and it took me three different stops and three different offices to get plans for a development that was taking place on Salem Street.

1046
01:58:53,012 --> 01:58:57,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And those plans, they were there, I was able to view them eventually, but they weren't accessible.

1047
01:58:58,033 --> 01:59:00,354
[SPEAKER_01]: The city of Somerville has their plans online.

1048
01:59:00,845 --> 01:59:07,989
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just a number of different things that Medford's kind of behind the eight ball on, and for transparency purposes is needed in Medford.

1049
01:59:08,409 --> 01:59:20,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope my council colleagues support this, and I hope the administration takes an active look and implements some sort of civic advisory committee, whether that be one or many, to help move the city forward.

1050
01:59:21,597 --> 01:59:22,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1051
01:59:23,438 --> 01:59:27,921
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kern, name and address of the record, please.

1052
01:59:28,821 --> 01:59:31,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

1053
01:59:31,722 --> 01:59:33,702
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a future candidate for the City Council.

1054
01:59:34,522 --> 01:59:37,883
[SPEAKER_00]: My involvement in the city came to the public because of development.

1055
01:59:38,043 --> 01:59:47,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I had seen the for sale sign on Salem Street at the Break Pro and I started coming into City Hall to see what was happening and accidentally stumbled upon the Locust Street plan.

1056
01:59:48,825 --> 01:59:55,126
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of citizens would just really be happy if we knew about these things before they were in the final stage.

1057
01:59:55,786 --> 01:59:56,886
[SPEAKER_00]: The Locust Street project,

1058
01:59:57,987 --> 02:00:13,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to the zoning board meeting that was pretty much when we saw how this project was going to take place from a supermarket to a 490 unit apartment building which is now in litigation because they didn't seek community input the community had no idea that this project was coming to being until.

1059
02:00:14,563 --> 02:00:21,109
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens started posting on Facebook and alerting people and encouraging them to come to City Hall and Yahoo groups.

1060
02:00:21,530 --> 02:00:25,673
[SPEAKER_00]: If this committee was able to even just let people know that this is coming.

1061
02:00:26,214 --> 02:00:34,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I live on Park Street and have lived there for more than a decade and I didn't know that condo development was coming up at 179 Park Street.

1062
02:00:36,143 --> 02:00:38,044
[SPEAKER_00]: until it had already started to be built.

1063
02:00:38,465 --> 02:00:39,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never heard of it.

1064
02:00:39,705 --> 02:00:49,091
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people that live on my street had no idea that there was even a Salem Street project being discussed because we're not within that 300 feet, even though that will impact us.

1065
02:00:49,511 --> 02:00:58,797
[SPEAKER_00]: The parents at the school that is the Roberts Elementary School that is kitty corner to this project didn't know about it until it started to be posted on Facebook.

1066
02:00:59,298 --> 02:01:04,841
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing else, if we can get people to know what is happening so that we can understand what

1067
02:01:05,130 --> 02:01:12,947
[SPEAKER_00]: the downfalls will be, what the benefits will be, the cost analysis, the impact on the schools, the impact on traffic.

1068
02:01:13,455 --> 02:01:18,357
[SPEAKER_00]: on parking, these things are all important to us as Medford residents and we need to know.

1069
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:29,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Just today on Facebook, there's a property that's being listed as a 1900 unit house, a 1900 square foot house with three bedrooms and two baths.

1070
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:37,102
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for sale for $1 million and the listing says the home and garage are in average to good condition, need updating and rehab work.

1071
02:01:37,442 --> 02:01:39,483
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this property is all about the land.

1072
02:01:40,851 --> 02:01:47,455
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential to build, Sella does not guarantee this, although any potential buyer should perform due diligence on the potential of this lot.

1073
02:01:47,996 --> 02:01:58,183
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're encouraging developers to come and look at this property that's in a single family zoned area and they're telling them that you can probably build several units here.

1074
02:01:58,783 --> 02:02:07,309
[SPEAKER_00]: The community needs to be aware of this and we need to be watchful because nobody wants to find out when the ground is being broken on their street because they're outside

1075
02:02:07,689 --> 02:02:20,480
[SPEAKER_00]: that 300-foot area, that there's now going to be five families living 10 houses away that may have 10 to 12 more cars that will be on the street because we're giving parking variances.

1076
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:25,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that's very important to the community as a whole, and I hope that you'll follow up on this.

1077
02:02:26,404 --> 02:02:26,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1078
02:02:26,945 --> 02:02:27,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1079
02:02:27,905 --> 02:02:35,011
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kerr and seconded by Councilor Falco, roll call vote has been requested.

1080
02:02:35,051 --> 02:02:35,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk?

1081
02:02:37,183 --> 02:02:38,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Marks.

1082
02:02:39,684 --> 02:02:40,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1083
02:02:40,944 --> 02:02:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a good resolve.

1084
02:02:43,065 --> 02:02:54,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Any way we can outreach to the community and make sure that residents have ample notice, whether they want to support or go against a project, I think is a step in the right direction.

1085
02:02:55,529 --> 02:02:58,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think that we could write this within our zoning ordinance.

1086
02:02:59,410 --> 02:03:06,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as was mentioned by Cheryl, about the 300-foot buffer that we have to notify residents, we, as a council,

1087
02:03:07,167 --> 02:03:13,869
[SPEAKER_06]: can require 500 feet, 1,000 feet through our zoning ordinance, Mr. President.

1088
02:03:14,269 --> 02:03:23,193
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can also, through our zoning ordinance, I believe, set up community advisory committees that require projects to go through particular committees.

1089
02:03:23,553 --> 02:03:31,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a very good idea if you want to have committees set up in each neighborhood or one central committee that would cover the entire city.

1090
02:03:32,496 --> 02:03:35,737
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is definitely a worthy resolve

1091
02:03:36,161 --> 02:03:37,402
[SPEAKER_06]: and I support it wholeheartedly.

1092
02:03:37,962 --> 02:03:38,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1093
02:03:39,263 --> 02:03:40,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1094
02:03:42,105 --> 02:03:43,185

02:03:48,909 --> 02:03:49,689

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Night?

1099
02:03:51,631 --> 02:03:51,811
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1100
02:03:52,811 --> 02:03:53,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Long and Kern?

1101
02:03:53,652 --> 02:03:53,792

02:03:54,632 --> 02:03:55,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Marks?

1103
02:03:56,093 --> 02:03:56,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1104
02:03:56,954 --> 02:03:57,774

02:03:57,874 --> 02:03:58,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1106
02:03:59,015 --> 02:03:59,695
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caviello?

1107
02:03:59,996 --> 02:04:00,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1108
02:04:02,618 --> 02:04:04,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

02:04:38,972 --> 02:04:41,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1115
02:04:41,454 --> 02:04:44,116
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's a tough, that's a tough word.

1116
02:04:45,457 --> 02:04:47,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to put this forward.

1117
02:04:47,138 --> 02:05:00,910
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like every, every few months where I congratulate Brittany Lanzilli or somebody from the Lanzilli family, but I don't think it can, cannot be done because of the accomplishments that she's achieved in her, at her young age.

1118
02:05:01,484 --> 02:05:08,607
[SPEAKER_01]: She was one of the original families that helped start a girls hockey team at the high school.

1119
02:05:08,627 --> 02:05:11,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And ever since, her career has just taken off.

1120
02:05:11,869 --> 02:05:14,370
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're so proud to have her here in Medford.

1121
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:16,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to congratulate her on all her accomplishments.

1122
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:23,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's led the way for female athletes in general, but young female hockey players.

1123
02:05:23,295 --> 02:05:24,655
[SPEAKER_01]: She's their role model.

1124
02:05:26,950 --> 02:05:35,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just, it's just wonderful to see her at the, in the front page of the sports section of the Medford transcript and read about her on a, I mean monthly basis.

1125
02:05:35,633 --> 02:05:40,755
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to congratulate her and her family and just wonderful work.

1126
02:05:41,595 --> 02:05:42,376

1128
02:05:47,838 --> 02:05:51,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Brittany's, uh, been a superstar and, uh, she should be celebrated.

1129
02:05:51,659 --> 02:05:54,620
[SPEAKER_11]: So I, uh, appreciate this, um,

1130
02:05:55,812 --> 02:06:02,834
[SPEAKER_11]: this resolution, but I wanted to mention that I believe her father, Kenny, is now an ambassador in Kazakhstan.

1131
02:06:03,834 --> 02:06:10,215
[SPEAKER_11]: He's made such an impact in that country, I believe they want him to come back, and he's just an amazing person.

1132
02:06:10,255 --> 02:06:11,896
[SPEAKER_11]: So, congratulations.

1133
02:06:12,656 --> 02:06:13,136
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1134
02:06:13,156 --> 02:06:14,176

[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to congratulate the Lanzilli family as well.

1138
02:06:21,752 --> 02:06:37,762
[SPEAKER_13]: that we've had Brittany up here a number of times now, from her days playing at Medford High, where she was a top goal scorer, to her All-Scholastic selection two years in a row, now to her placement on the World National Team, and now coming back home with her bronze medal.

1139
02:06:37,782 --> 02:06:41,285
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Mr. President, it's great to have someone in this community that so many people can look up to.

1140
02:06:41,845 --> 02:06:44,047
[SPEAKER_13]: She comes from a great family, and I wish her the best of luck.

1141
02:06:44,527 --> 02:06:50,791
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to thank her for representing Medford, Mass., and the United States of America with dignity and pride overseas, Mr. President.

1142
02:06:51,756 --> 02:06:52,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Counselor.

1143
02:06:52,496 --> 02:06:57,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can invite her up here with her bronze medal for a citation in the near future.

[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, when she's back in summertime, if we can invite her up here, it would be nice, with the bronze medal, it would be nice for everybody to see.

1147
02:07:15,445 --> 02:07:15,865
[SPEAKER_03]: And her dad.
