1
00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:07,840
It's a shell that, when it bursts in the sky, it has 35 of these gold-glittering comets in them.

2
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:16,170
And the glitter kind of looks like if you ground up 18-karat gold and pixie-dusted it into the sky, and it twinkles when it descends.

3
00:00:17,572 --> 00:00:21,154
It ignites the burst charge at its full apex up in the sky.

4
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:24,476
That burst charge also ignites the stars.

5
00:00:25,077 --> 00:00:35,663
And just as you think that the comet is going to extinguish and go out, it then splits again and it creates this dust effect at the tail end of the burn.

6
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:40,667
It's something that's special to me and also the rest of the family when you see that shell.

7
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,129
It's also a tribute and a remembrance of my dad.

8
00:00:49,942 --> 00:00:55,709
Jimmy Guzzi once told me about making fireworks, that an accident was always vaguely in the back of the mind.

9
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:01,055
You live with it every day, he told me, sort of like knowing that nuclear weapons are pointed at you.

10
00:01:08,113 --> 00:01:14,916
My second great-grandfather started our business in Bari, Italy in 1850.

11
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:24,299
They immigrated to Ellis Island in the early 1900s and they set up a factory literally six, seven miles from where we're sitting here today on Long Island.

12
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:30,403
And they operated their factory until about the late 1920s, 1929.

13
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:36,408
My grandfather, he opened his own factory in 1929 right in this very village, Bellport Village.

14
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,369
So he had three children.

15
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:42,472
He and my grandmother had three children, which was the fourth generation.

16
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:45,374
And my father was the oldest.

17
00:01:45,434 --> 00:01:48,917
And he was somewhat the innovator at that time.

18
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:52,819
I remember the days of being at Coney Island at five, six years old.

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,162
And it got into my blood.

20
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,443
I mean, I was with my dad.

21
00:01:58,163 --> 00:01:59,044
The show would go off.

22
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:01,806
All the people would come up, clap, you know, tell him, have a great job.

23
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:02,606
And it's addictive.

24
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:14,114
And that, to me, at five years old, the energy, the camaraderie of being with a group of people, the ability to create something and see so many people enjoy it, it's addictive.

25
00:02:14,214 --> 00:02:19,678
And at that time, I knew from as long as I can remember that this is what I wanted to do.

26
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:24,729
And then in 1983, unfortunately, we had the explosion.

27
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,833
On a Saturday of a Thanksgiving weekend, the Gucci's plant exploded.

28
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:34,277
Debris from this blast drifted down on townships 10 miles away.

29
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:42,744
Jimmy Gucci had been working on the big shells he loved to make, big eight-inch color shells, though he was always a bit anxious about them.

30
00:02:44,216 --> 00:02:53,134
He and his cousin, a pretty dark-haired girl who was Jimmy's assistant, were instantly killed only a few feet from the shop where they were working on the big shelves.

31
00:02:54,376 --> 00:02:56,120
Something must have happened in there.

32
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:10,253
We lost everything, you know, we lost two loved ones and lost our entire facilities.

33
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:18,458
There was a lot of activity, there was a lot of shoes to fill, there was a lot of space to fill because there was a big gap that was caused by losing him.

34
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:23,681
So I kind of took the role of trying to fill his shoes and still am trying to fill his shoes.

35
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:31,165
Good morning, fireworks by Gritchy.

36
00:03:33,325 --> 00:03:35,966
Favorite firework would be a brocade Camaro.

37
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:43,228
It's a large, breaking, big willow type Camaro that would descend all the way down to the ground.

38
00:03:44,108 --> 00:03:47,790
And with the music and a large volley of them, it just fills the sky.

39
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:48,670
It's a beautiful show.

40
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,871
I like the spectacle of the Niagara Falls.

41
00:03:52,191 --> 00:04:05,697
You know, you have some pictures around here that you'll see the Niagara Falls coming off the entire bottom part of the Brooklyn Bridge, from the bottom of the actual bridge itself, hitting the East River down below.

42
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:10,839
So I'll never forget firing that shell, that exact effect.

43
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:14,341
And it still brings shivers up my spine now, thinking about it.

44
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:19,956
I love the giant willow ones.

45
00:04:19,996 --> 00:04:21,959
They're just so pretty when they come down like a waterfall.

46
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,807
It twinkles as it's coming down, and then it slowly dissipates, so it makes it really pretty.

47
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:29,109
Kind of magical, I guess.

48
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:52,828
When somebody asks me what's my occupation, I generally would say we're in the firework entertainment business, as well as manufacturing of explosives business, because the other half of our business, about 50% of our revenue, is in manufacturing of explosives for the Department of Defense.

49
00:04:53,408 --> 00:05:05,052
We make a tremendous amount of training devices, hand grenade simulators, ground bomb simulators, trip flare simulators, and things like that, as well as some components that go into live munitions.

50
00:05:05,893 --> 00:05:12,892
So, I say we're a fireworks performance company as well as a manufacturer for the Department of Defense.

51
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:31,321
This New Year's Eve, we're in the heart of the design process right now.

52
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:41,007
A project of this size has about 40,000 different cues and circuits that have to be initiated over an eight-and-a-half-minute period.

53
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:49,312
Do you get a sense of the aerial drone, but it's still unknown?

54
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:49,612
Sure.

55
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,253
You absolutely have a sense.

56
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:55,576
If everything goes perfectly, what this is going to look like.

57
00:05:56,707 --> 00:06:00,309
But there's always so many variables in a live performance.

58
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:06,931
One, rehearsal, you can't fire this whole show and then look at it and make changes in real time out in the field.

59
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:16,054
So this is the countdown towards the launching of the world record show.

60
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:25,920
So these are digits, sky-etching digits that are fired with a series of comets that are fired in a very tight pattern to create the digits.

61
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,162
Now you notice it's not one digit every second.

62
00:06:29,742 --> 00:06:32,424
It's slow in the beginning, but now you'll see it picks up.

63
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:38,227
And it's intended to be very quiet as far as nothing in the sky.

64
00:06:40,174 --> 00:06:41,956
And then you'll see this long tail.

65
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:43,577
This is the launching of the shell now.

66
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:45,019
You see this long tail.

67
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,720
The music will be playing also with it.

68
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:59,212
And then when it reaches its apex... Now each one of these...

69
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:07,691
These small trails will be one 5-inch in diameter, 5-pound comet that's loaded inside of the shell.

70
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:11,673
And it's designed to burn long enough for it to come all the way down to the water.

71
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:13,434
So when you see that...

72
00:18:30,422 --> 00:18:31,683
Lawrence LaPore.

73
00:18:32,304 --> 00:18:32,744
LaPore.

74
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:35,867
Councilor DelaRusso has nominated Lawrence LaPore.

75
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:37,008
Any further nominations?

76
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,810
Motion to close the nominations, Mr. Clerk.

77
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,072
Councilor Knight has closed the nominations.

78
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:44,814
Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

79
00:18:47,397 --> 00:18:48,477
I present DelaRusso.

80
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:49,779
Lawrence LaPore.

81
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:50,779
Councilor Franco.

82
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,081
Lawrence LaPore.

83
00:18:52,941 --> 00:18:53,682
Councilor Knight.

Lawrence LaPore.

85
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:55,764
Councilor Burnett.

86
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:56,905
Lawrence LaPore.

87
00:18:57,405 --> 00:18:58,046
Councilor Marks.

88
00:18:59,201 --> 00:18:59,982
Lawrence Lapore.

89
00:19:00,002 --> 00:19:02,244
7 in the affirmative for Lawrence Lapore.

90
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:02,944
Congratulations.

91
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:49,977
to rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of the Commonwealth, and the ordinances of the City of Memphis.

92
00:19:50,017 --> 00:19:50,578
Congratulations.

93
00:19:50,618 --> 00:19:52,200
You want to say a few words now?

94
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:07,250
All right, the chair declares a quick recess at what time is it?

95
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:07,770
It's 7.10?

96
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:09,211
Okay.

97
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,252
We'll reconvene with the gradual chair.

98
00:20:27,944 --> 00:20:30,066
I thought he thank you.

99
00:20:30,126 --> 00:20:31,727
He's gonna late night tomorrow.

100
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:05,922
I stood straight up the whole time.

101
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:06,808
It was so cool.

102
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:31,791
C. We thought that the.

103
00:21:32,752 --> 00:21:33,512
We first.

104
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,452
It's a race.

105
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:36,893
I think eleven maybe early.

106
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:37,193
No way.

107
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:09,277
Michael.

108
00:22:43,634 --> 00:22:44,795
Yeah, I started What

109
00:23:12,838 --> 00:23:17,121
I know you're after bus stops, you're after bus stops for sure.

110
00:23:53,228 --> 00:23:54,349
Motion to reconvene.

111
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,651
All right, everybody.

112
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:58,212
Good evening, everyone.

113
00:23:58,232 --> 00:24:12,324
18004, offered by Councilor DelaRusso, be it resolved that the standing committee rules be adopted as the standing rules of the City Council insofar as they are applicable.

114
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:13,284

115
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:15,266
Vice President DelaRusso.

116
00:24:15,426 --> 00:24:16,787
Move approval, Mr. President.

117
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:17,328

motions orders and resolutions 18 zero zero six up by councillor mox Be it resolved that the best that the city of method recognized long time public servant and 30-year veteran of the school committee leader the giant amaso for her dedication in commitment to the children of our community councillor mox

132
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:29,672
Thank you, Mr. President, and it's with great honor and great pride that I rise tonight to honor, in my opinion, someone that has done so much for this community, not only in the capacity as a member of the school committee for three decades,

133
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:47,868
but also as someone very involved in many, many organizations throughout the community, and someone very instrumental in leading the path on many, many initiatives in this community, of which I will mention some here tonight, Mr. President.

134
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:55,425
I personally had the opportunity to serve with Lena DiGentimaso for six years as a member of the school committee.

135
00:25:56,186 --> 00:26:02,936
It was my first time elected in this community back some years ago and when I first got on the school board it was

136
00:26:03,557 --> 00:26:04,478
kind of intimidating.

137
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:22,280
I was new to the process, new to the system, and Lena was one of the first people to put her hand out and welcome me to the school committee and really took me under her wing for a period of time.

138
00:26:23,141 --> 00:26:24,261
to show me the ins and outs.

139
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:35,030
And I can remember my first few times being part of the negotiations when we used to have to negotiate with the teachers.

140
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:40,914
And this would be a lengthy six, seven hour night.

141
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:45,077
We used to get in there at five o'clock, no breaks.

142
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:48,040
And you can always count on one thing.

143
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:50,832
and it wasn't to settle the contract.

144
00:26:51,332 --> 00:26:58,757
It was the fact that Lena would cook a homemade lasagna and make sure that everyone was fed.

145
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:00,638
That was the type of person she was.

146
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,140
She was very considerate and always thinking of others.

147
00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:15,508
Her one goal that I found out early as a member of the school committee, she taught me, she said, Mike, no matter what happens,

148
00:27:16,328 --> 00:27:18,790
We're here for the children of this community.

149
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:22,934
We're here to make sure they get the best education possible.

150
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:27,718
And she said, my votes are always predicated on whatever is good for the children.

151
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:36,065
And I learned that early with Lena that she was very dedicated, she was very loyal, and she meant what she said.

152
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:37,746
She didn't go back on her word.

153
00:27:38,126 --> 00:27:43,891
If Lena gave you her word, her word was as good as gold, Mr. President.

154
00:27:45,755 --> 00:28:01,583
You know, another thing too, Lena attended every single meeting, not just with the school committee and other meetings we had, every single function that happened in this community, Lena Degentamaso was part of it.

155
00:28:02,243 --> 00:28:10,467
And I think that says a lot about a person's character and their commitment to doing the job that they're in.

156
00:28:12,204 --> 00:28:15,867
Lena served, like I said, for three decades on the school committee.

157
00:28:16,707 --> 00:28:21,150
Never ran or never intended to run for any other public office.

158
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:25,233
Her commitment was to the kids of this community.

159
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:30,677
Never had any political aspirations other than to helping the kids of this community.

160
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:33,299
And that's what she did for three decades.

161
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,443
Lena was also the longest serving member of the Meffitt School Committee.

162
00:28:40,223 --> 00:28:54,599
She was a strong advocate for the Meffitt Vocational Technical High School back when the school was, to be quite frank with you, lacking the technology and shops

163
00:28:55,339 --> 00:29:03,803
And Lena was one of the key people that stood up back some 20, 25 years ago about improving the vocational school.

164
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:12,026
So she was a leader in that aspect and now we see a school that is really state of the art and one we can all be proud of.

165
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,068
The Curtis Tufts High School.

166
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:31,609
Lena realized early on when that program came about that not every child has the opportunity to go on to college, not every child does well in high school, and this was an opportunity that was given to students that may not get their diploma if the Curtis Tufts did not exist.

167
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:41,714
And you can count on Lena being there at every Thanksgiving meal that they had, and she was a strong advocate of the Curtis Tufts Alternative High School.

168
00:29:42,274 --> 00:29:46,796
She was a big supporter of the fine arts department, in particular the high school band.

169
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:50,538
She was the past president of the Friends of Chevalier.

170
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:53,260
She was instrumental in the building of the new schools.

171
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,382
I served with Lena when we built the new schools.

172
00:29:56,982 --> 00:30:05,788
And if you think that wasn't a tough time, that was a difficult time going from neighborhood schools to having centralized schools.

173
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:12,132
And Lena was one of the educational leaders in this community that led the charge, Mr. President.

174
00:30:13,633 --> 00:30:18,154
She also served with distinction as PTA president for a number of years.

175
00:30:18,855 --> 00:30:26,997
She was selected by the directors of the Mass Association of School Committees, Incorporated, and received the association's Lifetime Achievement Award.

176
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:30,998
Lena received the Woman's Achievement Award from the Human Rights Commission.

177
00:30:31,819 --> 00:30:36,560
She was a recipient of the Tip of the Hat Award from the Salem Street Business Association.

178
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,222
She received the Golden Mustang Award for supporting the students of the Mustang athletic programs.

179
00:30:43,222 --> 00:30:47,007
She was instrumental in the planning and development of the Gene Mack Youth Center.

180
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:57,440
She received the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post-1012 Award in appreciation of leading the charge to have the McGlynn School Auditorium named in honor of the veterans.

181
00:30:58,568 --> 00:31:03,872
She was honored at the Curtis Tufts Alternative High School graduation for many years of continued support.

182
00:31:04,732 --> 00:31:11,076
She received the Tony Lucci Golden Mustang Award for being an outstanding athletic program supporter.

183
00:31:11,657 --> 00:31:15,860
She served as past president of AARP, the method chapter 1132.

184
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:20,762
And the list goes on and on and it really does.

185
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:23,103
And I'm not going to mention everything.

186
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:34,726
I would be remiss at this time because Lena's late husband, Al, as we all know him as affectionately, was a big part of

187
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:54,887
uh, Lena, uh, during the years that I served with her on the school committee, and he was a recognized Purple Heart recipient, uh, from the Korean War, and, uh, along with their three children that were all graduates of Meffitt High School, uh, she raised a beautiful family, Mr. President, along with her role as an advocate

188
00:31:55,467 --> 00:32:03,057
in this community, and not just with the schools, with many, many organizations that I mentioned here tonight.

189
00:32:03,918 --> 00:32:12,929
And it is with great pride, Mr. President, that I offer this resolution to Lena as an outstanding member of the school committee.

190
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:24,232
and I can attest to that, serving with her for six years, but also an outstanding member of this community and, in my opinion, a very, very good friend to many people in this community.

191
00:32:24,912 --> 00:32:40,975
And I would ask, as a resolution here tonight, that the school department dedicate, in her honor, something within the public schools to show the appreciation of her service, 30 years of service,

192
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:53,522
One quick story I remember when I first got on the school board, when we were looking to do the new schools, they invited the school committee to go around to the buildings to see the condition of the buildings.

193
00:32:54,162 --> 00:33:07,090
And I'll never forget some of the meetings I attended and some of the buildings we went in, seeing Lena climb up to the roof of the Franklin School was quite an interesting sight.

194
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:19,018
And it was one of the many things that she took her job so serious, she could have easily said I'm not interested in going to the roof of this old rickety building and standing on the top of the roof.

195
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:23,121
And there wasn't a staircase leading up there, by the way, it was a ladder.

196
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:34,930
And she found it in herself to get up there because that's how interested she was and how dedicated she was to making sure that her vote was predicated on

197
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,892
doing the right thing, and making sure that she had first-hand knowledge.

198
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:43,695
And I learned a lot from her in that spirit of time that I served with her.

199
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:55,341
And I would ask that something be named, Mr. President, with the school department, to honor Lina DeGentimaso for her three decades of service to this community.

200
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:56,141
Outstanding.

201
00:33:56,161 --> 00:34:04,666
I, for one, I've known Lina since I was probably 13, 14 years old in Upper House many times, because I was very friendly with her daughter.

202
00:34:05,486 --> 00:34:09,409
And good woman, I still see her occasionally.

203
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:14,852
And remember, Lena worked at the hilltop.

204
00:34:15,492 --> 00:34:17,113
He never waited in line when Lena was working.

205
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:21,196
He always went in and saw Lena, and she got you right in.

206
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:24,458
Those were the old days when you had to wait for days to get in.

207
00:34:24,478 --> 00:34:26,759
On the motion.

208
00:34:26,819 --> 00:34:29,741
I think we have a few people, Mr. President, that would like to say anything further.

209
00:34:40,198 --> 00:34:41,341
Name and address of the record please.

210
00:34:42,724 --> 00:34:44,628
Figure it might sound.

211
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:45,550
They might sell.

212
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:57,470
First of all, congratulations, President Caviello and Vice President De La Rosa.

213
00:34:58,411 --> 00:34:59,871
And Happy New Year to all of you.

214
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:07,896
I had the pleasure of working with Lena on many, many community projects.

215
00:35:08,876 --> 00:35:16,980
As Councilor Mark said, if there was something happening in the city, you can be sure that Lena was gonna be involved in that.

216
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:20,202
And although she has

217
00:35:22,088 --> 00:35:28,578
over time received quite a lot of significant recognitions.

218
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,987
I wholeheartedly support your proposal and I think one of the

219
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:47,254
most prestigious awards that she received was from the Massachusetts Association of School Committee when she was given the Lifetime Achievement Award.

220
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:52,376
I don't believe any other person in this city ever was honored.

221
00:35:53,777 --> 00:36:04,762
And also, I believe she was the first woman, now that women are in the newspapers these days, she was the first woman to receive the Golden Mustang Award.

222
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:22,364
And my working with her very, very closely during the founding and development of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gym, Lena was just amazing.

223
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:29,687
I mean, if she decided she was going to do something, she was actually the driving force behind our fundraising efforts.

224
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:41,352
And over the years, I would say, I know for a fact, that's where she headed that up, every one of the fundraisers were hugely successful.

225
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:50,976
And without a doubt, she raised in excess of $100,000 through the fundraising campaigns.

226
00:36:51,596 --> 00:36:53,377
And all of that money was given

227
00:36:56,592 --> 00:37:00,815
She raised over $100,000 for both the theater and the Boys and Girls Club.

228
00:37:02,036 --> 00:37:05,938
And all of that money has been given to those operations.

229
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:12,643
So City of Medford can be very, very proud that Lena was a part of us.

230
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:18,786
And I certainly, as I say, I certainly would

231
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:26,241
like to see something happen to give her an honor from the city.

232
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:27,542
Thank you.

233
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:42,813
I also was contacted today by some friends who worked alongside of Lena and myself and that couple was Bruce and Amy Folk.

234
00:37:44,004 --> 00:37:49,285
They are currently in the process of moving from Cotting Street to Melrose.

235
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:55,807
But she sent me an email and asked me if I would read this on her behalf.

236
00:37:57,787 --> 00:38:01,168
Bruce and I have known Lena DiGiandomaso for many, many years.

237
00:38:02,108 --> 00:38:06,749
First got to know her through the Friends of Chevalier and GMAC Gymnasium.

238
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:11,490
We worked together on various committees and many fundraising ventures.

239
00:38:12,478 --> 00:38:19,887
Lena's dedication and devotion to the City of Medford and the young people of the City is a tribute for us all.

240
00:38:21,148 --> 00:38:25,494
Her strength, her enthusiasm, her hard work, her eagerness,

241
00:38:26,693 --> 00:38:31,356
always to be there whenever anything or anyone had a question or needed anything.

242
00:38:32,016 --> 00:38:35,459
Lena would always be there to listen and help whenever possible.

243
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:43,884
Lena always insisted on doing and getting the best for our city of Medford, and especially the young people of the city.

244
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:45,425
Thank you.

245
00:38:53,987 --> 00:39:13,007
I along with Michael had the honor and privilege of serving with Lena on the school committee and I think one of her greatest accomplishments was when we decided to beef up the vocational school and do a few things that were unconventional at the time.

246
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,289
I said to Lena, why don't we see if we can institute a culinary arts program?

247
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:23,391
And through a lot of arm bending and work behind the scenes, it became a fruition.

248
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:33,755
And just last month, Council, you and I had the opportunity to see what that program, how it started, and where it is today with their brand new cafeteria.

249
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:40,477
Lena and I were fortunate enough in 2010 to be granted life membership in the Mass Association of School Committees.

250
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:49,843
And during my tenure on the school board, I think there was no person that offered more help, more insight, and had some great ideas.

251
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:53,706
And like people have said, she was always there for the kids.

252
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:57,809
That was her first priority, even long after her own children were gone from Medford High.

253
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:08,095
and I would hope that you would pass this on to the new school committee and see that they act with due diligence and name something respectfully after Mr. DeGentomaso.

254
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:08,875
Thank you.

255
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:22,604
for your years of service to the children, similar to Lena, over 26 years of service, Mr. Skerry?

256
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:23,565
Yes.

257
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:28,749
As a school committee, I thank you for your years of dedication to the children of the Memphis office.

258
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:31,411
I'm just wondering where the time went.

259
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:41,238
On a lighter note, when I first ran for the school board back in 1985, Lena and I were battling out for the sixth seat on the school board.

260
00:40:41,658 --> 00:40:43,360
Election night, I won by one vote.

261
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,140
She had a recount.

262
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,581
I ended up losing by one vote.

263
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:51,542
Came back the following time, was elected, and I had a great run.

264
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:54,062
Best to you all.

265
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:59,044
It was a pleasure serving with Michael and all my former colleagues.

266
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,564
I wish Mrs. DeGentimaso well.

267
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:01,824
Thank you.

268
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:11,212
Good evening.

269
00:41:11,232 --> 00:41:12,073
Name and address of the record, please.

270
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:12,474
Thank you.

271
00:41:12,574 --> 00:41:14,836
Ken Crouch, 50 Mystic Street.

272
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:18,019
I'm a member of the board of directors of the Friends of Chevalier.

273
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:26,306
I got to know Lita when I started to get involved with the Friends, probably around 2004 or so.

274
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:31,371
And it's been a few years since she stepped down from her active role with the Friends.

275
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:41,577
Also the school committee, but it's never too late to say thank you to somebody for all their contributions to the community.

276
00:41:41,997 --> 00:41:44,799
And I think it's especially fitting this year for a couple of reasons.

277
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:50,302
One is the 25th anniversary, 2018, of the founding of the Friends of Chevalier.

278
00:41:52,298 --> 00:41:54,821
As was mentioned, Lena had an important role.

279
00:41:54,841 --> 00:42:04,209
I don't know if she was a founding member, probably was, but very instrumental in bringing the theater back from a condition that was, you know,

280
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:14,046
deplorable and perhaps, you know, in jeopardy of the theater remaining as a viable venue.

281
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:16,948
And, you know, look where it is today.

282
00:42:18,109 --> 00:42:26,415
You know, she was an advocate for the city to invest in the building, well, to save the building, first of all, and also invest in the building.

283
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:39,431
For the state legislature to approve significant funding for the renovations and was instrumental in the fundraising on behalf of the Friends as well.

284
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:45,539
So, you know, she really believed in the theater and its viability as a

285
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:56,828
venue that would bring economic vitality to the community and be a place for outstanding performances for the arts.

286
00:42:58,149 --> 00:43:08,137
So working hand-in-hand with the commission, they brought really Chevalier to the point where we see what's happening with it today.

287
00:43:08,538 --> 00:43:12,581
You know, a lot of the naysayers said, oh, it's too big to be successful.

288
00:43:14,242 --> 00:43:19,224
No company would ever come in here and run it without, you know, being paid a fortune.

289
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:25,106
And no company would ever come in and essentially pay the city for the opportunity to use this venue.

290
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,306
And look what's happened.

291
00:43:26,706 --> 00:43:31,908
Bill Blumenreich presents, entered into an agreement with the city this fall and is investing

292
00:43:32,708 --> 00:43:48,332
his own money, putting in a sound system, putting in new lighting, putting in new box office facilities, improving the sight lines, putting up money to bring in top-notch shows that are selling out this theater.

293
00:43:48,372 --> 00:43:54,693
Today, the fifth performance was added for comedian Gabriel Iglesias in February.

294
00:43:55,093 --> 00:43:59,575
So there are numerous shows that have already sold out and additional shows have been added.

295
00:44:01,475 --> 00:44:11,882
The work of people like Lena, others on the Friends, others on the commission, really brought the theater to the point where it was able to take this leap to the next level.

296
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:16,386
And I support whatever could be done.

297
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:34,654
to recognize Lena, particularly something at the school, and not only to thank her, but if there's something visible at the school, I think it would inspire future generations of public servants that will learn about Lena and what she contributed to the community when they pass through those halls.

298
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:35,454
So, thank you.

299
00:44:43,677 --> 00:44:45,878
On the motion by Councilor Mox.

300
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:47,079
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

301
00:44:47,379 --> 00:44:48,079
Seconded by.

Councilor DelaRusso.

303
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,001
By Councilor DelaRusso.

304
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:52,942
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

305
00:44:57,784 --> 00:44:58,925

Councilor Falcone.

308
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:02,207
Yes.

309
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:03,310
motion passes.

310
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:09,592
Motion by counselor night to suspend the rule seconded by council Scott Kelly also favor.

311
00:45:38,057 --> 00:45:42,700
Did Mr. President see the president motion to waive a reading of the paper and have a brief synopsis given by the president?

312
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:48,023
On the motion by counselor night for a brief synopsis in it.

313
00:45:51,425 --> 00:45:52,766
Maybe name and address of the record, please.

314
00:45:52,966 --> 00:45:53,826
Good evening, counselors.

315
00:45:53,846 --> 00:45:56,288
Alicia Nellie Benjamin, finance director for the city of Medford.

316
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:01,171
Roberta Cameron, chairman of the Community Preservation Committee.

317
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,321
Daniel Evans, Community Preservation Coordinator.

318
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:08,161
Thank you.

319
00:46:09,702 --> 00:46:10,502
Okay, who wants to go first?

320
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:11,963
Okay, I'll go first.

321
00:46:11,983 --> 00:46:13,003
Okay.

322
00:46:13,063 --> 00:46:17,465
Paper 18-010 is actually the fiscal year 17 revenues.

323
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:29,009
I know the council did vote fiscal year 18, but you didn't get to see fiscal year 17, as that was our first year, so I automatically had to reserve it, and then it had to go through DOR before it could be appropriated.

324
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:30,070
That's what this paper's for.

325
00:46:34,352 --> 00:46:52,985
Thank you, the purpose for this is to reserve the minimum 10% as is required under the CPA legislation in each of the program areas, and the remaining balance is to be, can be appropriated for any of the program areas.

326
00:46:54,466 --> 00:46:54,826
Thank you.

327
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:58,549
Do you want to speak?

328
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:00,190
Do you have anything to add?

329
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:14,048
Mr. President, so it's my understanding that annually 10% needs to be appropriated to each program area where the CPA was up and running, but our ordinance wasn't in place until a little bit later on in the year.

330
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:20,831
I believe what happened is we were able to address fiscal year 18, but fiscal year 17 money was not appropriated.

331
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:25,873
So it's my understanding that by approving this appropriation will be in compliance with the community preservation.

332
00:47:28,397 --> 00:47:29,959
On the motion by Councilor Nays.

333
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:33,702
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

334
00:47:34,803 --> 00:47:36,384
All those in favor, we'll call vote.

335
00:47:36,925 --> 00:47:38,286
Mr. Clerk, roll call vote, please.

00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,809
Yes.

338
00:47:42,369 --> 00:47:43,010
Councilor Falco.

339
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,410
Yes.

340
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,451
Councilor Nays.

341
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:44,811
Yes.

342
00:47:45,412 --> 00:47:46,193
Councilor Long-Term.

343
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:46,453
Yes.

344
00:47:46,893 --> 00:47:47,514
Councilor Maxwell.

345
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:47,994
Yes.

346
00:47:48,435 --> 00:47:49,215
Councilor Scott-Billings.

347
00:47:49,275 --> 00:47:49,536
Yes.

348
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:50,737
President Campbell.

349
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:51,037
Yes.

350
00:47:52,218 --> 00:47:54,940
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

351
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:55,541
Thank you.

352
00:47:56,815 --> 00:47:58,036
We're under suspension, Mr. President.

353
00:47:58,076 --> 00:48:03,421
We have paper 18-011 also on the table.

354
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:13,830
18-011, dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request that you and your Honorable body approve the recommendations of the community preservation committee to appropriate up to

355
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:37,335
$300,000 from the Community Preservation Act funds for the purpose of funding phase one of the Harris Park Rehabilitation Project in order to meet the deadline for committing the matching funds for the anticipated federal land and water conservation grant and is identified in the community preservation plan as a high priority recreation project.

356
00:48:38,236 --> 00:48:42,557
This appropriation will be allocated to the open space category in the amount of $100,000.

357
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:50,700
$23,281 and funded from the General Reserve category in the amount of $176,719.

358
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,362
This project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund.

359
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:06,905
Roberta Cameron, Chair of the Community Preservation Committee, and Daniel Evans, Community Preservation Coordinator, are present to answer any questions that we may have.

360
00:49:08,826 --> 00:49:09,806
Name and address for the record again.

361
00:49:09,826 --> 00:49:12,267
Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

362
00:49:16,473 --> 00:49:18,440
Daniel Evans Community Preservation Coordinator.

363
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,745
Thank you.

364
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:29,157
Any questions?

365
00:49:29,177 --> 00:49:46,991
So the Office of Community Development submitted a request for us to consider an off-cycle application for a project to match a federal grant rehabilitating Harris Park.

366
00:49:47,832 --> 00:50:07,528
And their purpose for the off-cycle application was because the OCD anticipates that the city will have to commit the funding to complete the project during the month of January at some point.

367
00:50:08,189 --> 00:50:15,555
So imminently, the city is going to have to commit the resources in order to be able to accept the federal grant.

368
00:50:16,395 --> 00:50:24,522
So the community preservation funds would have to be committed before any other city funds could be committed to the project.

369
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:32,990
So they asked us if we would support the use of community preservation funds for this project.

370
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:52,147
We felt that the project, so the community preservation application process allows for an off-cycle applicant where it is a high-priority project that has a substantial purpose for urgency that needs to be considered outside of this cycle.

371
00:50:52,827 --> 00:51:09,513
And we felt that this proposal, this request, met both of those criteria, that there's a reason why the funds would need to be committed before we consider the other applications in the pipeline, and this is a high-priority project.

372
00:51:09,913 --> 00:51:31,322
According to the plan that we carried out over the past six, seven months, we identified community needs through a public process, through coordinating with various departments and boards and committees and community organizations to get input about what the needs are.

373
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:37,244
And some of the goals and priorities that were identified were to

374
00:51:38,985 --> 00:52:04,833
commit funds to serve underserved neighborhoods and populations, which this proposal does, to leverage funding from other sources, which this proposal does, to, I don't have all of the goals, but we had given previously when we came to the city council a summary of our goals and recommendations

375
00:52:06,754 --> 00:52:13,177
or the goals and priorities that we identified in our process, and specifically pertaining to open space and recreation.

376
00:52:13,677 --> 00:52:21,401
Improving access to open space and recreation resources and providing diverse recreation opportunities, serving residents of all ages.

377
00:52:21,421 --> 00:52:22,841
So this project...

378
00:52:24,762 --> 00:52:35,768
fulfills our goals and the priority to improve access, safety, and function of our existing recreation resources, which this project does.

379
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:44,614
So we felt that this project meets the criteria to be considered a high priority for CPA funding.

380
00:52:46,834 --> 00:52:55,236
The amount of city match that was requested, I believe was $516,000 to match a federal grant of $300,000.

381
00:52:56,116 --> 00:53:12,180
And given the fact that this is coming before we've had the opportunity to see what other projects are in the pipeline, we wanted to be conservative in the amount of CPA funds that we committed to the project.

382
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,181
So we elected to match the federal grant

383
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:24,635
and ask that the city find funding from other sources to match the remainder of the needs for this project.

384
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:26,397
And that represents

385
00:53:29,243 --> 00:53:47,230
We're only for the first round of funding That we intend to recommend in May to the City Council We are looking at the FY 17 revenues that that you've just approved the reserving

386
00:53:49,091 --> 00:53:50,472
the program areas for.

387
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:53,975
That's $1.2 million in total funding.

388
00:53:54,635 --> 00:54:02,302
So to evenly allocate that funding between each of the three program areas would be about $400,000 for each program area.

389
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:08,266
So our offering or recommending $300,000 toward open space and recreation for this project

390
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:26,100
is still leaves some funding available for other open space and recreation projects and to provide an even amount of funding for the three program areas altogether.

391
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:32,044
So that's a long synopsis of how we got to make this recommendation.

392
00:54:32,584 --> 00:54:32,924
Thank you.

393
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:33,485
Thank you.

394
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:36,107
Daniel, Mr. President.

395
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:37,839
Do you want to say anything?

396
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:38,779
No, she pretty much covered it.

397
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:57,111
But I just wanted to add that about the equal distribution of the funding, I think based on the forms, the eligibility determination forms that we've received, I believe that it's not going to be very heavy on the recreation open space projects.

398
00:54:57,531 --> 00:55:06,277
So I do think that there will be price-efficient funds to go around for any recreation open space projects that were coming down the pipeline.

399
00:55:07,355 --> 00:55:08,676
as well as to fund this at $300,000.

400
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:20,867
Mr. President, I think that the intricacies and the inner workings of the CPA are very interesting, but people, if we're going to be spending $300,000, want to know what that $300,000 is going to go for.

401
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:26,352
In our packet, we have a letter from our economic development planner, Clodagh Stoker-Long,

402
00:55:27,673 --> 00:55:31,834
And this is a two-phase project, Mr. President, to rehabilitate Harris Park.

403
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:45,779
And phase one will include new play equipment for children ages two to five and five to 12, a rope climber, a water play area, a nature play area or a swing alley, a community garden, site furnishings, plantings and signage, and accessible parking improvements.

404
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:54,481
Phase two will involve the rehabilitation of the fields to provide a new softball field, space for three junior soccer fields, an area for a farmer's market or a similar community use.

405
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:56,262
It will also include a rain garden,

406
00:55:56,722 --> 00:56:01,206
and additional accessibility improvements and streetage improvements and plannings along the edge of Middlesex Avenue.

407
00:56:01,966 --> 00:56:07,251
Mr. President says here that the total cost of phase one, including design and construction and construction oversight is estimated at about $817,000.

408
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:10,073
The $300,000 which would be reimbursable through the Land Water Conservation Fund.

409
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:29,895
And it looks like, Mr. President, if in fact this appropriation is made this evening, there'll be a $217,000 balance to complete the requirements of phase one of the project, and the city will continue to seek land and water APOC grants to fund.

410
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:31,676
Phase two of the project.

411
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:42,219
Mr. President seems like it's a quite an endeavor, but having been down Harris Park all fall long My kid being enrolled in soccer for the first time in his life It's a park that needs a little bit of TLC.

412
00:56:42,259 --> 00:56:54,224
It needs a little bit of love and it's a I think a highly trafficked park Mr. President actually has a lot more access and a lot more involvement down there than most of the other parks that we see in the community so on this is an endeavor that I think needs to be

413
00:56:55,084 --> 00:56:59,066
examined thoroughly, but it's certainly a worthwhile cause, Mr. President.

414
00:56:59,086 --> 00:57:00,447
So with that being said, I rest.

415
00:57:02,248 --> 00:57:03,028
Councilor Kern.

416
00:57:03,388 --> 00:57:03,728
Thank you.

417
00:57:03,748 --> 00:57:04,829
I'm President Carviello.

418
00:57:05,229 --> 00:57:06,170
Thank you for your hard work.

419
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:16,014
I don't know if my questions are for you or for the city, but with regards to the 300,000 that potentially will be used from CPA, is there a certain match?

420
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:18,996
What's the percentage of the match for the grant?

421
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:33,342
The land and water grant is $300,000, so the committee elected to recommend that CPA funds match the land and water grant one-to-one, so to match $300,000 for the land and water grant.

422
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,107
So how are we going to be paying?

423
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:48,411
This isn't a question for the CPA, but for the $217,000, what is our plan?

424
00:57:48,611 --> 00:57:49,791
I think maybe the city.

425
00:57:50,532 --> 00:57:51,132
I don't have it in.

426
00:57:52,313 --> 00:57:53,433
I may close.

427
00:57:53,453 --> 00:57:54,154
Thank you.

428
00:57:54,454 --> 00:57:55,594
Office of Community Development.

429
00:57:59,212 --> 00:58:01,874
I will give you a direct answer and then I will go backwards.

430
00:58:02,634 --> 00:58:08,618
I spoke to the mayor today about how we would look to fund the balance of $217,000.

431
00:58:10,879 --> 00:58:26,688
When we get the official confirmation from, we get it through the state of the land and water funding, we will come to you like we come again and again with a presentation asking you to accept the funding, accept the grant and to appropriate the funds

432
00:58:27,488 --> 00:58:28,949
the whole lot of the funds for the park.

433
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:34,873
That's the way these grant systems work.

434
00:58:35,154 --> 00:58:39,236
At that time, we will ask you to appropriate the additional $217,000.

435
00:58:39,276 --> 00:58:50,464
I spoke to the mayor today and she said it's very likely that we will ask you to appropriate that from free cash.

436
00:58:50,785 --> 00:58:52,566
That isn't definite, but that's what she said is likely.

437
00:58:55,156 --> 00:59:03,944
So either bond or free cash, is there a potential that we'll request part of the next funding from CPA to put in another application?

438
00:59:03,964 --> 00:59:09,408
Is that a possibility?

439
00:59:09,848 --> 00:59:17,395
Yes, I would anticipate that this is a source of funds for open space and I would anticipate that generally we will ask CPA to help.

440
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,314
with important recreational projects.

441
00:59:33,211 --> 00:59:36,834
The open space plan is due to be updated.

442
00:59:48,842 --> 00:59:49,742
It's been five years.

443
00:59:49,762 --> 00:59:52,823
It's actually now seven, but we've gotten to the seventh.

444
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:56,464
So by August of this year, we need to have a new open space plan.

445
00:59:56,644 --> 01:00:06,687
So we need to do the whole process of information gathering and getting goals and objectives, as well as assessing the value, the state of the various parks.

446
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:11,071
create a new list of priorities.

447
01:00:11,112 --> 01:00:17,200
We usually just move down to the priorities that are set by that planning process.

448
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:23,770
And of course the CPA has also done their own planning process, which in fact, obviously the people say the same things.

449
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:32,033
So very often the priorities in the open space plan are quite like those in the community preservation plan.

450
01:00:32,653 --> 01:00:50,198
But the city would be applying for any parks that are city owned, the city would be applying for the CPA and we don't have any plans in the next year or two besides Harris Park phase one and phase two until we do the open space assessment in August, which isn't going to really lead into if there's another park that's

451
01:00:51,442 --> 01:00:57,024
designated as needing rehab, that would not even be until the 2019 cycle.

452
01:00:57,384 --> 01:01:05,466
So potentially we could put an application for the CPA funds for the second cycle.

453
01:01:12,786 --> 01:01:15,907
I think this is definitely a project that needs to be done.

454
01:01:15,947 --> 01:01:19,828
This is exactly where I envision CPA monies going.

455
01:01:19,848 --> 01:01:29,672
My question, putting this project aside, is how did the vote go down with regards to taking something out of cycle?

456
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:41,854
Our committee members voted, I believe there were eight people present at our previous meeting, all but one.

457
01:01:42,294 --> 01:01:47,899
And there was one person who voted in the negative, everyone else voted for it.

458
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:54,744
And his concerns were about taking this out of order, not, he felt that this was a good project, but

459
01:01:55,985 --> 01:02:02,388
felt uncomfortable with the very first project that we do being taken out of order or being accelerated.

460
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:08,392
Felt that if the timing were otherwise, he would get behind it very easily.

461
01:02:09,032 --> 01:02:18,777
So that was a difficult decision for the committee to wrap our heads around because we want to maintain the appearance that this funding is available for anybody in the community who needs it.

462
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:28,043
and that's what drove us to find an amount that we felt comfortable with leaving funds available for other applicants.

463
01:02:28,524 --> 01:02:37,830
So can you tell the council when was the application given to the committee originally, and was a full application provided from the city?

464
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,352
Yes, we had a full application received by CLODA.

465
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:42,653
And when was that?

466
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:43,834
The 19th?

467
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,051
It must have been the 19th.

468
01:02:47,251 --> 01:02:47,431
Yes.

469
01:02:47,612 --> 01:02:48,012
Oh, really?

470
01:02:48,072 --> 01:02:48,952
So very recently.

471
01:02:48,992 --> 01:02:49,353
Yes.

472
01:02:50,694 --> 01:02:56,778
And that's time-wise because this application for the grant is due?

473
01:02:57,238 --> 01:03:01,581
The grant application that was submitted originally goes through a strange sort of process.

474
01:03:02,081 --> 01:03:05,584
Submitted to the state, who decide whether they're going to support it or not.

475
01:03:06,044 --> 01:03:08,085
And then they send it to the National Park Service.

476
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:11,328
And the state, so it was submitted to the state last February.

477
01:03:12,228 --> 01:03:19,973
They decided by about, let me say, August 2 to submit it to the National Park Service with a recommendation to fund it.

478
01:03:20,413 --> 01:03:26,776
And they tell us that they're 99% sure that we will refund it, that they have never been turned down.

479
01:03:26,797 --> 01:03:27,797
Of course you can't, no.

480
01:03:27,857 --> 01:03:30,399
It's in your hands, not mine.

481
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:40,905
I expect in the next month, I can't forget, absolutely not, to get a letter saying, congratulations, you've been awarded the funding, now please go to the council and get your acceptance

482
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:42,546
Sure, yeah.

483
01:04:08,823 --> 01:04:11,506
I think I understand why you had one in the negative.

484
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:16,750
So it is a difficult decision, but I think this obviously needs to be done.

485
01:04:16,830 --> 01:04:28,922
So it's a hard vote, obviously, for the committee, I think, is ultimately the ones that are doing all the work and putting their time and effort and sweat and tears into how much you do is commendable.

486
01:04:29,522 --> 01:04:30,663
I see an issue with

487
01:04:31,804 --> 01:04:38,107
Taking applications out of order, but I you know, I see both sides I just want to I want to just voice that concern.

488
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:49,452
Yeah doing that often I don't I want to make sure that even though we have so, you know, two million come very very soon in this fund I just feel like everybody should have a fair shot.

489
01:04:49,492 --> 01:04:58,917
It should be obviously I asked for an extension on the application process and I just think we're walking a fine line and I hope hopefully

490
01:05:00,959 --> 01:05:18,940
I appreciate that and it is also I think important to have as we wrote in the application process the opportunity for applicants to come in off cycle as this application was because there are opportunities that will be very important

491
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:20,702
down the line.

492
01:05:21,922 --> 01:05:41,793
Meeting a grant cycle is one example of the kind of project that might not align with what our timeline is, and if we wanted to acquire property, perhaps for open space or for affordable housing, property acquisition is often something that needs to be done.

493
01:05:42,653 --> 01:05:45,515
on a very fast timeline that doesn't match.

494
01:05:45,735 --> 01:05:49,578
So there are reasons why that can happen.

495
01:05:50,179 --> 01:05:53,281
It was a little bit uncomfortable that this was our first application.

496
01:05:53,842 --> 01:06:04,449
So even though we anticipated that we were going to need to be able to consider applications out of order, we weighed very carefully this particular one.

497
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:16,355
In my last question, I guess, or point, has the committee discussed, like you just mentioned, a few scenarios where you'd have to take them out of order when you have a grant or you have a land acquisition.

498
01:06:16,395 --> 01:06:21,298
Have you discussed or created a checklist of why you would take

499
01:06:22,998 --> 01:06:26,442
an application out of order, just so it's something to follow.

500
01:06:26,603 --> 01:06:35,192
And when you come back to us next time, we know, oh, you know, you're trying to acquire this piece of land, or there's a grant that needs to be written in time.

501
01:06:35,252 --> 01:06:39,317
I mean, just so we can feel better about this decision as well, confirming your vote.

502
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:57,502
At the moment we have, and perhaps it's a little bit informal and we could improve on the procedure, but we did specify that it should be a high priority project and that there should be a defensible reason why it needs to be considered off-cycle.

503
01:06:57,682 --> 01:07:06,784
Those were the only two criteria that we considered at this point, but we would take suggestions if there are further criteria that we ought to include in our process.

504
01:07:07,784 --> 01:07:13,085
I would just think maybe at your next meeting you designate 10-15 minutes to discuss it.

505
01:07:13,245 --> 01:07:21,168
I think anything given to you by the mayor's office or anybody, any organization, their project is going to be high priority.

506
01:07:21,188 --> 01:07:29,390
High priority by the standards that are established in our plan, not by necessarily the urgency felt by the applicant.

507
01:07:32,188 --> 01:07:32,488
Thank you.

508
01:07:32,508 --> 01:07:34,149
Thank you.

509
01:07:34,709 --> 01:07:35,409
Thank you, Mr. President.

510
01:07:35,429 --> 01:07:39,170
And again, thank you, your team doing a great job with this.

511
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:42,931
And we all know how Harris Park, the work it needs.

512
01:07:42,991 --> 01:07:45,831
I know that I receive phone calls right away.

513
01:07:46,612 --> 01:07:48,532
People, you know, what about car park?

514
01:07:48,952 --> 01:07:50,092
What about the baseball fields?

515
01:07:50,152 --> 01:07:52,153
And this is this is great because that's a dialogue.

516
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:57,954
And we express to people that I believe the deadline is coming up soon for the new round.

517
01:07:59,855 --> 01:08:00,495
The 15th, correct?

518
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:00,955
January.

519
01:08:02,376 --> 01:08:10,119
for the sixth, fifth, this Friday for the eligibility determination forms for the first round.

520
01:08:10,139 --> 01:08:19,702
And for the second round of funding, which will also be recommended in 2018, but in the fall, the project eligibility deadline, I believe is in April.

521
01:08:20,123 --> 01:08:21,343
I think it's April 13th.

522
01:08:21,783 --> 01:08:23,244
Yes, April 13th.

523
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:27,646
One of the big pieces, I know, being part of the recreation committee that we put together,

524
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:41,614
I think we should really pay close attention to making sure that part of these projects in the parks have inclusionary equipment for our special needs students.

525
01:08:42,015 --> 01:08:43,856
Is that spelt out in this?

526
01:08:43,876 --> 01:08:46,037
I don't know if the city can address that.

527
01:08:46,057 --> 01:08:54,303
I know the water is nice, but one thing that we talked about at the recreation meetings, we're trying to make more inclusionary parks and accessibility for our children.

528
01:08:56,084 --> 01:09:01,286
This is a preliminary design, it's a concept plan, but any design we do is fully accessible.

529
01:09:01,646 --> 01:09:03,267
I mean that has been for many, many years.

530
01:09:03,287 --> 01:09:08,150
Right, but it would be what was expressed in those meetings more of adaptive equipment.

531
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:11,972
So a child with a wheelchair with special equipment.

532
01:09:12,012 --> 01:09:13,933
When we get the grant we will be coming to you.

533
01:09:14,133 --> 01:09:14,333
Great.

534
01:09:15,405 --> 01:09:20,508
You will have an opportunity to have that input, just like last year.

535
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:23,829
It was the same funding source last year for Riverside Plaza.

536
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:29,392
We came to you, made comments, we tried to see if we could do some adaptations to make things work.

537
01:09:29,873 --> 01:09:34,415
Similarly, when we get this, we'll come before you and we'll have the same interactive process.

538
01:09:34,595 --> 01:09:34,955
But thank you.

539
01:09:34,975 --> 01:09:48,748
And again, I think this is what people were looking for when we, Roberta, started the dialogue with community preservation and looking into such important projects like this.

540
01:09:48,808 --> 01:09:50,410
So thank you very much.

541
01:09:52,003 --> 01:09:52,323
Thank you.

542
01:09:53,244 --> 01:09:55,685
Thank you, Mr. President.

543
01:09:57,486 --> 01:10:01,808
Roberta, you mentioned about other projects that are in the pipeline.

544
01:10:02,849 --> 01:10:08,272
At what point will this council see other projects that are in the pipeline?

545
01:10:09,212 --> 01:10:27,651
and be able to see, in my opinion, to be helpful to see a comparison of what funding is available, what projects are in the pipeline, because it's great to get these projects piecemeal, and everyone supports, Harris Park is around the corner from my home, I know it needs work, everyone supports this.

546
01:10:28,372 --> 01:10:48,422
but I also think it's important that we know what's out there, and there may come a time when you appear before us that we'd say, you know what, we realize this is important, but I also think creating more affordable housing in the city is equally as important, and maybe I'd like to pay more attention to that at this particular point.

547
01:10:48,723 --> 01:10:52,444
So at what point will we see as a council the total picture?

548
01:10:53,525 --> 01:10:57,067
Do you have the full timeline?

549
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,023
We have in the

550
01:11:03,685 --> 01:11:17,314
We have a timeline laid out of when all of the applications are due and when we anticipate bringing our full slate of recommendations for the first round and the second round of funding to the city council.

551
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:30,102
So we can keep you updated as we've received the applications as to what's in the pipeline and there would be a public process and hearings that occur with our committee

552
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:36,608
prior to our sending the recommendations or committing the recommendations to you.

553
01:11:38,691 --> 01:11:45,518
Is this the only application that you received from the city so far for the first round?

554
01:11:46,118 --> 01:11:49,280
This is the only full application that we've received.

555
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:56,184
So far the eligibility determination forms are just more or less an intent to apply.

556
01:11:57,865 --> 01:12:08,551
We initially had the deadline for the eligibility forms due prior to when this application was discussed by our committee.

557
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:13,874
Now the eligibility determination forms are due in the end of this week.

558
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:19,401
So before we meet again, we'll know what applications are potentially in the pipeline.

559
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:29,273
My question, Roberta, is on behalf of the city, is this the only application you've received so far on behalf of the city as a city entity?

560
01:12:29,313 --> 01:12:33,157
This is the only application that we've received because the deadline is not until March.

561
01:12:33,678 --> 01:12:37,601
but for eligibility termination forms, we were free something.

562
01:12:37,621 --> 01:12:39,303
No one else asked for early acceptance?

563
01:12:39,323 --> 01:12:39,943
No one else said?

564
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:45,428
No, no, because I don't think anyone else is on a timeline where they have to get a match before their grant is awarded.

565
01:12:45,448 --> 01:12:57,598
I'm not sure what the other funds that are being leveraged for the other projects, but we have received forms from the Community Garden Commission for four different gardens.

566
01:12:57,798 --> 01:13:00,821
I don't believe that they're gonna apply for all four, but they wanted to,

567
01:13:02,322 --> 01:13:10,546
make sure that they want to get it out there first, make sure that it's eligible, and then decide later which ones to apply for.

568
01:13:11,486 --> 01:13:13,147
So they applied.

569
01:13:13,167 --> 01:13:18,249
We have the Historical Commission has submitted, I think,

570
01:13:19,089 --> 01:13:22,772
was seven or nine eligibility termination forms.

571
01:13:22,852 --> 01:13:38,824
They also don't intend to submit full applications for all of those, but they, for planning purposes, to get all their ducks in a row, to have several month lead time to know which ones are worth filling out a complete application form to know what's eligible.

572
01:13:39,684 --> 01:13:44,248
And we also are expecting one from the mayor's office for the condon shell.

573
01:13:45,567 --> 01:13:52,697
But those are the ones that I know offhands that are City of Medford projects.

574
01:13:54,720 --> 01:14:01,110
As Council Longo Kern mentioned, knowing that there's a set amount of money.

575
01:14:02,387 --> 01:14:12,575
Do you think that we're opening the floodgate to other recipients or potential recipients saying, you know what, we don't want to sit back and wait.

576
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:20,422
We want to make ours as urgent as everyone else, get in there early, do what we have to do to be ahead of the curve.

577
01:14:20,762 --> 01:14:25,546
Do you think we open ourselves up for that by accepting something before?

578
01:14:27,737 --> 01:14:40,140
My sense from talking with other committee members is that they feel very conservative about considering an off-cycle application, that they want to see a very

579
01:14:45,722 --> 01:15:00,786
defined legitimate purpose for the off-cycle application, that the reason why the funding would need to be committed prior to when everybody else's funding is committed, there's a hard outside

580
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:08,968
deadline, externally imposed deadline that drives that early application.

581
01:15:09,108 --> 01:15:18,970
It's not just that they thought of it before everyone else, but it's because something else from outside is causing them to have to make that commitment now as opposed to later.

582
01:15:20,691 --> 01:15:30,613
And as I said, it's only something that we would consider for something that meets the high priority as defined in the planning process that we undertook.

583
01:15:32,294 --> 01:15:48,747
So the possibility is there, but I think that unless that external deadline applies to a project, they're going to be asked to get in the regular stream on cycle with the other applicants.

584
01:15:58,231 --> 01:15:58,932
Councilor Russo.

585
01:15:59,212 --> 01:16:14,282
Mr. President, I think we need to be certain of our intentions here because we're committing ourselves to a portion of this project needs and there still remains a balance of $176,000, $177,000 nearly.

586
01:16:22,298 --> 01:16:25,101
I'm correct in reading this 217 that we've been informed by someone

587
01:16:31,097 --> 01:16:37,701
who may or may not be authorized to inform us of that, that it's going to be asked for from free cash.

588
01:16:38,322 --> 01:16:44,226
So I hope when it comes time to make that expenditure that we'll go through with it.

589
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:58,235
Secondly, I wonder sometimes if, since there's been such a call in the past to not pass these proposals that are sent to us for the first time,

590
01:17:01,255 --> 01:17:06,222
why that concern isn't being raised, but I am in favor of this, Mr. President.

591
01:17:07,043 --> 01:17:07,344
Thank you.

592
01:17:10,872 --> 01:17:12,433
Thank you, President Carviello.

593
01:17:13,154 --> 01:17:15,135
One question about the applications.

594
01:17:15,576 --> 01:17:20,159
The applications or the forms that do come in, are those gonna be public, go public?

595
01:17:20,199 --> 01:17:24,002
Are we gonna be able to check them out online before you discuss them?

596
01:17:24,183 --> 01:17:35,572
Yes, it's all public information, so I was waiting until the deadline this Friday to aggregate everything and put it at least on the preservedbedford.org website.

597
01:17:35,632 --> 01:17:37,393
Oh, on your website, okay.

598
01:17:37,413 --> 01:17:39,395
Yes, we would host it and have them all there.

599
01:17:44,344 --> 01:17:45,490
And then just through the chair.

600
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,857
I'm not sure the city said we were definitely gonna be taking this out of free cash.

601
01:17:51,877 --> 01:17:55,039
It sounded like we, it's possible.

602
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:03,284
But will we be putting in, I guess, will we be putting in another application for CPA funding for the remaining?

603
01:18:03,765 --> 01:18:04,625
Not for this project.

604
01:18:04,645 --> 01:18:06,706
I mean, not for phase one.

605
01:18:06,826 --> 01:18:08,848
Not for phase one, but for phase two, potentially, for the 217,000.

606
01:18:08,908 --> 01:18:13,370
At that stage, we should be on time because

607
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:19,448
We should not be out of cycle, although we won't know if we're likely to get a grant.

608
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:25,380
For instance, if there's a funding cycle, we'll say from the park program in March.

609
01:18:33,486 --> 01:18:45,710
I wouldn't get the decision from the park program, you know that the CPA couldn't make their decision with all the other decisions and then when the park program came through we could put it all together.

610
01:18:48,219 --> 01:18:58,322
I think that this will be the only major off-cycle application because I think they will be anticipation rather than having a very good idea if you're getting matching funding.

611
01:18:58,342 --> 01:19:12,027
But for instance, I could, for instance, make an application for park funding in March, also make a CPA for the following October, and usually park funds, you're told about October and November if you're getting them.

612
01:19:12,427 --> 01:19:14,747
So it would line up in a different way than this.

613
01:19:14,767 --> 01:19:16,148
This is an exceptional circumstance.

614
01:19:16,848 --> 01:19:22,513
Because this is the first year of the CPA All that Okay, I think thank you.

615
01:19:22,593 --> 01:19:23,434
I think I read it wrong.

616
01:19:23,454 --> 01:19:33,102
I thought both phases were the 817 and you wouldn't need the 217 till phase two, but I guess it I Look at the sentence again.

617
01:19:33,122 --> 01:19:34,903
So phase two.

618
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:36,605
Do we know how much that is gonna cost?

619
01:19:36,625 --> 01:19:36,645
I

620
01:19:37,212 --> 01:19:45,536
There's a concept plan, and again that looks at the moment about $600,000, but that's phase two.

621
01:19:45,556 --> 01:19:47,197
We have to deal with phase one first.

622
01:19:47,237 --> 01:19:48,537
That's what we're pursuing at the moment.

623
01:19:55,220 --> 01:20:14,268
When we did the, last February when we did the concept for the whole park, then we realized we'd have to divide it into two pieces because the grants that are available generally are in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, and also they're reimbursable usually, and park grants,

624
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:24,014
Land and water, which we're hopefully getting for this, is a 50% reimbursement.

625
01:20:24,094 --> 01:20:31,859
So for instance, to get 300, you need to spend at least 600 of what they call eligible expenses.

626
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:38,664
At the moment, park is 60% reimbursement, so the figure is related.

627
01:20:43,308 --> 01:20:45,730
So to answer your question, I think this is phase one.

628
01:20:46,746 --> 01:20:47,186
817,000 is phase one.

629
01:20:47,306 --> 01:20:51,829
But that also includes design and construction oversight.

630
01:20:51,869 --> 01:21:10,198
Very often when we come to, we have already funded design or we've started the design, and very often when we get to a stage, and it's usually a major problem for us, when we go into construction, we have no money for construction oversight, and we have no contingency, and we are really in a bind.

631
01:21:11,118 --> 01:21:16,181
The proposal is to properly fund this so that we can actually do the project.

632
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:22,505
Councilor Mox.

633
01:21:23,767 --> 01:21:24,588
Clota.

634
01:21:26,251 --> 01:21:35,165
In previous grants that we've received, matching grants, we always had to show where we're gonna get the funding from, correct?

635
01:21:35,802 --> 01:21:42,446
That's what happens when we come to you, when we get the letter saying we're awarded.

636
01:21:42,746 --> 01:21:50,571
We come to you and when you do the vote, you will vote to accept the grant and to appropriate the funds.

637
01:21:51,192 --> 01:21:56,495
And that's one vote and that has to be sent to the state before they will actually sign the grant contract.

638
01:21:57,595 --> 01:22:00,097
But I just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing.

639
01:22:00,597 --> 01:22:05,400
When you say accept the funds, that is from the matching grant?

640
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,381
So we have to vote to accept the matching grant?

641
01:22:08,002 --> 01:22:11,584
But we also have to take a vote to approve this tonight, right?

642
01:22:12,564 --> 01:22:22,190
And when you go back to apply for the matching grant, all you're going to have at that particular time is what we're voting on tonight, and that doesn't cover the full project.

643
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:29,492
Yes, so when we come to you, we'll say in a month or six weeks, we will be asking you for another $217,000.

644
01:22:29,532 --> 01:22:30,172
Correct.

645
01:22:30,192 --> 01:22:38,854
I understand that, but are you going to be, between now and then, are you going to be applying for the... No, I've applied for it.

646
01:22:39,674 --> 01:22:52,137
You put in the application, and then you wait till they say, here we are, we're going to award it to you, and then we come to you, because there's no point in asking you for money if we don't know we're getting a match, because you've got to say no.

647
01:22:53,597 --> 01:23:01,941
So that's the way when we know we're getting the money then we come to you to say please accept the grant and front the total amount.

648
01:23:03,082 --> 01:23:06,704
So what's the urgency of voting on this tonight then?

649
01:23:08,965 --> 01:23:15,648
The CPA money has to be allocated in advance of us coming to you with the grant application because once

650
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:23,736
Once the city allocates money, then it cannot be replaced with CPA money.

651
01:23:24,457 --> 01:23:26,760
And that's why you have to get the CPA in place first.

652
01:23:29,062 --> 01:23:31,825
What happens if the other $200,000 doesn't come to fruition?

653
01:23:32,866 --> 01:23:33,366
We're in trouble.

654
01:23:36,273 --> 01:23:44,235
We need the project, the council is basically the body who controls whether this project will happen or not, because they approved funds.

655
01:23:44,355 --> 01:23:49,056
And you're saying phase two is another 600,000, so we're looking at about a million?

656
01:23:49,076 --> 01:23:51,437
At the moment, that's not designed or anything.

657
01:23:51,497 --> 01:23:55,338
We'll be looking to come maybe next year for phase two.

658
01:23:56,478 --> 01:24:03,820
This is hypothetical at the moment, but I'm trying to be as direct as I can, telling as much as I know.

659
01:24:05,919 --> 01:24:09,842
So why aren't we being asked to vote for the free cash tonight also?

660
01:24:09,862 --> 01:24:25,214
I mean, if you're going to get a commitment to use funds for CPA, so that means this body supports the concept, why wouldn't we be asked to... We could have done that, but you might be reluctant to do that when you haven't got the grant in your hand.

661
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:42,949
You know, when you appropriate the money then, you've appropriated on the off chance, I don't believe this for a second, we didn't get the park grant, sorry it's land and water, then you would have allocated money.

662
01:24:44,270 --> 01:24:53,018
It gives you a sense of security that the project is definitely going to happen before you allocate the additional funds.

663
01:24:54,745 --> 01:25:00,827
And if we don't get the grant, that money just goes back into the CPA?

664
01:25:00,867 --> 01:25:02,788
I don't believe for a second that we won't get the grant.

665
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:10,110
I've been told by the coordinator of the state that she's 99% sure, but she cannot absolutely say it until she gets the letter.

666
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:24,110
I just wanted to answer, if the funds, if CPA funds are appropriated for a project and not used for that project, they can be returned to the pool that's available for other projects.

667
01:25:26,693 --> 01:25:30,856
Shall be returned, yes.

668
01:25:30,896 --> 01:25:35,080
You can always vote to rescind back to the category in which you programmed the money.

669
01:25:41,299 --> 01:25:41,940
Thank you, Mr. President.

670
01:25:42,662 --> 01:25:43,263
Councilor Falco.

671
01:25:43,724 --> 01:25:44,585
Thank you, Mr. President.

672
01:25:44,726 --> 01:25:46,589
One quick question on what you just mentioned.

673
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,132
So does that money automatically go back in?

674
01:25:48,452 --> 01:25:51,799
Does it automatically go into that same bucket that it came out of?

675
01:25:52,139 --> 01:25:52,340
Yes.

676
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:53,141
OK, perfect.

677
01:25:53,301 --> 01:25:53,542
Thank you.

678
01:25:55,127 --> 01:26:04,557
That's actually why we specifically tell you which bucket it's coming out of, so that we know which bucket to put it back into should it ever occur on this or any future project.

679
01:26:04,597 --> 01:26:04,917
That's fine.

680
01:26:04,937 --> 01:26:08,861
I just wanted to get confirmation, just because it seemed, the way you said it, it just seemed funny.

681
01:26:08,881 --> 01:26:09,842
But I just wanted to make sure.

682
01:26:09,862 --> 01:26:13,506
So it goes back into the same bucket it came out of, and it can be used.

683
01:26:14,427 --> 01:26:15,428
the future for that purpose.

684
01:26:15,488 --> 01:26:15,688
Yes.

685
01:26:16,929 --> 01:26:17,449
Thank you very much.

686
01:26:17,509 --> 01:26:25,976
I mean, this is I mean, I've been down to Harris Park a number of times, and I think it's definitely a park that needs some work.

687
01:26:25,996 --> 01:26:29,498
We have a lot of parks that need some work, but I know that that park does need a lot of work.

688
01:26:29,778 --> 01:26:31,820
And I think it's definitely a worthy project.

689
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:32,520
So thank you.

690
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:35,202
Councilor McGrath.

691
01:26:35,403 --> 01:26:36,784
Thank you, President Carviello.

692
01:26:36,804 --> 01:26:39,586
I just want to check in on this $817,000 figures.

693
01:26:39,626 --> 01:26:40,767
Is that what you're submitting to the state?

694
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:46,173
Can that change at all?

695
01:26:46,193 --> 01:26:49,979
I mean, could it go down or could we reduce the project at all?

696
01:26:51,281 --> 01:26:54,767
What we applied to the state for, let me see, something like,

697
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:57,248
I think it was $667,000.

698
01:26:58,388 --> 01:26:59,009
You can only get $300,000.

699
01:26:59,049 --> 01:27:04,852
The maximum grant available in this cycle is $300,000.

700
01:27:05,392 --> 01:27:08,934
So you have to apply for at least $600,000.

701
01:27:10,615 --> 01:27:11,876
And it has to be eligible.

702
01:27:11,936 --> 01:27:15,258
And there are things that are not eligible that you need in a project.

703
01:27:15,738 --> 01:27:17,359
For instance, construction oversight.

704
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,841
The Clerk of the Works is not an eligible expense.

705
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:23,803
Police details are not an eligible expense.

706
01:27:24,123 --> 01:27:29,026
So if you spend that, you have to have money for that because the state will not reimburse that.

707
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,409
And that's why the money is more.

708
01:27:41,392 --> 01:27:42,012
Councilor Nye.

709
01:27:42,753 --> 01:27:46,855
Mr. President, I as one member of this body, very excited to see that the CPA is moving forward.

710
01:27:47,395 --> 01:27:54,879
I think that when the CPA ballot question was put on, put to the test for the voters, that this is what they envisioned happening.

711
01:27:54,939 --> 01:28:00,662
It's what I envisioned happening as well, where the community comes together and they put together a plan and work together to come up with a goal.

712
01:28:00,722 --> 01:28:02,302
And I really think this is a great plan.

713
01:28:02,362 --> 01:28:03,223
I think it's a bold plan.

714
01:28:03,863 --> 01:28:10,466
It's an expensive plant, but I think it's worthwhile, and I think it's a project that deserves to be funded.

715
01:28:10,526 --> 01:28:11,627
It has great merit.

716
01:28:11,907 --> 01:28:14,428
So for those reasons, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.

717
01:28:16,689 --> 01:28:19,811
On the motion by Councilor Nice, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

718
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:21,792
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

719
01:28:23,555 --> 01:28:23,655
Yes.

720
01:28:23,675 --> 01:28:23,735
Yes.

721
01:28:23,755 --> 01:28:23,915
Yes.

722
01:28:23,935 --> 01:28:23,995
Yes.

723
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:47,025
18-012, dear President Caraballo, members of the Memphis City Council.

724
01:28:47,606 --> 01:28:57,755
Recently, the city was informed that Medford will be the site of the filming of certain segments of a television production called City on a Hill.

725
01:28:59,596 --> 01:28:59,977
Yes, we are.

726
01:29:05,014 --> 01:29:10,778
Location Manager Ryan Cook and his staff have been in contact with various city officials regarding these filming activities.

727
01:29:11,299 --> 01:29:15,522
At this time, it is anticipated that one of the filming days will be January 16th.

728
01:29:16,383 --> 01:29:25,450
The production staff has advised Director of Public Health Department that it anticipates having a food truck preparing food for its crew in the parking lot of the VFW.

729
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:33,296
I respectfully request that the council endorse an approval of food trucks for this production as it has done in the past year.

730
01:29:33,796 --> 01:29:34,116
Thank you.

731
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:39,298
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, Councilor Nyeth.

732
01:29:39,338 --> 01:29:45,940
Yes, Mr. President, just my understanding that this is a food truck that's going to be not open to the public, but just open to the staff of the crew that's working on the film.

733
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:46,840
That is correct.

734
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:49,041
With that being said, I second Councilor DelaRusso's motion.

735
01:29:49,761 --> 01:29:53,382
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Nyeth.

736
01:29:53,962 --> 01:29:54,682
All those in favor?

737
01:29:54,702 --> 01:29:55,743
Aye.

738
01:29:55,803 --> 01:29:56,863
Motion passes.

739
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:06,435
Motion by Councilor Knight to revert back to regular business.

740
01:30:07,196 --> 01:30:08,979
Second by Councilor Falco.

741
01:30:10,201 --> 01:30:10,842
All in favor?

742
01:30:11,623 --> 01:30:12,444
Motion passes.

743
01:30:14,289 --> 01:30:25,698
18-0-0-7, offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that the sidewalk on the corner of Bradshaw and Honeywell be replaced in the interest of public safety.

744
01:30:26,038 --> 01:30:26,839
Councilor Mox.

745
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:28,580
Thank you, Mr. President.

746
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:32,983
This particular sidewalk panel has been an ongoing problem for a number of years.

747
01:30:33,624 --> 01:30:37,327
There's a small shade tree that is pushing up

748
01:30:38,047 --> 01:30:43,930
The panel, one of the residents actually tripped and got seriously hurt on this particular sidewalk.

749
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:49,672
So I would ask that DPW immediately go out there and review the issue in the interest of public safety.

750
01:30:50,912 --> 01:30:53,653
The motion by Councilor Mogg, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

751
01:30:53,733 --> 01:30:54,394
All those in favor?

752
01:30:54,954 --> 01:30:55,934
Motion passes.

753
01:30:55,954 --> 01:30:59,956
18-0-0-8, offered by Councilor Falco.

754
01:31:00,756 --> 01:31:07,181
Whereas resident students are forced to walk in the street when traversing city-owned sidewalks during and after snow storms.

755
01:31:07,221 --> 01:31:17,728
Be it resolved that the City of Medford purchase a trackless plow or snow removal apparatus to remove snow from city-owned sidewalks and property during inclement weather

756
01:31:18,408 --> 01:31:23,852
You give our DPW department the tools that they need to succeed.

757
01:31:24,453 --> 01:31:25,513
Councilor Falco.

758
01:31:25,894 --> 01:31:26,714
Thank you, Mr. President.

759
01:31:27,015 --> 01:31:41,085
This is an item that I have brought before the council before in the past, and the council supported it unanimously in the past and has not been included in past budgets, and it's something that

760
01:31:42,045 --> 01:31:45,448
I've strongly advocated for before, and I continue to do so.

761
01:31:45,788 --> 01:31:57,076
We expect our residents to clear their sidewalks after it snows, and the city should be doing the same thing with regard to city properties and sidewalks as well.

762
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:08,917
You know, we see our students, you know, they walk to and from school, residents walk when it snows out, and it's important to keep our sidewalks clean of snow.

763
01:32:09,437 --> 01:32:12,558
And it's basically a public safety issue.

764
01:32:13,218 --> 01:32:23,380
And now when you bring the Chevalier Theater on board now with running shows during the winter and whatnot, you know, we're asking people to walk from the parking lots here at City Hall

765
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:33,947
to Chevalier Theatre, and that's another reason why we should have a piece of machinery like this that can clear the snow.

766
01:32:33,987 --> 01:32:41,792
And it's important that we give our city workers, the DBW workers, the tools that they need, and I'm happy to say that we received a paper tonight

767
01:32:42,612 --> 01:32:44,214
from the mayor's office, and I'll read it.

768
01:32:44,394 --> 01:32:50,400
It's in response to the resolution that I offered, and it's from, let's see, it's from Brian Kerentz.

769
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:58,107
It's a commissioner of public works, and it's in response to Councilor Falco's resolution.

770
01:32:59,348 --> 01:32:59,448
18-008.

771
01:32:59,468 --> 01:33:16,860
After meeting with Mayor Stephanie M. Burke on Thursday, December 28th, regarding the purchase of a trackless plow for the Department of Public Works to better clear sidewalks during the winter months, we will be purchasing one for $130,545.

772
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:20,222
The machine is called the Holder, and it is made in Canada.

773
01:33:20,743 --> 01:33:23,565
The local dealer for this machine is in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.

774
01:33:24,125 --> 01:33:30,929
The machine will have a snowblower attachment, a power reversible plow blade, and a dump body and a sander unit.

775
01:33:30,969 --> 01:33:34,871
So happy to say that this issue sounds like it's being addressed.

776
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:52,762
Mr. President, if you wouldn't mind, if we could get just a further answer with regard to the timing on this, when we should actually see this piece of machinery here in our city and when we could actually see, may possibly see it in service.

777
01:33:53,733 --> 01:33:54,134
Thank you.

778
01:33:55,115 --> 01:33:55,836
Council Member Kern.

779
01:33:56,196 --> 01:33:57,999
Thank you, President Carviello.

780
01:33:58,259 --> 01:34:00,943
I want to thank Councilor Falco and second the resolve.

781
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:04,147
Definitely need this piece of equipment sooner than later.

782
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:10,676
He brought up a good point and we all discussed it at our meeting regarding the Chevalier Theatre.

783
01:34:12,274 --> 01:34:35,730
And the last several weeks, our sidewalks haven't really, they're doing the best they can, but I think it's really, they're definitely shoveled out, and I see our DPW out there working hard, but with regards to this apparatus and having a sander on it, it's something that we so desperately need, and it will definitely help everybody traverse our sidewalks.

784
01:34:36,310 --> 01:35:01,964
having the shows coming in, that's important, but we also have everyday customers and business owners traversing our sidewalks in the squares, and they need to be shoveled and sanded, and hopefully this will go a very long way and help out the department of the DPW to make sure we clear every square and sidewalk that we can, especially those two that are, the children that are going to school,

785
01:35:03,445 --> 01:35:12,233
I've got complaints already with regards to children heading to school, having to go onto the street, putting, obviously, their safety in jeopardy.

786
01:35:12,974 --> 01:35:18,418
So this is extremely important and hopefully it will go a very long way in every snowstorm.

787
01:35:19,299 --> 01:35:19,719
Thank you.

788
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:21,181
Councilor Nye.

789
01:35:21,461 --> 01:35:22,462
Move approval, Mr. President.

790
01:35:24,904 --> 01:35:25,565
Councilor Scott Pelly.

791
01:35:26,418 --> 01:35:28,400
Again, thank you, Mr. President.

792
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:29,941
Thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing that up.

793
01:35:30,002 --> 01:35:33,805
And I know that Kent Krause is in the crowd tonight.

794
01:35:33,825 --> 01:35:37,869
One thing we've all worked on is working with the school system, especially.

795
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:45,056
Kent traverses the Brooks area, and that's one of the hot spots that we always get phone calls from.

796
01:35:46,397 --> 01:35:51,041
And I think that what we really need to make sure that there's a collaboration and there's

797
01:35:51,922 --> 01:36:07,152
discussion, both the city and the school side, in making sure that these areas are done and there's a line of communication open between both departments.

798
01:36:07,172 --> 01:36:10,975
Not to say there isn't, but sometimes they do fall through the cracks.

799
01:36:11,095 --> 01:36:15,177
We're expecting, and I know that even this Thursday, they've increased it to 12 to 15 inches.

800
01:36:16,558 --> 01:36:20,902
for this Thursday and getting those areas taken care of as soon as possible.

801
01:36:32,984 --> 01:36:38,147
work on a plan for this upcoming storm to make sure these common areas are taken care of.

802
01:36:39,068 --> 01:36:44,871
I know that, unfortunately, probably won't be here by Thursday, so I just wanted to make sure that that was out there.

803
01:36:44,891 --> 01:36:45,411
So, thank you.

804
01:36:47,383 --> 01:36:48,524
Name and address of the record, please.

805
01:36:49,024 --> 01:36:52,126
Yes, thank you again, Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street.

806
01:36:52,286 --> 01:36:54,888
I wanted to speak in support of this resolution.

807
01:36:54,948 --> 01:36:59,311
I'm pleased to hear that the city has responded so quickly.

808
01:37:01,192 --> 01:37:09,258
I think the need has increased recently, and particularly, as you've heard, we're doing a lot of investing in our parks.

809
01:37:10,338 --> 01:37:16,223
Our squares, we have a very active Walk Medford community.

810
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:19,446
We have a very active bicycle commission.

811
01:37:20,206 --> 01:37:28,193
The Mr. Grover Watershed Association is putting a lot of emphasis behind completing the Mystic Greenways network.

812
01:37:29,174 --> 01:37:33,837
Some of those trails that we're seeing come online are

813
01:37:34,678 --> 01:37:36,499
responsibility of the city, some are not.

814
01:37:37,159 --> 01:37:45,461
So this will be helpful where we need to use the device at the parks and the trails that we're responsible for.

815
01:37:45,481 --> 01:37:53,103
But we're just going to be seeing a lot more people using the sidewalks and using the trails where this will be used.

816
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:56,805
I'm glad to see this is brought forward.

817
01:37:56,825 --> 01:38:09,972
And also, I know from my past experience with the transition team on the recreation subcommittee, we got a tour of all the parks from Mike Nestor, the park foreman.

818
01:38:10,272 --> 01:38:16,396
And he had said at that time that for a number of years, he has been strongly advocating for this type of a machine as well.

819
01:38:16,496 --> 01:38:18,177
So I know it'd be very welcome.

820
01:38:18,577 --> 01:38:31,867
One of the things he pointed out, in addition to its value and utility, currently the city has to, or at least when we spoke two years ago, use a bobcat primarily for removing the snow from sidewalks and places like this.

821
01:38:32,027 --> 01:38:38,552
And that requires another truck and a trailer to take it and deliver it to the site to be used.

822
01:38:38,932 --> 01:38:41,754
Whereas this type of machine is completely independent.

823
01:38:42,195 --> 01:38:46,758
It can run on its own and doesn't require the need for the truck and the trailer.

824
01:38:48,099 --> 01:38:53,963
The last question I had, and this kind of goes along the lines of urgency for this.

825
01:38:54,023 --> 01:38:57,665
I'm glad we're thinking about it for next year's budget, but perhaps it could come even sooner.

826
01:38:58,245 --> 01:39:05,630
And my question would be, is this something that could be possibly eligible for linkage fee money to be used on?

827
01:39:06,090 --> 01:39:22,098
We hear a lot about linkage fees when they're required for developments and a lot of developments are residential and they bring into the community a lot of people that use the sidewalks and use the paths, a lot of younger people, a lot of people that are bicycle users.

828
01:39:23,299 --> 01:39:24,139
All kinds of people.

829
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:30,844
And the linkage process is sort of mysterious to me.

830
01:39:30,864 --> 01:39:35,206
It's just a resident who, you know, tries to pay attention to what's going on.

831
01:39:35,627 --> 01:39:36,767
I rarely see, if ever,

832
01:39:38,028 --> 01:39:57,847
Any kind of meetings where they talk about the linkage money you'll see on the Zoning Board of Appeals meetings This is this project requires linkage money But we never really hear how much came in and where it goes and what it's what it's used for I think maybe correct me if I'm wrong that the council might even have a seat on the linkage committee that decides to

833
01:39:58,868 --> 01:39:59,548
point of information.

834
01:39:59,568 --> 01:40:01,549
Point of information Councilor Dela Russo.

835
01:40:01,869 --> 01:40:09,573
The president of the City Council is ex officio, a member of the linkage committee.

836
01:40:10,333 --> 01:40:17,276
And during my two year tenure as president, we met three times in properly noticed meetings

837
01:40:21,773 --> 01:40:22,834
do we call the minutes?

838
01:40:23,274 --> 01:40:23,495
Yes.

839
01:40:23,995 --> 01:40:24,616
I'll investigate.

840
01:40:24,676 --> 01:40:25,156
It's good to know.

841
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:31,642
And I think under Mayor Burke, we, no, I never met, maybe I met once under Mayor McLennan.

842
01:40:31,662 --> 01:40:32,563
I've had a couple.

843
01:40:32,603 --> 01:40:41,171
Under Mayor Burke, we've probably spent a good portion of it down on this type of stuff, the type of stuff of parks, public safety.

844
01:40:41,231 --> 01:40:44,013
It's parks, public safety, and one more.

845
01:40:45,094 --> 01:40:47,795
Infrastructure related to the development that comes in.

846
01:40:47,835 --> 01:40:48,575
So my point was that.

847
01:40:48,595 --> 01:40:49,856
I think I've had a couple Ken.

848
01:40:50,116 --> 01:40:51,056
It could be eligible.

849
01:40:51,136 --> 01:41:09,323
I would like to know as a citizen what kind of money is available and if this is eligible because if we don't need to put it in next year's budget, then perhaps that money could go toward additional personnel for the DPW because perhaps this will be utilized a lot and can't be used for people.

850
01:41:09,903 --> 01:41:15,966
Yeah, no, I'm saying that this, if we buy the machine with linkage money, we could use the budget money for personnel.

851
01:41:16,006 --> 01:41:24,311
I know we can't use linkage money for personnel, so just wanted to raise that as a possibility to expedite, hopefully getting this machine sooner than later.

852
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:26,572
So thank you, Councilor Falcone, for bringing that up.

853
01:41:29,053 --> 01:41:29,814
Councilor Locren.

854
01:41:30,054 --> 01:41:35,117
Maybe just as a side paper, we can get an update of how much money is in the linkage account currently.

855
01:41:37,657 --> 01:41:44,241
On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Lungo-Kern, seconded by Councilor Neistat.

856
01:41:45,162 --> 01:41:45,942
All those in favor?

857
01:41:46,202 --> 01:41:46,482
Aye.

858
01:41:47,783 --> 01:41:50,525
Mr. Clerk, roll call has been requested by Councilor Falco.

859
01:41:53,225 --> 01:41:54,266
Vice President Dela Russo.

860
01:41:54,426 --> 01:41:54,786
Yes.

861
01:41:55,366 --> 01:41:56,067
Councilor Falco.

862
01:41:56,147 --> 01:41:56,247
Yes.

863
01:41:56,947 --> 01:41:57,448
Councilor Knight.

864
01:41:57,488 --> 01:41:57,608
Yes.

865
01:41:57,648 --> 01:41:59,069
Councilor Allen-Curran.

866
01:41:59,229 --> 01:41:59,329
Yes.

867
01:41:59,789 --> 01:42:00,309
Councilor Mach.

868
01:42:00,510 --> 01:42:00,790
Yes.

869
01:42:01,410 --> 01:42:02,171
Councilor Scott Pelli.

870
01:42:02,431 --> 01:42:02,851
Yes.

871
01:42:02,951 --> 01:42:03,632
President Caprio.

872
01:42:03,692 --> 01:42:05,593
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

873
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,934
Motion passes.

874
01:42:07,954 --> 01:42:21,443
18-009, offered by Councilor Falco and Councilor Scott Pelli, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Joseph Pace on his recent passing.

875
01:42:23,367 --> 01:42:24,248
Councilor Falco.

876
01:42:24,748 --> 01:42:25,628
Thank you, Mr. President.

877
01:42:25,648 --> 01:42:30,810
Just this past Christmas Eve, we lost a good friend, Joe Pachi.

878
01:42:31,871 --> 01:42:42,175
He was a one-time Metro resident, lived up on Doonan Street for many years with his family, and owned Joe Pachi and Son grocery store.

879
01:42:42,575 --> 01:42:45,016
And just overall, just a great guy.

880
01:42:45,256 --> 01:42:50,698
I mean, good friend, great guy, and someone that was always there to help.

881
01:42:52,439 --> 01:43:02,451
For many years, I mean he you know when he had moved out of Medford, he always found time to donate time donate money Give to charitable organizations throughout our city.

882
01:43:03,131 --> 01:43:07,616
So he will be Missed greatly in thoughts and prayers to his family.

883
01:43:07,897 --> 01:43:10,179
Thank you council Scott belly Thank you.

884
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,962
I know council Falco not to repeat but I

885
01:43:14,263 --> 01:43:15,083
Joe deserves it.

886
01:43:16,124 --> 01:43:28,686
Joe Pace was a wonderful Italian-American, often the strongest voice in the North End while they were going through the big dig, and a person that loved his job and loved his family.

887
01:43:28,706 --> 01:43:33,728
I know Angela and Joe and Joey and

888
01:43:35,628 --> 01:43:40,329
You know, I spent a lot of time and donated a lot of time and effort in St.

889
01:43:40,369 --> 01:43:42,450
Francis Parish at the time.

890
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:50,512
And they were, Joe's passing, Wilhurt, he was one of those individuals that left a mark.

891
01:43:50,652 --> 01:43:57,053
And I think everybody that you talked to had a positive story about Joe Pace.

892
01:43:57,693 --> 01:44:03,795
And I can say a few from my personal, but I'll leave that with the family and myself.

893
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:08,789
We'll miss him and send our condolences to the family.

894
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:09,371
Thank you.

895
01:44:10,194 --> 01:44:10,756
All rise, please.

896
01:44:24,356 --> 01:44:38,507
18-013 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request the City Administration provide a cost estimate for the implementation of an annual diversity training program for all employees within the City of Memphis.

897
01:44:38,547 --> 01:44:39,227
Councilor Knight.

898
01:44:39,848 --> 01:44:41,129
Mr. President, thank you very much.

899
01:44:44,926 --> 01:45:07,577
number of new personnel that are coming on here in the community and this council's commitment to diversity and to inclusion in the city as well as that of the administration and the hiring of a new director of Diversity I think that it only makes sense for us mr. President to continue building upon the positive progress that we've made in the past When Diane McLeod was the director of the office of diversity she did have annual trainings for our city employees whether it was

900
01:45:09,913 --> 01:45:13,595
a training module on the computer or a presentation, Mr. President, but I think it was very beneficial.

901
01:45:13,615 --> 01:45:16,717
And I think it's something that doesn't, that should be pushed by the wayside.

902
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:25,222
So I'm asking the administration to take the appropriate steps to provide the council with a cost analysis as to what it costs to provide an annual diversity training for the city employees.

903
01:45:25,662 --> 01:45:29,464
And then we can take appropriate steps to determine whether or not we want to codify this as an ordinance.

904
01:45:29,504 --> 01:45:33,387
I request that it be done by executive order to ensure that it continues, Mr. President.

905
01:45:33,407 --> 01:45:35,468
So I'm asking my council colleagues to support this endeavor.

906
01:45:36,049 --> 01:45:41,950
so that we can get a little bit more information about what it costs for us to be able to implement an annual diversity training for our city employees.

907
01:45:43,924 --> 01:45:47,688
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor De La Russa, all those in favor?

908
01:45:48,468 --> 01:45:49,349
Motion passes.

909
01:45:49,369 --> 01:46:04,823
18-014 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request directed patrols to enforce resident access restrictions on Hastings Lane with particular focus on the morning and evening commuting hours.

910
01:46:04,943 --> 01:46:05,644
Councilor Knight.

911
01:46:06,405 --> 01:46:21,658
Yes, Mr. President, unfortunately the Waze app has found Hastings Lane and there are many vehicles that would come from Winchester and cut right down Woburn Street and follow Woburn Street all the way to the end and then cross over to High Street and go right down Hastings Lane even though it says resident access only between 7 to 9.

912
01:46:23,339 --> 01:46:24,620
It's becoming a problem in the neighborhood.

913
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,520
There are many young families that live in the neighborhood.

914
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:28,301
It's not an easy street to get up and down.

915
01:46:28,681 --> 01:46:29,761
Portions of it are unpaved.

916
01:46:29,821 --> 01:46:30,862
Portions of it are paved.

917
01:46:31,722 --> 01:46:35,263
Certain portions wouldn't allow two cars to traverse at the same time.

918
01:46:35,843 --> 01:46:42,525
And this lack of conscientiousness by certain commuters is causing an issue in the neighborhood, Mr. President.

919
01:46:42,585 --> 01:46:44,346
On Christmas Eve, I had the opportunity

920
01:46:44,806 --> 01:46:47,427
to visit a family friend over there, like I do every year.

921
01:46:47,987 --> 01:46:57,609
And the conversation that I had with every member of the family revolved around the number of cars that are going down the street during the hours that they're not supposed to be going down there, never mind the speed.

922
01:46:58,069 --> 01:47:12,372
So I'm asking, Mr. President, for the Traffic Division to do a directed patrol at Hastings Lane, either at the top at High Street or at the bottom down on Parkway, while the restrictions are in place, to see if we can catch some people going through the Do Not Enter sign.

923
01:47:12,872 --> 01:47:17,415
If a person goes down a restricted access street like that, when they go down that street, that is a moving violation.

924
01:47:17,455 --> 01:47:18,595
It's a surchargeable offense.

925
01:47:18,935 --> 01:47:19,976
It goes on your registration.

926
01:47:20,016 --> 01:47:21,517
It goes on your insurance, Mr. President.

927
01:47:21,537 --> 01:47:30,522
So for individuals that want to save five minutes cutting down a street, they have to realize that that five minutes that they're saving could cost them $700 a year for the next seven years.

928
01:47:31,142 --> 01:47:35,705
I think that, you know, there's a lack of conscientiousness and just ignorance, Mr. President, when it comes to some of these signs.

929
01:47:35,765 --> 01:47:36,826
And I think we're all guilty of it.

930
01:47:36,846 --> 01:47:40,928
We've all gone down a sign that might have said, you know, resident access only before.

931
01:47:40,968 --> 01:47:42,429
I know I've done it on rural ave before.

932
01:47:43,170 --> 01:47:43,750
We've all done it.

933
01:47:44,070 --> 01:47:46,071
But ultimately, it's causing an issue in the neighborhood.

934
01:47:46,091 --> 01:47:46,812
It needs to be addressed.

935
01:47:46,832 --> 01:47:48,633
And I'm asking for some help from our police department.

936
01:47:49,673 --> 01:48:03,781
If I can amend that to ask if the police department has a way of contacting Waze to have them come down and put them on notice of the signs on different streets.

937
01:48:03,941 --> 01:48:08,463
I don't know if Waze has a... I would certainly be open to amending the paper as a B paper.

938
01:48:08,503 --> 01:48:12,585
I just don't want them to say that we can't contact Waze so we're not going to do the directive patrol.

939
01:48:12,825 --> 01:48:17,488
So as long as it's a B paper and they have two separate tasks to move on, I'd be happy to do it, Mr. President.

940
01:48:18,087 --> 01:48:21,088
Thank you, Mr. President, I was just gonna mention that I know he has

941
01:48:31,468 --> 01:48:34,530
some sort of contact or some way to reach out to ways he's done it in the past.

942
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:40,473
And this is definitely something that I think we should definitely push in his direction, have him look into.

943
01:48:40,693 --> 01:48:42,274
It definitely needs to be addressed.

944
01:48:42,294 --> 01:48:47,176
It's amazing what that app has done to our city streets in our neighborhoods.

945
01:48:47,837 --> 01:48:55,401
And while we're on the topic, just to mention really quick, tomorrow night at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital School of Nursing is our next

946
01:48:56,281 --> 01:48:57,302
community police meetings.

947
01:48:57,322 --> 01:49:06,588
I just wanted to bring that up, but I thought it was appropriate to bring it up now, since we are talking about this issue here, and a lot of issues like this here are discussed during that type of meeting.

948
01:49:06,608 --> 01:49:13,032
The Lawrenceboro Hospital is right down the street from Hastings Lane, so if anybody in Hastings Lane wants to go down to the hospital, let the chief know.

949
01:49:13,312 --> 01:49:24,279
On the motion by Councilor Layton, on the B paper, that we contact Sergeant Hartman, contact Waze, and see if they can update their software.

950
01:49:26,649 --> 01:49:43,810
seconded by the councilor falco all those in favor right on the original paper offered by councilor night seconded by councilor falco all in favor all right motion passes president motion take papers in the hands of the clerk motion by councilor night to take papers in the hands of the clerk seconded by councilor scarpelli

951
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:49,832
18-015, offered by Councilor Scott Pelley.

952
01:49:50,792 --> 01:49:59,434
It's the resolve of Memphis City Council to send their deep and sincere condolences to the family of John Bob Conner on his recent passing.

953
01:49:59,494 --> 01:50:00,794
Councilor Scott Pelley.

954
01:50:00,834 --> 01:50:02,095
Thank you, Mr. President.

955
01:50:03,015 --> 01:50:06,776
The Conner family, well-known in the Spring Street area.

956
01:50:07,856 --> 01:50:13,817
Mr. Conner was a loving member of his community.

957
01:50:13,897 --> 01:50:14,638
He loved Medford.

958
01:50:16,538 --> 01:50:20,803
He was a member of the Mustang Association.

959
01:50:20,823 --> 01:50:24,667
He was also a past board member of the Wellington Club with Little League.

960
01:50:25,288 --> 01:50:26,489
I grew up with his son, Sean.

961
01:50:29,799 --> 01:50:55,362
Mr.. As of yesterday's wake had some great stories how mr.. Connor up until last week watched our program on Tuesday nights and made sure he always Sent message and what he thought This council should be doing so and I appreciated that he's a great person great family Great Mustang, so he'll be missed

962
01:50:56,142 --> 01:50:56,623
Thank you.

963
01:50:57,483 --> 01:50:58,704
And we have another one here.

964
01:50:59,945 --> 01:51:00,926
Offered by Councilor Knight.

965
01:51:01,006 --> 01:51:07,231
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Dante DeFranco Sr.

966
01:51:07,651 --> 01:51:08,712
on his recent passing.

967
01:51:08,752 --> 01:51:09,332
Councilor Knight.

968
01:51:09,893 --> 01:51:11,494
Mr. President, yes, thank you very much.

969
01:51:11,714 --> 01:51:14,796
For any of us from West Medford, we'd all know Dante DeFranco.

970
01:51:14,837 --> 01:51:17,819
He'd be the best dressed guy walking around West Medford Square, Mr. President.

971
01:51:18,879 --> 01:51:26,241
construction work that was always impeccably dressed and always someone that was willing to sit down and give you a hello and ask how you were doing down in West Memphis Square.

972
01:51:26,281 --> 01:51:39,164
So with that being said, Mr. President, he suddenly passed away just over the past week and I'd like to have my council colleagues join me in offering my condolences and our condolences to Mrs. DeFranco and Dante Jr.

973
01:51:39,184 --> 01:51:43,305
and Danielle and Dean as they go through this difficult time, especially during the holidays, Mr. President.

974
01:51:43,605 --> 01:51:44,025
Thank you.

975
01:51:44,185 --> 01:51:47,146
And we have one last one offered by Councilor Knight.

976
01:51:49,207 --> 01:52:01,215
January 6, 2018 marks the 7th anniversary of the passing of lifelong resident of Medford, Vietnam veteran, community activist, and Governor's Counselor, Michael J. Callahan.

977
01:52:01,656 --> 01:52:16,026
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council hold a moment of silence in his honor, and be it further resolved that the Memphis City Council dedicate the 1-2-18 Council Meeting in memory of Michael J. Callahan, former Governor's Counselor, Counselor Knight.

978
01:52:16,486 --> 01:52:17,767
Mr. President, thank you very much.

979
01:52:17,827 --> 01:52:19,167
Michael and I were very close friends.

980
01:52:19,227 --> 01:52:20,388
Michael was a mentor to me.

981
01:52:20,928 --> 01:52:23,109
He taught me a great deal about how government works.

982
01:52:23,609 --> 01:52:38,535
And I think when you look at Michael Callaghan and his career in government, especially as a resident here of Medford who's been credited with the legend of saving Wrights Pond from development, his slogan in the 2005 Senate campaign summed up Michael Callaghan.

983
01:52:38,575 --> 01:52:39,836
And Michael Callaghan helped people.

984
01:52:39,996 --> 01:52:40,556
He helped people.

985
01:52:40,976 --> 01:52:43,096
That's what Michael did, and I sadly miss Mr. President.

986
01:52:43,156 --> 01:52:46,477
I'd ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence and to dedicate tonight's meeting in his memory.

987
01:52:48,337 --> 01:52:48,817
Please rise.

988
01:53:01,079 --> 01:53:01,480
Records.

989
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:09,681
The meeting of records for the decisive meeting are passed to Councilor Mox.

990
01:53:10,793 --> 01:53:13,094
excuse me, December 19th, we will pass to Council of Mox.

991
01:53:13,154 --> 01:53:16,756
Council of Mox, how did you find those records?

992
01:53:18,457 --> 01:53:22,539
On the motion by Council of Mox to approve of the record, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

993
01:53:23,559 --> 01:53:24,160
All in favor?

994
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:25,941
Motion passes.

995
01:53:27,581 --> 01:53:31,263
On the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly for adjournment, seconded by Councilor Knight.

996
01:53:31,764 --> 01:53:32,384
All in favor?

997
01:53:33,164 --> 01:53:34,525
Motion passes, meeting adjourned.

998
01:55:41,798 --> 01:55:41,859
you

999
02:00:28,618 --> 02:00:37,422
the smog and the fog and the pollution has gripped the airport and not many people have been getting in and out of the city so not a great new year start I'm afraid to say.

1000
02:00:37,442 --> 02:00:46,386
No indeed I do worry for your health when you join us on Business Matters Rahul because I know you go out to the street because you get a better signal to be able to broadcast but you do have to breathe in all of the fumes of the traffic.

1001
02:00:47,970 --> 02:00:50,033
I know, but it's now the cold air here, I'm afraid.

1002
02:00:50,373 --> 02:00:54,739
It may be 20 degrees, but I have to say, quite a comical sight in Kolkata at the moment.

1003
02:00:54,779 --> 02:01:03,250
It looks like a convention of bank robbers, as everybody's wearing these monkey caps, balaclavas, shivering in 20 degrees, I'm afraid to say here.

1004
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:07,971
Sounds terrible, as we're about 15 degrees colder.

1005
02:01:08,931 --> 02:01:28,976
Talk to me about one of these stories that you've been looking at, which is to do with Indian doctors not very happy with the government because it is offering, or considering offering, a short kind of bridging course to homeopaths and others trained in alternative medicines that would allow them to become doctors.

1006
02:01:29,036 --> 02:01:30,857
It's being called sanctioned quackery.

1007
02:01:32,223 --> 02:01:33,084
Yes, indeed it is.

1008
02:01:33,164 --> 02:01:36,647
And you know, this is not the first time the idea has been considered.

1009
02:01:36,887 --> 02:01:53,401
And whilst a lot of doctors of yesterday went on a strike in private hospitals, others in public hospitals were wearing black armbands to say, look, what a ludicrous idea this is, what the government and actually some other people involved in the medical profession say is, India has a huge problem.

1010
02:01:53,521 --> 02:01:55,683
It does not produce enough doctors.

1011
02:01:55,983 --> 02:02:07,292
And not only does it not produce enough doctors, but if you go into the rural sector of the country, many doctors don't want to go and stay there because they say the facilities aren't good enough for their children in terms of education, etc.

1012
02:02:07,673 --> 02:02:10,475
So what's going to happen to the health needs of these people?

1013
02:02:10,735 --> 02:02:14,818
You can't suddenly create, you know, double the number of doctors overnight.

1014
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:18,061
So you have to find some sort of interim solution.

1015
02:02:18,381 --> 02:02:21,324
And that's what this idea has always been, that you take people

1016
02:02:21,704 --> 02:02:29,028
who practice medicine, these sort of quacks that exist up and down this country, and give them a little bit more professional training.

1017
02:02:29,268 --> 02:02:41,434
Look, they're operating anyway, a lot of people say, so, you know, give them some medical skills so that they're able to cope with basic emergencies, so that people in those areas can actually have some sort of medical

1018
02:02:42,814 --> 02:02:45,855
treatment when they need it in those situations.

1019
02:02:45,955 --> 02:02:55,157
I mean doctors on the other hand say look you know this is just not the right way to do it but I have to say you know when I go to rural India you see quacks performing there.

1020
02:02:55,577 --> 02:02:57,457
They are being used by a lot of people there.

1021
02:02:58,137 --> 02:03:12,140
I think there is a lot of critics and a lot of others who say you have to give some sort of medical facilities to people so let's try this method out because at the moment you have millions and millions of people in India who have no access to health care.

1022
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:13,021
Indeed.

1023
02:03:13,581 --> 02:03:16,443
Another story which is in the Times of India today.

1024
02:03:17,103 --> 02:03:21,607
The number of visitors to the Taj Mahal is to be capped at 40,000 a day.

1025
02:03:21,647 --> 02:03:22,227
Why is that?

1026
02:03:23,988 --> 02:03:30,533
I think it is just the damage that the sheer number of people who are visiting the Taj Mahal, you know, cause.

1027
02:03:30,653 --> 02:03:37,878
I mean, I've been there on public holidays to India's most famous monument, one of the greatest monuments in the world.

1028
02:03:38,999 --> 02:03:43,461
You know, and you can have 60, 80,000 people who are turning up.

1029
02:03:43,501 --> 02:03:48,763
And there's been a long debate about how do you protect, you know, India's iconic building.

1030
02:03:49,183 --> 02:03:55,386
And I think now this is why they've decided that at least for Indians, there's going to be 20,000 in the morning, 20,000 in the afternoon.

1031
02:03:55,746 --> 02:03:58,767
Once they cross that figure, you just won't be able to go in.

1032
02:03:58,807 --> 02:04:04,490
The good news for all the foreign tourists is no restrictions on them, but obviously they pay far more than Indians.

1033
02:04:05,270 --> 02:04:13,215
Anyway, and I think it's part of a much wider debate whether you're talking about India's, when India's looking at tourism, about how to protect it.

1034
02:04:13,315 --> 02:04:15,756
I mean, the tigers are another thing here.

1035
02:04:15,776 --> 02:04:19,598
I mean, how do you protect the national parks from the huge number of people who are coming in?

1036
02:04:19,899 --> 02:04:26,963
And I think India's looking at a much more long-term vision when it comes to tourism now, because it's not about getting people in over the next 10 years.

1037
02:04:27,023 --> 02:04:30,064
It's about the next 50, 100 years about how you develop it.

1038
02:04:30,084 --> 02:04:34,247
So I think we could see more things like this at other sites in India as well.

1039
02:04:34,567 --> 02:04:42,644
Is this controversial with many people that Indians are going to be restricted in numbers visiting an Indian monument, yet foreigners won't?

1040
02:04:44,193 --> 02:04:46,274
I think that once it comes in, it probably will be.

1041
02:04:46,954 --> 02:04:58,721
And I think it's about communicating that information accurately to people, because often when you go to the Taj, you know, you'll see people who come from miles and villages, a lifetime's moment to go and see it.

1042
02:04:58,781 --> 02:05:05,024
And if they turn up and find out that it's shut or it's going to be shut to them, I'm sure they are going to get pretty angry.

1043
02:05:05,544 --> 02:05:07,685
I think it's about getting that information out.

1044
02:05:07,745 --> 02:05:13,186
A lot of people still turn up at the Taj Mahal, foreigners and Indians, on a Friday, even though it's closed.

1045
02:05:13,206 --> 02:05:15,167
So I think it's getting that information out.

1046
02:05:15,207 --> 02:05:23,289
But certainly, if you've spent a lot of money getting there as an Indian, and you're restricted to get in, and you see foreigners going in, well, you may get annoyed.

1047
02:05:23,309 --> 02:05:24,910
But there is a little loophole there.

1048
02:05:25,290 --> 02:05:30,431
If you do want to go in, if you pay the foreigners' rate, whether you're a foreigner or not, you will be allowed in.

1049
02:05:30,451 --> 02:05:32,992
The problem is, for many Indians, that's just going to be way too expensive.

1050
02:05:33,272 --> 02:05:33,592
Indeed.

1051
02:05:33,793 --> 02:05:34,153
Interesting.

1052
02:05:34,193 --> 02:05:34,894
Thank you, Rahul.

1053
02:05:34,954 --> 02:05:35,895
Get back indoors.

1054
02:05:35,935 --> 02:05:37,156
Get out of all that fumes.

1055
02:05:37,316 --> 02:05:38,817
Clearly got the back of your throat a bit earlier.

1056
02:05:39,418 --> 02:05:40,339
Good to talk to you as always.

1057
02:05:40,439 --> 02:05:43,942
That's the BBC's Rahul Tandon there in Calcutta in India.

1058
02:05:46,885 --> 02:05:53,191
And they called it puppy love.

1059
02:05:53,311 --> 02:05:57,115
How much is that hound dog in the window?

1060
02:05:58,384 --> 02:06:00,787
I do hope that fleabag's first.

1061
02:06:10,449 --> 02:06:13,231
We are going doggy crazy on Business Matters.

1062
02:06:14,251 --> 02:06:15,892
Various songs, I'm sure you'll recognise that.

1063
02:06:15,912 --> 02:06:19,434
I won't ask Andrew People and Bridget Bodnar to name every single song, that would be unfair.

1064
02:06:20,055 --> 02:06:24,177
But we are going to discuss something called Paternity Leave.

1065
02:06:25,238 --> 02:06:30,201
We've discussed over the years on Business Matters the various pet-friendly policies that companies

1066
02:06:30,961 --> 02:06:34,163
have brought in, but this is a new related trend.

1067
02:06:34,563 --> 02:06:44,049
Lots of employees of course take maternity, paternity leave when they have a baby or adopt a child, but now many companies are offering paternity leave for pet owners.

1068
02:06:44,609 --> 02:06:48,592
It is where employees are allowed to take time off when they get a new dog.

1069
02:06:49,252 --> 02:06:53,815
It started among US technology startup businesses, but it seems to be spreading.

1070
02:06:54,315 --> 02:06:56,757
A brewery in Ohio has introduced the policy.

1071
02:06:57,177 --> 02:07:00,079
It's the appropriately named Brew Dog USA.

1072
02:07:00,299 --> 02:07:05,343
I've been talking to the boss, Tanisha Robinson, and I asked her about her own four-legged friends.

1073
02:07:06,263 --> 02:07:08,665
I actually have three dogs.

1074
02:07:09,145 --> 02:07:13,729
We have a pit bull hound mix, a chihuahua, and a pomeranian.

1075
02:07:13,809 --> 02:07:18,192
So about 90 pounds of dogs, but in the form of three creatures.

1076
02:07:19,083 --> 02:07:21,965
And so why did you decide then to introduce Pawternity?

1077
02:07:21,985 --> 02:07:24,748
Was this because you yourself wanted some time off?

1078
02:07:25,068 --> 02:07:43,683
No, I don't have any new dogs on my horizon, which is now post the introduction of Pawternity Leave, but we feel that it's a great benefit to offer our team when they introduce a new family member, whether it's a human or canine member of the family, so that people can take time to bond.

1079
02:07:44,003 --> 02:07:47,446
It's not just because you've got the word dog in the name of the company.

1080
02:07:48,871 --> 02:07:56,839
Well, I mean, our company was founded by two humans and one dog ten years ago, so that is certainly an important component of our business.

1081
02:07:57,240 --> 02:07:59,182
What is the benefit of doing this?

1082
02:07:59,222 --> 02:08:03,766
Because you don't offer it for people who get a new cat or a new rabbit or something, do you?

1083
02:08:03,947 --> 02:08:06,810
So why have you decided to introduce it?

1084
02:08:07,709 --> 02:08:11,271
We want to be the best place to work on the earth ever.

1085
02:08:11,852 --> 02:08:15,294
And, you know, dogs have a special place in the history of our business.

1086
02:08:15,374 --> 02:08:22,738
And certainly, you know, someone who's horribly allergic to cats, you know, I think dogs are truly a man's best friend.

1087
02:08:23,158 --> 02:08:24,859
How much time then can people take off?

1088
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:26,380
People get a week off.

1089
02:08:26,681 --> 02:08:28,542
They bring a new dog into their family.

1090
02:08:28,942 --> 02:08:29,602
And it's paid?

1091
02:08:30,143 --> 02:08:30,363
Yes.

1092
02:08:31,063 --> 02:08:33,305
How many people have made use of this then so far?

1093
02:08:33,465 --> 02:08:37,107
So on our US team, we've had four people take paternity leave so far.

1094
02:08:38,129 --> 02:08:41,010
What do the colleagues of people with dogs make of this?

1095
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:43,891
Because if you don't have a dog, of course, you're not entitled to it.

1096
02:08:44,571 --> 02:08:50,253
Well, they certainly have the opportunity to be entitled to it if they adopt a dog or bring a new dog into their family.

1097
02:08:50,533 --> 02:08:56,035
But we also are a dog-friendly office space, so there's a lot of love for dogs in our business.

1098
02:08:56,833 --> 02:09:03,874
Do you think it's only a certain type of company that does and will offer this kind of leave for employees?

1099
02:09:03,914 --> 02:09:10,576
Because some people still grumble they get too few holidays, never mind being able to take time off to look after a pet.

1100
02:09:11,296 --> 02:09:15,637
At BrewDog, it's really important for us to take great care of our people.

1101
02:09:16,057 --> 02:09:19,838
Our two most important things in our whole business are our people and our beer.

1102
02:09:20,278 --> 02:09:25,219
And for us, that means letting people spend some time bonding with a new puppy if they get one.

1103
02:09:25,966 --> 02:09:28,473
You said you also let people bring dogs to work.

1104
02:09:29,235 --> 02:09:37,519
Do they not cause a nuisance in the office, wandering in during meetings or demanding they go for walkies when you're on a deadline or something?
