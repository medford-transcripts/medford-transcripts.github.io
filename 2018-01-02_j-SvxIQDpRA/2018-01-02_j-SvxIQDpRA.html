    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=0.431s">It's</a>  a shell that, when it bursts in the sky, it has 35 of these gold-glittering comets in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=8.401s">And</a>  the glitter kind of looks like if you ground up 18-karat gold and pixie-dusted it into the sky, and it twinkles when it descends. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=17.572s">It</a>  ignites the burst charge at its full apex up in the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=21.615s">That</a>  burst charge also ignites the stars. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=25.077s">And</a>  just as you think that the comet is going to extinguish and go out, it then splits again and it creates this dust effect at the tail end of the burn. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=36.664s">It's</a>  something that's special to me and also the rest of the family when you see that shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=41.167s">It's</a>  also a tribute and a remembrance of my dad.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=49.942s">Jimmy</a>  Guzzi once told me about making fireworks, that an accident was always vaguely in the back of the mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=56.57s">You</a>  live with it every day, he told me, sort of like knowing that nuclear weapons are pointed at you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=68.113s">My</a>  second great-grandfather started our business in Bari, Italy in 1850. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=75.276s">They</a>  immigrated to Ellis Island in the early 1900s and they set up a factory literally six, seven miles from where we're sitting here today on Long Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=85.139s">And</a>  they operated their factory until about the late 1920s, 1929. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=90.463s">My</a>  grandfather, he opened his own factory in 1929 right in this very village, Bellport Village. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=97.148s">So</a>  he had three children. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=98.509s">He</a>  and my grandmother had three children, which was the fourth generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=102.492s">And</a>  my father was the oldest. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=105.434s">And</a>  he was somewhat the innovator at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=109.677s">I</a>  remember the days of being at Coney Island at five, six years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=113.84s">And</a>  it got into my blood. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=116.222s">I</a>  mean, I was with my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=118.163s">The</a>  show would go off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=119.064s">All</a>  the people would come up, clap, you know, tell him, have a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=121.846s">And</a>  it's addictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=123.287s">And</a>  that, to me, at five years old, the energy, the camaraderie of being with a group of people, the ability to create something and see so many people enjoy it, it's addictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=134.214s">And</a>  at that time, I knew from as long as I can remember that this is what I wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=142.367s">And</a>  then in 1983, unfortunately, we had the explosion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=145.51s">On</a>  a Saturday of a Thanksgiving weekend, the Gucci's plant exploded. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=149.913s">Debris</a>  from this blast drifted down on townships 10 miles away. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=155.558s">Jimmy</a>  Gucci had been working on the big shells he loved to make, big eight-inch color shells, though he was always a bit anxious about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=164.216s">He</a>  and his cousin, a pretty dark-haired girl who was Jimmy's assistant, were instantly killed only a few feet from the shop where they were working on the big shelves. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=174.376s">Something</a>  must have happened in there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=185.871s">We</a>  lost everything, you know, we lost two loved ones and lost our entire facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=190.654s">There</a>  was a lot of activity, there was a lot of shoes to fill, there was a lot of space to fill because there was a big gap that was caused by losing him. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=199.198s">So</a>  I kind of took the role of trying to fill his shoes and still am trying to fill his shoes.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=209.824s">Good</a>  morning, fireworks by Gritchy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=213.325s">Favorite</a>  firework would be a brocade Camaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=216.986s">It's</a>  a large, breaking, big willow type Camaro that would descend all the way down to the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=224.108s">And</a>  with the music and a large volley of them, it just fills the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=227.85s">It's</a>  a beautiful show.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=229.15s">I</a>  like the spectacle of the Niagara Falls. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=232.191s">You</a>  know, you have some pictures around here that you'll see the Niagara Falls coming off the entire bottom part of the Brooklyn Bridge, from the bottom of the actual bridge itself, hitting the East River down below. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=245.837s">So</a>  I'll never forget firing that shell, that exact effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=251.579s">And</a>  it still brings shivers up my spine now, thinking about it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=258.213s">I</a>  love the giant willow ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=259.996s">They're</a>  just so pretty when they come down like a waterfall. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=262.54s">It</a>  twinkles as it's coming down, and then it slowly dissipates, so it makes it really pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=267.827s">Kind</a>  of magical, I guess.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=276.602s">When</a>  somebody asks me what's my occupation, I generally would say we're in the firework entertainment business, as well as manufacturing of explosives business, because the other half of our business, about 50% of our revenue, is in manufacturing of explosives for the Department of Defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=293.408s">We</a>  make a tremendous amount of training devices, hand grenade simulators, ground bomb simulators, trip flare simulators, and things like that, as well as some components that go into live munitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=305.893s">So,</a>  I say we're a fireworks performance company as well as a manufacturer for the Department of Defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=327.398s">This</a>  New Year's Eve, we're in the heart of the design process right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=331.341s">A</a>  project of this size has about 40,000 different cues and circuits that have to be initiated over an eight-and-a-half-minute period. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=343.288s">Do</a>  you get a sense of the aerial drone, but it's still unknown? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=349.452s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=349.632s">You</a>  absolutely have a sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=352.614s">If</a>  everything goes perfectly, what this is going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=356.707s">But</a>  there's always so many variables in a live performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=360.409s">One,</a>  rehearsal, you can't fire this whole show and then look at it and make changes in real time out in the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=368.59s">So</a>  this is the countdown towards the launching of the world record show. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=376.715s">So</a>  these are digits, sky-etching digits that are fired with a series of comets that are fired in a very tight pattern to create the digits. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=385.98s">Now</a>  you notice it's not one digit every second. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=389.742s">It's</a>  slow in the beginning, but now you'll see it picks up. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=394.765s">And</a>  it's intended to be very quiet as far as nothing in the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=400.174s">And</a>  then you'll see this long tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=401.976s">This</a>  is the launching of the shell now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=403.918s">You</a>  see this long tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=405.079s">The</a>  music will be playing also with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=409.803s">And</a>  then when it reaches its apex... Now each one of these... <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=420.387s">These</a>  small trails will be one 5-inch in diameter, 5-pound comet that's loaded inside of the shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=428.091s">And</a>  it's designed to burn long enough for it to come all the way down to the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=432.453s">So</a>  when you see that...</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1513.11s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and it's with great honor and great pride that I rise tonight to honor, in my opinion, someone that has done so much for this community, not only in the capacity as a member of the school committee for three decades, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1530.212s">but</a>  also as someone very involved in many, many organizations throughout the community, and someone very instrumental in leading the path on many, many initiatives in this community, of which I will mention some here tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1548.655s">I</a>  personally had the opportunity to serve with Lena DiGentimaso for six years as a member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1556.186s">It</a>  was my first time elected in this community back some years ago and when I first got on the school board it was <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1563.557s">kind</a>  of intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1565.92s">I</a>  was new to the process, new to the system, and Lena was one of the first people to put her hand out and welcome me to the school committee and really took me under her wing for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1583.141s">to</a>  show me the ins and outs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1585.182s">And</a>  I can remember my first few times being part of the negotiations when we used to have to negotiate with the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1596.671s">And</a>  this would be a lengthy six, seven hour night. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1601.875s">We</a>  used to get in there at five o'clock, no breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1606.118s">And</a>  you can always count on one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1609.271s">and</a>  it wasn't to settle the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1611.332s">It</a>  was the fact that Lena would cook a homemade lasagna and make sure that everyone was fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1619.137s">That</a>  was the type of person she was. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1621.599s">She</a>  was very considerate and always thinking of others. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1627.563s">Her</a>  one goal that I found out early as a member of the school committee, she taught me, she said, Mike, no matter what happens, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1636.328s">We're</a>  here for the children of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1639.351s">We're</a>  here to make sure they get the best education possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1643.534s">And</a>  she said, my votes are always predicated on whatever is good for the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1648.298s">And</a>  I learned that early with Lena that she was very dedicated, she was very loyal, and she meant what she said. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1656.605s">She</a>  didn't go back on her word. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1658.126s">If</a>  Lena gave you her word, her word was as good as gold, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1665.755s">You</a>  know, another thing too, Lena attended every single meeting, not just with the school committee and other meetings we had, every single function that happened in this community, Lena Degentamaso was part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1682.243s">And</a>  I think that says a lot about a person's character and their commitment to doing the job that they're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1692.204s">Lena</a>  served, like I said, for three decades on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1696.707s">Never</a>  ran or never intended to run for any other public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1702.271s">Her</a>  commitment was to the kids of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1705.853s">Never</a>  had any political aspirations other than to helping the kids of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1711.017s">And</a>  that's what she did for three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1715.76s">Lena</a>  was also the longest serving member of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1720.223s">She</a>  was a strong advocate for the Medford Vocational Technical High School back when the school was, to be quite frank with you, lacking the technology and shops <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1735.339s">And</a>  Lena was one of the key people that stood up back some 20, 25 years ago about improving the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1744.303s">So</a>  she was a leader in that aspect and now we see a school that is really state of the art and one we can all be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1752.866s">The</a>  Curtis Tufts High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1754.629s">Lena</a>  realized early on when that program came about that not every child has the opportunity to go on to college, not every child does well in high school, and this was an opportunity that was given to students that may not get their diploma if the Curtis Tufts did not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1772.269s">And</a>  you can count on Lena being there at every Thanksgiving meal that they had, and she was a strong advocate of the Curtis Tufts Alternative High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1782.274s">She</a>  was a big supporter of the fine arts department, in particular the high school band. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1787.516s">She</a>  was the past president of the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1791.178s">She</a>  was instrumental in the building of the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1793.8s">I</a>  served with Lena when we built the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1796.982s">And</a>  if you think that wasn't a tough time, that was a difficult time going from neighborhood schools to having centralized schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1806.408s">And</a>  Lena was one of the educational leaders in this community that led the charge, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1813.633s">She</a>  also served with distinction as PTA president for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1818.855s">She</a>  was selected by the directors of the Mass Association of School Committees, Incorporated, and received the association's Lifetime Achievement Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1827.897s">Lena</a>  received the Woman's Achievement Award from the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1831.819s">She</a>  was a recipient of the Tip of the Hat Award from the Salem Street Business Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1837.32s">She</a>  received the Golden Mustang Award for supporting the students of the Mustang athletic programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1843.222s">She</a>  was instrumental in the planning and development of the Gene Mack Youth Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1847.808s">She</a>  received the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post-1012 Award in appreciation of leading the charge to have the McGlynn School Auditorium named in honor of the veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1858.568s">She</a>  was honored at the Curtis Tufts Alternative High School graduation for many years of continued support. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1864.732s">She</a>  received the Tony Lucci Golden Mustang Award for being an outstanding athletic program supporter. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1871.657s">She</a>  served as past president of AARP, the method chapter 1132. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1878.041s">And</a>  the list goes on and on and it really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1881.842s">And</a>  I'm not going to mention everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1883.943s">I</a>  would be remiss at this time because Lena's late husband, Al, as we all know him as affectionately, was a big part of <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1895.486s">uh,</a>  Lena, uh, during the years that I served with her on the school committee, and he was a recognized Purple Heart recipient, uh, from the Korean War, and, uh, along with their three children that were all graduates of Medford High School, uh, she raised a beautiful family, Mr. President, along with her role as an advocate <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1915.467s">in</a>  this community, and not just with the schools, with many, many organizations that I mentioned here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1923.918s">And</a>  it is with great pride, Mr. President, that I offer this resolution to Lena as an outstanding member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1933.51s">and</a>  I can attest to that, serving with her for six years, but also an outstanding member of this community and, in my opinion, a very, very good friend to many people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1944.912s">And</a>  I would ask, as a resolution here tonight, that the school department dedicate, in her honor, something within the public schools to show the appreciation of her service, 30 years of service, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1962.796s">One</a>  quick story I remember when I first got on the school board, when we were looking to do the new schools, they invited the school committee to go around to the buildings to see the condition of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1974.162s">And</a>  I'll never forget some of the meetings I attended and some of the buildings we went in, seeing Lena climb up to the roof of the Franklin School was quite an interesting sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1987.93s">And</a>  it was one of the many things that she took her job so serious, she could have easily said I'm not interested in going to the roof of this old rickety building and standing on the top of the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1999.659s">And</a>  there wasn't a staircase leading up there, by the way, it was a ladder. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2004.502s">And</a>  she found it in herself to get up there because that's how interested she was and how dedicated she was to making sure that her vote was predicated on <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2015.67s">doing</a>  the right thing, and making sure that she had first-hand knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2019.452s">And</a>  I learned a lot from her in that spirit of time that I served with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2024.275s">And</a>  I would ask that something be named, Mr. President, with the school department, to honor Lina DeGentimaso for her three decades of service to this community.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2035.361s">Outstanding.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2036.161s">I,</a>  for one, I've known Lina since I was probably 13, 14 years old in Upper House many times, because I was very friendly with her daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2045.486s">And</a>  good woman, I still see her occasionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2049.469s">And</a>  remember, Lena worked at the hilltop. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2055.492s">He</a>  never waited in line when Lena was working. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2057.814s">He</a>  always went in and saw Lena, and she got you right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2061.796s">Those</a>  were the old days when you had to wait for days to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2064.478s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2066.819s">I</a>  think we have a few people, Mr. President, that would like to say anything further. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2080.198s">Name</a>  and address of the record please.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2082.724s">Figure</a>  it might sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2084.729s">They</a>  might sell.</p>

    <p>[0HXibsUvumY_SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2091.167s">First</a>  of all, congratulations, President Caraviello and Vice President De La Rosa. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2098.411s">And</a>  Happy New Year to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2101.532s">I</a>  had the pleasure of working with Lena on many, many community projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2108.876s">As</a>  Councilor Mark said, if there was something happening in the city, you can be sure that Lena was gonna be involved in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2117.921s">And</a>  although she has <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2122.088s">over</a>  time received quite a lot of significant recognitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2129.48s">I</a>  wholeheartedly support your proposal and I think one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2135.949s">most</a>  prestigious awards that she received was from the Massachusetts Association of School Committee when she was given the Lifetime Achievement Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2147.754s">I</a>  don't believe any other person in this city ever was honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2153.777s">And</a>  also, I believe she was the first woman, now that women are in the newspapers these days, she was the first woman to receive the Golden Mustang Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2166.238s">And</a>  my working with her very, very closely during the founding and development of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gym, Lena was just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2182.444s">I</a>  mean, if she decided she was going to do something, she was actually the driving force behind our fundraising efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2190.827s">And</a>  over the years, I would say, I know for a fact, that's where she headed that up, every one of the fundraisers were hugely successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2202.312s">And</a>  without a doubt, she raised in excess of $100,000 through the fundraising campaigns. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2211.596s">And</a>  all of that money was given <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2216.592s">She</a>  raised over $100,000 for both the theater and the Boys and Girls Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2222.036s">And</a>  all of that money has been given to those operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2226.779s">So</a>  City of Medford can be very, very proud that Lena was a part of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2233.663s">And</a>  I certainly, as I say, I certainly would <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2241.198s">like</a>  to see something happen to give her an honor from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2247.122s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2249.003s">I</a>  also was contacted today by some friends who worked alongside of Lena and myself and that couple was Bruce and Amy Folk. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2264.004s">They</a>  are currently in the process of moving from Cotting Street to Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2270.405s">But</a>  she sent me an email and asked me if I would read this on her behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2277.787s">Bruce</a>  and I have known Lena DiGiandomaso for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2282.108s">First</a>  got to know her through the Friends of Chevalier and GMAC Gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2287.469s">We</a>  worked together on various committees and many fundraising ventures. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2292.478s">Lena's</a>  dedication and devotion to the City of Medford and the young people of the City is a tribute for us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2301.148s">Her</a>  strength, her enthusiasm, her hard work, her eagerness, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2306.693s">always</a>  to be there whenever anything or anyone had a question or needed anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2312.016s">Lena</a>  would always be there to listen and help whenever possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2316.319s">Lena</a>  always insisted on doing and getting the best for our city of Medford, and especially the young people of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2325.124s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2333.987s">I</a>  along with Michael had the honor and privilege of serving with Lena on the school committee and I think one of her greatest accomplishments was when we decided to beef up the vocational school and do a few things that were unconventional at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2353.768s">I</a>  said to Lena, why don't we see if we can institute a culinary arts program? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2358.189s">And</a>  through a lot of arm bending and work behind the scenes, it became a fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2363.991s">And</a>  just last month, Council, you and I had the opportunity to see what that program, how it started, and where it is today with their brand new cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2374.435s">Lena</a>  and I were fortunate enough in 2010 to be granted life membership in the Mass Association of School Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2381.277s">And</a>  during my tenure on the school board, I think there was no person that offered more help, more insight, and had some great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2390.404s">And</a>  like people have said, she was always there for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2394.146s">That</a>  was her first priority, even long after her own children were gone from Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2398.529s">and</a>  I would hope that you would pass this on to the new school committee and see that they act with due diligence and name something respectfully after Mr. DeGentomaso. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2408.615s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2428.969s">I'm</a>  just wondering where the time went. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2432.071s">On</a>  a lighter note, when I first ran for the school board back in 1985, Lena and I were battling out for the sixth seat on the school board. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2441.658s">Election</a>  night, I won by one vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2444.22s">She</a>  had a recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2445.28s">I</a>  ended up losing by one vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2447.601s">Came</a>  back the following time, was elected, and I had a great run. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2453.222s">Best</a>  to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2454.082s">It</a>  was a pleasure serving with Michael and all my former colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2459.544s">I</a>  wish Mrs. DeGentimaso well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2461.584s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2470.852s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2471.232s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2472.093s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2472.574s">Ken</a>  Crouch, 50 Mystic Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2475.056s">I'm</a>  a member of the board of directors of the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2479.5s">I</a>  got to know Lita when I started to get involved with the Friends, probably around 2004 or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2487.067s">And</a>  it's been a few years since she stepped down from her active role with the Friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2492.732s">Also</a>  the school committee, but it's never too late to say thank you to somebody for all their contributions to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2501.997s">And</a>  I think it's especially fitting this year for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2505.019s">One</a>  is the 25th anniversary, 2018, of the founding of the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2512.298s">As</a>  was mentioned, Lena had an important role. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2514.841s">I</a>  don't know if she was a founding member, probably was, but very instrumental in bringing the theater back from a condition that was, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2525.519s">deplorable</a>  and perhaps, you know, in jeopardy of the theater remaining as a viable venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2534.686s">And,</a>  you know, look where it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2538.109s">You</a>  know, she was an advocate for the city to invest in the building, well, to save the building, first of all, and also invest in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2547.196s">For</a>  the state legislature to approve significant funding for the renovations and was instrumental in the fundraising on behalf of the Friends as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2560.092s">So,</a>  you know, she really believed in the theater and its viability as a <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2568.762s">venue</a>  that would bring economic vitality to the community and be a place for outstanding performances for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2578.149s">So</a>  working hand-in-hand with the commission, they brought really Chevalier to the point where we see what's happening with it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2588.538s">You</a>  know, a lot of the naysayers said, oh, it's too big to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2594.242s">No</a>  company would ever come in here and run it without, you know, being paid a fortune. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2599.264s">And</a>  no company would ever come in and essentially pay the city for the opportunity to use this venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2605.186s">And</a>  look what's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2606.706s">Bill</a>  Blumenreich presents, entered into an agreement with the city this fall and is investing <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2612.708s">his</a>  own money, putting in a sound system, putting in new lighting, putting in new box office facilities, improving the sight lines, putting up money to bring in top-notch shows that are selling out this theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2628.372s">Today,</a>  the fifth performance was added for comedian Gabriel Iglesias in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2635.093s">So</a>  there are numerous shows that have already sold out and additional shows have been added. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2641.475s">The</a>  work of people like Lena, others on the Friends, others on the commission, really brought the theater to the point where it was able to take this leap to the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2652.523s">And</a>  I support whatever could be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2657.366s">to</a>  recognize Lena, particularly something at the school, and not only to thank her, but if there's something visible at the school, I think it would inspire future generations of public servants that will learn about Lena and what she contributed to the community when they pass through those halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2674.674s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2794.352s">Thank</a>  you, the purpose for this is to reserve the minimum 10% as is required under the CPA legislation in each of the program areas, and the remaining balance is to be, can be appropriated for any of the program areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2814.466s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2824.283s">Mr.</a>  President, so it's my understanding that annually 10% needs to be appropriated to each program area where the CPA was up and running, but our ordinance wasn't in place until a little bit later on in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2834.568s">I</a>  believe what happened is we were able to address fiscal year 18, but fiscal year 17 money was not appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2841.511s">So</a>  it's my understanding that by approving this appropriation will be in compliance with the community preservation.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2958.46s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2964.713s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2969.177s">So</a>  the Office of Community Development submitted a request for us to consider an off-cycle application for a project to match a federal grant rehabilitating Harris Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2987.832s">And</a>  their purpose for the off-cycle application was because the OCD anticipates that the city will have to commit the funding to complete the project during the month of January at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3008.189s">So</a>  imminently, the city is going to have to commit the resources in order to be able to accept the federal grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3016.395s">So</a>  the community preservation funds would have to be committed before any other city funds could be committed to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3025.143s">So</a>  they asked us if we would support the use of community preservation funds for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3033.55s">We</a>  felt that the project, so the community preservation application process allows for an off-cycle applicant where it is a high-priority project that has a substantial purpose for urgency that needs to be considered outside of this cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3052.827s">And</a>  we felt that this proposal, this request, met both of those criteria, that there's a reason why the funds would need to be committed before we consider the other applications in the pipeline, and this is a high-priority project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3069.913s">According</a>  to the plan that we carried out over the past six, seven months, we identified community needs through a public process, through coordinating with various departments and boards and committees and community organizations to get input about what the needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3091.962s">And</a>  some of the goals and priorities that were identified were to <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3098.985s">commit</a>  funds to serve underserved neighborhoods and populations, which this proposal does, to leverage funding from other sources, which this proposal does, to, I don't have all of the goals, but we had given previously when we came to the city council a summary of our goals and recommendations <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3126.754s">or</a>  the goals and priorities that we identified in our process, and specifically pertaining to open space and recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3133.677s">Improving</a>  access to open space and recreation resources and providing diverse recreation opportunities, serving residents of all ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3141.421s">So</a>  this project... <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3144.762s">fulfills</a>  our goals and the priority to improve access, safety, and function of our existing recreation resources, which this project does. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3156.289s">So</a>  we felt that this project meets the criteria to be considered a high priority for CPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3166.834s">The</a>  amount of city match that was requested, I believe was $516,000 to match a federal grant of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3176.116s">And</a>  given the fact that this is coming before we've had the opportunity to see what other projects are in the pipeline, we wanted to be conservative in the amount of CPA funds that we committed to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3192.3s">So</a>  we elected to match the federal grant <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3195.801s">and</a>  ask that the city find funding from other sources to match the remainder of the needs for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3205.255s">And</a>  that represents <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3209.243s">We're</a>  only for the first round of funding That we intend to recommend in May to the City Council We are looking at the FY 17 revenues that that you've just approved the reserving <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3229.091s">the</a>  program areas for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3231.012s">That's</a>  $1.2 million in total funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3234.635s">So</a>  to evenly allocate that funding between each of the three program areas would be about $400,000 for each program area. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3242.362s">So</a>  our offering or recommending $300,000 toward open space and recreation for this project <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3254.731s">is</a>  still leaves some funding available for other open space and recreation projects and to provide an even amount of funding for the three program areas altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3266.58s">So</a>  that's a long synopsis of how we got to make this recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3272.584s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3273.085s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3275.006s">Daniel,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3277.058s">Do</a>  you want to say anything?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3277.859s">No,</a>  she pretty much covered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3280.12s">But</a>  I just wanted to add that about the equal distribution of the funding, I think based on the forms, the eligibility determination forms that we've received, I believe that it's not going to be very heavy on the recreation open space projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3297.531s">So</a>  I do think that there will be price-efficient funds to go around for any recreation open space projects that were coming down the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3307.355s">as</a>  well as to fund this at $300,000.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3311.699s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that the intricacies and the inner workings of the CPA are very interesting, but people, if we're going to be spending $300,000, want to know what that $300,000 is going to go for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3321.688s">In</a>  our packet, we have a letter from our economic development planner, Clodagh Stoker-Long, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3327.673s">And</a>  this is a two-phase project, Mr. President, to rehabilitate Harris Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3331.874s">And</a>  phase one will include new play equipment for children ages two to five and five to 12, a rope climber, a water play area, a nature play area or a swing alley, a community garden, site furnishings, plantings and signage, and accessible parking improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3346.659s">Phase</a>  two will involve the rehabilitation of the fields to provide a new softball field, space for three junior soccer fields, an area for a farmer's market or a similar community use. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3354.501s">It</a>  will also include a rain garden, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3356.722s">and</a>  additional accessibility improvements and streetage improvements and plannings along the edge of Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3361.966s">Mr.</a>  President says here that the total cost of phase one, including design and construction and construction oversight is estimated at about $817,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3367.311s">The</a>  $300,000 which would be reimbursable through the Land Water Conservation Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3374.83s">And</a>  it looks like, Mr. President, if in fact this appropriation is made this evening, there'll be a $217,000 balance to complete the requirements of phase one of the project, and the city will continue to seek land and water APOC grants to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3390.575s">Phase</a>  two of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3391.736s">Mr.</a>  President seems like it's a quite an endeavor, but having been down Harris Park all fall long My kid being enrolled in soccer for the first time in his life It's a park that needs a little bit of TLC. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3402.259s">It</a>  needs a little bit of love and it's a I think a highly trafficked park Mr. President actually has a lot more access and a lot more involvement down there than most of the other parks that we see in the community so on this is an endeavor that I think needs to be <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3415.084s">examined</a>  thoroughly, but it's certainly a worthwhile cause, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3419.086s">So</a>  with that being said, I rest.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3422.248s">Councilor</a>  Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3423.388s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3423.748s">I'm</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3425.229s">Thank</a>  you for your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3426.19s">I</a>  don't know if my questions are for you or for the city, but with regards to the 300,000 that potentially will be used from CPA, is there a certain match? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3436.695s">What's</a>  the percentage of the match for the grant?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3440.735s">The</a>  land and water grant is $300,000, so the committee elected to recommend that CPA funds match the land and water grant one-to-one, so to match $300,000 for the land and water grant.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3460.166s">So</a>  how are we going to be paying? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3462.367s">This</a>  isn't a question for the CPA, but for the $217,000, what is our plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3468.611s">I</a>  think maybe the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3470.532s">I</a>  don't have it in.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3472.313s">I</a>  may close. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3473.453s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3474.454s">Office</a>  of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3479.212s">I</a>  will give you a direct answer and then I will go backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3482.634s">I</a>  spoke to the mayor today about how we would look to fund the balance of $217,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3490.879s">When</a>  we get the official confirmation from, we get it through the state of the land and water funding, we will come to you like we come again and again with a presentation asking you to accept the funding, accept the grant and to appropriate the funds <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3507.488s">the</a>  whole lot of the funds for the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3509.469s">That's</a>  the way these grant systems work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3515.154s">At</a>  that time, we will ask you to appropriate the additional $217,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3519.276s">I</a>  spoke to the mayor today and she said it's very likely that we will ask you to appropriate that from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3530.785s">That</a>  isn't definite, but that's what she said is likely.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3535.156s">So</a>  either bond or free cash, is there a potential that we'll request part of the next funding from CPA to put in another application?</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3543.964s">Is</a>  that a possibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3549.848s">Yes,</a>  I would anticipate that this is a source of funds for open space and I would anticipate that generally we will ask CPA to help.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3558.433s">with</a>  important recreational projects.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3573.211s">The</a>  open space plan is due to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3588.842s">It's</a>  been five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3589.762s">It's</a>  actually now seven, but we've gotten to the seventh. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3592.923s">So</a>  by August of this year, we need to have a new open space plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3596.644s">So</a>  we need to do the whole process of information gathering and getting goals and objectives, as well as assessing the value, the state of the various parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3608.107s">create</a>  a new list of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3611.112s">We</a>  usually just move down to the priorities that are set by that planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3617.22s">And</a>  of course the CPA has also done their own planning process, which in fact, obviously the people say the same things. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3624.731s">So</a>  very often the priorities in the open space plan are quite like those in the community preservation plan.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3632.653s">But</a>  the city would be applying for any parks that are city owned, the city would be applying for the CPA and we don't have any plans in the next year or two besides Harris Park phase one and phase two until we do the open space assessment in August, which isn't going to really lead into if there's another park that's <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3651.442s">designated</a>  as needing rehab, that would not even be until the 2019 cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3657.384s">So</a>  potentially we could put an application for the CPA funds for the second cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3672.786s">I</a>  think this is definitely a project that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3675.947s">This</a>  is exactly where I envision CPA monies going. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3679.848s">My</a>  question, putting this project aside, is how did the vote go down with regards to taking something out of cycle?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3692.607s">Our</a>  committee members voted, I believe there were eight people present at our previous meeting, all but one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3702.294s">And</a>  there was one person who voted in the negative, everyone else voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3708.539s">And</a>  his concerns were about taking this out of order, not, he felt that this was a good project, but <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3715.985s">felt</a>  uncomfortable with the very first project that we do being taken out of order or being accelerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3724.53s">Felt</a>  that if the timing were otherwise, he would get behind it very easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3729.032s">So</a>  that was a difficult decision for the committee to wrap our heads around because we want to maintain the appearance that this funding is available for anybody in the community who needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3739.277s">and</a>  that's what drove us to find an amount that we felt comfortable with leaving funds available for other applicants.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3748.524s">So</a>  can you tell the council when was the application given to the committee originally, and was a full application provided from the city?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3758.591s">Yes,</a>  we had a full application received by CLODA. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3762.093s">And</a>  when was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3763.134s">The</a>  19th? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3765.43s">It</a>  must have been the 19th.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3767.251s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3767.612s">Oh,</a>  really? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3768.072s">So</a>  very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3768.992s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3770.694s">And</a>  that's time-wise because this application for the grant is due?</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3777.238s">The</a>  grant application that was submitted originally goes through a strange sort of process. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3782.081s">Submitted</a>  to the state, who decide whether they're going to support it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3786.044s">And</a>  then they send it to the National Park Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3788.606s">And</a>  the state, so it was submitted to the state last February. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3792.228s">They</a>  decided by about, let me say, August 2 to submit it to the National Park Service with a recommendation to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3800.413s">And</a>  they tell us that they're 99% sure that we will refund it, that they have never been turned down. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3806.797s">Of</a>  course you can't, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3807.857s">It's</a>  in your hands, not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3810.519s">I</a>  expect in the next month, I can't forget, absolutely not, to get a letter saying, congratulations, you've been awarded the funding, now please go to the council and get your acceptance <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3821.865s">Sure,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3848.823s">I</a>  think I understand why you had one in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3851.926s">So</a>  it is a difficult decision, but I think this obviously needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3856.83s">So</a>  it's a hard vote, obviously, for the committee, I think, is ultimately the ones that are doing all the work and putting their time and effort and sweat and tears into how much you do is commendable. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3869.522s">I</a>  see an issue with <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3871.804s">Taking</a>  applications out of order, but I you know, I see both sides I just want to I want to just voice that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3878.507s">Yeah</a>  doing that often I don't I want to make sure that even though we have so, you know, two million come very very soon in this fund I just feel like everybody should have a fair shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3889.492s">It</a>  should be obviously I asked for an extension on the application process and I just think we're walking a fine line and I hope hopefully</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3900.959s">I</a>  appreciate that and it is also I think important to have as we wrote in the application process the opportunity for applicants to come in off cycle as this application was because there are opportunities that will be very important <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3919.901s">down</a>  the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3921.922s">Meeting</a>  a grant cycle is one example of the kind of project that might not align with what our timeline is, and if we wanted to acquire property, perhaps for open space or for affordable housing, property acquisition is often something that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3942.653s">on</a>  a very fast timeline that doesn't match. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3945.735s">So</a>  there are reasons why that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3950.179s">It</a>  was a little bit uncomfortable that this was our first application. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3953.842s">So</a>  even though we anticipated that we were going to need to be able to consider applications out of order, we weighed very carefully this particular one.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3965.59s">In</a>  my last question, I guess, or point, has the committee discussed, like you just mentioned, a few scenarios where you'd have to take them out of order when you have a grant or you have a land acquisition. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3976.395s">Have</a>  you discussed or created a checklist of why you would take <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3982.998s">an</a>  application out of order, just so it's something to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3986.603s">And</a>  when you come back to us next time, we know, oh, you know, you're trying to acquire this piece of land, or there's a grant that needs to be written in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3995.252s">I</a>  mean, just so we can feel better about this decision as well, confirming your vote.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4000.798s">At</a>  the moment we have, and perhaps it's a little bit informal and we could improve on the procedure, but we did specify that it should be a high priority project and that there should be a defensible reason why it needs to be considered off-cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4017.682s">Those</a>  were the only two criteria that we considered at this point, but we would take suggestions if there are further criteria that we ought to include in our process.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4027.784s">I</a>  would just think maybe at your next meeting you designate 10-15 minutes to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4033.245s">I</a>  think anything given to you by the mayor's office or anybody, any organization, their project is going to be high priority.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4041.188s">High</a>  priority by the standards that are established in our plan, not by necessarily the urgency felt by the applicant.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4052.188s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4052.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4082.376s">for</a>  the sixth, fifth, this Friday for the eligibility determination forms for the first round. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4090.139s">And</a>  for the second round of funding, which will also be recommended in 2018, but in the fall, the project eligibility deadline, I believe is in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4100.123s">I</a>  think it's April 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4101.783s">Yes,</a>  April 13th.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4103.264s">One</a>  of the big pieces, I know, being part of the recreation committee that we put together, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4109.627s">I</a>  think we should really pay close attention to making sure that part of these projects in the parks have inclusionary equipment for our special needs students. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4122.015s">Is</a>  that spelt out in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4123.876s">I</a>  don't know if the city can address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4126.057s">I</a>  know the water is nice, but one thing that we talked about at the recreation meetings, we're trying to make more inclusionary parks and accessibility for our children.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4136.084s">This</a>  is a preliminary design, it's a concept plan, but any design we do is fully accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4141.646s">I</a>  mean that has been for many, many years.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4143.287s">Right,</a>  but it would be what was expressed in those meetings more of adaptive equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4148.61s">So</a>  a child with a wheelchair with special equipment.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4152.012s">When</a>  we get the grant we will be coming to you.</p>

    <p>[_Zabvvh8vxM_SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4155.405s">You</a>  will have an opportunity to have that input, just like last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4160.848s">It</a>  was the same funding source last year for Riverside Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4164.11s">We</a>  came to you, made comments, we tried to see if we could do some adaptations to make things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4169.873s">Similarly,</a>  when we get this, we'll come before you and we'll have the same interactive process.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4174.595s">But</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4174.975s">And</a>  again, I think this is what people were looking for when we, Roberta, started the dialogue with community preservation and looking into such important projects like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4188.808s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4192.003s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4193.244s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4197.486s">Roberta,</a>  you mentioned about other projects that are in the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4202.849s">At</a>  what point will this council see other projects that are in the pipeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4209.212s">and</a>  be able to see, in my opinion, to be helpful to see a comparison of what funding is available, what projects are in the pipeline, because it's great to get these projects piecemeal, and everyone supports, Harris Park is around the corner from my home, I know it needs work, everyone supports this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4228.372s">but</a>  I also think it's important that we know what's out there, and there may come a time when you appear before us that we'd say, you know what, we realize this is important, but I also think creating more affordable housing in the city is equally as important, and maybe I'd like to pay more attention to that at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4248.723s">So</a>  at what point will we see as a council the total picture?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4253.525s">Do</a>  you have the full timeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4258.42s">We</a>  have in the <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4263.685s">We</a>  have a timeline laid out of when all of the applications are due and when we anticipate bringing our full slate of recommendations for the first round and the second round of funding to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4278.074s">So</a>  we can keep you updated as we've received the applications as to what's in the pipeline and there would be a public process and hearings that occur with our committee <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4290.882s">prior</a>  to our sending the recommendations or committing the recommendations to you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4298.691s">Is</a>  this the only application that you received from the city so far for the first round?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4306.118s">This</a>  is the only full application that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4309.38s">So</a>  far the eligibility determination forms are just more or less an intent to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4317.865s">We</a>  initially had the deadline for the eligibility forms due prior to when this application was discussed by our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4328.951s">Now</a>  the eligibility determination forms are due in the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4334.334s">So</a>  before we meet again, we'll know what applications are potentially in the pipeline.</p>
