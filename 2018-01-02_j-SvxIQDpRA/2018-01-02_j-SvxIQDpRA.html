    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=0.431s">It's</a>  a shell that, when it bursts in the sky, it has 35 of these gold-glittering comets in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=8.401s">And</a>  the glitter kind of looks like if you ground up 18-karat gold and pixie-dusted it into the sky, and it twinkles when it descends. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=17.572s">It</a>  ignites the burst charge at its full apex up in the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=21.615s">That</a>  burst charge also ignites the stars. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=25.077s">And</a>  just as you think that the comet is going to extinguish and go out, it then splits again and it creates this dust effect at the tail end of the burn. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=36.664s">It's</a>  something that's special to me and also the rest of the family when you see that shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=41.167s">It's</a>  also a tribute and a remembrance of my dad.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=49.942s">Jimmy</a>  Guzzi once told me about making fireworks, that an accident was always vaguely in the back of the mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=56.57s">You</a>  live with it every day, he told me, sort of like knowing that nuclear weapons are pointed at you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=68.113s">My</a>  second great-grandfather started our business in Bari, Italy in 1850. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=75.276s">They</a>  immigrated to Ellis Island in the early 1900s and they set up a factory literally six, seven miles from where we're sitting here today on Long Island. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=85.139s">And</a>  they operated their factory until about the late 1920s, 1929. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=90.463s">My</a>  grandfather, he opened his own factory in 1929 right in this very village, Bellport Village. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=97.148s">So</a>  he had three children. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=98.509s">He</a>  and my grandmother had three children, which was the fourth generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=102.492s">And</a>  my father was the oldest. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=105.434s">And</a>  he was somewhat the innovator at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=109.677s">I</a>  remember the days of being at Coney Island at five, six years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=113.84s">And</a>  it got into my blood. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=116.222s">I</a>  mean, I was with my dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=118.163s">The</a>  show would go off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=119.064s">All</a>  the people would come up, clap, you know, tell him, have a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=121.846s">And</a>  it's addictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=123.287s">And</a>  that, to me, at five years old, the energy, the camaraderie of being with a group of people, the ability to create something and see so many people enjoy it, it's addictive. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=134.214s">And</a>  at that time, I knew from as long as I can remember that this is what I wanted to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=142.367s">And</a>  then in 1983, unfortunately, we had the explosion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=145.51s">On</a>  a Saturday of a Thanksgiving weekend, the Gucci's plant exploded. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=149.913s">Debris</a>  from this blast drifted down on townships 10 miles away. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=155.558s">Jimmy</a>  Gucci had been working on the big shells he loved to make, big eight-inch color shells, though he was always a bit anxious about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=164.216s">He</a>  and his cousin, a pretty dark-haired girl who was Jimmy's assistant, were instantly killed only a few feet from the shop where they were working on the big shelves. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=174.376s">Something</a>  must have happened in there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=185.871s">We</a>  lost everything, you know, we lost two loved ones and lost our entire facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=190.654s">There</a>  was a lot of activity, there was a lot of shoes to fill, there was a lot of space to fill because there was a big gap that was caused by losing him. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=199.198s">So</a>  I kind of took the role of trying to fill his shoes and still am trying to fill his shoes.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=209.824s">Good</a>  morning, fireworks by Gritchy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=213.325s">Favorite</a>  firework would be a brocade Camaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=216.986s">It's</a>  a large, breaking, big willow type Camaro that would descend all the way down to the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=224.108s">And</a>  with the music and a large volley of them, it just fills the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=227.85s">It's</a>  a beautiful show.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=229.15s">I</a>  like the spectacle of the Niagara Falls. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=232.191s">You</a>  know, you have some pictures around here that you'll see the Niagara Falls coming off the entire bottom part of the Brooklyn Bridge, from the bottom of the actual bridge itself, hitting the East River down below. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=245.837s">So</a>  I'll never forget firing that shell, that exact effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=251.579s">And</a>  it still brings shivers up my spine now, thinking about it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=258.213s">I</a>  love the giant willow ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=259.996s">They're</a>  just so pretty when they come down like a waterfall. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=262.54s">It</a>  twinkles as it's coming down, and then it slowly dissipates, so it makes it really pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=267.827s">Kind</a>  of magical, I guess.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=276.602s">When</a>  somebody asks me what's my occupation, I generally would say we're in the firework entertainment business, as well as manufacturing of explosives business, because the other half of our business, about 50% of our revenue, is in manufacturing of explosives for the Department of Defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=293.408s">We</a>  make a tremendous amount of training devices, hand grenade simulators, ground bomb simulators, trip flare simulators, and things like that, as well as some components that go into live munitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=305.893s">So,</a>  I say we're a fireworks performance company as well as a manufacturer for the Department of Defense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=327.398s">This</a>  New Year's Eve, we're in the heart of the design process right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=331.341s">A</a>  project of this size has about 40,000 different cues and circuits that have to be initiated over an eight-and-a-half-minute period. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=343.288s">Do</a>  you get a sense of the aerial drone, but it's still unknown? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=349.452s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=349.632s">You</a>  absolutely have a sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=352.614s">If</a>  everything goes perfectly, what this is going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=356.707s">But</a>  there's always so many variables in a live performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=360.409s">One,</a>  rehearsal, you can't fire this whole show and then look at it and make changes in real time out in the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=368.59s">So</a>  this is the countdown towards the launching of the world record show. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=376.715s">So</a>  these are digits, sky-etching digits that are fired with a series of comets that are fired in a very tight pattern to create the digits. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=385.98s">Now</a>  you notice it's not one digit every second. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=389.742s">It's</a>  slow in the beginning, but now you'll see it picks up. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=394.765s">And</a>  it's intended to be very quiet as far as nothing in the sky. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=400.174s">And</a>  then you'll see this long tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=401.976s">This</a>  is the launching of the shell now. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=403.918s">You</a>  see this long tail. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=405.079s">The</a>  music will be playing also with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=409.803s">And</a>  then when it reaches its apex... Now each one of these... <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=420.387s">These</a>  small trails will be one 5-inch in diameter, 5-pound comet that's loaded inside of the shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=428.091s">And</a>  it's designed to burn long enough for it to come all the way down to the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=432.453s">So</a>  when you see that...</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1513.11s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and it's with great honor and great pride that I rise tonight to honor, in my opinion, someone that has done so much for this community, not only in the capacity as a member of the school committee for three decades, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1530.212s">but</a>  also as someone very involved in many, many organizations throughout the community, and someone very instrumental in leading the path on many, many initiatives in this community, of which I will mention some here tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1548.655s">I</a>  personally had the opportunity to serve with Lena DiGentimaso for six years as a member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1556.186s">It</a>  was my first time elected in this community back some years ago and when I first got on the school board it was <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1563.557s">kind</a>  of intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1565.92s">I</a>  was new to the process, new to the system, and Lena was one of the first people to put her hand out and welcome me to the school committee and really took me under her wing for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1583.141s">to</a>  show me the ins and outs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1585.182s">And</a>  I can remember my first few times being part of the negotiations when we used to have to negotiate with the teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1596.671s">And</a>  this would be a lengthy six, seven hour night. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1601.875s">We</a>  used to get in there at five o'clock, no breaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1606.118s">And</a>  you can always count on one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1609.271s">and</a>  it wasn't to settle the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1611.332s">It</a>  was the fact that Lena would cook a homemade lasagna and make sure that everyone was fed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1619.137s">That</a>  was the type of person she was. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1621.599s">She</a>  was very considerate and always thinking of others. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1627.563s">Her</a>  one goal that I found out early as a member of the school committee, she taught me, she said, Mike, no matter what happens, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1636.328s">We're</a>  here for the children of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1639.351s">We're</a>  here to make sure they get the best education possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1643.534s">And</a>  she said, my votes are always predicated on whatever is good for the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1648.298s">And</a>  I learned that early with Lena that she was very dedicated, she was very loyal, and she meant what she said. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1656.605s">She</a>  didn't go back on her word. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1658.126s">If</a>  Lena gave you her word, her word was as good as gold, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1665.755s">You</a>  know, another thing too, Lena attended every single meeting, not just with the school committee and other meetings we had, every single function that happened in this community, Lena Degentamaso was part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1682.243s">And</a>  I think that says a lot about a person's character and their commitment to doing the job that they're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1692.204s">Lena</a>  served, like I said, for three decades on the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1696.707s">Never</a>  ran or never intended to run for any other public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1702.271s">Her</a>  commitment was to the kids of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1705.853s">Never</a>  had any political aspirations other than to helping the kids of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1711.017s">And</a>  that's what she did for three decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1715.76s">Lena</a>  was also the longest serving member of the Medford School Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1720.223s">She</a>  was a strong advocate for the Medford Vocational Technical High School back when the school was, to be quite frank with you, lacking the technology and shops <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1735.339s">And</a>  Lena was one of the key people that stood up back some 20, 25 years ago about improving the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1744.303s">So</a>  she was a leader in that aspect and now we see a school that is really state of the art and one we can all be proud of. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1752.866s">The</a>  Curtis Tufts High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1754.629s">Lena</a>  realized early on when that program came about that not every child has the opportunity to go on to college, not every child does well in high school, and this was an opportunity that was given to students that may not get their diploma if the Curtis Tufts did not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1772.269s">And</a>  you can count on Lena being there at every Thanksgiving meal that they had, and she was a strong advocate of the Curtis Tufts Alternative High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1782.274s">She</a>  was a big supporter of the fine arts department, in particular the high school band. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1787.516s">She</a>  was the past president of the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1791.178s">She</a>  was instrumental in the building of the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1793.8s">I</a>  served with Lena when we built the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1796.982s">And</a>  if you think that wasn't a tough time, that was a difficult time going from neighborhood schools to having centralized schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1806.408s">And</a>  Lena was one of the educational leaders in this community that led the charge, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1813.633s">She</a>  also served with distinction as PTA president for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1818.855s">She</a>  was selected by the directors of the Mass Association of School Committees, Incorporated, and received the association's Lifetime Achievement Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1827.897s">Lena</a>  received the Woman's Achievement Award from the Human Rights Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1831.819s">She</a>  was a recipient of the Tip of the Hat Award from the Salem Street Business Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1837.32s">She</a>  received the Golden Mustang Award for supporting the students of the Mustang athletic programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1843.222s">She</a>  was instrumental in the planning and development of the Gene Mack Youth Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1847.808s">She</a>  received the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post-1012 Award in appreciation of leading the charge to have the McGlynn School Auditorium named in honor of the veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1858.568s">She</a>  was honored at the Curtis Tufts Alternative High School graduation for many years of continued support. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1864.732s">She</a>  received the Tony Lucci Golden Mustang Award for being an outstanding athletic program supporter. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1871.657s">She</a>  served as past president of AARP, the method chapter 1132. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1878.041s">And</a>  the list goes on and on and it really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1881.842s">And</a>  I'm not going to mention everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1883.943s">I</a>  would be remiss at this time because Lena's late husband, Al, as we all know him as affectionately, was a big part of <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1895.486s">uh,</a>  Lena, uh, during the years that I served with her on the school committee, and he was a recognized Purple Heart recipient, uh, from the Korean War, and, uh, along with their three children that were all graduates of Medford High School, uh, she raised a beautiful family, Mr. President, along with her role as an advocate <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1915.467s">in</a>  this community, and not just with the schools, with many, many organizations that I mentioned here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1923.918s">And</a>  it is with great pride, Mr. President, that I offer this resolution to Lena as an outstanding member of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1933.51s">and</a>  I can attest to that, serving with her for six years, but also an outstanding member of this community and, in my opinion, a very, very good friend to many people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1944.912s">And</a>  I would ask, as a resolution here tonight, that the school department dedicate, in her honor, something within the public schools to show the appreciation of her service, 30 years of service, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1962.796s">One</a>  quick story I remember when I first got on the school board, when we were looking to do the new schools, they invited the school committee to go around to the buildings to see the condition of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1974.162s">And</a>  I'll never forget some of the meetings I attended and some of the buildings we went in, seeing Lena climb up to the roof of the Franklin School was quite an interesting sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1987.93s">And</a>  it was one of the many things that she took her job so serious, she could have easily said I'm not interested in going to the roof of this old rickety building and standing on the top of the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=1999.659s">And</a>  there wasn't a staircase leading up there, by the way, it was a ladder. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2004.502s">And</a>  she found it in herself to get up there because that's how interested she was and how dedicated she was to making sure that her vote was predicated on <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2015.67s">doing</a>  the right thing, and making sure that she had first-hand knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2019.452s">And</a>  I learned a lot from her in that spirit of time that I served with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2024.275s">And</a>  I would ask that something be named, Mr. President, with the school department, to honor Lina DeGentimaso for her three decades of service to this community.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2035.361s">Outstanding.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2036.161s">I,</a>  for one, I've known Lina since I was probably 13, 14 years old in Upper House many times, because I was very friendly with her daughter. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2045.486s">And</a>  good woman, I still see her occasionally. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2049.469s">And</a>  remember, Lena worked at the hilltop. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2055.492s">He</a>  never waited in line when Lena was working. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2057.814s">He</a>  always went in and saw Lena, and she got you right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2061.796s">Those</a>  were the old days when you had to wait for days to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2064.478s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2066.819s">I</a>  think we have a few people, Mr. President, that would like to say anything further. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2080.198s">Name</a>  and address of the record please.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2082.724s">Figure</a>  it might sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2084.729s">They</a>  might sell.</p>

    <p>[May Marquebreuck]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2091.167s">First</a>  of all, congratulations, President Caraviello and Vice President De La Rosa. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2098.411s">And</a>  Happy New Year to all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2101.532s">I</a>  had the pleasure of working with Lena on many, many community projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2108.876s">As</a>  Councilor Mark said, if there was something happening in the city, you can be sure that Lena was gonna be involved in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2117.921s">And</a>  although she has <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2122.088s">over</a>  time received quite a lot of significant recognitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2129.48s">I</a>  wholeheartedly support your proposal and I think one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2135.949s">most</a>  prestigious awards that she received was from the Massachusetts Association of School Committee when she was given the Lifetime Achievement Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2147.754s">I</a>  don't believe any other person in this city ever was honored. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2153.777s">And</a>  also, I believe she was the first woman, now that women are in the newspapers these days, she was the first woman to receive the Golden Mustang Award. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2166.238s">And</a>  my working with her very, very closely during the founding and development of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gym, Lena was just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2182.444s">I</a>  mean, if she decided she was going to do something, she was actually the driving force behind our fundraising efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2190.827s">And</a>  over the years, I would say, I know for a fact, that's where she headed that up, every one of the fundraisers were hugely successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2202.312s">And</a>  without a doubt, she raised in excess of $100,000 through the fundraising campaigns. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2211.596s">And</a>  all of that money was given <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2216.592s">She</a>  raised over $100,000 for both the theater and the Boys and Girls Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2222.036s">And</a>  all of that money has been given to those operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2226.779s">So</a>  City of Medford can be very, very proud that Lena was a part of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2233.663s">And</a>  I certainly, as I say, I certainly would <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2241.198s">like</a>  to see something happen to give her an honor from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2247.122s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2249.003s">I</a>  also was contacted today by some friends who worked alongside of Lena and myself and that couple was Bruce and Amy Folk. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2264.004s">They</a>  are currently in the process of moving from Cotting Street to Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2270.405s">But</a>  she sent me an email and asked me if I would read this on her behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2277.787s">Bruce</a>  and I have known Lena DiGiandomaso for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2282.108s">First</a>  got to know her through the Friends of Chevalier and GMAC Gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2287.469s">We</a>  worked together on various committees and many fundraising ventures. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2292.478s">Lena's</a>  dedication and devotion to the City of Medford and the young people of the City is a tribute for us all. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2301.148s">Her</a>  strength, her enthusiasm, her hard work, her eagerness, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2306.693s">always</a>  to be there whenever anything or anyone had a question or needed anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2312.016s">Lena</a>  would always be there to listen and help whenever possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2316.319s">Lena</a>  always insisted on doing and getting the best for our city of Medford, and especially the young people of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2325.124s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2333.987s">I</a>  along with Michael had the honor and privilege of serving with Lena on the school committee and I think one of her greatest accomplishments was when we decided to beef up the vocational school and do a few things that were unconventional at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2353.768s">I</a>  said to Lena, why don't we see if we can institute a culinary arts program? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2358.189s">And</a>  through a lot of arm bending and work behind the scenes, it became a fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2363.991s">And</a>  just last month, Council, you and I had the opportunity to see what that program, how it started, and where it is today with their brand new cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2374.435s">Lena</a>  and I were fortunate enough in 2010 to be granted life membership in the Mass Association of School Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2381.277s">And</a>  during my tenure on the school board, I think there was no person that offered more help, more insight, and had some great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2390.404s">And</a>  like people have said, she was always there for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2394.146s">That</a>  was her first priority, even long after her own children were gone from Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2398.529s">and</a>  I would hope that you would pass this on to the new school committee and see that they act with due diligence and name something respectfully after Mr. DeGentomaso. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2408.615s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2428.969s">I'm</a>  just wondering where the time went. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2432.071s">On</a>  a lighter note, when I first ran for the school board back in 1985, Lena and I were battling out for the sixth seat on the school board. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2441.658s">Election</a>  night, I won by one vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2444.22s">She</a>  had a recount. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2445.28s">I</a>  ended up losing by one vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2447.601s">Came</a>  back the following time, was elected, and I had a great run. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2453.222s">Best</a>  to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2454.082s">It</a>  was a pleasure serving with Michael and all my former colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2459.544s">I</a>  wish Mrs. DeGentimaso well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2461.584s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2470.852s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2471.232s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2472.093s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2472.574s">Ken</a>  Crouch, 50 Mystic Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2475.056s">I'm</a>  a member of the board of directors of the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2479.5s">I</a>  got to know Lita when I started to get involved with the Friends, probably around 2004 or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2487.067s">And</a>  it's been a few years since she stepped down from her active role with the Friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2492.732s">Also</a>  the school committee, but it's never too late to say thank you to somebody for all their contributions to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2501.997s">And</a>  I think it's especially fitting this year for a couple of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2505.019s">One</a>  is the 25th anniversary, 2018, of the founding of the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2512.298s">As</a>  was mentioned, Lena had an important role. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2514.841s">I</a>  don't know if she was a founding member, probably was, but very instrumental in bringing the theater back from a condition that was, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2525.519s">deplorable</a>  and perhaps, you know, in jeopardy of the theater remaining as a viable venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2534.686s">And,</a>  you know, look where it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2538.109s">You</a>  know, she was an advocate for the city to invest in the building, well, to save the building, first of all, and also invest in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2547.196s">For</a>  the state legislature to approve significant funding for the renovations and was instrumental in the fundraising on behalf of the Friends as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2560.092s">So,</a>  you know, she really believed in the theater and its viability as a <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2568.762s">venue</a>  that would bring economic vitality to the community and be a place for outstanding performances for the arts. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2578.149s">So</a>  working hand-in-hand with the commission, they brought really Chevalier to the point where we see what's happening with it today. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2588.538s">You</a>  know, a lot of the naysayers said, oh, it's too big to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2594.242s">No</a>  company would ever come in here and run it without, you know, being paid a fortune. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2599.264s">And</a>  no company would ever come in and essentially pay the city for the opportunity to use this venue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2605.186s">And</a>  look what's happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2606.706s">Bill</a>  Blumenreich presents, entered into an agreement with the city this fall and is investing <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2612.708s">his</a>  own money, putting in a sound system, putting in new lighting, putting in new box office facilities, improving the sight lines, putting up money to bring in top-notch shows that are selling out this theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2628.372s">Today,</a>  the fifth performance was added for comedian Gabriel Iglesias in February. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2635.093s">So</a>  there are numerous shows that have already sold out and additional shows have been added. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2641.475s">The</a>  work of people like Lena, others on the Friends, others on the commission, really brought the theater to the point where it was able to take this leap to the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2652.523s">And</a>  I support whatever could be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2657.366s">to</a>  recognize Lena, particularly something at the school, and not only to thank her, but if there's something visible at the school, I think it would inspire future generations of public servants that will learn about Lena and what she contributed to the community when they pass through those halls. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2674.674s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2794.352s">Thank</a>  you, the purpose for this is to reserve the minimum 10% as is required under the CPA legislation in each of the program areas, and the remaining balance is to be, can be appropriated for any of the program areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2814.466s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2824.283s">Mr.</a>  President, so it's my understanding that annually 10% needs to be appropriated to each program area where the CPA was up and running, but our ordinance wasn't in place until a little bit later on in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2834.568s">I</a>  believe what happened is we were able to address fiscal year 18, but fiscal year 17 money was not appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2841.511s">So</a>  it's my understanding that by approving this appropriation will be in compliance with the community preservation.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2958.46s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2964.713s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2969.177s">So</a>  the Office of Community Development submitted a request for us to consider an off-cycle application for a project to match a federal grant rehabilitating Harris Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=2987.832s">And</a>  their purpose for the off-cycle application was because the OCD anticipates that the city will have to commit the funding to complete the project during the month of January at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3008.189s">So</a>  imminently, the city is going to have to commit the resources in order to be able to accept the federal grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3016.395s">So</a>  the community preservation funds would have to be committed before any other city funds could be committed to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3025.143s">So</a>  they asked us if we would support the use of community preservation funds for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3033.55s">We</a>  felt that the project, so the community preservation application process allows for an off-cycle applicant where it is a high-priority project that has a substantial purpose for urgency that needs to be considered outside of this cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3052.827s">And</a>  we felt that this proposal, this request, met both of those criteria, that there's a reason why the funds would need to be committed before we consider the other applications in the pipeline, and this is a high-priority project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3069.913s">According</a>  to the plan that we carried out over the past six, seven months, we identified community needs through a public process, through coordinating with various departments and boards and committees and community organizations to get input about what the needs are. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3091.962s">And</a>  some of the goals and priorities that were identified were to <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3098.985s">commit</a>  funds to serve underserved neighborhoods and populations, which this proposal does, to leverage funding from other sources, which this proposal does, to, I don't have all of the goals, but we had given previously when we came to the city council a summary of our goals and recommendations <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3126.754s">or</a>  the goals and priorities that we identified in our process, and specifically pertaining to open space and recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3133.677s">Improving</a>  access to open space and recreation resources and providing diverse recreation opportunities, serving residents of all ages. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3141.421s">So</a>  this project... <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3144.762s">fulfills</a>  our goals and the priority to improve access, safety, and function of our existing recreation resources, which this project does. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3156.289s">So</a>  we felt that this project meets the criteria to be considered a high priority for CPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3166.834s">The</a>  amount of city match that was requested, I believe was $516,000 to match a federal grant of $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3176.116s">And</a>  given the fact that this is coming before we've had the opportunity to see what other projects are in the pipeline, we wanted to be conservative in the amount of CPA funds that we committed to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3192.3s">So</a>  we elected to match the federal grant <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3195.801s">and</a>  ask that the city find funding from other sources to match the remainder of the needs for this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3205.255s">And</a>  that represents <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3209.243s">We're</a>  only for the first round of funding That we intend to recommend in May to the City Council We are looking at the FY 17 revenues that that you've just approved the reserving <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3229.091s">the</a>  program areas for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3231.012s">That's</a>  $1.2 million in total funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3234.635s">So</a>  to evenly allocate that funding between each of the three program areas would be about $400,000 for each program area. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3242.362s">So</a>  our offering or recommending $300,000 toward open space and recreation for this project <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3254.731s">is</a>  still leaves some funding available for other open space and recreation projects and to provide an even amount of funding for the three program areas altogether. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3266.58s">So</a>  that's a long synopsis of how we got to make this recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3272.584s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3273.085s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3275.006s">Daniel,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3277.058s">Do</a>  you want to say anything?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3277.859s">No,</a>  she pretty much covered it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3280.12s">But</a>  I just wanted to add that about the equal distribution of the funding, I think based on the forms, the eligibility determination forms that we've received, I believe that it's not going to be very heavy on the recreation open space projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3297.531s">So</a>  I do think that there will be price-efficient funds to go around for any recreation open space projects that were coming down the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3307.355s">as</a>  well as to fund this at $300,000.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3311.699s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that the intricacies and the inner workings of the CPA are very interesting, but people, if we're going to be spending $300,000, want to know what that $300,000 is going to go for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3321.688s">In</a>  our packet, we have a letter from our economic development planner, Clodagh Stoker-Long, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3327.673s">And</a>  this is a two-phase project, Mr. President, to rehabilitate Harris Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3331.874s">And</a>  phase one will include new play equipment for children ages two to five and five to 12, a rope climber, a water play area, a nature play area or a swing alley, a community garden, site furnishings, plantings and signage, and accessible parking improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3346.659s">Phase</a>  two will involve the rehabilitation of the fields to provide a new softball field, space for three junior soccer fields, an area for a farmer's market or a similar community use. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3354.501s">It</a>  will also include a rain garden, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3356.722s">and</a>  additional accessibility improvements and streetage improvements and plannings along the edge of Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3361.966s">Mr.</a>  President says here that the total cost of phase one, including design and construction and construction oversight is estimated at about $817,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3367.311s">The</a>  $300,000 which would be reimbursable through the Land Water Conservation Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3374.83s">And</a>  it looks like, Mr. President, if in fact this appropriation is made this evening, there'll be a $217,000 balance to complete the requirements of phase one of the project, and the city will continue to seek land and water APOC grants to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3390.575s">Phase</a>  two of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3391.736s">Mr.</a>  President seems like it's a quite an endeavor, but having been down Harris Park all fall long My kid being enrolled in soccer for the first time in his life It's a park that needs a little bit of TLC. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3402.259s">It</a>  needs a little bit of love and it's a I think a highly trafficked park Mr. President actually has a lot more access and a lot more involvement down there than most of the other parks that we see in the community so on this is an endeavor that I think needs to be <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3415.084s">examined</a>  thoroughly, but it's certainly a worthwhile cause, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3419.086s">So</a>  with that being said, I rest.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3422.248s">Councilor</a>  Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3423.388s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3423.748s">I'm</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3425.229s">Thank</a>  you for your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3426.19s">I</a>  don't know if my questions are for you or for the city, but with regards to the 300,000 that potentially will be used from CPA, is there a certain match? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3436.695s">What's</a>  the percentage of the match for the grant?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3440.735s">The</a>  land and water grant is $300,000, so the committee elected to recommend that CPA funds match the land and water grant one-to-one, so to match $300,000 for the land and water grant.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3460.166s">So</a>  how are we going to be paying? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3462.367s">This</a>  isn't a question for the CPA, but for the $217,000, what is our plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3468.611s">I</a>  think maybe the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3470.532s">I</a>  don't have it in.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3472.313s">I</a>  may close. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3473.453s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3474.454s">Office</a>  of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3479.212s">I</a>  will give you a direct answer and then I will go backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3482.634s">I</a>  spoke to the mayor today about how we would look to fund the balance of $217,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3490.879s">When</a>  we get the official confirmation from, we get it through the state of the land and water funding, we will come to you like we come again and again with a presentation asking you to accept the funding, accept the grant and to appropriate the funds <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3507.488s">the</a>  whole lot of the funds for the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3509.469s">That's</a>  the way these grant systems work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3515.154s">At</a>  that time, we will ask you to appropriate the additional $217,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3519.276s">I</a>  spoke to the mayor today and she said it's very likely that we will ask you to appropriate that from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3530.785s">That</a>  isn't definite, but that's what she said is likely.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3535.156s">So</a>  either bond or free cash, is there a potential that we'll request part of the next funding from CPA to put in another application?</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3543.964s">Is</a>  that a possibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3549.848s">Yes,</a>  I would anticipate that this is a source of funds for open space and I would anticipate that generally we will ask CPA to help.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3558.433s">with</a>  important recreational projects.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3573.211s">The</a>  open space plan is due to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3588.842s">It's</a>  been five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3589.762s">It's</a>  actually now seven, but we've gotten to the seventh. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3592.923s">So</a>  by August of this year, we need to have a new open space plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3596.644s">So</a>  we need to do the whole process of information gathering and getting goals and objectives, as well as assessing the value, the state of the various parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3608.107s">create</a>  a new list of priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3611.112s">We</a>  usually just move down to the priorities that are set by that planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3617.22s">And</a>  of course the CPA has also done their own planning process, which in fact, obviously the people say the same things. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3624.731s">So</a>  very often the priorities in the open space plan are quite like those in the community preservation plan.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3632.653s">But</a>  the city would be applying for any parks that are city owned, the city would be applying for the CPA and we don't have any plans in the next year or two besides Harris Park phase one and phase two until we do the open space assessment in August, which isn't going to really lead into if there's another park that's <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3651.442s">designated</a>  as needing rehab, that would not even be until the 2019 cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3657.384s">So</a>  potentially we could put an application for the CPA funds for the second cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3672.786s">I</a>  think this is definitely a project that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3675.947s">This</a>  is exactly where I envision CPA monies going. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3679.848s">My</a>  question, putting this project aside, is how did the vote go down with regards to taking something out of cycle?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3692.607s">Our</a>  committee members voted, I believe there were eight people present at our previous meeting, all but one. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3702.294s">And</a>  there was one person who voted in the negative, everyone else voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3708.539s">And</a>  his concerns were about taking this out of order, not, he felt that this was a good project, but <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3715.985s">felt</a>  uncomfortable with the very first project that we do being taken out of order or being accelerated. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3724.53s">Felt</a>  that if the timing were otherwise, he would get behind it very easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3729.032s">So</a>  that was a difficult decision for the committee to wrap our heads around because we want to maintain the appearance that this funding is available for anybody in the community who needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3739.277s">and</a>  that's what drove us to find an amount that we felt comfortable with leaving funds available for other applicants.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3748.524s">So</a>  can you tell the council when was the application given to the committee originally, and was a full application provided from the city?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3758.591s">Yes,</a>  we had a full application received by CLODA. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3762.093s">And</a>  when was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3763.134s">The</a>  19th? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3765.43s">It</a>  must have been the 19th.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3767.251s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3767.612s">Oh,</a>  really? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3768.072s">So</a>  very recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3768.992s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3770.694s">And</a>  that's time-wise because this application for the grant is due?</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3777.238s">The</a>  grant application that was submitted originally goes through a strange sort of process. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3782.081s">Submitted</a>  to the state, who decide whether they're going to support it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3786.044s">And</a>  then they send it to the National Park Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3788.606s">And</a>  the state, so it was submitted to the state last February. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3792.228s">They</a>  decided by about, let me say, August 2 to submit it to the National Park Service with a recommendation to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3800.413s">And</a>  they tell us that they're 99% sure that we will refund it, that they have never been turned down. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3806.797s">Of</a>  course you can't, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3807.857s">It's</a>  in your hands, not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3810.519s">I</a>  expect in the next month, I can't forget, absolutely not, to get a letter saying, congratulations, you've been awarded the funding, now please go to the council and get your acceptance <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3821.865s">Sure,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3848.823s">I</a>  think I understand why you had one in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3851.926s">So</a>  it is a difficult decision, but I think this obviously needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3856.83s">So</a>  it's a hard vote, obviously, for the committee, I think, is ultimately the ones that are doing all the work and putting their time and effort and sweat and tears into how much you do is commendable. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3869.522s">I</a>  see an issue with <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3871.804s">Taking</a>  applications out of order, but I you know, I see both sides I just want to I want to just voice that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3878.507s">Yeah</a>  doing that often I don't I want to make sure that even though we have so, you know, two million come very very soon in this fund I just feel like everybody should have a fair shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3889.492s">It</a>  should be obviously I asked for an extension on the application process and I just think we're walking a fine line and I hope hopefully</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3900.959s">I</a>  appreciate that and it is also I think important to have as we wrote in the application process the opportunity for applicants to come in off cycle as this application was because there are opportunities that will be very important <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3919.901s">down</a>  the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3921.922s">Meeting</a>  a grant cycle is one example of the kind of project that might not align with what our timeline is, and if we wanted to acquire property, perhaps for open space or for affordable housing, property acquisition is often something that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3942.653s">on</a>  a very fast timeline that doesn't match. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3945.735s">So</a>  there are reasons why that can happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3950.179s">It</a>  was a little bit uncomfortable that this was our first application. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3953.842s">So</a>  even though we anticipated that we were going to need to be able to consider applications out of order, we weighed very carefully this particular one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3965.59s">In</a>  my last question, I guess, or point, has the committee discussed, like you just mentioned, a few scenarios where you'd have to take them out of order when you have a grant or you have a land acquisition. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3976.395s">Have</a>  you discussed or created a checklist of why you would take <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3982.998s">an</a>  application out of order, just so it's something to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3986.603s">And</a>  when you come back to us next time, we know, oh, you know, you're trying to acquire this piece of land, or there's a grant that needs to be written in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=3995.252s">I</a>  mean, just so we can feel better about this decision as well, confirming your vote.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4000.798s">At</a>  the moment we have, and perhaps it's a little bit informal and we could improve on the procedure, but we did specify that it should be a high priority project and that there should be a defensible reason why it needs to be considered off-cycle. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4017.682s">Those</a>  were the only two criteria that we considered at this point, but we would take suggestions if there are further criteria that we ought to include in our process.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4027.784s">I</a>  would just think maybe at your next meeting you designate 10-15 minutes to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4033.245s">I</a>  think anything given to you by the mayor's office or anybody, any organization, their project is going to be high priority.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4041.188s">High</a>  priority by the standards that are established in our plan, not by necessarily the urgency felt by the applicant.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4052.188s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4052.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4054.709s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4055.429s">And</a>  again, thank you, your team doing a great job with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4059.27s">And</a>  we all know how Harris Park, the work it needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4062.991s">I</a>  know that I receive phone calls right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4066.612s">People,</a>  you know, what about car park? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4068.952s">What</a>  about the baseball fields? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4070.152s">And</a>  this is this is great because that's a dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4073.153s">And</a>  we express to people that I believe the deadline is coming up soon for the new round. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4079.855s">The</a>  15th, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4080.535s">January.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4082.376s">for</a>  the sixth, fifth, this Friday for the eligibility determination forms for the first round. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4090.139s">And</a>  for the second round of funding, which will also be recommended in 2018, but in the fall, the project eligibility deadline, I believe is in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4100.123s">I</a>  think it's April 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4101.783s">Yes,</a>  April 13th.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4103.264s">One</a>  of the big pieces, I know, being part of the recreation committee that we put together, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4109.627s">I</a>  think we should really pay close attention to making sure that part of these projects in the parks have inclusionary equipment for our special needs students. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4122.015s">Is</a>  that spelt out in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4123.876s">I</a>  don't know if the city can address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4126.057s">I</a>  know the water is nice, but one thing that we talked about at the recreation meetings, we're trying to make more inclusionary parks and accessibility for our children.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4136.084s">This</a>  is a preliminary design, it's a concept plan, but any design we do is fully accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4141.646s">I</a>  mean that has been for many, many years.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4143.287s">Right,</a>  but it would be what was expressed in those meetings more of adaptive equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4148.61s">So</a>  a child with a wheelchair with special equipment.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4152.012s">When</a>  we get the grant we will be coming to you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4154.133s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4155.405s">You</a>  will have an opportunity to have that input, just like last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4160.848s">It</a>  was the same funding source last year for Riverside Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4164.11s">We</a>  came to you, made comments, we tried to see if we could do some adaptations to make things work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4169.873s">Similarly,</a>  when we get this, we'll come before you and we'll have the same interactive process.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4174.595s">But</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4174.975s">And</a>  again, I think this is what people were looking for when we, Roberta, started the dialogue with community preservation and looking into such important projects like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4188.808s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4192.003s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4193.244s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4197.486s">Roberta,</a>  you mentioned about other projects that are in the pipeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4202.849s">At</a>  what point will this council see other projects that are in the pipeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4209.212s">and</a>  be able to see, in my opinion, to be helpful to see a comparison of what funding is available, what projects are in the pipeline, because it's great to get these projects piecemeal, and everyone supports, Harris Park is around the corner from my home, I know it needs work, everyone supports this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4228.372s">but</a>  I also think it's important that we know what's out there, and there may come a time when you appear before us that we'd say, you know what, we realize this is important, but I also think creating more affordable housing in the city is equally as important, and maybe I'd like to pay more attention to that at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4248.723s">So</a>  at what point will we see as a council the total picture?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4253.525s">Do</a>  you have the full timeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4258.42s">We</a>  have in the <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4263.685s">We</a>  have a timeline laid out of when all of the applications are due and when we anticipate bringing our full slate of recommendations for the first round and the second round of funding to the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4278.074s">So</a>  we can keep you updated as we've received the applications as to what's in the pipeline and there would be a public process and hearings that occur with our committee <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4290.882s">prior</a>  to our sending the recommendations or committing the recommendations to you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4298.691s">Is</a>  this the only application that you received from the city so far for the first round?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4306.118s">This</a>  is the only full application that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4309.38s">So</a>  far the eligibility determination forms are just more or less an intent to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4317.865s">We</a>  initially had the deadline for the eligibility forms due prior to when this application was discussed by our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4328.951s">Now</a>  the eligibility determination forms are due in the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4334.334s">So</a>  before we meet again, we'll know what applications are potentially in the pipeline.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4339.421s">My</a>  question, Roberta, is on behalf of the city, is this the only application you've received so far on behalf of the city as a city entity?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4349.313s">This</a>  is the only application that we've received because the deadline is not until March. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4353.678s">but</a>  for eligibility termination forms, we were free something.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4357.621s">No</a>  one else asked for early acceptance? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4359.323s">No</a>  one else said?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4360.023s">No,</a>  no, because I don't think anyone else is on a timeline where they have to get a match before their grant is awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4365.448s">I'm</a>  not sure what the other funds that are being leveraged for the other projects, but we have received forms from the Community Garden Commission for four different gardens. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4377.798s">I</a>  don't believe that they're gonna apply for all four, but they wanted to, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4382.322s">make</a>  sure that they want to get it out there first, make sure that it's eligible, and then decide later which ones to apply for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4391.486s">So</a>  they applied. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4393.167s">We</a>  have the Historical Commission has submitted, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4399.089s">was</a>  seven or nine eligibility termination forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4402.852s">They</a>  also don't intend to submit full applications for all of those, but they, for planning purposes, to get all their ducks in a row, to have several month lead time to know which ones are worth filling out a complete application form to know what's eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4419.684s">And</a>  we also are expecting one from the mayor's office for the condon shell. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4425.567s">But</a>  those are the ones that I know offhands that are City of Medford projects.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4434.72s">As</a>  Council Lungo-Koehn mentioned, knowing that there's a set amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4442.387s">Do</a>  you think that we're opening the floodgate to other recipients or potential recipients saying, you know what, we don't want to sit back and wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4452.635s">We</a>  want to make ours as urgent as everyone else, get in there early, do what we have to do to be ahead of the curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4460.762s">Do</a>  you think we open ourselves up for that by accepting something before?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4467.737s">My</a>  sense from talking with other committee members is that they feel very conservative about considering an off-cycle application, that they want to see a very <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4485.722s">defined</a>  legitimate purpose for the off-cycle application, that the reason why the funding would need to be committed prior to when everybody else's funding is committed, there's a hard outside <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4503.207s">deadline,</a>  externally imposed deadline that drives that early application. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4509.108s">It's</a>  not just that they thought of it before everyone else, but it's because something else from outside is causing them to have to make that commitment now as opposed to later. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4520.691s">And</a>  as I said, it's only something that we would consider for something that meets the high priority as defined in the planning process that we undertook. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4532.294s">So</a>  the possibility is there, but I think that unless that external deadline applies to a project, they're going to be asked to get in the regular stream on cycle with the other applicants.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4558.231s">Councilor</a>  Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4559.212s">Mr.</a>  President, I think we need to be certain of our intentions here because we're committing ourselves to a portion of this project needs and there still remains a balance of $176,000, $177,000 nearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4582.298s">I'm</a>  correct in reading this 217 that we've been informed by someone <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4591.097s">who</a>  may or may not be authorized to inform us of that, that it's going to be asked for from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4598.322s">So</a>  I hope when it comes time to make that expenditure that we'll go through with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4605.206s">Secondly,</a>  I wonder sometimes if, since there's been such a call in the past to not pass these proposals that are sent to us for the first time, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4621.255s">why</a>  that concern isn't being raised, but I am in favor of this, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4627.043s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4630.872s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4633.154s">One</a>  question about the applications. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4635.576s">The</a>  applications or the forms that do come in, are those gonna be public, go public? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4640.199s">Are</a>  we gonna be able to check them out online before you discuss them?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4644.183s">Yes,</a>  it's all public information, so I was waiting until the deadline this Friday to aggregate everything and put it at least on the preservedbedford.org website. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4655.632s">Oh,</a>  on your website, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4657.413s">Yes,</a>  we would host it and have them all there.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4664.344s">And</a>  then just through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4668.415s">I'm</a>  not sure the city said we were definitely gonna be taking this out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4671.877s">It</a>  sounded like we, it's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4675.72s">But</a>  will we be putting in, I guess, will we be putting in another application for CPA funding for the remaining? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4683.765s">Not</a>  for this project.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4684.645s">I</a>  mean, not for phase one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4686.826s">Not</a>  for phase one, but for phase two, potentially, for the 217,000.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4688.908s">At</a>  that stage, we should be on time because <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4694.938s">We</a>  should not be out of cycle, although we won't know if we're likely to get a grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4699.528s">For</a>  instance, if there's a funding cycle, we'll say from the park program in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4713.486s">I</a>  wouldn't get the decision from the park program, you know that the CPA couldn't make their decision with all the other decisions and then when the park program came through we could put it all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4728.219s">I</a>  think that this will be the only major off-cycle application because I think they will be anticipation rather than having a very good idea if you're getting matching funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4738.342s">But</a>  for instance, I could, for instance, make an application for park funding in March, also make a CPA for the following October, and usually park funds, you're told about October and November if you're getting them. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4752.427s">So</a>  it would line up in a different way than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4754.767s">This</a>  is an exceptional circumstance. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4756.848s">Because</a>  this is the first year of the CPA All that Okay, I think thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4762.593s">I</a>  think I read it wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4763.454s">I</a>  thought both phases were the 817 and you wouldn't need the 217 till phase two, but I guess it I Look at the sentence again. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4773.122s">So</a>  phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4775.083s">Do</a>  we know how much that is gonna cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4776.625s">I</a> </p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4777.212s">There's</a>  a concept plan, and again that looks at the moment about $600,000, but that's phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4785.556s">We</a>  have to deal with phase one first. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4787.237s">That's</a>  what we're pursuing at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4795.22s">When</a>  we did the, last February when we did the concept for the whole park, then we realized we'd have to divide it into two pieces because the grants that are available generally are in the $300,000 to $400,000 range, and also they're reimbursable usually, and park grants, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4819.19s">Land</a>  and water, which we're hopefully getting for this, is a 50% reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4824.094s">So</a>  for instance, to get 300, you need to spend at least 600 of what they call eligible expenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4831.88s">At</a>  the moment, park is 60% reimbursement, so the figure is related. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4843.308s">So</a>  to answer your question, I think this is phase one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4846.746s">817,000</a>  is phase one.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4847.306s">But</a>  that also includes design and construction oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4851.869s">Very</a>  often when we come to, we have already funded design or we've started the design, and very often when we get to a stage, and it's usually a major problem for us, when we go into construction, we have no money for construction oversight, and we have no contingency, and we are really in a bind. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4871.118s">The</a>  proposal is to properly fund this so that we can actually do the project.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4881.924s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4883.767s">Clota.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4886.251s">In</a>  previous grants that we've received, matching grants, we always had to show where we're gonna get the funding from, correct?</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4895.802s">That's</a>  what happens when we come to you, when we get the letter saying we're awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4902.746s">We</a>  come to you and when you do the vote, you will vote to accept the grant and to appropriate the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4911.192s">And</a>  that's one vote and that has to be sent to the state before they will actually sign the grant contract.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4917.595s">But</a>  I just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4920.597s">When</a>  you say accept the funds, that is from the matching grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4925.78s">So</a>  we have to vote to accept the matching grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4928.002s">But</a>  we also have to take a vote to approve this tonight, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4932.564s">And</a>  when you go back to apply for the matching grant, all you're going to have at that particular time is what we're voting on tonight, and that doesn't cover the full project.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4942.73s">Yes,</a>  so when we come to you, we'll say in a month or six weeks, we will be asking you for another $217,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4949.532s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4950.192s">I</a>  understand that, but are you going to be, between now and then, are you going to be applying for the... No, I've applied for it.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4959.674s">You</a>  put in the application, and then you wait till they say, here we are, we're going to award it to you, and then we come to you, because there's no point in asking you for money if we don't know we're getting a match, because you've got to say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4973.597s">So</a>  that's the way when we know we're getting the money then we come to you to say please accept the grant and front the total amount.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4983.082s">So</a>  what's the urgency of voting on this tonight then?</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4988.965s">The</a>  CPA money has to be allocated in advance of us coming to you with the grant application because once <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=4997.33s">Once</a>  the city allocates money, then it cannot be replaced with CPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5004.457s">And</a>  that's why you have to get the CPA in place first.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5009.062s">What</a>  happens if the other $200,000 doesn't come to fruition? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5012.866s">We're</a>  in trouble.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5016.273s">We</a>  need the project, the council is basically the body who controls whether this project will happen or not, because they approved funds.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5024.355s">And</a>  you're saying phase two is another 600,000, so we're looking at about a million?</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5029.076s">At</a>  the moment, that's not designed or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5031.497s">We'll</a>  be looking to come maybe next year for phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5036.478s">This</a>  is hypothetical at the moment, but I'm trying to be as direct as I can, telling as much as I know.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5045.919s">So</a>  why aren't we being asked to vote for the free cash tonight also? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5049.862s">I</a>  mean, if you're going to get a commitment to use funds for CPA, so that means this body supports the concept, why wouldn't we be asked to... We could have done that, but you might be reluctant to do that when you haven't got the grant in your hand.</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5068.396s">You</a>  know, when you appropriate the money then, you've appropriated on the off chance, I don't believe this for a second, we didn't get the park grant, sorry it's land and water, then you would have allocated money. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5084.27s">It</a>  gives you a sense of security that the project is definitely going to happen before you allocate the additional funds.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5094.745s">And</a>  if we don't get the grant, that money just goes back into the CPA?</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5100.867s">I</a>  don't believe for a second that we won't get the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5102.808s">I've</a>  been told by the coordinator of the state that she's 99% sure, but she cannot absolutely say it until she gets the letter.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5112.24s">I</a>  just wanted to answer, if the funds, if CPA funds are appropriated for a project and not used for that project, they can be returned to the pool that's available for other projects.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5126.693s">Shall</a>  be returned, yes.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5130.896s">You</a>  can always vote to rescind back to the category in which you programmed the money.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5141.299s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5155.127s">That's</a>  actually why we specifically tell you which bucket it's coming out of, so that we know which bucket to put it back into should it ever occur on this or any future project.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5164.597s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5164.937s">I</a>  just wanted to get confirmation, just because it seemed, the way you said it, it just seemed funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5168.881s">But</a>  I just wanted to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5169.862s">So</a>  it goes back into the same bucket it came out of, and it can be used.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5174.427s">the</a>  future for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5175.488s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5176.929s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5177.509s">I</a>  mean, this is I mean, I've been down to Harris Park a number of times, and I think it's definitely a park that needs some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5185.996s">We</a>  have a lot of parks that need some work, but I know that that park does need a lot of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5189.778s">And</a>  I think it's definitely a worthy project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5191.84s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5194.522s">Councilor</a>  McGrath.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5195.403s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5196.804s">I</a>  just want to check in on this $817,000 figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5199.626s">Is</a>  that what you're submitting to the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5205.131s">Can</a>  that change at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5206.193s">I</a>  mean, could it go down or could we reduce the project at all?</p>

    <p>[Clodagh Stoker-Long]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5211.281s">What</a>  we applied to the state for, let me see, something like, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5216.367s">I</a>  think it was $667,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5218.388s">You</a>  can only get $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5219.049s">The</a>  maximum grant available in this cycle is $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5225.392s">So</a>  you have to apply for at least $600,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5230.615s">And</a>  it has to be eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5231.936s">And</a>  there are things that are not eligible that you need in a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5235.738s">For</a>  instance, construction oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5237.88s">The</a>  Clerk of the Works is not an eligible expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5241.362s">Police</a>  details are not an eligible expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5244.123s">So</a>  if you spend that, you have to have money for that because the state will not reimburse that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5251.287s">And</a>  that's why the money is more.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5261.392s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5262.753s">Mr.</a>  President, I as one member of this body, very excited to see that the CPA is moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5267.395s">I</a>  think that when the CPA ballot question was put on, put to the test for the voters, that this is what they envisioned happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5274.939s">It's</a>  what I envisioned happening as well, where the community comes together and they put together a plan and work together to come up with a goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5280.722s">And</a>  I really think this is a great plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5282.362s">I</a>  think it's a bold plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5283.863s">It's</a>  an expensive plant, but I think it's worthwhile, and I think it's a project that deserves to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5290.526s">It</a>  has great merit. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5291.907s">So</a>  for those reasons, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5809.024s">Yes,</a>  thank you again, Ken Krause, 50 Mystic Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5812.286s">I</a>  wanted to speak in support of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5814.948s">I'm</a>  pleased to hear that the city has responded so quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5821.192s">I</a>  think the need has increased recently, and particularly, as you've heard, we're doing a lot of investing in our parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5830.338s">Our</a>  squares, we have a very active Walk Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5836.463s">We</a>  have a very active bicycle commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5840.206s">The</a>  Mr. Grover Watershed Association is putting a lot of emphasis behind completing the Mystic Greenways network. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5849.174s">Some</a>  of those trails that we're seeing come online are <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5854.678s">responsibility</a>  of the city, some are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5857.159s">So</a>  this will be helpful where we need to use the device at the parks and the trails that we're responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5865.481s">But</a>  we're just going to be seeing a lot more people using the sidewalks and using the trails where this will be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5875.244s">I'm</a>  glad to see this is brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5876.825s">And</a>  also, I know from my past experience with the transition team on the recreation subcommittee, we got a tour of all the parks from Mike Nestor, the park foreman. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5890.272s">And</a>  he had said at that time that for a number of years, he has been strongly advocating for this type of a machine as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5896.496s">So</a>  I know it'd be very welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5898.577s">One</a>  of the things he pointed out, in addition to its value and utility, currently the city has to, or at least when we spoke two years ago, use a bobcat primarily for removing the snow from sidewalks and places like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5912.027s">And</a>  that requires another truck and a trailer to take it and deliver it to the site to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5918.932s">Whereas</a>  this type of machine is completely independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5922.195s">It</a>  can run on its own and doesn't require the need for the truck and the trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5928.099s">The</a>  last question I had, and this kind of goes along the lines of urgency for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5934.023s">I'm</a>  glad we're thinking about it for next year's budget, but perhaps it could come even sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5938.245s">And</a>  my question would be, is this something that could be possibly eligible for linkage fee money to be used on? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5946.09s">We</a>  hear a lot about linkage fees when they're required for developments and a lot of developments are residential and they bring into the community a lot of people that use the sidewalks and use the paths, a lot of younger people, a lot of people that are bicycle users. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5963.299s">All</a>  kinds of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5964.98s">And</a>  the linkage process is sort of mysterious to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5970.864s">It's</a>  just a resident who, you know, tries to pay attention to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5975.627s">I</a>  rarely see, if ever, <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5978.028s">Any</a>  kind of meetings where they talk about the linkage money you'll see on the Zoning Board of Appeals meetings This is this project requires linkage money But we never really hear how much came in and where it goes and what it's what it's used for I think maybe correct me if I'm wrong that the council might even have a seat on the linkage committee that decides to <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5998.868s">point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=5999.568s">Point</a>  of information Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6001.869s">The</a>  president of the City Council is ex officio, a member of the linkage committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6010.333s">And</a>  during my two year tenure as president, we met three times in properly noticed meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6021.773s">do</a>  we call the minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6023.274s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6023.995s">I'll</a>  investigate. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6024.676s">It's</a>  good to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6025.216s">And</a>  I think under Mayor Burke, we, no, I never met, maybe I met once under Mayor McLennan. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6031.662s">I've</a>  had a couple. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6032.603s">Under</a>  Mayor Burke, we've probably spent a good portion of it down on this type of stuff, the type of stuff of parks, public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6041.231s">It's</a>  parks, public safety, and one more.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6045.094s">Infrastructure</a>  related to the development that comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6047.835s">So</a>  my point was that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6048.595s">I</a>  think I've had a couple Ken.</p>

    <p>[Krause]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6050.116s">It</a>  could be eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6051.136s">I</a>  would like to know as a citizen what kind of money is available and if this is eligible because if we don't need to put it in next year's budget, then perhaps that money could go toward additional personnel for the DPW because perhaps this will be utilized a lot and can't be used for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6069.903s">Yeah,</a>  no, I'm saying that this, if we buy the machine with linkage money, we could use the budget money for personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6076.006s">I</a>  know we can't use linkage money for personnel, so just wanted to raise that as a possibility to expedite, hopefully getting this machine sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6084.391s">So</a>  thank you, Councilor Falco, for bringing that up.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6089.053s">Councilor</a>  Locren. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6090.054s">Maybe</a>  just as a side paper, we can get an update of how much money is in the linkage account currently.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6279.848s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6284.926s">number</a>  of new personnel that are coming on here in the community and this council's commitment to diversity and to inclusion in the city as well as that of the administration and the hiring of a new director of Diversity I think that it only makes sense for us mr. President to continue building upon the positive progress that we've made in the past When Diane McLeod was the director of the office of diversity she did have annual trainings for our city employees whether it was <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6309.913s">a</a>  training module on the computer or a presentation, Mr. President, but I think it was very beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6313.615s">And</a>  I think it's something that doesn't, that should be pushed by the wayside. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6316.777s">So</a>  I'm asking the administration to take the appropriate steps to provide the council with a cost analysis as to what it costs to provide an annual diversity training for the city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6325.662s">And</a>  then we can take appropriate steps to determine whether or not we want to codify this as an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6329.504s">I</a>  request that it be done by executive order to ensure that it continues, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6333.407s">So</a>  I'm asking my council colleagues to support this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6336.049s">so</a>  that we can get a little bit more information about what it costs for us to be able to implement an annual diversity training for our city employees.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6343.924s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor De La Russa, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6348.468s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6349.369s">18-014</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request directed patrols to enforce resident access restrictions on Hastings Lane with particular focus on the morning and evening commuting hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6364.943s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6366.405s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President, unfortunately the Waze app has found Hastings Lane and there are many vehicles that would come from Winchester and cut right down Woburn Street and follow Woburn Street all the way to the end and then cross over to High Street and go right down Hastings Lane even though it says resident access only between 7 to 9. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6383.339s">It's</a>  becoming a problem in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6384.64s">There</a>  are many young families that live in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6386.56s">It's</a>  not an easy street to get up and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6388.681s">Portions</a>  of it are unpaved. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6389.821s">Portions</a>  of it are paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6391.722s">Certain</a>  portions wouldn't allow two cars to traverse at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6395.843s">And</a>  this lack of conscientiousness by certain commuters is causing an issue in the neighborhood, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6402.585s">On</a>  Christmas Eve, I had the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6404.806s">to</a>  visit a family friend over there, like I do every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6407.987s">And</a>  the conversation that I had with every member of the family revolved around the number of cars that are going down the street during the hours that they're not supposed to be going down there, never mind the speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6418.069s">So</a>  I'm asking, Mr. President, for the Traffic Division to do a directed patrol at Hastings Lane, either at the top at High Street or at the bottom down on Parkway, while the restrictions are in place, to see if we can catch some people going through the Do Not Enter sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6432.872s">If</a>  a person goes down a restricted access street like that, when they go down that street, that is a moving violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6437.455s">It's</a>  a surchargeable offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6438.935s">It</a>  goes on your registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6440.016s">It</a>  goes on your insurance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6441.537s">So</a>  for individuals that want to save five minutes cutting down a street, they have to realize that that five minutes that they're saving could cost them $700 a year for the next seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6451.142s">I</a>  think that, you know, there's a lack of conscientiousness and just ignorance, Mr. President, when it comes to some of these signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6455.765s">And</a>  I think we're all guilty of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6456.846s">We've</a>  all gone down a sign that might have said, you know, resident access only before. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6460.968s">I</a>  know I've done it on rural ave before. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6463.17s">We've</a>  all done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6464.07s">But</a>  ultimately, it's causing an issue in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6466.091s">It</a>  needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6466.832s">And</a>  I'm asking for some help from our police department.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6469.673s">If</a>  I can amend that to ask if the police department has a way of contacting Waze to have them come down and put them on notice of the signs on different streets.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6483.941s">I</a>  don't know if Waze has a... I would certainly be open to amending the paper as a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6488.503s">I</a>  just don't want them to say that we can't contact Waze so we're not going to do the directive patrol. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6492.825s">So</a>  as long as it's a B paper and they have two separate tasks to move on, I'd be happy to do it, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6498.087s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, I was just gonna mention that I know he has</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6511.468s">some</a>  sort of contact or some way to reach out to ways he's done it in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6514.87s">And</a>  this is definitely something that I think we should definitely push in his direction, have him look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6520.693s">It</a>  definitely needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6522.294s">It's</a>  amazing what that app has done to our city streets in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6527.837s">And</a>  while we're on the topic, just to mention really quick, tomorrow night at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital School of Nursing is our next <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6536.281s">community</a>  police meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6537.322s">I</a>  just wanted to bring that up, but I thought it was appropriate to bring it up now, since we are talking about this issue here, and a lot of issues like this here are discussed during that type of meeting.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6736.486s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6737.827s">Michael</a>  and I were very close friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6739.227s">Michael</a>  was a mentor to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6740.928s">He</a>  taught me a great deal about how government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6743.609s">And</a>  I think when you look at Michael Callaghan and his career in government, especially as a resident here of Medford who's been credited with the legend of saving Wrights Pond from development, his slogan in the 2005 Senate campaign summed up Michael Callaghan. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6758.575s">And</a>  Michael Callaghan helped people. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6759.996s">He</a>  helped people. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6760.976s">That's</a>  what Michael did, and I sadly miss Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6763.156s">I'd</a>  ask my colleagues to join me in a moment of silence and to dedicate tonight's meeting in his memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=6768.337s">Please</a>  rise.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7228.618s">the</a>  smog and the fog and the pollution has gripped the airport and not many people have been getting in and out of the city so not a great new year start I'm afraid to say.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7237.442s">No</a>  indeed I do worry for your health when you join us on Business Matters Rahul because I know you go out to the street because you get a better signal to be able to broadcast but you do have to breathe in all of the fumes of the traffic.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7247.97s">I</a>  know, but it's now the cold air here, I'm afraid. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7250.373s">It</a>  may be 20 degrees, but I have to say, quite a comical sight in Kolkata at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7254.779s">It</a>  looks like a convention of bank robbers, as everybody's wearing these monkey caps, balaclavas, shivering in 20 degrees, I'm afraid to say here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7264.25s">Sounds</a>  terrible, as we're about 15 degrees colder. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7268.931s">Talk</a>  to me about one of these stories that you've been looking at, which is to do with Indian doctors not very happy with the government because it is offering, or considering offering, a short kind of bridging course to homeopaths and others trained in alternative medicines that would allow them to become doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7289.036s">It's</a>  being called sanctioned quackery.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7292.223s">Yes,</a>  indeed it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7293.164s">And</a>  you know, this is not the first time the idea has been considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7296.887s">And</a>  whilst a lot of doctors of yesterday went on a strike in private hospitals, others in public hospitals were wearing black armbands to say, look, what a ludicrous idea this is, what the government and actually some other people involved in the medical profession say is, India has a huge problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7313.521s">It</a>  does not produce enough doctors. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7315.983s">And</a>  not only does it not produce enough doctors, but if you go into the rural sector of the country, many doctors don't want to go and stay there because they say the facilities aren't good enough for their children in terms of education, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7327.673s">So</a>  what's going to happen to the health needs of these people? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7330.735s">You</a>  can't suddenly create, you know, double the number of doctors overnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7335.119s">So</a>  you have to find some sort of interim solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7338.381s">And</a>  that's what this idea has always been, that you take people <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7341.704s">who</a>  practice medicine, these sort of quacks that exist up and down this country, and give them a little bit more professional training. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7349.268s">Look,</a>  they're operating anyway, a lot of people say, so, you know, give them some medical skills so that they're able to cope with basic emergencies, so that people in those areas can actually have some sort of medical <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7362.814s">treatment</a>  when they need it in those situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7365.955s">I</a>  mean doctors on the other hand say look you know this is just not the right way to do it but I have to say you know when I go to rural India you see quacks performing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7375.577s">They</a>  are being used by a lot of people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7378.137s">I</a>  think there is a lot of critics and a lot of others who say you have to give some sort of medical facilities to people so let's try this method out because at the moment you have millions and millions of people in India who have no access to health care.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7392.64s">Indeed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7393.581s">Another</a>  story which is in the Times of India today. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7397.103s">The</a>  number of visitors to the Taj Mahal is to be capped at 40,000 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7401.647s">Why</a>  is that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7403.988s">I</a>  think it is just the damage that the sheer number of people who are visiting the Taj Mahal, you know, cause. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7410.653s">I</a>  mean, I've been there on public holidays to India's most famous monument, one of the greatest monuments in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7418.999s">You</a>  know, and you can have 60, 80,000 people who are turning up. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7423.501s">And</a>  there's been a long debate about how do you protect, you know, India's iconic building. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7429.183s">And</a>  I think now this is why they've decided that at least for Indians, there's going to be 20,000 in the morning, 20,000 in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7435.746s">Once</a>  they cross that figure, you just won't be able to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7438.807s">The</a>  good news for all the foreign tourists is no restrictions on them, but obviously they pay far more than Indians. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7445.27s">Anyway,</a>  and I think it's part of a much wider debate whether you're talking about India's, when India's looking at tourism, about how to protect it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7453.315s">I</a>  mean, the tigers are another thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7455.776s">I</a>  mean, how do you protect the national parks from the huge number of people who are coming in? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7459.899s">And</a>  I think India's looking at a much more long-term vision when it comes to tourism now, because it's not about getting people in over the next 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7467.023s">It's</a>  about the next 50, 100 years about how you develop it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7470.084s">So</a>  I think we could see more things like this at other sites in India as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7474.567s">Is</a>  this controversial with many people that Indians are going to be restricted in numbers visiting an Indian monument, yet foreigners won't?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7484.193s">I</a>  think that once it comes in, it probably will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7486.954s">And</a>  I think it's about communicating that information accurately to people, because often when you go to the Taj, you know, you'll see people who come from miles and villages, a lifetime's moment to go and see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7498.781s">And</a>  if they turn up and find out that it's shut or it's going to be shut to them, I'm sure they are going to get pretty angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7505.544s">I</a>  think it's about getting that information out. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7507.745s">A</a>  lot of people still turn up at the Taj Mahal, foreigners and Indians, on a Friday, even though it's closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7513.206s">So</a>  I think it's getting that information out. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7515.207s">But</a>  certainly, if you've spent a lot of money getting there as an Indian, and you're restricted to get in, and you see foreigners going in, well, you may get annoyed. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7523.309s">But</a>  there is a little loophole there. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7525.29s">If</a>  you do want to go in, if you pay the foreigners' rate, whether you're a foreigner or not, you will be allowed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7530.451s">The</a>  problem is, for many Indians, that's just going to be way too expensive.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7533.272s">Indeed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7533.793s">Interesting.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7534.193s">Thank</a>  you, Rahul. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7534.954s">Get</a>  back indoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7535.935s">Get</a>  out of all that fumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7537.316s">Clearly</a>  got the back of your throat a bit earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7539.418s">Good</a>  to talk to you as always. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7540.439s">That's</a>  the BBC's Rahul Tandon there in Calcutta in India.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7546.885s">And</a>  they called it puppy love.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7553.311s">How</a>  much is that hound dog in the window? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7558.384s">I</a>  do hope that fleabag's first.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7570.449s">We</a>  are going doggy crazy on Business Matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7574.251s">Various</a>  songs, I'm sure you'll recognise that. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7575.912s">I</a>  won't ask Andrew People and Bridget Bodnar to name every single song, that would be unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7580.055s">But</a>  we are going to discuss something called Paternity Leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7585.238s">We've</a>  discussed over the years on Business Matters the various pet-friendly policies that companies <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7590.961s">have</a>  brought in, but this is a new related trend. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7594.563s">Lots</a>  of employees of course take maternity, paternity leave when they have a baby or adopt a child, but now many companies are offering paternity leave for pet owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7604.609s">It</a>  is where employees are allowed to take time off when they get a new dog. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7609.252s">It</a>  started among US technology startup businesses, but it seems to be spreading. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7614.315s">A</a>  brewery in Ohio has introduced the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7617.177s">It's</a>  the appropriately named Brew Dog USA. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7620.299s">I've</a>  been talking to the boss, Tanisha Robinson, and I asked her about her own four-legged friends.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7626.263s">I</a>  actually have three dogs. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7629.145s">We</a>  have a pit bull hound mix, a chihuahua, and a pomeranian. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7633.809s">So</a>  about 90 pounds of dogs, but in the form of three creatures.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7639.083s">And</a>  so why did you decide then to introduce Pawternity? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7641.985s">Was</a>  this because you yourself wanted some time off?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7645.068s">No,</a>  I don't have any new dogs on my horizon, which is now post the introduction of Pawternity Leave, but we feel that it's a great benefit to offer our team when they introduce a new family member, whether it's a human or canine member of the family, so that people can take time to bond.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7664.003s">It's</a>  not just because you've got the word dog in the name of the company.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7668.871s">Well,</a>  I mean, our company was founded by two humans and one dog ten years ago, so that is certainly an important component of our business.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7677.24s">What</a>  is the benefit of doing this? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7679.222s">Because</a>  you don't offer it for people who get a new cat or a new rabbit or something, do you? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7683.947s">So</a>  why have you decided to introduce it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7687.709s">We</a>  want to be the best place to work on the earth ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7691.852s">And,</a>  you know, dogs have a special place in the history of our business. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7695.374s">And</a>  certainly, you know, someone who's horribly allergic to cats, you know, I think dogs are truly a man's best friend.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7703.158s">How</a>  much time then can people take off?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7705.32s">People</a>  get a week off. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7706.681s">They</a>  bring a new dog into their family.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7708.942s">And</a>  it's paid?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7710.143s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7711.063s">How</a>  many people have made use of this then so far?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7713.465s">So</a>  on our US team, we've had four people take paternity leave so far.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7718.129s">What</a>  do the colleagues of people with dogs make of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7721.05s">Because</a>  if you don't have a dog, of course, you're not entitled to it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7724.571s">Well,</a>  they certainly have the opportunity to be entitled to it if they adopt a dog or bring a new dog into their family. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7730.533s">But</a>  we also are a dog-friendly office space, so there's a lot of love for dogs in our business.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7736.833s">Do</a>  you think it's only a certain type of company that does and will offer this kind of leave for employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7743.914s">Because</a>  some people still grumble they get too few holidays, never mind being able to take time off to look after a pet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7751.296s">At</a>  BrewDog, it's really important for us to take great care of our people. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7756.057s">Our</a>  two most important things in our whole business are our people and our beer. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7760.278s">And</a>  for us, that means letting people spend some time bonding with a new puppy if they get one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7765.966s">You</a>  said you also let people bring dogs to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/j-SvxIQDpRA&t=7769.235s">Do</a>  they not cause a nuisance in the office, wandering in during meetings or demanding they go for walkies when you're on a deadline or something?</p>
