22
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:57,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council reinforces the ordinance requiring door-to-door solicitors

23
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:02,427
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, to sign in with the clerk's office and we're identification.

24
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:11,951
[SPEAKER_07]: There has been several break-ins in different neighborhoods and abundance of door to door salesmen selling everything from magazines, windows, roofing, and solar panels.

25
00:01:12,532 --> 00:01:13,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Cavill.

26
00:01:13,692 --> 00:01:14,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

27
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:23,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I would just like to ask the city reinforce the audiences that we have in place already, uh, regarding these door to door salesmen that are coming around right now.

28
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:34,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I've been hearing stories from many different neighborhoods, and there's people roaming the neighborhoods, and there's been a lot of neighborhood break-ins.

29
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:41,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when they come to my own house, I ask them for identification, and they look at me like there's something wrong with me.

30
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:51,893
[SPEAKER_02]: I would ask that the police, and if they get called, to ask these people to leave the neighborhoods, and let's see.

31
00:01:53,217 --> 00:02:02,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Any companies coming into the city to sell things, that they please register with the clerk's office and get the proper identification and follow whatever rules that we have in place already.

32
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor and Councilor Caraviello.

34
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Martins.

35
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:21,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Just if I could, Mr. President, if someone happens to come to your home and they're doing door-to-door solicitation, my recommendation would be if they don't have a badge or a proper ID,

36
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:45,805
[SPEAKER_03]: that the person find out where this person is from that's knocking on the door, contact the city clerk's office, and let the city clerk's office know where this person was from, and then the city clerk's office can reach out and let them know that we have a city audience that requires door-to-door solicitors to have proper identification, Mr. President.

37
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:47,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that would be my recommendation.

38
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:48,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

39
00:02:48,686 --> 00:02:51,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the motion is approved by Councilor Caraviello and seconded by Councilor Marks.

40
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:53,055
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

41
00:02:53,755 --> 00:02:54,536
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

42
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:55,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

43
00:02:57,818 --> 00:03:00,560
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for suspension of the rules by Councilor Knight.

44
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:01,962
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

45
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:03,483
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

46
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:06,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, you wish to suspend the rules for what purpose?

47
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:09,648
[SPEAKER_07]: For the motion to take papers.

48
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:23,428
[SPEAKER_07]: 16, 020, 021, 022, and 023.

49
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Off the table for discussion.

50
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,010
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

51
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:29,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

52
00:03:29,631 --> 00:03:30,391
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

53
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:31,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

54
00:03:33,032 --> 00:03:34,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

55
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:41,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Several weeks, just a couple weeks ago, the administration put a paper forward for an ordinance change relative to a reorganization of the executive office.

56
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:44,756
[SPEAKER_05]: This council had some questions that needed to be answered.

57
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,998
[SPEAKER_05]: We had in our packets this week response to the questions that we had asked.

58
00:03:49,799 --> 00:04:00,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd ask the current budget director to maybe come up and go over the response that the administration sent forward to us, and maybe we can get these papers off of the list of unfinished business this evening, Mr. President.

59
00:04:01,424 --> 00:04:01,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

60
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:02,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

61
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

62
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Louise Miller, currently Chief Procurement Officer.

63
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:13,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you need my address?

64
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:14,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry?

65
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:15,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you need my address?

66
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:16,069
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

67
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

68
00:04:18,226 --> 00:04:19,947
[SPEAKER_07]: 100 George P. Hassett Drive.

69
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:23,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

70
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

71
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:28,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

72
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:35,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor Burke sent us answers to our questions on Friday.

73
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:43,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost everything is answered, except in the chart, it just doesn't have any names.

74
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,262
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you were here, Louise, last week.

75
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:56,858
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, A through F, and then along with the current versus the proposed personnel, we asked for, you know, who is who.

76
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:59,219
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

77
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,260
[SPEAKER_10]: Did she, I don't know if anybody else got one with names.

78
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to, it's, I'm sure it's easy to do.

79
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:09,442
[SPEAKER_10]: There's only about six or seven positions.

80
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,363
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that something maybe you could outline for us?

81
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:11,923
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

82
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:16,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe if you could give us the names of the people in these positions.

83
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:16,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

84
00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:20,286
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not sure if I know everyone's last name.

85
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:21,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

86
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:22,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

87
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:23,948
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

88
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:26,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Secretary to the mayor is Linda Coletti.

89
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief of staff is Teresa Walsh.

90
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:35,794
[SPEAKER_14]: Assistant to the chief of staff is Janine Camuso.

91
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:40,097
[SPEAKER_14]: Executive assistant constituent services

92
00:05:44,118 --> 00:05:45,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Is Lauren Felch?

93
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,720
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

94
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Executive Assistant Cultural and Business Liaison is Amy Scroi?

95
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:53,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Amy Scroi?

96
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:56,086
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pronounced Scroi.

97
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,387
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pronounced Scroi.

98
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,249
[SPEAKER_07]: S-G-R-O-I.

99
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,955
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Executive Assistant of Cultural and Business Liaison.

100
00:06:13,052 --> 00:06:14,173
[SPEAKER_07]: That is correct.

101
00:06:14,493 --> 00:06:16,615
[SPEAKER_07]: This position right here in the chart.

102
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:20,978
[SPEAKER_14]: It is the step one position.

103
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:29,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie Scroi, Annie Scroi, S-G-R-O-I.

104
00:06:29,865 --> 00:06:30,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie or Amy?

105
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:31,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie.

106
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:32,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Annie.

107
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you're the?

108
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,712
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not on the chart.

109
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,318
[SPEAKER_10]: You're on the second part of the chart.

110
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:44,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Proposed Chief Procurement Officer and Budget Director?

111
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:44,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

112
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:44,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

113
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:52,828
[SPEAKER_10]: You weren't here last week when we met in Committee of the Whole either, I mean, because that's probably when I would have asked the question.

114
00:06:52,848 --> 00:07:02,857
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you could answer us as best you can, I'm sure I'm going to know the answer you're going to give, but you really feel that you could handle both positions?

115
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Budget and procurement, yes.

116
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

117
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:13,791
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you're able to be responsive to, you know, you're able to handle all the emails, phone calls, and those two jobs together?

118
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:14,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

119
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:16,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you probably can handle it.

120
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:23,298
[SPEAKER_10]: I just feel like we've always had in the past, up until this past year, somebody just full-time in procurement.

121
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:29,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I feel like maybe budget isn't a full-time job year-round, but I'm sure you're doing things year-round.

122
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:33,646
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know, you know, May, June is probably very overwhelming.

123
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,228
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to make sure you truly feel that you can handle

124
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:37,585
[SPEAKER_10]: both.

125
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:40,646
[SPEAKER_14]: So the answer is yes.

126
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:52,891
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's actually a nice synergy between budget and procurement since procurement isn't responsible for all the contracts and for all the purchase order purchase order purchases for the city as well as the school department.

127
00:07:53,751 --> 00:08:02,194
[SPEAKER_14]: It really lends itself very nicely to the budget function because half the budget is being procured by the procurement officer.

128
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And what do you have for help?

129
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:05,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have a secretary?

130
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,269
[SPEAKER_14]: I have one staff person.

131
00:08:07,309 --> 00:08:09,070
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a clerk, a full-time clerk.

132
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that almost like secretarial or a little less?

133
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:18,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's equivalent.

134
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:26,318
[SPEAKER_10]: And then with regards to the chief of staff,

135
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:31,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just doing some research with regards to just the salary, because that's going to be $106,420.

136
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:32,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Where do we come up with that?

137
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:38,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Malden, I feel like, is comparable to the city of Medford.

138
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:41,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And Malden's chief of staff for 2015 is in the budget for $82,964.

139
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:44,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's more than $20,000 more than, say, Malden's chief of staff.

140
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:45,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Boston and Somerville have

141
00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:59,234
[SPEAKER_10]: They're larger communities, especially Boston.

142
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:03,397
[SPEAKER_10]: They have the largest salary in and around the $100,000 range.

143
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:15,387
[SPEAKER_10]: But when you compare Chief of Staff in Malden to Chief of Staff in Medford, I just question that with regards to the $104,000 difference between Malden and Medford.

144
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:20,251
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not know what the responsibilities are for the Chief of Staff in Malden.

145
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:24,635
[SPEAKER_14]: In Medford, it would be the personnel function as well as policy.

146
00:09:25,821 --> 00:09:26,461
[SPEAKER_14]: for the mayor?

147
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:36,064
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be my only concern with the whole thing.

148
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:44,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the mayor has the absolute, you know, right to put in the people she believes are going to help administer the city.

149
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:52,948
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel, you know, I don't necessarily know all her picks, but I wish them well and I hope they lead to great things.

150
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,886
[SPEAKER_10]: concern is that $106,000 for chief of staff.

151
00:09:58,386 --> 00:09:59,606
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like that's high.

152
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:00,127
[SPEAKER_10]: You have Ms.

153
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:05,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Miller doing two jobs for almost the same amount.

154
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:16,030
[SPEAKER_10]: They range, from what I looked up on the budgets, from $45,000 to I think Somerville's $98,000 or Malden's $82,000, Taunton's $42,000, Fall River's $78,000.

155
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:24,310
[SPEAKER_10]: So that seems a little high.

156
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,553
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be my only concern with the number of papers that are before us, the four different papers.

157
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wanted to voice that concern.

158
00:10:33,456 --> 00:10:35,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

159
00:10:35,898 --> 00:10:37,839
[SPEAKER_16]: The Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

160
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,681
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can, thank you very much.

161
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:42,843
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate the Mayor getting back to us with all this information.

162
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:46,666
[SPEAKER_16]: As you can see, I'm taking this very serious.

163
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,608
[SPEAKER_16]: My wife wants to know if I'm going for my doctorate degree.

164
00:10:50,538 --> 00:11:04,787
[SPEAKER_16]: I've compiled a bunch of different data from different communities, Malden, Revere, Somerville, Cambridge, Chelsea, and talked to a few chief of staffs myself today.

165
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:13,972
[SPEAKER_16]: What Revere is doing is very similar to ours, which is the chief of staff slash personnel, and he's in the roughly $108,000.

166
00:11:16,254 --> 00:11:19,636
[SPEAKER_16]: If you look at Somerville and their chief of staff,

167
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:34,243
[SPEAKER_16]: is one position, and then if you look at their purchasing director, I mean their personnel director, you're talking about a position where he's bringing in close to personnel's $109,000.

168
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:39,227
[SPEAKER_16]: So where it's $2,000, two positions, double the salary.

169
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:48,372
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see it being a problem in my eyes as the mayor's starting her own program and her own child.

170
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:49,713
[SPEAKER_16]: What I'm more concerned of

171
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:55,249
[SPEAKER_16]: and looking at the budget constraints this year where there's none.

172
00:11:56,289 --> 00:12:07,478
[SPEAKER_16]: What Councilor Falco mentioned last week, maybe giving us a heads up and understanding in the future how that's going to look.

173
00:12:07,498 --> 00:12:12,302
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's important that we see this year what we have in place.

174
00:12:12,362 --> 00:12:19,347
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know you're saying you could do two jobs, but when you're talking about a business of Medford and what's entailed here,

175
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:24,070
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think it's just, I look at Mr. Rumley's position, for instance.

176
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:35,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Neighborhood community has city solicitor, paralegal, ISD paralegal, legal secretary, and four assistant solicitors.

177
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:40,261
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just don't, and these are communities that are very similar to ours.

178
00:12:40,922 --> 00:12:48,167
[SPEAKER_16]: So I commend her with going this way and looking to save money and going forward.

179
00:12:48,798 --> 00:13:08,262
[SPEAKER_16]: If we really talk about the changes that everybody wanted going through this election year, I think it needs to be a team approach and going after it where people aren't going to be spread so thin and people are focused on one major job.

180
00:13:08,402 --> 00:13:09,643
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's important.

181
00:13:10,063 --> 00:13:14,864
[SPEAKER_16]: And granted, I'm not going to be popular when you talk about funding, but when you talk about

182
00:13:16,043 --> 00:13:18,425
[SPEAKER_16]: what neighbor communities do and how they thrive.

183
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:40,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Our chief of staff and a neighbor community could be focused more on building partnerships with outside businesses to create more revenue in our community with the tax base and bringing more jobs to Medford, where our chief of staff is focused on personnel matters on a day to day basis, which some issues as small as,

184
00:13:41,073 --> 00:13:46,075
[SPEAKER_16]: coming into the office thinking we'll take 10 minutes, we'll take six hours and there's the whole day.

185
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,616
[SPEAKER_16]: So I, you know, I appreciate the answers.

186
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:50,796
[SPEAKER_16]: The answers are right on.

187
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:52,076
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what everything we've asked for.

188
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:52,837
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate that.

189
00:13:53,317 --> 00:14:10,482
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think if we can like to make a motion that going forward that, um, we hope that the, um, look for the mayor, the mayor's office look more into more in depth in the, the positions and running a community, running a city like Medford.

190
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,431
[SPEAKER_16]: and what's really needed.

191
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:26,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Speaking for myself and working with the school department for the last six years, we saw the issues with having the principal doing the assistant principal's job to save money, and we needed it at the time.

192
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,960
[SPEAKER_16]: But we saw where it hurt us.

193
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:39,865
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is where, in the last few years, the budget was focusing, making sure that we had identified positions, focused on that position.

194
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:44,608
[SPEAKER_16]: it's making a huge difference in the day to day activities in the schools.

195
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can only imagine what happens in the city side.

196
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:57,113
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I, I appreciate all of her, all the mayor's answers and, um, and, um, that's it.

197
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:57,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

198
00:14:57,793 --> 00:14:57,973
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

199
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:00,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

200
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:00,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor.

201
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:01,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a motion?

202
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:05,236
[SPEAKER_07]: President motion to move for approval.

203
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:09,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper one six dash zero two zero on the motion of Councilor Knight for approval.

204
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:16,519
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, paper one six dash zero two zero as amended by councilor Scarpelli.

205
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

206
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

207
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:23,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

208
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:25,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

209
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:25,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

210
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:26,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

211
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:27,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

212
00:15:28,003 --> 00:15:28,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-president Kern.

213
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:29,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

214
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:30,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

215
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:31,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

216
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:32,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

217
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:33,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

218
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:34,845
[SPEAKER_04]: President Dello Russo.

219
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:35,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

220
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

221
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, it's first reading.

222
00:15:40,211 --> 00:15:44,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Most of the night motion to waive the additional readings of paper one, six dash zero to zero.

223
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:49,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President on the motion to waive the additional readings on the set paper.

224
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:57,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll council of marks before that's called Mr. President.

225
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:02,221
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I would like to speak on the fact that,

226
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:22,305
[SPEAKER_03]: The waving of readings has not really been a common practice of this council over the years, and it's been used in the past for negotiations, for city employees, and with the hope of expediting whatever contractual agreements were made between the union and the city.

227
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:31,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would caution, especially when we have a few new members of the council that, and we've all spoke about transparency,

228
00:16:31,878 --> 00:16:46,603
[SPEAKER_03]: is that anytime you waive the remaining readings, you're canceling transparency, you're canceling public debate, you're canceling the opportunity for people to appear before the council that may have a concern.

229
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:57,787
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first reading, as I'm not sure if my colleagues may or may not be aware, the first reading is when it first appears on the council agenda.

230
00:16:58,488 --> 00:16:59,328
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first reading.

231
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:01,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the first time it's up for debate and discussion.

232
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:10,575
[SPEAKER_03]: The second reading is when it's passed on to go for publication in the paper.

233
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:18,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is notification to the general public that may have not saw it on the council agenda the first time or wasn't aware.

234
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes out in the paper and it's duly advertised.

235
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,901
[SPEAKER_03]: People read it and say, you know what?

236
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:24,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in this issue.

237
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:28,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go up to the council meeting when this appears for the third reading,

238
00:17:28,663 --> 00:17:29,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to speak on it.

239
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:38,506
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if we waive the reading, we're doing away with all the processes that are set up for a good government, in my opinion.

240
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:48,250
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask, Mr. President, respectfully ask, because I don't think my colleague's intent is to do away with the public process or do away with public meetings.

241
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:54,632
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, the three-reading process is state statute, and it's there for a reason.

242
00:17:55,583 --> 00:18:00,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know in the past it's been used, and not often, but it's been used to expedite the process.

243
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:07,173
[SPEAKER_03]: But in my opinion, any time there's a change in city ordinance, we don't want to expedite the process.

244
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:14,278
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure everyone has the equal opportunity and ample opportunity to be heard before this council.

245
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:22,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would respectfully ask my council colleague to withdraw the request to waive the readings, Mr. President.

246
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:32,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I certainly can understand where Councilor Marksley is coming from.

247
00:18:32,938 --> 00:18:36,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we're talking about reorganizing the wheel here.

248
00:18:36,641 --> 00:18:38,883
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just moving a couple positions around in the mayor's office.

249
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:45,729
[SPEAKER_05]: But if he feels as though it's going to be an impediment to open and transparent government, Mr. President, I'm not going to stand in the way of that and I'll be happy to withdraw my motion.

250
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,873
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first reading stands.

251
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:59,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And that item was on the change in terms for the city solicitor.

252
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,840
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-021 is before us now.

253
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:09,745
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the piece dealing with the creation of the chief of staff and policy position.

254
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:11,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, it appears that the

255
00:19:13,032 --> 00:19:17,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Budget Director and Procurement Officer has given us a brief update as to what's going on with the position.

256
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions have been answered.

257
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:19,135
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd move for approval.

258
00:19:19,335 --> 00:19:23,617
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for approval, Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

259
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:24,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

260
00:19:25,017 --> 00:19:34,501
[SPEAKER_10]: I would just go on record and request that the Mayor relook at the salary of this position and just do some research with regards to surrounding communities.

261
00:19:34,562 --> 00:19:42,065
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, Malden is $24,000 less than what the Chief of Staff will be making in Medford.

262
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:49,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to request that she look into that before the second reading.

263
00:19:50,792 --> 00:20:00,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Let the record show that the Vice President kindly requests Her Honor the Mayor to reassess the salary level of this position.

264
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,421
[SPEAKER_07]: At this time, we have a citizen at the podium.

265
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:06,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

266
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:07,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.

267
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:08,504
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Robert Penter.

268
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:10,205
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

269
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:31,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Last week we had a conversation regarding these, this position and the issue as it relates to, um, since we're talking about the chief of staff position right now, um, the concern that a chief of staff would have, especially as it relates to the working operation, not only of the mayor's office, but the interaction of all department heads and employees here in the city of Medford and outside concerns.

270
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:38,232
[SPEAKER_11]: What bothers me on this particular matter right now is that this position, which became effective on January 4th of this year,

271
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:50,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, since it's a title to position and it's a compensated position in a, in a CAF, um, category, um, you're approving it now tonight, but it's been operative, uh, since January 4th of this year.

272
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:57,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, last week, um, I brought up the issue and I don't see any, unless you guys and ladies have a paper on your agenda here.

273
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:05,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the relative to the fact that our city auditor has been asked to also, um, entertain doing the duties of the treasurer collector.

274
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:11,490
[SPEAKER_11]: And from last week to this week, I've consulted with the division of local services and the department of revenue.

275
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,411
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's absolutely, you cannot do it.

276
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:15,852
[SPEAKER_11]: The city auditor cannot do it.

277
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:19,893
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a, it's a prerogative and it's a concern of chief.

278
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:21,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's the chief of staff.

279
00:21:21,294 --> 00:21:23,795
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an issue that a chief of staff would look into.

280
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:26,836
[SPEAKER_11]: With due respect to the chair.

281
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:33,639
[SPEAKER_11]: With due respect, Mr. President, the chief of staff is an advisor, is an advisor to the mayor of this community.

282
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:42,254
[SPEAKER_11]: And the advice to the mayor of the community over and beyond legal advice would be whether this is an allowable or whether it's allowable or not.

283
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:47,736
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no case law and there is no state statute that allows whether it be temporary or what have you.

284
00:21:48,297 --> 00:21:59,562
[SPEAKER_11]: And as a result of that, I think it's something that needs to be addressed because the chief of staff who's been operating since January 4th of this year, it's obvious that that information either has been given to the incumbent mayor.

285
00:22:00,204 --> 00:22:04,327
[SPEAKER_11]: or the president administration just refuses to, um, abide by it.

286
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:20,537
[SPEAKER_11]: The law is also quite succinct in its, um, in its review that under chapter 41, section 52, all accounts are rendered to be kept in the departments of any city shall be subject to the inspection of the city auditor or officer having similar duties.

287
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:26,401
[SPEAKER_11]: So we know now on the chapter 41, section 52, that that's the auditor's position as it relates to

288
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:31,005
[SPEAKER_11]: not being allowed to do any other position in the department, I mean, in the city.

289
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:44,134
[SPEAKER_11]: And chapter 41, section 55 clearly delineates the fact that the town accountant shall be sworn to the faithful performance of his duties, shall hold no other town office involving the receipt or disbursement of monies.

290
00:22:44,755 --> 00:22:53,181
[SPEAKER_11]: If you've already had a chief of staff since January 5th of this year, that is a known fact that should not be allowed to take place, temporary or otherwise.

291
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:54,822
[SPEAKER_11]: There is nothing in state law.

292
00:22:54,862 --> 00:22:56,063
[SPEAKER_11]: There is no state statute.

293
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:58,660
[SPEAKER_11]: and there is no case law that allows this to happen.

294
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,881
[SPEAKER_11]: The only exemption to the rule is- We have before us- Pardon me?

295
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:03,802
[SPEAKER_11]: We have before us, sir- We're talking about the chief of staff.

296
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:04,822
[SPEAKER_11]: The chief of staff position.

297
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,563
[SPEAKER_07]: We have before us the issue of chief of staff.

298
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:09,364
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the duties that a chief of staff does, Mr. President.

299
00:23:09,384 --> 00:23:10,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

300
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:15,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd feel much more comfortable getting legal advice from the city solicitor, Mr. President.

301
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:16,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

302
00:23:18,368 --> 00:23:25,511
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the city solicitor was here last week, and in our conversation he did acknowledge the fact that there is no case law, number one, and there is no

303
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:28,465
[SPEAKER_11]: state statute that allows it for temporary or otherwise.

304
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:29,925
[SPEAKER_11]: He's here tonight.

305
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:33,808
[SPEAKER_11]: He can stand on his own two feet to say it, but I think the OR is quite succinct.

306
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:37,350
[SPEAKER_11]: But more importantly, it's the position of the chief of staff, and they should know this.

307
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:43,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And this new administration should not be going into a territory knowing that it's in violation of state statute.

308
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:52,419
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the unfortunate part about this whole issue right now is that you have a city solicitor that represents the mayor, that represents the city council, that represents the board of appeals.

309
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:54,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And if there's a difference of opinion as to

310
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:56,614
[SPEAKER_11]: who should prevail.

311
00:23:57,014 --> 00:24:01,715
[SPEAKER_11]: It's quite obvious if the council needs to have a question answered, you still haven't gotten that answered.

312
00:24:01,755 --> 00:24:06,036
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you are entitled to have that answer legally, right, wrong, or indifferent.

313
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,737
[SPEAKER_11]: I stand here, and I'll be willing to be corrected.

314
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:16,539
[SPEAKER_11]: But for my information that I've been able to ascertain, and now speaking with the Division of Local Services at the Department of Revenue, you cannot do it.

315
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:17,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And the law is quite succinct on that.

316
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:22,351
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a prerogative, and that's a detailed description that a chief of staff does.

317
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:23,932
[SPEAKER_11]: They are the advisor.

318
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:25,394
[SPEAKER_11]: They are the advisor.

319
00:24:25,454 --> 00:24:32,361
[SPEAKER_11]: And if their advice to the present administration was not consulted with the city's law department, well, that's a mistake there.

320
00:24:32,842 --> 00:24:35,605
[SPEAKER_11]: But if the law department is basically saying this— Point of information, Councilor Knight.

321
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:40,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Until this paper makes its way through three readings, we have no position that's the chief of staff.

322
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,861
[SPEAKER_05]: So until we create the position, we have no position.

323
00:24:43,061 --> 00:24:45,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm a little confused as to the circular logic.

324
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:49,246
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a chief of staff that's in the job, but we don't have the position that's created.

325
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:53,330
[SPEAKER_05]: But if the person was in the position, then the person in the position should be looking at the auditor.

326
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:56,593
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little confused as to where this is going, Mr. President.

327
00:24:56,633 --> 00:25:02,558
[SPEAKER_05]: The matter that's before us is whether or not we want to allow the administration the opportunity to change the audits and create a chief of staff's position.

328
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:11,534
[SPEAKER_05]: And looking at the matter that's before us, it's a reform that the administration is putting forward, a reform that they think that they need to be successful in order to accomplish their goals and objectives.

329
00:25:11,874 --> 00:25:13,776
[SPEAKER_05]: I see no reason to stand in the way of it, Mr. President.

330
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:16,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's time that we move forward, and I move for approval on the paper.

331
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:16,438
[SPEAKER_05]: The President.

332
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,259
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

333
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, no one is standing here to interrupt the appointment.

334
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:25,845
[SPEAKER_11]: The fact of the matter is that that person has been in the position since January 4th of this year.

335
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:30,189
[SPEAKER_11]: So all you're doing is finalizing something that was initiated on January 4th.

336
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:31,550
[SPEAKER_11]: The person is in there.

337
00:25:32,048 --> 00:25:33,308
[SPEAKER_11]: The papers have already gone out.

338
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,189
[SPEAKER_11]: The individual is signing off as chief of staff.

339
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:37,610
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's already a done deal, so to speak.

340
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,672
[SPEAKER_11]: And this council deserves to have, within its own bailiwick of information, the fact whether this is right or wrong.

341
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:57,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if this council is just going to sit there, it would ignore the fact that a city auditor is also assuming the position as a treasurer collector, when you know that there was a young lady, Judy Johnson, who's worked very hard, very capable to be that person, to do it.

342
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:58,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Why is that not happening?

343
00:25:59,737 --> 00:25:59,857
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

344
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:01,840
[SPEAKER_11]: The ball's in your court.

345
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,960
[SPEAKER_11]: You folks can do what you want.

346
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:21,054
[SPEAKER_11]: But this isn't a good message sending out to the people of this community, that you have a present administration that's potentially working with the conflict of interest and in violation of the law by having one person, the city auditor, assume two positions, that and that of the treasurer-collector, when you have a qualified person downstairs in that office that could do the job.

347
00:26:21,354 --> 00:26:22,115
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

348
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:25,317
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'd like to ask you, Mr. President, is the city council going to request

349
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,970
[SPEAKER_11]: a legal opinion on that because I think it's important.

350
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:41,773
[SPEAKER_11]: As a citizen, I'd like to ask one of my colleagues to make that request to the city administration, whether Mrs. Baker on the chapter 41, chapter 41, section 55 is entitled to be the city and the town treasurer at the same time.

351
00:26:43,874 --> 00:26:44,754
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

352
00:26:44,814 --> 00:26:49,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the appropriate time to bring that matter up would be in the public participation portion of our agenda and not right now.

353
00:26:49,295 --> 00:26:50,515
[SPEAKER_05]: We're dealing with the paper that's before us.

354
00:26:51,073 --> 00:26:51,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

355
00:26:52,054 --> 00:26:54,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleague, he knows.

356
00:26:54,976 --> 00:26:57,198
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows that anyone at any time can ask him.

357
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:58,759
[SPEAKER_06]: I am asking a question, Mr. President.

358
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:00,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir, you're no longer a colleague.

359
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Pardon me?

360
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You're no longer a colleague, sir.

361
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:03,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you don't have to address me like that, Mr. President.

362
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:05,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

363
00:27:06,145 --> 00:27:10,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we had asked that question last week, so I would like to put that question forward.

364
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,009
[SPEAKER_10]: The question is?

365
00:27:12,229 --> 00:27:18,914
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any conflict of interest for the auditor to also be running the Treasurer-Collector's office?

366
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:25,224
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a conflict?

367
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:27,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it stated there was a conflict last week.

368
00:27:27,704 --> 00:27:29,465
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd like a legal opinion on that.

369
00:27:29,745 --> 00:27:30,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

370
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:32,826
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought we asked it last week, so.

371
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,347
[SPEAKER_04]: You tabled all the papers.

372
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:37,508
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could ask it this week.

373
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:43,590
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

374
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:44,650
[SPEAKER_11]: You can take a roll call vote.

375
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,871
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you can take a vote on it or what?

376
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'll take a vote on it.

377
00:27:47,391 --> 00:27:47,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

378
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:49,252
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a citizen who wishes to speak.

379
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:57,113
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been added as an amendment to the motion of approval by Councilor Knight.

380
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:01,994
[SPEAKER_10]: 41 section 55.

381
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:08,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of clarification Councilor Caraviello.

382
00:28:09,216 --> 00:28:12,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Is 16-032 is only for the chief of staff correct?

383
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:13,237
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

384
00:28:13,557 --> 00:28:17,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the that's a the budget director I mean the budget I mean the

385
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:19,864
[SPEAKER_02]: The auditor and the... That was never before us.

386
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:20,744
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not before us, right.

387
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:21,825
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Nor was it ever.

388
00:28:21,885 --> 00:28:23,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Our only question tonight is Chief of Staff.

389
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:24,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

390
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:24,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

391
00:28:25,107 --> 00:28:25,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Consul.

392
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:27,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, citizen.

393
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:30,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

394
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

395
00:28:31,912 --> 00:28:32,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

396
00:28:32,553 --> 00:28:32,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

397
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:34,174
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martington, Cumming Street.

398
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually don't have a comment.

399
00:28:35,435 --> 00:28:36,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question.

400
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:37,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's news for you guys.

401
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:40,178
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have a comment.

402
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,443
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, is the Chief of Staff going to be the liaison between the Mayor's office and this body?

403
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:48,632
[SPEAKER_01]: or is that going to be somebody else?

404
00:28:48,692 --> 00:28:55,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And if so, who was, uh, I think it's going to be some, somebody else.

405
00:28:55,977 --> 00:28:56,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

406
00:28:56,397 --> 00:28:57,118
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I wanted to know.

407
00:28:57,198 --> 00:28:57,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

408
00:28:57,638 --> 00:28:58,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, ma'am.

409
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:05,704
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll council caveo.

410
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:08,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

414

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

415
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Price for the long term.

416
00:29:15,951 --> 00:29:16,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

417
00:29:16,652 --> 00:29:17,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Council marks.

418
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:18,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

419
00:29:18,293 --> 00:29:19,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

420
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:19,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

421
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:21,014
[SPEAKER_04]: President Dello Russo?

422
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:21,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

423
00:29:22,954 --> 00:29:25,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

424
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:33,997
[SPEAKER_07]: First reading passes.

425
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:34,317
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-022.

426
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:45,200
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the piece before us for the amendment of ordinances for the procurement officer.

427
00:29:46,358 --> 00:29:54,144

[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

475
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,061
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-034 offered by Councilor Falco.

476
00:31:47,201 --> 00:31:47,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved.

477
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:58,659
[SPEAKER_07]: that the Council President establish an ad hoc subcommittee to study the reuse of the Malden Hospital development and the potential impacts on the surrounding North Medford neighborhoods.

478
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco, let me find you first.

479
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:01,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Here you are.

480
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:02,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

481
00:32:03,101 --> 00:32:04,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

482
00:32:05,603 --> 00:32:18,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past few weeks, actually the past month or so, I've received a number of phone calls, and I think a number of us may have as well, from residents in the North Medford neighborhoods about the proposed development of the old Malden Hospital site.

483
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:25,518
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of situations, I guess, where it could be used as a dense housing development.

484
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:33,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also an idea out there that it might be used as parkland if the city of Malden decides to purchase that.

485
00:32:34,002 --> 00:32:48,490
[SPEAKER_00]: And although most of the development is in Malden, and we have a limited say as to what can actually go there, the resolution tonight is a proactive attempt to help minimize some of the potential impacts.

486
00:32:49,362 --> 00:32:51,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety is the number one issue in that neighborhood.

487
00:32:52,144 --> 00:33:01,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, many of the streets in the North Manfred area are being used as a cut-through to get to Route 93 or to get to the other side of the Fells Way.

488
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:18,517
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, anyone, if a dense housing development does go in there, anyone that wants to head west towards Route 93 in the morning is going to be inundating the streets of Murray Hill Road, Fells Ave, Fulton Spring Road, Vista Ave, Fulton Street,

489
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:23,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And things are pretty tight now in those neighborhoods with regard to traffic.

490
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:32,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, and also with, you have, uh, there are many kids in the morning that are, uh, walking, uh, down the street to get to the bus.

491
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:46,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people are walking to the T. So it's really a major concern, um, that, uh, there's, there's just a major potential impacts there, uh, with regard to traffic and safety that I think really need to be looked at.

492
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:48,515
[SPEAKER_00]: The resolution tonight is a, um,

493
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:51,878
[SPEAKER_00]: proactive attempt to safeguard the North Medford neighborhoods.

494
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:59,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ask you tonight, if you could please assign an ad hoc committee to, uh, to, to work on this, um, and move approval.

495
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:00,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

496
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:02,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you on the motion of approval by council Falco.

497
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:05,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, once we take a vote, I'll be delighted.

498
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:05,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

499
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes councilor Caraviello.

500
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:08,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

501
00:34:09,654 --> 00:34:15,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Upon seeing this on the agenda last week, Mr. President, um, I reached out to a couple of colleagues over in Malden,

502
00:34:16,508 --> 00:34:23,772
[SPEAKER_02]: to find out what was happening on their end, and I also reached out to Alan McDonald from Hallmark Health for their thing.

503
00:34:24,452 --> 00:34:41,121
[SPEAKER_02]: According to my colleague in Malden, they had a meeting a couple weeks ago with the Pine Hills people again, and I guess they've scaled back the project again a little bit, but there's no plan as of now going forward with this.

504
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I spoke to Mr. McDonald this morning, he reiterated the same thing,

505
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:54,600
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, you know, other than, you know, some minor talks going on, there was nothing in the pipeline to get this off the ground.

506
00:34:55,801 --> 00:35:03,522
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and when I talked to them, all the people said they'd be more than happy to come down here, you know, if they did have any further information.

507
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:06,722
[SPEAKER_02]: But as of now, there is nothing happening in there.

508
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:15,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than Pine Hills has an agreement to purchase the property from Hallmark in the event they're able to reach an agreement

509
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:19,537
[SPEAKER_02]: with Medford, Malden, and obtain the necessary permits.

510
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:22,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

511
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Powell.

512
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:42,935
[SPEAKER_16]: As we move on talking about this, I appreciate Councilor Falco bringing this up, but if we can, too, as we look into the development, can we get an update, too, on the New England Memorial site and Stoneham, just as we tie, I take both

513
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,232
[SPEAKER_16]: get more information, especially for myself.

514
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:50,075
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd really like to look into that as well.

515
00:35:50,135 --> 00:35:53,157
[SPEAKER_16]: So if we have any information on that, that'd be helpful.

516
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:53,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

517
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:55,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Send that request up to the OCD director.

518
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:56,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

519
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:56,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

520
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:07,569
[SPEAKER_07]: So as amended by council Scarpelli, that the, uh, uh, office of community development update the, uh, uh, council on the proceedings for the, uh, former new England sand site.

521
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, vice president logo.

522
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:11,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

523
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:12,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, president Dello Russo.

524
00:36:12,373 --> 00:36:12,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I,

525
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this forward.

526
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:43,039
[SPEAKER_10]: We have discussed this a few different times in the council, and I think along with the city council playing an active role, I just really want to maybe amend to also ask the current mayor, our new mayor, to be involved with the process, to be involved with working with Malden, having a good relationship, obviously, and good communication with the mayor of Malden with regards to this site

527
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:54,420
[SPEAKER_10]: We may only have three acres, I believe, which is like 10%, 15% of the entire project, but we will bear probably 50 to 90% of the traffic burden.

528
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is just extremely important for our department heads and our administration to be in contact with the city of Malden.

529
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:07,344
[SPEAKER_10]: We can voice our opinions and do what we can, but I think that is extremely important.

530
00:37:07,444 --> 00:37:10,505
[SPEAKER_10]: When I attended one of the first meetings at

531
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:18,810
[SPEAKER_10]: The BB school, I think it was, in Malden, there was probably 100 residents, and every elected official from Malden was there.

532
00:37:18,851 --> 00:37:21,433
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe I might have been the only city councilor.

533
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:24,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was department heads from Malden.

534
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:28,761
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe our OCD Lorenzo was our only department head there.

535
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:34,927
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do need to make our faces known, and we need our administration to get on board and get involved.

536
00:37:36,095 --> 00:37:44,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to just bring up, we definitely, this, our ad hoc committee and the council as a whole, we've supported, there is a community group out there that's working hard.

537
00:37:44,657 --> 00:37:53,139
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a, they've done plans, they've had engineers work on low or density projects, which is, I believe would be our push.

538
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:56,559
[SPEAKER_10]: As low density as possible with green space.

539
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:58,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, obviously we're not Malden.

540
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Malden may want their best bang for their buck.

541
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure exactly where they're leaning, but we want to lean for lower density

542
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:11,354
[SPEAKER_10]: lower traffic, less amount of cars, so that it doesn't impact our neighborhoods.

543
00:38:11,534 --> 00:38:21,779
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to come down, like you said, Murray Hill Road and a number, you know, come right onto all of our roads up in the Heights are going to be congested, even more so than they are now.

544
00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:28,683
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know that committee, I did have been conversing with them and they have, they're working on a traffic plan.

545
00:38:28,743 --> 00:38:33,345
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully this ad hoc committee can get involved with them as well and work together.

546
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:44,597
[SPEAKER_10]: with the Traffic Commission to create a plan, whether it's certain directions, not being able to come on certain ways on our roads.

547
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:55,640
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to think ahead of the game, and I think that's something that this committee will help out with a great deal so that we can look at the big picture, a big map, and how it's going to affect traffic.

548
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Air pollution, there's a number of other concerns as well, but traffic is the number one concern that I keep hearing about.

549
00:39:01,491 --> 00:39:03,912
[SPEAKER_10]: from our residents and from the community group.

550
00:39:03,952 --> 00:39:08,472
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really hope we can get some work done on this.

551
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:17,074
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope the administration gets on board to get involved for the sake of Medford in its entirety, but the Fulton Heights.

552
00:39:17,574 --> 00:39:17,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

553
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:22,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So as amended by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

554
00:39:22,755 --> 00:39:23,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

555
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:30,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree with Councilor Longo's comments that the city administration has to take a more active role on this particular project

556
00:39:30,978 --> 00:39:44,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Although Medford only has a small footprint in the overall project itself, there should be ample public notification for residents, particular abutters that are impacted by this.

557
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,584
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know the traffic was going to be an issue.

558
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:56,629
[SPEAKER_03]: This council has gone on record for the past, I believe it's four or five years now, asking that the cut-through road in the back that leads up to Murray Hill Road be closed.

559
00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:00,070
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had the chief of police here, I believe it was about a year, year and a half ago,

560
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:04,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said he will never let that particular road be opened.

561
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:16,668
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a shortcut to 93 and be a terrible impact on the neighborhood, Grover and Murray Hill Road and Fry and that whole particular area up there, Mr. President.

562
00:40:16,688 --> 00:40:30,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm happy to see that we did take a step on assuring residents that that cut-through road will not be reopened again like it was years ago, and that the buffer between the project and the homes be maintained.

563
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:42,652
[SPEAKER_03]: because part of the project called for some of the shrubbery and wooded area, which acts as a buffer between the project and the neighborhood, be removed, Mr. President.

564
00:40:43,252 --> 00:40:49,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a large issue of contention with neighbors and the project itself.

565
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:53,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank Councilor Falco for bringing this up.

566
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:56,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I think an ad hoc committee, any time we put together

567
00:40:57,248 --> 00:41:01,970
[SPEAKER_03]: at least some oversight on behalf of this community is a good idea, so I would support this.

568
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:03,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

569
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

570
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:08,872
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of approval by Councilor Falco, I second.

571
00:41:09,872 --> 00:41:19,716
[SPEAKER_07]: A roll call vote has been requested on this motion that was amended by Councilors Scarpelli and Lungo-Koehn.

572
00:41:20,036 --> 00:41:21,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

573
00:41:23,057 --> 00:41:23,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello?

574
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:24,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

575
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:25,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco?

576
00:41:25,618 --> 00:41:25,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

577
00:41:26,158 --> 00:41:26,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

578
00:41:26,758 --> 00:41:26,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

579
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:28,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-President Lowell-Kern.

580
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:28,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

581
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:29,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks.

582
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:29,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

583
00:41:30,598 --> 00:41:31,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

584
00:41:31,278 --> 00:41:31,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

585
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:33,040
[SPEAKER_07]: President Dello Russo.

586
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

587
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,102
[SPEAKER_07]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative, the motion passes.

588
00:41:36,483 --> 00:41:43,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

589
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:44,610
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-035 offered by Councilor Knight.

590
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:55,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas the current ordinance entitled to chapter 90, vehicles for hire enables the city council with powers more appropriately vested in the executive branch, be it so ordered,

591
00:41:56,161 --> 00:42:09,330
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford City Council amend the Medford Mass Code of Ordinances entitled Chapter 9D, Vehicles for Hire, by striking the words City Council and replacing them with Traffic Commission in the following subsections.

592
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:10,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Section 9032, section 9033, 9034, 9037, 9039, 9040, 9045, 9048, 9051,

593
00:42:25,216 --> 00:42:30,580
[SPEAKER_07]: 9-0-5-2, 9-0-6-7, and 9-0-6-8.

594
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:33,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

595
00:42:34,283 --> 00:42:35,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

596
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:38,147
[SPEAKER_05]: This resolution is rather self-explanatory.

597
00:42:38,707 --> 00:42:41,530
[SPEAKER_05]: I bring it forward relative to Article 2 in taxicabs.

598
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:49,717
[SPEAKER_05]: The City Council currently has the power and authority vested in it through the Code of Massachusetts Ordinances to license taxicabs, taxicab operators.

599
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:50,738
[SPEAKER_05]: What this

600
00:42:51,996 --> 00:42:55,858
[SPEAKER_05]: resolution would do would transfer that authority to the Traffic Commission, Mr. President.

601
00:42:56,618 --> 00:43:04,921
[SPEAKER_05]: As a member of the Subcommittee on Licensing, we met and we performed an audit of the operators in the community here in Medford, and a number of them were not in compliance.

602
00:43:05,802 --> 00:43:12,024
[SPEAKER_05]: But as the legislative branch of government here, I think that it's a slippery slope for us to get so involved in regulatory affairs.

603
00:43:12,084 --> 00:43:18,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that's a function that's really more relegated and more appropriately vested within the executive, Mr. President.

604
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:24,065
[SPEAKER_05]: So I bring forward this paper to reform the way that we do business relative to the issuance of taxi cab licenses.

605
00:43:25,206 --> 00:43:33,234
[SPEAKER_05]: In my two years on the council, we've had Councilor Marks abstain from voting relative to the fact that we have an ordinance that doesn't make much sense.

606
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:38,920
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a number of people come before this council seeking an opportunity to drive taxi.

607
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:58,791
[SPEAKER_05]: But our ordinance is all over the place, Mr. President, so I think it would make sense for us to step away from the regulatory affairs and take a look really at the language and actually legislating an ordinance that makes sense, but allowing the Traffic Commission the opportunity and the power to oversee the issuance, revocation, suspension, so on and so forth of taxi licenses here in the community.

608
00:43:59,371 --> 00:44:03,413
[SPEAKER_05]: As such, I'd ask my colleagues to join me in voting in the affirmative.

609
00:44:03,513 --> 00:44:08,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, this is a change in ordinance, and whereas it is so,

610
00:44:09,505 --> 00:44:13,747
[SPEAKER_07]: should it not be subjected to three votes and public vetting?

611
00:44:14,308 --> 00:44:14,808
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe so.

612
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:16,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

613
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:21,431
[SPEAKER_07]: So this vote would constitute a first reading of such change.

614
00:44:23,172 --> 00:44:24,713
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a motion for approval.

615
00:44:25,573 --> 00:44:27,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

616
00:44:28,255 --> 00:44:28,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

617
00:44:29,215 --> 00:44:31,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank my fellow councilor for doing this.

618
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:36,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the other cities, the police department is the issuing authority.

619
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:40,950
[SPEAKER_02]: for the taxi cab licenses, and I think it does belong with them.

620
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is something that's been long overdue.

621
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:47,433
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say I wholeheartedly support it.

622
00:44:49,334 --> 00:44:50,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

623
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:53,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks, my apologies.

624
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:54,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

625
00:44:54,837 --> 00:45:03,502
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a worthy suggestion, although I would ask my council colleague, maybe if we could send it to the licensing subcommittee and have it originate from the licensing subcommittee.

626
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:07,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would hold a little more weight coming through that angle.

627
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:17,417
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I would also ask that, uh, although the request now says the traffic commission, council Kaviello just said he likes it with the police department.

628
00:45:17,738 --> 00:45:23,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two separate entities, traffic commission and the police department, the two separate entities.

629
00:45:23,322 --> 00:45:27,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you like what the police department, you don't like this because this is sending it to the traffic commission.

630
00:45:28,506 --> 00:45:30,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now I'm not aware of any licenses.

631
00:45:31,309 --> 00:45:33,090
[SPEAKER_03]: The traffic commission is responsible for.

632
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:38,134
[SPEAKER_03]: They are responsible for signage, street markings and other important issues in the community.

633
00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:44,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but, um, this would be a difference in what they are currently responsible for.

634
00:45:44,858 --> 00:45:52,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying I'm opposed to it, but I think maybe if it's before the subcommittee on licensing, uh, we can come up with a better option.

635
00:45:53,402 --> 00:46:01,227
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would probably tend to agree that the police department would be probably the best option where we already have someone that's in what we refer to the hackney division.

636
00:46:02,417 --> 00:46:11,302
[SPEAKER_03]: that's responsible to make sure these cars are properly registered, make sure these cars adhere to city ordinances and codes and so forth.

637
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:20,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just respectfully ask my colleague if we could send it to the licensing subcommittee, maybe hash out some of these questions and then move it forward.

638
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:22,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a very worthy suggestion.

639
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:25,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello?

640
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:33,569
[SPEAKER_05]: The paper was filed, Mr. President, to start a discussion, to start a discussion on making a reform that's going to work best for the city.

641
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:35,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly have no problem with that whatsoever.

642
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:40,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So you withdraw your motion for approval and ask that it be sent to the committee on?

643
00:46:40,775 --> 00:46:41,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Licensing.

644
00:46:41,556 --> 00:46:42,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Licensing.

645
00:46:42,696 --> 00:46:48,801
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, as seconded by Councilor Marks, that this matter be sent to the Licensing Commission.

646
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:51,043
[SPEAKER_07]: And we invite the citizen to speak.

647
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:52,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

648
00:46:52,805 --> 00:46:53,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

649
00:46:56,269 --> 00:46:56,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi there.

650
00:46:57,490 --> 00:46:59,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

651
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:04,513
[SPEAKER_12]: And so as somebody, I'm here wearing two hats.

652
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:11,556
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here as a citizen and also as the chair of the Medford Disability Commission.

653
00:47:13,637 --> 00:47:20,140
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really, it may not seem immediately relevant, but the licensing of

654
00:47:21,557 --> 00:47:28,701
[SPEAKER_12]: Taxis is actually extremely important to folks who might experience ADA violations and civil rights violations.

655
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:48,913
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always really important for me, as a service dog handler, to know who licenses the taxis and be sure that they are aware of the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act, portions of the ADA that do apply to taxi service, because I have been kicked out of a lot of taxis, and it wasn't because I was drunk and rowdy.

656
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:56,191
[SPEAKER_12]: It was because I was using a service dog.

657
00:47:56,971 --> 00:48:02,472
[SPEAKER_12]: My friends who use service dogs can report very similar situations.

658
00:48:02,552 --> 00:48:04,893
[SPEAKER_12]: And unfortunately, it is no better with Uber or Lyft.

659
00:48:06,213 --> 00:48:16,475
[SPEAKER_12]: But the thing about taxis, and the reason why I take them now, is because unlike Uber or Lyft, I can go to the folks who licensed them and say, my civil rights have been violated.

660
00:48:16,975 --> 00:48:17,535
[SPEAKER_12]: What can you do?

661
00:48:19,236 --> 00:48:32,328
[SPEAKER_12]: So wherever it is that this lands, I'd like to be sure that whomever may be licensing this is really clear on what the AD obligations are of licensed taxi drivers.

662
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:40,455
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe looks also at looking at whether there can be some actual accessible cabs in this city, because there are none.

663
00:48:43,033 --> 00:48:46,894
[SPEAKER_12]: would possibly be willing to work with the Disability Commission on such things.

664
00:48:47,554 --> 00:48:58,078
[SPEAKER_12]: In my other life, well, I volunteer to provide training at the Cambridge Taxi School.

665
00:48:58,418 --> 00:49:00,859
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, this is not Cambridge, and our system is very, very different.

666
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:10,982
[SPEAKER_12]: But as it happens, licensed taxi drivers in Cambridge, in order to receive that license, must go through training, a week of training, and pass a written exam.

667
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:20,548
[SPEAKER_12]: And one portion of that training involves serving customers with disabilities and older adults.

668
00:49:21,409 --> 00:49:27,615
[SPEAKER_12]: And I provide part of the training on serving customers with disabilities, particularly the rights of people with service animals.

669
00:49:28,076 --> 00:49:30,118
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm happy to help out with anything I can do.

670
00:49:30,878 --> 00:49:48,984
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, to make sure that when we are, I have no problem with, you know, moving it to an appropriate area, but I'd like to make sure that it's done thoughtfully and in a way that preserves, um, the civil rights of people who would be using taxis and maybe puts a little teeth into things because

671
00:49:50,031 --> 00:50:07,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, it's really hard to, right now, basically, if I have a problem with a cab, I call Diane, and she, I don't want to put more on her plate, but I call Diane, and she talks to the cops, and eventually, it gets around to, it would be great to have, okay, these are the folks who handle this.

672
00:50:08,142 --> 00:50:09,763
[SPEAKER_12]: They are also in charge of the licenses.

673
00:50:10,004 --> 00:50:10,924
[SPEAKER_12]: There are teeth in this.

674
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:12,605
[SPEAKER_12]: There are consequences if you violate the law.

675
00:50:13,166 --> 00:50:13,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

676
00:50:14,546 --> 00:50:15,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, ma'am.

677
00:50:15,707 --> 00:50:16,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, can I just ask a question?

678
00:50:17,508 --> 00:50:18,729
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could, yes, Councilor.

679
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:26,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you been denied access with your service dog with Medford cabs?

680
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:34,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to be honest and say I don't use a lot of Medford cabs because I've had some sketchy dealings.

681
00:50:34,803 --> 00:50:39,886
[SPEAKER_12]: So there was one Medford cab that lied about how much he charged because he knew I couldn't see the meter.

682
00:50:41,026 --> 00:50:47,169
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've had another situation where I took the cab from Medford to Cambridge and he charged me $50.

683
00:50:48,434 --> 00:50:52,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So I haven't, I gotta be honest, I've been using green and yellow cab.

684
00:50:52,696 --> 00:50:56,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And just one other question too.

685
00:50:56,937 --> 00:51:00,598
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned that Cambridge requires testing of their cab drivers?

686
00:51:01,018 --> 00:51:03,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, they have a very different system there.

687
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,980
[SPEAKER_12]: There are no formal cab companies in Cambridge.

688
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,021
[SPEAKER_12]: They are all radio subscription services.

689
00:51:09,521 --> 00:51:15,764
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, and also obviously they have a much bigger system and there's like actual, you know, money in their city and stuff like that.

690
00:51:17,055 --> 00:51:35,885
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, in order to be licensed as a cab driver, they provide, well, in general, for the past 20 years or so, they have provided training once a month for folks who are interested in getting the license to drive a cab.

691
00:51:36,465 --> 00:51:39,526
[SPEAKER_12]: Of late, it has been less frequent.

692
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:45,069
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's scheduled for every month, but a lot of them get canceled because, frankly, it's easier to drive for Uber or Lyft.

693
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:46,390
[SPEAKER_12]: You don't have to go through the whole process.

694
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:49,981
[SPEAKER_12]: so there aren't as many people signing up for the classes.

695
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:57,485
[SPEAKER_12]: But you cannot drive a taxi in Cambridge unless you have been through their system, through their training and passed their test.

696
00:51:58,466 --> 00:51:58,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

697
00:51:59,266 --> 00:52:00,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

698
00:52:00,267 --> 00:52:16,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, if we just could, maybe where the licenses are issued by, they're approved by the council, but issued by the city clerk, that we can send out a letter or contact these drivers to let them know that they are required to take

699
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:21,671
[SPEAKER_03]: residents that have a service dog, and I assume that's state statute, Mr. Clerk, is that correct?

700
00:52:22,331 --> 00:52:23,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Federal statute?

701
00:52:23,732 --> 00:52:23,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

702
00:52:23,872 --> 00:52:25,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's the ADA?

703
00:52:25,834 --> 00:52:26,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

704
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:26,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

705
00:52:27,154 --> 00:52:31,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we send a letter, Mr. Clerk, to let these drivers know?

706
00:52:32,337 --> 00:52:33,818
[SPEAKER_03]: It will be made as such.

707
00:52:34,178 --> 00:52:34,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

708
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the idea of testing.

709
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a great concept that Cambridge uses.

710
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:42,984
[SPEAKER_07]: On our application, there's a test.

711
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:44,885
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been the same question for two years,

712
00:52:45,908 --> 00:52:51,150
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's how do you get from CVS and Medford Square, not specifying which one, to the Medford Police Station.

713
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:52,530
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the test?

714
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:53,471
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the test.

715
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:57,172
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the written exam, yes.

716
00:52:57,252 --> 00:52:57,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

717
00:53:00,073 --> 00:53:03,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is why Councilor Knight wants to look into the issue.

718
00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:05,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

719
00:53:06,115 --> 00:53:07,976
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of them get it wrong, Councilor.

720
00:53:08,876 --> 00:53:10,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

721
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:12,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I do agree with the young lady.

722
00:53:13,138 --> 00:53:14,098
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a need for more

723
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,842
[SPEAKER_02]: handicap accessible vehicles in the city of Medford.

724
00:53:17,322 --> 00:53:20,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if we have any handicapped vehicles in Medford.

725
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:37,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I would encourage, I mean, the vehicle is more costly than the regular cars, but there is a need from the city and I would encourage, I would hope that the taxi company would be encouraged maybe to buy one or two vehicles.

726
00:53:37,377 --> 00:53:38,058
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. President,

727
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:47,183
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could, uh, if you could, uh, call a, uh, subcommittee meeting next Tuesday, uh, so we can be the chair of the subcommittee, which would be myself.

728
00:53:48,203 --> 00:53:50,463
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could have that next Tuesday, we'd be prior to our meeting.

729
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:51,724
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can deal with this matter.

730
00:53:52,184 --> 00:53:58,025
[SPEAKER_07]: You're at will as chair to a convener committee at your, uh, very good.

731
00:53:59,385 --> 00:53:59,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

732
00:53:59,665 --> 00:54:00,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

733
00:54:01,646 --> 00:54:07,707
[SPEAKER_03]: What council Caraviello just mentioned was one of the reasons why we asked the licensing subcommittee to reconvene.

734
00:54:08,355 --> 00:54:14,237
[SPEAKER_03]: and come out with an ordinance that addresses some of the concerns that we're, you know, hearing tonight.

735
00:54:14,658 --> 00:54:26,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them was that we bantered around was that if you had a cab company in the city that had more than, I believe it was three or four cabs, that they were required under city ordinance to provide at least one handicap cab.

736
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:30,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And those were the things that we wanted to build into the ordinance.

737
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:37,927
[SPEAKER_03]: But the licensing subcommittee, for some reason, never met on this, Mr. President, and never addressed some of the concerns.

738
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:49,288
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe now we can eventually move this on and maybe give it to someone more equipped to looking into these issues and presenting these issues, Mr. President.

739
00:54:49,628 --> 00:54:49,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

740
00:54:49,948 --> 00:54:52,249
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion approved by Councilor Knight as amended.

741
00:54:53,609 --> 00:54:54,369
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

742
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:54,609
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

743
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:55,850
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

744
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:01,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to send it to Subcommittee on Licensing Cases.

745
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:03,692
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-036 offered by Vice President Lockwood-Kern.

746
00:55:04,331 --> 00:55:12,256
[SPEAKER_07]: be resolved that the schools and public relations department set up a voicemail, as I have received complaints that no one is answering the phone.

747
00:55:12,597 --> 00:55:15,679
[SPEAKER_07]: There is not an option to leave a message for a return call.

748
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:16,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

749
00:55:16,979 --> 00:55:18,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

750
00:55:18,801 --> 00:55:31,249
[SPEAKER_10]: I put this on the agenda after a third complaint last week, end of last week, with regards to people trying to get in contact with our new schools public relations position.

751
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,291
[SPEAKER_10]: At first, there was no phone number.

752
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:35,492
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there was a phone number.

753
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:42,658
[SPEAKER_10]: To date, I don't believe, as of two days ago, there was still no voicemail set up.

754
00:55:42,958 --> 00:55:46,201
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we're almost mid to end of January.

755
00:55:46,241 --> 00:55:58,070
[SPEAKER_10]: That's two to three weeks going on with no way to get in touch with, besides possibly a new email that's been set up with our public relations professional.

756
00:55:59,872 --> 00:56:01,273
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm surprised, and I'm a little

757
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:10,794
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, obviously not happy about it because this is a position that is creating so much controversy within our city.

758
00:56:11,975 --> 00:56:16,037
[SPEAKER_10]: The morale at the schools, it's not helped morale.

759
00:56:16,778 --> 00:56:21,940
[SPEAKER_10]: So you would expect that, and it's not even necessarily this person's fault.

760
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe this rests with the higher ups.

761
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:28,844
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there should be an office, there should be a voicemail set up.

762
00:56:28,904 --> 00:56:29,925
[SPEAKER_10]: It was, you know, kind of,

763
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:36,562
[SPEAKER_10]: push through at the last hour before January 4th for the change in the administration.

764
00:56:36,582 --> 00:56:40,743
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just feel like there should be a phone, there should be a voicemail, and there should be responsiveness.

765
00:56:41,504 --> 00:56:46,765
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask the superintendent of schools, when will a voicemail be set up?

766
00:56:47,506 --> 00:57:00,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, again, we asked questions a few weeks back with regards to job description, salary, what this position is going to entail, what the person in the position is going to do on a day-to-day basis.

767
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:12,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that's very important, because the fourth complaint I got was with regards to somebody from the PTO asking for a little bit of help on something, and then being shoved, you know, you have to ask the principal first.

768
00:57:12,975 --> 00:57:27,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, and I have discussed this with somebody from another PTO, too, and they're asking me questions about what the public relations is going to help them with, and I really don't have the answers.

769
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,226
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I hope that is part of the job.

770
00:57:31,228 --> 00:57:34,289
[SPEAKER_10]: the public relations professional is going to help.

771
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:45,134
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, all the volunteers, I hope, with regards to the PTO, help with the publications and things that definitely can enhance all of our elementary schools and our high school.

772
00:57:45,694 --> 00:57:48,455
[SPEAKER_10]: But obviously, we haven't got any responses.

773
00:57:48,495 --> 00:57:59,479
[SPEAKER_10]: So I again ask for responses on a job description with regards to this position so that we can better answer our constituents' questions and be able to direct the right people to the right place.

774
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:00,740
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully, this is going to

775
00:58:01,313 --> 00:58:08,599
[SPEAKER_10]: This job should, at I believe $85,000, $90,000, should be helping our schools tremendously.

776
00:58:08,759 --> 00:58:13,303
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't see how that can be happening when there's no voicemail and no ability to respond.

777
00:58:14,464 --> 00:58:19,769
[SPEAKER_10]: One woman said she's called a number of times and is very frustrated.

778
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:23,712
[SPEAKER_10]: She can't even leave a message in a voicemail.

779
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:26,014
[SPEAKER_10]: So the complaints are real.

780
00:58:26,134 --> 00:58:29,357
[SPEAKER_10]: And I felt that it needed to be put on again, especially since

781
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,432
[SPEAKER_10]: We haven't got any answers to our questions.

782
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:36,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think our superintendent took the hit for this in the paper.

783
00:58:36,755 --> 00:58:40,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe he's the one that should be, you know, responsive to us.

784
00:58:40,698 --> 00:58:41,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

785
00:58:41,158 --> 00:58:43,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Felken.

786
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

787
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:48,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I actually did, uh, when I saw this resolution, I, I wanted to get more information.

788
00:58:48,904 --> 00:58:56,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually did reach out to the superintendent and he did tell me that the phone will be, the voicemail will be active by the end of the week.

789
00:58:57,711 --> 00:58:59,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I taught, it seems like, I guess when they move,

790
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:03,370
[SPEAKER_00]: The previous person out and they moved the new person in.

791
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:07,795
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if something happened with the phone jack, but it sounded like there was maybe some sort of technical issue.

792
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:11,058
[SPEAKER_00]: But they should have a voicemail by the end of the week.

793
00:59:12,459 --> 00:59:13,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

794
00:59:14,702 --> 00:59:16,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

795
00:59:16,283 --> 00:59:16,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

796
00:59:16,864 --> 00:59:17,044
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

797
00:59:17,204 --> 00:59:18,085
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Alex Good.

798
00:59:18,105 --> 00:59:21,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the owner of the School of Lumiondo Martial Arts on 412 Salem Street.

799
00:59:23,196 --> 00:59:25,016
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm just basically here to back that.

800
00:59:25,456 --> 00:59:28,057
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been trying to set up an after school program with the Roberts Elementary.

801
00:59:28,257 --> 00:59:32,098
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been in close contact with Cheryl Rodriguez of the PTO.

802
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:38,239
[SPEAKER_09]: She directed me to Lisa Evangelista, who, as you said, I called four or five times, no voicemail.

803
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:39,659
[SPEAKER_09]: I emailed her, no response.

804
00:59:39,799 --> 00:59:41,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I contacted her on LinkedIn, no response.

805
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I finally called Paulette Van der Kloot, school committee member.

806
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:50,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard back from her yet either.

807
00:59:51,961 --> 00:59:54,842
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, uh, councilor Scarpelli.

808
00:59:55,262 --> 01:00:00,903
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate, um, well, has anybody directed you to the principal of the school?

809
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:04,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, Mr. Johnson, he's on board.

810
01:00:04,624 --> 01:00:06,425
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, uh, we were all ready to go with it.

811
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:07,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I made a fire out.

812
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:12,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we had dates set on it and then we went to get it approved and it's just been at standstill.

813
01:00:13,146 --> 01:00:16,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I called at the end of last week,

814
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:18,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Johnson.

815
01:00:18,624 --> 01:00:20,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Johnson direct you to Mr. Vietorista?

816
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:22,765
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I haven't talked to Mr. Johnson since probably December.

817
01:00:23,185 --> 01:00:23,406
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

818
01:00:23,426 --> 01:00:24,226
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's a problem.

819
01:00:24,866 --> 01:00:26,867
[SPEAKER_16]: So the protocol should be, Ms.

820
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:42,373
[SPEAKER_16]: Rodriguez should know this, that the PTG, it goes through the principal that they work with because there are a lot of, there are different, different issues that have to go through before you move, move on that availability for us and see what programs.

821
01:00:42,393 --> 01:00:46,295
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll be glad to meet with you after this and just grab your number and information.

822
01:00:46,795 --> 01:00:56,081
[SPEAKER_16]: and make sure that that goes through because again, this also reverts back to a bigger issue and that's recreation.

823
01:00:56,101 --> 01:01:00,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Have you gone to the subcommittee meetings on recreation and arts and recreation?

824
01:01:00,184 --> 01:01:07,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I think this is important that these are the avenues that community schools and recreation, it's important that we can do that too, just to piggyback that.

825
01:01:07,909 --> 01:01:12,152
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'd like to talk to you at the end if I can, and maybe I can help you with moving that forward.

826
01:01:12,803 --> 01:01:13,143
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

827
01:01:13,223 --> 01:01:21,128
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that in our standing as former school committee members, anything that goes from the PTG or outside agencies has to go through the principal first.

828
01:01:21,656 --> 01:01:24,818
[SPEAKER_16]: And then any other information that goes through has to go to the superintendent's office.

829
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:26,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, we did do that.

830
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:30,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so what happened was we, um, submitted it to the principal.

831
01:01:30,401 --> 01:01:34,583
[SPEAKER_09]: He submitted the flyer to the superintendent and there was never a response.

832
01:01:34,643 --> 01:01:37,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it was mentioned that it wasn't approved.

833
01:01:37,225 --> 01:01:38,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he said it wasn't approved.

834
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:42,548
[SPEAKER_09]: The superintendent, Mr. Bellison said it wasn't approved because he hadn't talked to the principal.

835
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:46,653
[SPEAKER_09]: even though Cheryl talked to the principal first.

836
01:01:46,753 --> 01:01:50,474
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's just, I'm sure it's just a lot of misunderstanding and I just want to get it sorted out.

837
01:01:50,494 --> 01:01:50,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

838
01:01:50,615 --> 01:01:51,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to help you with that.

839
01:01:51,435 --> 01:01:51,735
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

840
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:52,435
[SPEAKER_09]: That was all I had.

841
01:01:52,535 --> 01:01:52,916
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

842
01:01:52,956 --> 01:01:54,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

843
01:01:54,316 --> 01:01:54,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

844
01:01:55,737 --> 01:01:56,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

845
01:01:56,738 --> 01:02:06,282
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is one of the reasons why the school department felt they need a public relations person to not get back to a resident, a business owner.

846
01:02:06,742 --> 01:02:09,644
[SPEAKER_03]: This gentleman's owned a business in the city for a number of years.

847
01:02:10,124 --> 01:02:11,845
[SPEAKER_03]: He was here in the square for a lot of years.

848
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:21,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Now he's on Salem Street, he runs a reputable business, and that sends a lousy message in this community when people don't return phone calls or e-mails, Mr. President.

849
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:28,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're not the right person he should be talking to, then it's a two-second call saying, you know what, you have to talk to this person.

850
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:32,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as Councilor Scarpelli said, circle the wagons and re-talk to the principal.

851
01:02:32,808 --> 01:02:35,910
[SPEAKER_03]: But to not to get back to someone sends an awful message, Mr. President.

852
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:39,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And just let me speak as a parent tonight, if I could.

853
01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:52,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the PR person wants to work on something with the superintendent, it's a nightmare, Mr. President, trying to get out of the Medford High School parking lot on a Friday afternoon, on an early release day on a Wednesday.

854
01:02:53,048 --> 01:02:58,010
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes you a half hour to 45 minutes to get out of the Medford High School parking lot.

855
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:59,350
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unacceptable.

856
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:07,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the case of an emergency, Mr. President, God forbid someone had to get out of there in an emergency, I don't know what would happen, Mr. President.

857
01:03:08,473 --> 01:03:09,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unacceptable.

858
01:03:09,642 --> 01:03:16,966
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the first time, it happens every Friday up there, every early release day, and it's unacceptable that it has to continue that way.

859
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:32,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Last Wednesday, I witnessed kids coming down the hill on the ice, we got a little rain and some ice there, and there wasn't any salt or anything put, and you had to see the kids try to traverse down the hill, which many kids do.

860
01:03:32,835 --> 01:03:36,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unacceptable that the property's not kept after.

861
01:03:37,969 --> 01:03:47,016
[SPEAKER_03]: We all remember years ago what happened in the city of Boston when they didn't shovel sidewalks and kids walked in the street and were struck by a vehicle, Mr. President.

862
01:03:47,516 --> 01:03:48,817
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's unacceptable.

863
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:50,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on with that high school.

864
01:03:50,899 --> 01:04:01,127
[SPEAKER_03]: But let me tell you, they're putting positions up there, they're hiring administrators, and we can't get them to salt and sand for the kids, and we can't get them to move the parking lot cars

865
01:04:01,553 --> 01:04:02,333
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the high school.

866
01:04:02,893 --> 01:04:03,754
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get them out.

867
01:04:04,234 --> 01:04:12,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I would ask anyone of the council here to go up there at 2.15 on a Friday, park in the lot, and see how long it takes you to get out.

868
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:14,877
[SPEAKER_03]: See how long it takes you to get out.

869
01:04:16,077 --> 01:04:18,978
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a major concern, and it shouldn't be happening this way.

870
01:04:19,879 --> 01:04:22,139
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a police officer that's assigned up there.

871
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,060
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an officer that's

872
01:04:24,837 --> 01:04:27,459
[SPEAKER_03]: a high school safety officer that's assigned up there.

873
01:04:27,899 --> 01:04:29,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And he does his best.

874
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,022
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Mosaic has been up there a lot of years, and he does his best.

875
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:38,566
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's one person, and there's hundreds of cars trying to pick up students, buses, and so forth.

876
01:04:38,806 --> 01:04:49,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really is — it's a shame that, as a city our size, that we can't get a handle on how to alleviate the trafficking issues that are going on at the high school.

877
01:04:50,513 --> 01:04:52,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I really — I really have to say that, Mr. President.

878
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:53,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope this gets to

879
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:58,718
[SPEAKER_03]: the superintendent of schools and the school committee, because it's unacceptable.

880
01:04:58,738 --> 01:04:59,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And they should be well aware of this.

881
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:01,379
[SPEAKER_03]: This is nothing new.

882
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:04,200
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been happening for years up there, Mr. President.

883
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:10,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And the students walking down a slippery sidewalk is a concern of mine.

884
01:05:10,362 --> 01:05:13,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be a concern of everyone behind this railing, Mr. President.

885
01:05:14,203 --> 01:05:15,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

886
01:05:15,223 --> 01:05:16,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

887
01:05:17,464 --> 01:05:17,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

888
01:05:18,444 --> 01:05:19,124
[SPEAKER_07]: You're all set?

889
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:21,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion?

890
01:05:28,885 --> 01:05:31,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval.

891
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:40,011
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

892
01:05:40,471 --> 01:05:43,353
[SPEAKER_03]: As amended by Councilor Marks.

893
01:05:43,393 --> 01:05:44,253
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor.

894
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:55,831
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

895
01:05:57,012 --> 01:05:57,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Mark me as opposed.

896
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:02,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

897
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:17,644
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-037, offered by Vice President Langel and Kern, be it resolved that the administration update the council with any changes that will be made regarding customer service between city departments and the public to ensure that there is always a positive interaction between the two.

898
01:06:18,424 --> 01:06:19,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

899
01:06:19,765 --> 01:06:21,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

900
01:06:21,246 --> 01:06:22,727
[SPEAKER_10]: This actually,

901
01:06:23,587 --> 01:06:28,389
[SPEAKER_10]: was on my radar with regards to customer service, treating people with respect.

902
01:06:28,709 --> 01:06:30,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Due to some complaints, I had brought this up to Ms.

903
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Miller at our budget hearings in June.

904
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:41,974
[SPEAKER_10]: She did say she was going to make sure that was brought up with regards to the personnel and staff.

905
01:06:42,774 --> 01:06:44,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And it also came up during the great debate.

906
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:53,018
[SPEAKER_10]: I was pleasantly surprised when our new mayor had this answer during the debate that

907
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:58,962
[SPEAKER_10]: things were going to change and, you know, people were going to be treated all the time with respect.

908
01:06:58,982 --> 01:07:00,103
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't believe it.

909
01:07:00,643 --> 01:07:17,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe me, I'm not saying that there's a problem everywhere, but when you do have a complaint here and there, you just want to make sure the public can come in to whether it's a police station or city hall or, you know, go to any department and get the answers they need, be treated respectfully and be on their way.

910
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:21,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was something that was on my radar in June.

911
01:07:21,191 --> 01:07:22,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It has been in the past.

912
01:07:23,098 --> 01:07:27,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was something that the mayor spoke very well with regards to how that's going to change.

913
01:07:27,822 --> 01:07:43,074
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just would like to know, you know, if there's any going to be any specific changes that maybe we can go back to residents that complain or have complained in the past and say, yes, you know, I really feel that that's going to be one thing that she spoke about that she is going to do.

914
01:07:43,254 --> 01:07:48,879
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to just know how, are we going to have any, you know, disciplinary action?

915
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there going to be any, um,

916
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:58,407
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if any such type classes that our personnel are going to go to.

917
01:07:58,427 --> 01:08:03,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to see what type of changes there will be just to make sure that that is going to happen.

918
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:04,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope, you know, I hope it does.

919
01:08:05,652 --> 01:08:10,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe this is almost, you know, you run a city almost like it is a business.

920
01:08:10,455 --> 01:08:15,418
[SPEAKER_10]: It's $150 million budget that we have and we hire a lot of people.

921
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:21,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to make sure that we do strive to do better and strive to treat people better, obviously.

922
01:08:22,684 --> 01:08:32,707
[SPEAKER_10]: I really hope that that change is in the works and would like to know if she can give us any insight with regards to how that change may be coming to fruition.

923
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

924
01:08:33,647 --> 01:08:38,729
[SPEAKER_07]: And the motion for approval by council along with current roll call, uh, chair recognizes council.

925
01:08:38,869 --> 01:08:39,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

926
01:08:39,789 --> 01:08:49,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, last week, uh, I had the opportunity to attend one of the, uh, the mayor's constituent services, uh, meetings in West Medford and that, um,

927
01:08:50,670 --> 01:09:02,415
[SPEAKER_02]: the two common complaints throughout the whole meeting were City Hall able to communicate with people and getting to the right departments and customer service and public works.

928
01:09:03,675 --> 01:09:16,200
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully when that committee makes their recommendations, it'll take the concerns of the citizens, because as I said, this was one of the major concerns of most of the citizens.

929
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,801
[SPEAKER_02]: And the meeting I went to, they probably spent about

930
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,301
[SPEAKER_02]: 35, 45 minutes just on this particular issue.

931
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:33,262
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is, Councilor Longo is correct, and a lot of citizens have recognized it, and hopefully their transition team will make the proper recommendations.

932
01:09:34,743 --> 01:09:35,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

933
01:09:36,143 --> 01:09:37,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

934
01:09:38,663 --> 01:09:41,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Longo for putting this on.

935
01:09:42,904 --> 01:09:47,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Regarding customer service, we're all aware that the City of Method will implement the 311

936
01:09:49,513 --> 01:09:51,173
[SPEAKER_03]: C-Click and Fix program.

937
01:09:51,933 --> 01:09:55,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it's going to be March or April, and that's long awaited.

938
01:09:55,554 --> 01:09:58,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank the administration for moving forward on this.

939
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:17,158
[SPEAKER_03]: However, Mr. President, I read online inside Method that the C-Click and Fix has been used for the past several years so Method residents can go on and put on a request that they may have for city service.

940
01:10:17,858 --> 01:10:18,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went online.

941
01:10:19,642 --> 01:10:38,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I put C-Click Fix Method, and indeed it brought up 240 postings since 2009 of Method residents going on the C-Click and Fix saying, I have a pothole in front of my house, or I'm concerned the stop sign fell down in front of my house, how do I get it repaired?

942
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:47,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And needless to say, these requests that residents believe are going to someone here at City Hall are going nowhere.

943
01:10:48,387 --> 01:10:55,111
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked through to see if there were response or if any of these issues were closed and I couldn't find one response.

944
01:10:55,952 --> 01:10:56,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't find anything.

945
01:10:57,373 --> 01:11:07,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sent an email back to the editor of inside method saying, um, you know, where did this all come about that people are reaching out to see click and fix when it's not implemented in the city yet.

946
01:11:07,839 --> 01:11:14,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've been doing it since 2009 and she had no idea why people would have gone on that site.

947
01:11:14,683 --> 01:11:15,724
[SPEAKER_03]: But this gets back to,

948
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,823
[SPEAKER_03]: the issue we've been talking about, customer service, and the fact that the city never had anything set up.

949
01:11:22,223 --> 01:11:32,808
[SPEAKER_03]: So people in the community are reaching out to, in any format they can, they're reaching out to an application that the city doesn't even subscribe to, to try to get answers.

950
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,369
[SPEAKER_03]: The department heads on on.

951
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:44,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping with this new administration, and I think we're seeing some movement now, which makes me quite happy in that direction.

952
01:11:45,355 --> 01:11:49,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm looking forward to this implementation.

953
01:11:50,318 --> 01:12:07,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week I mentioned that you can implement all the systems you want, but unless we have the boots on the street, unless we have the capability of responding back and actually fixing some of the concerns, this program will not be a success.

954
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:14,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it has to be followed with additional personnel in DPW, additional personnel in

955
01:12:14,688 --> 01:12:19,510
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the other departments, like we're seeing police, fire, across the board on the municipal side.

956
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:28,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you know, we're going to have a great system set up to capture requests from residents, but not be able to resolve any of the issues, Mr. President.

957
01:12:29,234 --> 01:12:31,135
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think that has to be the second part.

958
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:37,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if the administration has that as a second option.

959
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:39,789
[SPEAKER_07]: but it needs to take place, Mr. President.

960
01:12:39,869 --> 01:12:49,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I may, Councilor, is that an amendment that we get a response back from the administration regarding the status of Seek, Click, and Fix within our municipality?

961
01:12:49,876 --> 01:13:00,144
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be a request, and Councilor Lungo and I offered a couple weeks ago that we receive a full training of the program itself, and we have yet to get a response back.

962
01:13:00,465 --> 01:13:04,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, have we got a response back regarding training for members of this council?

963
01:13:06,204 --> 01:13:07,384
[SPEAKER_03]: That just went out last week.

964
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:15,548
[SPEAKER_03]: But we even asked before that, we asked before that, that we be part of the process.

965
01:13:16,568 --> 01:13:17,389
[SPEAKER_03]: In December or?

966
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:21,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe in December, but department heads have been trained on this system already.

967
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:35,936
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason why we as city officials who failed a lot of these calls should also be trained on this and be able to point people in the right direction when they reach out to us, phone call, email, and be able to explain this new

968
01:13:36,407 --> 01:13:40,769
[SPEAKER_03]: particular program that's going to be implemented, the 3-1-1 system, Mr. President.

969
01:13:40,789 --> 01:13:49,312
[SPEAKER_07]: So be it further resolved that an additional request for a training of the City Council regarding the implementation of the 3-1-1 system.

970
01:13:49,392 --> 01:13:50,993
[SPEAKER_07]: And what you said about staffing is fine.

971
01:13:51,413 --> 01:13:53,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

972
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:54,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

973
01:13:56,155 --> 01:13:59,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Schapelle.

974
01:14:00,897 --> 01:14:05,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Regarding the 3-1-1, it's a very slippery slope right now.

975
01:14:06,732 --> 01:14:11,055
[SPEAKER_16]: The—understanding what the intent is, I think, has to be defined through the administration a little bit better.

976
01:14:11,956 --> 01:14:30,369
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's implemented to collect data, then to look into hiring policies, because I agree with you, Counsel Marks, that I work in the system that within 48 hours of a 311 call to my office, I have to respond to that constituent.

977
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:36,554
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, if not, it's reverted to our summer stat.

978
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:49,474
[SPEAKER_16]: organization that the mayor sits on, and then that data is then pushed directly to us, and answers have to be given to why they weren't or were answered.

979
01:14:50,094 --> 01:15:06,220
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that an understanding of what the true definition of this program, when it is presented to the community, and how we handle it, because I firmly believe in what

980
01:15:07,514 --> 01:15:13,095
[SPEAKER_16]: echo your thoughts and without the proper people on the streets doing the work.

981
01:15:13,595 --> 01:15:21,997
[SPEAKER_16]: And a lot of times people answering that phone and moving it to department to department, um, is going to be essential making this work.

982
01:15:22,177 --> 01:15:36,360
[SPEAKER_16]: If not, I think this could be, uh, an even more volatile issue than you even can think of because it, um, what we do is understanding that the, the three one system where it's implemented in some level, it's then,

983
01:15:37,441 --> 01:15:37,901
[SPEAKER_16]: carried over.

984
01:15:37,921 --> 01:15:40,263
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like having a 9-1-1 system without a police department.

985
01:15:40,283 --> 01:15:43,925
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's, um, it's very important.

986
01:15:44,045 --> 01:15:44,526
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

987
01:15:45,286 --> 01:15:45,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

988
01:15:45,626 --> 01:15:46,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor.

989
01:15:46,427 --> 01:15:51,990
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion for approval by council longer current as amended, uh, clerk, Mr. Clerk, please call.

990
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:52,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.

991
01:15:53,351 --> 01:15:54,072
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

992
01:15:54,172 --> 01:15:55,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, madam citizen.

993
01:15:56,033 --> 01:15:57,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Jean Martin, 10 coming street.

994
01:15:57,814 --> 01:16:02,837
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to that same meeting that Mr. Caraviello went to on constituency, constituency services.

995
01:16:03,558 --> 01:16:03,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

996
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:11,409
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're absolutely right, Mr. Marks, if you do not have more people in the areas that were most discussed.

997
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of wonder, because now you've set up this expectation.

998
01:16:14,851 --> 01:16:17,972
[SPEAKER_01]: These people came out, and they didn't just come out from West Medford.

999
01:16:17,992 --> 01:16:21,874
[SPEAKER_01]: They came out from all over the areas of Medford, and they came to this meeting.

1000
01:16:22,394 --> 01:16:25,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's a belief system that things are going to change.

1001
01:16:27,076 --> 01:16:31,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that things change, because now you've set up the expectation that things are going to change.

1002
01:16:31,613 --> 01:16:35,435
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way that they're going to change is if you hire more DPW workers and more police.

1003
01:16:35,935 --> 01:16:49,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the two biggest issues that came up were, one, parking enforcement, street sweeping, plowing, especially plowing in the winter, and all of the car issues and all of that.

1004
01:16:50,403 --> 01:16:53,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the DPW potholes and you name it.

1005
01:16:54,405 --> 01:16:58,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we do not hire more DPW workers and more police or

1006
01:16:59,636 --> 01:17:07,198
[SPEAKER_01]: reutilize our police so that they're in enforcement mode, then the 311 system is going to be absolutely useless.

1007
01:17:07,558 --> 01:17:09,659
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to set up the expectation that I'm going to be heard.

1008
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:12,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if they're not heard, they're going to be even more frustrated.

1009
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to point that out.

1010
01:17:14,781 --> 01:17:22,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have to figure out something to do because there's not enough DPW workers to take care of the issues in this city.

1011
01:17:22,923 --> 01:17:26,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, like you said, at the high school, they can't even salt the hill.

1012
01:17:27,004 --> 01:17:28,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.

1013
01:17:28,885 --> 01:17:29,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1014
01:17:30,801 --> 01:17:31,581
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President.

1015
01:17:31,841 --> 01:17:33,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Just with that point, thank you, President Dello Russo.

1016
01:17:33,902 --> 01:17:35,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with my colleagues.

1017
01:17:35,102 --> 01:17:36,002
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with Ms.

1018
01:17:36,022 --> 01:17:36,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Martin.

1019
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:42,303
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think implementing the 311 system is definitely necessary and a good start.

1020
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:47,364
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's going to show us, okay, we need more staff on the highway.

1021
01:17:47,484 --> 01:17:55,226
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to order more filler for our potholes because we have 300 complaints within a matter of six months.

1022
01:17:55,286 --> 01:17:59,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's going to tell us we need to get on waste management because they missed picking up

1023
01:18:00,748 --> 01:18:02,190
[SPEAKER_10]: 70 barrels this week.

1024
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:29,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's going to tell us where the problems are, and obviously there's going to be, like Councilor Scarpelli said, there's going to be a transition period that may be very bumpy, because we're going to need to put some more personnel on, and I think that's going to be very important, and it's going to be a true tell to the residents and to the people of the city, we need to spend this money and hire five new DPW personnel, or else we're not going to get to half of these complaints and be able to

1025
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:49,777
[SPEAKER_10]: improve on the things we need to improve on, but I think it's definitely going to work in benefit in the long run, and it's definitely going to be very transparent, and we're going to know if people complain that, you know, certain personnel aren't doing their job, well, we're going to have a record and say, you know, they are, they are.

1026
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:57,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at what they've done within the last, you know, look at, for example, look at what our DPW department has done within the last two weeks alone.

1027
01:18:59,239 --> 01:19:03,582
[SPEAKER_10]: 67, you know, for example, complaints and resolves and action taken.

1028
01:19:03,682 --> 01:19:06,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's going to, in the long run, it's going to work.

1029
01:19:06,884 --> 01:19:21,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the administration is fiscally on top of it, and we are going to be able to put personnel where we need to put personnel, and I think we're going to have a much better work ethic on top of it if we don't have a stellar one already.

1030
01:19:23,637 --> 01:19:23,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1031
01:19:23,997 --> 01:19:27,360
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion for approval as amended, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1032
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:30,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello?

1033
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:30,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1034
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:31,911

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

1041
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:36,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1042
01:19:37,332 --> 01:19:38,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1043
01:19:38,032 --> 01:19:38,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: President De La Ruza?

1045
01:19:39,853 --> 01:19:40,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1046
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:42,994
[SPEAKER_07]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

1047
01:19:43,014 --> 01:19:54,217
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-038, petition for common vitualist license by Noe Tejada, 96 Ferry Street, Everett, Massachusetts, president of Iris Family Restaurant, Incorporated.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1052
01:20:19,454 --> 01:20:21,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Turner, which business are you taking over?

1053
01:20:23,810 --> 01:20:26,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Practically, I'm just getting off from LLC to incorporated.

1054
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:27,331
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1055
01:20:28,492 --> 01:20:34,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I reviewed the papers, and I assume the hours are going to stay the same, 7 to 11?

1056
01:20:34,473 --> 01:20:35,354
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

1057
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:39,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I reviewed the papers, find everything in order, and motion for approval.

1058
01:20:39,755 --> 01:20:42,616
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion approved by Councilor Caraviello, Chairman.

[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

1066
01:20:59,534 --> 01:21:08,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by myself, President Dello Russo, it be resolved that the Medford City Council offered sincere condolences to the family of Nicholas Andrea Tola on his recent passing.

1067
01:21:08,959 --> 01:21:11,761
[SPEAKER_07]: If you would all rise to join me in a moment of silence.

1068
01:21:31,081 --> 01:21:35,524
[SPEAKER_07]: The records of the meeting of January 12, 2016, were passed to Councilor Falco.

1069
01:21:36,365 --> 01:21:38,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, how did you find those records?

1070
01:21:38,347 --> 01:21:39,147

[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Madam Vice President.

1077
01:21:51,136 --> 01:21:57,721
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to announce a fundraiser for juvenile diabetes being held for actually one of our gym teachers.

1078
01:21:59,201 --> 01:22:01,222
[SPEAKER_10]: physical education teachers, 6 p.m.

1079
01:22:01,282 --> 01:22:02,642
[SPEAKER_10]: on Friday night at the Elks.

1080
01:22:03,402 --> 01:22:04,343
[SPEAKER_10]: She's running, Ms.

1081
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:08,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Richard is running the marathon in support of juvenile diabetes.

1082
01:22:08,604 --> 01:22:10,204
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know a number of people will be there.

1083
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:11,065
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great cause.

1084
01:22:11,085 --> 01:22:12,705
[SPEAKER_10]: They can have raffle prizes and food.

1085
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:17,787
[SPEAKER_10]: So I invite everybody who would like to join to come down and show your support.

1086
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:18,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1087
01:22:19,687 --> 01:22:19,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1088
01:22:20,027 --> 01:22:21,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1089
01:22:21,748 --> 01:22:22,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1090
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:28,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week, the council brought up the issue with the Craddock Bridge and the business owners in that particular area.

1091
01:22:29,547 --> 01:22:32,789
[SPEAKER_03]: and the lack of addressing some of the concerns by DOT.

1092
01:22:33,329 --> 01:22:39,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we heard any response back regarding the barriers and access to some of the properties?

1093
01:22:40,892 --> 01:22:43,153
[SPEAKER_07]: I've received nothing in an official capacity.

1094
01:22:44,073 --> 01:22:49,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Councilor Caraviello can share with us anything as he was on the grounds with that.

1095
01:22:49,356 --> 01:22:54,018
[SPEAKER_02]: As of today, there's been no action taken on anything that we've asked for.

1096
01:22:55,033 --> 01:23:03,177
[SPEAKER_07]: The requests went out, Mr. Clerk, to the Traffic Commission and to the City Engineer, I believe, as well.

1097
01:23:03,797 --> 01:23:05,758
[SPEAKER_07]: And those requests went out on Thursday.

1098
01:23:08,919 --> 01:23:11,240
[SPEAKER_07]: They went out to the Mayor's office on Thursday.

1099
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,841
[SPEAKER_02]: So then they went out to the other offices.

1100
01:23:12,861 --> 01:23:14,982
[SPEAKER_02]: As of today, the barriers are still closed.

1101
01:23:15,002 --> 01:23:22,505
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked for an opening in the barrier there to help the businesses out there, even to allow some parking in front of the restaurants.

1102
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:29,005
[SPEAKER_02]: and businesses there in the evening to help out, and no responsibility there.

1103
01:23:29,025 --> 01:23:36,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Councilor Marksley, this group is being very unresponsive to the needs of the community.

1104
01:23:39,334 --> 01:23:42,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor.

1105
01:23:42,878 --> 01:23:48,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this a recommendation that we order a work of stoppage to the,

1106
01:23:49,762 --> 01:23:52,824
[SPEAKER_03]: If we didn't receive a response, that's what we discussed last week.

1107
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:56,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be up to the council.

1108
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:58,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair recommends Councilor Knight.

1109
01:24:01,027 --> 01:24:07,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think that we have a couple of different avenues we could take to address the issue.

1110
01:24:08,571 --> 01:24:09,612
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy to call a

1111
01:24:11,072 --> 01:24:19,474
[SPEAKER_05]: subcommittee meeting on intergovernmental affairs, see if we can get our representatives from the state house down here as well as representatives from the administration, from the business community.

1112
01:24:19,674 --> 01:24:23,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And from the project to sit down in the same room and see if we can work something out, Mr. President.

1113
01:24:23,535 --> 01:24:24,915
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting ridiculous.

1114
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:31,596
[SPEAKER_02]: To respect my Councilor Knight, we were down there last week with the representative, representative Donato.

1115
01:24:31,916 --> 01:24:33,097
[SPEAKER_02]: The DOT was there.

1116
01:24:34,217 --> 01:24:36,177
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, don't worry, we'll take care of everything.

1117
01:24:36,998 --> 01:24:38,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it's gone.

1118
01:24:40,267 --> 01:24:46,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than take away the barrier in front of the front door, none of the other requests I would ask for have been met.

1119
01:24:47,372 --> 01:24:57,320
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, Mr. President, I went down last Wednesday evening at the request of a business owner to a site visit down there, and there's a lot of signage that's very confusing.

1120
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly don't think that there's a accessible pathway to get from

1121
01:25:03,324 --> 01:25:09,568
[SPEAKER_05]: the parking facility behind Donuts with a difference to, say, REMAX or that side of the square, Mr. President.

1122
01:25:09,608 --> 01:25:15,391
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that there's a number of issues going on that are something we can address.

1123
01:25:16,052 --> 01:25:20,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But the way we're going to get them done, I think, is by working together and sitting down in the same room and trying to iron them out.

1124
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:26,998
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we could have Diane McLeod and the Office of Disability take a look at the accessible pathway.

1125
01:25:27,354 --> 01:25:37,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there are a number of different approaches that we could take, and I just think it's about sitting down and coming up with a comprehensive strategy where we're all on the same page, working to effectuate the same positive goal.

1126
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:41,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think that DOT is standing in the way of us trying to get something done here.

1127
01:25:41,743 --> 01:25:44,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And unless we show a unified front, we're not going to be able to accomplish that.

1128
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:55,932
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I say it might be time that we bring our elected delegation, as well as the administration, into the same room and develop a strategy as to how we're going to approach them and address what's going on and why our requests are falling on deaf ears.

1129
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:57,445
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1130
01:25:57,725 --> 01:26:01,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I must say that I'm quite disappointed that we haven't received an official response.

1131
01:26:02,148 --> 01:26:03,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1132
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:24,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the city solicitor is prepared to discuss this, but maybe if we can ask his legal opinion, what our next step is as the legislative body in this community, because I hear what Councilor Knight's saying about sitting down and coming up with comprehensive plans and so forth, but this has been an ongoing issue for a long period of time.

1133
01:26:24,940 --> 01:26:32,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we can, in good faith, tell the business owners any longer that we're going to, you know, hold this up any further.

1134
01:26:32,223 --> 01:26:35,904
[SPEAKER_03]: A day lost is a dollar lost for these businesses.

1135
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:39,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, as one member, think we're at the point right now.

1136
01:26:39,806 --> 01:26:40,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to work with people.

1137
01:26:41,006 --> 01:26:46,688
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we're at the point right now where we have to send a stronger message, and that message may be a halt at work.

1138
01:26:47,048 --> 01:26:51,130
[SPEAKER_03]: And you better believe they'll sit down at the table immediately and address some of the concerns.

1139
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:54,131
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd like to pose that question to you, Mr. Solicitor.

1140
01:26:54,426 --> 01:26:58,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the first thing I'd say, Mark Rumley, City Solicitor, 50 Woodrow Avenue.

1141
01:26:59,049 --> 01:27:07,414
[SPEAKER_15]: The first thing I would say is that any type of action like that, when you talk about stoppage of work, it's not a matter of going down there and everybody just goes home.

1142
01:27:07,935 --> 01:27:10,376
[SPEAKER_15]: It would have to be some type of compulsion behind it.

1143
01:27:10,716 --> 01:27:15,159
[SPEAKER_15]: And that compulsion is always judicial, that is to tell people to stop.

1144
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:24,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So what would have to precede any type of effort like that is a meeting where all of the data, all of the communications, all of the requests,

1145
01:27:24,652 --> 01:27:28,215
[SPEAKER_15]: that have been made and the reasonability of those requests.

1146
01:27:28,776 --> 01:27:32,059
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, the council may have asked that A be done.

1147
01:27:32,119 --> 01:27:40,667
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, there may be a valid reason why A hasn't been done, but perhaps you've asked that B should be done, and maybe it's valid that that should be done.

1148
01:27:41,147 --> 01:27:48,494
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'm saying is that when you lock and load for purposes of litigation, that should never be the initial response.

1149
01:27:48,534 --> 01:27:50,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I'm not suggesting that that would be

1150
01:27:50,586 --> 01:27:57,314
[SPEAKER_15]: the first thing that this council's done because you've been diligent in asking questions and trying to get information on a regular basis.

1151
01:27:57,854 --> 01:28:06,224
[SPEAKER_15]: But what I am saying as your legal advisor is before you lock and load and say pull the trigger, let's make sure that we're standing on solid ground.

1152
01:28:06,778 --> 01:28:13,082
[SPEAKER_15]: and that all other avenues which could yield some benefit have been exhausted before that step is taken.

1153
01:28:13,642 --> 01:28:18,385
[SPEAKER_15]: That said, I think what's occurring right now is the frustration level is rising.

1154
01:28:19,686 --> 01:28:29,012
[SPEAKER_15]: I made a walk through the square with some other department heads with Mayor Burke just the week before last, and I saw that area where the activity was going on.

1155
01:28:29,372 --> 01:28:34,115
[SPEAKER_15]: And if that were to just stop, I mean, if it just like froze like you see in commercials,

1156
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:40,784
[SPEAKER_15]: There would be some type of difficulty to that because there's already been alterations made and things of that nature have been done.

1157
01:28:41,584 --> 01:28:44,025
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I'm saying is that I understand your motivation.

1158
01:28:44,526 --> 01:28:52,390
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying that it's imprudent or unreasonable, but I think that this type of activity has to be done with a deliberate discernment.

1159
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:57,153
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to proceed in a proper fashion and I know that that's exactly what you'd want.

1160
01:28:57,973 --> 01:29:03,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So should we be bringing in the building commissioner and office of community development to work on

1161
01:29:04,928 --> 01:29:06,449
[SPEAKER_03]: or in concert with this council?

1162
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:10,092
[SPEAKER_15]: And the police department to talk about what they've had there.

1163
01:29:10,132 --> 01:29:12,114
[SPEAKER_15]: They've had some input there.

1164
01:29:12,174 --> 01:29:17,478
[SPEAKER_15]: This project, as everyone knows, is a massive project that's going on, I guess, for years.

1165
01:29:18,499 --> 01:29:21,641
[SPEAKER_15]: And where that's the case, we're going to have a lot of concerns.

1166
01:29:21,701 --> 01:29:28,706
[SPEAKER_15]: But the idea of stopping that until those concerns are met, that might be a little bit draconian.

1167
01:29:29,027 --> 01:29:31,809
[SPEAKER_15]: But nonetheless, it's in the cards as a possibility.

1168
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:38,953
[SPEAKER_02]: In all due respects, I mean, how many times are we going to make requests?

1169
01:29:39,493 --> 01:29:42,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I stayed down until 10.30 one night to meet with the DOT.

1170
01:29:43,798 --> 01:29:45,279
[SPEAKER_02]: They came and made promises again.

1171
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:47,862
[SPEAKER_02]: They were there the next day, made promises.

1172
01:29:51,766 --> 01:29:54,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect your opinion, but we should be locked and loaded.

1173
01:29:56,895 --> 01:29:58,856
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sort of just snubbing everything we say.

1174
01:29:58,917 --> 01:30:04,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you can't do something, give us a reason why you can't do it.

1175
01:30:04,661 --> 01:30:06,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just ignore us and walk away.

1176
01:30:06,482 --> 01:30:07,383
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're doing.

1177
01:30:07,743 --> 01:30:09,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the bus stop's going to get out of there.

1178
01:30:10,325 --> 01:30:16,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you see when the bus pulls up, there's no room for it.

1179
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:19,952
[SPEAKER_02]: That bus stop's going to go to another spot, which they've been promising to move.

1180
01:30:20,473 --> 01:30:21,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't happened.

1181
01:30:21,293 --> 01:30:22,454
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand, Councilor.

1182
01:30:22,895 --> 01:30:24,576
[SPEAKER_15]: Essentially, you're preaching to the choir.

1183
01:30:25,505 --> 01:30:32,350
[SPEAKER_15]: But I would also say that in order to move forward, even though the frustration level that you have is reasonable, I get that.

1184
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:45,238
[SPEAKER_15]: But in order to take certain legal moves to stop a state contract of this magnitude with all of the different moving parts that are in play, that has to be done by prudent heads, not reactionary.

1185
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:49,701
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm not suggesting for a second that any member of this council is being reactionary.

1186
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:50,781
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not suggesting that.

1187
01:30:51,161 --> 01:30:53,563
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm saying that litigation has its ramifications.

1188
01:30:53,959 --> 01:30:55,760
[SPEAKER_15]: and must proceed properly.

1189
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:56,380
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all.

1190
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,041
[SPEAKER_15]: But I certainly share all that.

1191
01:30:58,081 --> 01:31:00,662
[SPEAKER_15]: I've tried to cross the street in that area.

1192
01:31:00,722 --> 01:31:08,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, I mean, if this is going to go on for the next two and a half years and we get some, uh, we've got some problems and we're only, we're only in the beginning stage.

1193
01:31:09,545 --> 01:31:09,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1194
01:31:09,925 --> 01:31:15,127
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that, um, the continued focus and the concern that's been brought by this council is commendable.

1195
01:31:15,508 --> 01:31:20,230
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm hopeful, hopeful with state delegation and others that it can be as some results.

1196
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:21,310
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it doesn't,

1197
01:31:21,993 --> 01:31:23,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, then let's prepare to cross that bridge.

1198
01:31:25,595 --> 01:31:26,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Which I didn't mean a pun.

1199
01:31:27,937 --> 01:31:29,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

1200
01:31:30,038 --> 01:31:44,807
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can, we still, another issue that concerns me is that with any big job as a project manager, have we identified what department is actually in charge of this project?

1201
01:31:44,827 --> 01:31:50,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I've looked into other communities that are working with DOT and it's,

1202
01:31:51,432 --> 01:32:02,443
[SPEAKER_16]: it's very simple when you talk about this type of issue is the liaison from the city that's there is the one that's enforcing and dictating what's going on there.

1203
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:03,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1204
01:32:03,183 --> 01:32:05,505
[SPEAKER_16]: So I, do we, do we have that?

1205
01:32:05,926 --> 01:32:13,273
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a gentleman from Zoppo construction, if I could, a Councilor who addressed the council some twice in the past several months.

1206
01:32:13,693 --> 01:32:16,436
[SPEAKER_07]: And I believe that actually the

1207
01:32:16,792 --> 01:32:19,933
[SPEAKER_07]: point person on behalf of the city is the office of the engineer.

1208
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:21,513
[SPEAKER_07]: So the engineers.

1209
01:32:22,014 --> 01:32:23,614
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not the DPW.

1210
01:32:24,334 --> 01:32:24,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1211
01:32:24,614 --> 01:32:46,441
[SPEAKER_16]: So if I can, and being prudent and, and looking into all of those department heads coming ahead of us in front of us next week, if we can, and, and understanding our frustration and that we are making sure that our gun is loaded per se, that, that, that we need to,

1212
01:32:47,035 --> 01:32:48,435
[SPEAKER_16]: have them here to answer that.

1213
01:32:49,176 --> 01:32:52,797
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, you know, even recommend a site visit.

1214
01:32:52,817 --> 01:33:14,483
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that we've also on the school side at times when there were issues with custodial services and cleaning services, we visited us, uh, our, and I think people need to know the frustrations with the business owners in that area that, that it's a voice that we asked for all those, the department heads of police, um, the engineering,

1215
01:33:14,957 --> 01:33:33,454
[SPEAKER_16]: DPW and the business owners with, of course, DOT, that we evaluate this issue and making sure that they understand at the podium that we're willing to do what needs to be done to make sure that our business owners and our constituents' issues are heard.

1216
01:33:34,715 --> 01:33:34,975
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1217
01:33:35,447 --> 01:33:36,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1218
01:33:36,348 --> 01:33:40,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have a motion, though, before us that this go to subcommittee.

1219
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:41,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President?

1220
01:33:41,372 --> 01:33:43,334
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1221
01:33:43,474 --> 01:33:44,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1222
01:33:45,576 --> 01:33:58,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not a bad idea of sending it to subcommittee, but I actually like the idea of having a committee of the whole just on this one topic where we're all involved, because I just think this is huge.

1223
01:33:58,166 --> 01:34:01,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're talking about people who own businesses.

1224
01:34:01,789 --> 01:34:03,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Their livelihoods are being affected.

1225
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:04,031
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've all been

1226
01:34:04,759 --> 01:34:07,140
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to business owners within the community.

1227
01:34:07,841 --> 01:34:11,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like Councilor Scarpelli's idea of bringing all the department heads in.

1228
01:34:12,003 --> 01:34:14,064
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that is something that we need to do.

1229
01:34:14,084 --> 01:34:16,385
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to have the DOT here as well.

1230
01:34:16,766 --> 01:34:23,329
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we need to all be in one meeting where this is the main focus of the meeting, and we all get on the same page.

1231
01:34:23,409 --> 01:34:27,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think a community of the whole would be ideal for something like this.

1232
01:34:27,471 --> 01:34:33,915
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's a good idea, if we can all community of the whole in asking for engineering, DPW,

1233
01:34:34,948 --> 01:34:37,929
[SPEAKER_16]: police DOT, uh, next week.

1234
01:34:38,109 --> 01:34:42,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1235
01:34:42,611 --> 01:34:45,613
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, if I'm counsel, please continue.

1236
01:34:46,273 --> 01:34:59,218
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if I, if I may, I would say maybe not necessarily on a meeting a night where we have a council meeting, because I think that this is something, especially if you're having all kinds of department heads that are coming, you're talking about a lot of time.

1237
01:34:59,759 --> 01:35:03,080
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's something that we should be rushing through to get through

1238
01:35:03,517 --> 01:35:05,038
[SPEAKER_00]: get to our regular scheduled meeting.

1239
01:35:05,098 --> 01:35:07,900
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I think that's going to take time and a lot of thought.

1240
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:16,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if we have department heads coming, the DOT coming, all of us, I think there's going to be a lot of people that are going to want to chime in on things.

1241
01:35:16,245 --> 01:35:17,806
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to take some time.

1242
01:35:18,647 --> 01:35:19,047
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

1243
01:35:19,427 --> 01:35:19,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor?

1244
01:35:20,148 --> 01:35:21,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Councilor Falco.

1245
01:35:22,109 --> 01:35:25,792
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have this on a, maybe a Wednesday night or a Tuesday night, I'm not Wednesday or Thursday night.

1246
01:35:26,432 --> 01:35:32,356
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the mayor said, the, the point person on this is the city engineer and we've not seen the city engineer once.

1247
01:35:34,035 --> 01:35:39,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I've not seen a city engineer come to any meeting when the construction company was here.

1248
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:48,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I would say the first person to call is the engineer and get her on this.

1249
01:35:49,206 --> 01:35:50,427
[SPEAKER_02]: She seems to have dropped the ball.

1250
01:35:51,007 --> 01:35:51,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1251
01:35:52,088 --> 01:35:52,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam citizen.

1252
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a real quick comment.

1253
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:55,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martin, 10 coming street.

1254
01:35:55,811 --> 01:35:59,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to the pre meetings for this bridge work and

1255
01:36:01,283 --> 01:36:05,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Senator Jalen was there and Representative Donato was there as well to most of these meetings.

1256
01:36:06,185 --> 01:36:09,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are they in this problem solving?

1257
01:36:12,446 --> 01:36:12,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1258
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:14,687
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

1259
01:36:14,947 --> 01:36:16,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm just saying, I'm just asking, where are they?

1260
01:36:16,968 --> 01:36:17,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Can they?

1261
01:36:18,223 --> 01:36:25,165
[SPEAKER_08]: be liaisons to these agencies for us.

1262
01:36:27,546 --> 01:36:27,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1263
01:36:28,086 --> 01:36:28,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1264
01:36:28,706 --> 01:36:29,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1265
01:36:29,307 --> 01:36:36,069
[SPEAKER_07]: There'll be a meeting of the committee of the whole Wednesday at six o'clock in the city council office.

1266
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:45,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, the clerk is going to invite, uh, the city, uh, engineer, uh, the, uh, state delegation.

1267
01:36:46,188 --> 01:36:55,814
[SPEAKER_07]: and a representative Mr. Daly of department of transportation, as well as a representative of Zoppo construction to meet with the city council on this matter.

1268
01:36:56,334 --> 01:37:05,279
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have present with us also, uh, the, uh, city solicitor Wednesday coming not tomorrow, the following Wednesday.

1269
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:12,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, if I, if I could add just one thing, it's not really a legal advice.

1270
01:37:12,103 --> 01:37:12,463
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just,

1271
01:37:12,982 --> 01:37:29,947
[SPEAKER_15]: with all of the people and all of the effort and the focus that you want to bring to this type of a meeting, probably also be beneficial to set up some type of a central place electronically where people who can't attend the meeting can share their own experiences and thoughts in that area, not only as pedestrians, but also driving through there.

1272
01:37:30,327 --> 01:37:39,230
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think I can talk to the city clerk about that so we could have a repository of other comments and experiences of people who perhaps can't make that meeting.

1273
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:44,795
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no need for us not to go forward with those comments, especially in this age.

1274
01:37:45,335 --> 01:37:45,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1275
01:37:46,596 --> 01:37:48,036
[SPEAKER_07]: What's next Wednesday's date?

1276
01:37:53,857 --> 01:37:54,137
[SPEAKER_07]: 27th.

1277
01:37:54,177 --> 01:37:54,517
[SPEAKER_07]: 27th.

1278
01:37:55,838 --> 01:37:56,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1279
01:37:56,798 --> 01:37:57,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Citizen.

1280
01:37:59,879 --> 01:38:00,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1281
01:38:01,439 --> 01:38:02,279
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to adjourn.

1282
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Castagnetti wishes to.

1283
01:38:08,231 --> 01:38:08,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1284
01:38:08,751 --> 01:38:10,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1285
01:38:10,572 --> 01:38:10,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1286
01:38:11,132 --> 01:38:13,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue for mass.

1287
01:38:14,133 --> 01:38:22,015
[SPEAKER_13]: If we need a repository for comments and such, we should have a mobile public access TV and broadcast it on the government channel.

1288
01:38:22,255 --> 01:38:25,936
[SPEAKER_13]: We can accomplish that if the esteemed city solicitor would like.

1289
01:38:26,057 --> 01:38:27,137
[SPEAKER_13]: And he knows my phone number.

1290
01:38:27,297 --> 01:38:29,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1291
01:38:34,919 --> 01:38:35,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, thank you.

1292
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:37,220
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thought you forgot something.

1293
01:38:38,201 --> 01:38:38,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Go Patriots!

1294
01:39:30,986 --> 01:39:32,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for adjournment.

1295
01:39:34,031 --> 01:39:37,177
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of adjournment by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1296
01:39:37,197 --> 01:39:37,898
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1297
01:39:38,279 --> 01:39:38,800
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?
