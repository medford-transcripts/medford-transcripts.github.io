[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner Kerins, welcome.

103
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:07,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Mr. President, Madam Vice President, members of the Council.

104
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:20,156
[SPEAKER_07]: As stated, Mr. President, the City of Medford began to receive the reimbursement monies for the winter of 2015.

105
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:32,611
[SPEAKER_07]: That particular year, we'll probably never forget, we were highly impacted, particularly the month of January, with, you know, not inches, but feet of snow.

106
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:46,035
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a declaration declared by the governor at the time, and FEMA entered into the picture, and reimbursement process began shortly thereafter.

107
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,276
[SPEAKER_07]: What's happening now is the checks are beginning to arrive.

108
00:05:52,265 --> 00:05:57,429
[SPEAKER_07]: back to the cities and towns that were impacted by the storm.

109
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:10,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I have attached here a cover sheet with the breakdown of the actual monies as far as where I would like to, you know, spread them out.

110
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:20,585
[SPEAKER_07]: When the approvals came in and the money started arriving, the first order of business was to make sure that there was no outstanding debts.

111
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:50,017
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, as a result of that storm, working very closely with Auditor Baker, you know, my office staff and I, we pulled together a wish list that I went to the mayor with that we desperately could use that money, which was above and beyond what the Council had approved earlier in the budget, to assist us in trying to speed up the process in different areas that we were, you know, actually being impacted with.

112
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,841
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, due to, you know, time, manpower, money and so forth.

113
00:06:54,541 --> 00:07:03,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, the first installment as you'll see on the, uh, uh, for on the, uh, cover sheet, uh, was, uh, $287,000.

114
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:10,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, that check has arrived and has been, uh, uh, deposited by the city.

115
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:17,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the two other checks that are still outstanding, the one 44, three,

116
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:26,813
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still in the reviewing process within FEMA and the federal government.

117
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:41,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And an additional $174,649, that's for damages that had occurred during that storm up at the house at the cemetery and also the repair garage up there.

118
00:07:41,964 --> 00:07:46,908
[SPEAKER_07]: That's still in the hands of FEMA, subject to their approval.

119
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:51,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, just a question of time that that money will be forthcoming.

120
00:07:52,655 --> 00:08:07,742
[SPEAKER_07]: But getting back to the 287,000, what the Department of Public Works would like to request here is 100,000 just on catch basin repairs.

121
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:14,646
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, you know, numerous catch basins out in the city that have collapsed.

122
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,449
[SPEAKER_07]: They're desperately in need of repair.

123
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:25,034
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little over 4,500 catch basins in the city, just for everybody's information here.

124
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:31,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And quite honestly, you know, we cannot keep up with the demands of it.

125
00:08:31,738 --> 00:08:41,204
[SPEAKER_07]: And what, you know, we're requesting is that, you know, putting out, you know, just a rebuilding contract to rebuild the basins.

126
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:52,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Cost per basin, it could vary within the industry depending on the condition of the catch basin that you'd be repairing.

127
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:59,252
[SPEAKER_07]: It could range anywhere from as low as maybe $1,500 to possibly up to $5,000.

128
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:04,355
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason the spread would be is whether or not you needed a new frame and a cover.

129
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:15,355
[SPEAKER_07]: whether or not you have to go five or six feet down into the actual basin and rebuild the walls of the actual basin itself.

130
00:09:15,715 --> 00:09:21,158
[SPEAKER_07]: So each structure is going to vary as far as cost and as far as, you know, how many we can get done.

131
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:32,164
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, we would like to hit the road running just on that contract to assist, you know, the highway department in, you know, managing, you know, the storm drain system throughout the city.

132
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,782
[SPEAKER_07]: request was for $25,000, and that's for highway ordinary sidewalks.

133
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:51,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the council was kind enough to approve and appropriate a half a million dollars for the rebuilding of sidewalks earlier this year.

134
00:09:52,584 --> 00:10:01,806
[SPEAKER_07]: The bid had gone out, and the low bidder came back as Marchesi and Son, but it came back at $543,200.

135
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:10,886
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we were appropriated, you know, $500,000.

136
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:21,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Now with some moving around of funding within our existing budget, what we need is an additional $14,000 to meet that entire cost of $543,000.

137
00:10:22,074 --> 00:10:23,415
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I did ask for $25,000, the balance of the $11,000

138
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:41,008
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, out of that 25 would go strictly, all right, for tree stump removal in the city.

139
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:52,752
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, this would go above and beyond the existing sidewalk contract, and also the language that's in there that they also remove tree stumps.

140
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:59,595
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just for stumps only, and then the repairs, whether it be for asphalt, concrete,

141
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:12,570
[SPEAKER_07]: or dirt and lumen seed, excuse me, that would be done, you know, by the in-house forces would come in behind to make, you know, the permanent repairs.

142
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:21,935
[SPEAKER_07]: That's providing that the homeowner that the stump was removed from did not request, you know, a replacement tree.

143
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,176
[SPEAKER_07]: Those would be handled differently.

144
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:28,218
[SPEAKER_07]: They would be boxed out and, you know, a new tree installed.

145
00:11:29,938 --> 00:11:40,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Now getting on to the trees, we're requesting an additional $30,000 in the tree planting account.

146
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,242
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason for that is we're going to be planting about 130, 135 trees.

147
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:58,944
[SPEAKER_07]: But the cost of the trees within one year's time, and at the very back of the packet that I gave you was a copy of last year's bid and this year's bid.

148
00:11:59,575 --> 00:12:05,419
[SPEAKER_07]: And the cost per tree has really, you know, gone up substantially.

149
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:21,831
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll notice, okay, on the existing, the first page, all right, the cost per tree has gone up, all right, $90 per tree this year compared to last.

150
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:25,073
[SPEAKER_07]: That's if it's planted in concrete or hot top.

151
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:30,656
[SPEAKER_07]: an additional $100 if it's in a grass plot or a gravel area.

152
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:44,067
[SPEAKER_07]: In order to keep up with the tree program that the city has, you know, the $30,000 would cover the new contract that, you know, once it's awarded.

153
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:51,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we can continue, you know, come in the fall and then in the spring to, you know, plant the new trees.

154
00:12:51,674 --> 00:12:56,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But the cost of trees has just dramatically increased, as you can see.

155
00:12:57,598 --> 00:13:05,704
[SPEAKER_07]: The last request that we have for the Traffic Commission is for ordinary street signs, and that's for $10,000.

156
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:18,193
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's to keep up with the ever-increasing demand of replacing worn or faded out Chapter 90 signs, directional signs,

157
00:13:19,147 --> 00:13:41,536
[SPEAKER_07]: and just informational signs that may be out there that could be worn, faded, distorted, or, you know, or hit as a result of a motor vehicle accident and that we want to, you know, replenish our stocks so that way we have, you know, pretty much every variety of sign that, you know, is requested and we can install them, you know, in a timely fashion.

158
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:47,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that detailed discourse, Commissioner.

159
00:13:48,074 --> 00:13:49,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

160
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:53,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Terrence, this money gets appropriated, say, this evening.

161
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:57,876
[SPEAKER_02]: How soon before we see the work that starts to get performed?

162
00:13:57,896 --> 00:14:03,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to try to get some of this work done before the 1st for us, or is this something that... No, Councillor.

163
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,878
[SPEAKER_07]: This would be something that would happen right away.

164
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:10,899
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the stump removals are concerned,

165
00:14:11,361 --> 00:14:25,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we already have, um, you know, assisting our forestry division, um, uh, early odorous company, uh, who comes in and assists, all right, on, you know, removing trees, uh, lifting trees with, uh, our forestry unit.

166
00:14:25,593 --> 00:14:25,813
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

167
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:31,077
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have them come in, all right, with a stump, stump grinder unit right away.

168
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:32,038
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

169
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:39,685
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would hit the ground running, um, on that as far as the Marchese, um, appropriation.

170
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:40,245
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

171
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:52,558
[SPEAKER_07]: One, if, if approved, uh, then the, uh, purchasing would, uh, award the contract and, uh, my Casey and sons would be ready to go probably within, uh, you know, a week or two's time.

172
00:14:53,178 --> 00:15:08,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, once, uh, the word is given, uh, as far as the trees are concerned, uh, the city Arborist has already, uh, been to Leo's, uh, seen, uh, some of the product that is on hand and some of the product that we would be receiving in the spring.

173
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:12,764
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty much on track as well.

174
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:27,853
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as signs are concerned, it's just a simple case of issuing a purchase order to the sign company with the quantity and the types of signs that we need, and then we'd get delivery pretty much in a timely fashion.

175
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:34,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, this is quite a well-thought-out and thorough presentation, I think.

176
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:37,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Kearns, for doing a wonderful job on it.

177
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:41,500
[SPEAKER_02]: This is certainly something that I have no problem approving this evening or voting in favor of this evening.

178
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd move for approval.

179
00:15:43,762 --> 00:15:46,765
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion for approval, chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

180
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:48,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Del Rosso.

181
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:52,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Kearns, for coming and bringing us all the information.

182
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,791
[SPEAKER_13]: The $165,000 from FEMA, can you remind me what the total

183
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:01,955
[SPEAKER_13]: reimbursement to Medford is?

184
00:16:04,236 --> 00:16:20,520
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as snow-related removal, the snow on the roofs plus also the snow removal from traffic intersections and the hauling of the snow in the city that had taken place at the time, that came out to be $431,489.46 total.

185
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:28,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Reimbursement to the city?

186
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:30,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Reimbursement to the city.

187
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,577
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the exact figure, Madam Vice President.

188
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:43,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a separate appropriation due to it being structures for the house at the cemetery and also the maintenance garage.

189
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,384
[SPEAKER_07]: That was going to be $174,649.83 once it's approved and sent by FEMA.

190
00:16:56,506 --> 00:17:02,168
[SPEAKER_13]: So this $165,000 is the first payment of approximately $600,000?

191
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:02,249
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

192
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:04,530
[SPEAKER_07]: The first payment that has been received already is $287,179, Madam Vice President.

193
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,690
[SPEAKER_07]: So this $165,000 then is the second payment?

194
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:05,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

195
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:05,910
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

196
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,351
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you could just remind us,

197
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:29,151
[SPEAKER_13]: that we had appropriated for stump removal and sidewalk replacement.

198
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:35,555
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe we were going to try to get a majority of our stumps removed from this outline you gave us.

199
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:42,039
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like 26 have been done within the last few months.

200
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:45,702
[SPEAKER_07]: That was done by our in-house forces, Madam Vice President.

201
00:17:46,462 --> 00:17:51,486
[SPEAKER_07]: The approach that we're going to try to attempt here is really a two-pronged attack.

202
00:17:51,926 --> 00:17:53,347
[SPEAKER_07]: We will have the contract

203
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:03,968
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the contract, the language with my Casey and sons, as far as the removal of tree stumps and the restoration of the sidewalks that were compromised.

204
00:18:04,508 --> 00:18:23,923
[SPEAKER_07]: But in addition to that, all right, this would be just strictly a stump grinding contract that would take place that would go throughout the city in areas that the sidewalks are not on the list to be repaired due to a tree that may have fallen down from a storm or motor vehicle accident.

205
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:30,233
[SPEAKER_07]: or quite honestly fatigue, but the sidewalks presently are not compromised.

206
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:33,534
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would be just simply grinding them out in place.

207
00:18:34,074 --> 00:18:43,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if a tree was requested by that homeowner, we would be going in there once the city average gave the go ahead to plant a new tree.

208
00:18:44,377 --> 00:18:45,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

209
00:18:45,517 --> 00:18:45,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

210
00:18:45,897 --> 00:18:47,777
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you, can you tell us then where we're at with the 500,000?

211
00:18:47,817 --> 00:18:47,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

212
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:57,217
[SPEAKER_07]: right now where we did not, the department of public works did not have enough money to cover the low bid, the low bid being 543,000.

213
00:18:57,577 --> 00:19:06,944
[SPEAKER_07]: We're able to move around some of our existing money within public works, but we were still shot the 14,000.

214
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:08,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

215
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,407
[SPEAKER_07]: To come up to the grand total.

216
00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:15,110
[SPEAKER_07]: If approved, then, uh, purchasing, okay.

217
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Would release,

218
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:29,145
[SPEAKER_07]: and award the contract to Marchese, who has already, you know, been alerted by the city that, you know, something could happen depending on the approval of the Council.

219
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:33,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, he'd start as soon as he got the word.

220
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:36,308
[SPEAKER_13]: So we haven't even started to expend the $500,000?

221
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,549
[SPEAKER_13]: No, as of this moment, no.

222
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,431
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would explain why only $26,000 had been removed for the $281,000?

223
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:42,551
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

224
00:19:42,671 --> 00:19:43,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so we're going to start.

225
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:50,734
[SPEAKER_13]: If that process takes place, contract awarded, are we talking the spring then, that would be spent?

226
00:19:51,275 --> 00:20:00,519
[SPEAKER_07]: No, my approach right now is we probably have maybe three weeks left as far as concrete is concerned.

227
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Asphalt, okay, we can push the envelope right through the end of November.

228
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:15,026
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I would like to do, sitting with the engineers, assess the list and do the sidewalks that would be replaced with asphalt.

229
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:25,870
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the concrete is concerned, that is going to be a weather permitting, but come the beginning of November, you know, we don't want to, you know, compromise, you know, any kind of work that would involve concrete.

230
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,973
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we would, you know, put a moratorium on until the beginning of April.

231
00:20:31,894 --> 00:20:32,135
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

232
00:20:33,255 --> 00:20:34,256
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that covers everything.

233
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,859
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the delay in the awarding the contract was?

234
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

235
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite honestly, the low bidder, you know, we appropriated the 500,000.

236
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:48,887
[SPEAKER_07]: but the low bidder, uh, it was my Casey and he came in at 543,000.

237
00:20:49,907 --> 00:20:54,989
[SPEAKER_07]: So in order to, to move forward, we have to work, you know, cover the balance.

238
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

239
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:02,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, madam vice president chair recognizes council marks.

240
00:21:04,093 --> 00:21:04,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

241
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:09,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thank the DPW commissioner, Mr. Karen's for coming before us tonight.

242
00:21:10,055 --> 00:21:10,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

243
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:29,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I gotta say I'm a little disappointed because it was several months ago that, uh, the mayor requested from this body that we appropriate $500,000 for the immediate repair of sidewalks and tree stump removal.

244
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:33,345
[SPEAKER_14]: And when did that happen, Brian?

245
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:37,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, that happened, uh, you know, obviously prior to, uh, beginning of the fiscal year.

246
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:40,066
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe in sometime early June.

247
00:21:40,146 --> 00:21:43,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't have the date counselor in front of me.

248
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:49,393
[SPEAKER_14]: So, so early June, uh, we were told as a body that we needed this money immediately.

249
00:21:49,453 --> 00:22:04,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause I remember some members of the council and you probably remember the night, uh, wanted to get a little more involved with what exactly we were going to do for this 500,000, which sidewalks were going to be replaced, how many sidewalks, how many stumps.

250
00:22:04,966 --> 00:22:06,427
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were told at the time,

251
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:11,712
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, if you let this go on another week, uh, it's going to be a week longer before we get to the sidewalks.

252
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:21,795
[SPEAKER_14]: And here we are in October and, uh, I'm dumbfounded that the city would come before us for a half a million dollars.

253
00:22:22,635 --> 00:22:29,477
[SPEAKER_14]: And you must have had a plan saying we want to accomplish this many sidewalks and this many stumps.

254
00:22:30,777 --> 00:22:32,838
[SPEAKER_14]: And then for the low bidder to come back at 543,000,

255
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:41,074
[SPEAKER_14]: $43,000 above what the city was requesting either tells me one or two things.

256
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:50,616
[SPEAKER_14]: That your list was unrealistic, meaning the amount of money you were looking for for the type of work you wanted done could never be accomplished.

257
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:52,676
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's one thing.

258
00:22:53,156 --> 00:23:03,239
[SPEAKER_14]: And the second thing is that I'd like to see, and I don't know if you have a copy with you, but when we originally asked for a listing of what was going to be done,

259
00:23:03,824 --> 00:23:19,212
[SPEAKER_14]: and I remember specifically asking you about what was the cost per panel, and you gave us a cost, I think it was kind of on a low end of it, we figured out afterwards, but I don't understand where the miscommunication is.

260
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:29,677
[SPEAKER_14]: If you presented a list or a request for proposal, whatever went out to the bidders, and it said we want what?

261
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:31,318
[SPEAKER_14]: How many sidewalks done?

262
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that how it went out?

263
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:33,718
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking for?

264
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:34,398
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

265
00:23:34,898 --> 00:23:35,979
[SPEAKER_14]: And how many were asked?

266
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,999
[SPEAKER_14]: How many panels were asked?

267
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:37,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

268
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have that information, you know, in front of me or council.

269
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:53,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't prepared, uh, uh, for it, but, uh, you know, going, uh, over the entire package with our engineers, as far as, you know, what the industry standards were, you know, for the most part, uh, you know, what we've found.

270
00:23:53,447 --> 00:24:01,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was something that I was concerned right from day one is where the economy in a very good way,

271
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:03,333
[SPEAKER_07]: is very good, very strong.

272
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:14,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Contractors, just no different than Leo's landscaping, are coming in with these prices that are far beyond our expectations.

273
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:24,417
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if this was a few years ago, when the economy was a little tighter, I think that, you know, a lot of these contractors would have tightened their belt a little bit more.

274
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:29,338
[SPEAKER_07]: The second thing is, obviously, that we're all privy to,

275
00:24:29,979 --> 00:24:33,441
[SPEAKER_07]: was the fact that our budget director had left.

276
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:45,869
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result, of course, of the budget director leaving, you know, everything was sort of going then at a much slower pace till, you know, the permanent appointment was made.

277
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:59,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And when the permanent appointment was made by the mayor, then it was, you know, like, you know, bees to honey, where, you know, she was inundated with all kinds of paperwork, you know, to process different, you know,

278
00:24:59,637 --> 00:25:04,740
[SPEAKER_07]: purchase orders, bids, awards, whatever was left there.

279
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:14,747
[SPEAKER_07]: And it unfortunately took her a little time to get up to speed and get caught up with everything that was continuing to be generated after Ms.

280
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:15,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Miller left.

281
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:26,895
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that, and I can appreciate that, because I know for a period of time the city did not have a purchasing agent, and that was a problem.

282
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:46,171
[SPEAKER_14]: But on the flip side, if the bid went out and the lowest bid came back at $543,000, why as a city couldn't you go back to the drawing table and say, you know what, rather than doing 300 panels and 40 stumps, do 270 panels and 36 stumps?

283
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:52,633
[SPEAKER_07]: That could have been an option, Councillor, but our first approach was

284
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:58,493
[SPEAKER_07]: where it had taken so long just to get that far and get it out on the streets.

285
00:25:58,513 --> 00:25:59,995
[SPEAKER_07]: But we know why it took so long.

286
00:26:00,896 --> 00:26:03,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Because we didn't have someone in the office.

287
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:04,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, exactly.

288
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,125
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to make an attempt to see internally within our budget

289
00:26:10,512 --> 00:26:30,647
[SPEAKER_07]: if we could just cover the balance that was needed to move it ahead rather than start to reinvent the wheel and put it back out to bid again, which would have taken several more weeks delay before we even knew if there was going to be any bidders that were going to be low enough at the time.

290
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:37,012
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's fair to say, as you just mentioned, we have about a three week window to pour cement.

291
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:42,478
[SPEAKER_14]: It's fair to say, I don't think we're going to be pouring much cement within that three-week window.

292
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:44,038
[SPEAKER_07]: No, and you're absolutely right.

293
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:48,739
[SPEAKER_07]: But we can continue to do asphalt.

294
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:55,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Asphalt, all right, we can continue to do, unless we get into these flash freezes.

295
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:05,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And on the breakdown that I've given all the members of the council here, it broke it down as far as what was concrete and what was asphalt.

296
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:18,222
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could continue, all right, the asphalt portion of it, all right, up to a point, and then obviously, depending on the, you know, how the weather is, you know, we just may have to cease operations till springtime.

297
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:23,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so that leads to my other point then.

298
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:31,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Year after year since I've been on the council, and it's been a number of years, we run a deficit in the snow and ice.

299
00:27:32,166 --> 00:27:33,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you can almost bet on it.

300
00:27:34,665 --> 00:27:39,128
[SPEAKER_14]: that our budget does not match what we spend for snow and ice removal every year.

301
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:51,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, here we have some money coming back based on a particular storm that we received some funding for, and we're taking the money from snow and ice that we know that account is going to go into a deficit.

302
00:27:53,858 --> 00:28:01,023
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet you right now that that account will be in a deficit, and we're spending it on catch basins, which we need.

303
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:01,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that.

304
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:03,485
[SPEAKER_14]: We're spending it on sidewalks.

305
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:07,397
[SPEAKER_14]: We're spending on other tree planters and so forth.

306
00:28:07,997 --> 00:28:18,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Why wouldn't we, as a city, saying, knowing the history of this community, not funding fully the budget for snow and ice, why wouldn't we take that money and put it back in snow and ice?

307
00:28:20,883 --> 00:28:27,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the question I have is, what if we have a winter like we had this year, and there would be a surplus?

308
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:30,748
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a risk that we take.

309
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,569
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been around a lot of years, too.

310
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:36,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was the first time I've ever seen a surplus.

311
00:28:36,295 --> 00:28:41,999
[SPEAKER_14]: So, in the 15 years I've been on the council, one year there was a surplus, 14 years we were in deficit.

312
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,202
[SPEAKER_14]: If I was a betting man, I'd say we're probably going to be in deficit.

313
00:28:45,982 --> 00:28:48,004
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've been in New England a long time, as well as you.

314
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:51,006
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, the mild winters are few and far between.

315
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:53,748
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I don't know.

316
00:28:54,088 --> 00:28:57,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I just, you know, I'm having deja vu again.

317
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:00,333
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm having deja vu with the sidewalks.

318
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,775
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you request a half a million dollars,

319
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:05,114
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've asked the administration.

320
00:29:05,174 --> 00:29:07,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I talked to the mayor a couple of weeks ago when she called me on something.

321
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,036
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the first thing I asked.

322
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:12,358
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, how many sidewalks and stumps have been done with the 500,000?

323
00:29:12,638 --> 00:29:16,520
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, we are in the process of awarding the bid.

324
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,701
[SPEAKER_14]: This is months after the fact.

325
00:29:19,181 --> 00:29:23,183
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're coming back before the council saying, give us a little more money.

326
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,444
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a lot, but give us a little more money.

327
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:29,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I really have a problem with that.

328
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:30,107
[SPEAKER_14]: I really do.

329
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,448
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd rather see this go back out to bid.

330
00:29:33,178 --> 00:29:37,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Or I'd rather see you sit down with the low bidder and say, you know what?

331
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:38,743
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if you can do that.

332
00:29:38,783 --> 00:29:40,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it has to go back out to bid.

333
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:46,931
[SPEAKER_14]: But sit down with the low bidder and say, give us $500,000 worth of sidewalks and stump removal.

334
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:49,473
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I'd rather see done.

335
00:29:50,815 --> 00:29:53,857
[SPEAKER_14]: The second piece you mentioned about catch basins.

336
00:29:54,198 --> 00:29:56,160
[SPEAKER_14]: You mentioned there are 4,500 catch basins.

337
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you remember a couple of months ago,

338
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:02,538
[SPEAKER_14]: I said you can go down any street and see a sunken catch basin.

339
00:30:02,578 --> 00:30:03,118
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

340
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:04,839
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how bad it's getting in this community.

341
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:17,927
[SPEAKER_14]: You provided a list to us which seems to be probably calls that were made to the mayor's office within the last year or so requesting a catch basin on the street.

342
00:30:18,868 --> 00:30:22,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have a full list of catch basins that need repair?

343
00:30:22,618 --> 00:30:22,838
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

344
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:23,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

345
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:30,961
[SPEAKER_07]: The, the highway and the highway department is, has been compiling ongoing as they see, you know, a base and they make a, you know, notation of it.

346
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:48,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I mean right now I think, you know, total combined, we're probably all right, you know, like 40, 45 basins that, you know, have been visually seen and verified out there that needs some form of rebuilding, maybe not total restoration, but some in addition to this list that was provided today.

347
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,327
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it'd be total.

348
00:30:49,687 --> 00:30:50,308
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be total.

349
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Total counselor.

350
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:51,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

351
00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:57,637
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, and I realize you just started doing that check throughout the city.

352
00:30:58,878 --> 00:30:59,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

353
00:30:59,478 --> 00:31:00,918
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the basins are concerned.

354
00:31:00,938 --> 00:31:01,038
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

355
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:01,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

356
00:31:01,699 --> 00:31:12,283
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this is something that started up once we get into, uh, you know, springtime, um, you know, obviously we were receiving calls from people, but then, uh, you know, once, uh, the weather broke,

357
00:31:13,432 --> 00:31:19,135
[SPEAKER_07]: We had the big sweep, and a lot of the basins then were exposed, you know, from the leaves and everything.

358
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:27,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And the debris from the winter, we were able to actually physically see the basins out there and how many were actually, you know, collapsing or on the verge of collapsing.

359
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

360
00:31:29,861 --> 00:31:40,467
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you were going to give an estimate of how many catch basins need some type of repair, and I realize it could vary from 1,500 to 5,000, what would be your thought out of the 4,500?

361
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,941
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, again, Council, it's hard to say.

362
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:50,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you're talking a catch basin, all right, that is below street grade, you know, one inch.

363
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:55,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you're talking every basin in New England, all right?

364
00:31:55,205 --> 00:32:00,347
[SPEAKER_07]: They all vary, all right, as far as, you know, the street grade is concerned and the pitch of them.

365
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:01,608
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not supposed to be pitched.

366
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,028
[SPEAKER_07]: They're supposed to be level with the street.

367
00:32:03,468 --> 00:32:07,170
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as them actually being flush is concerned, all right, you know,

368
00:32:08,397 --> 00:32:09,138
[SPEAKER_07]: it's hard to guess.

369
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:12,540
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, but I'm not talking about being flush.

370
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,183
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, our streets are riddled with potholes, our sidewalks are cracked.

371
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:21,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm talking about catch basins that when you look at, you say, wow, that catch basin is sinking.

372
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:24,689
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the average person looking at it could spot it out.

373
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:28,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Not talking about a lip between the street and the catch basin.

374
00:32:29,373 --> 00:32:30,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Roughly, what do you think we have?

375
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:30,513
10%?

376
00:32:30,673 --> 00:32:31,174
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, at the most.

377
00:32:33,642 --> 00:32:38,625
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're looking at probably 450 catch basins that need some type of repair?

378
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:47,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Some type of repair, or by spring, possibly, depending on the winter, could accelerate the process and deterioration.

379
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:50,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So do we have a listing of these catch basins?

380
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:58,257
[SPEAKER_07]: The list that I provided you was the list that came into the DPW office.

381
00:32:58,757 --> 00:32:59,678
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition to that,

382
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:10,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Our engineering division and our highway department have been compiling a list as they go along, making a notation, compiling the list of basins that need some form of attention.

383
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:11,407
[SPEAKER_14]: So when will this list be done?

384
00:33:12,027 --> 00:33:12,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me?

385
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,409
[SPEAKER_07]: When will this list be done, finalized?

386
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:16,769
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll never be done.

387
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:18,990
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be an ongoing list.

388
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:25,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I could give you everything up to today, but by the end of the week,

389
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,641
[SPEAKER_07]: two or three more may have been already entered into it.

390
00:33:28,701 --> 00:33:29,462
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to say.

391
00:33:29,502 --> 00:33:34,344
[SPEAKER_14]: So, so, so we have a private contractor that's going around currently cleaning the catch basins.

392
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,105
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

393
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:52,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Why, why wouldn't we ask the private contractor as part of cleaning the basins to also provide us a list because they do this for a living, provide us a list of catch basins that currently is sinking and that needs some type of interaction.

394
00:33:53,795 --> 00:34:09,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Why wouldn't we take that step, even if it was an additional cost, why wouldn't we take that step to at least point out in the community, because I really believe we're at a real, real point of concern here with these catch basins.

395
00:34:10,561 --> 00:34:23,365
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, if you want to talk about flooding in the community like we had in the Lawrence Estates and so forth, don't attend to your catch basins, and then you're really going to see some major flooding and flooding of basements throughout the city.

396
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,091
[SPEAKER_14]: And people are going to be irate.

397
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:32,014
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we're at a point right now where many of our catch basins are going to collapse onto themselves.

398
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:33,794
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's going to be a concern.

399
00:34:34,194 --> 00:34:36,095
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to be a real major concern in this city.

400
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:37,575
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think we're addressing it.

401
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:38,836
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not pointing the finger at you.

402
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:40,476
[SPEAKER_14]: You've been here a short period of time.

403
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:41,817
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're not addressing it.

404
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:45,338
[SPEAKER_14]: We have no list that we can look at, right?

405
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:46,798
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't show me a list.

406
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:48,159
[SPEAKER_14]: It's being compiled.

407
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:52,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I realize that it's a work in progress, but at some point,

408
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:57,668
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is not the, we're not talking to the City of New York here.

409
00:34:57,708 --> 00:34:58,848
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking to the City of Meffitt.

410
00:34:58,868 --> 00:35:07,271
[SPEAKER_14]: At some point, we should be able to get a number, a good number of catch basins that need to be attended to and what the cost is going to be.

411
00:35:08,091 --> 00:35:11,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we're being presented with piecemeal.

412
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:12,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, here's 25.

413
00:35:12,572 --> 00:35:15,053
[SPEAKER_14]: We may or may not get to them.

414
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:16,973
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what it is.

415
00:35:17,374 --> 00:35:18,534
[SPEAKER_14]: We may or may not get to these.

416
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:22,435
[SPEAKER_07]: If the money was appropriated,

417
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:24,616
[SPEAKER_07]: A bid would go out right away.

418
00:35:25,476 --> 00:35:33,563
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the cost is concerned, every basin that needs attention, their condition is different.

419
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Some may have steel plates on them.

420
00:35:36,265 --> 00:35:37,046
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all seen that.

421
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:40,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have others that may have a slight pitch.

422
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,934
[SPEAKER_07]: We go by what the industry standards are as far as costs are concerned.

423
00:35:47,514 --> 00:35:50,697
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, the cost could be as low as the $1,500

424
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:58,944
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would just be simple, reset the cover, the ring, some barrel block cement, we move on.

425
00:35:59,644 --> 00:36:11,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it could be full five feet, rebuilding the actual walls and coming up, and also a new cover and ring, which would be in the vicinity of $5,000.

426
00:36:13,113 --> 00:36:18,297
[SPEAKER_07]: So each one is going to vary as far as the condition and also the cost.

427
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,421
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's a really simple case of going by industry standards.

428
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:31,165
[SPEAKER_14]: So why wouldn't we take advantage of some of the surplus money in the water and sewer accounts, the $8 million that we have in water and sewer?

429
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:39,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Why wouldn't we be looking at some of this funding to start replacing catch basins and doing some of the work we'd need throughout the community?

430
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:42,610
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a mayoral decision.

431
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:47,732
[SPEAKER_14]: I realize that, but I think as long as this council,

432
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:54,500
[SPEAKER_14]: keeps approving anything that's presented to us, I think we're going to be faced with this piecemeal approach.

433
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:57,842
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, Brian, this is not directed at you.

434
00:36:59,103 --> 00:37:02,525
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just tired of a piecemeal approach to everything.

435
00:37:03,226 --> 00:37:06,268
[SPEAKER_14]: And that seems to be, again, what we're facing here tonight.

436
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:15,655
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, as one member, am not going to support this tonight because I think, as I stated last week when we were talking about

437
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:25,103
[SPEAKER_14]: the capital plan that we wanted for this community and the mayor presented the Plan for City Hall here with nothing else.

438
00:37:25,563 --> 00:37:45,289
[SPEAKER_14]: It was this council that stood up and said madam mayor We want the capital plan before we move forward and sure enough the committee the whole meeting last Wednesday the mayor presented her draft capital plan and You know again, I would ask my colleagues that we either

439
00:37:46,482 --> 00:37:47,382
[SPEAKER_14]: table this tonight.

440
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:49,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there might be some questions.

441
00:37:49,783 --> 00:37:52,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just throwing this out there that we table this tonight.

442
00:37:52,964 --> 00:37:57,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, so we can have a full discussion with the mayor because Brian's great.

443
00:37:57,866 --> 00:38:01,107
[SPEAKER_14]: He's doing yeoman's work, but I want to know the direction we're going in.

444
00:38:01,868 --> 00:38:10,771
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think doing piecemeal, uh, 24 catch basins here, a few sidewalks here, uh, is adequate enough for our community.

445
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:13,372
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe when we talk about capital planning,

446
00:38:14,744 --> 00:38:16,865
[SPEAKER_14]: that that should be mixed in with the capital planning.

447
00:38:17,245 --> 00:38:20,207
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the five-year plan for our streets?

448
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:20,927
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the five?

449
00:38:21,147 --> 00:38:22,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight brought this up.

450
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:26,150
[SPEAKER_14]: He brought up about x-raying our streets so we can get on top of things.

451
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,372
[SPEAKER_14]: And here we are tonight, really, with a Band-Aid.

452
00:38:29,532 --> 00:38:30,912
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a Band-Aid.

453
00:38:31,553 --> 00:38:34,474
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know what happens when you pull off a Band-Aid?

454
00:38:34,995 --> 00:38:35,635
[SPEAKER_14]: You get an ouch.

455
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've received a lot of ouches in the last couple of years.

456
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:43,399
[SPEAKER_14]: And, Mr. President, I would respectfully ask

457
00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:48,789
[SPEAKER_14]: that this be sent to a committee of the whole meeting where we can invite the mayor.

458
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:54,871
[SPEAKER_14]: It was great to have the mayor here last week to discuss some of the issues going on in this community.

459
00:38:55,552 --> 00:39:11,717
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we can address the catch basins, the sidewalks, tree stumps, signage, whatever else you want to address as either part of the capital plan, either part of the surplus money we have in the water and sewer account over $8 million

460
00:39:14,456 --> 00:39:18,439
[SPEAKER_14]: of ratepayer money sitting there for these type of projects.

461
00:39:18,959 --> 00:39:21,761
[SPEAKER_14]: That money's there for infrastructure improvements.

462
00:39:23,582 --> 00:39:27,424
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not there for a barn rating so they can say, oh, look at our barn rating.

463
00:39:27,665 --> 00:39:31,287
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a great barn rating because we have all the surplus money lying around.

464
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:34,309
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's for infrastructure improvements in the community.

465
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:42,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that this be sent to a committee of the whole meeting for a further review.

466
00:39:43,257 --> 00:39:44,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thank Mr. Kearns.

467
00:39:45,058 --> 00:39:45,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, counselor.

468
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:47,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a request or a motion counselor?

469
00:39:47,958 --> 00:40:01,942
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd put in the form of a motion, Mr. President on the motion of approval by counselor night with a second motion, which we'll have to take as a separate item, a B paper.

470
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:05,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, uh, that would have to be a B paper.

471
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:09,765
[SPEAKER_04]: No, uh, no, it's the contrary motions.

472
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:11,425
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a motion for approval of the matter.

473
00:40:11,897 --> 00:40:18,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a secondary motion now introduced on the floor that this paper be sent to Committee of the Whole.

474
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:21,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was no motion to table.

475
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:22,984
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't motion to table.

476
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:25,265
[SPEAKER_14]: I was trying to be magnanimous.

477
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:31,830
[SPEAKER_14]: But apparently, if you want to make that a B paper, I will have to draw a motion to table.

478
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:37,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a contradictory motion to the motion that's already been introduced, Counselor.

479
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:39,655
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your opinion.

480
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:43,467
[SPEAKER_14]: It's your opinion.

481
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:53,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever, whatever you want to do, I, you know, I'll, I'll, I don't know if it's a matter of opinion, if it was stating two different things.

482
00:40:54,497 --> 00:40:55,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, thank you.

483
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:55,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor.

484
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:56,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Scott Pelley.

485
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:58,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

486
00:40:58,961 --> 00:40:59,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Carnes.

487
00:41:00,122 --> 00:41:09,891
[SPEAKER_06]: A few questions I have brought up from a few residents just a week ago is, um, the type of tree that,

488
00:41:10,577 --> 00:41:20,940
[SPEAKER_06]: has been used in, in, in newer, um, street repairs and sidewalk repairs ended up having the same type of routing system that are now bringing up their sidewalks.

489
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:24,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you, are you familiar what kind of trees we're using?

490
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:26,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, okay.

491
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:32,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the list, uh, but I don't have it with me as far as the different species of trees that are available.

492
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:36,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, uh, you know, the ones that the arborist chooses.

493
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:36,785
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

494
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:39,746
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important that we really stress that to the arborist,

495
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:54,565
[SPEAKER_06]: because what's happening in some of the neighborhoods that have newer sidewalks, they're now starting to lift because of the old, um, what was, was told in the past, we're using a new pear tree, for instance, that the rooting system is different.

496
00:41:54,605 --> 00:42:06,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So now, uh, I think it's important that as we think forward and, and with the arborist that we're not, we're not putting ourselves in the same position we are in, in 15 years after we have this, that,

497
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:10,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we have brand new sidewalks that are popping up and replacing those.

498
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:15,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that if we can just make sure that we have that answer for us.

499
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:31,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's something that I offered as an idea and as the acting commissioner of DPW, other communities have actual sidewalk repair teams.

500
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:36,909
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that I looked into a little bit of what we do every year and a year to year.

501
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:38,031
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, fix.

502
00:42:38,071 --> 00:42:45,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something that you would entertain as our commissioner looking to bring in a few staff people with the equipment needed?

503
00:42:46,038 --> 00:42:47,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have these issues.

504
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:54,825
[SPEAKER_06]: I know one of the issues that why this wasn't moved forward from what I was told was that the bid, the bid wasn't, it was out there for a while.

505
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:57,327
[SPEAKER_06]: People weren't actually fighting on that bid.

506
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,509
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why it took a little bit more time.

507
00:42:59,529 --> 00:43:05,474
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, we, we investigated the idea of maybe bringing in our own sidewalk crew that

508
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:06,622
[SPEAKER_06]: eliminates that?

509
00:43:06,702 --> 00:43:07,622
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is it something that.

510
00:43:08,443 --> 00:43:14,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, our, our existing highway department, um, you know, I, I'll match them up to anybody's salary department.

511
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:15,648
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't disagree with you.

512
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:17,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're great, but is that enough?

513
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:22,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, in, in public works as a whole, I mean, the men and women do monumental work.

514
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:24,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with you a thousand percent.

515
00:43:24,115 --> 00:43:28,718
[SPEAKER_07]: The highway department would be the actual ones that would do, uh, the masonry work, right?

516
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,159
[SPEAKER_07]: They do perform it.

517
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's unfortunately on a very limited basis because the, you know, they're,

518
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:43,953
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, responsibilities are very broad in general throughout the city, whether it be, you know, striping potholes, um, the litter baskets.

519
00:43:43,973 --> 00:43:48,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the, the list is endless as far as what the, you know, daily duties are.

520
00:43:48,614 --> 00:44:02,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, there was, you know, times that we were able to take on additional, uh, responsibilities like repairing a few sidewalk panels here or there, or rebuilding our, uh, uh, you know, uh, uh, ADA ramp,

521
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:05,645
[SPEAKER_07]: somewhere or a couple of panels in front of a store.

522
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:14,751
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as, you know, being, uh, you know, taking on, um, the responsibility of, you know, a large scale contract, it'd be virtually impossible.

523
00:44:14,771 --> 00:44:14,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

524
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:16,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, we'll get to the same point.

525
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:20,655
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that our DPW staff and highway staff, they're amazing.

526
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:29,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for what they're trying to do with the number of people that we have working, have we, would it help if we made a motion to, to ask the mayor to look into, um,

527
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:40,150
[SPEAKER_06]: The hiring of more DPW workers for that alone, you know, the highway for sidewalk repair and catch basins.

528
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:50,474
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's something we can do in-house, but if we look to hire and put that in place, would that be, you know, wish list is, you know, I'm asking.

529
00:44:51,434 --> 00:44:52,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, absolutely.

530
00:44:52,695 --> 00:44:56,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd never refuse additional staffing in any area of public works.

531
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:00,578
[SPEAKER_07]: But it certainly would, you know, accomplish things and

532
00:45:00,959 --> 00:45:09,824
[SPEAKER_07]: the same time too, you could, you know, continue a program probably, you know, maybe nine months of a year, you know, of course, weather permitting.

533
00:45:10,465 --> 00:45:15,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I mean, you were able, you'd be able to manage and maintain, um, you know, the constant workflow.

534
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:30,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we can, I don't know if we can make a motion to the mayor to look into, you know, the, the practice of maybe looking into our own, um, sidewalk crew and, and, and future hiring.

535
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:33,253
[SPEAKER_06]: through DPW and the highway department.

536
00:45:33,613 --> 00:45:39,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So would you like to make that an amendment to the actual motion on the floor or the contradictory motion on the floor?

537
00:45:42,036 --> 00:45:43,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go with both.

538
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:47,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Whichever one passes, that's the motion for approval.

539
00:45:48,098 --> 00:46:00,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Be it amended by Councilor Scott Pelley, that the mayor be requested to add additional staffing to the Department of Public Works for the purpose of sidewalk repair and assessment.

540
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:02,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

541
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello.

542
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,560
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

543
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:07,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli mentioned pretty much exactly what I was going to mention.

544
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:19,349
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if we had a sidewalk department, it would be, like you said, a nine-month-a-year job because there's, I mean, you'll never ever stop fixing sidewalks.

545
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:20,750
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

546
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:29,976
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I mean, for us to keep coming up every year asking for more money and asking for more money and more money, it's just, it seems like we're wasting money.

547
00:46:30,696 --> 00:46:36,219
[SPEAKER_11]: rather than putting, I mean, how many crew would it take to actually put on a sidewalk department?

548
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:48,266
[SPEAKER_07]: You would need a supervisor, a heavy equipment operator, and two, or ideally three, men that would be the refinishes.

549
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:49,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, half a dozen men would do it?

550
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:53,249
[SPEAKER_07]: At the most, yeah, if you want to focus in on that subject.

551
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:54,289
[SPEAKER_11]: We're spending $550,000 to give to another company.

552
00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:55,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd rather hire our own men.

553
00:47:00,224 --> 00:47:07,227
[SPEAKER_11]: and have a department that we know is gonna be there next year, and they'll just constantly, that'll be their job, is fixing sidewalks, and they do nothing else.

554
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:16,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just foolish to keep wasting money, and every year we're gonna come up, we're gonna fight every year, we need more money, I think it'll make your job a lot easier.

555
00:47:16,552 --> 00:47:19,413
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're not even talking about the manual covers.

556
00:47:20,394 --> 00:47:25,256
[SPEAKER_11]: You haven't even gone into those, and I would think those are just as bad as the catch basins.

557
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:28,778
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree with Councilor Moxley, I think,

558
00:47:29,327 --> 00:47:36,532
[SPEAKER_11]: We have all that money that I don't understand why that's not being used for this.

559
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:41,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, that should be a department just doing that on its own.

560
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:42,756
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree with that.

561
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:43,196
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand.

562
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not saying it's your fault.

563
00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:48,480
[SPEAKER_11]: And the guys that we have are way overworked.

564
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:51,262
[SPEAKER_11]: They do more than their share of work.

565
00:47:51,782 --> 00:47:52,963
[SPEAKER_11]: But extremely talented.

566
00:47:53,263 --> 00:47:54,064
[SPEAKER_11]: They're very good guys.

567
00:47:54,124 --> 00:47:55,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got another thing.

568
00:47:59,695 --> 00:48:04,238
[SPEAKER_11]: When you take out the stumps, we leave a hole there in the ground.

569
00:48:06,179 --> 00:48:12,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I drive up and down the streets all the time, and I see these places where trees used to be, and they're all overgrown.

570
00:48:14,623 --> 00:48:17,405
[SPEAKER_11]: And I talk about how our city lacks curb appeal.

571
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:19,866
[SPEAKER_11]: That's one of the things that irks me.

572
00:48:19,886 --> 00:48:24,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Every day I drive up and down, and I see bushes growing right on the main streets.

573
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,990
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna give you, for instance, where I live,

574
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:34,168
[SPEAKER_11]: on the corner of Woobin and High, the bus stop, that whole, I don't know how people even get on the bus anymore.

575
00:48:34,228 --> 00:48:40,532
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the weed's gonna be three feet high for about an eight or maybe a 10-foot stretch.

576
00:48:41,973 --> 00:48:47,417
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I don't know why somebody couldn't go by with a weed whacker and just knock them down.

577
00:48:47,997 --> 00:48:48,418
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, again.

578
00:48:48,778 --> 00:48:50,179
[SPEAKER_11]: You'd be taking care of a counselor.

579
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not blaming you again.

580
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, it goes to lack of personnel that you don't have.

581
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:58,525
[SPEAKER_11]: There should be people that just go around doing that.

582
00:48:58,545 --> 00:49:06,070
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, let's say you drive up and down and you see that you see all the, you know, the, you see overgrowth everywhere and you can only do so much with what you get.

583
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:13,974
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, and I agree with council Scott, probably we shouldn't be requesting, we should be demanding that you get more people to work.

584
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:16,396
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.

585
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:16,816
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

586
00:49:17,536 --> 00:49:17,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

587
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:18,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Counsel.

588
00:49:19,017 --> 00:49:19,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Falco.

589
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:20,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

590
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:24,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, and I'd like to thank a DPW commissioner Karen's for being here tonight.

591
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:26,256
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank you for the report.

592
00:49:26,276 --> 00:49:27,097
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very thorough.

593
00:49:27,137 --> 00:49:30,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And I like to see how progress has been made.

594
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:35,083
[SPEAKER_10]: And you show that on the report by giving us the dates as to when stumps have been removed and whatnot.

595
00:49:35,943 --> 00:49:49,193
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd also like to state that I do support Councilor Scott Pelly and his motion that, you know, it'd be nice to see all this labor being done in house and seeing it done by our DPW department.

596
00:49:49,233 --> 00:49:53,897
[SPEAKER_10]: I do agree that our DPW department is significantly understaffed.

597
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,042
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really believe we need more staffing and we need, I'd like to see more money.

598
00:49:59,842 --> 00:50:02,963
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope the mayor puts more money towards that in the upcoming budget.

599
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:07,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so I do support the, the more in-house personnel.

600
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:15,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, but one of the things that I wanted to, uh, that I'd like to amend the resolution is I'd like to see, I like the report tonight that shows the progress of what's been done.

601
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:23,610
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like if we could, if I could amend the resolution to actually, if we could get a report each month when this work begins to actually get,

602
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:35,377
[SPEAKER_10]: report back showing us the progress, what's being done, you know, when stumps are being removed, you know, what the addresses are, when sidewalk panels are going in, what the addresses are, because this is a significant amount of money.

603
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:36,898
[SPEAKER_10]: You're talking about a half a million dollars.

604
00:50:37,478 --> 00:50:39,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know, when we should see how it's being spent.

605
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:48,287
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to see a reporting each month, uh, you know, basically updated list, just a check Mark that shows these addresses, these stumps have been removed.

606
00:50:48,807 --> 00:50:52,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, these sidewalk panels have been replaced because I know we all get calls.

607
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,932
[SPEAKER_10]: on a fairly regular basis about stumps, sidewalks, catch basins, flooding, all that type of thing.

608
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:07,335
[SPEAKER_10]: So for the amount of money that's being spent, I'd like to see that as an amendment to the resolution that we get that regular reporting.

609
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:12,417
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you very much for your report, and thank you for the hard work that you put in in your department as well.

610
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:12,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

611
00:51:12,777 --> 00:51:13,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

612
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:22,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So as amended by Councilor Falco on the motion for approval that the City Council receive monthly updates on the progress

613
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:23,872
[SPEAKER_04]: of said projects.

614
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:27,954
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have before us, Madam Vice President.

615
00:51:27,974 --> 00:51:34,917
[SPEAKER_13]: Just briefly, just on, I think that's a great idea, Councilor Falco, and maybe take it one step further and putting it online so the residents can see it.

616
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:47,984
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can let the residents go online and be able to look at the list and what's been removed and what's coming up, it's almost like the C-Click fix, except advance notice, and it'd be definitely helpful.

617
00:51:50,325 --> 00:51:52,086
[SPEAKER_04]: As amended by Vice President Longo-Khan.

618
00:51:53,616 --> 00:51:58,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have before us a conundrum for me in that we have two motions.

619
00:51:59,361 --> 00:52:08,330
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one, the first motion introduced, which was a motion for approval, and that has been amended.

620
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:13,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have the contradictory motion, which is introduced that this be sent

621
00:52:14,346 --> 00:52:17,329
[SPEAKER_04]: to the committee of the whole for meeting with the member.

622
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:26,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the mayor, so on the procedure would be then to take the second one as a secondary motion.

623
00:52:27,379 --> 00:52:30,242
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion, all those in favor.

624
00:52:31,903 --> 00:52:33,244
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no motion to table.

625
00:52:33,305 --> 00:52:36,688
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a motion to send a committee of the whole for meeting with the mayor.

626
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:38,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

627
00:52:39,472 --> 00:52:40,252
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion.

628
00:52:43,974 --> 00:52:47,395
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion to refer is taken first.

629
00:52:48,356 --> 00:52:50,957
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, call the roll, please.

630
00:52:53,457 --> 00:52:54,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello?

631
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:55,218
No.

632
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:56,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Felco?

633
00:52:56,319 --> 00:52:56,519
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

634
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:57,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Night?

635
00:52:57,979 --> 00:52:58,199
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

636
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Leclerc?

637
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

638
00:53:01,181 --> 00:53:02,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Montz?

639
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:02,941
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

640
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:03,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Montz?

641
00:53:03,521 --> 00:53:03,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

642
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:05,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli?

643
00:53:05,402 --> 00:53:05,462
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

644
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:07,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President De La Ruza?

645
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:08,988
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

646
00:53:09,249 --> 00:53:14,212
[SPEAKER_04]: With the vote 5 in the negative, 2 in the affirmative, the motion fails.

647
00:53:18,735 --> 00:53:24,479
[SPEAKER_04]: On the invocation of Rule 20, Paragraph 4, debate ceases.

648
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,482
[SPEAKER_04]: My apologies, Mr. Commissioner.

649
00:53:27,822 --> 00:53:33,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your presence here.

650
00:53:36,448 --> 00:53:37,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Lay it on the table for the week.

651
00:53:40,465 --> 00:53:56,093
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councillor Knight to return to the regular order of business.

652
00:53:56,113 --> 00:53:56,133
[SPEAKER_04]: 16-702.

653
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:20,913
[SPEAKER_04]: President DelaRusso, members of the Memphis City Council, from Mayor Stephanie M. Burke, home rule petition increasing the number of licenses available for the sale of wine and malt beverages.

654
00:54:21,593 --> 00:54:28,537
[SPEAKER_16]: Dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request that we waive the reading and have a brief comment from the city solicitor.

655
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:31,818
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, Madam Vice Solicitor.

656
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:34,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President, members of the city council,

657
00:54:35,455 --> 00:54:40,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Kimberly Scanlon, Acting City Solicitor for the City of Medford, residing at 75 Ashcroft Road.

658
00:54:42,217 --> 00:54:50,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Simply put, this Home Rule petition would increase the sale of wine and malt beverages from 25 to 40.

659
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:59,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, it's 25, and after speaking with the Liquor Commission, I had learned that we currently only have three licenses left.

660
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:01,782
[SPEAKER_08]: Therefore, this increase from 25 to 40

661
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:08,456
[SPEAKER_08]: give additional establishments the opportunity to request and receive such a license.

662
00:55:09,256 --> 00:55:13,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I also spoke with our state representative who is aware of this and is in favor.

663
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:14,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

664
00:55:18,202 --> 00:55:20,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

665
00:55:20,103 --> 00:55:32,570
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something that I got involved with way back when this first started through the Chamber of Commerce, and I think we started with 15 licenses, and we're up to 25, and I think that's good.

666
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:38,685
[SPEAKER_11]: We're looking to track those smaller type businesses and I think this is a good idea.

667
00:55:38,705 --> 00:55:45,691
[SPEAKER_11]: It would help bring more business into the town where some people may, business may not want that full liquor license.

668
00:55:45,731 --> 00:55:48,554
[SPEAKER_11]: They just want that beer, wine, and expertise.

669
00:55:49,494 --> 00:55:56,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I would support this wholeheartedly and hope that our state delegation would push this through rather quickly.

670
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I think this is a great idea.

671
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:03,330
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it's something that needs to be examined a little bit further.

672
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly have no problem increasing the number of liquor licenses here in the community and approving a homeowner petition to do that.

673
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:13,018
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I'd like to take a little harder look maybe in the licensing subcommittee.

674
00:56:14,119 --> 00:56:16,100
[SPEAKER_02]: We're increasing it by 15 licenses.

675
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quite a significant number.

676
00:56:19,102 --> 00:56:21,264
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost 100% increase, Mr. President.

677
00:56:21,284 --> 00:56:24,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's certainly something that needs a little bit further investigation.

678
00:56:24,907 --> 00:56:28,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd also like to have somebody from maybe the Department of Economic Development there.

679
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:36,977
[SPEAKER_02]: our community development data discussed with us a little bit about the impact that these licenses will have on their ability to attract businesses to our downtown vacant storefronts.

680
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:44,160
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a motion to send it to the subcommittee on the motion of councilor night.

681
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:48,342
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor, all those opposed.

682
00:56:51,384 --> 00:56:51,764

745
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:18,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. President.

746
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:22,113
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a matter that came before us for a common victor's license just a short time ago.

747
01:00:22,961 --> 01:00:30,445
[SPEAKER_02]: At the time, we spoke with the business owners and informed them that if they wanted to operate extended hours, as indicated on their application, they'd have to come back and get a special permit.

748
01:00:31,585 --> 01:00:33,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears that the paperwork is in order, Mr. President.

749
01:00:34,227 --> 01:00:38,729
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears that this business is looking to do everything according to the letter of the law.

750
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:46,873
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't been violated for staying open past 11 o'clock, and they're waiting their patient opportunity to be allowed to do such, Mr. President.

751
01:00:46,933 --> 01:00:51,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I see no problem with this application, and I would request that the paper be moved for approval.

752
01:00:52,777 --> 01:00:54,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval, Madam Vice President.

753
01:00:54,678 --> 01:00:59,520
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to second the motion for approval and ask, are you planning on doing any delivery?

754
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,981
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're not sure.

755
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:10,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe down the road, but right now we just want to make sure that all of our operations in-house are working well.

756
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:11,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect, thanks.

757
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:13,085
[SPEAKER_13]: My husband's been hounding me to

758
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:16,933
[SPEAKER_13]: get on you to do business delivery, because he enjoys your wings.

759
01:01:17,313 --> 01:01:20,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think that's definitely the way we want to go.

760
01:01:20,054 --> 01:01:26,938
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just sometimes we get a little bit of concern about letting the food out of our control, because it's such a better experience.

761
01:01:27,018 --> 01:01:29,620
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're working towards that.

762
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:30,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Good luck.

763
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,101

01:06:13,423 --> 01:06:13,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

830
01:06:14,644 --> 01:06:15,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Marks?

831
01:06:15,885 --> 01:06:18,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a quick thing, Mr. President.

832
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:25,192
[SPEAKER_14]: This council took a vote during budget season to have poll workers fed.

833
01:06:26,033 --> 01:06:29,696
[SPEAKER_14]: I realize that it didn't happen at the previous election,

834
01:06:30,438 --> 01:06:35,941
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ask that the clerk feed the poll workers, Mr. President, based on a vote of this council.

835
01:06:37,061 --> 01:06:39,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Finn, does that look doable based on?

836
01:06:39,603 --> 01:06:49,968
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on a number of items right now for poll workers and stuff, so we'll have to talk to the registrars and see if we can incorporate something.

837
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:57,952
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a pretty daunting task with the dietary needs of some of these poll workers, so we're trying to figure out

838
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:07,428
[SPEAKER_05]: how to deliver, so it's in the works, but we just don't know what it's going to be and how it's going to be.

839
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:14,894
[SPEAKER_05]: It might not be able to pull it off, but we're just trying to, because it's a tough day, it's a tough election.

840
01:07:14,994 --> 01:07:18,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I know, but you just said you might not be able to pull it off.

841
01:07:18,177 --> 01:07:26,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I can, but it's a matter of trying to get, say you go to a particular vendor and

842
01:07:28,602 --> 01:07:34,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Can they make 16 different locations at 12 o'clock?

843
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:35,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they have first?

844
01:07:37,007 --> 01:07:39,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Even the police, when they do it, they can't get there.

845
01:07:39,228 --> 01:07:40,368
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

846
01:07:40,388 --> 01:07:41,689
[SPEAKER_14]: We could probably stagger it a little bit.

847
01:07:41,749 --> 01:07:43,110
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't have to be right at 12.

848
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:44,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a little bit of planning.

849
01:07:45,031 --> 01:07:45,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

850
01:07:45,831 --> 01:07:50,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't know what the product would actually be for the luncheon, because we don't know.

851
01:07:53,834 --> 01:07:55,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the people, they don't like this, and they don't like this.

852
01:07:55,975 --> 01:07:57,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can't do motions.

853
01:07:57,995 --> 01:08:02,036
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually can't deliver at the temple, but they do provide.

854
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,677
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you have to provide.

855
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:07,658
[SPEAKER_04]: The motion for approval of the call for the election.

856
01:08:07,718 --> 01:08:08,739
[SPEAKER_04]: All those in favor?

857
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

858
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:17,001
[SPEAKER_04]: The election is called for.

859
01:08:17,021 --> 01:08:19,162
[SPEAKER_04]: 16-698 offered by Vice President Lungo Kern.

860
01:08:19,642 --> 01:08:23,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Be resolved that the administration provide the Medford City Council with an update

861
01:08:24,071 --> 01:08:33,315
[SPEAKER_04]: regarding the Republic parking contract and what has transpired with regards to the sale of the company and the negotiations the city was working on.

862
01:08:33,756 --> 01:08:34,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam Vice President.

863
01:08:38,858 --> 01:08:39,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I get you?

864
01:08:39,398 --> 01:08:40,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you got George.

865
01:08:41,139 --> 01:08:42,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

866
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, President Del Rosso.

867
01:08:45,181 --> 01:08:45,601
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

868
01:08:45,781 --> 01:08:49,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Back several months ago, I believe it was before budget,

869
01:08:50,643 --> 01:09:00,825
[SPEAKER_13]: So probably April, May, Republic Parking had sold, and the city was in negotiations with regards to the current contract we had with Republic Parking.

870
01:09:01,285 --> 01:09:12,707
[SPEAKER_13]: We had met with the mayor and the city solicitor, and I believe I began asking questions and wanting to get answers, and I think we were told it's really out of our hands because we're not the negotiating authority.

871
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:15,467
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was in the works.

872
01:09:15,707 --> 01:09:18,868
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been about four or five months now, so if we could get a written update

873
01:09:19,232 --> 01:09:24,035
[SPEAKER_13]: with regards to where we're at, what changes have been made.

874
01:09:24,055 --> 01:09:30,079
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the mayor did discuss tweaks and changes in the contract.

875
01:09:30,139 --> 01:09:43,067
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we could get an update, people are requesting answers from, I don't know about, from me, I don't know about the rest of the council, because people still want to see some changes with the current contract.

876
01:09:43,448 --> 01:09:46,970
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we can get an update from the city solicitor or the mayor's office, whichever,

877
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,627
[SPEAKER_13]: seems appropriate.

878
01:09:48,687 --> 01:09:54,128
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be, um, of, of help to get some answers to ask citizens and to know what's going on.

879
01:09:55,629 --> 01:09:56,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

880
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:58,229
[SPEAKER_11]: Chair recognizes council Caviello.

881
01:09:58,409 --> 01:09:59,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

882
01:09:59,309 --> 01:10:07,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, this counselor has requested on numerous occasions that the council meet with Republic and we've yet to have a meeting with them.

883
01:10:08,631 --> 01:10:15,573
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll ask for the third time that we have a meeting, uh, and the council of the whole with Republic parking.

884
01:10:19,837 --> 01:10:20,457
[SPEAKER_11]: or the new owner.

885
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:23,498
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, this would be the third request that I've made.

886
01:10:23,518 --> 01:10:23,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

887
01:10:24,798 --> 01:10:25,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

888
01:10:25,118 --> 01:10:25,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Counselor.

889
01:10:27,518 --> 01:10:27,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

890
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:28,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

891
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:30,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Please state your name and address for the record.

892
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:31,239
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Robert Penta.

893
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:34,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at zero summit road, former member of the Sargas party.

894
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:37,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, let's take a reflect back on what council car viola just indicated.

895
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:47,862
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, having served on the council with your folks before it was on a couple of occasions that he pressed for the issue regarding a report forthcoming forthcoming forthcoming regarding this.

896
01:10:48,413 --> 01:10:57,635
[SPEAKER_09]: The last one that I seem to have that's available is dated December 4th of 2015, with a breakdown which does not include December of last year.

897
01:10:58,335 --> 01:11:09,358
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a little bit perplexing as it relates to, number one, the citations that were appealed, which were something like 3,054 year-to-date, and the citations that were dismissed, which was 1,375.

898
01:11:10,198 --> 01:11:16,940
[SPEAKER_09]: So almost 45 percent of the citations that were issued up until November of last year were dismissed.

899
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:29,199
[SPEAKER_09]: but then you go to the issue regarding strike that hearings and year to date there was 240 hearings and of those year to date hearings, I think 88 of them were dismissed.

900
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:37,883
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue I think revolves around a whole host of contingencies on with this new pay to park, you can use your phone and what have you.

901
01:11:38,443 --> 01:11:43,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Since there is a new owner out there, I have seen certain problems that have existed personally.

902
01:11:43,486 --> 01:11:46,407
[SPEAKER_09]: Yale Street parking lot, people in the lot after six o'clock at night.

903
01:11:46,905 --> 01:11:47,725
[SPEAKER_09]: giving out tickets.

904
01:11:48,366 --> 01:12:02,371
[SPEAKER_09]: Other parts of the city, the new people that have come on board with this new company, and I don't know who they are because you guys don't have a contract, you should have a copy of the contract as amended, should indicate that these folks should be aware as to what they're doing.

905
01:12:03,092 --> 01:12:16,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, the fact that you can't go out there, these folks are supposed to be identified with a tag on them, with a face on their ID card, so to speak, and not something that's hidden behind their jacket or what have you.

906
01:12:17,282 --> 01:12:18,303
[SPEAKER_09]: and I think.

907
01:12:18,743 --> 01:12:27,447
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing, and it's a concern, it's a bone of contention that I've had since day one, we were told during the last mayoral campaign by this mayor that seniors would be able to park for nothing.

908
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:35,031
[SPEAKER_09]: What you have now is if a senior wants to park in the city, that senior has to pay $25 to have the opportunity to park for nothing.

909
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:46,377
[SPEAKER_09]: They get a card or whatever it might be, and they can't transfer it to another car, because if you're a senior, and you happen to be 65, that's what they use for a standard, and 62 is social security age,

910
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So why it's 65 to be a senior, I don't know.

911
01:12:49,572 --> 01:12:54,136
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you get this little placard or whatever it might be, or sticker, you can't transfer it to another car.

912
01:12:54,336 --> 01:13:02,142
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're a senior driving in the city and your car is either broken down and you wanna use another car, because you are a senior, you should be able to do it.

913
01:13:02,742 --> 01:13:08,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So the requirement doesn't go to the senior, apparently it goes to the car and you're stuck to that particular car.

914
01:13:08,647 --> 01:13:10,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that really needs to be reviewed and looked upon.

915
01:13:11,389 --> 01:13:15,352
[SPEAKER_09]: But more importantly, I just think the statistical analysis should be forthcoming

916
01:13:15,935 --> 01:13:17,596
[SPEAKER_09]: You folks had asked for a monthly basis.

917
01:13:17,956 --> 01:13:21,498
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time you got it was eight months into the, nine months into the year.

918
01:13:21,918 --> 01:13:22,959
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't seem right.

919
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:30,783
[SPEAKER_09]: My suggestion would be to have you have the new people, just like you had a Republic when they first come in, have them come and appear before the council.

920
01:13:31,383 --> 01:13:32,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Air your differences with them.

921
01:13:32,684 --> 01:13:33,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Let them explain to you.

922
01:13:34,144 --> 01:13:36,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Let them explain to the public what the changes might be.

923
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:41,308
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's kind of hard, you know, when people call up and they ask, you know, what can we do?

924
01:13:41,328 --> 01:13:42,589
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we make this thing better?

925
01:13:44,009 --> 01:13:45,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Lady comes to city hall.

926
01:13:45,638 --> 01:13:47,579
[SPEAKER_09]: thinking that she can pay her ticket here.

927
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:48,159
[SPEAKER_09]: She can't.

928
01:13:48,339 --> 01:13:52,600
[SPEAKER_09]: And while she's here trying to pay the ticket, she's outside and she's getting a ticket on her car.

929
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:55,081
[SPEAKER_09]: And she's coming in here thinking this is the way you're supposed to pay the ticket.

930
01:13:55,541 --> 01:13:57,621
[SPEAKER_09]: You go down the street to go to pay the ticket.

931
01:13:57,701 --> 01:13:58,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, oh, too bad, you can't.

932
01:13:59,382 --> 01:14:00,082
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got a ticket.

933
01:14:00,462 --> 01:14:01,482
[SPEAKER_09]: You stayed here too long.

934
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,203
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole host of issues that are still

935
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:04,673
[SPEAKER_09]: surrounding this whole thing.

936
01:14:04,913 --> 01:14:08,654
[SPEAKER_09]: They're into the neighborhoods, where resident parking takes place, and late at night.

937
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,456
[SPEAKER_09]: These things are just multiplying, and nothing seems to be getting better.

938
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:19,899
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you speak to some of the business people in the square, in all the squares, they'll basically tell you that there are more spots open now than there were before.

939
01:14:20,119 --> 01:14:23,881
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great, but their business isn't getting any much better than it was before.

940
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:25,341
[SPEAKER_09]: If anything, it's getting less.

941
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:31,404
[SPEAKER_09]: So the only reprieve that was really given during this past year is when the mayor was in, Mayor McGlynn was here,

942
01:14:31,825 --> 01:14:40,730
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess he worked out a deal with Republic at that time, during the holidays, from November 4th to, I believe, January 3rd, that on the weekends, you didn't have to pay to use the meters.

943
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:45,072
[SPEAKER_09]: But that seems to be something that's not being worked out right now by this company.

944
01:14:45,332 --> 01:14:47,333
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what they're going to do for the holidays this year.

945
01:14:47,734 --> 01:14:48,414
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a new company.

946
01:14:48,454 --> 01:14:49,094
[SPEAKER_09]: They're new in town.

947
01:14:49,635 --> 01:14:58,800
[SPEAKER_09]: But I strongly suggest that you have them before you, rather than having these piecemeal approaches of people with concerns and complaints, because you really need to take a look at the contract.

948
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:01,141
[SPEAKER_09]: You really need to know what they're doing in this community.

949
01:15:01,717 --> 01:15:05,538
[SPEAKER_09]: And Councilor Longo-Kern is right, asking for that because I think the time is near.

950
01:15:05,818 --> 01:15:07,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Your holidays are right around the corner.

951
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions?

952
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Be more than happy to answer them.

953
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:15,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

954
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Nice to see you all smiling tonight.

955
01:15:18,541 --> 01:15:19,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

956
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:20,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

957
01:15:20,862 --> 01:15:22,562
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

958
01:15:22,582 --> 01:15:24,563
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been met.

959
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:26,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Amended by Vice President Longo-Kern.

960
01:15:26,263 --> 01:15:30,124
[SPEAKER_13]: If there is a new contract, that we do get a copy of the amendments.

961
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:38,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Amended by Councilor Lange Kern that if there is a new contract that we get copies of that.

962
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:39,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caviello.

963
01:15:40,282 --> 01:15:43,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I have asked for a third meeting with Republic Parking.

964
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:46,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And that a third meeting be held.

965
01:15:46,204 --> 01:15:47,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, a first meeting.

966
01:15:47,864 --> 01:15:49,245

[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

995
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:04,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

996
01:18:04,788 --> 01:18:11,649
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and looking at this, I mean, I think it looks like we have either five or six, um, students in each grade level.

997
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we can invite them to separate meetings and have them sit in with us as well as receive their, uh, council commendation.

998
01:18:16,930 --> 01:18:23,672
[SPEAKER_02]: If the council is willing to approve this resolution, Mr. President, I think that would be very educational for these individuals who are going to be the future leaders here.

999
01:18:24,095 --> 01:18:28,577
[SPEAKER_02]: in our community and who are the current leaders here in the Medford public school system.

1000
01:18:28,697 --> 01:18:31,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not easy putting your name on the ballot and putting yourself out there to run for office.

1001
01:18:31,919 --> 01:18:36,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And these individuals have done it at a very young age and I commend them and congratulate them on their hard work.

1002
01:18:37,301 --> 01:18:49,766
[SPEAKER_02]: These were the individuals that were successful in their elections and I'm sure there were others that weren't successful, but to put your name out there and to give it a run and to give of yourself and to be willing to provide a public service is something that should be commended, Mr. President.

1003
01:18:51,419 --> 01:18:57,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're going to be responsible also for planning the future high school reunions for years to come.

1004
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,621
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think my 20th is coming up in a couple of weeks.

1005
01:19:00,801 --> 01:19:11,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So as I look at this list and see these names on it, the grade 12 President Anthony McKillop is going to be a name that Medford High alumni in the class of 2017 hear from for a long time.

1006
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:20,245
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to have quite a responsibility at coordinating and organizing these reunions as he graduates and the years go on, Mr. President.

1007
01:19:20,265 --> 01:19:20,965
[SPEAKER_02]: But I move for approval.

1008
01:19:21,358 --> 01:19:23,559
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1009
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:25,019
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1010
01:19:25,539 --> 01:19:26,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion carries.

1011
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk, Mr. President.

1012
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:34,242
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Night, to take the papers in the hands of the clerk.

1013
01:19:34,262 --> 01:19:44,145
[SPEAKER_04]: 16-706, offered by President DelaRusso, be it resolved that the Medgar City Council send sincere condolences to the family of Thomas E. English on his recent passing.

1014
01:19:44,185 --> 01:19:48,907
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have the same motion offered by Councilors Falco and Scarpelli.

1015
01:19:49,844 --> 01:19:53,386
[SPEAKER_04]: If any of the Councillors want to talk about Tom, George.

1016
01:19:54,907 --> 01:20:05,213
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can, I was fortunate not only to be a student of Mr. English, he also mentored me as I started my journey as a teacher in physical education.

1017
01:20:05,233 --> 01:20:08,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just this evening at his wake, we talked to the

1018
01:20:09,426 --> 01:20:18,650
[SPEAKER_06]: the most popular phys ed teacher, Mr. Lou Ruggiero, and he talked to Mr. English, um, called him right away as soon as he was hired just to lend a support.

1019
01:20:18,870 --> 01:20:31,456
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, you know, I, I still remember as a young teacher, uh, running into a fisticuffs of two young men and him stopping and saying, uh, let me teach you how to do this, George.

1020
01:20:31,476 --> 01:20:32,957
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was comical that we

1021
01:20:33,674 --> 01:20:36,016
[SPEAKER_06]: He, we waited and he said, okay, now go.

1022
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:39,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, well, wait, he says, you get the kid on the top, I'll get the kid on the bottom.

1023
01:20:39,778 --> 01:20:41,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's typical Mr. English.

1024
01:20:41,619 --> 01:20:49,985
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know him, he was, uh, you know, and, and he always handled situations in such a, uh, cool and professional way.

1025
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:51,426
[SPEAKER_06]: He was just a great person.

1026
01:20:51,486 --> 01:21:01,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, I know his family, um, graduated with the son, Danny and, uh, and his lovely wife, um, who, uh, Marlene, who's actually,

1027
01:21:02,410 --> 01:21:08,831
[SPEAKER_06]: former secretary at the Andrews Middle School, and just great people, great family, and he'll be missed.

1028
01:21:09,512 --> 01:21:10,132
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be missed.

1029
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:10,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Great person.

1030
01:21:12,872 --> 01:21:13,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor.

1031
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:14,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1032
01:21:14,272 --> 01:21:17,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scott Pelley hit it on the head.

1033
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:19,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Great person, great sense of humor.

1034
01:21:19,994 --> 01:21:25,795
[SPEAKER_10]: I had him for a physical education teacher when I was at the high school, and I'd bump into him in the community off and on.

1035
01:21:28,067 --> 01:21:32,149
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a great person who's definitely going to be missed, and a great family as well.

1036
01:21:32,489 --> 01:21:35,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And thoughts and prayers to the family.

1037
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:36,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1038
01:21:37,631 --> 01:21:40,072
[SPEAKER_04]: A great patriot, a Marine.

1039
01:21:40,332 --> 01:21:40,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1040
01:21:42,793 --> 01:21:45,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Outstanding athlete in his own right.

1041
01:21:46,015 --> 01:21:46,855
[SPEAKER_10]: And a football referee.

1042
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:48,296
[SPEAKER_04]: And a football referee.

1043
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:50,537
[SPEAKER_04]: And a great, great football official.

1044
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:53,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And I must also agree, he married a wonderful woman.

1045
01:21:53,558 --> 01:21:53,858
[SPEAKER_04]: He did.

1046
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:54,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Marlene.

1047
01:21:55,139 --> 01:21:55,459
[SPEAKER_04]: He did.

1048
01:21:55,959 --> 01:21:56,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1049
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:57,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor?

1050
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1051
01:22:01,327 --> 01:22:07,950
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I had, uh, Mr. English, uh, my junior and senior year at the high school.

1052
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:19,333
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can tell you that, uh, typically, uh, phys ed was the type of, uh, class that you'd skip one here, there, but not with Mr. English.

1053
01:22:20,454 --> 01:22:22,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. English did not put up with any of that.

1054
01:22:23,295 --> 01:22:24,715
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, he was a great guy.

1055
01:22:24,755 --> 01:22:25,675
[SPEAKER_14]: I got to know him well.

1056
01:22:26,636 --> 01:22:27,316
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh,

1057
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:30,052
[SPEAKER_14]: He will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1058
01:22:31,233 --> 01:22:48,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

1059
01:22:48,085 --> 01:22:57,172
[SPEAKER_04]: 16-705 offered by Councilor Caviello be it resolved that the Memphis City Council readdress the growing amount of Airbnbs in the City of Medford, impose some rules and regulations,

1060
01:22:57,687 --> 01:23:02,751
[SPEAKER_04]: to oversee them as they are virtually untouched by all local rules and regulations.

1061
01:23:03,452 --> 01:23:03,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor.

1062
01:23:05,953 --> 01:23:06,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1063
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:10,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, this was brought up by Councillor Knight earlier in the year.

1064
01:23:12,999 --> 01:23:23,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if you were to go home and go to the Airbnb site and type in the city of Medford, you'd be shocked the amount of homes that are offering Airbnbs.

1065
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,301
[SPEAKER_11]: and you probably find a bunch in your own neighborhood.

1066
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:34,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Many of the cities have started regulations, some have adopted them, some are in the process of doing it.

1067
01:23:35,664 --> 01:23:49,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at this point, the city of Medford should be a little proactive and develop some type of rules and regulations for them to operate if we choose that we want them to even operate in our city.

1068
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:52,829
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate to see something like happen in Linfield where somebody got killed

1069
01:23:53,797 --> 01:23:54,638
[SPEAKER_11]: happen here in our city.

1070
01:23:55,298 --> 01:24:09,350
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's about time that we refer this to our subcommittee on ordinances or zoning, I don't know which one this would go to, to set up some type of regulations on what to do with the Airbnbs.

1071
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:11,471
[SPEAKER_11]: Would this be zoning, I think?

1072
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Or ordinances?

1073
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:14,954
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do zoning.

1074
01:24:15,515 --> 01:24:16,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Or ordinances, I don't know which one this would go to.

1075
01:24:16,976 --> 01:24:18,597
[SPEAKER_04]: One committee, zoning ordinances.

1076
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:21,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoning in ordinances together.

1077
01:24:21,989 --> 01:24:22,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1078
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,170
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same.

1079
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:23,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1080
01:24:24,371 --> 01:24:24,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1081
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:43,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So, on the motion of Councilor Caviello, that there be a meeting of the subcommittee of zoning and ordinances to take up the issue of these internet sponsored house letting in rooming house organizations.

1082
01:24:44,607 --> 01:24:46,468
[SPEAKER_04]: commonly referred to as Airbnb.

1083
01:24:46,808 --> 01:24:48,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1084
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:49,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

1085
01:24:49,809 --> 01:24:49,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1086
01:24:50,009 --> 01:24:50,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

1087
01:24:50,669 --> 01:24:54,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you, councilor Cabello for keeping the conversation going on this important topic.

1088
01:24:54,891 --> 01:25:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've been keeping a close eye on what's going on when in surrounding communities and the approach that they're taking to dealing with this type of issue.

1089
01:25:01,493 --> 01:25:07,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, they've been starting to designate some of these residences, accessory use residences for short term rental purposes.

1090
01:25:08,705 --> 01:25:18,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So communities that are authorizing and allowing Airbnbs and are regulating them by way of municipal ordinance are starting to develop a criteria on this.

1091
01:25:18,691 --> 01:25:22,753
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somewhat successful in other communities and not so successful in certain communities.

1092
01:25:22,773 --> 01:25:25,275
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's very important that we give this a long hard look, Mr. President.

1093
01:25:25,295 --> 01:25:31,058
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to amend the paper and ask that the city assessor provide us with a list of recommendations.

1094
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:41,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because quite frankly, if a private residence is operating as a short term rental or a hotel, there is some revenue that's out there that the city should be able to capture as well.

1095
01:25:41,772 --> 01:25:43,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think that's very important.

1096
01:25:43,213 --> 01:25:51,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I am of the position that, um, a regulation would be more beneficial to the community and to our city and to our consumers than an outright ban.

1097
01:25:51,797 --> 01:25:53,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of my colleagues on the council may disagree.

1098
01:25:53,718 --> 01:25:58,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the subcommittee is a great place to start with this so that we can make some recommendations, um, conduct some,

1099
01:25:59,035 --> 01:26:03,936
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews and get further educated on the topic before we move into creating some legislation, Mr. President.

1100
01:26:04,477 --> 01:26:09,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Chairman Knight of Zoning and Ordinances.

1101
01:26:09,918 --> 01:26:12,079
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion as amended, all those in favor?

1102
01:26:12,299 --> 01:26:12,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

1103
01:26:12,659 --> 01:26:13,519
[SPEAKER_04]: All those opposed?

1104
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:14,459
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion carries.

1105
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:17,500
[SPEAKER_04]: 7.04 offered by Councillor Marks.

1106
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:26,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Be resolved that the bus stop sign that was knocked down be put back at the correct location of 213A Mills XF.

1107
01:26:26,543 --> 01:26:27,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Councillor Marks.

1108
01:26:28,641 --> 01:26:29,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1109
01:26:29,881 --> 01:26:37,463
[SPEAKER_14]: It was about three years ago I was contacted by a number of business owners at that stretch of Middlesex Ave.

1110
01:26:38,203 --> 01:26:39,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone familiar with that?

1111
01:26:39,363 --> 01:26:48,745
[SPEAKER_14]: There used to be a bus stop that stretched about six car lengths in front of the businesses, and it took up a majority of the parking.

1112
01:26:49,565 --> 01:26:57,247
[SPEAKER_14]: We got together with the T, along with the business owners, and we narrowed the space where the bus can stop to pick up some additional spots.

1113
01:26:58,057 --> 01:27:10,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Just recently, a car knocked down the bus sign that was erected on a single pole, and the T erected the sign back at the old location.

1114
01:27:10,845 --> 01:27:12,806
[SPEAKER_14]: So it took us almost two years to get.

1115
01:27:13,547 --> 01:27:14,748
[SPEAKER_14]: We're back at step one again.

1116
01:27:15,308 --> 01:27:23,773
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask that the T look at their records, Mr. President, and relocate the bus stop sign in front of 213A

1117
01:27:25,398 --> 01:27:35,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Middlesex ave where it was voted on and approved for relocation back some two or three years ago.

1118
01:27:35,607 --> 01:27:42,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And that paper is going to be sent to the mbta division of bus stops locations, yes?

1119
01:27:45,156 --> 01:27:49,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't had much success with them but if that's where it goes, that's where it goes.

1120
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:50,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1121
01:27:50,804 --> 01:27:52,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have a representative?

1122
01:27:52,265 --> 01:27:56,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have a representative to the T point of information council Scott?

1123
01:27:56,668 --> 01:28:03,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can actually just one name that's been receptive anyways, uh, Dan fielding department of transportation.

1124
01:28:03,773 --> 01:28:06,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he has a direct line to the T if we can.

1125
01:28:06,955 --> 01:28:10,617
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe, maybe if we could send it to him as well, CC it to Dan.

1126
01:28:10,638 --> 01:28:19,404
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll end up sending it to Brian short director, general manager, and then I'll copy.

1127
01:28:19,444 --> 01:28:19,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1128
01:28:20,944 --> 01:28:21,464
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

1129
01:28:22,265 --> 01:28:25,407
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1130
01:28:26,688 --> 01:28:28,489
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1131
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:30,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Carries.

1132
01:28:30,711 --> 01:28:41,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Citizen wishes to make a brief commercial announcement at the podium to announce honoring veterans and DAV 5K race.

1133
01:28:41,758 --> 01:28:42,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam Citizen.

1134
01:28:42,928 --> 01:28:45,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1135
01:28:45,509 --> 01:28:47,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for letting me speak and announce this.

1136
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:53,771
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a breakfast on November 11th at 9 a.m.

1137
01:28:54,391 --> 01:28:57,752
[SPEAKER_01]: at the First Baptist Church, 29 Oakland Street, Medford Mass.

1138
01:28:59,093 --> 01:29:01,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just tell you a little bit briefly about it.

1139
01:29:02,874 --> 01:29:07,755
[SPEAKER_01]: The church bell tower was first dedicated to 13 men and one woman who died in World War II.

1140
01:29:08,383 --> 01:29:10,804
[SPEAKER_01]: from the congregation of the First Baptist Church in 1948.

1141
01:29:11,485 --> 01:29:20,249
[SPEAKER_01]: The bells have been recently refurbished, and the congregation would like to once again honor veterans with the patriotic music from these bells.

1142
01:29:21,269 --> 01:29:28,933
[SPEAKER_01]: A short performance of this music will occur as veterans congregate on the steps of the church at 9 AM, followed by an honorary breakfast.

1143
01:29:28,973 --> 01:29:29,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Please join us.

1144
01:29:30,434 --> 01:29:31,275
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right here in Medford.

1145
01:29:32,713 --> 01:29:44,183
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason why everybody can't be there, veterans and their families, and especially any widows or spouses, family members, because kids suffer too.

1146
01:29:45,884 --> 01:29:54,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with this generation, I hear a lot of kids that have to move from place to place and change school to change school when their fathers and mothers are in the service.

1147
01:29:55,842 --> 01:29:59,244
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a child of a veteran, please come too.

1148
01:30:00,245 --> 01:30:10,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the DAV 5K, if you don't mind, it's a run to honor veterans and you can go to DAV5K.org and you can find out all about it.

1149
01:30:10,711 --> 01:30:21,957
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that they want to stress is if you have a track team in your high school, so Medford High, get the track team involved, go to DAV5K.org and get signed up on it.

1150
01:30:22,437 --> 01:30:23,358
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't run,

1151
01:30:24,164 --> 01:30:29,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Like me, I'm going to volunteer, but you can sponsor somebody with money to run.

1152
01:30:29,650 --> 01:30:30,671
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be advertised.

1153
01:30:30,711 --> 01:30:34,115
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be an RKO spot the whole day before.

1154
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:38,599
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of money being poured into the city for it and everything, so you'll hear about it.

1155
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:43,424
[SPEAKER_01]: But just so that you can sign up early, it's the DAV 5K.

1156
01:30:43,645 --> 01:30:45,767
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be at Castle Island in South Boston.

1157
01:30:46,109 --> 01:30:48,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Great location for a run.

1158
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:48,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

1159
01:30:49,931 --> 01:30:50,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

1160
01:30:51,091 --> 01:30:52,872
[SPEAKER_01]: That's November 11th at 9 a.m.

1161
01:30:53,812 --> 01:30:57,413
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that they're going to have something at the VFW at 11 as well.

1162
01:30:57,834 --> 01:31:00,295
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go, you can hop from one to the other.

1163
01:31:02,455 --> 01:31:03,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Jean.

1164
01:31:03,536 --> 01:31:06,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your advocacy for our veterans.

1165
01:31:06,197 --> 01:31:06,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1166
01:31:08,998 --> 01:31:09,498
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

1167
01:31:09,698 --> 01:31:10,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Counselor.

1168
01:31:10,859 --> 01:31:13,580
[SPEAKER_10]: If I may, before the minutes, make a quick announcement.

1169
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:14,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do.

1170
01:31:14,807 --> 01:31:15,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1171
01:31:15,788 --> 01:31:32,240
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, this is just to remind everyone, uh, uh, earlier this year, I had a motion about moving the community police meetings, uh, the monthly meetings out to the neighborhoods and tomorrow night the, uh, Medford police department's community service meeting will be at, uh, the Brooke school.

1172
01:31:33,661 --> 01:31:37,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and that's going to be at 7 PM and everyone is welcome.

1173
01:31:37,123 --> 01:31:39,505
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to live in that neighborhood to go to the meeting.

1174
01:31:39,685 --> 01:31:42,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone from all over the city is welcome to attend.

1175
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:45,896
[SPEAKER_10]: to talk about issues related to the police and whatnot.

01:31:46,476 --> 01:31:50,059
[SPEAKER_10]: So it starts at 7, over at the Brooks Elementary School.

1182
01:32:04,632 --> 01:32:08,676
