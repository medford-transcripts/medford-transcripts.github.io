Burke, Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=300.466s">Commissioner</a>  Kerins, welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=303.028s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, Madam Vice President, members of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=308.39s">As</a>  stated, Mr. President, the City of Medford began to receive the reimbursement monies for the winter of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=322.908s">That</a>  particular year, we'll probably never forget, we were highly impacted, particularly the month of January, with, you know, not inches, but feet of snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=333.471s">There</a>  was a declaration declared by the governor at the time, and FEMA entered into the picture, and reimbursement process began shortly thereafter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=347.135s">What's</a>  happening now is the checks are beginning to arrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=352.265s">back</a>  to the cities and towns that were impacted by the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=358.389s">And,</a>  you know, I have attached here a cover sheet with the breakdown of the actual monies as far as where I would like to, you know, spread them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=371.399s">When</a>  the approvals came in and the money started arriving, the first order of business was to make sure that there was no outstanding debts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=381.423s">You</a>  know, as a result of that storm, working very closely with Auditor Baker, you know, my office staff and I, we pulled together a wish list that I went to the mayor with that we desperately could use that money, which was above and beyond what the Council had approved earlier in the budget, to assist us in trying to speed up the process in different areas that we were, you know, actually being impacted with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=410.5s">uh,</a>  due to, you know, time, manpower, money and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=414.541s">Uh,</a>  the first installment as you'll see on the, uh, uh, for on the, uh, cover sheet, uh, was, uh, $287,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=423.044s">Uh,</a>  that check has arrived and has been, uh, uh, deposited by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=431.166s">Um,</a>  the two other checks that are still outstanding, the one 44, three, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=440.107s">That's</a>  still in the reviewing process within FEMA and the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=447.873s">And</a>  an additional $174,649, that's for damages that had occurred during that storm up at the house at the cemetery and also the repair garage up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=461.964s">That's</a>  still in the hands of FEMA, subject to their approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=467.412s">And,</a>  you know, just a question of time that that money will be forthcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=472.655s">But</a>  getting back to the 287,000, what the Department of Public Works would like to request here is 100,000 just on catch basin repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=488.843s">We</a>  have, you know, numerous catch basins out in the city that have collapsed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=495.688s">They're</a>  desperately in need of repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=498.59s">There's</a>  a little over 4,500 catch basins in the city, just for everybody's information here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=505.955s">And</a>  quite honestly, you know, we cannot keep up with the demands of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=511.738s">And</a>  what, you know, we're requesting is that, you know, putting out, you know, just a rebuilding contract to rebuild the basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=523.121s">Cost</a>  per basin, it could vary within the industry depending on the condition of the catch basin that you'd be repairing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=533.188s">It</a>  could range anywhere from as low as maybe $1,500 to possibly up to $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=540.332s">And</a>  the reason the spread would be is whether or not you needed a new frame and a cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=545.65s">whether</a>  or not you have to go five or six feet down into the actual basin and rebuild the walls of the actual basin itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=555.715s">So</a>  each structure is going to vary as far as cost and as far as, you know, how many we can get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=562.079s">But,</a>  you know, we would like to hit the road running just on that contract to assist, you know, the highway department in, you know, managing, you know, the storm drain system throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=575.58s">request</a>  was for $25,000, and that's for highway ordinary sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=582.462s">Now,</a>  the council was kind enough to approve and appropriate a half a million dollars for the rebuilding of sidewalks earlier this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=592.584s">The</a>  bid had gone out, and the low bidder came back as Marchesi and Son, but it came back at $543,200. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=606.462s">And</a>  again, we were appropriated, you know, $500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=611.586s">Now</a>  with some moving around of funding within our existing budget, what we need is an additional $14,000 to meet that entire cost of $543,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=622.074s">Now</a>  I did ask for $25,000, the balance of the $11,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=634.565s">All</a>  right, out of that 25 would go strictly, all right, for tree stump removal in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=641.028s">All</a>  right, this would go above and beyond the existing sidewalk contract, and also the language that's in there that they also remove tree stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=653.172s">This</a>  is just for stumps only, and then the repairs, whether it be for asphalt, concrete, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=660.283s">or</a>  dirt and lumen seed, excuse me, that would be done, you know, by the in-house forces would come in behind to make, you know, the permanent repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=673.01s">That's</a>  providing that the homeowner that the stump was removed from did not request, you know, a replacement tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=682.695s">Those</a>  would be handled differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=684.216s">They</a>  would be boxed out and, you know, a new tree installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=689.938s">Now</a>  getting on to the trees, we're requesting an additional $30,000 in the tree planting account. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=701.1s">And</a>  the reason for that is we're going to be planting about 130, 135 trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=707.942s">But</a>  the cost of the trees within one year's time, and at the very back of the packet that I gave you was a copy of last year's bid and this year's bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=719.575s">And</a>  the cost per tree has really, you know, gone up substantially. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=726.42s">You'll</a>  notice, okay, on the existing, the first page, all right, the cost per tree has gone up, all right, $90 per tree this year compared to last. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=742.231s">That's</a>  if it's planted in concrete or hot top. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=745.592s">an</a>  additional $100 if it's in a grass plot or a gravel area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=751.857s">In</a>  order to keep up with the tree program that the city has, you know, the $30,000 would cover the new contract that, you know, once it's awarded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=764.848s">And</a>  then we can continue, you know, come in the fall and then in the spring to, you know, plant the new trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=771.674s">But</a>  the cost of trees has just dramatically increased, as you can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=777.598s">The</a>  last request that we have for the Traffic Commission is for ordinary street signs, and that's for $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=786.264s">And</a>  that's to keep up with the ever-increasing demand of replacing worn or faded out Chapter 90 signs, directional signs, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=799.147s">and</a>  just informational signs that may be out there that could be worn, faded, distorted, or, you know, or hit as a result of a motor vehicle accident and that we want to, you know, replenish our stocks so that way we have, you know, pretty much every variety of sign that, you know, is requested and we can install them, you know, in a timely fashion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=824.457s">Thank</a>  you for that detailed discourse, Commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=828.074s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=830.755s">Mr.</a>  Terrence, this money gets appropriated, say, this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=833.995s">How</a>  soon before we see the work that starts to get performed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=837.896s">Are</a>  we going to try to get some of this work done before the 1st for us, or is this something that... No, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=843.717s">This</a>  would be something that would happen right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=847.738s">As</a>  far as the stump removals are concerned, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=851.361s">I</a>  mean, we already have, um, you know, assisting our forestry division, um, uh, early odorous company, uh, who comes in and assists, all right, on, you know, removing trees, uh, lifting trees with, uh, our forestry unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=865.593s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=866.734s">I</a>  would have them come in, all right, with a stump, stump grinder unit right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=871.838s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=872.058s">So</a>  we would hit the ground running, um, on that as far as the Marchese, um, appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=879.705s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=880.708s">One,</a>  if, if approved, uh, then the, uh, purchasing would, uh, award the contract and, uh, my Casey and sons would be ready to go probably within, uh, you know, a week or two's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=893.178s">Uh,</a>  once, uh, the word is given, uh, as far as the trees are concerned, uh, the city Arborist has already, uh, been to Leo's, uh, seen, uh, some of the product that is on hand and some of the product that we would be receiving in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=909.682s">So</a>  that's pretty much on track as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=913.464s">As</a>  far as signs are concerned, it's just a simple case of issuing a purchase order to the sign company with the quantity and the types of signs that we need, and then we'd get delivery pretty much in a timely fashion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=930.511s">Mr.</a>  President, this is quite a well-thought-out and thorough presentation, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=935.655s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Kearns, for doing a wonderful job on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=937.717s">This</a>  is certainly something that I have no problem approving this evening or voting in favor of this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=941.52s">So</a>  I'd move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=943.762s">On</a>  the motion for approval, chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=947.225s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=949.647s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Kearns, for coming and bringing us all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=952.99s">The</a>  $165,000 from FEMA, can you remind me what the total <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=959.975s">reimbursement</a>  to Medford is?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=964.236s">As</a>  far as snow-related removal, the snow on the roofs plus also the snow removal from traffic intersections and the hauling of the snow in the city that had taken place at the time, that came out to be $431,489.46 total. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=987.734s">Reimbursement</a>  to the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=988.935s">Reimbursement</a>  to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=990.155s">That's</a>  the exact figure, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=994.498s">And</a>  then a separate appropriation due to it being structures for the house at the cemetery and also the maintenance garage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1004.203s">That</a>  was going to be $174,649.83 once it's approved and sent by FEMA.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1016.506s">So</a>  this $165,000 is the first payment of approximately $600,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1022.208s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1022.269s">The</a>  first payment that has been received already is $287,179, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1024.55s">So</a>  this $165,000 then is the second payment? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1025.71s">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1025.87s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1025.99s">And</a>  then if you could just remind us,</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1044.768s">that</a>  we had appropriated for stump removal and sidewalk replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1049.651s">I</a>  believe we were going to try to get a majority of our stumps removed from this outline you gave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1055.655s">It</a>  looks like 26 have been done within the last few months.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1062.099s">That</a>  was done by our in-house forces, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1066.462s">The</a>  approach that we're going to try to attempt here is really a two-pronged attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1071.926s">We</a>  will have the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1074.38s">And</a>  in the contract, the language with my Casey and sons, as far as the removal of tree stumps and the restoration of the sidewalks that were compromised. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1084.508s">But</a>  in addition to that, all right, this would be just strictly a stump grinding contract that would take place that would go throughout the city in areas that the sidewalks are not on the list to be repaired due to a tree that may have fallen down from a storm or motor vehicle accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1104.471s">or</a>  quite honestly fatigue, but the sidewalks presently are not compromised. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1110.573s">So</a>  we would be just simply grinding them out in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1114.074s">And</a>  then if a tree was requested by that homeowner, we would be going in there once the city average gave the go ahead to plant a new tree.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1124.377s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1125.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1125.897s">Can</a>  you, can you tell us then where we're at with the 500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1127.817s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1130.132s">right</a>  now where we did not, the department of public works did not have enough money to cover the low bid, the low bid being 543,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1137.577s">We're</a>  able to move around some of our existing money within public works, but we were still shot the 14,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1148.245s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1148.866s">To</a>  come up to the grand total. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1151.087s">If</a>  approved, then, uh, purchasing, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1155.19s">Would</a>  release, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1156.72s">and</a>  award the contract to Marchese, who has already, you know, been alerted by the city that, you know, something could happen depending on the approval of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1169.645s">And,</a>  you know, he'd start as soon as he got the word.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1174.488s">So</a>  we haven't even started to expend the $500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1176.608s">No,</a>  as of this moment, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1179.21s">So</a>  that would explain why only $26,000 had been removed for the $281,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1182.471s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1182.671s">Okay,</a>  so we're going to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1185.552s">If</a>  that process takes place, contract awarded, are we talking the spring then, that would be spent?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1191.275s">No,</a>  my approach right now is we probably have maybe three weeks left as far as concrete is concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1200.679s">Asphalt,</a>  okay, we can push the envelope right through the end of November. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1205.822s">So</a>  what I would like to do, sitting with the engineers, assess the list and do the sidewalks that would be replaced with asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1215.842s">As</a>  far as the concrete is concerned, that is going to be a weather permitting, but come the beginning of November, you know, we don't want to, you know, compromise, you know, any kind of work that would involve concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1226.21s">So,</a>  we would, you know, put a moratorium on until the beginning of April.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1231.894s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1233.255s">I</a>  think that covers everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1234.316s">So,</a>  the delay in the awarding the contract was?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1238.76s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1239.46s">Quite</a>  honestly, the low bidder, you know, we appropriated the 500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1244.765s">but</a>  the low bidder, uh, it was my Casey and he came in at 543,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1249.907s">So</a>  in order to, to move forward, we have to work, you know, cover the balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1257.43s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1259.471s">Thank</a>  you, madam vice president chair recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1264.093s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1264.913s">And</a>  I thank the DPW commissioner, Mr. Karen's for coming before us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1270.055s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1272.638s">Uh,</a>  I gotta say I'm a little disappointed because it was several months ago that, uh, the mayor requested from this body that we appropriate $500,000 for the immediate repair of sidewalks and tree stump removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1290.685s">And</a>  when did that happen, Brian?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1293.365s">Uh,</a>  that happened, uh, you know, obviously prior to, uh, beginning of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1297.944s">maybe</a>  in sometime early June. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1300.146s">I</a>  mean, I don't, I don't, I don't have the date Councilor in front of me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1303.949s">So,</a>  so early June, uh, we were told as a body that we needed this money immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1309.453s">Cause</a>  I remember some members of the council and you probably remember the night, uh, wanted to get a little more involved with what exactly we were going to do for this 500,000, which sidewalks were going to be replaced, how many sidewalks, how many stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1324.966s">And</a>  we were told at the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1326.851s">Well,</a>  if you let this go on another week, uh, it's going to be a week longer before we get to the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1332.392s">And</a>  here we are in October and, uh, I'm dumbfounded that the city would come before us for a half a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1342.635s">And</a>  you must have had a plan saying we want to accomplish this many sidewalks and this many stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1350.777s">And</a>  then for the low bidder to come back at 543,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1355.332s">$43,000</a>  above what the city was requesting either tells me one or two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1362.094s">That</a>  your list was unrealistic, meaning the amount of money you were looking for for the type of work you wanted done could never be accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1371.636s">And</a>  that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1373.156s">And</a>  the second thing is that I'd like to see, and I don't know if you have a copy with you, but when we originally asked for a listing of what was going to be done, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1383.824s">and</a>  I remember specifically asking you about what was the cost per panel, and you gave us a cost, I think it was kind of on a low end of it, we figured out afterwards, but I don't understand where the miscommunication is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1401.433s">If</a>  you presented a list or a request for proposal, whatever went out to the bidders, and it said we want what? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1410.017s">How</a>  many sidewalks done? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1412.157s">Is</a>  that how it went out?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1413.218s">We're</a>  looking for?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1413.758s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1414.898s">And</a>  how many were asked? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1416.039s">How</a>  many panels were asked?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1417.039s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1417.36s">I</a>  don't have that information, you know, in front of me or council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1419.941s">I</a>  wasn't prepared, uh, uh, for it, but, uh, you know, going, uh, over the entire package with our engineers, as far as, you know, what the industry standards were, you know, for the most part, uh, you know, what we've found. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1433.447s">And</a>  it was something that I was concerned right from day one is where the economy in a very good way, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1441.913s">is</a>  very good, very strong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1444.093s">Contractors,</a>  just no different than Leo's landscaping, are coming in with these prices that are far beyond our expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1454.955s">You</a>  know, if this was a few years ago, when the economy was a little tighter, I think that, you know, a lot of these contractors would have tightened their belt a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1465.257s">The</a>  second thing is, obviously, that we're all privy to, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1469.979s">was</a>  the fact that our budget director had left. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1474.222s">And</a>  as a result, of course, of the budget director leaving, you know, everything was sort of going then at a much slower pace till, you know, the permanent appointment was made. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1486.79s">And</a>  when the permanent appointment was made by the mayor, then it was, you know, like, you know, bees to honey, where, you know, she was inundated with all kinds of paperwork, you know, to process different, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1499.637s">purchase</a>  orders, bids, awards, whatever was left there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1505.281s">And</a>  it unfortunately took her a little time to get up to speed and get caught up with everything that was continuing to be generated after Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1514.807s">Miller</a>  left.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1516.788s">I</a>  understand that, and I can appreciate that, because I know for a period of time the city did not have a purchasing agent, and that was a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1527.427s">But</a>  on the flip side, if the bid went out and the lowest bid came back at $543,000, why as a city couldn't you go back to the drawing table and say, you know what, rather than doing 300 panels and 40 stumps, do 270 panels and 36 stumps?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1548.112s">That</a>  could have been an option, Councilor, but our first approach was <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1553.108s">where</a>  it had taken so long just to get that far and get it out on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1558.513s">But</a>  we know why it took so long.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1560.896s">Because</a>  we didn't have someone in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1563.278s">Well,</a>  exactly.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1565.04s">I</a>  wanted to make an attempt to see internally within our budget <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1570.512s">if</a>  we could just cover the balance that was needed to move it ahead rather than start to reinvent the wheel and put it back out to bid again, which would have taken several more weeks delay before we even knew if there was going to be any bidders that were going to be low enough at the time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1592.108s">I</a>  think it's fair to say, as you just mentioned, we have about a three week window to pour cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1597.837s">It's</a>  fair to say, I don't think we're going to be pouring much cement within that three-week window.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1602.518s">No,</a>  and you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1604.258s">But</a>  we can continue to do asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1609.459s">Asphalt,</a>  all right, we can continue to do, unless we get into these flash freezes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1615.82s">And</a>  on the breakdown that I've given all the members of the council here, it broke it down as far as what was concrete and what was asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1626.138s">So</a>  we could continue, all right, the asphalt portion of it, all right, up to a point, and then obviously, depending on the, you know, how the weather is, you know, we just may have to cease operations till springtime.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1639.942s">Okay,</a>  so that leads to my other point then. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1645.424s">Year</a>  after year since I've been on the council, and it's been a number of years, we run a deficit in the snow and ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1652.166s">I</a>  mean, you can almost bet on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1654.665s">that</a>  our budget does not match what we spend for snow and ice removal every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1659.929s">Now,</a>  here we have some money coming back based on a particular storm that we received some funding for, and we're taking the money from snow and ice that we know that account is going to go into a deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1673.858s">I</a>  bet you right now that that account will be in a deficit, and we're spending it on catch basins, which we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1681.223s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1682.124s">We're</a>  spending it on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1683.855s">We're</a>  spending on other tree planters and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1687.997s">Why</a>  wouldn't we, as a city, saying, knowing the history of this community, not funding fully the budget for snow and ice, why wouldn't we take that money and put it back in snow and ice?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1700.883s">Well,</a>  the question I have is, what if we have a winter like we had this year, and there would be a surplus? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1708.627s">It's</a>  a risk that we take.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1711.008s">You've</a>  been around a lot of years, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1713.533s">And</a>  that was the first time I've ever seen a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1716.295s">So,</a>  in the 15 years I've been on the council, one year there was a surplus, 14 years we were in deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1722.84s">If</a>  I was a betting man, I'd say we're probably going to be in deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1725.982s">And</a>  I've been in New England a long time, as well as you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1728.784s">And,</a>  you know, the mild winters are few and far between. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1731.547s">So,</a>  you know, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1734.088s">I</a>  just, you know, I'm having deja vu again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1737.671s">I'm</a>  having deja vu with the sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1740.693s">You</a>  know, you request a half a million dollars, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1743.813s">And</a>  I've asked the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1745.174s">I</a>  talked to the mayor a couple of weeks ago when she called me on something. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1747.955s">That</a>  was the first thing I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1749.096s">I</a>  said, how many sidewalks and stumps have been done with the 500,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1752.638s">And</a>  she said, we are in the process of awarding the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1757.12s">This</a>  is months after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1759.181s">And</a>  now we're coming back before the council saying, give us a little more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1763.283s">It's</a>  not a lot, but give us a little more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1767.385s">I</a>  really have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1769.626s">I</a>  really do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1770.167s">I'd</a>  rather see this go back out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1773.178s">Or</a>  I'd rather see you sit down with the low bidder and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1777.582s">And</a>  I don't know if you can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1778.783s">Maybe</a>  it has to go back out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1780.465s">But</a>  sit down with the low bidder and say, give us $500,000 worth of sidewalks and stump removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1787.451s">That's</a>  what I'd rather see done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1790.815s">The</a>  second piece you mentioned about catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1794.198s">You</a>  mentioned there are 4,500 catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1796.76s">And</a>  I think you remember a couple of months ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1799.396s">I</a>  said you can go down any street and see a sunken catch basin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1802.578s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1803.158s">That's</a>  how bad it's getting in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1805.5s">You</a>  provided a list to us which seems to be probably calls that were made to the mayor's office within the last year or so requesting a catch basin on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1818.868s">Do</a>  we have a full list of catch basins that need repair? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1822.618s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1822.878s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1823.078s">The,</a>  the highway and the highway department is, has been compiling ongoing as they see, you know, a base and they make a, you know, notation of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1831.521s">Um,</a>  I mean right now I think, you know, total combined, we're probably all right, you know, like 40, 45 basins that, you know, have been visually seen and verified out there that needs some form of rebuilding, maybe not total restoration, but some in addition to this list that was provided today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1848.647s">No,</a>  it'd be total. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1849.687s">That'd</a>  be total. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1850.368s">Total</a>  Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1851.408s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1852.515s">And,</a>  you know, and I realize you just started doing that check throughout the city.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1858.878s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1859.478s">As</a>  far as the basins are concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1860.938s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1861.399s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1861.699s">No,</a>  this is something that started up once we get into, uh, you know, springtime, um, you know, obviously we were receiving calls from people, but then, uh, you know, once, uh, the weather broke, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1873.432s">We</a>  had the big sweep, and a lot of the basins then were exposed, you know, from the leaves and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1879.916s">And</a>  the debris from the winter, we were able to actually physically see the basins out there and how many were actually, you know, collapsing or on the verge of collapsing.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1888.5s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1889.861s">So</a>  if you were going to give an estimate of how many catch basins need some type of repair, and I realize it could vary from 1,500 to 5,000, what would be your thought out of the 4,500?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1903.26s">You</a>  know, again, Council, it's hard to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1904.961s">I</a>  mean, if you're talking a catch basin, all right, that is below street grade, you know, one inch. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1910.203s">I</a>  mean, you're talking every basin in New England, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1915.205s">They</a>  all vary, all right, as far as, you know, the street grade is concerned and the pitch of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1920.387s">They're</a>  not supposed to be pitched. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1921.628s">They're</a>  supposed to be level with the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1923.468s">But</a>  as far as them actually being flush is concerned, all right, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1928.397s">it's</a>  hard to guess.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1930.139s">I</a>  know, but I'm not talking about being flush. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1932.58s">I</a>  mean, our streets are riddled with potholes, our sidewalks are cracked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1936.523s">I'm</a>  talking about catch basins that when you look at, you say, wow, that catch basin is sinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1942.368s">I</a>  mean, the average person looking at it could spot it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1945.049s">Not</a>  talking about a lip between the street and the catch basin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1949.373s">Roughly,</a>  what do you think we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1950.673s">OK,</a>  at the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1953.642s">So</a>  we're looking at probably 450 catch basins that need some type of repair?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1958.685s">Some</a>  type of repair, or by spring, possibly, depending on the winter, could accelerate the process and deterioration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1967.871s">So</a>  do we have a listing of these catch basins? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1972.494s">The</a>  list that I provided you was the list that came into the DPW office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1978.757s">In</a>  addition to that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1980.122s">Our</a>  engineering division and our highway department have been compiling a list as they go along, making a notation, compiling the list of basins that need some form of attention.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1990.266s">So</a>  when will this list be done?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1992.027s">Excuse</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1992.667s">When</a>  will this list be done, finalized? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1995.509s">It'll</a>  never be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=1996.849s">It's</a>  going to be an ongoing list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2000.951s">I</a>  could give you everything up to today, but by the end of the week, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2006.34s">two</a>  or three more may have been already entered into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2008.701s">It's</a>  hard to say.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2009.502s">So,</a>  so, so we have a private contractor that's going around currently cleaning the catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2014.464s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2015.585s">Why,</a>  why wouldn't we ask the private contractor as part of cleaning the basins to also provide us a list because they do this for a living, provide us a list of catch basins that currently is sinking and that needs some type of interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2033.795s">Why</a>  wouldn't we take that step, even if it was an additional cost, why wouldn't we take that step to at least point out in the community, because I really believe we're at a real, real point of concern here with these catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2050.561s">And,</a>  you know, if you want to talk about flooding in the community like we had in the Lawrence Estates and so forth, don't attend to your catch basins, and then you're really going to see some major flooding and flooding of basements throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2063.931s">And</a>  people are going to be irate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2066.132s">And</a>  I think we're at a point right now where many of our catch basins are going to collapse onto themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2072.754s">And</a>  that's going to be a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2074.194s">That's</a>  going to be a real major concern in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2076.435s">And</a>  I don't think we're addressing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2077.695s">I'm</a>  not pointing the finger at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2078.856s">You've</a>  been here a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2080.896s">But</a>  we're not addressing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2081.877s">We</a>  have no list that we can look at, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2085.818s">You</a>  can't show me a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2087.178s">It's</a>  being compiled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2088.579s">Well,</a>  I realize that it's a work in progress, but at some point, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2093.547s">You</a>  know, this is not the, we're not talking to the City of New York here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2097.708s">We're</a>  talking to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2098.868s">At</a>  some point, we should be able to get a number, a good number of catch basins that need to be attended to and what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2108.091s">Again,</a>  we're being presented with piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2111.952s">Okay,</a>  here's 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2112.572s">We</a>  may or may not get to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2116.153s">That's</a>  what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2117.374s">We</a>  may or may not get to these.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2119.674s">If</a>  the money was appropriated, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2123.034s">A</a>  bid would go out right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2125.476s">As</a>  far as the cost is concerned, every basin that needs attention, their condition is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2134.424s">Some</a>  may have steel plates on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2136.265s">We've</a>  all seen that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2137.546s">And</a>  then you have others that may have a slight pitch. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2141.91s">We</a>  go by what the industry standards are as far as costs are concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2147.514s">And</a>  right now, the cost could be as low as the $1,500 <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2152.319s">And</a>  that would just be simple, reset the cover, the ring, some barrel block cement, we move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2159.644s">Or</a>  it could be full five feet, rebuilding the actual walls and coming up, and also a new cover and ring, which would be in the vicinity of $5,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2173.113s">So</a>  each one is going to vary as far as the condition and also the cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2179.4s">but</a>  it's a really simple case of going by industry standards.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2183.742s">So</a>  why wouldn't we take advantage of some of the surplus money in the water and sewer accounts, the $8 million that we have in water and sewer? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2192.165s">Why</a>  wouldn't we be looking at some of this funding to start replacing catch basins and doing some of the work we'd need throughout the community?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2200.269s">That's</a>  a mayoral decision.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2204.971s">I</a>  realize that, but I think as long as this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2208.215s">keeps</a>  approving anything that's presented to us, I think we're going to be faced with this piecemeal approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2215.901s">And</a>  again, Brian, this is not directed at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2219.103s">I'm</a>  just tired of a piecemeal approach to everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2223.226s">And</a>  that seems to be, again, what we're facing here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2227.109s">And</a>  I, as one member, am not going to support this tonight because I think, as I stated last week when we were talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2236.56s">the</a>  capital plan that we wanted for this community and the mayor presented the Plan for City Hall here with nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2245.563s">It</a>  was this council that stood up and said madam mayor We want the capital plan before we move forward and sure enough the committee the whole meeting last Wednesday the mayor presented her draft capital plan and You know again, I would ask my colleagues that we either <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2266.482s">table</a>  this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2268.403s">I</a>  know there might be some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2269.783s">I'm</a>  just throwing this out there that we table this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2272.964s">Uh,</a>  so we can have a full discussion with the mayor because Brian's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2277.866s">He's</a>  doing yeoman's work, but I want to know the direction we're going in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2281.868s">And</a>  I don't think doing piecemeal, uh, 24 catch basins here, a few sidewalks here, uh, is adequate enough for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2291.251s">And</a>  maybe when we talk about capital planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2294.744s">that</a>  that should be mixed in with the capital planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2297.245s">What</a>  is the five-year plan for our streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2300.267s">What</a>  is the five? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2301.147s">Councilor</a>  Knight brought this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2302.708s">He</a>  brought up about x-raying our streets so we can get on top of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2306.73s">And</a>  here we are tonight, really, with a Band-Aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2309.532s">This</a>  is a Band-Aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2311.553s">And</a>  you know what happens when you pull off a Band-Aid? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2314.995s">You</a>  get an ouch. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2316.715s">And</a>  we've received a lot of ouches in the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2320.638s">And,</a>  Mr. President, I would respectfully ask <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2324.008s">that</a>  this be sent to a committee of the whole meeting where we can invite the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2329.59s">It</a>  was great to have the mayor here last week to discuss some of the issues going on in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2335.552s">And</a>  so we can address the catch basins, the sidewalks, tree stumps, signage, whatever else you want to address as either part of the capital plan, either part of the surplus money we have in the water and sewer account over $8 million <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2354.456s">of</a>  ratepayer money sitting there for these type of projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2358.959s">That</a>  money's there for infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2363.582s">It's</a>  not there for a barn rating so they can say, oh, look at our barn rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2367.665s">We</a>  have a great barn rating because we have all the surplus money lying around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2371.587s">No,</a>  it's for infrastructure improvements in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2375.51s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that this be sent to a committee of the whole meeting for a further review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2383.257s">And</a>  I thank Mr. Kearns.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2385.058s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2385.838s">Is</a>  that a request or a motion Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2387.958s">I'd</a>  put in the form of a motion, Mr. President on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight with a second motion, which we'll have to take as a separate item, a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2402.022s">Uh,</a>  uh, that would have to be a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2405.303s">No,</a>  uh, no, it's the contrary motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2409.805s">There's</a>  a motion for approval of the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2411.897s">And</a>  there's a secondary motion now introduced on the floor that this paper be sent to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2420.502s">But</a>  there was no motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2421.663s">I</a>  didn't motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2424.045s">I</a>  was trying to be magnanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2425.906s">But</a>  apparently, if you want to make that a B paper, I will have to draw a motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2433.15s">Well,</a>  it's a contradictory motion to the motion that's already been introduced, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2438.714s">That's</a>  your opinion.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2442.907s">It's</a>  your opinion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2443.688s">So</a>  whatever, whatever you want to do, I, you know, I'll, I'll, I don't know if it's a matter of opinion, if it was stating two different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2454.497s">Uh,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2455.358s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2455.818s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2457.96s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2458.961s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Carnes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2460.122s">A</a>  few questions I have brought up from a few residents just a week ago is, um, the type of tree that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2470.577s">has</a>  been used in, in, in newer, um, street repairs and sidewalk repairs ended up having the same type of routing system that are now bringing up their sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2482.401s">Do</a>  you, are you familiar what kind of trees we're using?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2485.962s">Uh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2487.062s">I</a>  have the list, uh, but I don't have it with me as far as the different species of trees that are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2493.504s">Um,</a>  and, uh, you know, the ones that the arborist chooses.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2496.205s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2496.825s">I</a>  think it's important that we really stress that to the arborist, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2500.254s">because</a>  what's happening in some of the neighborhoods that have newer sidewalks, they're now starting to lift because of the old, um, what was, was told in the past, we're using a new pear tree, for instance, that the rooting system is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2514.605s">So</a>  now, uh, I think it's important that as we think forward and, and with the arborist that we're not, we're not putting ourselves in the same position we are in, in 15 years after we have this, that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2527.389s">Now</a>  we have brand new sidewalks that are popping up and replacing those. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2530.931s">I</a>  think that if we can just make sure that we have that answer for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2536.615s">And</a>  then it's something that I offered as an idea and as the acting commissioner of DPW, other communities have actual sidewalk repair teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2551.986s">And</a>  I know that I looked into a little bit of what we do every year and a year to year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2557.611s">uh,</a>  fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2558.071s">Is</a>  that something that you would entertain as our commissioner looking to bring in a few staff people with the equipment needed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2566.038s">So</a>  we don't have these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2567.239s">I</a>  know one of the issues that why this wasn't moved forward from what I was told was that the bid, the bid wasn't, it was out there for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2574.905s">People</a>  weren't actually fighting on that bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2577.828s">So</a>  that's why it took a little bit more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2579.529s">But</a>  at the same time, we, we investigated the idea of maybe bringing in our own sidewalk crew that <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2585.901s">eliminates</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2586.702s">I</a>  mean, is it something that.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2588.443s">I</a>  mean, our, our existing highway department, um, you know, I, I'll match them up to anybody's salary department.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2594.948s">I</a>  don't disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2595.668s">I</a>  think they're great, but is that enough?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2597.49s">Uh,</a>  you know, in, in public works as a whole, I mean, the men and women do monumental work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2602.614s">I</a>  agree with you a thousand percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2604.115s">The</a>  highway department would be the actual ones that would do, uh, the masonry work, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2609.079s">They</a>  do perform it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2610.84s">Uh,</a>  it's unfortunately on a very limited basis because the, you know, they're, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2615.15s">uh,</a>  responsibilities are very broad in general throughout the city, whether it be, you know, striping potholes, um, the litter baskets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2623.973s">I</a>  mean, the, the list is endless as far as what the, you know, daily duties are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2628.614s">And,</a>  you know, there was, you know, times that we were able to take on additional, uh, responsibilities like repairing a few sidewalk panels here or there, or rebuilding our, uh, uh, you know, uh, uh, ADA ramp, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2643.343s">somewhere</a>  or a couple of panels in front of a store. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2646.045s">But</a>  as far as, you know, being, uh, you know, taking on, um, the responsibility of, you know, a large scale contract, it'd be virtually impossible.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2654.771s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2654.951s">So</a>  that's, we'll get to the same point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2656.792s">I</a>  think that our DPW staff and highway staff, they're amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2660.695s">I</a>  think for what they're trying to do with the number of people that we have working, have we, would it help if we made a motion to, to ask the mayor to look into, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2671.566s">The</a>  hiring of more DPW workers for that alone, you know, the highway for sidewalk repair and catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2680.65s">I</a>  mean, it's something we can do in-house, but if we look to hire and put that in place, would that be, you know, wish list is, you know, I'm asking.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2691.434s">Oh,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2692.695s">I'd</a>  never refuse additional staffing in any area of public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2697.737s">But</a>  it certainly would, you know, accomplish things and <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2700.959s">the</a>  same time too, you could, you know, continue a program probably, you know, maybe nine months of a year, you know, of course, weather permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2710.465s">Um,</a>  so I mean, you were able, you'd be able to manage and maintain, um, you know, the constant workflow.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2716.228s">So</a>  if we can, I don't know if we can make a motion to the mayor to look into, you know, the, the practice of maybe looking into our own, um, sidewalk crew and, and, and future hiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2731.512s">through</a>  DPW and the highway department.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2733.613s">So</a>  would you like to make that an amendment to the actual motion on the floor or the contradictory motion on the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2742.036s">I'll</a>  go with both.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2743.397s">Whichever</a>  one passes, that's the motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2748.098s">Be</a>  it amended by Councilor Scarpelli, that the mayor be requested to add additional staffing to the Department of Public Works for the purpose of sidewalk repair and assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2760.838s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2762.159s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2763.54s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2764.62s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli mentioned pretty much exactly what I was going to mention. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2769.003s">You</a>  know, if we had a sidewalk department, it would be, like you said, a nine-month-a-year job because there's, I mean, you'll never ever stop fixing sidewalks.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2780.09s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2780.81s">So,</a>  I mean, for us to keep coming up every year asking for more money and asking for more money and more money, it's just, it seems like we're wasting money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2790.696s">rather</a>  than putting, I mean, how many crew would it take to actually put on a sidewalk department?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2797.32s">You</a>  would need a supervisor, a heavy equipment operator, and two, or ideally three, men that would be the refinishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2808.286s">Oh,</a>  half a dozen men would do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2810.067s">At</a>  the most, yeah, if you want to focus in on that subject.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2813.269s">We're</a>  spending $550,000 to give to another company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2814.309s">I'd</a>  rather hire our own men. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2820.224s">and</a>  have a department that we know is gonna be there next year, and they'll just constantly, that'll be their job, is fixing sidewalks, and they do nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2828.348s">I</a>  mean, it's just foolish to keep wasting money, and every year we're gonna come up, we're gonna fight every year, we need more money, I think it'll make your job a lot easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2836.552s">And</a>  we're not even talking about the manual covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2840.394s">You</a>  haven't even gone into those, and I would think those are just as bad as the catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2846.457s">And</a>  I agree with Councilor Marksley, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2849.327s">We</a>  have all that money that I don't understand why that's not being used for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2857.312s">Again,</a>  that should be a department just doing that on its own. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2862.196s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2862.776s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2863.277s">I'm</a>  not saying it's your fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2865.058s">And</a>  the guys that we have are way overworked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2869.661s">They</a>  do more than their share of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2871.782s">But</a>  extremely talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2873.263s">They're</a>  very good guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2874.124s">I've</a>  got another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2879.695s">When</a>  you take out the stumps, we leave a hole there in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2886.179s">I</a>  drive up and down the streets all the time, and I see these places where trees used to be, and they're all overgrown. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2894.623s">And</a>  I talk about how our city lacks curb appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2898.285s">That's</a>  one of the things that irks me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2899.886s">Every</a>  day I drive up and down, and I see bushes growing right on the main streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2904.969s">I'm</a>  gonna give you, for instance, where I live, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2907.583s">on</a>  the corner of Woobin and High, the bus stop, that whole, I don't know how people even get on the bus anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2914.228s">I</a>  mean, the weed's gonna be three feet high for about an eight or maybe a 10-foot stretch. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2921.973s">I</a>  mean, I don't know why somebody couldn't go by with a weed whacker and just knock them down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2927.997s">I</a>  mean, again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2928.778s">You'd</a>  be taking care of a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2931.34s">I'm</a>  not blaming you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2932.2s">Again,</a>  it goes to lack of personnel that you don't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2936.284s">There</a>  should be people that just go around doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2938.545s">I</a>  mean, let's say you drive up and down and you see that you see all the, you know, the, you see overgrowth everywhere and you can only do so much with what you get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2946.11s">And,</a>  uh, and I agree with council Scott, probably we shouldn't be requesting, we should be demanding that you get more people to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2953.994s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2956.416s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2957.536s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=2957.916s">Counsel.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3072.777s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3074.157s">So</a>  as amended by Councilor Falco on the motion for approval that the City Council receive monthly updates on the progress <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3082.971s">of</a>  said projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3084.652s">So</a>  we have before us, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3087.974s">Just</a>  briefly, just on, I think that's a great idea, Councilor Falco, and maybe take it one step further and putting it online so the residents can see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3095.818s">If</a>  we can let the residents go online and be able to look at the list and what's been removed and what's coming up, it's almost like the C-Click fix, except advance notice, and it'd be definitely helpful.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3110.325s">As</a>  amended by Vice President Longo-Khan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3113.616s">So</a>  we have before us a conundrum for me in that we have two motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3119.361s">We</a>  have one, the first motion introduced, which was a motion for approval, and that has been amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3128.93s">And</a>  then we have the contradictory motion, which is introduced that this be sent <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3134.346s">to</a>  the committee of the whole for meeting with the member. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3137.829s">So</a>  on the mayor, so on the procedure would be then to take the second one as a secondary motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3147.379s">So</a>  on that motion, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3151.903s">There</a>  was no motion to table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3153.305s">There</a>  was a motion to send a committee of the whole for meeting with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3158.369s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3159.472s">On</a>  that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3163.974s">So</a>  the motion to refer is taken first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3168.356s">So</a>  on that motion, Mr. Clerk, call the roll, please.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3359.647s">Mr.</a>  President, I think this is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3361.229s">I</a>  just think it's something that needs to be examined a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3364.591s">I</a>  certainly have no problem increasing the number of liquor licenses here in the community and approving a homeowner petition to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3370.115s">However,</a>  I'd like to take a little harder look maybe in the licensing subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3374.119s">We're</a>  increasing it by 15 licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3376.14s">That's</a>  quite a significant number. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3379.102s">It's</a>  almost 100% increase, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3381.284s">So</a>  I think it's certainly something that needs a little bit further investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3384.907s">I'd</a>  also like to have somebody from maybe the Department of Economic Development there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=3389.013s">our</a>  community development data discussed with us a little bit about the impact that these licenses will have on their ability to attract businesses to our downtown vacant storefronts.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4061.749s">It</a>  doesn't have to be right at 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4063.33s">So</a>  it's a little bit of planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4065.031s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4065.831s">And</a>  we don't know what the product would actually be for the luncheon, because we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4073.834s">Some</a>  of the people, they don't like this, and they don't like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4075.975s">And</a>  we can't do motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4077.995s">We</a>  actually can't deliver at the temple, but they do provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4082.577s">You</a>  know, you have to provide.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4125.181s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4125.781s">Back</a>  several months ago, I believe it was before budget, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4130.643s">So</a>  probably April, May, Republic Parking had sold, and the city was in negotiations with regards to the current contract we had with Republic Parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4141.285s">We</a>  had met with the mayor and the city solicitor, and I believe I began asking questions and wanting to get answers, and I think we were told it's really out of our hands because we're not the negotiating authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4153.367s">But</a>  it was in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4155.707s">It's</a>  been about four or five months now, so if we could get a written update <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4159.232s">with</a>  regards to where we're at, what changes have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4164.055s">I</a>  know that the mayor did discuss tweaks and changes in the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4170.139s">So</a>  if we could get an update, people are requesting answers from, I don't know about, from me, I don't know about the rest of the council, because people still want to see some changes with the current contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4183.448s">So</a>  if we can get an update from the city solicitor or the mayor's office, whichever, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4187.647s">seems</a>  appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4188.687s">That</a>  would be, um, of, of help to get some answers to ask citizens and to know what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4195.629s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4196.689s">Chair</a>  recognizes council Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4198.409s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4199.309s">Mr.</a>  President, this Councilor has requested on numerous occasions that the council meet with Republic and we've yet to have a meeting with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4208.631s">So</a>  I'll ask for the third time that we have a meeting, uh, and the council of the whole with Republic parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4219.837s">or</a>  the new owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4220.477s">But</a>  again, this would be the third request that I've made. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4223.518s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4224.798s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4225.118s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4227.518s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4228.058s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4228.499s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4230.319s">My</a>  name is Robert Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4231.279s">I</a>  live at zero summit road, former member of the Sargas party. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4234.62s">Uh,</a>  let's take a reflect back on what council car viola just indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4237.82s">Uh,</a>  having served on the council with your folks before it was on a couple of occasions that he pressed for the issue regarding a report forthcoming forthcoming forthcoming regarding this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4248.413s">The</a>  last one that I seem to have that's available is dated December 4th of 2015, with a breakdown which does not include December of last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4258.335s">And</a>  it's a little bit perplexing as it relates to, number one, the citations that were appealed, which were something like 3,054 year-to-date, and the citations that were dismissed, which was 1,375. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4270.198s">So</a>  almost 45 percent of the citations that were issued up until November of last year were dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4277.273s">but</a>  then you go to the issue regarding strike that hearings and year to date there was 240 hearings and of those year to date hearings, I think 88 of them were dismissed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4289.899s">The</a>  issue I think revolves around a whole host of contingencies on with this new pay to park, you can use your phone and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4298.443s">Since</a>  there is a new owner out there, I have seen certain problems that have existed personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4303.486s">Yale</a>  Street parking lot, people in the lot after six o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4306.905s">giving</a>  out tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4308.366s">Other</a>  parts of the city, the new people that have come on board with this new company, and I don't know who they are because you guys don't have a contract, you should have a copy of the contract as amended, should indicate that these folks should be aware as to what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4323.092s">Also,</a>  the fact that you can't go out there, these folks are supposed to be identified with a tag on them, with a face on their ID card, so to speak, and not something that's hidden behind their jacket or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4337.282s">and</a>  I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4338.743s">The</a>  other thing, and it's a concern, it's a bone of contention that I've had since day one, we were told during the last mayoral campaign by this mayor that seniors would be able to park for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4348.208s">What</a>  you have now is if a senior wants to park in the city, that senior has to pay $25 to have the opportunity to park for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4355.651s">They</a>  get a card or whatever it might be, and they can't transfer it to another car, because if you're a senior, and you happen to be 65, that's what they use for a standard, and 62 is social security age, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4366.73s">So</a>  why it's 65 to be a senior, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4369.572s">But</a>  if you get this little placard or whatever it might be, or sticker, you can't transfer it to another car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4374.336s">So</a>  if you're a senior driving in the city and your car is either broken down and you wanna use another car, because you are a senior, you should be able to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4382.742s">So</a>  the requirement doesn't go to the senior, apparently it goes to the car and you're stuck to that particular car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4388.647s">I</a>  think that really needs to be reviewed and looked upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4391.389s">But</a>  more importantly, I just think the statistical analysis should be forthcoming <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4395.935s">You</a>  folks had asked for a monthly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4397.956s">The</a>  last time you got it was eight months into the, nine months into the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4401.918s">It</a>  just doesn't seem right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4403.239s">My</a>  suggestion would be to have you have the new people, just like you had a Republic when they first come in, have them come and appear before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4411.383s">Air</a>  your differences with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4412.684s">Let</a>  them explain to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4414.144s">Let</a>  them explain to the public what the changes might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4417.246s">You</a>  know, it's kind of hard, you know, when people call up and they ask, you know, what can we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4421.328s">How</a>  do we make this thing better? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4424.009s">Lady</a>  comes to city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4425.638s">thinking</a>  that she can pay her ticket here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4427.679s">She</a>  can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4428.339s">And</a>  while she's here trying to pay the ticket, she's outside and she's getting a ticket on her car. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4432.64s">And</a>  she's coming in here thinking this is the way you're supposed to pay the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4435.541s">You</a>  go down the street to go to pay the ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4437.701s">And</a>  then, oh, too bad, you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4439.382s">You've</a>  got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4440.462s">You</a>  stayed here too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4441.703s">There's</a>  a whole host of issues that are still <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4443.572s">surrounding</a>  this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4444.913s">They're</a>  into the neighborhoods, where resident parking takes place, and late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4449.695s">These</a>  things are just multiplying, and nothing seems to be getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4452.716s">And</a>  if you speak to some of the business people in the square, in all the squares, they'll basically tell you that there are more spots open now than there were before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4460.119s">That's</a>  great, but their business isn't getting any much better than it was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4463.921s">If</a>  anything, it's getting less. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4465.942s">So</a>  the only reprieve that was really given during this past year is when the mayor was in, Mayor McGlynn was here, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4471.825s">And</a>  I guess he worked out a deal with Republic at that time, during the holidays, from November 4th to, I believe, January 3rd, that on the weekends, you didn't have to pay to use the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4481.27s">But</a>  that seems to be something that's not being worked out right now by this company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4485.332s">I</a>  don't know what they're going to do for the holidays this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4487.734s">It's</a>  a new company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4488.454s">They're</a>  new in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4489.635s">But</a>  I strongly suggest that you have them before you, rather than having these piecemeal approaches of people with concerns and complaints, because you really need to take a look at the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4499.08s">You</a>  really need to know what they're doing in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4501.717s">And</a>  Councilor Lungo-Koehn is right, asking for that because I think the time is near. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4505.818s">Your</a>  holidays are right around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4512.64s">Any</a>  questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4513.44s">Be</a>  more than happy to answer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4514.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4515.4s">Nice</a>  to see you all smiling tonight. <a

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4968.085s">16-705</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello be it resolved that the Medford City Council readdress the growing amount of Airbnbs in the City of Medford, impose some rules and regulations, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4977.687s">to</a>  oversee them as they are virtually untouched by all local rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4983.452s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4985.953s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4986.754s">Mr.</a>  President, this was brought up by Councilor Knight earlier in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=4992.999s">And</a>  I think if you were to go home and go to the Airbnb site and type in the city of Medford, you'd be shocked the amount of homes that are offering Airbnbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5004.0s">and</a>  you probably find a bunch in your own neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5007.181s">Many</a>  of the cities have started regulations, some have adopted them, some are in the process of doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5015.664s">I</a>  think at this point, the city of Medford should be a little proactive and develop some type of rules and regulations for them to operate if we choose that we want them to even operate in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5029.588s">I</a>  hate to see something like happen in Linfield where somebody got killed <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5033.797s">happen</a>  here in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5035.298s">So</a>  I think it's about time that we refer this to our subcommittee on ordinances or zoning, I don't know which one this would go to, to set up some type of regulations on what to do with the Airbnbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5050.551s">Would</a>  this be zoning, I think?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5053.333s">Or</a>  ordinances? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5054.133s">We</a>  can do zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5055.515s">Or</a>  ordinances, I don't know which one this would go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5056.976s">One</a>  committee, zoning ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5060.747s">Zoning</a>  in ordinances together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5061.989s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5062.349s">It's</a>  the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5063.19s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5064.371s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5065.332s">So,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, that there be a meeting of the subcommittee of zoning and ordinances to take up the issue of these internet sponsored house letting in rooming house organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5084.607s">commonly</a>  referred to as Airbnb.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5086.808s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5089.209s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5089.809s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5090.009s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5090.669s">And</a>  thank you, councilor Caraviello for keeping the conversation going on this important topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5094.891s">Um,</a>  I've been keeping a close eye on what's going on when in surrounding communities and the approach that they're taking to dealing with this type of issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5101.493s">And,</a>  um, they've been starting to designate some of these residences, accessory use residences for short term rental purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5108.705s">So</a>  communities that are authorizing and allowing Airbnbs and are regulating them by way of municipal ordinance are starting to develop a criteria on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5118.691s">It's</a>  somewhat successful in other communities and not so successful in certain communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5122.773s">So</a>  I think it's very important that we give this a long hard look, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5125.295s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper and ask that the city assessor provide us with a list of recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5131.727s">Um,</a>  because quite frankly, if a private residence is operating as a short term rental or a hotel, there is some revenue that's out there that the city should be able to capture as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5141.772s">Um,</a>  and I think that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5143.213s">I</a>  am of the position that, um, a regulation would be more beneficial to the community and to our city and to our consumers than an outright ban. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5151.797s">Um,</a>  some of my colleagues on the council may disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5153.718s">So</a>  I think the subcommittee is a great place to start with this so that we can make some recommendations, um, conduct some, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5159.035s">interviews</a>  and get further educated on the topic before we move into creating some legislation, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5164.477s">Thank</a>  you, Chairman Knight of Zoning and Ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5169.918s">So</a>  on the motion as amended, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5172.299s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5172.659s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5173.739s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5174.479s">7.04</a>  offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5178.1s">Be</a>  resolved that the bus stop sign that was knocked down be put back at the correct location of 213A Mills XF. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5186.543s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5188.641s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5189.881s">It</a>  was about three years ago I was contacted by a number of business owners at that stretch of Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5198.203s">Anyone</a>  familiar with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5199.363s">There</a>  used to be a bus stop that stretched about six car lengths in front of the businesses, and it took up a majority of the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5209.565s">We</a>  got together with the T, along with the business owners, and we narrowed the space where the bus can stop to pick up some additional spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5218.057s">Just</a>  recently, a car knocked down the bus sign that was erected on a single pole, and the T erected the sign back at the old location. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5230.845s">So</a>  it took us almost two years to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5233.547s">We're</a>  back at step one again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5235.308s">So</a>  I would ask that the T look at their records, Mr. President, and relocate the bus stop sign in front of 213A <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5245.398s">Middlesex</a>  ave where it was voted on and approved for relocation back some two or three years ago.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5255.607s">And</a>  that paper is going to be sent to the mbta division of bus stops locations, yes?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5265.156s">I</a>  haven't had much success with them but if that's where it goes, that's where it goes.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5270.083s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5270.804s">Do</a>  we have a representative? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5272.265s">Do</a>  we have a representative to the T point of information council Scott?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5276.668s">I</a>  think we can actually just one name that's been receptive anyways, uh, Dan fielding department of transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5283.773s">I</a>  think he has a direct line to the T if we can.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5286.955s">So</a>  maybe, maybe if we could send it to him as well, CC it to Dan.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5290.638s">We'll</a>  end up sending it to Brian short director, general manager, and then I'll copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5299.444s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5300.944s">That'd</a>  be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5302.265s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5306.688s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5309.81s">Carries.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5310.711s">Citizen</a>  wishes to make a brief commercial announcement at the podium to announce honoring veterans and DAV 5K race. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5321.758s">Madam</a>  Citizen.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5322.928s">Thank</a>  you, Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5325.509s">Thank</a>  you for letting me speak and announce this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5329.49s">There</a>  will be a breakfast on November 11th at 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5334.391s">at</a>  the First Baptist Church, 29 Oakland Street, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5339.093s">And</a>  let me just tell you a little bit briefly about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5342.874s">The</a>  church bell tower was first dedicated to 13 men and one woman who died in World War II. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5348.383s">from</a>  the congregation of the First Baptist Church in 1948. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5351.485s">The</a>  bells have been recently refurbished, and the congregation would like to once again honor veterans with the patriotic music from these bells. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5361.269s">A</a>  short performance of this music will occur as veterans congregate on the steps of the church at 9 AM, followed by an honorary breakfast. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5368.973s">Please</a>  join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5370.434s">That's</a>  right here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5372.713s">There's</a>  no reason why everybody can't be there, veterans and their families, and especially any widows or spouses, family members, because kids suffer too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5385.884s">Especially</a>  with this generation, I hear a lot of kids that have to move from place to place and change school to change school when their fathers and mothers are in the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5395.842s">If</a>  you're a child of a veteran, please come too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5400.245s">And</a>  then the DAV 5K, if you don't mind, it's a run to honor veterans and you can go to DAV5K.org and you can find out all about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5410.711s">One</a>  of the things that they want to stress is if you have a track team in your high school, so Medford High, get the track team involved, go to DAV5K.org and get signed up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5422.437s">If</a>  you can't run, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5424.164s">Like</a>  me, I'm going to volunteer, but you can sponsor somebody with money to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5429.65s">And</a>  it's going to be advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5430.711s">There's</a>  going to be an RKO spot the whole day before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5434.695s">There's</a>  a lot of money being poured into the city for it and everything, so you'll hear about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5439.02s">But</a>  just so that you can sign up early, it's the DAV 5K. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5443.645s">It's</a>  going to be at Castle Island in South Boston.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5446.109s">Great</a>  location for a run.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5448.61s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5449.931s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5451.091s">That's</a>  November 11th at 9 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5453.812s">And</a>  I know that they're going to have something at the VFW at 11 as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5457.834s">So</a>  you can go, you can hop from one to the other.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5462.455s">Thank</a>  you very much, Jean. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5463.536s">Thank</a>  you for your advocacy for our veterans.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5466.197s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5468.998s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5469.698s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5470.859s">If</a>  I may, before the minutes, make a quick announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5474.0s">Please</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5474.807s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5475.788s">Uh,</a>  this is just to remind everyone, uh, uh, earlier this year, I had a motion about moving the community police meetings, uh, the monthly meetings out to the neighborhoods and tomorrow night the, uh, Medford police department's community service meeting will be at, uh, the Brooke school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5493.661s">Um,</a>  and that's going to be at 7 PM and everyone is welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5497.123s">You</a>  don't have to live in that neighborhood to go to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5499.685s">Anyone</a>  from all over the city is welcome to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5502.833s">to</a>  talk about issues related to the police and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5506.476s">So</a>  it starts at 7, over at the Brooks Elementary School.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5510.079s">7</a>  o'clock, Brooks Elementary School, Medford Police Community Meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5513.562s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco, for your diligent work in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5518.006s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5518.487s">Bringing</a>  the police to every neighborhood of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5521.77s">Well,</a>  actually, Mr. President- Sector by sector.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5524.632s">If</a>  I may, actually, while we're here, just to reiterate that, I guess, <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5529.367s">So</a>  tomorrow night is the Brooks Elementary School. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5531.048s">November</a>  2nd is St. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5532.37s">Francis</a>  Parish Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5535.472s">December</a>  7th, Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5537.914s">And</a>  January 4th is going to be in South Medford, most likely at the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5542.198s">I</a>  just have to confirm that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5543.679s">But</a>  those are the dates moving forward over the next four months where the community, Medford Police Department community meetings are being held. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5551.085s">So</a>  everyone is welcome to attend.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5552.747s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5553.247s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5553.627s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5554.988s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5555.649s">And</a>  the records. <a href="https://youtu.be/2SyhnAlrcqY&t=5557.386s">are</a>  being passed to Councilor Falco for approval.</p>
