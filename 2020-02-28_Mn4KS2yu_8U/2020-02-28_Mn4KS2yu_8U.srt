[SPEAKER_26]: And if you run and you don't designate a school or a club or a team, that goes into a pool

39
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:26,449

[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

67
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:09,558
[SPEAKER_26]: We had 668 runners that had registered for this race.

68
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:12,760
[SPEAKER_26]: And of course, it poured like insane.

69
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,263
[SPEAKER_26]: But we still had 400 and something people show up in the torrential rain.

70
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,687
[SPEAKER_26]: And first place had the most runners was Roberts with 128.

[SPEAKER_26]: Joseph's with 87.

00:06:24,369 --> 00:06:25,089
[SPEAKER_26]: And the highest

75
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:31,454
[SPEAKER_26]: And I forgot the trophies.

76
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:33,275
[SPEAKER_26]: They're in the Roberts again.

77
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:38,699
[SPEAKER_26]: We give a trophy for the school that has the most runners and the school that raises the most money.

78
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:42,081
[SPEAKER_26]: And for the last, like, three years, I think the Roberts has won.

79
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:45,864
[SPEAKER_26]: And Ellen and Courtney Sharon, I hear, to represent the Roberts.

80
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:46,985

[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

85
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:14,526
[SPEAKER_26]: I think this is our seventh race, and I think we've raised almost $200,000 for the schools on this.

86
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:17,087
[SPEAKER_26]: So hopefully every year we'll get bigger and better.

87
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:18,107
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,501

[SPEAKER_19]: You and your team just do a fabulous job.

95
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:45,391
[SPEAKER_19]: The amount of money that was raised and has been raised consecutively.

96
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:47,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have a total for all the years?

97
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:47,192
200,000.

98
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:49,433
[SPEAKER_19]: 200,000.

99
00:07:49,373 --> 00:07:49,433
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow.

100
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Wow, that's just fabulous.

101
00:08:05,566 --> 00:08:06,508

[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham.

00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:13,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Am I good?

104
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:13,711
[SPEAKER_22]: Am I on?

105
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,333
[SPEAKER_22]: I also wanted to say thank you.

106
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:20,875
[SPEAKER_22]: This year in particular, I know it was a real team effort.

107
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:25,358
[SPEAKER_22]: We called in reinforcements from all over the place to make this race happen.

108
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:39,426
[SPEAKER_22]: And there were lots of folks who jumped in, some of whom don't even have children in our schools, like Lauren Felch and a number of other folks who really, really stepped forward to make this happen and really bolster the team this year.

109
00:08:39,466 --> 00:08:41,027
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanted to say a special thank you

110
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,757
[SPEAKER_22]: all the people who made this year's race in particular happen.

111
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:45,537
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

112
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:45,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

113
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:57,745
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, from the chair, I also want to thank Judy and Justin and the team and the PTOs and everybody from the schools who participated.

114
00:08:58,398 --> 00:09:06,600
[SPEAKER_16]: To have over 400 people running in that rain is a testament to how great of a race it is and the community spirit.

115
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,541
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole race, I just followed my son, who found the biggest puddles that he could find.

116
00:09:13,181 --> 00:09:17,102
[SPEAKER_16]: It was probably the grossest race I've ever run, but it was still fabulous.

117
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:18,983
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for all you do for our community.

118
00:09:19,543 --> 00:09:19,803
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

119
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:25,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Superintendent.

120
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:33,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to say thank you to all the participants and thank you for continuing to have this great race on behalf of our schools.

121
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,321
[SPEAKER_08]: We're very appreciative.

122
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:35,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

123
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:47,624
[SPEAKER_16]: While we're under suspension, we have Miss Julie Matariz who is here to announce Rare Disease Day, which is February 29th, 2020.

124
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:57,173
[SPEAKER_27]: Hello.

125
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:59,695
[SPEAKER_27]: Hi, I'm Megan, and I'm Emily's sister.

126
00:10:00,675 --> 00:10:04,497
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you for letting me speak to you about Rare Disease Day.

127
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:08,558
[SPEAKER_27]: There are over 7,000 rare diseases identified.

128
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:10,839
[SPEAKER_27]: Emily has one.

129
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,902
[SPEAKER_27]: She was the only one born in 2003 to be born with one in Massachusetts.

130
00:10:18,442 --> 00:10:19,403
[SPEAKER_27]: She has galactosemia.

131
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:26,014
[SPEAKER_27]: You can only get it if both your parents have dormant gene that matches up at conception.

132
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:34,179
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a one in four chance, which is just a large word that means her body cannot break down the sugar that is in milk.

133
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:39,622
[SPEAKER_27]: There is no cure, but we are lucky that all she has to do is follow a milk-free diet.

134
00:10:41,103 --> 00:10:49,908
[SPEAKER_27]: If she does not follow the diet, the milk sugars will build up and she'll get cataracts, and it will cause her kidneys and liver to shut down.

135
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,234
[SPEAKER_27]: Every person with glaucoma is different.

136
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:57,016
[SPEAKER_27]: Some don't have any complications besides a diet.

137
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,557
[SPEAKER_27]: My sister has a lot of them.

138
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:06,020
[SPEAKER_27]: Hand tremors, speech apraxia, intellectual disabilities.

139
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,821
[SPEAKER_27]: She also has some medical issues.

140
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:10,943
[SPEAKER_27]: At the moment, there is no cure, but they are working on one.

141
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:16,306
[SPEAKER_27]: I just really thank you for wearing a ribbon and supporting her so she knows we all care.

142
00:11:18,627 --> 00:11:18,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

143
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:30,732
[SPEAKER_27]: In the envelopes, there is a blue ribbon that says Emily and Galactus see me on it.

144
00:11:31,832 --> 00:11:34,454
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a blue ribbon, yep, save this for February 29th, right?

145
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,115
[SPEAKER_27]: 28th and 29th.

146
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:40,677
[SPEAKER_16]: 28th and 29th, and we'll be lighting up City Hall blue in honor of this special day.

147
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, great job.

00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:17,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Megan, being a sibling of an individual with a disability can sometimes be challenging because sometimes you don't always get the attention that other people do.

150
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:21,762
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's really remarkable that you were able to come up tonight and speak on behalf of your sister.

162
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:12,018
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

163
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:20,866
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd like to ask my two teachers who were involved in our first set of awards, the Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Awards, to join me tonight.

164
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:24,427
[SPEAKER_24]: We had four teachers involved, but two of whom were able to attend tonight.

165
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:26,508
[SPEAKER_24]: So if Mr. Ambrose and Ms.

00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:28,089
[SPEAKER_24]: I believe Ms.

168
00:13:28,109 --> 00:13:28,649
[SPEAKER_24]: McGinnis and Ms.

169
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:30,890
[SPEAKER_24]: Sanford are not here, but please feel free to come up.

170
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,493
[SPEAKER_24]: The first set of awards is the Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Awards.

171
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:41,495
[SPEAKER_24]: These awards are an important opportunity for students to be recognized for their creative talents.

172
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:57,080
[SPEAKER_24]: There were over 2,000 Massachusetts students entering the Boston Globe Scholastic Writing Awards this year, and I'm very pleased to announce that Medford had six Scholastic Writing honorees, two gold keys, two silver keys, and two honorable mentions.

173
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:00,503
[SPEAKER_24]: All winners receive a certificate for each award.

174
00:14:01,384 --> 00:14:07,270
[SPEAKER_24]: Gold and silver keys will also receive a pin, and they will be honored at Tufts University on March 14th.

175
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:16,194
[SPEAKER_24]: Also, gold key winners actually, their pieces are digitally sent to New York and they are entered into a national competition.

176
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:23,179
[SPEAKER_24]: So we're thrilled to have all of our winners and the two gold key winners will move on to the New York competition.

177
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,542
[SPEAKER_24]: We are very proud of all students that entered.

178
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:31,266
[SPEAKER_24]: It is not easy to enter your writing pieces and to share a piece of that with you.

179
00:14:31,687 --> 00:14:33,248
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'd like to thank again, Ms.

180
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:34,549
[SPEAKER_24]: McGinnis, Ms.

181
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,471
[SPEAKER_24]: Zekman, Mr. Ambrose, and Ms.

182
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:36,931
[SPEAKER_24]: Sanford

183
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:41,139
[SPEAKER_24]: as well as all of the students who worked closely with them.

184
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:50,988
[SPEAKER_24]: Not every student could be here tonight, because as you can imagine, they're involved in multiple activities, but they're very excited to have their name read on the television as well.

185
00:14:51,128 --> 00:14:53,790
[SPEAKER_24]: So with that, I think we begin with the gold key winners.

186
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:55,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Read as best as I can.

187
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:56,192
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

188
00:14:56,212 --> 00:15:04,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of the, yeah, Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Sophia Hernandez for winning

189
00:15:13,987 --> 00:15:17,649
[SPEAKER_16]: for winning the Gold Key Scholastic Writing Awards for 2020.

190
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,411
[SPEAKER_16]: All the school committee is listed and signed.

191
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:35,758
Congratulations, Sophia Garcia.

192
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,579
[SPEAKER_16]: Nertha Richards.

193
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Sophia, Sophia, congratulations.

194
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:45,397
[SPEAKER_16]: Nertha Richards is not here, we'll get that to her.

195
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:48,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Catherine Schmidt.

196
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Kenza Belula.

197
00:16:50,185 --> 00:16:51,466
[SPEAKER_16]: would you like to announce the other awards?

198
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:54,888
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I think you have two more honorable mentions there for Rachel Myers.

199
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:56,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yes.

200
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:58,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Catherine Schmidt.

201
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

202
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Honorable mention, Scholarship Writing Award 2020, Rachel Myers.

203
00:17:22,648 --> 00:17:24,949
[SPEAKER_16]: And another honorable mention for Catherine Smith.

204
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:26,069
[SPEAKER_16]: So double.

205
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:41,253
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

206
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:42,633
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you so much.

207
00:17:42,693 --> 00:17:43,133
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

208
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:44,053
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

209
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:45,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

210
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:45,894
[SPEAKER_24]: Moving right along.

211
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:51,355
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, the next award for humanities is the English speaking unions, Shakespearean monologue competition.

212
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,393
[SPEAKER_24]: Medford High School is very proud to have participated in this competition.

213
00:17:56,214 --> 00:18:04,581
[SPEAKER_24]: There was a round that was held at the school level, and from here, the champion progresses to the state semifinals as Medford's representative.

214
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:13,589
[SPEAKER_24]: In the semifinals, the winner delivers a monologue and a sonnet, and entrants come from public and private schools throughout the state.

215
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:18,053
[SPEAKER_24]: Students are assessed on understanding, delivery, and audience engagement.

216
00:18:19,528 --> 00:18:25,293
[SPEAKER_24]: And this year, we had our representative advance from the semifinals to the finals, which is an amazing accomplishment.

217
00:18:25,694 --> 00:18:32,340
[SPEAKER_24]: And in the finals, this student became one of the top five high school Shakespearean performers in Massachusetts for this school year.

218
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,402
[SPEAKER_24]: Please join me in congratulating him.

219
00:18:37,044 --> 00:18:37,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

220
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:39,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Nicholas Urasco.

221
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:56,366
[SPEAKER_24]: I also failed to mention that Mr. Bowen Flynn was the teacher who really supported him throughout this competition.

222
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,007
[SPEAKER_24]: So a thank you to Mr. Bowen Flynn who could not be with us tonight.

223
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:05,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. member Rousseau.

224
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,170
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

225
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:13,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I, I, when I read the list of the, uh, the titles of the pieces, I'm always like,

226
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:14,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

227
00:19:14,382 --> 00:19:15,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't I have a copy?

228
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:16,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we get a copy of the pieces, please?

229
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:17,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

230
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:25,512
[SPEAKER_24]: What we first do is we make sure that the parents sign off and that the student signs off just to make sure that they want to share it with everyone.

231
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:27,274
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have a specific permission slip.

232
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:28,735
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's coming out absolutely.

233
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:32,798
[SPEAKER_24]: And then what we also like to do is publish it on our website as well once they do that.

234
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:33,339
[SPEAKER_24]: So yes.

235
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:33,719
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.

236
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,520
[SPEAKER_24]: Every year we'll get that.

237
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,841
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for reminding me of that.

238
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:37,302
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

239
00:19:37,382 --> 00:19:40,325
[SPEAKER_24]: Last but not least is Medford High School's Mock Trial Team.

240
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:44,566
[SPEAKER_24]: And tonight, we have the mock trial team advisor, Ms.

241
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:47,086
[SPEAKER_24]: McMahon, along with Attorney Rumley.

242
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:50,087
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'd like to invite them both to join me, if that's OK?

243
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:50,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

244
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:00,729
[SPEAKER_24]: A little background on Medford's Mock Trial.

245
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:05,069
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a competition with other Massachusetts high schools.

246
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,370
[SPEAKER_24]: This is open to students in grades 9 through 12.

247
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:11,924
[SPEAKER_24]: And students learn a variety of skills.

248
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:16,248
[SPEAKER_24]: They gain public speaking skills, they gain debating skills, analytical skills.

249
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:23,495
[SPEAKER_24]: At the end of each competition, and there were three that our students engaged in, they do receive a verdict from the judge.

250
00:20:23,635 --> 00:20:26,558
[SPEAKER_24]: But that is not how they win the competition.

251
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:34,645
[SPEAKER_24]: They instead have to attain a series of points in a variety of categories, including points for their opening statement,

252
00:20:35,237 --> 00:20:42,039
[SPEAKER_24]: points for their closing argument, points for direct examination, cross-examination, and even witness performance.

253
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,442
[SPEAKER_24]: This year, our mock trial team participated in three competitions, all of which were held at Waltham District Court.

254
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:53,543
[SPEAKER_24]: At the first trial, Medford prevailed 88 to 73.

255
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:59,145
[SPEAKER_24]: During the second trial, we narrowly lost to Winchester High School with a score of 81 to 77.

256
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:03,547
[SPEAKER_24]: But they did end their season with a third victory of 106 to 97

257
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:08,716
[SPEAKER_24]: Excuse me, 106 to 97.

258
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:09,916
[SPEAKER_24]: Ms.

259
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:12,777
[SPEAKER_24]: McMahon is the hardworking advisor of this team.

260
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:20,339
[SPEAKER_24]: She supports the students tirelessly as they work on the variety of categories that I just listed.

261
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:28,181
[SPEAKER_24]: We also had Attorney Mark Rumbley, Attorney Elise Copley, and Attorney Robert Gilligan assist the students this year.

262
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:34,122
[SPEAKER_24]: They helped build their case, helped them interpret the case analysis, as well as the federal and state laws.

263
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:37,131
[SPEAKER_24]: and we are very grateful for their dedication and support.

264
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:42,515
[SPEAKER_24]: I know that they wanted to say something quickly, and then we have a list of students to recognize.

265
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:43,716
[SPEAKER_24]: Sounds great.

266
00:21:45,497 --> 00:21:46,078
[SPEAKER_24]: One person wants to speak.

267
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

268
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:58,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to make this comment that for almost 40 years, I represented the city of Medford at all different levels, from the district court to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.

269
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:03,211
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, being part of the mock trial team and helping

270
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:06,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Dana, but I did very little help with her.

271
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,757
[SPEAKER_00]: She prepared this team so well.

272
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:16,242
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been as proud as a group of youngsters in Medford, and they competed in this, and it wasn't just about the law.

273
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:32,875
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an element of theatrics, there's an element of public speaking, but most importantly, there's an element of not being afraid to stand up and be afraid to present and to succeed and to know that success is always on the other side of resistance.

274
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,456
[SPEAKER_00]: This team was especially competent.

275
00:22:35,756 --> 00:22:38,438
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so proud of them, and I just wanted to say those words.

276
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:51,126
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have to point out that the administration and Dana McMahon, the faculty consultant on this, they trusted her and she drew the best out of each performance.

277
00:22:51,726 --> 00:22:58,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to be part of it, and I think the city should know what great competition and great students we have.

278
00:22:59,171 --> 00:22:59,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

279
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:06,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

280
00:23:07,569 --> 00:23:07,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

281
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:08,589
[SPEAKER_16]: Emily Gatti.

282
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:14,512
[SPEAKER_24]: She's busy doing something else probably very important.

283
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:14,852
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

284
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:17,133
[SPEAKER_24]: Isabella Batty.

285
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Juliette Franks.

286
00:23:41,466 --> 00:23:42,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Yousef Jahad.

287
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:51,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Lisa Lopez.

288
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:10,496
[SPEAKER_16]: Body Hung.

289
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:19,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayesha Vertilis.

290
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:38,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Christina Zhang.

291
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:46,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Abby Zawakil.

292
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:04,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Arthur Shillerman.

293
00:25:12,356 --> 00:25:15,261
[SPEAKER_16]: And last but not least, Mishka Durali.

294
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:37,201
[SPEAKER_24]: A special thank you to all of you for supporting these students in their endeavors.

295
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:37,721
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

296
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:38,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, thank you.

297
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:02,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on project 351 by Mr. Nicholas Tucci and Michael Downs, our two principals from the middle schools.

298
00:26:13,462 --> 00:26:13,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

299
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:36,273
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good evening Medford School Committee.

300
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:49,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my pleasure to be here this evening to speak to you about the involvement of two of our middle school students in Medford who participated in last month's Project 351 launch day on Saturday, January 18th in Boston.

301
00:26:51,233 --> 00:27:02,616
[SPEAKER_02]: 8th grade McGlynn Middle School student Sophia Hernandez and 8th grade Andrews Middle School student Jackson Olander were nominated by their teachers and selected by their principal to represent our community.

302
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:10,139
[SPEAKER_02]: These 8th grade students who represented Medford were chosen on the basis of Project 351's core values of their ambassadors.

303
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,179
[SPEAKER_02]: There are four core values.

304
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:17,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Kindness, the quality of being friendly, generous, considerate, and warm toward others.

305
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:25,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Compassion, the instinct to care deeply about others through the greater understanding of their life story and circumstances.

306
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:32,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Humility, the characteristic of being modest, especially when using one's power for the good of the community.

307
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:38,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And gratitude, the quality of being thankful, demonstrating appreciation and kindness with joy.

308
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:57,306
[SPEAKER_28]: According to Project 351's mission, they seek to develop the next generation of community first service leaders through customized service learning, hands-on community building, and values based on leadership training.

309
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:22,563
[SPEAKER_28]: Both Sophia and Jackson had a wonderful experience on the launch day at Faneuil Hall in Boston, where they got a chance to hear Governor Baker address the young leaders, perform acts of community service, and engage in interactive leadership activities, all designed to develop their leadership skills to one day uplift, unite, and transform the communities in which they live.

310
00:28:23,323 --> 00:28:26,544
[SPEAKER_28]: We look forward to supporting their leadership projects this school year.

311
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:34,651
[SPEAKER_28]: At the same point in time, I'd like to turn it over to Sofia Hernandez and Jackson Orlando, who will share some of their experiences.

312
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:43,494
[SPEAKER_02]: And first, I'd like to introduce Sofia Hernandez, 8th grader at the McGlynn Middle School, who'd like to go through a little brief presentation with a few PowerPoint slides.

313
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:44,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Sofia.

314
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:45,595
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

315
00:28:46,835 --> 00:28:46,995
[SPEAKER_12]: So,

316
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:56,481
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just gonna be a wrap up of like my day and everything.

317
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:09,073
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was dropped off at my regional place and we went to Faneuil Hall and then we were sent to our volunteer stations and we got back at the JFK Library.

318
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:11,596
[SPEAKER_12]: We had like a late reception and then we went home.

319
00:29:12,477 --> 00:29:13,098
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah.

320
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:16,854
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is a picture of everyone this year.

321
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:24,280
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all the 351 cities in the Commonwealth District.

322
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:30,524
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is just like, I was really, really nervous when I got at my bus stop.

323
00:29:30,604 --> 00:29:36,468
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know what to do, and I soon made a lot of friends, and we went on our way.

324
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:43,137
[SPEAKER_12]: I got at Faneuil Hall and everyone was so kind.

325
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:47,161
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember there was lines of people with smiles and high fives.

326
00:29:47,562 --> 00:29:51,786
[SPEAKER_12]: I was so nervous to meet everyone, but I soon settled in.

327
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:54,329
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a picture of Faneuil Hall.

328
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Inside Faneuil Hall,

329
00:29:57,765 --> 00:29:59,985
[SPEAKER_12]: This is where the kickoff started.

330
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:09,407
[SPEAKER_12]: I met everyone, and we learned a special handshake, and we learned the core values, unite, act, lead, and I really took that with me throughout the day.

331
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:23,590
[SPEAKER_12]: We heard everyone speak from Celtics players to the governor, and we learned about six-word memoirs, which were honoring our service leaders, and then we went

332
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:27,591
[SPEAKER_12]: on the bus for our volunteer stations.

333
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:31,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, this is just a picture of the governor speaking.

334
00:30:31,952 --> 00:30:34,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Just people, that's the governor up there.

335
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,873
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the choir.

336
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:48,036
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so there were multiple volunteer stations from the Greater Boston Food Bank to the Pine Street Inn in Boston.

337
00:30:48,676 --> 00:30:52,037
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was located in Cradles to Crayons in Brighton.

338
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,051
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just a picture of all the locations.

339
00:30:56,751 --> 00:31:09,838
[SPEAKER_12]: So at Cradles to Crayons, this is a nonprofit organization, and they make packs for underprivileged citizens, especially homeless children.

340
00:31:10,518 --> 00:31:15,000
[SPEAKER_12]: And they include everything from clothes to toys to books.

341
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,602
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was so fulfilling just to know that I was helping someone.

342
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:21,988
[SPEAKER_12]: This is inside and everything.

343
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:25,749
[SPEAKER_12]: This is learning how to make the packs.

344
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,710
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see a little more inside.

345
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:31,772
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is just a quote they have that really resonated with me.

346
00:31:31,792 --> 00:31:36,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was in the library.

347
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,114
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't really see that.

348
00:31:37,154 --> 00:31:39,395
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was making book packs for kids.

349
00:31:40,535 --> 00:31:42,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, this is just inside.

350
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:44,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is everyone who was stationed there.

351
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,019
[SPEAKER_12]: This is my service group.

352
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,180
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a lot of pictures, okay.

353
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,121
[SPEAKER_12]: Then we met back at the JFK Library, and we just talked about everything, and it was amazing.

354
00:31:56,822 --> 00:31:59,182
[SPEAKER_12]: We learned about how many people we impacted.

355
00:31:59,682 --> 00:32:01,883
[SPEAKER_12]: So in, how many people was it?

356
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:02,903
[SPEAKER_12]: It's crazy.

357
00:32:02,983 --> 00:32:10,345
[SPEAKER_12]: So in total, we helped 46,000 people, and that was just like in an hour.

358
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:13,606
[SPEAKER_12]: In Cradle to Crayons, I can tell you all the numbers, it was 1,088.

359
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:20,090
[SPEAKER_12]: The homeless shelter, Pine Street Inn, it was 1,343.

360
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,230
[SPEAKER_12]: The food bank, 11,777.

361
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:23,873
[SPEAKER_12]: You get the point.

362
00:32:23,913 --> 00:32:26,314
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just crazy how much people we helped.

363
00:32:27,736 --> 00:32:31,278
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just at the JFK library, and we were just talking.

364
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,061
[SPEAKER_12]: This is really nice.

365
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,402
[SPEAKER_12]: We just talked with everyone.

366
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:42,670
[SPEAKER_12]: The theme was good trouble, and I couldn't believe how much good trouble we created that day.

367
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,091
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we just said goodbye and went home.

368
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:46,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

369
00:32:47,312 --> 00:32:49,733
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just a picture inside with my friend.

370
00:32:49,753 --> 00:32:50,733
[SPEAKER_12]: That was some cupcakes.

371
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:52,754
[SPEAKER_12]: I like that picture, and that's the end.

372
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:54,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

373
00:32:59,393 --> 00:33:11,815
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just say to wrap up for Sophia, Sophia does plan to kick off her Cradles to Crayons initiative here in the city of Medford at the Wizards versus the middle school teachers basketball game on Thursday, March 12th.

374
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:16,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd invite the community to participate and help out Sophia with her initiative in the city of Medford.

375
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:16,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

376
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:20,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's my pleasure to turn it over to Jackson Olander at the Andrews Middle School.

377
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:27,438
[SPEAKER_17]: What was that?

378
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:36,228
[SPEAKER_06]: So, walking into this, I was completely terrified.

379
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,772
[SPEAKER_06]: The true beginning of this incredible experience was when I was called down to Mr. Downs' office.

380
00:33:43,677 --> 00:33:46,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't think I had done anything wrong.

381
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:53,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember walking down the 8A hallway wondering what on earth could have landed me there.

382
00:33:53,621 --> 00:34:00,384
[SPEAKER_06]: I can count on one hand the amount of times I had been sent to the principal's office before this, so I had no idea what was going to happen.

383
00:34:01,444 --> 00:34:07,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, the walk was short, so I didn't have too much time to ponder my imminent demise.

384
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:14,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I sat down and Mr. Downs told me the basics behind the organization and asked if I was interested in serving.

385
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:16,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I said, okay.

386
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:19,534
[SPEAKER_06]: And so began my relationship to Project 351.

387
00:34:21,155 --> 00:34:25,077
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Jackson Olander and I am a Medford Ambassador to Project 351.

388
00:34:26,038 --> 00:34:30,120
[SPEAKER_06]: On January 18th, I had the privilege to attend Launch Day 2020.

389
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:35,784
[SPEAKER_06]: I truly believe I walked out of those doors a different person than when I entered.

390
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:46,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Going in, I had no idea of what to expect, but I know for a fact that what occurred on that launch day exceeded any possible expectations I could have had.

391
00:34:47,507 --> 00:34:53,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's impossible to truly do this amazing project justice, but I'm going to try to do so.

392
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:01,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Upon entering this massive room, I was sat in a group of other eighth graders who looked just as alarmed as I did.

393
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:08,759
[SPEAKER_06]: We listened to short speeches from our peers and from the people we wish to emulate as we get older.

394
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,502
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was riveted.

395
00:35:11,862 --> 00:35:14,445
[SPEAKER_06]: This beginning to our launch day was inspiring.

396
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:16,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It made me want to help the world.

397
00:35:16,627 --> 00:35:21,452
[SPEAKER_06]: These inspiring people believed in us, believed in the change young people can make in the world.

398
00:35:22,093 --> 00:35:23,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And that feeling was incredible.

399
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:29,806
[SPEAKER_06]: From there, we went to the truly amazing part of launch.

400
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:34,309
[SPEAKER_06]: We were divided into our service teams to go perform service in various locations.

401
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:40,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Each team was named after a well-known figure who dedicated themselves to service.

402
00:35:41,152 --> 00:35:48,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I was assigned to the Pete Freight Service Team in honor of the man who created the Ice Bucket Challenge to raise money and awareness for ALS.

403
00:35:50,097 --> 00:35:56,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Our group, along with several other service teams, went to UMass Boston to help prepare food for families and schools in need.

404
00:35:57,093 --> 00:36:00,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Each group was placed making packaged soup mix to bag and send.

405
00:36:01,315 --> 00:36:06,377
[SPEAKER_06]: The mix, when added to boiling water, would make a filling, nutritious meal.

406
00:36:07,037 --> 00:36:11,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Our group of seven filled about six boxes of 72 packages each.

407
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:18,022
[SPEAKER_06]: After about three hours of this, we were sent to the JFK library to learn about our spring service project.

408
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:24,374
[SPEAKER_06]: The truest experience was the emotions brought from doing service.

409
00:36:24,575 --> 00:36:28,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I will never be able to fully explain the feelings that came with this work.

410
00:36:29,257 --> 00:36:32,298
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a fulfillment and a deep joy.

411
00:36:32,698 --> 00:36:40,582
[SPEAKER_06]: In this environment, I felt for the first time in my life that I was doing something monumental that truly affected our community.

412
00:36:41,323 --> 00:36:45,945
[SPEAKER_06]: In a few hours, our service team helped to feed thousands of people across Massachusetts.

413
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:52,207
[SPEAKER_06]: In all, the entire 2020 class of ambassadors fed and clothed almost 46,000 people.

414
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:55,788
[SPEAKER_06]: The experience was unreal.

415
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:59,609
[SPEAKER_06]: What stuck with me most was the connection I made with the other ambassadors.

416
00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:06,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone there had a different story, entirely different lives that likely would never have crossed otherwise.

417
00:37:06,511 --> 00:37:09,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But for a few hours, we were connected and close.

418
00:37:10,332 --> 00:37:15,073
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter what background a person came from, you knew that they were there because of a love of service

419
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:18,290
[SPEAKER_06]: and a driving passion to change the world.

420
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:24,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that connection and that understanding drove us to be better and to bring out the best in each other.

421
00:37:25,294 --> 00:37:30,537
[SPEAKER_06]: The joy that came with serving alongside these people has been unparalleled in everything I've done since.

422
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:36,641
[SPEAKER_06]: What comes next is our spring service led by ambassadors across Massachusetts.

423
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:42,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Every ambassador who registered will participate and drives across the state to benefit Cradles to Crayons.

424
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:45,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Project 351 will be heavily involved in these drives.

425
00:37:45,836 --> 00:37:52,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Once a week, registered ambassadors will participate in conference calls to learn techniques and strategies for running their drives.

426
00:37:53,140 --> 00:38:00,083
[SPEAKER_06]: They will also receive packages to assist their efforts with frequently asked questions, alumni advice, and other essential assets.

427
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:06,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Downs has already allowed me to begin planning a donation drive at the Andrews, which I have very high hopes for.

428
00:38:06,986 --> 00:38:10,108
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I will also run drives at two other locations in Medford.

429
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:15,784
[SPEAKER_06]: The Dance Haven and Salem Street Studios are both communities that I am deeply connected to.

430
00:38:16,344 --> 00:38:21,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Both have large clienteles of caring families and the three are relatively close together for easier collection.

431
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:31,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to host events at these locations to raise money for the purchase of new clothes to donate in addition to the gently used clothes that will be donated.

432
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:38,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I plan to partner with Sophia Hernandez on this drive, and we are currently planning on where and when to host events and drives.

433
00:38:38,638 --> 00:38:41,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, I am very excited about these drives.

434
00:38:41,399 --> 00:38:45,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Medford can do a lot to help people, and I am thrilled to be a part of that effort.

435
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:50,880
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are interested in donating, I will give you the information for these drives as plans are finalized.

436
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I will do my best to keep residents of Medford notified of any and all events for this service.

437
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:01,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time, and thank you for taking such an interest in this project.

438
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:13,428
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

439
00:39:13,448 --> 00:39:14,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

440
00:39:19,613 --> 00:39:22,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Suspension for... Oh, yes.

441
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,863
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to thank the two student ambassadors for your presentation.

442
00:39:30,883 --> 00:39:31,824
[SPEAKER_19]: It was great.

443
00:39:32,264 --> 00:39:35,087
[SPEAKER_19]: You joined a long list of

444
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:40,131
[SPEAKER_19]: watched with pride when our students have been selected.

445
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,812
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a big deal to be selected from your school.

446
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:52,358
[SPEAKER_19]: And we are grateful for how well you represented us already on the special day and your work in the future.

447
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,180
[SPEAKER_19]: We expect to see a lot of you, and let us know if we can help.

00:40:07,647 --> 00:40:13,008
[SPEAKER_16]: While we're under suspension, we're gonna take negotiations and legal matters.

451
00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:17,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a motion?

452
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:20,789
[SPEAKER_16]: It's executive session.

453
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:23,630

[SPEAKER_18]: McLaughlin.

460
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:55,559
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

461
00:40:55,759 --> 00:40:56,660
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

462
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,201
[SPEAKER_16]: We have approval of the minutes of February 3rd, 2020.

463
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:10,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Ruseau.

464
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:11,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

465
00:41:11,683 --> 00:41:21,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, on page two, it's not actually anything that needs to be changed, but there is the motion to, we did vote to create an advisory committee.

466
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:22,925
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to

467
00:41:23,628 --> 00:41:36,233
[SPEAKER_07]: work with the superintendent to do that, unless the superintendent is, I don't, we don't really have a lot of, I don't have a lot of experience with us creating these things, so I don't know who was really supposed to take the lead in actually finding people.

468
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:37,694
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this for the task force, food?

469
00:41:38,194 --> 00:41:39,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly, yes.

470
00:41:39,995 --> 00:41:50,719
[SPEAKER_16]: My office is gonna be putting together a committee, so we have the task force up with the Board of Health, and we're gonna be putting together a committee, and we'll make sure there's a member of the school committee on that committee, if that's amenable.

471
00:41:51,043 --> 00:41:56,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, this does require that there's at least one teacher, administrative and nursing representative, adjustment Councilor.

472
00:41:57,344 --> 00:42:08,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this could certainly be part of that, but I just feel like the recommendations within the school system will be so, I don't want to say, it'll be more focused.

473
00:42:08,847 --> 00:42:10,427
[SPEAKER_07]: More focused on the schools?

474
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:14,868
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we could do one through superintendent and one through my office for the city side.

475
00:42:15,528 --> 00:42:20,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have a strong preference, but I do think that if we're pulling in these people through the schools,

476
00:42:20,548 --> 00:42:25,170
[SPEAKER_07]: then they're probably going to want to meet during school time at the schools, which wouldn't work well.

477
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we can definitely do that.

478
00:42:27,331 --> 00:42:27,391
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

479
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:34,834
[SPEAKER_16]: We can even advertise together and then separate the applications so we can get a good pool of people interested if we want to do it that way.

480
00:42:34,854 --> 00:42:35,074
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

481
00:42:35,134 --> 00:42:37,075
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm happy to advertise through a press release.

482
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,656
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, roll call vote on the minutes.

483
00:42:39,676 --> 00:42:41,256
[SPEAKER_16]: I actually didn't have a question.

484
00:42:41,276 --> 00:42:42,237
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, yeah.

485
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:42,937
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

486
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:44,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you.

487
00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:52,417
[SPEAKER_15]: I also had a question on the committee of the whole meeting that we had talked about scheduling for the students.

488
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:58,684
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering if that's been scheduled for the student issue that was before us last time.

489
00:42:58,705 --> 00:42:59,025
[SPEAKER_15]: Minimum wage.

490
00:42:59,246 --> 00:43:02,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that was scheduled for March 4th at 4 p.m.

491
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,931
[SPEAKER_16]: We're gonna do a walkthrough of the high school, then we're gonna sit down and meet on the minimum wage.

492
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:08,033
[SPEAKER_16]: 4 o'clock on March 4th.

493
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:13,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And did anybody notify the... No, that hasn't been... It hasn't been officially posted yet.

494
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:18,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I just did the... To all members of Save the Day.

[SPEAKER_08]: You will.

499
00:43:22,676 --> 00:43:22,756

[SPEAKER_16]: Before every school committee meeting, we will meet in Committee of the Whole, it will be televised, and we will meet at 5.30 to go through every department so that we can

00:45:58,945 --> 00:46:07,572

559

[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

560
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:23,766
[SPEAKER_07]: On page six, there's a mention that we have, there's pothole funding, I just hate that it's called pothole funding, because it's not for potholes, coming in for charter reimbursements, and I was just curious if the city had received that funding already or not.

561
00:46:23,946 --> 00:46:25,527
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really come to us in the schools,

562
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:30,860
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on the third paragraph of page six.

563
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:36,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure personally if we've received it yet, but I will look into that.

00:46:36,623 --> 00:46:36,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

565
00:46:37,944 --> 00:46:38,264

[SPEAKER_16]: That's OK.

573
00:46:54,702 --> 00:46:56,323
[SPEAKER_21]: Just one of those times.

574
00:46:57,103 --> 00:46:58,384

575
00:46:58,864 --> 00:47:02,645

[SPEAKER_16]: Curriculum subcommittee, enhanced core reading instruction, ECRI, and planning for future meetings, 2-5-20.

577
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:17,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we want to suspend, before we go on to this order of business, do we want to suspend the rules and continue our meeting?

578
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,991
[SPEAKER_19]: What would you like to suspend the rules for?

579
00:47:20,051 --> 00:47:22,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Right, because this is going to take some time to read it all.

580
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:23,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

581
00:47:24,143 --> 00:47:33,956
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules so we can pick up the two departments that were not heard yet from our pre budget meeting.

582
00:47:35,058 --> 00:47:35,999
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, motion.

583
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:40,434
[SPEAKER_16]: to suspend the rules by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member McLaughlin.

584
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:41,254
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

585
00:47:41,694 --> 00:47:41,754
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

586
00:47:41,854 --> 00:47:42,694
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

587
00:47:43,534 --> 00:47:52,356
[SPEAKER_16]: When we were in our committee, the whole meeting this evening, we've got through almost all the budget outlines.

588
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,417
[SPEAKER_16]: We have two remaining that we need to finish.

589
00:48:00,498 --> 00:48:04,079
[SPEAKER_16]: So we will call up our director of science.

590
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:22,255
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not sure if it's, okay, it is on.

591
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:22,736
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening.

592
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:29,107
[SPEAKER_29]: And I just wanted to take a moment to say hello.

593
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:37,548
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a new school committee line up for me and I see some new members and some people that I've met before.

594
00:48:38,209 --> 00:48:43,354
[SPEAKER_29]: Congratulations and it's a pretty exciting time because it's my first time in front of you all.

595
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:51,422
[SPEAKER_29]: The science budget for the upcoming school year includes some payments for the FOSS program.

596
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:54,584
[SPEAKER_29]: which is $69,750 of the total $180,000 that we're proposing.

597
00:48:54,604 --> 00:48:59,047
[SPEAKER_29]: That is the second payment and it's 25% of the program and it will go on for the next school year as well.

598
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:02,248
[SPEAKER_29]: It has really, I think, been a

599
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:22,378
[SPEAKER_29]: Big change for the elementary schools, the K-5 program, and also a welcome change by many of the teachers.

600
00:49:23,578 --> 00:49:36,947
[SPEAKER_29]: We see them really working with the materials that are part of the program, and the students are really engaged essentially 100% of the time in any class that I walk in.

601
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:43,452
[SPEAKER_29]: One in particular, earlier in the year, I went into Roberts Elementary classroom, and

602
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:47,229
[SPEAKER_29]: this particular classroom has newcomers come in.

603
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:54,014
[SPEAKER_29]: And there was a student there that had only been in class for three days or two days.

604
00:49:55,055 --> 00:50:12,769
[SPEAKER_29]: And the student had a notebook, was prepared with all the materials, was illustrating because, again, it's a newcomer class in the fourth grade, and it was an incredible sort of like

605
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:15,152
[SPEAKER_29]: experience for the child.

606
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:25,742
[SPEAKER_29]: And it has what we call a low bar, but a really high ceiling for kids to be able to explore science.

607
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:28,084
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's a great program.

608
00:50:28,545 --> 00:50:34,150
[SPEAKER_29]: And I was so excited to see that particular student really be able to get into the

609
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:36,552
[SPEAKER_29]: the curriculum.

610
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:42,154
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's replicated class after class after class, no matter where you go, it's always the same.

611
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:47,256
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're going to continue supporting teachers with that program.

612
00:50:47,856 --> 00:50:51,958
[SPEAKER_29]: They will need to continue to purchase some smaller items that are listed there.

613
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:58,701
[SPEAKER_29]: We have to replace vinegar and plaster of Paris and paper products, sand and dirt, and also

614
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:05,941
[SPEAKER_29]: make sure that the living samples that will be needed for next year are covered.

615
00:51:06,262 --> 00:51:21,005
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's 12,400, which gives us about $100 per grade level per school in addition, and then the rest would be for classroom, for the living materials.

616
00:51:21,805 --> 00:51:27,827
[SPEAKER_29]: That cost could come down, it just depends on what the cost of living materials are at the given time that we have to purchase them.

617
00:51:29,558 --> 00:51:34,182
[SPEAKER_29]: At the middle level, we're really looking currently at a new program.

618
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:41,207
[SPEAKER_29]: We anticipate being able to propose some program.

619
00:51:41,227 --> 00:51:43,228
[SPEAKER_29]: We're looking at two specifically right now.

620
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:49,833
[SPEAKER_29]: We finished up a pilot of a program called iQuest, which is part of Activate Learning.

621
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:54,316
[SPEAKER_29]: It's similar to the FOSS program, but it is

622
00:51:55,937 --> 00:52:00,981
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a more robust and deep project that's related to the new frameworks.

623
00:52:02,142 --> 00:52:15,453
[SPEAKER_29]: And then the next one began, it probably is beginning this week or started the week before February break, just in terms of training time and the materials arrival at middle schools.

624
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,651
[SPEAKER_29]: and that one is called STEMscopes.

625
00:52:20,232 --> 00:52:26,736
[SPEAKER_29]: All the teachers have the material, not all of the teachers, I shouldn't say, pilot teachers have those materials and they're piloting those two programs at the moment.

626
00:52:27,276 --> 00:52:32,759
[SPEAKER_29]: So we'll be able to give you some more information about which one might be a better fit for Medford at that time.

627
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:38,302
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm really just giving you an estimated cost of $45,000 right now.

628
00:52:38,662 --> 00:52:43,925
[SPEAKER_29]: As a placeholder, I'm not sure what the cost will be annually for that program at the moment.

629
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:45,586
[SPEAKER_29]: It depends on which one we go with.

630
00:52:47,160 --> 00:53:02,524
[SPEAKER_29]: and also at the high school level, we are having a curricular change which will help us get more electives for students in grades 11 and 12.

631
00:53:03,164 --> 00:53:06,145
[SPEAKER_29]: In order to do that and keep all of the

632
00:53:07,913 --> 00:53:25,049
[SPEAKER_29]: Desi requirements and the MCAS in mind, we're stepping away from introductory physics, moving in biology as a ninth grade course, moving in chemistry as a tenth grade course, and then they could take electives, eleventh and twelfth grade.

633
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:41,262
[SPEAKER_29]: In order to do that, it would make a lot of sense to purchase new biology texts to cover that, and there's a placeholder for $45,000 in the textbook line for that.

634
00:53:42,523 --> 00:53:51,310
[SPEAKER_29]: It could come down, again, we're gonna look at different texts, but we're really looking at texts in that case with an online component.

635
00:53:53,071 --> 00:53:53,911
[SPEAKER_29]: not a program.

636
00:53:54,512 --> 00:53:56,973
[SPEAKER_29]: The curriculum itself is really robust.

637
00:53:57,033 --> 00:54:05,778
[SPEAKER_29]: The teachers work extremely hard in creating units of instruction that are coherent and connected to the frameworks.

638
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:12,622
[SPEAKER_29]: This is really a resource to use so that students can find some of the biology content in that area.

639
00:54:15,407 --> 00:54:27,597
[SPEAKER_29]: There's also $7,500 allocated to make sure that classroom supplies and consumables are present for the department, which is about where we are annually for the high school.

640
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:40,628
[SPEAKER_29]: That includes all of the chemicals that we might need in a particular year and also their classroom supplies that they would need for the high school, 9 through 12.

641
00:54:43,814 --> 00:54:53,800
[SPEAKER_29]: We also ask for $500 for the office, and that includes office supplies, folders, binders, things of that nature for the office.

642
00:54:56,041 --> 00:55:08,829
[SPEAKER_29]: All in all, I think we're making some forward motion in two key areas, at the middle school and at the high school, which were really needed, and I think it's gonna open up a lot of things in the future for the kids.

643
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:10,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

644
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:11,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

645
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:14,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for this report.

646
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Very helpful.

647
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:16,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice to meet you.

648
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:35,178
[SPEAKER_15]: I am wondering about... I loved how you described the low bar but high ceiling for the science curriculum and I know that science is really often a core topic that is available to all of our learners, especially with the project-based learning, hands-on, experiential.

649
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:47,541
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering if there are supplemental aspects to the curriculum for both our EL and our children with special education needs, so our access programs, our language-based classrooms.

650
00:55:48,027 --> 00:55:59,377
[SPEAKER_29]: So, some of the materials, when FOSS was designed by the University of California, Berkeley, they took into consideration a lot of the pieces that are very tactile.

651
00:55:59,417 --> 00:56:08,664
[SPEAKER_29]: So, all of the materials that are there, they really took into consideration students with disabilities and that had maybe, you know,

652
00:56:09,645 --> 00:56:16,809
[SPEAKER_29]: challenges to picking up certain types of tools and also visually impaired students.

653
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:28,656
[SPEAKER_29]: So some of the devices actually have like you can feel where the quantities are rather than just see it visually and students would be able to access the materials.

654
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:38,102
[SPEAKER_29]: So we've deployed enough materials to cover every grade level and every classroom at every school

655
00:56:39,222 --> 00:56:44,083
[SPEAKER_29]: for three years, and that includes both the permanent and the consumable materials.

656
00:56:45,143 --> 00:56:52,044
[SPEAKER_29]: It was an enormous purchase, and we can also add in things to that.

657
00:56:52,424 --> 00:56:56,405
[SPEAKER_29]: It also provides online components that are not subscription-based.

658
00:56:56,485 --> 00:57:02,246
[SPEAKER_29]: It's all included in the price that we paid, and we also got the living animals.

659
00:57:02,306 --> 00:57:06,307
[SPEAKER_29]: Living animals are a little bit of a challenge in some classrooms versus others,

660
00:57:06,747 --> 00:57:17,475
[SPEAKER_29]: But there will be enough around that we can definitely make some attempts at seeing what would be possible in different environments.

661
00:57:18,015 --> 00:57:24,040
[SPEAKER_29]: The FOSS group is really helpful in giving us some guidance on that as well.

662
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:32,486
[SPEAKER_29]: So as we train teachers and talk about those different areas, we'll be able to increase our reach into those classrooms.

663
00:57:33,115 --> 00:57:33,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

664
00:57:33,495 --> 00:57:34,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for considering that.

665
00:57:34,516 --> 00:57:35,056
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate it.

666
00:57:35,096 --> 00:57:42,759
[SPEAKER_15]: And for the home-based, I mean, for the technology access, is there home access also?

667
00:57:43,939 --> 00:57:44,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

668
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:57,384
[SPEAKER_29]: So there's home access by student and there's, we haven't like activated it necessarily, but it's completely accessible by every student in any environment, whether they're at school at home.

669
00:57:57,604 --> 00:57:57,724
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

670
00:57:57,984 --> 00:58:02,266
[SPEAKER_15]: So families watching should know that they have online access to the science curriculum.

671
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:02,706
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

672
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:03,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

673
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:04,147
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

674
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:04,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Very helpful.

675
00:58:05,207 --> 00:58:05,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

676
00:58:05,708 --> 00:58:06,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

677
00:58:07,268 --> 00:58:08,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for the report, Mrs. Seery.

678
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:12,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a question about one of the wish list items.

679
00:58:12,231 --> 00:58:12,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

680
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:15,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was, there was zero costs associated with it.

681
00:58:16,052 --> 00:58:17,753
[SPEAKER_09]: The high school engineering course.

682
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:18,193
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

683
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,775
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if you could go over that a little bit.

684
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:21,255
[SPEAKER_29]: Sure.

685
00:58:21,395 --> 00:58:25,217
[SPEAKER_29]: So currently we have a robotics and engineering program at the high school.

686
00:58:26,037 --> 00:58:28,559
[SPEAKER_29]: at the vocational side of the house.

687
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:43,571
[SPEAKER_29]: They're building a new space and it will allow us to sort of allow electives to be part of the mix for students at the high school but also give credit to students that are in the vocational program to be able to use that.

688
00:58:43,631 --> 00:58:44,932
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's a no-cost item.

689
00:58:44,972 --> 00:58:45,712
[SPEAKER_29]: It's basically

690
00:58:46,553 --> 00:58:53,495
[SPEAKER_29]: we give permission to say this is possible and we start to find ways of enrolling students into the program.

691
00:58:53,875 --> 00:59:01,718
[SPEAKER_29]: Right now, we think we have enough staffing to be able to support a section of this kind of thing.

692
00:59:03,178 --> 00:59:09,460
[SPEAKER_29]: If the need rises and we need more staffing, we'll start considering it as we roll out the new program.

693
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,000
[SPEAKER_29]: the new curriculum.

694
00:59:11,341 --> 00:59:12,821
[SPEAKER_29]: So we think we're good.

695
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:14,542
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't need any extra.

696
00:59:15,382 --> 00:59:20,845
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a free item I thought you should know and it's just a quick change that can be made for kids.

697
00:59:21,788 --> 00:59:23,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it sounds fantastic.

698
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:27,272
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen the new space and it's beautiful.

699
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:29,433
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really big.

700
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:37,538
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much to learn and I'm sure Mr. Chrissy would love to have the students in his classroom and he loves teaching everybody.

701
00:59:37,818 --> 00:59:40,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So is this definitely going to happen as an elective?

702
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:47,945
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, so Mr. Chrissy's been in the conversation as has Mr. Fallon, so this is an unknown territory at this point.

703
00:59:48,545 --> 00:59:58,671
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sort of formalizing it for you that you know sort of the direction we're heading with the engineering and what we think would be really helpful as an added piece.

704
00:59:59,472 --> 01:00:00,112
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

705
01:00:00,733 --> 01:00:01,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Van der Kloot.

706
01:00:03,157 --> 01:00:07,819
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Seary, I just want to go back to the issue of the ninth grade biology.

707
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,921
[SPEAKER_19]: So of course, as you know, for many, many years, biology was the ninth grade subject.

708
01:00:13,482 --> 01:00:23,946
[SPEAKER_19]: And in fact, the physics was changed to the ninth grade subject because of the fact that the students needed to take a ninth grade

709
01:00:24,406 --> 01:00:31,291
[SPEAKER_19]: science MCAS and it was thought that the physics was more approachable maybe or whatever.

710
01:00:32,372 --> 01:00:35,134
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, I'm glad to see biology coming back.

711
01:00:35,194 --> 01:00:36,996
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it fits well in the ninth grade.

712
01:00:37,056 --> 01:00:39,458
[SPEAKER_19]: I think all students should be able to take it then.

713
01:00:39,978 --> 01:00:48,324
[SPEAKER_19]: But I am wondering about the change of thinking about will the students then take the biology MCAS in ninth grade?

714
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:48,925
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

715
01:00:49,698 --> 01:00:53,261
[SPEAKER_29]: So all students would be taking the ninth grade biology MCAS.

716
01:00:53,481 --> 01:01:03,769
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, and so will our teachers who were teaching biology in an upper grade now come teach it to ninth graders?

717
01:01:03,809 --> 01:01:03,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

718
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:07,252
[SPEAKER_19]: And will the physics

719
01:01:09,214 --> 01:01:12,377
[SPEAKER_19]: Will there still be that introductory physics, or will physics be left?

720
01:01:12,397 --> 01:01:17,422
[SPEAKER_29]: No, the physics is going to be a 11th, 12th grade elective.

721
01:01:17,662 --> 01:01:22,827
[SPEAKER_29]: So we're not jettisoning the course itself, or the materials, or the investment.

722
01:01:23,187 --> 01:01:28,913
[SPEAKER_29]: But we are going to ramp it up so that the mathematics of that course is appropriate to the students at the level.

723
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:34,317
[SPEAKER_29]: We've seen a lot of different solutions to this.

724
01:01:34,397 --> 01:01:37,119
[SPEAKER_29]: We think this is the one that will work for our students.

725
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:43,483
[SPEAKER_29]: Earth science was the first course and we had earth science and then honors biology.

726
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:49,227
[SPEAKER_29]: We replaced earth science with introductory physics and left biology as an honors course.

727
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:55,792
[SPEAKER_29]: I thought leaving and the faculty sort of agrees at this point with the changes in the framework.

728
01:01:56,192 --> 01:02:02,354
[SPEAKER_29]: that biology is doable completely by ninth graders and that we can move forward.

729
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:08,215
[SPEAKER_29]: In the future, as we look at chemistry, this is an area where we'll have to work really diligently.

730
01:02:09,056 --> 01:02:13,677
[SPEAKER_29]: We've embraced the chemistry course as a faculty to look at it and try to make it

731
01:02:14,822 --> 01:02:16,223
[SPEAKER_29]: approachable for a 10th grader.

732
01:02:16,263 --> 01:02:18,986
[SPEAKER_29]: That's really the, that will be our big challenge.

733
01:02:19,226 --> 01:02:22,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Will we have any earth science course at all offered?

734
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:23,430
[SPEAKER_29]: Any earth science?

735
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:23,610
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

736
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:24,871
[SPEAKER_29]: It can be open to that.

737
01:02:25,071 --> 01:02:33,799
[SPEAKER_29]: So once the elective world is open for us to be able to put in other courses, we can add in things that we think we can support, such as an earth science course.

738
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:35,580
[SPEAKER_29]: We have environmental science.

739
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:37,382
[SPEAKER_29]: We have anatomy and physiology.

740
01:02:37,802 --> 01:02:41,325
[SPEAKER_29]: We're sort of double use of engineering.

741
01:02:41,385 --> 01:02:46,649
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's going to open up all those courses and allow more students to access elective courses.

742
01:02:46,669 --> 01:02:49,210
[SPEAKER_19]: And this change will happen in September?

743
01:02:49,371 --> 01:02:49,711
[SPEAKER_29]: Correct.

744
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:51,512
[SPEAKER_19]: September 2020.

745
01:02:52,153 --> 01:02:57,217
[SPEAKER_19]: That's with relatively quick, but I imagine that your staff is all on board for this?

746
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:57,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

747
01:02:58,037 --> 01:02:58,798
[SPEAKER_29]: They're ready to go.

748
01:02:59,018 --> 01:02:59,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

749
01:02:59,919 --> 01:03:00,199
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

750
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:01,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham.

751
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:02,760
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

752
01:03:03,181 --> 01:03:03,901
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

753
01:03:05,502 --> 01:03:11,505
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to say thank you for the work that you've been doing to pilot FOSS in particular.

754
01:03:11,525 --> 01:03:26,693
[SPEAKER_22]: I had the opportunity to sit in on some of the early conversations when teachers were looking at various curricula and I just really commend the process and the engagement from teachers across the entire district.

755
01:03:26,753 --> 01:03:27,313
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think

756
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:46,613
[SPEAKER_22]: that that has served us well, because what I hear come back from my kids is real excitement about science, and I sort of wish I got to learn science that way, because as it stands, I'm not allowed to teach science in my home, because I'm unqualified, so I might drop in for a science class or two.

757
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:52,978
[SPEAKER_22]: And then one question that I had on the budget was,

758
01:03:53,618 --> 01:03:57,640
[SPEAKER_22]: I was surprised to see that the consumables cost was so low, frankly.

759
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:06,405
[SPEAKER_22]: To be bringing in living organisms and all kinds of other things, that's not a lot of money across such a big swath of classrooms.

760
01:04:06,665 --> 01:04:06,985
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.

761
01:04:07,265 --> 01:04:12,528
[SPEAKER_29]: So the costs are based on estimates that were provided by the vendor.

762
01:04:13,248 --> 01:04:18,231
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's certainly within the ballpark of what we think it will cost.

763
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:27,979
[SPEAKER_29]: There are some cost savings that can be done if we deliver in bulk and then, you know, I put all the animals in my car and take them to the schools.

764
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:30,341
[SPEAKER_29]: It's actually kind of a fun thing to do.

765
01:04:30,401 --> 01:04:35,966
[SPEAKER_29]: It sounds a little weird, but it's really fun to deliver live crayfish to schools and classrooms.

766
01:04:36,346 --> 01:04:38,028
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm looking forward to that part.

767
01:04:38,388 --> 01:04:40,369
[SPEAKER_29]: And it does provide a little cost savings.

768
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:44,632
[SPEAKER_29]: So the arrival of the organisms is something that we will anticipate.

769
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:46,013
[SPEAKER_29]: It's going to be fun.

770
01:04:46,473 --> 01:04:48,295
[SPEAKER_29]: It's an exciting moment for the kids.

771
01:04:48,595 --> 01:04:54,319
[SPEAKER_29]: And if we coordinate it right, there will be some cost savings if we get them delivered in bulk.

772
01:04:54,359 --> 01:05:01,784
[SPEAKER_29]: So, you know, it sounds like a lot or a little, but the kits also included like three years worth of consumables.

773
01:05:01,824 --> 01:05:05,006
[SPEAKER_29]: So at some point we're going to have to like re-up and I'll come back.

774
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:06,327
[SPEAKER_29]: But right now we're good.

775
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:07,005
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

776
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:12,173
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the other just point of context for the people in the audience.

777
01:05:12,754 --> 01:05:14,998
[SPEAKER_22]: We sort of made reference to a wish list.

778
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,707
[SPEAKER_22]: All of the departments have been asked to identify three to five initiatives.

779
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:24,258
[SPEAKER_22]: that if funded would positively impact student achievement.

780
01:05:25,178 --> 01:05:26,339
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's a mouthful.

781
01:05:26,439 --> 01:05:28,621
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's sort of been abbreviated to wish list.

782
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:35,467
[SPEAKER_22]: And so all of the departments are providing the school committee really for the first time an articulation of what those things are.

783
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:37,949
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for doing that.

784
01:05:38,029 --> 01:05:40,912
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's super nice to be able to grant $0 wishes.

785
01:05:41,012 --> 01:05:42,053
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you for that too.

786
01:05:43,774 --> 01:05:45,195
[SPEAKER_22]: That was the best wish so far.

787
01:05:46,756 --> 01:05:48,438
[SPEAKER_21]: But I like them all, actually.

788
01:05:48,538 --> 01:05:49,839
[SPEAKER_21]: I like all of your wishes.

789
01:05:49,919 --> 01:05:51,600
[SPEAKER_21]: But that one's an easy one.

790
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:52,581
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

791
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:53,641
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

792
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:54,262
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

793
01:05:54,422 --> 01:05:54,922
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate it.

794
01:05:55,543 --> 01:06:00,266
[SPEAKER_16]: We have World Language Department presented by Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli.

795
01:06:01,547 --> 01:06:06,691
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is page 18 on your budget.

796
01:06:06,711 --> 01:06:08,292
[SPEAKER_16]: 18 of 28.

797
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:16,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm going to ask the lead teacher for the department, Vilma B. Bowe, to be up here with me.

798
01:06:17,866 --> 01:06:22,249
[SPEAKER_05]: I will deliver the report, but certainly she's available for questions as I am.

799
01:06:24,411 --> 01:06:25,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here to present...

800
01:06:26,572 --> 01:06:32,377
[SPEAKER_05]: on the World Language Department, and I have been covering this department now for a year and a half.

801
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:43,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I was asked to cover in this role after the retirement of Mrs. DiCarlo, who was the foreign language director at that time.

802
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:46,549
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, we have changed the name of the department to World Language.

803
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:51,513
[SPEAKER_05]: We think it reflects and embraces all that we are here in Medford.

804
01:06:52,747 --> 01:06:53,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll start with staffing.

805
01:06:54,688 --> 01:06:59,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a total of 19 educators in the department.

806
01:06:59,671 --> 01:07:02,552
[SPEAKER_05]: We have three elementary paraprofessionals.

807
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,034
[SPEAKER_05]: We have five middle school teachers.

808
01:07:05,494 --> 01:07:10,617
[SPEAKER_05]: One of those teachers travels back and forth to each of the two middle schools.

809
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:13,178
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are two and a half at each middle school.

810
01:07:14,026 --> 01:07:16,127
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 11 high school teachers.

811
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:21,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of those teachers have abbreviated schedules.

812
01:07:21,549 --> 01:07:23,430
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two lead teachers.

813
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:28,052
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mrs. Bebo is one, so she teaches an abbreviated schedule.

814
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:31,553
[SPEAKER_05]: She does a lot of, she helps me with the department.

815
01:07:33,054 --> 01:07:39,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also have the lead teacher for the CCSR, even though CCSR is not my department.

816
01:07:39,777 --> 01:07:42,318
[SPEAKER_05]: The teacher that does CCSR is

817
01:07:42,865 --> 01:07:48,768
[SPEAKER_05]: a Spanish teacher in the department and associated with the CCSR.

818
01:07:50,449 --> 01:08:00,074
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have one vocational section that is taught, one vocational online Spanish section taught by a math teacher.

819
01:08:01,472 --> 01:08:02,913
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to be upfront with that.

820
01:08:03,873 --> 01:08:06,495
[SPEAKER_05]: That teacher did have room in her schedule.

821
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:11,978
[SPEAKER_05]: That teacher is a native Spanish speaker.

822
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:17,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So she very graciously offered to teach one of our online sections.

823
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:25,700
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to start with our elementary level, because we do have some significant news to report.

824
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:42,005
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you know, CASET, which is an organization that supports Italian language in Massachusetts, they're actually based in Wakefield, has received notice from the Italian government.

825
01:08:42,045 --> 01:08:49,628
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Italian Consulate, actually the Italian Consulate through the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

826
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,827
[SPEAKER_05]: that Cassett has lost its funding.

827
01:08:52,188 --> 01:09:01,155
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why this is significant is because for the past 20 plus years, Cassett has supported our elementary Italian program by contributing $50,000.

828
01:09:02,016 --> 01:09:05,278
[SPEAKER_05]: That money has been taken away.

829
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:10,322
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it was late, mid to late January when we were informed that that happened.

830
01:09:10,703 --> 01:09:12,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is effective immediately.

831
01:09:12,604 --> 01:09:15,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only does that affect the elementary Italian program,

832
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:27,530
[SPEAKER_05]: But also, Casset was funding some of the AP exams that I believe Maureen Lavin brought up earlier, the decrease in the number of AP exams, because Casset was funding.

833
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:32,411
[SPEAKER_05]: We were actually encouraging junior students in Italian to take those AP exams.

834
01:09:33,031 --> 01:09:44,914
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've also, in the past, funded a number of contests that have already begun, and with the abrupt ending of the funding, we are trying to reach out to other sources to fund those contests that were promised to the students.

835
01:09:46,221 --> 01:10:09,927
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are we are disappointed again for 20 plus years we have taught students in Medford Italian in grades 2 through 5 and There are three I'll call them teachers, but they are paraprofessionals They've been with us and actually Vilma started off in Medford as one of the Cassett teachers She's now one of obviously our full-time teachers, but that's where she got her start.

836
01:10:10,568 --> 01:10:11,548
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it is

837
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:19,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a wonderful opportunity for our students, it's just unfortunate that we've lost the funding for that.

838
01:10:19,722 --> 01:10:26,351
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll be happy to answer questions at the end of the report regarding

839
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:28,938
[SPEAKER_05]: regarding that issue.

840
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:42,601
[SPEAKER_05]: At the middle school level, one of the improvements that we made this year is that in grade six, and along with the cooperation of the middle school principals, each student in grade six has their language three times a week.

841
01:10:42,721 --> 01:10:44,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to this year, it was twice a week.

842
01:10:44,502 --> 01:10:46,743
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do see an improvement in that area.

843
01:10:47,163 --> 01:10:51,324
[SPEAKER_05]: In grade seven and eight, they also have their language three times a week.

844
01:10:51,364 --> 01:10:55,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So all middle school students who take a language meet three times a week.

845
01:10:56,273 --> 01:10:58,535
[SPEAKER_05]: French is not offered in the middle school.

846
01:10:58,595 --> 01:11:09,002
[SPEAKER_05]: That was taken away about, I'm guessing, 14 or 15 years ago with the retirement of at least one teacher who taught French in that level.

847
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:13,646
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are only two options in middle school.

848
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:19,490
[SPEAKER_05]: At the high school level, students may opt to study French, Italian, or Spanish.

849
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:25,661
[SPEAKER_05]: We do see that French is at a disadvantage because they're not coming in with the French background.

850
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:38,887
[SPEAKER_05]: So just jumping forward to the wish list, I would eventually like to see French be offered as an option on the middle school level to put it on equal ground with the other two languages.

851
01:11:41,867 --> 01:11:50,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to the high school level, so it is a requirement on the high school side of the house for students to take two years of a language.

852
01:11:51,812 --> 01:12:01,778
[SPEAKER_05]: On the vocational side, it is highly encouraged, and if a student wants to pursue a college route, it is particularly encouraged.

853
01:12:02,038 --> 01:12:05,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It's encouraged for everybody, but colleges do look for that.

854
01:12:07,341 --> 01:12:09,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the schedule is prohibitive,

855
01:12:10,503 --> 01:12:16,528
[SPEAKER_05]: to offering language to grades 10, 11, and 12 students.

856
01:12:16,988 --> 01:12:20,671
[SPEAKER_05]: We do offer an online language program for vocational students.

857
01:12:21,151 --> 01:12:25,334
[SPEAKER_05]: We have had, I think, some real successes with that.

858
01:12:25,354 --> 01:12:28,276
[SPEAKER_05]: The teacher, we have two teachers.

859
01:12:28,436 --> 01:12:34,161
[SPEAKER_05]: One is the math teacher I spoke about, and then we have a full-time language teacher who really works wonders with those students.

860
01:12:34,681 --> 01:12:35,822
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a hybrid.

861
01:12:35,842 --> 01:12:38,444
[SPEAKER_05]: She does meet with them in addition to doing the online work.

862
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:53,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Vilma has been really busy with our Seal of Biliteracy program, and in fact, under Rita DeCarlo, when she was doing her practicum, she is the one who approached Rita to bring it to Medford, so we did it.

863
01:12:54,007 --> 01:12:55,348
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the initial year.

864
01:12:55,808 --> 01:13:00,671
[SPEAKER_05]: She worked on it last year, and now Vilma is doing a lot of work on the Seal of Biliteracy this year.

865
01:13:01,071 --> 01:13:08,716
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, I probably should turn it over, because you know so much more about the Seal of Biliteracy and all of the steps involved.

866
01:13:08,756 --> 01:13:10,297
[SPEAKER_05]: So did you want to say a couple of words about

867
01:13:11,309 --> 01:13:11,869
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're doing.

868
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:13,571
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

869
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:18,015
[SPEAKER_01]: The Syllable Lyrics is a wonderful program.

870
01:13:18,055 --> 01:13:21,399
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the third year that we implemented in Medford.

871
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:33,511
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beauty of this program is that it's open to any student, all seniors, to see if they're proficient in another language other than English.

872
01:13:34,391 --> 01:13:50,640
[SPEAKER_01]: other than English, and if they do reach that proficiency by taking this test that we offer, the student gets in his or her diploma a transcript, the biliteracy, that he or she is biliterate in another language other than English.

873
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:52,361
[SPEAKER_01]: than English.

874
01:13:52,421 --> 01:13:54,002
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been highly successful.

875
01:13:54,363 --> 01:13:58,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year we had several students that reached the state sealed biliteracy.

876
01:13:59,766 --> 01:14:05,611
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year I have 54 students taking the sealed biliteracy starting this Wednesday.

877
01:14:06,732 --> 01:14:15,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have nine students that take in two languages, either Italian or Chinese or French or Portuguese or Portuguese and Spanish and so on and so forth.

878
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:17,479
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a wonderful program.

879
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:20,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

880
01:14:21,261 --> 01:14:29,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Vilma has also been working on bringing national honor societies in Spanish, French, and Italian to the school this year.

881
01:14:29,683 --> 01:14:33,124
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is our first year bringing in those national honor societies.

882
01:14:33,624 --> 01:14:47,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And she also has been instrumental in organizing the World Language Festival, which I believe the school committee has been invited to, as has the whole school community, which will take place on March 6th of this year.

883
01:14:47,128 --> 01:14:48,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're very excited about that.

884
01:14:50,511 --> 01:14:58,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Jumping forward here to the wish list items, I mentioned reintroducing French on the middle school level.

885
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:05,504
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the difficulties would be licensure for a teacher.

886
01:15:06,185 --> 01:15:11,470
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't just bring a teacher who teaches Spanish over to teach French because there is different licensure.

887
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:17,635
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have one middle school teacher who would be able to teach French, but it certainly wouldn't be enough to address the needs of both schools.

888
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:22,982
[SPEAKER_05]: So the estimated cost would be a salary level plus materials, an estimate of $75,000.

889
01:15:23,623 --> 01:15:35,708
[SPEAKER_05]: A second idea that we have that would be wonderful, which is much less of a cost, about $6,000, but it would be difficult to find a location.

890
01:15:35,888 --> 01:15:45,893
[SPEAKER_05]: We would be looking for a world language lab so that students would be able to practice their communication in an environment that was set up and conducive to doing so.

891
01:15:46,779 --> 01:15:53,462
[SPEAKER_05]: It is possible for us to go to a computer lab, but it's not set up with the dividers.

892
01:15:53,742 --> 01:16:00,204
[SPEAKER_05]: To do it right, you need it set up in a location, and then teachers within the department would be able to rotate in.

893
01:16:01,464 --> 01:16:07,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So the initial thought is to start one on the high school level, and then eventually bring it down to the middle school level.

894
01:16:09,007 --> 01:16:15,390
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the third idea for a wish list would be, and this really is more long range, we're thinking,

895
01:16:17,705 --> 01:16:19,946
[SPEAKER_05]: The possibility of introducing new languages.

896
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:27,609
[SPEAKER_05]: A survey was done a couple of years ago and in that survey there appeared to be some support for Portuguese and for Arabic.

897
01:16:28,909 --> 01:16:38,152
[SPEAKER_05]: So we certainly do want to investigate that but that would not be for next year but that would be something that we would begin investigating or doing additional surveys on next year.

898
01:16:38,893 --> 01:16:41,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think at this point that's an overview.

899
01:16:41,234 --> 01:16:45,035
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we would be happy to take any questions that you have.

900
01:16:46,453 --> 01:16:47,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

901
01:16:47,694 --> 01:16:51,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Doesn't seem to be any questions, but because you did such a good detailed report for us.

902
01:16:52,156 --> 01:16:52,436
[SPEAKER_16]: You do?

903
01:16:52,576 --> 01:16:52,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

904
01:16:53,057 --> 01:16:53,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Change your mind.

905
01:16:54,057 --> 01:16:54,457
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

906
01:16:54,557 --> 01:16:55,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Member van der Kloot.

907
01:16:55,638 --> 01:17:14,508
[SPEAKER_19]: So with the change in the Italian consulate covering the money for the paraprofessionals, I think that we need to have a discussion about how we will use that time, whether we'll continue

908
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:19,423
[SPEAKER_19]: as we are or whether there's something else that's needed in the curriculum.

909
01:17:22,525 --> 01:17:30,489
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how much time people have yet from the administrative have been able to consider the options and what might be needed.

910
01:17:31,329 --> 01:17:39,553
[SPEAKER_19]: I would make a motion to send this topic to the curriculum subcommittee meeting once people are ready to address it.

911
01:17:43,373 --> 01:17:46,496
[SPEAKER_16]: For approval by a member of Vindiclude, seconded by a member of Rousseau.

912
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:47,777
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

913
01:17:47,797 --> 01:17:48,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

914
01:17:48,478 --> 01:17:49,239
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

915
01:17:49,879 --> 01:17:50,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

916
01:17:53,423 --> 01:17:53,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

917
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:54,984
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

918
01:17:58,628 --> 01:17:59,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep, member Graham.

919
01:18:01,429 --> 01:18:03,069
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

920
01:18:03,749 --> 01:18:14,332
[SPEAKER_22]: At the middle school level, do you have any data that tells us what demand would look like if there was another language offering?

921
01:18:14,432 --> 01:18:20,674
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't know how the selection process happens today.

922
01:18:21,814 --> 01:18:28,056
[SPEAKER_22]: If one language is more popular than the other, if you introduce French, how would that change the dynamics of

923
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:30,576
[SPEAKER_22]: students and sort of what their preferences are.

924
01:18:30,656 --> 01:18:36,957
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know if you have that information or there's a way you can sort of start to collect it to understand demand.

925
01:18:37,698 --> 01:18:47,320
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we, so right now we have one, we have one staff member that, that one staff member could possibly travel over to the other middle school.

926
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:52,262
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and if we did that, we would have to restrict, restrict it to grade six.

927
01:18:53,702 --> 01:18:53,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

928
01:18:54,811 --> 01:18:56,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's how we would have to start.

929
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:09,895
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of demand, what we do, and this is going to happen very soon in early March, is we send a form out to grade five students and their parents, and we tell them what the options are.

930
01:19:10,055 --> 01:19:19,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now the two options are your Spanish and your Italian, and then they respond, and then we put them in those classes.

931
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:22,858
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know.

932
01:19:22,878 --> 01:19:24,118
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have to do,

933
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:28,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd have to get that information to figure out how many sections.

934
01:19:28,357 --> 01:19:29,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a demand?

935
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:37,418
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at the feedback that some of the high school teachers have given us that they wish that they had had an opportunity to start French earlier.

936
01:19:37,659 --> 01:19:40,319
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kind of worked backwards with that.

937
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:47,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also seeing the French program, it is not as strong as the Spanish and the Italian programs.

938
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:54,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are kind of deducing that it is because of the fact that it's not offered in middle school.

939
01:19:55,482 --> 01:20:07,473
[SPEAKER_22]: »» So is there an opportunity to do some data collection since this form is going to go out and families are going to be responding in real time to understand, would there be a preference there?

940
01:20:08,992 --> 01:20:09,753
[SPEAKER_22]: if it was offered.

941
01:20:09,793 --> 01:20:15,856
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, obviously we'd have to say it's not offered currently, but we're trying to understand what the demand would be if there was three choices.

942
01:20:15,876 --> 01:20:21,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so on the form that goes out, we usually, where there were two choices, we ask them to rate one and two.

943
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,680
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no guarantee.

944
01:20:23,201 --> 01:20:27,043
[SPEAKER_05]: We really have tried and the principals have tried to honor what the request is.

945
01:20:28,728 --> 01:20:33,250
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's always that caveat that if we can't, we'll put you in the other language.

946
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:35,071
[SPEAKER_05]: So certainly we could put something out.

947
01:20:35,551 --> 01:20:40,534
[SPEAKER_05]: If French was an option, what's your first choice, what's your second choice, what's your third choice?

948
01:20:41,054 --> 01:20:44,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the demand wasn't there, then we would just go to the second choice.

949
01:20:45,636 --> 01:20:46,297
[SPEAKER_05]: We could do that.

950
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:55,921
[SPEAKER_22]: And I guess the other question that I would have is, do you have data that you could share with us about historical demand?

951
01:20:55,981 --> 01:20:56,922
[SPEAKER_22]: So how often?

952
01:20:57,992 --> 01:20:59,213
[SPEAKER_22]: does somebody get their first choice?

953
01:20:59,253 --> 01:21:03,377
[SPEAKER_22]: How often does somebody not get their first choice and gets placed?

954
01:21:03,417 --> 01:21:11,423
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I feel like once you start on a trajectory with language, you're in a shoot and you're continuing down that path.

955
01:21:11,503 --> 01:21:12,944
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a little bit harder to change course.

956
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:19,510
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm just curious if we have the right number of the right things based on what we see the demand is.

957
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:30,212
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're saying last year, so based on last year's requests, how many of those students, I can get that because we have the request, it would just be matching it up with where the kids are.

958
01:21:30,832 --> 01:21:41,296
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a number of students that based on their MCAS scores, based on other assessments that were targeted for intervention that Nicole Chiesa talked about.

959
01:21:42,657 --> 01:21:46,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So for additional remediation in English.

960
01:21:46,517 --> 01:21:52,485
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the exception of those students, I would say those who requested a language, almost all of them did get what they wanted.

961
01:21:52,505 --> 01:21:53,807
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good.

962
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:55,429
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can confirm that.

963
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:56,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that would be great.

964
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:56,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

965
01:21:58,193 --> 01:21:58,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

966
01:22:00,748 --> 01:22:10,392
[SPEAKER_07]: The sudden loss of funding from Casset, do we get an annual check or are we like literally like suddenly we have a hole?

967
01:22:10,712 --> 01:22:16,414
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe, and perhaps Christine could confirm this because the money doesn't come to me, I believe it's in two installments of $25,000.

968
01:22:16,454 --> 01:22:17,154
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we received the $25,000.

969
01:22:17,335 --> 01:22:17,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we?

970
01:22:23,369 --> 01:22:33,636
[SPEAKER_14]: It was previously one installment at the end of a fiscal year, but we had received $25,000 of it this year, so that will no longer be coming.

971
01:22:33,676 --> 01:22:40,841
[SPEAKER_14]: It is identified as a revenue source to supplement, so that will not be on our revenue options for the upcoming year.

972
01:22:42,122 --> 01:22:42,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

973
01:22:42,722 --> 01:22:43,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

974
01:22:43,422 --> 01:22:47,105
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, and we'll discuss more in the curriculum subcommittee.

975
01:22:48,711 --> 01:22:50,652
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure where we want to go next.

976
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:57,133
[SPEAKER_16]: We have some parents, we have some administrators here, city hall employees.

977
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:13,918
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll just go and order a recommendation to approve donation for three speech and language pathologists to attend the National Speech Association Conference.

978
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:14,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

979
01:23:14,478 --> 01:23:15,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Joan Bowen.

980
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:15,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi.

981
01:23:15,919 --> 01:23:16,379
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

982
01:23:17,383 --> 01:23:17,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

983
01:23:17,623 --> 01:23:29,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Elizabeth Gomez would like to donate funds to support the registration costs for up to three of Medford's speech and language therapists to attend a one-day National Stuttering Association event.

984
01:23:30,498 --> 01:23:33,061
[SPEAKER_11]: This event will take place on March 7, 2020 at a cost of $59 per person.

985
01:23:36,708 --> 01:23:39,251
[SPEAKER_11]: resulting in a potential donation of $177.

986
01:23:39,971 --> 01:23:41,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

987
01:23:41,893 --> 01:23:49,341
[SPEAKER_11]: Gomez is the parent of a child who stutters and is the co-leader of the National Stuttering Association's Boston Family Chapter.

988
01:23:49,821 --> 01:23:52,364
[SPEAKER_11]: She is also a Medford High School Spanish teacher.

989
01:23:53,448 --> 01:24:09,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Attendance at the National Stuttering Association event will provide participating speech and language therapists with an interactive presentation about therapy for school-age children who stutter, including treatment of the motor, social, cognitive, and emotional aspects of the disorder.

990
01:24:10,557 --> 01:24:21,122
[SPEAKER_11]: This generous donation is truly appreciated, and we know that educator participation and professional development can result in an increase in the collective knowledge of the entire team

991
01:24:21,741 --> 01:24:24,223
[SPEAKER_11]: which results in better outcomes for our students.

992
01:24:24,723 --> 01:24:28,605
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm here tonight to request that Medford Public Schools accepts this donation.

993
01:24:29,486 --> 01:24:29,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

994
01:24:29,966 --> 01:24:31,967
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

995
01:24:31,987 --> 01:24:33,668
[SPEAKER_15]: I make a motion to accept the donation.

996
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:36,270
[SPEAKER_15]: But first, I also want to thank Ms.

997
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:44,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Gomez for the very generous thought and offer, both as a parent and as a teacher in our district, that she's doing this.

998
01:24:44,995 --> 01:24:46,476
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really remarkable.

999
01:24:46,496 --> 01:24:46,676
[SPEAKER_15]: It is.

1000
01:24:46,836 --> 01:24:47,957
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's great news.

1001
01:24:49,938 --> 01:24:51,159
[SPEAKER_15]: So how many teachers are going?

1002
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:55,322
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's three speech therapists that will be attending, yes.

1003
01:24:55,482 --> 01:24:57,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, and so are they already identified?

1004
01:24:57,363 --> 01:24:57,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Did they self-identify?

1005
01:24:58,024 --> 01:24:58,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, they have.

1006
01:24:58,324 --> 01:24:58,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

1007
01:24:58,724 --> 01:24:58,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Great.

1008
01:24:59,064 --> 01:24:59,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1009
01:24:59,425 --> 01:25:00,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations, that's great.

1010
01:25:00,465 --> 01:25:00,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1011
01:25:00,665 --> 01:25:01,486
[SPEAKER_15]: So I make a motion to approve.

1012
01:25:01,786 --> 01:25:02,627
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion to approve.

1013
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:03,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Van der Kloot.

1014
01:25:03,868 --> 01:25:05,729
[SPEAKER_19]: I second the motion and thank Ms.

1015
01:25:05,769 --> 01:25:06,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Gozmez as well.

1016
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:10,692
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not the first year she's done it and we appreciate her generosity and support.

1017
01:25:11,033 --> 01:25:11,493
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1018
01:25:11,513 --> 01:25:11,613
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1019
01:25:11,933 --> 01:25:15,156

[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

1024
01:25:18,118 --> 01:25:18,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1025
01:25:19,963 --> 01:25:22,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Recommendation to approve middle school field trips to New York.

1026
01:25:25,707 --> 01:25:26,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, we should.

1027
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:28,569
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, we should.

1028
01:25:28,609 --> 01:25:29,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:30,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Roll call vote.

[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1033
01:25:33,912 --> 01:25:34,413
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Kreatz.

1034
01:25:34,433 --> 01:25:34,493
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1035
01:25:35,233 --> 01:25:36,074
[SPEAKER_19]: Member McLaughlin.

1036
01:25:36,975 --> 01:25:37,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1037
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:38,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Mustone is absent.

1038

01:25:39,056 --> 01:25:39,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1040
01:25:39,656 --> 01:25:40,517
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Van der Kloot.

1041
01:25:41,097 --> 01:25:41,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1042
01:25:41,558 --> 01:25:42,518
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:44,600

[SPEAKER_16]: Six in favor, one absent.

1046
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:49,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1047
01:25:50,051 --> 01:25:55,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Recommendation to approve middle school field trips to New York, Principal Nick Tucci and Principal Michael Downs.

1048
01:25:58,758 --> 01:25:59,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening once again.

1049
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:06,044
[SPEAKER_02]: On behalf of the McGlynn Middle School, I'd like to present our proposal and answer any questions you may have to take the 8th grade students of the McGlynn Middle School

1050
01:26:07,109 --> 01:26:08,169
[SPEAKER_02]: to a trip to New York City.

1051
01:26:08,509 --> 01:26:11,670
[SPEAKER_02]: The eighth grade trip to New York City has been an annual tradition since our school opened in 2001.

1052
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:18,872
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews and McGlynn Middle School held a parent meeting in the fall where the New York City trip was introduced and questions were answered.

1053
01:26:19,652 --> 01:26:23,113
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, 56 students have signed up for the trip for the McGlynn Middle School.

1054
01:26:23,713 --> 01:26:29,434
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost of the trip is $650 per student with scholarships offered for financially challenged families.

1055
01:26:30,234 --> 01:26:32,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Property damage insurance is provided by the company.

1056
01:26:33,315 --> 01:26:36,256
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a school nurse traveling with the group on this trip.

1057
01:26:37,256 --> 01:26:44,299
[SPEAKER_02]: The trip is scheduled for the weekend of June 5th through the 7th with buses departing Friday, June 5th at 6 a.m.

1058
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:56,483
[SPEAKER_02]: The itinerary for the trip includes a visit to the Intrepid Sea and Airspace Museum, Times Square, Top of the Rock, the Museum of Natural History, the 9-11 Memorial, a production of Stomp,

1059
01:26:57,023 --> 01:27:00,026
[SPEAKER_02]: and a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

1060
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:09,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Students remaining in school that Friday and not participating in the New York City Field Trip will participate in enrichment activities that support curriculum and social developments.

1061
01:27:09,817 --> 01:27:18,246
[SPEAKER_02]: We will also be looking to offer another trip, like we did last year, for 8th graders who stay back to attend a field trip to Medford High School to swim in the pool.

1062
01:27:19,147 --> 01:27:28,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to acknowledge the work of the McGlynn Middle School teacher and New York City Trip Advisor, Sabrina Yeager, who was unable to make it for tonight for her hard work and attention to detail on this field trip.

1063
01:27:29,055 --> 01:27:38,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Her tireless work ethic this year will pay off in dividends to offer a lifetime experience for our students who enjoy this trip to the Big Apple with their teachers and their peers.

1064
01:27:39,303 --> 01:27:44,907
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, I'll turn it over to Andrews Middle School Principal, Michael Downs, who will speak further on the trip on behalf of the Andrews Middle School.

1065
01:27:45,168 --> 01:27:45,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1066
01:27:46,215 --> 01:27:46,696
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Nick.

1067
01:27:46,976 --> 01:27:47,717
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello once again.

1068
01:27:48,619 --> 01:27:52,444
[SPEAKER_28]: So this year, the Andrews has 120 students going.

1069
01:27:52,705 --> 01:28:00,476
[SPEAKER_28]: And before I get into more specifics about the trip, I want to give a very public and big thank you to our PTO.

1070
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:17,009
[SPEAKER_28]: and some anonymous families who have worked tirelessly, the PTO in particular, to provide scholarships for some of our students in need and to those families out there that did donate without anybody wanting to know who they were, who are also helping out some of our students in need.

1071
01:28:17,429 --> 01:28:20,131
[SPEAKER_28]: And without them, there are some students that wouldn't be able to go.

1072
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:27,517
[SPEAKER_28]: So for that, I'm very grateful and I'm very humbled by the support that not only the PTO gives us, but some of the families in the community.

1073
01:28:27,897 --> 01:28:29,679
[SPEAKER_28]: to the students of the Andrews Middle School.

1074
01:28:30,419 --> 01:28:37,245
[SPEAKER_28]: Similar to the McGlynn Middle School, this has been a huge part of being an eighth grader since 2001.

1075
01:28:37,385 --> 01:28:38,586
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a very exciting time.

1076
01:28:38,927 --> 01:28:40,128
[SPEAKER_28]: Our students look forward to it.

1077
01:28:40,208 --> 01:28:41,489
[SPEAKER_28]: Our teachers look forward to it.

1078
01:28:42,369 --> 01:28:45,152
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to give another big thank you out to Miss Wendy Fuller.

1079
01:28:45,552 --> 01:28:50,496
[SPEAKER_28]: She is my New York City Trip Advisor this year, and she has worked very hard so far already.

1080
01:28:50,977 --> 01:28:55,320
[SPEAKER_28]: I also have to thank publicly Miss Kathy Johnson, who has helped out a lot as well.

1081
01:28:56,181 --> 01:29:00,443
[SPEAKER_28]: Our trip is very similar with our itinerary, but this year there's a couple changes.

1082
01:29:00,543 --> 01:29:06,046
[SPEAKER_28]: We are going to go to the Top of the Rock Observatory this year, which is new for our trip.

1083
01:29:06,506 --> 01:29:13,950
[SPEAKER_28]: We are also going to the Intrepid Air and Space Museum, the 9-11 Memorial, and of course we are also going to see STOMP.

1084
01:29:14,030 --> 01:29:21,414
[SPEAKER_28]: So the two schools, although we are both going to New York City, we will see each other here and there, but we also have our own itinerary

1085
01:29:21,794 --> 01:29:25,098
[SPEAKER_28]: But both the experiences are great for all the students involved.

1086
01:29:25,979 --> 01:29:28,381
[SPEAKER_28]: If you have any questions, please let me know.

1087
01:29:28,481 --> 01:29:29,202
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you so much.

1088
01:29:29,943 --> 01:29:30,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1089
01:29:30,564 --> 01:29:31,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

1090
01:29:32,546 --> 01:29:33,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1091
01:29:33,727 --> 01:29:39,053
[SPEAKER_15]: This is always a fun trip, I know, for the students having had two 8th graders who have gone on the trip.

1092
01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:41,555
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a couple of questions.

1093
01:29:43,249 --> 01:29:44,030
[SPEAKER_15]: if you can help me with.

1094
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:48,712
[SPEAKER_15]: So I also want to thank the teachers and you guys for going on the trip.

1095
01:29:48,752 --> 01:29:50,733
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the coordination that's involved with this.

1096
01:29:50,813 --> 01:30:01,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And I actually went on the trip myself a few years ago and trying to wrangle all those students and keep track of everybody and make sure everyone's fed and you get some sleep and all that stuff.

1097
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:02,840
[SPEAKER_15]: We know how hard it is.

1098
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:04,401
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for doing this.

1099
01:30:06,482 --> 01:30:09,984
[SPEAKER_15]: So it looks like for the Andrews, there's 120 students that are going.

1100
01:30:10,124 --> 01:30:11,004
[SPEAKER_15]: And for the McGlynn, there are 56.

1101
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:16,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Of how many in your 8th grade class?

1102
01:30:16,308 --> 01:30:21,432
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe Mr. Downs, if you want to answer first, how many in the... As of right now, we have 162 8th grade.

1103
01:30:21,452 --> 01:30:21,432
162?

1104
01:30:21,472 --> 01:30:21,773
[SPEAKER_28]: 8th graders, yes.

1105
01:30:21,793 --> 01:30:21,933
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

1106
01:30:21,973 --> 01:30:22,833
[SPEAKER_28]: So of 162, 120 are going?

1107
01:30:22,853 --> 01:30:23,674
[SPEAKER_28]: That's correct.

1108
01:30:23,694 --> 01:30:23,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1109
01:30:23,874 --> 01:30:24,915
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, how about you, Mr. Tucci?

1110
01:30:24,935 --> 01:30:26,256
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's our smallest class.

1111
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:26,797
[SPEAKER_15]: We have about 140.

1112
01:30:26,837 --> 01:30:26,797
140?

1113
01:30:26,857 --> 01:30:28,138
[SPEAKER_15]: So out of 140, 56 students are attending.

1114
01:30:38,282 --> 01:30:40,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so that's a big percentage difference.

1115
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:45,549
[SPEAKER_15]: It obviously is very generous of the PTO to be able to supplement with scholarships.

1116
01:30:45,629 --> 01:30:49,833
[SPEAKER_15]: How many scholarships did you guys give out?

1117
01:30:49,893 --> 01:30:53,017
[SPEAKER_15]: So can I ask you, Mr. Downs first?

1118
01:30:54,668 --> 01:31:00,091
[SPEAKER_28]: So the PTO, we are lucky enough that they give us two full scholarships and two partial scholarships.

1119
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:05,294
[SPEAKER_28]: I've also received a few full scholarships from some members of the community.

1120
01:31:06,555 --> 01:31:18,261
[SPEAKER_28]: And also, one family in particular is also gonna help out with some of the expenses for our students who are going so that they can have some money to buy things as they get down there so that they can have a few souvenirs.

1121
01:31:18,641 --> 01:31:19,822
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really generous, that's great.

1122
01:31:21,815 --> 01:31:31,641
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're very happy to announce the McGlynn Middle School, we've raised over $3,500 towards our scholarship fund this year to help offset the cost for a lot of students.

1123
01:31:32,182 --> 01:31:42,188
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, we had a scholarship application process where the students at McGlynn that were interested in applying for a scholarship, they could go ahead and write an essay to a certain prompt.

1124
01:31:42,608 --> 01:31:45,110
[SPEAKER_02]: The essay went into teachers and myself, we reviewed them,

1125
01:31:45,864 --> 01:31:50,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And scholarships went out, and we were able to help supplement the cost for a number of different students.

1126
01:31:50,187 --> 01:31:55,150
[SPEAKER_02]: You can imagine how much of an impact that over $3,500 went to help out families in need.

1127
01:31:55,731 --> 01:31:59,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So certainly, we were very pleased and happy with that effort this year.

1128
01:31:59,974 --> 01:32:05,598
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a dance, and we raised over $1,000 at just one dance in order to help to fund that trip, too.

1129
01:32:06,018 --> 01:32:07,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had about 150 students attend.

1130
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,742
[SPEAKER_15]: So how many full or partial scholarships do you now?

1131
01:32:13,287 --> 01:32:21,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I don't have that offhand, but I believe I had to guess about a dozen, you know, partial or even more than partial scholarships were, you know, handed up.

1132
01:32:21,809 --> 01:32:22,349
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

1133
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:24,410
[SPEAKER_15]: Were there students that you're aware of?

1134
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:29,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there students that you're aware of that wanted to go on the trip that have not been able to go?

1135
01:32:29,551 --> 01:32:36,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single student that has wanted to attend, and we have some really good relationships with our students where they've been able to make that known to us.

1136
01:32:36,482 --> 01:32:39,764
[SPEAKER_02]: we've been able to help them out in any type of way that we were able to.

1137
01:32:39,784 --> 01:32:40,284
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

1138
01:32:40,384 --> 01:32:40,985
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1139
01:32:41,005 --> 01:32:44,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes that came in the form of a $250 scholarship, other times more.

1140
01:32:45,067 --> 01:32:45,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1141
01:32:45,287 --> 01:32:50,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really happy to say that we were able to make sure that this was a trip of reality for the students that wanted to attend.

1142
01:32:50,850 --> 01:32:51,411
[SPEAKER_28]: That's great.

1143
01:32:52,111 --> 01:32:52,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, sorry.

1144
01:32:53,272 --> 01:32:58,295
[SPEAKER_28]: All of our students that needed money to go on a trip were given money for ours as well.

1145
01:32:58,555 --> 01:32:59,055
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

1146
01:32:59,095 --> 01:32:59,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1147
01:32:59,496 --> 01:32:59,916
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1148
01:33:00,616 --> 01:33:02,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Very generous of the community and of you all.

1149
01:33:06,496 --> 01:33:15,862
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, so the literature that was handed out as well that talks about the conditions of being able to attend the trip, which are both academic and behavior.

1150
01:33:17,043 --> 01:33:22,007
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a behavior contract that you talked about with info and registration packet.

1151
01:33:22,447 --> 01:33:24,969
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have a copy of that contract.

1152
01:33:25,009 --> 01:33:31,154
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just curious about that, if you could send that to us so that we can, would you mind sending it so that we can see and just,

1153
01:33:33,743 --> 01:33:37,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And what if there's behavior that's a manifestation of disability?

1154
01:33:38,393 --> 01:33:41,135
[SPEAKER_15]: for a student that, you know, wants to go on the trip to New York City.

1155
01:33:41,175 --> 01:33:44,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there supports through the Special Education Department?

1156
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,357
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the Director of Pupil Services is here.

1157
01:33:46,978 --> 01:33:55,082
[SPEAKER_15]: But also for families that are listening, if there are supports that are needed to be able to attend field trips for students with disabilities and the manifestation of their disability.

1158
01:33:55,322 --> 01:33:55,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

1159
01:33:55,863 --> 01:33:58,384
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure this trip is a very inclusive type of trip.

1160
01:33:58,524 --> 01:33:58,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1161
01:33:58,844 --> 01:34:00,705
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be inclusive for all of our students.

1162
01:34:00,745 --> 01:34:01,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1163
01:34:01,105 --> 01:34:07,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would work very closely with the student, their families, the Special Education Departments in order to make sure that we're as inclusive as we can.

1164
01:34:08,189 --> 01:34:08,990
[SPEAKER_02]: with all of our students.

1165
01:34:09,390 --> 01:34:13,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I see that you have a nurse going, which is really good to hear on that trip for the students that need it.

1166
01:34:13,854 --> 01:34:14,295
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's great.

1167
01:34:14,635 --> 01:34:29,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anything on the registration form or on the behavior contract that makes any note of if you have a disability or need accommodations, a process or procedure for letting folks know?

1168
01:34:31,792 --> 01:34:33,373
[SPEAKER_15]: And if not, maybe I need to make it.

1169
01:34:33,413 --> 01:34:36,253
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, we could perhaps take a look at adding some language towards that.

1170
01:34:37,074 --> 01:34:38,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know off the top of my hands.

1171
01:34:38,294 --> 01:34:41,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather not speak to that without having it right in front of me.

1172
01:34:41,315 --> 01:34:50,278
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same point in time, we certainly do want to make sure that we are reaching out to families to make it really be very accommodating and very inclusive to all those types of students.

1173
01:34:50,318 --> 01:34:50,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1174
01:34:50,698 --> 01:34:54,919
[SPEAKER_15]: And making sure that the families know, obviously, so that they can be able to prepare in advance.

1175
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:00,822
[SPEAKER_15]: For some parents, it's hard to be able to let your child go on these trips.

1176
01:35:00,842 --> 01:35:03,883
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you feel like there's support there, then it makes all the difference.

1177
01:35:04,683 --> 01:35:13,807
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to make a motion then that the field trip materials have a line item for individuals with disabilities letting folks know.

1178
01:35:14,627 --> 01:35:20,311
[SPEAKER_15]: that if they need accommodations that they, you know, that there's an avenue to pursue to let folks know what those accommodations are.

1179
01:35:20,391 --> 01:35:35,020
[SPEAKER_15]: So I make a motion to include materials on the field trip, any, you know, this particular field trip, but obviously, you know, we'll move forward in future field trips, that if families need accommodations for students with disabilities that they just need let us know.

1180
01:35:35,501 --> 01:35:35,721
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly.

1181
01:35:35,741 --> 01:35:38,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1182
01:35:38,663 --> 01:35:39,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

1183
01:35:40,164 --> 01:35:40,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

1184
01:35:40,964 --> 01:35:42,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for the reports.

1185
01:35:42,845 --> 01:35:47,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to say, I did notice that you're going to the Intrepid Sea, Air, Space Museum.

1186
01:35:47,671 --> 01:35:50,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I googled it and it looks really exciting.

1187
01:35:50,854 --> 01:35:54,238
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so much for the students, so much information to be gained.

1188
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:55,799
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like a great stop.

1189
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:59,820
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a really high rating, and it looks really fun.

1190
01:36:00,561 --> 01:36:07,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to know if there was any difference between where we did have the middle school lottery.

1191
01:36:08,003 --> 01:36:12,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there a difference in the numbers from last year to this year with the McGlynn and the Andrews?

1192
01:36:12,424 --> 01:36:15,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Or did the numbers kind of stay the same with the number of students going?

1193
01:36:16,179 --> 01:36:17,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there any noticeable difference?

1194
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,921
[SPEAKER_02]: We took, I believe, about 60 students last year at the McGlynn.

1195
01:36:21,381 --> 01:36:22,942
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have about 56 this year.

1196
01:36:23,042 --> 01:36:24,742
[SPEAKER_02]: So a slight, you know, dip.

1197
01:36:25,022 --> 01:36:27,763
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also had less students this year in our eighth grade class.

1198
01:36:28,223 --> 01:36:31,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the percentage was right around the same as last year at the McGlynn.

1199
01:36:32,305 --> 01:36:34,286
[SPEAKER_28]: Last year we had 135 students go.

1200
01:36:34,306 --> 01:36:38,267
[SPEAKER_28]: And this may be a shocker to you, but that is my favorite part of the trip, by the way.

1201
01:36:40,478 --> 01:36:46,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And let's see, I just want to see if we have one more.

1202
01:36:46,744 --> 01:36:59,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I just, I also wanted to know, is there any communication, like I know that the students, they, you know, they're not allowed to make phone calls home or like, or tweet or anything like that, or is there a way where parents can follow

1203
01:37:00,443 --> 01:37:02,405
[SPEAKER_09]: or pictures are seen like on Twitter.

1204
01:37:02,885 --> 01:37:08,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Does any of that happen while they're on the trip, whether teachers might post it or the field trip advisor?

1205
01:37:08,612 --> 01:37:12,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Both schools are going to be using the Remind app in order to communicate information back home to families.

1206
01:37:13,297 --> 01:37:15,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition, we'll be using the McGlynn Middle School Twitter account.

1207
01:37:16,561 --> 01:37:24,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Blackboard mobile application app will be up and running too as well for our families to be able to communicate out information to them too.

1208
01:37:24,167 --> 01:37:30,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be a great opportunity to show them great pictures and all the sites and all the fun that we're going to be having on the trip.

1209
01:37:30,914 --> 01:37:31,114
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

1210
01:37:31,134 --> 01:37:31,414
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1211
01:37:31,754 --> 01:37:32,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you enjoy.

1212
01:37:33,416 --> 01:37:33,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1213
01:37:33,956 --> 01:37:34,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Member van de Kloot.

1214
01:37:34,697 --> 01:37:40,182
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, my questions are concerning the students left behind.

1215
01:37:41,605 --> 01:37:46,369
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Tucci, you noted that the kids, you were thinking of a trip to the Medford High School swimming pool.

1216
01:37:48,310 --> 01:37:53,213
[SPEAKER_19]: And is that the same thought for the Andrews students?

1217
01:37:54,174 --> 01:37:59,698
[SPEAKER_28]: So our eighth grade teachers make a point to make the day as enjoyable as possible for our students.

1218
01:37:59,978 --> 01:38:08,825
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm not 100% sure what they're going to do yet this year, but each year they do activities and make it as fun of a day as possible for those students who are not going on that trip.

1219
01:38:09,125 --> 01:38:16,210
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I understand that for many students, maybe going to the high school pool is great, but not all students know how to swim.

1220
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:22,293
[SPEAKER_19]: And part of me says going to New York City for the weekend versus going to the pool.

1221
01:38:23,354 --> 01:38:29,778
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that students used to go into Boston or have something outside of Medford.

1222
01:38:30,519 --> 01:38:32,380
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm just sort of curious about that choice.

1223
01:38:33,807 --> 01:38:38,168
[SPEAKER_02]: We could certainly explore different opportunities in order to try to engage the students that aren't attending.

1224
01:38:38,448 --> 01:38:40,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be open to, you know, different ideas.

1225
01:38:40,449 --> 01:38:44,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year I worked with Rachel Perry and they were able to give a really cool opportunity.

1226
01:38:44,590 --> 01:38:45,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the kids like it?

1227
01:38:45,530 --> 01:38:45,950
[SPEAKER_02]: They loved it.

1228
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:49,751
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a chance to eat in the high school cafeteria in Cafeteria 1.

1229
01:38:50,431 --> 01:38:53,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Mrs. Treanor, the assistant principal for grade 9, came and spoke to the students briefly.

1230
01:38:53,992 --> 01:38:55,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Mr. DeLaver did too as well.

1231
01:38:55,712 --> 01:39:02,003
[SPEAKER_02]: to the students that were able to attend and welcomed them into the high school and it was almost like a little extra transition opportunity they had.

1232
01:39:02,123 --> 01:39:07,312
[SPEAKER_19]: For kids who either didn't know how to swim or was there a swimming assessment?

1233
01:39:07,372 --> 01:39:08,735
[SPEAKER_19]: How did how did we handle that?

1234
01:39:09,943 --> 01:39:25,468
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was on the New York City trip at the time, but I believe what the case was is that they assessed the students at the very beginning, and then they kind of differentiating the swimming opportunities for students based upon their swimming capabilities.

1235
01:39:25,828 --> 01:39:39,012
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I absolutely can understand that it would be great, and if it is great, I wouldn't want to change it, but I certainly feel like I need to ask about it, because it is, you know, it's just not as great as going to New York City.

1236
01:39:39,578 --> 01:39:41,038
[SPEAKER_19]: no matter how much we might love the pool.

1237
01:39:41,718 --> 01:39:43,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, thank you.

1238
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:54,701
[SPEAKER_16]: A motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Van der Kloot, that the field trip form be updated to have language about disability accommodations that people may need.

1239
01:39:55,501 --> 01:39:56,081
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1240
01:39:56,101 --> 01:39:57,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call, please.

1241
01:39:57,822 --> 01:39:59,222
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call has been requested.

1242
01:40:01,383 --> 01:40:02,943
[SPEAKER_19]: So on that motion, Member Graham.

1243
01:40:04,236 --> 01:40:04,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Kreatz?

1244
01:40:04,776 --> 01:40:04,856
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1245
01:40:05,617 --> 01:40:06,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Member McLaughlin?

1246
01:40:06,417 --> 01:40:06,477
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1247
01:40:07,457 --> 01:40:09,158
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Mustone is absent.

1248
01:40:09,578 --> 01:40:10,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Ruseau?

1249
01:40:10,258 --> 01:40:13,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I abstain.

1250
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:15,340
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Vanderkloot, yes.

1251
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,281
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1252
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:18,161
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1253
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:22,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Five in the affirmative, one absent, one abstaining.

1254
01:40:23,123 --> 01:40:23,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper passes.

1255
01:40:24,183 --> 01:40:24,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, gentlemen.

1256
01:40:25,043 --> 01:40:25,364
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1257
01:40:25,544 --> 01:40:25,864
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1258
01:40:25,884 --> 01:40:26,644
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good evening, everyone.

1259
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:30,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Tucci, if you could stay.

1260
01:40:31,171 --> 01:40:35,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Recommendation to approve environmental camp field trip by Principal Nick Tucci.

1261
01:40:35,873 --> 01:40:45,538
[SPEAKER_02]: On behalf of the McGlynn Middle School, I'd like to present our proposal and answer any questions you may have to take our seventh grade students at the McGlynn Middle School on a trip to the Alton Jones Environmental Overnight Field Trip.

1262
01:40:45,618 --> 01:40:55,043
[SPEAKER_02]: With 2,300 acres of lakes, forests, and farmland, the W. Alton Jones campus offers an immense outdoor classroom that's perfect for learning, exploration, adventure, and fun.

1263
01:40:55,883 --> 01:41:03,518
[SPEAKER_02]: At W. Alton Jones, students gain an understanding and appreciation of the natural world while learning about themselves and working collaboratively with others.

1264
01:41:04,019 --> 01:41:07,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Their fun-filled activities-based programs are designed with the students in mind.

1265
01:41:08,726 --> 01:41:14,489
[SPEAKER_02]: This trip will get students excited about learning while enriching their classroom work with hands-on, first-person experiences.

1266
01:41:15,369 --> 01:41:18,791
[SPEAKER_02]: The seventh grade trip to this environmental camp has been an annual tradition for many years.

1267
01:41:19,412 --> 01:41:25,475
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, we anticipate, based upon surveying teachers and previous years' data, that approximately 80 students will attend the trip.

1268
01:41:26,235 --> 01:41:32,038
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost of the trip will be $220 per student, with scholarships offered for financially challenged families.

1269
01:41:32,638 --> 01:41:35,320
[SPEAKER_02]: The nurse will also be attending the trip from the Medford Public Schools.

1270
01:41:36,445 --> 01:41:39,366
[SPEAKER_02]: The trip is scheduled for Monday, May 4th to Tuesday, May 5th.

1271
01:41:39,966 --> 01:41:48,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to acknowledge the work of McGlynn Middle School teachers and environmental trip organizers, Patty Haas and Angela Bellini, for their hard work and attention to detail for the field trip.

1272
01:41:48,869 --> 01:41:51,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have.

1273
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:52,410
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

1274
01:41:53,551 --> 01:41:54,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Looks like another great trip.

1275
01:41:56,512 --> 01:42:06,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Same point, just if you could include on the forms that if there's any requirements for any accommodations for students with disabilities

1276
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:07,691
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be appreciated.

1277
01:42:07,831 --> 01:42:10,312
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, the same with the behavior.

1278
01:42:10,332 --> 01:42:16,316
[SPEAKER_15]: It's unclear to me, and maybe it's a longer conversation with superintendent.

1279
01:42:17,016 --> 01:42:18,957
[SPEAKER_15]: The behavior agreement is included on this one.

1280
01:42:19,337 --> 01:42:20,358
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for that.

1281
01:42:22,459 --> 01:42:26,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so maybe it's a longer conversation with superintendent Edouard-Vincent about how

1282
01:42:27,532 --> 01:42:31,675
[SPEAKER_15]: It's addressed if there's behavior that are manifestations of a student's disability.

1283
01:42:32,656 --> 01:42:39,161
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe we can talk more about that, but have some language that would be helpful for people that need accommodations.

1284
01:42:39,562 --> 01:42:40,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

1285
01:42:40,422 --> 01:42:40,742
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

1286
01:42:40,823 --> 01:42:41,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Enjoy.

1287
01:42:42,564 --> 01:42:43,304
[SPEAKER_19]: Member van de Kloot.

1288
01:42:43,705 --> 01:42:50,290
[SPEAKER_19]: If the trip needs to be canceled at the last minute for any reason, what is the policy regarding a refund?

1289
01:42:53,672 --> 01:42:57,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in the past we've worked with this through the University of Rhode Island.

1290
01:43:00,853 --> 01:43:02,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice in working with us, accommodating with us.

1291
01:43:02,814 --> 01:43:11,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a great relationship, and I can confirm with them what their policy is, but we don't pay until the very last moments on this trip.

1292
01:43:12,781 --> 01:43:20,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a situation where, because it is paid, I believe, just about a week or so before, that we certainly can recoup the money.

1293
01:43:21,207 --> 01:43:27,271
[SPEAKER_19]: And while I'm at it, for the New York trip, if there was a cancellation, is there insurance to cover that?

1294
01:43:28,052 --> 01:43:28,552
[SPEAKER_02]: There is not.

1295
01:43:33,116 --> 01:43:35,719
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought we required that there would be.

1296
01:43:35,739 --> 01:43:47,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there is a situation where it's a substantial amount more for the trips that causes the trip to go up in a significant type of fashion if we were to add travel insurance along those lines.

1297
01:43:48,178 --> 01:43:57,340
[SPEAKER_19]: You are talking to the person whose child was in the grade when the trip was canceled and they stayed at the Medford Hotel rather than being able to go to New York City.

1298
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:59,981
[SPEAKER_19]: So a little concerned about that.

1299
01:44:02,321 --> 01:44:06,062
[SPEAKER_19]: Could you just check into it and maybe we'll talk, clarify?

1300
01:44:06,222 --> 01:44:06,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly can.

1301
01:44:07,242 --> 01:44:07,522
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

1302
01:44:07,842 --> 01:44:08,183
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1303
01:44:09,423 --> 01:44:09,883
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham.

1304
01:44:11,158 --> 01:44:15,540
[SPEAKER_22]: Does the Andrew 7th grade class go on this same field trip or is it just a McGlynn trip?

1305
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,281
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a McGlynn trip for many years.

1306
01:44:19,361 --> 01:44:29,125
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be happy to potentially allow them the opportunity to look into this possibility in the future and we'd be very happy to collaborate with them in the future on a trip along these lines.

1307
01:44:30,045 --> 01:44:37,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a wonderful tradition at the McGlynn Middle School for many years and our students come back really enthused and have the opportunity to go experience

1308
01:44:38,949 --> 01:44:42,452
[SPEAKER_02]: an opportunity to learn a lot about science and the natural environment.

1309
01:44:42,472 --> 01:44:47,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So they come back enthused and ready to learn for the next few months of the school year, especially in their science classes.

1310
01:44:48,556 --> 01:44:59,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I am a huge advocate of field trips and the experiences that they afford our students, some of whom may not have similar experiences.

1311
01:45:01,032 --> 01:45:09,994
[SPEAKER_22]: just sort of in their general path as they kind of travel through seventh grade as an individual or eighth grade or any other grade for that matter.

1312
01:45:10,094 --> 01:45:20,175
[SPEAKER_22]: So definitely exploring particularly now that we've moved to a full lottery and we're embracing that model where we're saying our middle school experiences are really the same.

1313
01:45:20,195 --> 01:45:30,017
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it would be really great for us to think about these kinds of experiences as places where we want to be able to offer similar experiences between the two schools.

1314
01:45:31,233 --> 01:45:40,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be happy to work with Mr. Downs and the Andrews Middle School in order to show them the different connections we have to bring this type of learning environment to the Andrews Middle School students as well.

1315
01:45:40,359 --> 01:45:40,979
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's exciting.

1316
01:45:41,280 --> 01:45:41,640
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1317
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:43,021
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1318
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:43,721
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Ruseau.

1319
01:45:46,323 --> 01:45:47,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the report.

1320
01:45:49,025 --> 01:45:53,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just noticing now that both of these field trips are not using our field trip form.

1321
01:45:53,407 --> 01:45:54,028
[SPEAKER_07]: We worked very

1322
01:45:55,311 --> 01:45:58,612
[SPEAKER_07]: we worked a lot on, and in fact were used last year for this field trip.

1323
01:45:59,912 --> 01:46:08,173
[SPEAKER_07]: We have an approved format with a set of questions that must be answered for us to approve these.

1324
01:46:09,534 --> 01:46:15,935
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know whether or not all the questions are answered, but I know for a fact that you guys actually used those forms last year.

1325
01:46:17,495 --> 01:46:22,496
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's only been less than a year, so we should dust off those forms and use those

1326
01:46:23,465 --> 01:46:29,011
[SPEAKER_07]: because they had a very specific set of questions with the signatures and when they had to happen by nursing, et cetera.

1327
01:46:30,672 --> 01:46:42,024
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, I'm certainly fine with approving this with the caveat that if all the questions that were on that form are not answered, then the approval doesn't seem valid.

1328
01:46:43,505 --> 01:46:44,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know where the form is.

1329
01:46:44,927 --> 01:46:46,128
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it's in the Google Drive.

1330
01:46:47,152 --> 01:46:49,734
[SPEAKER_07]: L, that is Google.

1331
01:46:50,274 --> 01:46:55,097
[SPEAKER_07]: But those should be completed, I think, and sent to us, even just as informational.

1332
01:46:55,817 --> 01:47:01,941
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's a form that's missing, I'll be happy to send it your way and make sure that that gets to your information, to your attention.

1333
01:47:03,101 --> 01:47:03,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1334
01:47:03,601 --> 01:47:03,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1335
01:47:04,102 --> 01:47:04,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1336
01:47:04,762 --> 01:47:05,162
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

1337
01:47:07,184 --> 01:47:07,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a motion?

1338
01:47:10,005 --> 01:47:10,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion for approval.

1339
01:47:11,426 --> 01:47:12,146
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1340
01:47:12,867 --> 01:47:13,127
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call.

1341
01:47:18,298 --> 01:47:20,659
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin, roll call.

1342
01:47:31,662 --> 01:47:31,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1343
01:47:34,063 --> 01:47:36,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Six in the affirmative, one absent, paper passes.

1344
01:47:37,084 --> 01:47:38,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you everybody for your patience.

1345
01:47:38,585 --> 01:47:43,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Number seven, report on middle school participation in greater Boston league sports.

1346
01:47:43,947 --> 01:47:45,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Robert Maloney.

1347
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:53,877
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

1348
01:47:54,818 --> 01:47:58,519
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the first year of the Greater Boston League's middle school sports program.

1349
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:00,540
[SPEAKER_25]: It's been incredible.

1350
01:48:01,221 --> 01:48:05,643
[SPEAKER_25]: We started off an exciting fall with baseball, softball, and cross country.

1351
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:10,185
[SPEAKER_25]: The winter season just concluded with girls and boys basketball.

1352
01:48:11,585 --> 01:48:15,007
[SPEAKER_25]: Our boys basketball program won the league.

1353
01:48:15,507 --> 01:48:16,888
[SPEAKER_25]: The girls lost in the finals.

1354
01:48:17,982 --> 01:48:24,764
[SPEAKER_25]: And in the next couple of weeks, we're going to start registration for the spring outdoor track, which will take place at Hormel Stadium.

1355
01:48:26,064 --> 01:48:28,425
[SPEAKER_25]: The principals have been fantastic at the middle schools.

1356
01:48:29,546 --> 01:48:34,127
[SPEAKER_25]: We've been fortunate to hire some teachers at the middle school complex, which has helped out immensely.

1357
01:48:34,847 --> 01:48:39,128
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're looking to hire another, somebody from the complex to do outdoor track.

1358
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:43,730
[SPEAKER_25]: Rachel Perry and myself will be down in the middle schools next week.

1359
01:48:45,114 --> 01:48:49,036
[SPEAKER_25]: We have some holes in the schedule at the pool in the spring.

1360
01:48:49,816 --> 01:48:58,741
[SPEAKER_25]: So with summer coming and water safety, we're gonna see if we can get any interest of getting some 7th and 8th graders up to do some water safety at the pool.

1361
01:48:59,821 --> 01:49:01,362
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd be happy to take any questions.

1362
01:49:01,402 --> 01:49:03,603
[SPEAKER_25]: We're on budget, so Christine will be happy.

1363
01:49:04,804 --> 01:49:08,486
[SPEAKER_25]: Just a money lady.

1364
01:49:10,227 --> 01:49:11,687
[SPEAKER_25]: But I'll be happy to take any questions.

1365
01:49:12,207 --> 01:49:12,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

1366
01:49:13,879 --> 01:49:15,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for the report, Mr. Lowy.

1367
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:18,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a question on the bus transportation.

1368
01:49:19,802 --> 01:49:23,904
[SPEAKER_09]: The fees were pretty consistent for the different sports.

1369
01:49:23,984 --> 01:49:29,086
[SPEAKER_09]: For the cross-country middle school, the bus transportation was a little bit more.

1370
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:29,946
[SPEAKER_09]: It was $2,640.

1371
01:49:30,187 --> 01:49:37,130
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wasn't sure why that was, or is that the combined number for both schools?

1372
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:39,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't sure whether it was different.

1373
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:46,223
[SPEAKER_25]: Like 53 cross country kids.

1374
01:49:46,583 --> 01:49:48,923
[SPEAKER_25]: So they only had one home meet.

1375
01:49:49,563 --> 01:49:51,064
[SPEAKER_25]: This year they went away four times.

1376
01:49:51,084 --> 01:49:52,704
[SPEAKER_25]: Next year they'll be home four times.

1377
01:49:54,144 --> 01:50:00,826
[SPEAKER_25]: The baseball and softball, they travel together, so we just split the transportation bill in half.

1378
01:50:01,486 --> 01:50:05,207
[SPEAKER_25]: And basketball in the winter, they travel together, so it keeps the transportation costs down.

1379
01:50:06,347 --> 01:50:07,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Great, thank you.

1380
01:50:11,311 --> 01:50:15,214
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may, from the chair, for the spring, is it just track?

1381
01:50:15,274 --> 01:50:16,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there any other sport?

1382
01:50:16,315 --> 01:50:17,335
[SPEAKER_25]: Just outdoor track.

1383
01:50:17,456 --> 01:50:18,636
[SPEAKER_25]: For boys and girls to combine.

1384
01:50:18,676 --> 01:50:18,837
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.

1385
01:50:19,097 --> 01:50:20,558
[SPEAKER_25]: And hopefully we can build on it.

1386
01:50:20,658 --> 01:50:23,540
[SPEAKER_25]: And we've already got requests for girls volleyball and swimming.

1387
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:25,662
[SPEAKER_25]: So we'll keep you guys updated.

1388
01:50:29,104 --> 01:50:29,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1389
01:50:29,865 --> 01:50:30,145
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1390
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:33,647
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1391
01:50:33,667 --> 01:50:37,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Report on literacy screenings, intervention update.

1392
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:37,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1393
01:50:37,610 --> 01:50:39,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Diane Caldwell, Dr. Nicole Chiesa,

1394
01:50:40,549 --> 01:50:40,689
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

1395
01:50:40,709 --> 01:50:42,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Kathleen Champoli and Ms.

1396
01:50:42,330 --> 01:50:43,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Suzanne Campbell.

1397
01:50:44,230 --> 01:50:47,451
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know we have some parents who have waited patiently.

1398
01:50:47,511 --> 01:50:47,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1399
01:50:53,373 --> 01:50:54,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So good evening.

1400
01:50:55,313 --> 01:51:05,316
[SPEAKER_03]: At Mayor Blanco-Kern's request, this report provides an update on developments in MedFed's early literacy screening intervention procedures since last June.

1401
01:51:06,137 --> 01:51:10,278
[SPEAKER_03]: As indicated below in your report, the district has made numerous improvements

1402
01:51:10,863 --> 01:51:22,626
[SPEAKER_03]: in our screen to interview procedures, including the increased use of early literacy screeners, data analysis, targeted intervention, and professional development.

1403
01:51:23,486 --> 01:51:39,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Prior to and throughout the school year, 2019-20, myself, Supervisor of Speech, Language, and Hearing Services, Susanna Campbell, Director of Humanities, Nicole Chiesa, and Coordinator of Special Education, Katie Champoli,

1404
01:51:40,236 --> 01:51:44,219
[SPEAKER_03]: have met at least twice a month to plan and lead this process.

1405
01:51:44,979 --> 01:51:59,309
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, elementary school principals, classroom teachers, Title I educators, English language learner teachers, and special educators have worked with our K-2 teachers and students to make these changes possible.

1406
01:52:00,170 --> 01:52:06,034
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like to acknowledge and thank the educators who have piloted our screening intervention tools this year.

1407
01:52:06,951 --> 01:52:16,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Ongoing feedback is essential in reflecting upon the success of these tools as we make decisions and await DESI's dyslexia screening guidelines.

1408
01:52:16,733 --> 01:52:24,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Please note that the DESI pilots are currently underway and may or may not meet DESI's upcoming guidelines.

1409
01:52:25,435 --> 01:52:27,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So we may have to wait longer than we thought.

1410
01:52:28,716 --> 01:52:35,938
[SPEAKER_03]: So with me this evening is what I refer to as my dream team up here who meet twice a week in my office

1411
01:52:36,416 --> 01:52:41,058
[SPEAKER_03]: to discuss protocols and professional development and where we're going next.

1412
01:52:42,238 --> 01:52:49,680
[SPEAKER_03]: As they'll fill you in as we go along, we are currently on our second screening and we have one more week to go.

1413
01:52:49,721 --> 01:52:55,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're in our final week for the screening for both Lexia Rappert and MAPS growth.

1414
01:52:55,803 --> 01:53:02,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So at this time I'd like to ask Nicole Chiesa if she would talk a little bit about the Dyslexia Historical Background.

1415
01:53:02,565 --> 01:53:02,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicole?

1416
01:53:06,568 --> 01:53:07,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Good evening.

1417
01:53:07,989 --> 01:53:19,315
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to provide a little background on the law and the work that we have done, as well as the directives from the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

1418
01:53:19,895 --> 01:53:24,797
[SPEAKER_24]: So just as a reminder, on October 19, 2018, Chapter 272 of the Acts of 2018 was approved by Massachusetts legislation.

1419
01:53:24,857 --> 01:53:26,518
[SPEAKER_24]: This law requires that the Department of Education

1420
01:53:34,817 --> 01:53:51,331
[SPEAKER_24]: in consultation with EEC, issue guidelines to assist districts in developing screening procedures or protocols that demonstrate one or more potential indicators of a neurological learning disability, including but not limited to dyslexia.

1421
01:53:52,332 --> 01:53:59,098
[SPEAKER_24]: School districts continue to await DESE's provision of specific guidelines for the screeners and protocols.

1422
01:53:59,738 --> 01:54:01,660
[SPEAKER_24]: DESE has recently engaged

1423
01:54:02,104 --> 01:54:15,768
[SPEAKER_24]: Pivot Learning to help develop and finalize the guidelines for school districts and early education providers on dyslexia and other learning disabilities, including recommendations for screening and intervention.

1424
01:54:16,409 --> 01:54:24,611
[SPEAKER_24]: It is expected that Pivot's guidelines will be presented to DESE in fall 2020 for DESE's further review.

1425
01:54:26,692 --> 01:54:29,553
[SPEAKER_24]: In anticipation of these specific guidelines from DESE,

1426
01:54:30,187 --> 01:54:35,388
[SPEAKER_24]: Medford Public Schools has taken numerous proactive steps since the bill's inception.

1427
01:54:36,488 --> 01:54:57,972
[SPEAKER_24]: As noted above, this report will focus on the work conducted since June 2019, including piloting two early literacy screeners, namely Lexia Rapid and NWEA Map, as well as some additional interventions and very much comprehensive professional development that we have been engaged in.

1428
01:55:01,386 --> 01:55:05,968
[SPEAKER_24]: The next portion of this report will talk about professional development related to early literacy.

1429
01:55:06,849 --> 01:55:13,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Throughout this school year, we have spent a significant amount of resources and time devoted to early literacy professional development.

1430
01:55:14,513 --> 01:55:23,698
[SPEAKER_24]: The professional development has occurred through newly formed partnerships with Hill for Literacy, which is a literary organization focused on the science of reading.

1431
01:55:24,858 --> 01:55:27,640
[SPEAKER_24]: Professional development has also centered on outside conferences,

1432
01:55:28,294 --> 01:55:39,381
[SPEAKER_24]: as well as graduate courses sponsored by the Department of Secondary and, excuse me, the Department of Secondary and Elementary Education, specific to identifying and supporting early literacy deficits.

1433
01:55:40,242 --> 01:55:58,033
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition to this, we are also piloting screeners, and with the screeners come multiple professional development opportunities, including not just overviews of the screeners and how to administer, but also significant professional development, how to analyze the data,

1434
01:55:58,548 --> 01:56:02,250
[SPEAKER_24]: and what steps to take next once the data has been analyzed.

1435
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:12,015
[SPEAKER_24]: This has been provided to our kindergarten, first, and second grade general education teachers, as well as specialists and our building and district administrators.

1436
01:56:14,016 --> 01:56:18,798
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a list in your report that outlines the different professional development opportunities.

1437
01:56:19,099 --> 01:56:22,340
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just going to very quickly provide an outline.

1438
01:56:22,460 --> 01:56:24,001
[SPEAKER_24]: In fall winter 2019 and winter 2020, spring 2020,

1439
01:56:27,975 --> 01:56:31,917
[SPEAKER_24]: we have what is called a reading intervention workshop series.

1440
01:56:32,458 --> 01:56:36,880
[SPEAKER_24]: This is provided by Hill for Literacy as well as internal reading specialists.

1441
01:56:37,361 --> 01:56:40,522
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a three-part series that's offered twice throughout the school year.

1442
01:56:40,983 --> 01:56:45,425
[SPEAKER_24]: It is an optional professional development opportunity for our elementary teachers.

1443
01:56:46,766 --> 01:56:56,492
[SPEAKER_24]: Specific workshops include implementing phonemic awareness strategies in the classroom, implementing phonics and fluency strategies in the classroom,

1444
01:56:56,955 --> 01:57:00,257
[SPEAKER_24]: and implementing vocabulary and comprehension strategies in the classroom.

1445
01:57:00,617 --> 01:57:02,759
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's going on throughout this school year.

1446
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:23,773
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition to that, we have professional development related to our WIN, What I Need, curriculum committee, which came together again, reconvened, to look at PD opportunities from the previous school year and to reevaluate the assessments, review the data, and explore interventions and communications with staff.

1447
01:57:25,862 --> 01:57:34,988
[SPEAKER_24]: In October, we had our NWEA MAP growth training, and we had our Lexia Rapid implementation rollout at the schools.

1448
01:57:35,549 --> 01:57:48,798
[SPEAKER_24]: The Columbus is piloting NWEA MAP, and Lexia Rapid is being piloted at the McGlynn through the grant through DESE, and then as a separate pilot, not through DESE, at the Roberts and the Columbus.

1449
01:57:49,859 --> 01:57:55,463
[SPEAKER_24]: There was a Department of Elementary and Secondary Education sponsored graduate credit course

1450
01:57:56,062 --> 01:58:03,224
[SPEAKER_24]: called Dyslexia, Dysgraphia, and Dyscalculia, and that was attended by various staff members within Medford Public Schools.

1451
01:58:04,844 --> 01:58:12,747
[SPEAKER_24]: That same month, we had members of our staff and our administration attend the Dyslexia Foundation Conference, which was held at Harvard University.

1452
01:58:14,647 --> 01:58:20,269
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition to that, in November of 2019, we introduced what's called Lexia Core 5.

1453
01:58:21,169 --> 01:58:24,450
[SPEAKER_24]: You've heard about that a few times during some of the pre-budget,

1454
01:58:25,239 --> 01:58:26,360
[SPEAKER_24]: presentations as well.

1455
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:36,004
[SPEAKER_24]: This is a web-based literacy intervention enrichment tool that was introduced to our K-3 staff as well as our specialists within the elementary schools.

1456
01:58:36,324 --> 01:58:42,007
[SPEAKER_24]: This is optional for the teachers to attend in person, and there was also an online optional training.

1457
01:58:43,128 --> 01:58:46,849
[SPEAKER_24]: Teachers are really enjoying this program, the ones that are participating.

1458
01:58:48,030 --> 01:58:51,972
[SPEAKER_24]: In March, we are going to devote half of our Professional Development Day

1459
01:58:52,529 --> 01:58:58,452
[SPEAKER_24]: to our enhanced core reading instruction, which will be led by Hill for Literacy.

1460
01:58:59,272 --> 01:59:07,757
[SPEAKER_24]: And throughout the school year, we will continue with additional trainings devoted to our enhanced core reading instruction for full implementation of next school year.

1461
01:59:09,197 --> 01:59:18,262
[SPEAKER_24]: And then in March, we also will have additional training on data analysis, taking the second round of testing for Alexia Rapid and NWEA-MAP.

1462
01:59:18,747 --> 01:59:24,793
[SPEAKER_24]: looking at growth, looking at literacy deficits, looking at literacy strengths for our students.

1463
01:59:24,894 --> 01:59:29,599
[SPEAKER_24]: And this training is provided by Alexia Learning as well as NWEA.

1464
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:34,244
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm now going to move this on to Ms.

1465
01:59:34,264 --> 01:59:36,746
[SPEAKER_24]: Champoli, who will talk about the screenings.

1466
01:59:36,987 --> 01:59:37,307
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1467
01:59:40,313 --> 01:59:40,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everyone.

1468
01:59:41,554 --> 01:59:45,877
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to give you a little timeline of the implementation of the screenings that we've done.

1469
01:59:45,978 --> 01:59:54,925
[SPEAKER_04]: So throughout this school year in 1920, a variety of early literacy screeners were utilized in an effort to best support our students in identifying specific literacy needs.

1470
01:59:55,705 --> 02:00:07,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Two new screening tools were piloted through DESE's Early Literacy Screening Grant in anticipation of the dyslexia screening guidelines that DESE is tasked with creating, and as part of Medford's dedication to MTSSE.

1471
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:11,800
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the timeline of events associated with implementation.

1472
02:00:12,421 --> 02:00:16,041
[SPEAKER_04]: In June 2019, Medford applied for the Early Literacy Screening Grant.

1473
02:00:16,561 --> 02:00:24,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And in August, DESE awards Medford with the Early Literacy Screening Grant for the NWEA math growth for use at the Columbus Elementary School.

1474
02:00:25,983 --> 02:00:32,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Shortly thereafter, we found out that there were other opportunities available through the same grant and applied again.

1475
02:00:32,184 --> 02:00:38,385
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were awarded the grant for Alexia Rapid for use at McGlynn Elementary School.

1476
02:00:40,733 --> 02:00:46,294
[SPEAKER_04]: In speaking with representatives for Alexia, Ms.

1477
02:00:46,314 --> 02:00:51,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Campbell worked her magic and was able to get Alexia used for our other schools as well.

1478
02:00:52,597 --> 02:00:56,398
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alexia Rapid was also used at the Roberts and the Brooks.

1479
02:00:57,258 --> 02:00:58,819
[SPEAKER_04]: So that happened in September of 2019.

1480
02:00:58,859 --> 02:00:59,519
[SPEAKER_04]: In October of 2019,

1481
02:01:03,678 --> 02:01:07,079
[SPEAKER_04]: The rapid automatic naming screener was finalized.

1482
02:01:07,119 --> 02:01:13,540
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a supplement to these other pilots because these pilots did not include an assessment of rapid automatic naming.

1483
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:23,082
[SPEAKER_04]: In September through November of 2019, there was baseline screening for our K-2 students using our pilot tools.

1484
02:01:24,182 --> 02:01:29,843
[SPEAKER_04]: In October of 2019, when assessments, which were already in place before our pilots,

1485
02:01:30,597 --> 02:01:37,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Win assessments, including the baseline and progress monitoring, were administered throughout the school year, beginning in October of 2019.

1486
02:01:37,362 --> 02:01:47,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Upcoming for the remainder of this year, we'll be doing our second and third rounds of screening, which is to be complete by the end of this month.

1487
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:49,911
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's for all of our K-2 students.

1488
02:01:49,931 --> 02:01:51,212
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do a third round in May.

1489
02:01:51,232 --> 02:01:56,976
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll also be continuing with win assessments for progress monitoring in February, April, and May of 2020.

1490
02:01:59,737 --> 02:02:03,439
[SPEAKER_04]: The next portion talks about the training for data analysis.

1491
02:02:04,860 --> 02:02:18,187
[SPEAKER_04]: So as has been previously mentioned in this report, administrators and educators have received specific training related to analysis of the data that we've gathered from MAP and from Lexia Rapid.

1492
02:02:20,577 --> 02:02:28,982
[SPEAKER_04]: After the screenings, the district began analyzing this initial data through multiple lenses, looking at individual data, class data, and district-wide performance.

1493
02:02:30,003 --> 02:02:33,865
[SPEAKER_04]: The timeline below explains a little bit about what we've done so far.

1494
02:02:34,505 --> 02:02:39,088
[SPEAKER_04]: The first two bullets actually say November of 2019, but that training happened in October.

1495
02:02:39,869 --> 02:02:41,810
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about, we came before.

1496
02:02:42,350 --> 02:02:46,653
[SPEAKER_04]: the school committee earlier this school year and talked a little bit about this.

1497
02:02:46,853 --> 02:03:03,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in October of 2019, a representative from NWEA came out to the Columbus and spoke with administrators and with educators about looking at the data, making meaning of the data, and talking about how they can begin to use that data to guide their instruction.

1498
02:03:05,317 --> 02:03:11,800
[SPEAKER_04]: That also took place through Lexia at the McGlynn, Brooks, and Roberts in November of 2019.

1499
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:28,249
[SPEAKER_04]: In January of 2020, the results of the rapid automatic naming screeners were analyzed by district administrators to determine which students demonstrated scores below their peer group district-wide.

1500
02:03:29,369 --> 02:03:34,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Students who showed weaknesses in this area are at risk for difficulty with reading fluency and automaticity.

1501
02:03:35,314 --> 02:03:39,576
[SPEAKER_04]: which is why we wanted to supplement those pilots that didn't include that particular area.

1502
02:03:41,357 --> 02:04:04,751
[SPEAKER_04]: In January of 2020, we also had Lexia Core 5 data coaching seminar that actually started, that was the optional PD, and that started, I believe it was in November, and so we've met a couple times since then with teachers who have wanted this optional PD to learn more about Lexia Core 5, but its use is not limited to those who wanted to participate in the optional PD.

1503
02:04:05,983 --> 02:04:12,370
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available to K-2 teachers and I think even some grade 3 teachers because I know I have a third grader who's using it.

1504
02:04:16,714 --> 02:04:28,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Throughout the fall and the winter of 2019, data analysis for K-3 students using LexiaCore 5, which is the web-based literacy intervention and enrichment tool that Ms.

1505
02:04:28,426 --> 02:04:29,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Campbell was also able to

1506
02:04:30,750 --> 02:04:36,334
[SPEAKER_04]: to secure from Lexi and they were very generous in giving us licenses for this school year.

1507
02:04:37,475 --> 02:04:43,439
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Dr. Chiesa has noted, has been a big hit with the teachers who have put it to use.

1508
02:04:44,080 --> 02:04:48,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have kids of my own who are using it and enjoy using it at home independently.

1509
02:04:50,164 --> 02:04:50,644
[SPEAKER_04]: In March 2020,

1510
02:04:53,281 --> 02:04:58,004
[SPEAKER_04]: The NWEA map data analysis based on the February screening will take place.

1511
02:04:58,685 --> 02:05:07,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So next week, I believe it is, they're coming to the Columbus to talk to administrators and teachers, again, about the data analysis from that second screening.

1512
02:05:08,592 --> 02:05:15,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Also in March of 2020, Lexia will come out and do similar data analysis with the schools participating in RAPIDS.

1513
02:05:17,945 --> 02:05:28,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Then just this bottom bullet here is just reminding that we have been doing the data analysis of WINS since the beginning of the school year as well with gen ed teachers, specialists, and administrators.

1514
02:05:29,332 --> 02:05:35,976
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I will turn it over to Susanna for a summary of the intervention.

1515
02:05:38,417 --> 02:05:39,338
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, everybody.

1516
02:05:41,042 --> 02:05:43,184
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will talk a little bit about the intervention.

1517
02:05:43,324 --> 02:05:48,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Once we had the data, we needed to know what do we do now with this information that we have gathered.

1518
02:05:48,850 --> 02:05:57,839
[SPEAKER_13]: So throughout school year 2019-2020, educators have been provided with numerous resources to use when addressing students' early literacy needs.

1519
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:00,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Equipped with sound professional development,

1520
02:06:01,697 --> 02:06:11,123
[SPEAKER_13]: and additional, I'm sorry, initial early literacy screening results and additional intervention resources, the following was embedded within student classroom instruction.

1521
02:06:12,364 --> 02:06:25,393
[SPEAKER_13]: In November 2019, educators were instructed on how to use the tools that were embedded in the NWEA MAP growth screening measure to determine what interventions are needed for their particular students.

1522
02:06:26,551 --> 02:06:32,955
[SPEAKER_13]: In November 2019, educators were also instructed on how to use the tools embedded in Lexia Rapid to develop intervention.

1523
02:06:33,675 --> 02:06:40,759
[SPEAKER_13]: So those teachers at the Columbus who were using NWEA MAP were taught how do we access the tools that we need.

1524
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:49,525
[SPEAKER_13]: And the students, the teachers who were working with students at the other three schools were given instruction on how to use the Lexia Rapid tools.

1525
02:06:50,463 --> 02:06:57,929
[SPEAKER_13]: In November 19, Lexia Core 5, the web-based literacy intervention enrichment tool that we've discussed, was introduced to K-3 staff.

1526
02:06:58,730 --> 02:07:01,552
[SPEAKER_13]: And this was done through an in-person optional training.

1527
02:07:02,273 --> 02:07:05,916
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also made it available as an online optional training.

1528
02:07:06,036 --> 02:07:12,882
[SPEAKER_13]: So for teachers who were not able to come after school hours, they could also take this training at home or during their prep periods.

1529
02:07:14,237 --> 02:07:23,780
[SPEAKER_13]: In February of 2020, teachers were provided with materials and intervention strategies to use with students who demonstrated a need for additional practice in automaticity and fluency.

1530
02:07:24,620 --> 02:07:33,123
[SPEAKER_13]: So these were for the students who we determined were at risk for difficulty with these skills because of their scores on the RAND measure, the rapid automatic naming.

1531
02:07:33,883 --> 02:07:41,005
[SPEAKER_13]: The materials that were provided to teachers, and these included specific classroom ideas, so things they could do with their entire class,

1532
02:07:41,708 --> 02:07:52,415
[SPEAKER_13]: scripted lessons they could use one-on-one or in small groups, carryover, coloring, and writing activities that they could use after students had demonstrated some success, and flashcards.

1533
02:07:53,096 --> 02:07:56,879
[SPEAKER_13]: The provided materials targeted key skills and developmental order.

1534
02:07:57,319 --> 02:08:05,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So starting with automaticity for letter names, letter sound correspondence, sight words, regular words, and passage fluency.

1535
02:08:07,086 --> 02:08:10,668
[SPEAKER_13]: In February 2020, ECRI was endorsed by our curriculum subcommittee.

1536
02:08:11,302 --> 02:08:11,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

1537
02:08:11,722 --> 02:08:12,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot.

1538
02:08:13,123 --> 02:08:17,726
[SPEAKER_13]: And upcoming in March 2020, ECRI professional development will begin for K-2 teachers.

1539
02:08:18,907 --> 02:08:23,910
[SPEAKER_13]: Upcoming in school year 2021, ECRI implementation and coaching will be taking place.

1540
02:08:24,670 --> 02:08:27,432
[SPEAKER_13]: We've also been working to communicate with stakeholders.

1541
02:08:29,053 --> 02:08:35,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Throughout this school year, we have worked with multiple levels of communication with various stakeholders related to early literacy.

1542
02:08:35,958 --> 02:08:39,660
[SPEAKER_13]: And as our work continues, we want to continue to expand this communication.

1543
02:08:40,383 --> 02:08:43,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Current communications include, but are not limited to, the following.

1544
02:08:44,464 --> 02:08:49,365
[SPEAKER_13]: In September and October, reports were made to the school committee by this group.

1545
02:08:50,345 --> 02:08:55,186
[SPEAKER_13]: In fall of 2019, we attended the SIL Literacy Conference.

1546
02:08:55,386 --> 02:08:59,607
[SPEAKER_13]: SIL is a piece of Hill, Hill for Literacy, that we've discussed.

1547
02:09:00,027 --> 02:09:07,969
[SPEAKER_13]: They did a project in Somerville, and some of the Medford teachers participated in that, so we went to go listen and see what they had accomplished there in Somerville.

1548
02:09:09,428 --> 02:09:17,133
[SPEAKER_13]: In fall 2019, Nicole was able to establish a working relationship with Hill for Literacy and Crafting Minds.

1549
02:09:18,194 --> 02:09:21,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Conversations and work with both groups continue throughout the school year.

1550
02:09:22,657 --> 02:09:30,342
[SPEAKER_13]: In fall 2019 to spring 2020, multiple communications with teachers and administrators have been taking place regarding both screening pilots.

1551
02:09:32,457 --> 02:09:40,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently, we have multiple communications going on with teachers on the WIN assessment, and this is being analyzed by our Director of Humanities, Nicole Chiesa.

1552
02:09:41,804 --> 02:09:53,112
[SPEAKER_13]: In November 2019, during report card conferences, grade one and two teachers reported students' results on the NWEA map growth and Lexi Rapid, depending on the assessment that was given to the students.

1553
02:09:54,215 --> 02:10:02,863
[SPEAKER_13]: In January 2020, Kristen Howell, she's a Title I teacher at the Columbus Elementary School, and I were selected to be part of the Literacy Champions Committee.

1554
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:08,168
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I may, just give a little shout out to somebody who's here that's running that group for us.

1555
02:10:09,009 --> 02:10:13,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Catherine Tarka is here, she's the Director of Literacy for DESE, and she is running that group.

1556
02:10:14,174 --> 02:10:18,798
[SPEAKER_13]: This committee will advise DESE on a statewide early literacy initiative that kicks off in 2020.

1557
02:10:20,705 --> 02:10:27,329
[SPEAKER_13]: In January 2020, I was selected to be a contributor to the development of the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines.

1558
02:10:27,449 --> 02:10:36,895
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is something that's being conducted with Pivot Learning, and they collected names of people who might be stakeholders and reached out and asked for stakeholders to participate.

1559
02:10:36,935 --> 02:10:38,456
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've done one meeting so far.

1560
02:10:38,496 --> 02:10:39,657
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be another one in March.

1561
02:10:40,637 --> 02:10:48,202
[SPEAKER_13]: In February 2020, during report card conferences, kindergarten teachers reported students' results on NWEA MAP Growth and Lexia Rapid.

1562
02:10:49,786 --> 02:10:54,308
[SPEAKER_13]: And in February 2020, this whole group met with ECRI.

1563
02:10:55,409 --> 02:11:06,754
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, Nicole and Diane met and discussed the ECRI literacy curriculum with the subcommittee and it was accepted and endorsed.

1564
02:11:07,534 --> 02:11:12,117
[SPEAKER_13]: And in March 2020, we have an upcoming meeting with the Hill for Literacy and Crafting Minds.

1565
02:11:12,757 --> 02:11:15,218
[SPEAKER_13]: So now I will turn it over to Ms.

1566
02:11:15,258 --> 02:11:17,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Caldwell, who will talk about our next steps.

1567
02:11:18,735 --> 02:11:23,836
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you can see we've been incredibly busy this year and the year is not over yet.

1568
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:26,997
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only halfway through and maybe a little more than halfway through.

1569
02:11:27,937 --> 02:11:33,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So to try to pull it all together at present we're piloting two early literacy screening tools.

1570
02:11:34,258 --> 02:11:39,400
[SPEAKER_03]: We're using a variety of intervention materials tools strategies and we're gathering our data.

1571
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:41,060
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very clear.

1572
02:11:41,967 --> 02:11:44,488
[SPEAKER_03]: very early in this process to draw conclusions.

1573
02:11:45,108 --> 02:12:07,117
[SPEAKER_03]: There still are numerous steps to be completed throughout the remainder of the school year, including finishing our second screening, which is at the end of this week, and our third screening using the piloted screeners, sustained progress monitoring, continued intervention based on student need, and additional data analysis training, as well as professional development.

1574
02:12:08,192 --> 02:12:13,534
[SPEAKER_03]: As we continue this, we will have more of a complete picture of where we're going.

1575
02:12:14,015 --> 02:12:16,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be looking at the following.

1576
02:12:16,556 --> 02:12:20,257
[SPEAKER_03]: We will review our data from assessments conducted in February and May.

1577
02:12:20,938 --> 02:12:24,179
[SPEAKER_03]: We will elicit and review feedback from teachers and principals.

1578
02:12:24,719 --> 02:12:27,020
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already started to receive some of that feedback.

1579
02:12:27,060 --> 02:12:32,543
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a survey monkey out to our teachers and what we're finding out is that

1580
02:12:33,667 --> 02:12:37,570
[SPEAKER_03]: The teachers who are using Lexia really love Lexia a lot.

1581
02:12:38,711 --> 02:12:41,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Maps, not so much, at least that's what I'm hearing thus far.

1582
02:12:42,954 --> 02:12:52,242
[SPEAKER_03]: We did ask our teachers about what is it in our journeys program that they feel is lacking, missing, and most of the responses have been phonics.

1583
02:12:52,873 --> 02:12:57,434
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're very happy that we now have ECRI that will fulfill that piece of it.

1584
02:12:58,234 --> 02:13:01,735
[SPEAKER_03]: And another one of the questions was about Core 5.

1585
02:13:02,775 --> 02:13:06,176
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about an intervention tool as Core 5?

1586
02:13:06,916 --> 02:13:11,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of the teachers who are using Core 5 can't say enough wonderful things about it.

1587
02:13:12,477 --> 02:13:18,659
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will talk about this because it's in our budget and it's something that we would like for our teachers for next year.

1588
02:13:21,271 --> 02:13:34,634
[SPEAKER_03]: We will need to eventually select a districtwide universal literacy tool, screening tool, select a progress monitoring tool, propose to you a final cost for districtwide universal screening and progress monitoring tools.

1589
02:13:35,065 --> 02:13:37,046
[SPEAKER_03]: for the 2021 school year.

1590
02:13:37,986 --> 02:13:47,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Oversee the implementation of ECRI, which the ladies have informed we're going to start our process on March 3rd, which is our next professional development day.

1591
02:13:48,551 --> 02:13:55,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're hoping to complete a full day by using a series of Wednesdays, perhaps from April and May.

1592
02:13:57,315 --> 02:14:00,196
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll finalize additional interventions for the 2021 school year.

1593
02:14:02,088 --> 02:14:10,916
[SPEAKER_03]: propose your final cost, and then increase outreach for parent communication, collaboration regarding screening, and progress monitoring.

1594
02:14:11,897 --> 02:14:14,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know this has been a lot to digest tonight.

1595
02:14:14,479 --> 02:14:19,284
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pretty comprehensive report because we've been pretty busy over the past year.

1596
02:14:20,024 --> 02:14:22,246
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're happy to answer any questions.

1597
02:14:23,287 --> 02:14:23,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

1598
02:14:25,801 --> 02:14:30,204
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for this thorough report.

1599
02:14:32,405 --> 02:14:46,615
[SPEAKER_15]: And congratulations, Susanna, on being chosen for both the development of the Mass Dyslexia Guidelines and the Literacy Champions Committee.

1600
02:14:47,175 --> 02:14:47,575
[SPEAKER_15]: Good news.

1601
02:14:48,276 --> 02:14:49,117
[SPEAKER_15]: They're lucky to have you.

1602
02:14:53,398 --> 02:15:00,680
[SPEAKER_15]: I find this a lot to absorb, right, especially at this hour of the night after a long day as you all have had as well.

1603
02:15:02,061 --> 02:15:09,223
[SPEAKER_15]: But as you know, we have been hearing from community members, from family members as well, with concern over

1604
02:15:11,434 --> 02:15:15,337
[SPEAKER_15]: over dyslexia and I think that's been, you know, universal throughout the state.

1605
02:15:15,357 --> 02:15:24,023
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that's necessarily unique to Medford, but going towards the increased outreach for parent communication collaboration regarding screening and progress monitoring.

1606
02:15:24,583 --> 02:15:33,650
[SPEAKER_15]: I love seeing all of the data and training and professional development and everything you guys are doing with the staff in our schools and with the teachers and

1607
02:15:34,995 --> 02:15:37,496
[SPEAKER_15]: It's clearly a lot of work that's been happening.

1608
02:15:38,676 --> 02:16:02,563
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm feeling like, is there a way that we can engage our families more so that they're feeling like they're part of the process and that they're participating, they're feeling empowered, they're feeling like they're being brought along in the process and not necessarily told after the fact or, you know, in the middle of the fact or before the fact or whatever, because I'm sure as you know, being parents yourselves, right, that, or some of you being parents yourselves,

1609
02:16:03,208 --> 02:16:24,082
[SPEAKER_15]: when it comes to our children it gets very emotional and it's different as coming from a staff or administrative perspective when it's not your child because of the emotion level and I think if we if there's ways that we are thinking it does increase outreach for parent communication and collaboration I'm wondering what exactly that would be and I'm thinking back towards

1610
02:16:26,002 --> 02:16:37,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn's, you know, transition meetings with a lot of community members and those sort of sit downs where people were able to really talk and share and express their information and feelings and, you know, what they would like to see happen.

1611
02:16:37,785 --> 02:16:41,427
[SPEAKER_15]: I found them personally very enlightening and helpful.

1612
02:16:41,527 --> 02:16:45,568
[SPEAKER_15]: And I feel like hopefully those are just first steps and those conversations will continue.

1613
02:16:45,608 --> 02:16:50,349
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm excited about community collaboration at this level for our families.

1614
02:16:50,369 --> 02:16:52,850
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm wondering how can this be

1615
02:16:53,975 --> 02:16:58,677
[SPEAKER_15]: as comprehensive as clearly all of the rest of the report is.

1616
02:16:58,717 --> 02:17:04,399
[SPEAKER_15]: Like what next steps can we do to be able to make sure that our families are feeling really engaged?

1617
02:17:05,579 --> 02:17:08,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the very beginning, I think we were all on a learning curve.

1618
02:17:08,861 --> 02:17:14,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that because DESE still hasn't come out with the guidelines, we're still waiting for that.

1619
02:17:15,003 --> 02:17:16,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And that might take a while.

1620
02:17:16,263 --> 02:17:16,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1621
02:17:17,104 --> 02:17:20,365
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are at a point where I feel like we have a lot of information.

1622
02:17:20,985 --> 02:17:23,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we can begin looking at

1623
02:17:24,091 --> 02:17:27,354
[SPEAKER_03]: introducing this and having more family participation in this.

1624
02:17:27,394 --> 02:17:28,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll look into that.

1625
02:17:28,715 --> 02:17:29,535
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be really helpful.

1626
02:17:29,555 --> 02:17:36,761
[SPEAKER_15]: And does DESE offer any, it seems like, you know, they're always talking about family and community engagement from DESE perspective and it's one of the indicators, right?

1627
02:17:36,801 --> 02:17:41,565
[SPEAKER_15]: It's one of the things that we're supposed to be doing as a district and one of the things that we're supposed to be tracking for data.

1628
02:17:42,485 --> 02:17:48,550
[SPEAKER_15]: So do they offer any training that you guys are aware of or information or awareness or anything for families?

1629
02:17:49,047 --> 02:17:49,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know, Ms.

1630
02:17:49,887 --> 02:17:52,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Tarek is in the audience with us.

1631
02:17:52,968 --> 02:17:58,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I can certainly contact DESE and ask them if they offer anything for family and community engagement.

1632
02:17:58,630 --> 02:18:16,736
[SPEAKER_13]: I can offer one thing, just based on what I was hearing during the dyslexia stakeholders meeting, there was a lot of discussion about who are these guidelines really being written for, and the overwhelming voices in the room were saying that they're being written for everybody, so that they're really being written for

1633
02:18:17,515 --> 02:18:24,680
[SPEAKER_13]: administrators, teachers, parents, students themselves when they're at an age where that's appropriate.

1634
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:32,546
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that as we're kind of looking forward, that those guidelines coming from DESE will be including families.

1635
02:18:32,706 --> 02:18:33,927
[SPEAKER_13]: So to kind of respond to that.

1636
02:18:34,067 --> 02:18:34,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

1637
02:18:34,407 --> 02:18:39,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Since you're on the Massachusetts Guideline Committee, I would ask that you keep elevating that, right?

1638
02:18:39,411 --> 02:18:43,954
[SPEAKER_15]: That the students themselves and the families and community members are engaged in that way.

1639
02:18:45,170 --> 02:18:52,212
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that when you have buy-ins from families and when they feel like they're being valued, it helps the process move along more smoothly.

1640
02:18:52,292 --> 02:18:59,414
[SPEAKER_15]: Toward that end, I know that CPAC and I know that the co-chair of the Special Ed Parent Advisory Council is here tonight as well.

1641
02:18:59,834 --> 02:19:06,896
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that they did a presentation last year with families on dyslexia and educators on dyslexia.

1642
02:19:06,916 --> 02:19:09,017
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll be doing another one, I think, this year.

1643
02:19:09,037 --> 02:19:12,718
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll make sure that we get you all that information and that we hope teachers and

1644
02:19:13,699 --> 02:19:15,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Educators and central administration will come as well.

1645
02:19:15,881 --> 02:19:21,285
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great opportunity to bring families and employees and staff to the table together.

1646
02:19:22,506 --> 02:19:23,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Sounds like a plan, thank you.

1647
02:19:23,787 --> 02:19:23,947
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1648
02:19:24,208 --> 02:19:25,328
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I just add one thing too?

1649
02:19:25,388 --> 02:19:29,572
[SPEAKER_24]: I want us to be very careful in realizing, and I have talked to Ms.

1650
02:19:29,592 --> 02:19:33,194
[SPEAKER_24]: Tarka about this as well, that this is not just limited to dyslexia.

1651
02:19:33,234 --> 02:19:42,982
[SPEAKER_24]: This is an early literacy screener where we're looking at the potential for a neurological learning disability, but we're also able to identify our tier two students who may need intervention

1652
02:19:43,335 --> 02:19:45,696
[SPEAKER_24]: yet don't have that neurological disability.

1653
02:19:45,736 --> 02:19:56,623
[SPEAKER_24]: So I know that the name can sometimes be a bit of a misnomer, but I just want to make sure we're all on the same page when we're looking at this law, if that makes sense.

1654
02:19:57,964 --> 02:19:58,204
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1655
02:19:58,778 --> 02:20:00,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I just also wanted to add one thing.

1656
02:20:00,579 --> 02:20:08,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that communication between schools and families will become a lot more natural and a lot more easy once we know which tool is going to be ours.

1657
02:20:09,504 --> 02:20:13,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Because right now, we're still learning and we're still testing or piloting.

1658
02:20:13,747 --> 02:20:18,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we know which screener is going to be ours and which intervention tool is going to be ours, then I think that will come more naturally.

1659
02:20:19,444 --> 02:20:19,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1660
02:20:19,804 --> 02:20:31,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think it just, I think families also feel like it'd be great to have a voice in what those screeners and tools are because they're living it every day, right, with their children and with the children themselves being able to have a say in that.

1661
02:20:31,175 --> 02:20:36,439
[SPEAKER_15]: So really DESE should be considering that too and I'll be sure to bring it up to them as well.

1662
02:20:36,599 --> 02:20:36,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1663
02:20:38,280 --> 02:20:42,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Desi does have parents on their committee as stakeholders.

1664
02:20:42,962 --> 02:20:44,423
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are parents who are there.

1665
02:20:45,103 --> 02:20:46,524
[SPEAKER_13]: They have a variety of stakeholders.

1666
02:20:46,624 --> 02:20:53,547
[SPEAKER_13]: And in addition to that, they were looking for students who would want to come forward and talk about their own experiences.

1667
02:20:53,587 --> 02:20:55,287
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're also looking for a student voice.

1668
02:20:55,347 --> 02:20:57,388
[SPEAKER_13]: So there are people paying attention to that.

1669
02:20:57,809 --> 02:20:58,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

1670
02:20:58,089 --> 02:21:03,951
[SPEAKER_15]: And so if there are students or families in this community that are interested, could they get a hold of you to get that information to Desi?

1671
02:21:03,971 --> 02:21:05,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and I'd be happy to give that information to Desi.

1672
02:21:05,992 --> 02:21:06,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Absolutely.

1673
02:21:06,272 --> 02:21:06,752
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1674
02:21:07,013 --> 02:21:07,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1675
02:21:08,998 --> 02:21:09,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

1676
02:21:12,061 --> 02:21:13,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the report.

1677
02:21:13,021 --> 02:21:28,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if this is off topic or not, but I noticed in the ELA budget that we have no reading specialist for tier two at the high school.

1678
02:21:28,214 --> 02:21:28,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1679
02:21:28,634 --> 02:21:32,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And so for all the kids that none of this is going to help,

1680
02:21:34,449 --> 02:21:39,775
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering, so if they're tier three and they're in special ed, there are reading specialists at the high school?

1681
02:21:40,256 --> 02:21:40,977
[SPEAKER_24]: For tier three.

1682
02:21:41,177 --> 02:21:44,441
[SPEAKER_24]: A student on an IEP will receive services, yes.

1683
02:21:49,629 --> 02:21:57,155
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I guess I'm just, I guess one of the things that surprised me the most about this was that we don't have anybody at the high school for tier two.

1684
02:21:57,195 --> 02:21:59,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there really just, there's nobody for tier two?

1685
02:21:59,316 --> 02:22:07,222
[SPEAKER_24]: So what we've done, you're correct, there's no, at the middle school, and this was on my wish list, I mentioned this during our pre-budget, I think I mentioned it.

1686
02:22:07,282 --> 02:22:09,084
[SPEAKER_24]: It's so long ago, it feels like I've mentioned it.

1687
02:22:09,384 --> 02:22:10,425
[SPEAKER_24]: I know it's on my wish list.

1688
02:22:11,085 --> 02:22:14,968
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have two reading specialists, as I mentioned, at the middle school.

1689
02:22:15,378 --> 02:22:22,281
[SPEAKER_24]: that do not see students, mostly see students who are tier two, have the tier two needs.

1690
02:22:23,862 --> 02:22:25,963
[SPEAKER_24]: The high school, we do not have that.

1691
02:22:26,183 --> 02:22:35,808
[SPEAKER_24]: It is on my wish list to get two specialists there so that we can service the students who aren't on an IEP but still have gaps in their reading.

1692
02:22:37,269 --> 02:22:43,492
[SPEAKER_24]: What I have done, working with Mr. DeLeva, is taken the schedule and created

1693
02:22:44,065 --> 02:22:54,232
[SPEAKER_24]: some elective courses called Literacy Challenge, which do identify students who, through different measures.

1694
02:22:54,332 --> 02:23:03,219
[SPEAKER_24]: So perhaps they didn't do well on their MCAS, teacher recommendation of students who are struggling in reading and writing.

1695
02:23:03,619 --> 02:23:10,544
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we have something called Literacy Challenge, which instead of taking mythology course or any other mini,

1696
02:23:10,863 --> 02:23:18,710
[SPEAKER_24]: The students attend Literacy Challenge two out of the six days a week, and I work with the teachers to find ways to service the students.

1697
02:23:19,571 --> 02:23:23,334
[SPEAKER_24]: They do not work with reading specialists, and that would be the next step.

1698
02:23:23,434 --> 02:23:33,663
[SPEAKER_24]: So I've managed to get it in our schedule, which was a big step with the support of high school administration, but the next step would be having the experts in there.

1699
02:23:33,683 --> 02:23:35,205
[SPEAKER_24]: So yes.

1700
02:23:38,713 --> 02:23:39,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Superintendent.

1701
02:23:40,314 --> 02:23:47,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to thank the Dream Team, Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell, Dr. Chiesa, Ms.

1702
02:23:47,880 --> 02:23:48,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Campbell, and Ms.

1703
02:23:48,821 --> 02:23:52,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Champoli for spearheading all of this work together.

1704
02:23:53,004 --> 02:24:01,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, you're here making this presentation today, but what the school community hasn't been able to see is the

1705
02:24:01,630 --> 02:24:12,379
[SPEAKER_08]: hours that you guys have spent really looking at research, reaching out to other colleagues, and really trying to keep Medford at the forefront.

1706
02:24:13,921 --> 02:24:23,209
[SPEAKER_08]: We've said it many times that DESE has not yet given their final decision, and we are so grateful that Ms.

1707
02:24:23,229 --> 02:24:28,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Campbell is working closely with DESE and will be part of that team

1708
02:24:28,657 --> 02:24:30,879
[SPEAKER_08]: that makes the final recommendation for the state.

1709
02:24:31,340 --> 02:24:44,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we need to always keep that in mind that what we're doing hasn't officially been sanctioned yet by DESE, but we're doing something that's positive and we're getting good results.

1710
02:24:45,093 --> 02:24:48,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And the addition of ECRI and other things that we're trying to do

1711
02:24:49,386 --> 02:24:55,251
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of literacy, we are taking it seriously, and it is a priority for all of us.

1712
02:24:55,311 --> 02:25:00,896
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to continue to thank you for the hard work that you're doing on behalf of Medford Public Schools.

1713
02:25:01,817 --> 02:25:02,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1714
02:25:02,157 --> 02:25:03,598
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1715
02:25:03,638 --> 02:25:04,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Member van de Kloot.

1716
02:25:05,938 --> 02:25:17,490
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, and I realize that it is somewhat amusing that the Curriculum Subcommittee, which will speak to ECRI, has not yet been reported out yet, only because of the suspensions that we've had this evening.

1717
02:25:17,590 --> 02:25:20,233
[SPEAKER_19]: But we will get to it and explain a little more.

1718
02:25:21,935 --> 02:25:25,038
[SPEAKER_19]: So in the notes

1719
02:25:26,572 --> 02:25:37,079
[SPEAKER_19]: First results were given to parents for grade one and two in November, and then kindergarten parents have now, they've all received some results.

1720
02:25:37,659 --> 02:25:41,242
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm curious whether initially we were

1721
02:25:41,804 --> 02:25:47,466
[SPEAKER_19]: surprised at the number of kids, or it was what we expected, or no, it was lower than we expected.

1722
02:25:47,866 --> 02:25:49,747
[SPEAKER_19]: I was sort of curious about your initial reactions.

1723
02:25:50,207 --> 02:25:58,271
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I'm wondering if we have supports to help students right away who were red flagged in this process.

1724
02:26:00,732 --> 02:26:08,695
[SPEAKER_24]: In terms of the support, once the student was red flagged, we already had the win time blocked into the schedule.

1725
02:26:09,627 --> 02:26:20,837
[SPEAKER_24]: At the first grade and second grade level, we had already taken the literacy block before we did any of these screeners and created 20 to 30 minutes within the literacy block for specific intervention.

1726
02:26:21,237 --> 02:26:30,545
[SPEAKER_24]: So the data and the way in which the students were flagged at the time was through the WIN assessments as well as teacher input.

1727
02:26:31,045 --> 02:26:35,889
[SPEAKER_24]: With the screeners, we've been able to take that a step further because now we have even more solid data

1728
02:26:37,160 --> 02:26:39,201
[SPEAKER_24]: to show us the needs of the students.

1729
02:26:39,321 --> 02:27:00,789
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've been able to take the students who are showing some concerns in literacy and target their needs, whether they are using Lexia Core 5 in the classroom, whether they are using decoding power, which is another intervention tool that we use, or a variety of different interventions based on the child's needs.

1730
02:27:00,829 --> 02:27:06,671
[SPEAKER_24]: So in terms of time, we've been able, because it was already in there in the schedule, we were able to

1731
02:27:07,842 --> 02:27:08,882
[SPEAKER_24]: really move forward quickly.

1732
02:27:09,963 --> 02:27:13,684
[SPEAKER_24]: During that time also, we tend to have more all hands on deck.

1733
02:27:13,864 --> 02:27:24,307
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have more specialists, more teachers generally in the classroom, and the students mix together so that we can really pool our resources a little bit more.

1734
02:27:24,947 --> 02:27:30,588
[SPEAKER_24]: So the fact that it was already in there was very easy to make that intervention piece.

1735
02:27:30,929 --> 02:27:31,229
[SPEAKER_24]: Does that?

1736
02:27:31,629 --> 02:27:31,869
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1737
02:27:32,329 --> 02:27:35,850
[SPEAKER_19]: And how about what you're seeing initially?

1738
02:27:36,333 --> 02:27:40,196
[SPEAKER_24]: It varied initially based on just learning of the tool.

1739
02:27:40,696 --> 02:27:46,080
[SPEAKER_24]: So there were some red flags for students that we may not have been anticipating.

1740
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:54,626
[SPEAKER_24]: What we did see is some of that was because when Lexia Rapid tests, sometimes they test on what the child would look like at the end of the year.

1741
02:27:54,947 --> 02:28:00,811
[SPEAKER_24]: But we also saw gaps in some phonics, which we have begun to solve with the endorsement of ECRI.

1742
02:28:01,328 --> 02:28:13,781
[SPEAKER_24]: So we saw some deficits in those areas that we were expecting because of the win assessments from last year, but it was really important piece of data for us as we moved forward with our next steps.

1743
02:28:14,822 --> 02:28:22,050
[SPEAKER_19]: And then lastly, where then becomes the line where we determine that a student is

1744
02:28:23,584 --> 02:28:34,272
[SPEAKER_19]: is dyslexic or severely dyslexic so that they need more than classroom supports, but they need a specialized, maybe special education support.

1745
02:28:34,833 --> 02:28:35,894
[SPEAKER_24]: So I will let Ms.

1746
02:28:35,914 --> 02:28:51,366
[SPEAKER_24]: Champoli speak more to that, but I will add in we intervene, we screen to intervene, we intervene, and then we have the TAT team established as well if we start to feel that our interventions, the student is not progressing based on the interventions.

1747
02:28:52,807 --> 02:28:54,068
[SPEAKER_24]: more steps need to be taken.

1748
02:28:54,508 --> 02:28:55,589
[SPEAKER_24]: I will let Ms.

1749
02:28:55,609 --> 02:28:58,451
[SPEAKER_24]: Champulli maybe say a little bit more if I didn't as eloquently explain it.

1750
02:28:58,511 --> 02:28:59,931
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you described it really well.

1751
02:28:59,951 --> 02:29:01,212
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called response to intervention.

1752
02:29:01,272 --> 02:29:08,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So once a teacher has a concern, then they change, they differentiate their instruction within the classroom.

1753
02:29:08,657 --> 02:29:10,818
[SPEAKER_04]: They might bring in the TAT, a teacher assisted team.

1754
02:29:10,858 --> 02:29:12,479
[SPEAKER_04]: At some schools it's called STAT, TAT,

1755
02:29:13,199 --> 02:29:21,762
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a teacher assistance team where you implement an intervention, collect data, meet a few weeks later, see how that's going.

1756
02:29:22,563 --> 02:29:29,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not seeing the progress that you want to see, that's when a teacher would refer for a special education evaluation.

1757
02:29:29,565 --> 02:29:30,966
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, great.

1758
02:29:31,126 --> 02:29:31,946
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

1759
02:29:31,966 --> 02:29:32,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for all your work.

1760
02:29:34,007 --> 02:29:34,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

1761
02:29:35,678 --> 02:29:36,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1762
02:29:36,058 --> 02:29:39,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say thank you all very much for this really comprehensive report.

1763
02:29:40,302 --> 02:29:48,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first thing that I thought of when I read it was, you know, how proactively Medford jumped right in and immediately began working on this after the bill's inception.

1764
02:29:49,148 --> 02:29:53,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all the outlines that we see here just shows how busy you've been.

1765
02:29:53,732 --> 02:29:59,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Every month you've either been training, attending, professional development, screening.

1766
02:30:00,297 --> 02:30:02,058
[SPEAKER_09]: It just shows how much work you've been doing.

1767
02:30:02,078 --> 02:30:03,860
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to say thank you all very much.

1768
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:04,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all.

1769
02:30:06,224 --> 02:30:06,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham.

1770
02:30:08,046 --> 02:30:09,948
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you again.

1771
02:30:09,968 --> 02:30:21,982
[SPEAKER_22]: So a couple of things that strike me as I listened to the report and read it and it was actually helpful for you guys to say the same things again because there is a lot to digest here.

1772
02:30:22,996 --> 02:30:28,800
[SPEAKER_22]: A couple of things that just sort of jumped out at me, and that parents have asked me about personally.

1773
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:42,749
[SPEAKER_20]: One is that we're getting results, particularly with our kindergarten students, fairly early in the year, and we're not communicating to families until February when report requirements have come in for kindergarten.

1774
02:30:43,610 --> 02:30:49,754
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm just wondering if you have heard feedback about that from the community in terms of

1775
02:30:51,899 --> 02:31:11,012
[SPEAKER_22]: expecting more timely connection of my child was assessed and you saw X or Y or Z and then I found out about it versus if you found out something about my child in October, I wouldn't want to have to wait until February to know that there was something amiss there.

1776
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:22,086
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing we want to keep in mind with our kindergarten students in particular is that you want to give students a certain amount of time in the classroom to acclimate and to learn some skills.

1777
02:31:22,186 --> 02:31:29,030
[SPEAKER_13]: So many of the screeners actually dictate that they're not even given to kindergartners until January.

1778
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:34,293
[SPEAKER_13]: They wait a little bit so that students have a chance to kind of learn some of those skills that you're going to be assessing.

1779
02:31:34,872 --> 02:31:43,338
[SPEAKER_13]: because if you have a disability, you're provided with the instruction, but you're not responding to that instruction in the way that we would expect, rather than it's not really the skills you come in with.

1780
02:31:43,418 --> 02:31:45,139
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that that's one piece.

1781
02:31:45,199 --> 02:31:52,104
[SPEAKER_13]: I also think that as we move forward and we kind of lay out a plan of how we're going to screen and progress monitor and

1782
02:31:52,948 --> 02:32:01,610
[SPEAKER_13]: give information, we will have that kind of laid out in a way where parents are aware of what the schedule is, and we can be looking for feedback on that.

1783
02:32:01,990 --> 02:32:06,390
[SPEAKER_13]: I think during the pilot, it was really important that that first conversation was face-to-face.

1784
02:32:07,451 --> 02:32:21,433
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that that's the reason why we really wanted that first conversation to be teacher with a parent speaking about a child face-to-face, because this is one piece of information in a whole bunch of other information.

1785
02:32:22,401 --> 02:32:28,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Another thing about the kindergartners was that a lot of them weren't really familiar with how to use a computer-based test.

1786
02:32:28,383 --> 02:32:34,705
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there was a lot of information that might have come forward with that first screen, and it wasn't necessarily mirroring what the teachers were seeing.

1787
02:32:35,445 --> 02:32:40,127
[SPEAKER_13]: So being able to present that and saying, here's what this data shows, but here's what I'm seeing in class.

1788
02:32:40,827 --> 02:32:42,007
[SPEAKER_13]: These are my observations.

1789
02:32:42,128 --> 02:32:43,268
[SPEAKER_13]: It was part of a whole picture.

1790
02:32:44,090 --> 02:32:46,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wanted to add to that too.

1791
02:32:47,152 --> 02:32:51,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we have these screeners and they give us some concrete data, it's still one piece of a puzzle.

1792
02:32:52,436 --> 02:32:56,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So like Susanna said, what does it actually look like in day to day?

1793
02:32:57,099 --> 02:33:01,602
[SPEAKER_04]: There also is the initial screener at the beginning of the year that every kindergartner gets.

1794
02:33:02,142 --> 02:33:06,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they fail that screener, then parents are informed immediately and then re-screened.

1795
02:33:08,307 --> 02:33:10,088
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have that data at the beginning of the year too.

1796
02:33:11,529 --> 02:33:25,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I guess when I think about the sequencing, right, like I know we're kind of obligated to a timeline for conferences by teacher contract, but that timeline doesn't match up with any step in the assessment process.

1797
02:33:26,017 --> 02:33:27,738
[SPEAKER_22]: So it doesn't match up with the first one.

1798
02:33:28,478 --> 02:33:39,184
[SPEAKER_22]: So I can understand wanting ideally to have a face-to-face conversation, but now we've had kindergarten conferences and we're gonna finish that second assessment

1799
02:33:40,112 --> 02:33:41,313
[SPEAKER_22]: So we've missed it again.

1800
02:33:41,453 --> 02:33:44,694
[SPEAKER_22]: So what's that?

1801
02:33:44,894 --> 02:33:46,395
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be on the same schedule now.

1802
02:33:46,515 --> 02:33:55,320
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just the first round that the kindergarten actually had their conferences at the very beginning of February, I believe.

1803
02:33:55,360 --> 02:34:01,163
[SPEAKER_22]: But if the second assessment isn't due to be finished until this Friday, have you had the kindergarten?

1804
02:34:01,903 --> 02:34:02,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1805
02:34:02,683 --> 02:34:06,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So K-1-2 are now on the same schedule, yes.

1806
02:34:07,766 --> 02:34:09,187
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1807
02:34:10,564 --> 02:34:19,846
[SPEAKER_24]: Moving forward, now that that initial face-to-face explanation of this is one test, if your child was red flagged, we've now given another assessment.

1808
02:34:20,166 --> 02:34:23,507
[SPEAKER_24]: The assessment confirms this red flag or it dispels it.

1809
02:34:23,987 --> 02:34:26,107
[SPEAKER_24]: That first conversation was very important.

1810
02:34:26,508 --> 02:34:32,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Come second round, we are working to, we won't have a face-to-face conversation.

1811
02:34:32,609 --> 02:34:37,390
[SPEAKER_24]: We will report to the parents, but they will now be familiar with what the report looks like

1812
02:34:37,929 --> 02:34:40,090
[SPEAKER_24]: they'll have had a lot of their questions answered.

1813
02:34:40,150 --> 02:34:45,712
[SPEAKER_24]: Rather, we didn't want the first round to be, here's a piece of paper, and oh my goodness, I have four children.

1814
02:34:45,732 --> 02:34:50,973
[SPEAKER_24]: If I got that piece of paper and I said, wow, this is a problem, I would want to reach out to the teacher right away.

1815
02:34:51,333 --> 02:34:57,895
[SPEAKER_24]: Now that that's happened, the second round, we won't require that face-to-face, unless, of course, the parent would like it.

1816
02:34:57,996 --> 02:35:00,896
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think, therefore, it will roll out more quickly.

1817
02:35:00,976 --> 02:35:05,558
[SPEAKER_24]: We won't have to wait for that conference, because there won't be one.

1818
02:35:06,526 --> 02:35:07,347
[SPEAKER_24]: unless requested.

1819
02:35:07,768 --> 02:35:13,032
[SPEAKER_22]: So is there a timeline for that, for when the results from February will go home to families?

1820
02:35:13,292 --> 02:35:14,694
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I don't know the specific date.

1821
02:35:15,174 --> 02:35:33,150
[SPEAKER_24]: The testing concludes on Friday, and then we have a data analysis, I believe it's March 18th, with the teachers so that they understand the data, so that they understand the data, so that the administrators understand the data, and then we will take that information

1822
02:35:33,650 --> 02:35:39,234
[SPEAKER_24]: there with the report and also look at the other pieces we've assessed and send out a packet.

1823
02:35:39,274 --> 02:35:42,977
[SPEAKER_24]: But we have not finalized the exact date yet, but it will be coming.

1824
02:35:43,738 --> 02:35:44,018
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1825
02:35:44,739 --> 02:36:02,132
[SPEAKER_22]: And then just hearing this update and hearing about pre-budget, it sort of strikes me that there's like a bigger picture here, particularly as it relates to the budget, which is not just about what tool we use to screen.

1826
02:36:02,172 --> 02:36:03,233
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's really important.

1827
02:36:03,995 --> 02:36:17,319
[SPEAKER_22]: when you start screening, I think we probably expect to see a lot more children be identified earlier that may require services, which also potentially costs money.

1828
02:36:17,339 --> 02:36:26,703
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and then from there, um, we have our, you know, sort of the curriculum conversation that has started around ECRI and journeys and all that good stuff.

1829
02:36:27,123 --> 02:36:30,524
[SPEAKER_22]: But then we also have this whole pile of kids,

1830
02:36:31,298 --> 02:36:42,603
[SPEAKER_22]: who are like out of the cycle of an initial assessment being able to catch those challenges early and remediate them, and they may be in six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

1831
02:36:43,303 --> 02:36:50,706
[SPEAKER_22]: So what is our plan to sort of identify those children and do what we need to do to remediate them?

1832
02:36:50,746 --> 02:36:59,490
[SPEAKER_22]: So it just strikes me that there's this bigger conversation around literacy and the costs we need to anticipate both

1833
02:37:00,098 --> 02:37:03,200
[SPEAKER_22]: this year and into the future that we need to have.

1834
02:37:04,321 --> 02:37:11,787
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm told by lots of people that there's lots of support all over the city, including at our city council for support of the money that is needed.

1835
02:37:11,807 --> 02:37:21,155
[SPEAKER_22]: And that is super exciting to me, but I feel like we do have to lay that out somehow so that we can start to have a meaningful conversation around what it,

1836
02:37:21,913 --> 02:37:28,835
[SPEAKER_22]: What are all the, like, if there's 100 parts, which parts of the 100 parts are we dealing with this year, and where do we go from there?

1837
02:37:28,875 --> 02:37:35,676
[SPEAKER_22]: So how do we, when do you sort of plan to tell us what the data's telling us, and when do we have that conversation, I guess is my question.

1838
02:37:35,716 --> 02:37:40,477
[SPEAKER_24]: So first of all, so we have to kind of take it step by step, right, because there are a lot of pieces.

1839
02:37:40,537 --> 02:37:46,718
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have to really, really thorough and thoughtful in how we address it at the different school levels.

1840
02:37:47,078 --> 02:37:48,359
[SPEAKER_24]: So you mentioned six, seven, and eight.

1841
02:37:48,739 --> 02:37:49,819
[SPEAKER_24]: So six, seven, and eight,

1842
02:37:50,260 --> 02:37:53,503
[SPEAKER_24]: already has a clear pathway for identification.

1843
02:37:53,523 --> 02:38:02,530
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm strictly speaking about tier two, so I'm not talking about the students on IEPs, but our children that still have gaps in literacy.

1844
02:38:03,010 --> 02:38:19,423
[SPEAKER_24]: Come fifth grade, moving into sixth, we have a series of, we have a formula that uses study island data, uses MCAS scores, uses the F&P from grade five, but also uses different tools

1845
02:38:19,913 --> 02:38:30,478
[SPEAKER_24]: that the fifth grade teacher has seen to recommend the child for that tier two middle school reading specialist that I just spoke to with Mr. Rousseau.

1846
02:38:31,139 --> 02:38:35,681
[SPEAKER_24]: When the child enters into sixth grade, we have their study island data.

1847
02:38:36,362 --> 02:38:38,202
[SPEAKER_24]: That was mentioned in my pre-budget report as well.

1848
02:38:38,222 --> 02:38:40,504
[SPEAKER_24]: We usually attain that through a grant.

1849
02:38:41,544 --> 02:38:43,445
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see if we can get it through the grant as well.

1850
02:38:43,785 --> 02:38:46,867
[SPEAKER_24]: That's given in math and English, and it's the same process.

1851
02:38:47,187 --> 02:38:48,768
[SPEAKER_24]: There are a certain set of standards

1852
02:38:49,258 --> 02:38:55,280
[SPEAKER_24]: that the child needs to perform at a certain level for, and if they don't, they're red flagged at the middle school.

1853
02:38:55,620 --> 02:39:07,045
[SPEAKER_24]: We then take those group of students and we place them into, we talk with the parents, you know, get approval, make sure they want it, and we place them into that with our reading specialists for six, seven, and eight.

1854
02:39:07,405 --> 02:39:11,347
[SPEAKER_24]: In the past, we used to have reading skills for everybody.

1855
02:39:11,547 --> 02:39:16,529
[SPEAKER_24]: So we had our top readers with our struggling readers getting a reading skills class.

1856
02:39:17,988 --> 02:39:29,476
[SPEAKER_24]: decided we had to do was make efficient use of our resources and say, it would be great if everybody could get reading, but we know we have a really small, we have a, not a small group, we have a group that really needs small instruction.

1857
02:39:29,836 --> 02:39:34,739
[SPEAKER_24]: So middle school, we do have a process for identifying and intervening.

1858
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:46,507
[SPEAKER_24]: And as you can see from my pre-budget report, I did provide some different resources I want to continue with, like the Lexia Power Up and the iLit and the Read Naturally, a few different programs.

1859
02:39:47,313 --> 02:39:49,414
[SPEAKER_24]: based on the needs of the child, so we can really personalize it.

1860
02:39:49,755 --> 02:39:53,757
[SPEAKER_24]: So middle school, we're in very good shape.

1861
02:39:55,138 --> 02:40:06,904
[SPEAKER_24]: When you bring up budget, which I'm very glad you did, when we think about the assessment and the screener for K1 and 2, we do need to plan accordingly within the budget.

1862
02:40:07,465 --> 02:40:16,730
[SPEAKER_24]: Medford has been extremely proactive with your support in terms of assessing earlier than a lot of other districts are doing, and I think that's a really great thing, and I think you can see it's really

1863
02:40:17,218 --> 02:40:21,520
[SPEAKER_24]: propelled us to take a lot of steps in literacy beyond just screening.

1864
02:40:22,260 --> 02:40:24,601
[SPEAKER_24]: So we do need to anticipate that cost.

1865
02:40:25,121 --> 02:40:34,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Unless this pilot continues on another year, which I don't anticipate, we are looking at a cost for whichever screener we choose.

1866
02:40:34,425 --> 02:40:35,886
[SPEAKER_24]: And that is not in my budget.

1867
02:40:35,986 --> 02:40:41,469
[SPEAKER_24]: That was a potential separate line item.

1868
02:40:41,949 --> 02:40:46,951
[SPEAKER_24]: And then in grades three, four, and five, we have a series of benchmarks.

1869
02:40:48,093 --> 02:40:59,898
[SPEAKER_24]: to work with the students and the title one and grade three also have a set of criteria so that they can close, they can identify those red flags and work with the students.

1870
02:41:00,858 --> 02:41:16,884
[SPEAKER_24]: The high school, we follow a similar path that middle school does, we just don't have study island, but we follow a similar path with recommendations, MCAS results, performances on our common assessments to put them in the literacy challenge classes.

1871
02:41:17,707 --> 02:41:21,728
[SPEAKER_24]: So does that help with the secondary level, and then with the elementary?

1872
02:41:21,748 --> 02:41:22,028
[SPEAKER_24]: It does.

1873
02:41:22,209 --> 02:41:24,189
[SPEAKER_24]: We do need to keep that in mind with budget, though.

1874
02:41:24,229 --> 02:41:25,550
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm very glad you brought that up.

1875
02:41:25,890 --> 02:41:36,873
[SPEAKER_24]: The other thing, too, is as you meet with the elementary principals, and I put it on my budget as well, that Lexia Core 5 and Lexia Power Up is expensive, but also been very well received.

1876
02:41:37,314 --> 02:41:43,116
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think it's something that I would encourage you to strongly consider during budget time for our students in need.

1877
02:41:43,336 --> 02:41:43,536
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1878
02:41:43,656 --> 02:41:47,317
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think the other, when I think of the big literacy picture,

1879
02:41:48,618 --> 02:41:59,522
[SPEAKER_22]: It also includes what's happening with our tier three students who are not in your budget, but they're in the special ed budget, but they're sort of all wrapped up in this conversation, right?

1880
02:41:59,702 --> 02:42:03,103
[SPEAKER_22]: In some way, shape, or form, because we're talking about literacy and we're talking about

1881
02:42:03,547 --> 02:42:06,348
[SPEAKER_22]: what tools are we using to remediate and all of that good stuff.

1882
02:42:06,368 --> 02:42:11,269
[SPEAKER_22]: So when I think about like that need for that bigger picture, that's a whole other facet.

1883
02:42:11,409 --> 02:42:18,651
[SPEAKER_22]: I would include in my mind that has to be included if we're talking about literacy, whether it's, you know, whoever's budgeted ends up.

1884
02:42:18,671 --> 02:42:18,891
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

1885
02:42:19,031 --> 02:42:20,792
[SPEAKER_22]: So I feel like we need to have that conversation.

1886
02:42:20,812 --> 02:42:24,673
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know where we would have that conversation, but I think it's really important.

1887
02:42:24,813 --> 02:42:28,994
[SPEAKER_24]: The other great piece, we had Dr. Gob here last year,

1888
02:42:29,498 --> 02:42:43,563
[SPEAKER_24]: do a presentation about intervening early and the benefits of intervening early to remediate and to fill in those deficits before we get into a situation where it's been too prolonged.

1889
02:42:43,663 --> 02:42:50,746
[SPEAKER_24]: So this screening and this intervening is a very important step that Medford's taking as we move forward.

1890
02:42:50,786 --> 02:42:58,929
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think just like sort of any process when this happens, these bubble years are going to be years where we're having to

1891
02:42:59,302 --> 02:43:04,644
[SPEAKER_22]: do many things, and if we can see to the other side of it, things get better.

1892
02:43:04,664 --> 02:43:07,466
[SPEAKER_22]: But for right now, we do have a lot ahead of us.

1893
02:43:07,526 --> 02:43:15,049
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, I'm not exactly sure if that's a curriculum subcommittee conversation to have, which is possible.

1894
02:43:15,129 --> 02:43:22,312
[SPEAKER_22]: But I really want us to have that sort of broader literacy conversation so that when we're making decisions about the budget,

1895
02:43:23,493 --> 02:43:26,597
[SPEAKER_22]: we sort of can do that with that whole picture in mind.

1896
02:43:26,717 --> 02:43:27,758
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that would be wonderful.

1897
02:43:27,838 --> 02:43:36,027
[SPEAKER_24]: For example, when we had the ECRI and we talked about not just the Tier 1 materials, but the Tier 2 as well, that's an important piece of this as we move forward.

1898
02:43:36,088 --> 02:43:36,969
[SPEAKER_24]: So yeah, that was great.

1899
02:43:37,609 --> 02:43:37,890
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1900
02:43:38,390 --> 02:43:38,650
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

1901
02:43:39,992 --> 02:43:40,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

1902
02:43:41,763 --> 02:43:42,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, thank you.

1903
02:43:43,404 --> 02:43:46,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in a follow-up to earlier, two things.

1904
02:43:46,986 --> 02:43:48,107
[SPEAKER_15]: One is I forgot to ask.

1905
02:43:48,908 --> 02:44:04,018
[SPEAKER_15]: It was brought to my attention as well by community members that there was a motion made and accepted last year at school committee apparently to do consultation with the landmark school.

1906
02:44:05,058 --> 02:44:10,282
[SPEAKER_15]: It was made by Aaron DiBenedetto, I guess, and seconded by Paulette.

1907
02:44:11,122 --> 02:44:15,025
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm wondering if that has occurred, and if not, when that can occur.

1908
02:44:15,325 --> 02:44:16,126
[SPEAKER_24]: I can speak to that.

1909
02:44:16,866 --> 02:44:25,852
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Benedetto asked me to reach out to Andover Public Schools, which was a school that Dr. Gobb had referenced, as well as the landmark consulting services.

1910
02:44:26,413 --> 02:44:28,955
[SPEAKER_24]: I did make contact with Andover Public Schools.

1911
02:44:29,815 --> 02:44:37,540
[SPEAKER_24]: They have not implemented a screener like we have, but I did reach out to them for their different steps, because they're doing a lot of good screening as well.

1912
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:39,862
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not part of the DESE pilot, to my knowledge.

1913
02:44:40,587 --> 02:44:42,868
[SPEAKER_24]: And we also reached out to Landmark Consulting Services.

1914
02:44:42,908 --> 02:44:43,528
[SPEAKER_24]: And I believe Ms.

1915
02:44:43,588 --> 02:44:48,770
[SPEAKER_24]: Bowen also followed up or had some conversations as well, although I don't want to speak for her.

1916
02:44:49,090 --> 02:44:55,833
[SPEAKER_24]: But I did reach out to them as well, their consulting side, to look at their models and their screeners as well.

1917
02:44:56,153 --> 02:44:59,694
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was done back in, I believe that was a motion made in May, if I'm not mistaken.

1918
02:44:59,934 --> 02:45:01,775
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think it was done the following week.

1919
02:45:02,195 --> 02:45:02,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, good.

1920
02:45:02,615 --> 02:45:02,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1921
02:45:03,016 --> 02:45:04,956
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was helpful, the consultation with Landmark?

1922
02:45:04,976 --> 02:45:05,677
[SPEAKER_24]: It was very helpful.

1923
02:45:05,717 --> 02:45:09,538
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, it's nice to make contact where Dr. Gobb had referenced Andover a few times.

1924
02:45:09,965 --> 02:45:11,486
[SPEAKER_24]: I also reach out to North Andover.

1925
02:45:11,947 --> 02:45:14,549
[SPEAKER_24]: It's helpful to see we're all on the front line.

1926
02:45:14,569 --> 02:45:16,190
[SPEAKER_24]: We're all doing this for the students.

1927
02:45:16,470 --> 02:45:23,516
[SPEAKER_24]: We really benefit when we pool our resources and talk to others, whether it's the landmark school or another public school.

1928
02:45:23,916 --> 02:45:24,937
[SPEAKER_24]: I found it very helpful.

1929
02:45:25,097 --> 02:45:25,317
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1930
02:45:25,778 --> 02:45:26,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1931
02:45:26,158 --> 02:45:34,405
[SPEAKER_15]: And so also, I know we haven't gotten to the curriculum subcommittee minutes yet, but it is informative and related to ECRI.

1932
02:45:35,285 --> 02:45:53,169
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that Member van de Kloot had asked in that committee meeting about, asked Director Paltisera for the EL, whether the ECRI program would be used for EL students, and he explained that it will be used and provides an excellent resource, so getting again, which is great, I'm glad to hear that.

1933
02:45:53,329 --> 02:45:59,431
[SPEAKER_15]: But also to Member Graham's comment, which is much appreciated about

1934
02:46:00,491 --> 02:46:04,934
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, really remembering the Tier 3 students and looking at literacy for all.

1935
02:46:04,994 --> 02:46:07,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that also applicable for the Tier 3, the ECRI?

1936
02:46:08,136 --> 02:46:09,457
[SPEAKER_24]: ECRI is Tier 1 and Tier 2.

1937
02:46:10,057 --> 02:46:10,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1938
02:46:10,477 --> 02:46:12,178
[SPEAKER_15]: So they, yeah, please.

1939
02:46:12,578 --> 02:46:16,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Students who receive Tier 3 are still part of the general education curriculum.

1940
02:46:16,621 --> 02:46:17,041
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course.

1941
02:46:17,401 --> 02:46:22,164
[SPEAKER_13]: So they would also be receiving Tier 1 in addition, just to be clear about that.

1942
02:46:22,384 --> 02:46:27,027
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you had a student who may be receiving special education,

1943
02:46:27,807 --> 02:46:34,094
[SPEAKER_13]: for decoding outside of the classroom setting, they would still be receiving reading instruction in their classroom setting.

1944
02:46:34,475 --> 02:46:36,577
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why it's important to align everything.

1945
02:46:36,877 --> 02:46:46,789
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are thinking about that and how this all interweaves together so that students are getting similar instruction and building upon that and not getting two very different programs that are confusing to them.

1946
02:46:47,405 --> 02:46:47,625
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1947
02:46:48,545 --> 02:46:57,208
[SPEAKER_15]: So, right, because every student's a general education student, and some students are receiving special education supports and services, to what Member Graham was saying.

1948
02:46:57,228 --> 02:47:00,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, our special education teachers are going to be part of that professional development as well.

1949
02:47:01,689 --> 02:47:01,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1950
02:47:01,909 --> 02:47:06,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though it's a Tier 1 and Tier 2, the Tier 3 service providers are going to be part of the professional development.

1951
02:47:06,931 --> 02:47:07,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, because, sure.

1952
02:47:07,391 --> 02:47:09,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, yeah, so it's an approach that can be carried.

1953
02:47:10,572 --> 02:47:10,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1954
02:47:11,567 --> 02:47:12,688
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, between tiers.

1955
02:47:12,748 --> 02:47:16,369
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I move back into tier one, right.

1956
02:47:16,789 --> 02:47:19,791
[SPEAKER_15]: And do paraprofessionals attend that PDA as well?

1957
02:47:20,531 --> 02:47:21,652
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not.

1958
02:47:21,712 --> 02:47:23,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Volpe has something else planned for them.

1959
02:47:24,553 --> 02:47:32,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure that if they're working with their teachers, their teachers will help them understand how to use ECRI or any of the screeners that we use.

1960
02:47:33,337 --> 02:47:33,657
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

1961
02:47:33,777 --> 02:47:34,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1962
02:47:35,598 --> 02:47:35,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1963
02:47:36,578 --> 02:47:39,540
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for, I don't know if there's any other questions.

1964
02:47:41,533 --> 02:47:41,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1965
02:47:44,375 --> 02:47:59,365
[SPEAKER_16]: We have recommendation to approve strategic prevention framework, partnerships for success, grant letter of commitment, Marion O'Connor and Ms.

1966
02:47:59,385 --> 02:47:59,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Penny Fanone.

1967
02:48:00,568 --> 02:48:01,269
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, how are you?

1968
02:48:01,289 --> 02:48:02,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your patience.

1969
02:48:02,470 --> 02:48:04,531
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for having us here today.

1970
02:48:04,571 --> 02:48:06,633
[SPEAKER_23]: We really appreciate you hearing this.

1971
02:48:06,673 --> 02:48:10,356
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a short turnaround, so again, really thankful that you're listening.

1972
02:48:10,657 --> 02:48:18,263
[SPEAKER_23]: Marion O'Connor is still on vacation, so I am speaking on behalf of the Office of Health and the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

1973
02:48:18,844 --> 02:48:23,948
[SPEAKER_23]: We are applying to a federal grant from Substance Abuse and Mental Health

1974
02:48:24,675 --> 02:48:27,858
[SPEAKER_23]: Administration called the Partnerships for Success Grant.

1975
02:48:27,898 --> 02:48:30,860
[SPEAKER_23]: It's called the Strategic Prevention Partnerships for Success Grant.

1976
02:48:32,482 --> 02:48:34,563
[SPEAKER_23]: We are looking at this funding.

1977
02:48:34,583 --> 02:48:37,626
[SPEAKER_23]: This funding will provide for two positions should we get it.

1978
02:48:38,006 --> 02:48:49,876
[SPEAKER_23]: It's very difficult to get a federal grant, but we are going to keep trying and continue to work on getting those applications out because they're really good investments in the community.

1979
02:48:50,177 --> 02:48:52,919
[SPEAKER_23]: We saw that with our Drug-Free Communities Grant.

1980
02:48:53,242 --> 02:48:59,865
[SPEAKER_23]: in 2004 until 2014, and our STOP Act grant, which was 2012 to 2016.

1981
02:49:00,825 --> 02:49:15,892
[SPEAKER_23]: So this grant application that we're applying for, it's to reduce, it's, excuse me, to prevent the onset, reduce the misuse of substances amongst youth, and its related problems.

1982
02:49:16,332 --> 02:49:22,495
[SPEAKER_23]: It also requires that we understand adult substance use as well, and to look at that as a

1983
02:49:23,049 --> 02:49:33,398
[SPEAKER_23]: as a particular factor in youth substance use and just in substance use in general and overall looking at behavioral health as a whole and not seeing these things as separate from.

1984
02:49:34,819 --> 02:49:40,804
[SPEAKER_23]: So what we thought we heard from our community and to that last year.

1985
02:49:41,143 --> 02:49:42,264
[SPEAKER_23]: We had a big process.

1986
02:49:42,304 --> 02:49:43,625
[SPEAKER_23]: We worked with Medford Health Matters.

1987
02:49:43,986 --> 02:49:46,548
[SPEAKER_23]: We held a series of big table sessions.

1988
02:49:47,068 --> 02:49:53,794
[SPEAKER_23]: Almost everybody was there, sitting in front of me, had attended at least one or two or more of those sessions.

1989
02:49:54,034 --> 02:49:58,959
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we invited in some representatives from the Citywide PTO.

1990
02:49:59,319 --> 02:50:02,302
[SPEAKER_23]: And as well, we've also been noticing the CPAC

1991
02:50:02,762 --> 02:50:04,144
[SPEAKER_23]: work with it with parents.

1992
02:50:04,404 --> 02:50:08,249
[SPEAKER_23]: So what we want to do with this grant is we want to really focus on families.

1993
02:50:08,569 --> 02:50:15,277
[SPEAKER_23]: We want to work on parent education that looks at the prevention and the onset of substance use.

1994
02:50:15,337 --> 02:50:15,518
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

1995
02:50:15,558 --> 02:50:19,983
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're really looking at that developmental understanding your child from 10 to 18 and

1996
02:50:20,984 --> 02:50:38,438
[SPEAKER_23]: and that adolescent stage what does that look like for families understand how substance misuse affects young people and the family system and then really looking at like how can we bring in programming that's going to target families who have current substance use in the family.

1997
02:50:38,913 --> 02:50:46,319
[SPEAKER_23]: So the premise of this grant will ultimately be to build out programming from the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

1998
02:50:46,720 --> 02:50:58,250
[SPEAKER_23]: We would like to see a sustained, this is a five-year grant, we would like to see a sustained program of an evidence-based program such as Strengthening Families, which has been many, many

1999
02:50:59,156 --> 02:51:08,559
[SPEAKER_23]: 20 plus years of, I don't want to, that's not on the record, 10 more, 10 or more years of evidence-based programming that is nationally recognized.

2000
02:51:08,899 --> 02:51:16,241
[SPEAKER_23]: And then looking at other programs that will be very, very specialized to families who have substance use in their family.

2001
02:51:16,541 --> 02:51:19,182
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's one that we're looking at called Celebrating Families.

2002
02:51:20,382 --> 02:51:21,902
[SPEAKER_23]: We are currently writing this grant.

2003
02:51:22,543 --> 02:51:27,644
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a really difficult process, as I'm sure you can imagine.

2004
02:51:28,584 --> 02:51:31,565
[SPEAKER_23]: So I don't have the actual document to share with you.

2005
02:51:31,725 --> 02:51:33,085
[SPEAKER_23]: It is due on March 6th.

2006
02:51:33,425 --> 02:51:38,847
[SPEAKER_23]: Ideally, we would be submitting at the midweek next week.

2007
02:51:39,287 --> 02:51:43,628
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is a lot to ask to turn around a letter of commitment.

2008
02:51:44,068 --> 02:51:46,849
[SPEAKER_23]: The draft letter that was submitted is a draft.

2009
02:51:47,029 --> 02:51:47,949
[SPEAKER_23]: It is up to

2010
02:51:48,533 --> 02:51:52,234
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, if you like it, you don't like it, we want to adjust it.

2011
02:51:52,294 --> 02:51:53,095
[SPEAKER_23]: That's up to you all.

2012
02:51:53,115 --> 02:51:54,635
[SPEAKER_23]: We're not prescribing this.

2013
02:51:55,275 --> 02:52:02,218
[SPEAKER_23]: But we will also be asking the public school administration for a letter to carry forth a number of the activities that we've been doing over the years.

2014
02:52:02,278 --> 02:52:10,480
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, let me just say first, we've been working a lot over the last 15 years together on substance abuse prevention.

2015
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:12,481
[SPEAKER_23]: We want to keep doing the good work that we're doing.

2016
02:52:13,101 --> 02:52:16,522
[SPEAKER_23]: And that includes data-driven initiatives.

2017
02:52:16,562 --> 02:52:18,043
[SPEAKER_23]: That includes data collection.

2018
02:52:18,721 --> 02:52:22,502
[SPEAKER_23]: And so, I do have a copy if anyone needs a copy of this.

2019
02:52:23,503 --> 02:52:24,143
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, sorry.

2020
02:52:25,623 --> 02:52:34,906
[SPEAKER_23]: I have more copies actually.

2021
02:52:37,946 --> 02:52:46,288
[SPEAKER_23]: So effectively, what we're asking for is to be able to come and meet with you a couple times a year to tell you what's going on with prevention, what's going on with the parent programming.

2022
02:52:46,649 --> 02:52:56,411
[SPEAKER_23]: We want to make connections, ultimately, with parent organizations and leverage your work in the community to kind of accentuate that.

2023
02:52:56,471 --> 02:53:04,934
[SPEAKER_23]: And then also, in any committees that you may be putting forth that involve substance use or behavioral health, we would like to be a part of that.

2024
02:53:05,954 --> 02:53:10,579
[SPEAKER_23]: And the grant requirement is that it's a letter of commitment.

2025
02:53:11,060 --> 02:53:17,446
[SPEAKER_23]: So it does have to be awarded in that way for us to make it a viable, you know, worth our time here today.

2026
02:53:17,486 --> 02:53:19,909
[SPEAKER_23]: So, okay, I'll stop.

2027
02:53:22,051 --> 02:53:22,772
[SPEAKER_23]: Member McLaughlin.

2028
02:53:24,501 --> 02:53:24,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2029
02:53:25,781 --> 02:53:27,042
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm excited to hear this.

2030
02:53:27,382 --> 02:53:34,284
[SPEAKER_15]: I am the chair of the Subcommittee on Behavioral Health and Special Education and Pupil Services.

2031
02:53:34,544 --> 02:53:45,328
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am excited by this and will look forward to working with you, assuming that we will have a motion to accept.

2032
02:53:45,448 --> 02:53:49,129
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think our member Rousseau had a question before we do that.

2033
02:53:49,189 --> 02:53:51,170
[SPEAKER_15]: But thank you very much for this presentation.

2034
02:53:51,190 --> 02:53:52,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Very exciting, much needed.

2035
02:53:53,871 --> 02:54:05,346
[SPEAKER_15]: We really appreciate all the work your office is doing in really saving our children and getting that information out there for families and helping folks understand illness that substance abuse is.

2036
02:54:06,247 --> 02:54:06,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2037
02:54:06,828 --> 02:54:07,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2038
02:54:08,050 --> 02:54:08,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

2039
02:54:08,691 --> 02:54:09,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me.

2040
02:54:09,572 --> 02:54:09,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2041
02:54:12,998 --> 02:54:34,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Just reviewing the letter, we will have to be cautious because, well, you will have to work very closely with Nurse Ray, because we did approve last year a research project that is ongoing that very much involves a lot of this stuff, and we want to not damage their project.

2042
02:54:35,540 --> 02:54:37,821
[SPEAKER_07]: their research that has already begun.

2043
02:54:37,841 --> 02:54:41,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I know my son was screened through that research recently.

2044
02:54:43,123 --> 02:54:44,503
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know you can handle all that.

2045
02:54:44,563 --> 02:54:47,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to make a motion to approve.

2046
02:54:47,404 --> 02:54:47,704
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

2047
02:54:48,725 --> 02:54:53,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

2048
02:54:53,866 --> 02:54:56,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here and thank you for waiting so long.

2049
02:54:58,448 --> 02:54:59,288
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2050
02:54:59,308 --> 02:55:00,969
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2051
02:55:01,209 --> 02:55:02,029
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like a roll call?

2052
02:55:02,389 --> 02:55:03,990
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call vote has been requested.

2053
02:55:17,580 --> 02:55:20,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, 6 in the affirmative, 1 absent, the paper passes.

2054
02:55:20,361 --> 02:55:25,123
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that we're going to table a few things.

2055
02:55:25,243 --> 02:55:28,845
[SPEAKER_16]: It's getting late, but we need to do a report on fundraising organizations.

2056
02:55:31,466 --> 02:55:32,707
[SPEAKER_16]: I can read it if you want me to read it.

2057
02:55:37,729 --> 02:55:38,269
[SPEAKER_16]: by Ms.

2058
02:55:38,349 --> 02:55:39,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Emily Lazzaro.

2059
02:55:39,390 --> 02:55:40,031
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2060
02:55:40,131 --> 02:55:40,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

2061
02:55:43,673 --> 02:55:44,654
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have the report.

2062
02:55:44,774 --> 02:55:47,916
[SPEAKER_10]: It's similar to last year's, just updated.

2063
02:55:47,936 --> 02:55:53,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I added on your desks, it's a fluid document.

2064
02:55:53,600 --> 02:56:00,304
[SPEAKER_10]: It had some new information that I was able to fill in since I wrote the report and put it in the folders and now it's today.

2065
02:56:01,045 --> 02:56:05,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the report or about the practice of

2066
02:56:07,295 --> 02:56:12,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Attempting to keep track of the 501c3s that operate to benefit the schools in Medford.

2067
02:56:15,050 --> 02:56:16,553
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2068
02:56:17,074 --> 02:56:17,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin.

2069
02:56:18,705 --> 02:56:20,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for this, Emily.

2070
02:56:21,026 --> 02:56:26,409
[SPEAKER_15]: I was noting earlier that the Special Education Parent Advisory Council was not on this list.

2071
02:56:26,589 --> 02:56:30,791
[SPEAKER_15]: And as the former co-chair, I know last year we were asked to provide this reporting as well.

2072
02:56:31,971 --> 02:56:33,632
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do raise money.

2073
02:56:34,032 --> 02:56:42,136
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that we're under a different entity because of the legal requirement that the state has to have a CPAC in every one of their districts.

2074
02:56:42,256 --> 02:56:47,599
[SPEAKER_15]: But we also have provided this information, so I'm assuming that

2075
02:56:47,909 --> 02:56:51,073
[SPEAKER_15]: We are not a 501c3, but I assume that we need to be on this list.

2076
02:56:51,313 --> 02:56:52,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can absolutely add you.

2077
02:56:52,494 --> 02:57:00,163
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a section on the bottom for other organizations, and since CPAC doesn't fit exactly in with the first two, I can add it there on the bottom.

2078
02:57:00,183 --> 02:57:00,984
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be helpful.

2079
02:57:01,064 --> 02:57:01,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2080
02:57:01,725 --> 02:57:01,885
Sure.

2081
02:57:02,566 --> 02:57:02,686
Great.

2082
02:57:03,046 --> 02:57:03,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2083
02:57:03,807 --> 02:57:04,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

2084
02:57:04,869 --> 02:57:06,290
[SPEAKER_07]: I just thank you for the report.

2085
02:57:08,247 --> 02:57:13,872
[SPEAKER_07]: The letter that you put in the front, there was a point about that they're not required by law to provide this information.

2086
02:57:14,292 --> 02:57:15,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is, of course, true.

2087
02:57:15,814 --> 02:57:20,818
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are required per the policy of the member public schools to provide this information.

2088
02:57:21,479 --> 02:57:31,447
[SPEAKER_07]: And while that is not legally binding, the remedy if they decide they don't want to provide this information is that we can say they can't use our facilities or the school's names.

2089
02:57:33,062 --> 02:57:36,025
[SPEAKER_07]: they are really required to provide this information.

2090
02:57:36,165 --> 02:57:44,612
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know if there's anybody who's not doing it, but that sounded a bit like, if you feel like doing it, do it.

2091
02:57:45,072 --> 02:57:51,637
[SPEAKER_07]: When in fact, we were much more clear that this is not optional for anybody that's associated with our schools.

2092
02:57:52,618 --> 02:57:55,120
[SPEAKER_07]: The list should really probably be three times as long.

2093
02:57:55,781 --> 02:57:58,083
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have not gotten to the point where we've kind of

2094
02:57:59,142 --> 02:58:03,304
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, thrown down the gauntlet on getting people to do this.

2095
02:58:03,424 --> 02:58:10,787
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're raising money and you're using our school's names or our facilities, you need to be on this list.

2096
02:58:10,947 --> 02:58:13,209
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not an ask.

2097
02:58:14,349 --> 02:58:14,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

2098
02:58:15,069 --> 02:58:20,652
[SPEAKER_10]: In the same sense that every time somebody wants to distribute a flyer in the schools, they have to get

2099
02:58:21,369 --> 02:58:36,658
[SPEAKER_10]: the approval of the superintendent, or they're not permitted to distribute the flyer, I can share with you whose updated financial information has been received by our office, and then you can do with it as a committee as you would like.

2100
02:58:37,839 --> 02:58:48,705
[SPEAKER_10]: But the intention of the letter was to say that the form that requests financial information from the 501c3 organizations was sent out,

2101
02:58:49,684 --> 02:58:54,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Some responses were received, and this is the updated document as I have it.

2102
02:58:55,526 --> 02:58:55,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2103
02:58:57,266 --> 02:58:57,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2104
02:58:57,927 --> 02:58:58,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz.

2105
02:58:59,167 --> 02:58:59,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ms.

2106
02:58:59,987 --> 02:59:01,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Lazzaro, for the report.

2107
02:59:01,888 --> 02:59:11,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to know, because I know part of the policy is to have the PTOs contacted so they can come and do a presentation.

2108
02:59:11,611 --> 02:59:14,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we had the first presentation was last year.

2109
02:59:15,119 --> 02:59:16,380
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was in April.

2110
02:59:16,980 --> 02:59:27,067
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was wondering if, you know, since we have the email addresses, if you could email and see if any of the PTO was interested in coming.

2111
02:59:27,107 --> 02:59:33,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was organized last year and several PTO members came out and they did a presentation.

2112
02:59:33,271 --> 02:59:34,612
[SPEAKER_09]: They took turns presenting.

2113
02:59:34,832 --> 02:59:35,652
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the intention this year.

2114
02:59:35,732 --> 02:59:36,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

2115
02:59:36,413 --> 02:59:36,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

2116
02:59:37,173 --> 02:59:39,215
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, if they can't attend, it's fine.

2117
02:59:39,255 --> 02:59:40,936
[SPEAKER_09]: They can send in a written report.

2118
02:59:41,756 --> 02:59:42,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2119
02:59:42,557 --> 02:59:43,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll let them know.

2120
02:59:43,798 --> 02:59:44,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham.

2121
02:59:46,298 --> 02:59:52,120
[SPEAKER_22]: So I know I sent a note to you before I resigned as the chair of the Brooks PTO.

2122
02:59:52,240 --> 02:59:58,201
[SPEAKER_22]: I tried to submit and I got an error message and that was after I put all the information in the form.

2123
02:59:58,782 --> 03:00:03,703
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't know if it landed to you and it just threw an error or if it just

2124
03:00:04,920 --> 03:00:05,662
[SPEAKER_22]: evaporated.

2125
03:00:05,682 --> 03:00:07,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a response from the Brooks PTA.

2126
03:00:07,625 --> 03:00:09,309
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so then maybe it was fine.

2127
03:00:09,329 --> 03:00:10,511
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wasn't sure.

2128
03:00:10,872 --> 03:00:16,763
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing I want to point out about that policy is that there were commitments made by the district about

2129
03:00:17,752 --> 03:00:23,754
[SPEAKER_22]: some training support that would be offered to these organizations, and that has not happened yet.

2130
03:00:26,315 --> 03:00:37,618
[SPEAKER_22]: There was something shared that was a webinar from the AG's office, which was actually really informative if you're going to be on a board that is a 501c3.

2131
03:00:39,699 --> 03:00:43,580
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know some schools have taken measures to make sure their folks are doing that.

2132
03:00:44,115 --> 03:00:51,978
[SPEAKER_22]: But one of the big important pieces that sort of gave rise to needing a policy at all was around treasury and record keeping.

2133
03:00:52,058 --> 03:00:56,500
[SPEAKER_22]: And there was a commitment in that policy that the district would be providing some training resource.

2134
03:00:57,576 --> 03:01:01,137
[SPEAKER_22]: for our treasurer specifically and I know that that hasn't happened yet.

2135
03:01:01,277 --> 03:01:09,680
[SPEAKER_10]: So Christine Patterson last year provided some links to trainings that are available at the Attorney General's website.

2136
03:01:09,860 --> 03:01:11,400
[SPEAKER_10]: I took those.

2137
03:01:12,281 --> 03:01:18,322
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I know about and I passed your, we had a meeting at the beginning of the summer and I passed your information along to Christine.

2138
03:01:19,603 --> 03:01:22,924
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the

2139
03:01:24,885 --> 03:01:34,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Challenge is just physical, human body, hours in a day challenge for departments that have many responsibilities.

2140
03:01:35,034 --> 03:01:48,427
[SPEAKER_10]: And since the 501c3s are separate organizations, and I understand that the policy was written to promote transparency and collaboration between all of the organizations, but I think that the

2141
03:01:49,834 --> 03:02:02,019
[SPEAKER_10]: You may run into something where there just isn't really that much time for the public school district to be instructing separate fundraising organizations on how to do business.

2142
03:02:03,059 --> 03:02:06,801
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not my office, I wouldn't do it, but that would be a suspicion that I would have.

2143
03:02:07,701 --> 03:02:11,963
[SPEAKER_10]: However, if it is the policy, we should be doing it, so that is noted.

2144
03:02:12,563 --> 03:02:15,124
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I can certainly appreciate the

2145
03:02:17,151 --> 03:02:31,680
[SPEAKER_22]: Time constraint, I think it's real and I think we have to figure out a way to maybe collaborate our way out of that But I will say As a 501 c3 the job of a treasurer is very serious.

2146
03:02:31,880 --> 03:02:32,941
[SPEAKER_22]: It has a lot of

2147
03:02:34,113 --> 03:02:43,179
[SPEAKER_22]: obligations and ramifications that sort of well-intentioned parents trying to do good for their schools just may not have the depth to understand.

2148
03:02:43,239 --> 03:02:54,826
[SPEAKER_22]: Like literally my eyebrows go up each and every time I hear about a raffle going on in our school district because I suspect that many of them are not compliant.

2149
03:02:55,086 --> 03:02:56,948
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's not because people don't want to do it.

2150
03:02:57,548 --> 03:03:00,610
[SPEAKER_22]: It's that they don't even know that there's something to do.

2151
03:03:01,456 --> 03:03:29,968
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think there are some key things that are really important from a compliance standpoint that if we could all maybe work together with the PTOs that are doing this and experiencing it and building something that's repeatable, whether that's like a Webex or something that's recorded, it would go a long way to the collaboration and a feeling that the sort of support goes both ways from the district to the PTOs and vice versa.

2152
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:44,494
[SPEAKER_15]: I had put my request on for something else but I also want to respond to member Graham point and maybe it's something that needs to be.

2153
03:03:45,048 --> 03:03:48,889
[SPEAKER_15]: moved to the rules and policies subcommittee for consideration.

2154
03:03:49,609 --> 03:03:54,211
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to put that out there now and just have people think about that.

2155
03:03:54,251 --> 03:03:56,511
[SPEAKER_15]: But the other was just a small thing.

2156
03:03:57,131 --> 03:04:02,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Emily, the citywide PTO, I think, has now renamed the elementary alliance.

2157
03:04:03,453 --> 03:04:28,328
[SPEAKER_15]: And I see that their that their email is Medford citywide PTO at gmail.com I'm not sure that that's accurate anymore, and I think there's another potentially another entity that's calling themselves the citywide PTO So it could lend itself to some confusion and so we just yeah, yeah, yeah, so Yeah, we should probably touch base about what the absolutely please if you notice anything that you think I

2158
03:04:29,258 --> 03:04:38,346
[SPEAKER_10]: If we can do it over email just then then I can I would happily add or change or adjust fluid document always thank you.

2159
03:04:38,366 --> 03:04:38,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

2160
03:04:39,107 --> 03:04:39,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2161
03:04:39,507 --> 03:04:52,838
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I guess I would ask the rest of the committee what they think of the having this as part of the rules and policy subcommittee in terms of the training for for setting up a training or a system for

2162
03:04:53,942 --> 03:04:59,587
[SPEAKER_15]: 501c3s, which I believe the McGlynn Middle PTO was the only one that was not a 501c3.

2163
03:04:59,627 --> 03:05:03,609
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe it's going to be, or is nearly, what's that?

2164
03:05:03,649 --> 03:05:04,290
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's working.

2165
03:05:04,310 --> 03:05:07,953
[SPEAKER_15]: It's almost a 501c3, so it's nearing.

2166
03:05:08,953 --> 03:05:12,356
[SPEAKER_15]: So it seems like there should be some policy in place.

2167
03:05:12,456 --> 03:05:16,939
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, I'm throwing it out to the rest of the committee to see what the feeling is.

2168
03:05:19,401 --> 03:05:19,701
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2169
03:05:20,001 --> 03:05:20,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

2170
03:05:23,359 --> 03:05:28,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first I just wanted to not forget to say that I do appreciate all the hard work that these groups are doing.

2171
03:05:28,841 --> 03:05:37,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I sounded very negative earlier and like there's like a bunch of creepy groups going off and using our names to earn money or something.

2172
03:05:37,804 --> 03:05:39,744
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not at all what I think is happening.

2173
03:05:39,865 --> 03:05:41,805
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to make sure that was on record.

2174
03:05:42,445 --> 03:05:45,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I appreciate all of the work and it's a lot of work.

2175
03:05:46,127 --> 03:05:50,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and, and you know, to the issue of training while it's,

2176
03:05:51,015 --> 03:05:59,441
[SPEAKER_07]: 100% true that, in fact, it seems almost inappropriate for us to be offering a training for non-profits.

2177
03:05:59,501 --> 03:06:05,106
[SPEAKER_07]: The reality is that when there's problems in these groups, they don't side of our organization.

2178
03:06:05,666 --> 03:06:08,748
[SPEAKER_07]: They eat up a huge amount of time for the administration.

2179
03:06:09,289 --> 03:06:17,875
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, just as a practical matter, even if we shouldn't be doing trainings, it may be a lot less work than dealing with

2180
03:06:18,594 --> 03:06:27,620
[SPEAKER_07]: the fallout when there's problems in these organizations because they're made up of parents that are obviously part of our district.

2181
03:06:28,961 --> 03:06:43,671
[SPEAKER_07]: As for a training going to that subcommittee, my memory of the last conversation around the training was that it would be on demand, meaning if somebody needs it, they could schedule a meeting with

2182
03:06:44,638 --> 03:07:03,909
[SPEAKER_07]: the assistant superintendent, who seemed to be the right person, at least at the moment, to assist them as needed, versus we were going to actually create a training, because there was really a big question, is anybody going to take us up on it in the first place?

2183
03:07:05,570 --> 03:07:14,095
[SPEAKER_07]: And without having a cadre of people who would take it, designing a training with no idea who the users are, what they're going to want to know,

2184
03:07:14,949 --> 03:07:16,510
[SPEAKER_07]: is a really big challenge.

2185
03:07:17,711 --> 03:07:24,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I personally don't feel like we have the bandwidth to design a training.

2186
03:07:24,115 --> 03:07:32,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly the subcommittee I don't think has any of the, none of the members have the skill set that I'm aware of to design any kind of financial training.

2187
03:07:34,481 --> 03:07:37,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if people are needing this,

2188
03:07:39,108 --> 03:07:52,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's best to start from the request rather than, if we had unlimited resources, then I would be like, let's go send it to our training department.

2189
03:07:52,654 --> 03:07:54,595
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that doesn't exist.

2190
03:07:55,735 --> 03:07:58,736
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just don't see how we're going to have the bandwidth for it.

2191
03:07:58,836 --> 03:08:01,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's my take.

2192
03:08:02,098 --> 03:08:02,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2193
03:08:03,779 --> 03:08:04,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Member van de Kloot.

2194
03:08:06,374 --> 03:08:28,406
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess sort of remembering the discussion last year with all good intentions that we would want to provide instruction to people, because as Member Graham says, it's an incredible responsibility and there's a lot of reporting things that you need to do when all of a sudden you're the treasurer and you need to make sure you're following all the guidelines.

2195
03:08:28,906 --> 03:08:34,849
[SPEAKER_19]: But in fact, what I see, and I think Paul has just touched on it, is that right now we notice

2196
03:08:35,473 --> 03:08:38,975
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, our people are working hard, and they're pretty tapped out.

2197
03:08:39,655 --> 03:08:48,220
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't know how we can possibly ask someone within to pursue this right now.

2198
03:08:49,561 --> 03:08:51,022
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I think that we can.

2199
03:08:51,802 --> 03:08:56,785
[SPEAKER_19]: It's worthwhile to talk to the MASC and ask them whether any of their member districts, what they do.

2200
03:08:56,885 --> 03:09:03,248
[SPEAKER_19]: We might reach out to some other school committees and see whether they give any training.

2201
03:09:03,368 --> 03:09:04,349
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, if there's something

2202
03:09:04,894 --> 03:09:15,241
[SPEAKER_19]: that already exists would be so much more preferable than having to spend any time putting something together, even if that would be a great thing.

2203
03:09:18,684 --> 03:09:19,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Superintendent.

2204
03:09:20,385 --> 03:09:33,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to echo what school committee member Van der Kloot just shared, that we are stretched very, very thin, especially in our finance department, and to take

2205
03:09:35,985 --> 03:09:46,316
[SPEAKER_08]: this on, but I am willing to reach out to MASC or speak with other school committees to see how they do address it.

2206
03:09:47,657 --> 03:09:48,578
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that it is a 501c3

2207
03:09:51,023 --> 03:10:19,853
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a freestanding entity, and so I just feel like my hands are so full with just all things education and instruction that to take this on, this is truly a whole other body of work that, yes, it's important, but I can just say that I commit to trying to find additional resources or other ways that other communities have figured it out.

2208
03:10:22,320 --> 03:10:22,840
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

2209
03:10:24,381 --> 03:10:28,343
I think my biggest concern would be people calling Ms.

2210
03:10:29,263 --> 03:10:31,965
[SPEAKER_22]: Patterson when they have problems.

2211
03:10:32,585 --> 03:10:40,188
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's the worst case scenario, actually, because she's going to end up repeating herself again and again as people ask questions.

2212
03:10:40,208 --> 03:10:44,610
[SPEAKER_22]: So we can remove it from the policy.

2213
03:10:44,630 --> 03:10:48,732
[SPEAKER_22]: That's an option that we should maybe talk about in the Rules Subcommittee.

2214
03:10:51,405 --> 03:11:04,416
[SPEAKER_22]: But I just want this body to know that despite the best of intentions of all of these really hardworking volunteers, they're probably not getting it right because it's very complicated.

2215
03:11:05,217 --> 03:11:14,565
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't want that to come back and sort of cause stress on this body or this administration, but more importantly,

2216
03:11:15,257 --> 03:11:23,440
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't want it to come back on these well-meaning volunteers, which could also happen as they sit on a board of a 501c3.

2217
03:11:23,560 --> 03:11:40,806
[SPEAKER_22]: So I know it's sort of not our problem to solve, but from a collaboration standpoint, I have some real concerns about choosing not to do anything, because I feel like we need to take that into consideration.

2218
03:11:42,207 --> 03:11:42,827
[SPEAKER_22]: Member Ruseau.

2219
03:11:44,280 --> 03:11:45,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, nothing.

2220
03:11:45,700 --> 03:11:45,960
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

2221
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:47,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Van der Kloot.

2222
03:11:47,321 --> 03:12:01,383
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll reach out to the MASC and at least ask the question there of whether they know of any training, whether that's a voice where we can get a message out saying, hey, does your school system do something?

2223
03:12:01,783 --> 03:12:09,404
[SPEAKER_19]: So that at least we can start sort of saying, is there anything around that we could adopt?

2224
03:12:10,264 --> 03:12:11,665
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll do that first piece.

2225
03:12:12,025 --> 03:12:12,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2226
03:12:12,865 --> 03:12:13,525
[SPEAKER_19]: Member McLaughlin.

2227
03:12:15,938 --> 03:12:17,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for offering to do that.

2228
03:12:18,100 --> 03:12:42,141
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that this is an ongoing conversation and while in some respects you know 501c3s are separate entities when they are using the school's name and the school's building and what have you there is an interconnectedness between them so I don't know I'm not an attorney obviously and you are but not in this particular field I know but you know the question about legal liability is definitely something that I think

2229
03:12:42,551 --> 03:12:47,755
[SPEAKER_15]: does need to be considered as we're talking about policy and school rules.

2230
03:12:49,015 --> 03:12:53,939
[SPEAKER_15]: And because there are so many strict requirements, I did also do the AG training.

2231
03:12:54,159 --> 03:12:57,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's a lot to be taken in there.

2232
03:12:57,121 --> 03:13:00,603
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think asking MASC is a great step.

2233
03:13:00,744 --> 03:13:01,784
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Paulette, for doing that.

2234
03:13:01,804 --> 03:13:06,007
[SPEAKER_15]: I think also looking at other school districts and understanding and seeing what they do.

2235
03:13:06,047 --> 03:13:07,048
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that there's some

2236
03:13:07,475 --> 03:13:23,029
[SPEAKER_15]: gray area here and I don't think it's as easy as just saying, you know, it's not really part of our responsibility and not that anyone here is saying that, I'm just saying that there could be repercussions that we aren't aware of and that we should consider.

2237
03:13:23,049 --> 03:13:23,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2238
03:13:24,571 --> 03:13:24,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2239
03:13:29,555 --> 03:13:33,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to accept the report on fundraising organizations.

2240
03:13:36,155 --> 03:13:39,416
[SPEAKER_16]: except by Mr. Rousseau, seconded by Ms.

2241
03:13:39,496 --> 03:13:39,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Kreatz.

2242
03:13:40,377 --> 03:13:41,157
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2243
03:13:41,497 --> 03:13:42,297
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2244
03:13:42,478 --> 03:13:42,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2245
03:13:43,298 --> 03:13:43,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Old business.

2246
03:13:44,058 --> 03:13:45,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have any old business?

2247
03:13:46,939 --> 03:13:48,520
[SPEAKER_16]: Or would we like to table old business?

2248
03:13:49,860 --> 03:13:55,583
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table by Ms.

2249
03:13:55,623 --> 03:13:56,503
[SPEAKER_16]: McLaughlin.

2250
03:13:57,303 --> 03:13:58,464
[SPEAKER_16]: That's in the beginning.

2251
03:13:59,324 --> 03:14:00,044
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2252
03:14:00,064 --> 03:14:00,885
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2253
03:14:01,025 --> 03:14:01,945
[SPEAKER_16]: Communications?

2254
03:14:02,705 --> 03:14:03,626
[SPEAKER_16]: New business?

2255
03:14:04,752 --> 03:14:08,494
[SPEAKER_16]: School Safety Procedure Update, motion to table.

2256
03:14:10,455 --> 03:14:17,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Kreatz.

2257
03:14:18,580 --> 03:14:22,122
[SPEAKER_16]: School Safety Procedural Update is tabled till March 9th.

2258
03:14:23,023 --> 03:14:24,643
[SPEAKER_16]: Status of the standing reports.

2259
03:14:27,705 --> 03:14:32,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to table by Member Ruseau, seconded by

2260
03:14:33,891 --> 03:14:37,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Kreatz, and we have a school committee resolution.

2261
03:14:37,653 --> 03:14:42,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Jonathan Davis.

2262
03:14:43,397 --> 03:14:51,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Davis was the brother-in-law of former mayor Michael J. McGlynn and retired teacher Karen McGlynn Devine.

2263
03:14:51,722 --> 03:14:53,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Please all rise for a moment of silence.

2264
03:15:08,341 --> 03:15:10,623
[SPEAKER_16]: And motion to revert back to the regular business.

2265
03:15:11,423 --> 03:15:20,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Curriculum Subcommittee, Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, ECRI, and Planning for Future Meetings 2.5.20, Member Van der Kloot.

2266
03:15:20,790 --> 03:15:25,973
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, so I'm going to make this the short version because of the long hour.

2267
03:15:26,594 --> 03:15:32,558
[SPEAKER_19]: But you've heard ECRI being referred to any number of times this evening.

2268
03:15:43,071 --> 03:16:04,966
[SPEAKER_19]: Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell welcomed everybody and she explained that there would be, on March 3rd, a half day of professional development session conducted by Hill for literacy and professional development would continue next year.

2269
03:16:05,665 --> 03:16:17,571
[SPEAKER_19]: ECRI materials consist of downloadable PDFs for classroom instruction and full district implementation is expected to occur at the beginning of next fall.

2270
03:16:17,651 --> 03:16:19,052
[SPEAKER_19]: We received two handouts.

2271
03:16:20,373 --> 03:16:34,120
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Chiesa spoke about ECRI as a multi-tiered program, Tier 1 and Tier 2, featuring a series of teaching routines designed to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of reading instruction in K-2.

2272
03:16:35,119 --> 03:16:43,224
[SPEAKER_19]: The program is being introduced to improve student achievement in word reading and comprehension, fluency, and phonological awareness.

2273
03:16:44,144 --> 03:16:46,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Tier one of the program is whole group instruction.

2274
03:16:46,505 --> 03:16:48,226
[SPEAKER_19]: Tier two is targeted intervention.

2275
03:16:49,427 --> 03:16:58,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Our teacher, Kristen Howell, title one at the Columbus, worked with ECRIB this past summer through a grant in conjunction with DESE and spoke highly of the program.

2276
03:16:58,792 --> 03:17:03,355
[SPEAKER_19]: Also at our meeting, Michelle Donahue, a Medford resident and a teacher in another district,

2277
03:17:03,940 --> 03:17:06,441
[SPEAKER_19]: spoke to her very positive experience with ECRI.

2278
03:17:06,842 --> 03:17:14,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Her district uses a different reading program than Medford's journeys, but they have the same concerns about foundational weaknesses that we are seeing.

2279
03:17:15,006 --> 03:17:15,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

2280
03:17:15,186 --> 03:17:19,989
[SPEAKER_19]: Donaghy brought her teaching materials and explained facets of the day-to-day implementation.

2281
03:17:20,409 --> 03:17:25,752
[SPEAKER_19]: She sees it as something that easily fit into her current teaching and bolstered her students' understanding.

2282
03:17:26,512 --> 03:17:29,734
[SPEAKER_19]: Member Graham asked when the Journeys Program would be evaluated.

2283
03:17:30,154 --> 03:17:37,599
[SPEAKER_19]: A discussion about the complexity of implementing all the new curriculum pieces followed, and we covered that some in our budget meeting tonight.

2284
03:17:38,440 --> 03:17:44,303
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Keyes explained that it was essential not to overwhelm teachers while other new curriculums were being adopted.

2285
03:17:46,044 --> 03:17:54,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Member van der Kloot asked Director Teixeira whether ECRI program would be useful for EL, and he explained he responded in the affirmative.

2286
03:17:55,250 --> 03:18:00,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Parent Sharon Hayes expressed some concerns with Journey's approach to the teaching of combination letter sounds.

2287
03:18:01,534 --> 03:18:04,016
[SPEAKER_19]: Diane Caldwell noted that the cost of ECRI is $275 per level.

2288
03:18:05,961 --> 03:18:11,422
[SPEAKER_19]: The combined cost came to $3,300, and the cost would be covered by Title I funds.

2289
03:18:12,583 --> 03:18:18,704
[SPEAKER_19]: The motion was accepted, was made to accept ECRI, was made by myself and seconded by Ms.

2290
03:18:18,724 --> 03:18:20,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Stone, and the motion passed three to one.

2291
03:18:21,485 --> 03:18:30,087
[SPEAKER_19]: The chair asked about upcoming topics, and we have a list, elementary, ELA, and math, suggestion to create the overall map of the curriculum.

2292
03:18:30,892 --> 03:18:42,537
[SPEAKER_19]: We reviewed, we suggested we talk about civic standards in fourth and eighth grade, the amount of assessments, possibly reviewing elementary Italian program, and win assessments.

2293
03:18:42,737 --> 03:18:45,618
[SPEAKER_19]: And we adjourned at 6.59 p.m.

2294
03:18:46,978 --> 03:18:53,781
[SPEAKER_19]: I would like to add to this and announce that we have another curriculum subcommittee meeting this Wednesday at 4.30, between 4.30 and 5.30.

2295
03:18:57,038 --> 03:19:01,261
[SPEAKER_19]: The purpose is to discuss proposed changes to the middle school health curriculum.

2296
03:19:01,701 --> 03:19:04,162
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll be meeting this week again, okay?

2297
03:19:05,083 --> 03:19:06,904
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I think- Where's the meeting, Ms.

2298
03:19:06,964 --> 03:19:07,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Van der Kloot?

2299
03:19:07,765 --> 03:19:09,085
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be up at Medford High School.

2300
03:19:09,105 --> 03:19:09,646
[SPEAKER_19]: Medford High School.

2301
03:19:10,226 --> 03:19:20,312
[SPEAKER_19]: It would be appropriate for the school committee to endorse the adoption of ECRI.

2302
03:19:20,713 --> 03:19:26,196
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to make a motion that the school committee endorse the proposed adoption of ECRI.

2303
03:19:28,548 --> 03:19:29,209
[SPEAKER_19]: Member McLaughlin.

2304
03:19:30,750 --> 03:19:49,229
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the subcommittee curriculum report and I wanted to add that again getting to what was discussed earlier about level 3 students that were considering curriculum across the board for our access and learning

2305
03:19:50,943 --> 03:19:54,704
[SPEAKER_15]: language-based classrooms and that those questions are part.

2306
03:19:54,724 --> 03:20:10,848
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that currently the curriculum subcommittee I don't believe has a member or I don't know if there is community involvement for individuals that are tier three, but if there aren't, if there could be some

2307
03:20:11,928 --> 03:20:14,909
[SPEAKER_15]: solicited for meetings related to that, that would be very helpful.

2308
03:20:14,949 --> 03:20:15,910
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just add that.

2309
03:20:15,990 --> 03:20:25,854
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I wanted to agree that a curriculum map would be very useful, especially as we're considering all three of those tiers.

2310
03:20:26,614 --> 03:20:26,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2311
03:20:27,855 --> 03:20:28,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau?

2312
03:20:29,896 --> 03:20:31,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you for the report.

2313
03:20:31,396 --> 03:20:33,537
[SPEAKER_07]: It says the motion passed 3 to 1.

2314
03:20:33,597 --> 03:20:34,738
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't have four members.

2315
03:20:34,798 --> 03:20:35,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it 3 to 0?

2316
03:20:36,168 --> 03:20:37,369
[SPEAKER_16]: 3-0.

2317
03:20:37,489 --> 03:20:38,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

2318
03:20:38,470 --> 03:20:43,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that's an important correction just because it would be an open meeting.

2319
03:20:43,854 --> 03:20:53,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Ruseau.

2320
03:20:53,923 --> 03:20:54,644
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

2321
03:20:54,664 --> 03:20:55,264
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2322
03:20:55,504 --> 03:20:56,205
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2323
03:20:57,272 --> 03:20:58,472
[SPEAKER_16]: Committee report is adopted.

2324
03:20:59,392 --> 03:21:01,153
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a report of superintendent.

2325
03:21:01,233 --> 03:21:03,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you like to table that?

2326
03:21:04,013 --> 03:21:05,414
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to talk for 20 minutes right now?

2327
03:21:05,734 --> 03:21:06,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2328
03:21:07,134 --> 03:21:11,915
