[SPEAKER_03]: We have a quorum.

39
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:48,225
[SPEAKER_03]: We can proceed.

40
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:51,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn it over to the administration, whoever's going to start us off.

41
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:56,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, everyone.

42
00:02:56,172 --> 00:03:04,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, we're going to start off our day two for budget, and we have another set of presentations today.

43
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:10,898
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be hearing from our assistant superintendents on specific initiatives, Ms.

44
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:12,398
[SPEAKER_10]: Galussi and Dr. Cushing.

45
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:19,000
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll also be hearing from our vocational school and some of our other administrators.

46
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,822
[SPEAKER_10]: And so without much further ado, I'm going to pass it on to Mr. Murphy.

47
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

48
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:28,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone can hear me okay?

49
00:03:29,031 --> 00:03:29,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

50
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:40,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So as the superintendent said, tonight, we will be diving back into our developing FY23 budget.

51
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:49,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go through the sort of background of sort of school budgeting 101 pieces a little more quickly tonight.

52
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:54,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, as I said last night, and you've heard me say throughout each of your budget updates that

53
00:03:55,887 --> 00:04:00,009
[SPEAKER_05]: that those contextual pieces are important, particularly for community members.

54
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:24,958
[SPEAKER_05]: As has been pointed out on several occasions, this process is an opportunity for the members of the greater Medford community to have an opportunity to see how it is that the district is investing taxpayer dollars and what strategic priorities we are pursuing on behalf of the students of the Medford public schools.

55
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:48,481
[SPEAKER_05]: The structure that the school committee adopted this year with regard to the budget process is meant to be more efficient, but part of that is also getting us to a place in which we can have a thoughtful discussion and expand upon the rationale and thought process behind many of the priorities that are before you.

56
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:53,424
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get to a few of the slides from last night,

57
00:04:54,183 --> 00:05:02,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there'll be a few pieces, uh, that Dr. Edward just alluded to one of them that, um, we sort of moved past, uh, quickly last night.

58
00:05:02,565 --> 00:05:04,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but we'll have the opportunity to hear a little bit more about.

59
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:14,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, this evening, and then we have some operational, uh, issues that we'll discuss just in terms of sequence, in terms of where this is leading.

60
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:19,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we'll have a comprehensive budget update at your, uh, may 16th meeting.

61
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and as we'll talk about when we get to the timeline,

62
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:26,975
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're driving toward is a budgetary request to the municipal government.

63
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:46,145
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be followed by deliberations on the municipal side, presentation presumably of the school administration at that time before the municipal council, which is an annual event that gives us the opportunity to discuss with that body the priorities that have made it into the superintendents request.

64
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:50,667
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor will make a recommendation to the municipal council and then

65
00:05:51,308 --> 00:06:02,376
[SPEAKER_05]: subsequent to the council's appropriation of that financial, those funds for FY23, the school committee will be asked to take a vote to adopt that budget.

66
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:20,769
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll remember last year that just based on the calendar and how that process played out, the school committee, once we knew the mayor's recommendation to the council, took a vote that preceded the council's appropriation that was contingent upon that number coming back

67
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:23,655
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's what leads to the administration's implementation.

68
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:31,899
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the quick overview for community members who might be joining us this evening and who haven't been along for the ride throughout the various budget updates.

69
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:39,043
[SPEAKER_05]: We encourage you to watch the May 9th meeting in which there was a more extended version of that explanation.

70
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:45,386
[SPEAKER_05]: And if mayor, you and members of the committee are ready to proceed, I asked Dr. Cushing to put up the deck.

71
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:50,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the first half of this is very similar to what we saw last night.

72
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:55,789
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our budget process, that's our timeline, makes note of the various governmental components that we're contingent upon.

73
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:11,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Our budget is made up of external funds that come from the federal government and our Chapter 70 allocation that comes from the state government, that's taxpayer dollars from all cities and towns across the Commonwealth that in Medford makes up about 20% of our operating budget.

74
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:18,417
[SPEAKER_05]: We are largely a local contribution community, meaning it is the taxes of the people of the city of Medford

75
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:21,983
[SPEAKER_05]: that pay for approximately 80% of our budget.

76
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:41,836
[SPEAKER_05]: A really important point, a slide that we can't just pass by quickly, even though I know you've now seen it on three occasions in the last nine days, but when you have a 67 to $70 million operating budget and 54 to $55 million are spent on personnel,

77
00:07:47,782 --> 00:07:57,808
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have nine open collective bargaining agreements, we know that that is a major driver of our budget process.

78
00:07:57,989 --> 00:08:14,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And so given that variable that we are negotiating or will soon be negotiating contracts with nine of 10 bargaining units representing the majority of our employees, we know that that's something that we're gonna have to take into account as we move toward the FY23 budget.

79
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:22,342
[SPEAKER_05]: It is true for all school systems, organizations that are made up entirely of people, focused on people.

80
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:24,262
[SPEAKER_05]: People are where the money goes.

81
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:42,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you see there our third bullet point that you've heard me speak to in the past, which is that while we as an organization don't articulate with specificity our proposals while we're at the bargaining table as a general rule,

82
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:59,583
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very clear and we have been throughout previous budget processes and very clear throughout this fiscal year that we understand that there's a critical importance with respect to maintaining competitiveness with regard to our wage increases.

83
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:05,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is just as important that we adhere to our responsibility to maintain sustainability.

84
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:09,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the two prongs of everything we do at the bargaining table.

85
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:19,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has a significant connection to what we're doing here in terms of planning out our operating budget for FY23.

86
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:35,522
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that frankly, it does have an impact and it influences everything else that we'll speak about tonight that we'll be articulating as we did last night, the budgetary priorities and the ones that we feel have risen to a level of urgency with which we need to pursue and make strategic decisions as to

87
00:09:36,278 --> 00:09:41,481
[SPEAKER_05]: whether to utilize recurring or one-time funding sources.

88
00:09:42,662 --> 00:09:59,711
[SPEAKER_05]: But with respect to understanding that one of the biggest variables is still to be determined as we continue to negotiate in good faith with our bargaining partners, that is the sort of context in which the FY23 budget is developing.

89
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:04,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So we said that

90
00:10:05,712 --> 00:10:11,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Competitiveness and sustainability is a critical priority for us with regard to our collective bargaining.

91
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:18,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Before you now are the priorities that are informing the development of our FY23 budget.

92
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:28,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Each of these has a nexus in one way or another to the goals stated in the strategic plan that the school committee adopted upon the superintendent's recommendation earlier this year.

93
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:33,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So as each of the priorities that we articulated last night and the ones that we'll talk about tonight,

94
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:39,317
[SPEAKER_05]: will connect in one way or another to those goals.

95
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:55,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, again, you've heard us speak about them, and hopefully you're able to sort of see now the sort of concrete connections and how the aspirational statements of the strategic plan are translating into concrete budgetary objectives going into the new fiscal year.

96
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,369
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the remaining priorities.

97
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, these are the big picture groupings.

98
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:06,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So with every budget, we start with our fixed costs.

99
00:11:07,027 --> 00:11:29,547
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the things that based on decisions that have been made previously, contracts that have been adopted, curriculum that we've invested in, and then always some special education costs that we don't, we will see some relief from based on some of the external funding, but not until later during the fiscal year, we have a responsibility to report on what is the estimated fixed costs.

100
00:11:30,768 --> 00:11:32,109
[SPEAKER_05]: In tonight's budget presentation,

101
00:11:32,783 --> 00:11:47,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Primarily, we're going to focus on some of the larger organizational goals in our structure, as well as some pieces of technology, although we ended up sort of diving into the technology last night, which hopefully will allow for a more efficient use of time this evening.

102
00:11:49,347 --> 00:12:01,070
[SPEAKER_05]: This set of data essentially reports out on how the budget is going to move, irrespective of any strategic decisions that the school committee makes, and regardless of what happens at the bargaining table.

103
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:08,684
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the funding that, in one way or another, we've essentially already committed to, the organization has committed to.

104
00:12:08,704 --> 00:12:19,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see that the biggest number there, with regard to the contractual salary increases, those are largely steps and lanes that are owed under existing CBAs.

105
00:12:22,568 --> 00:12:27,189
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these are estimations, and pretty much every number that you'll see here is an estimation.

106
00:12:28,493 --> 00:12:34,596
[SPEAKER_05]: As was the case last year, as we continue to scrub these numbers, there could be some fluctuation.

107
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:42,299
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see the $155,000 estimate there for the subscriptions and contract service renewals.

108
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:53,705
[SPEAKER_05]: We did an analysis today that indicated that based on some of the ongoing negotiations with some of those vendors, it is possible that that could come in a little under 155, which would be good.

109
00:12:53,765 --> 00:12:56,606
[SPEAKER_05]: It could nudge that fixed cost increase down.

110
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but that's, that's still uncertain.

111
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:09,042
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, um, And frankly, even with that analysis, it did not appear as though it was going to be of a magnitude that sort of justified going back at this moment and changing that.

112
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:24,373
[SPEAKER_05]: But prior to the school committee, taking a vote on a precise number, um, all of that will be tied to various line items and you'll have a, you'll have a more, um, more precise sense, but you can, at the moment it would appear as though it will still be in the vicinity of 150, but that line will be.

113
00:13:24,826 --> 00:13:46,078
[SPEAKER_05]: the vicinity of $155,000, but a little later tonight, I'll sort of expand upon that and give you a sense on a very broad level and a high level, just how much of the district's financial commitments through various programs, platforms, applications, and use of various infrastructure are tied to that number of $155,000 being the increase of FY22 over FY23.

114
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:05,174
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll move forward to a slide that we talked a little bit about last night.

115
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:10,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing, if you want to just move up there, thank you very much.

116
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:19,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, this spells out some of the numbers that we count on each year to get a sense as to, or at least in recent years, we do.

117
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:29,142
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the case that we've been looking at ESSER funding for too long, but it's been such a lifeline coming out of the pandemic that

118
00:14:29,632 --> 00:14:37,558
[SPEAKER_05]: managing our ESSER budget has sort of in some ways become as sort of second nature in many ways as our Chapter 70, our local contribution.

119
00:14:37,658 --> 00:14:49,228
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the screen now represents, as we discussed last night, the minimum amount of funding that under state law, the Medford community is obligated to commit to the public school system.

120
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:50,809
[SPEAKER_05]: That's $64.9 million.

121
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:55,272
[SPEAKER_05]: That represents a $3.8 million increase based on the minimum from FY22.

122
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:58,179
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a significant increase.

123
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:10,446
[SPEAKER_05]: However, as we've said, that increase still brings us below what our current operating budget is, which is a testament to the commitment to education of the people of Medford.

124
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:18,270
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also indicates, frankly, that the minimum that the state has established for us is not really in keeping with reality, frankly.

125
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, to sort of weaken the table for the time being,

126
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:31,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, uh, are any agreements or disagreements we might have with the state's funding formula, uh, and the implications of some of the, some of the provisions of those laws.

127
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:38,935
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, the sort of short version of this as well, we're seeing a significant increase in the minimum requirement.

128
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:44,917
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit of a moot point based on the existing commitment that the community has made.

129
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:51,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then the number in the table in the bottom, right, that's $69.9 million.

130
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:59,847
[SPEAKER_05]: That represents our estimated projected FY23 budget, including only fixed costs.

131
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:07,651
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we only included the $2.5 million in contractual obligations that currently exist, that's where that would be.

132
00:16:07,771 --> 00:16:08,751
[SPEAKER_02]: We can go to the next slide.

133
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:20,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're getting now into some, there are new slides just for anyone who's wondering if we're just doing the same presentation for last night.

134
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:21,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I promise you we're not.

135
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:29,250
[SPEAKER_05]: just sort of establishing that baseline information and context we thought would be important coming into tonight's presentation.

136
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:37,993
[SPEAKER_05]: But as you move left to right on this table, you can see that 69.9 includes the fixed cost increase that we're currently estimating.

137
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:52,118
[SPEAKER_05]: The $71 million number at the center of this table represents the number, if we were to incorporate into the FY23 budget, a 2% cost of living increase for all bargaining unit employees.

138
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:03,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That is an extension of the point I made earlier tonight that we recognize our responsibility to maintain competitiveness with respect to wages.

139
00:17:04,145 --> 00:17:19,592
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a responsibility to maintain sustainability so that we're not establishing financial structural deficits that will in turn result in us not having the services available to students that they need in the future.

140
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that is something that

141
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:22,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an obligation that we have.

142
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:29,113
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a dual responsibility and one that we take with us both through the budget process and in the course of collective bargaining.

143
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:46,637
[SPEAKER_05]: On the far right, and again, you see the highlights there just to expand upon a few points from last night, the sort of strategic conundrum that school districts find themselves in in this budget season has to do with wanting to avoid the development of those types of

144
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:59,638
[SPEAKER_05]: structural deficits, we don't want to commit a significant amount of one-time funding to personnel needs that we know are going to last beyond the time and the nature of that funding.

145
00:17:59,718 --> 00:18:13,041
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, as was the case last year, we recognize that it is personnel that our students require to bridge the gaps that have been caused or exacerbated by the pandemic.

146
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:15,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And so while as a general rule,

147
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:30,076
[SPEAKER_05]: we have and we would continue to want to avoid committing one-time funding to personnel needs, there are places in which that is unavoidable and it's advantageous for the students of the Medford Public Schools for us to do just that.

148
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:34,439
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was part of our recommendations last year and it will be part of our recommendations this year.

149
00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:44,025
[SPEAKER_05]: The other point I would just add in terms of that distinction, that there are instances in which both on the city side with the ARPA funding

150
00:18:44,492 --> 00:18:56,240
[SPEAKER_05]: and on the school side with the ESSER funding, that it's not just a question of the sort of strategic problems that come with committing one-time funding to personnel costs.

151
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:04,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Each of those grants, each of those federal funding sources have eligibility criteria.

152
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:16,049
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it is not the case that we can just commit some that neither the school district nor the city can commit portions of that funding to certain personnel objectives, even if we would want to.

153
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:27,255
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to pause for a second because we're about to get into some of the pieces of the conversation that are sort of a jumping off point from where we'll be talking tonight.

154
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:32,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the next slide is not one that you've seen as part of the budget process, but one that you'll be familiar with from

155
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,451
[SPEAKER_05]: previous presentations to the school committee.

156
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,612
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our organizational chart.

157
00:19:38,092 --> 00:19:39,552
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a complicated organization.

158
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:49,476
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a complicated organizational chart, but this essentially spells out the various areas of responsibility and portfolios that various administrators are responsible for.

159
00:19:50,016 --> 00:20:01,560
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as a general rule, this organizational chart, you should be able to see in this which office is responsible for advancing various components of the strategic plan.

160
00:20:02,043 --> 00:20:13,556
[SPEAKER_05]: in which areas, as well as offices that are responsible for the management and oversight of some of the budgetary lines that we'll discuss tonight, as well as next week.

161
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:17,160
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is how we are currently organized.

162
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:35,440
[SPEAKER_05]: There are shifts from time to time as the superintendent sees fit, but as a general rule, this is how we're organized to do the work of the strategic plan and to act as fiscal, responsible fiscal stewards of the people of Medford's dollars.

163
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:39,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as we move forward, we'll be talking a little bit more about that.

164
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:45,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, so last night we talked about our categorization of A through F.

165
00:20:46,616 --> 00:21:01,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like some of these priorities will shift as we continue to vet internally, take feedback from the school committee, some of the labeling of certain categories could shift and likely will prior to the superintendent's recommendation to the committee.

166
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,221
[SPEAKER_05]: You will not see changes in the categorization of priorities this evening.

167
00:21:07,261 --> 00:21:14,463
[SPEAKER_05]: There are one or two that just in the course of our conversation last night, one I think I even referenced in the midst of the presentation,

168
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:18,199
[SPEAKER_05]: There are likely to be a few shifts with respect to that.

169
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:33,750
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we go to the next slide, you'll be able to see, and for anyone joining us tonight for the first time, each of the budgetary priorities that the school committee is being asked to consider is essentially labeled as one of these six categories.

170
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:43,597
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is not the case that it is a strict hierarchy of we'll do everything in box A, and then if we can, then we'll do everything in box B. And if we can do both of those boxes, we'll do box C.

171
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:51,814
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what this represents, nor does the list of potential priorities and objectives that you'll see in the succeeding slides.

172
00:21:52,374 --> 00:22:01,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that indicate that that is somehow some type of extremely long wishlist that the district will be pursuing?

173
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:10,923
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an organization of, based on the data that we have and the feedback we've received from staff of budgetary priorities that deserves some

174
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:14,024
[SPEAKER_05]: can generally speak in some consideration.

175
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:35,741
[SPEAKER_05]: There really isn't, if there are priorities that would occur to everyone from the superintendent to the various administrators that we've discussed that as we discuss it as a leadership team might not necessarily make the cut basically for lack of a better term before we get to the school, before it gets to the school committee consideration.

176
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,683
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's nothing on this list that we think is necessarily

177
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:43,547
[SPEAKER_05]: not in a certain context, something that we'd want to pursue.

178
00:22:43,627 --> 00:22:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: But context is important.

179
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:54,234
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of the contextual pieces that we have to think about is the fact that, one, we have a limited budgetary capacity, as all public organizations do.

180
00:22:54,694 --> 00:22:59,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, the city has a limited budgetary capacity, as all public institutions do.

181
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:07,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have this unique situation in which we have this significant amount of grant funding that's available to us that is time limited.

182
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And therefore, we want to be mindful about structural deficits.

183
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:30,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, if we have $6.2 million available to us over the next three fiscal years, which we do through the ESSER funding, we want to put that toward investments that are going to support students and their needs right now so that we can position them for success throughout the remainder of their academic careers.

184
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:36,337
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that you heard the administration speak about a great deal in the last budgetary

185
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:55,313
[SPEAKER_05]: cycle, and it is just as true now, and in some ways perhaps maybe more pronounced, is that we do not want the students who went to the Medford Public Schools during the COVID-19 pandemic to have their academic careers defined by the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

186
00:23:55,733 --> 00:24:05,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And so essentially all of the budgetary priorities that you are seeing are informed through that lens of understanding that there are learners

187
00:24:06,066 --> 00:24:10,810
[SPEAKER_05]: who have had these learning gaps that have been caused or exacerbated by the pandemic.

188
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:18,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of that, and again, you heard me talk about the eligibility criteria for the ESSER funding.

189
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:34,547
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the sort of short way to summarize the multi-page definition that has been promulgated by the federal government and DESE with respect to eligibility and expenses is to the sufficiency of the nexus between

190
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:41,033
[SPEAKER_05]: the what you're trying to fund and the correlation with the disruption caused by the pandemic.

191
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:53,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's something that we would have done and would have done before and would have done after and would have done regardless if any of us had ever heard of COVID-19, it's more likely to be an operating budget priority.

192
00:24:53,719 --> 00:25:03,403
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is something that its necessity has been increased as a result of the pandemic, and particularly

193
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:19,276
[SPEAKER_05]: if there's some correlation between the priority and the timeline associated with the pandemic in the succeeding years, then it is something that would be more likely to be considered on the ESSER budget.

194
00:25:19,336 --> 00:25:25,680
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are other things that you'll see, and we talked about last night, that we're saying we have to do this one way or another.

195
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we don't, if we can't do it on the operating budget, then we would need to resort to the ESSER funding.

196
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:43,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we will probably tinker with the categorization between now and next week, but as a general rule, that's sort of how we're analyzing the various funding priorities.

197
00:25:44,294 --> 00:26:01,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so as we go through the next few slides, assuming everyone is still awake because I recognize for some reason my voice is more monotone than usual this evening, we're going to be expanding upon a few points

198
00:26:02,567 --> 00:26:07,708
[SPEAKER_05]: that for various reasons, we didn't necessarily spend a lot of time on last evening.

199
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:19,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, our primary goal tonight is talking a little bit about how these priorities relate to our structure as an organization and our strategic priorities under the strategic plan.

200
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:31,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be talking a little bit about the priorities that are highlighted and they could, again, as you can see, some of the things that we didn't spend as much or any time talking about last night, we wanna make sure they're given

201
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,222
[SPEAKER_05]: given their due, whatever that may be.

202
00:26:35,742 --> 00:26:36,583
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Ms.

203
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:52,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Colusa will be talking a little bit about both the professional learning opportunities at the elementary level, as well as one of the bullet points, I guess that's a little further on in the presentation, is about the ongoing responsibility to be trying to identify potential efficiencies and savings.

204
00:26:53,233 --> 00:27:01,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And we look for those before, during, and after the budget process.

205
00:27:01,783 --> 00:27:10,426
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are times when we think we have a potential savings that we're going to realize, but we don't know.

206
00:27:11,127 --> 00:27:12,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes we don't know till later in the year.

207
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:28,393
[SPEAKER_05]: If there was a way that we could sort of establish in a very rigid way, this is exactly what every line item is gonna be, that would frankly make it a lot easier to administer the organization, but that's not really how it works.

208
00:27:28,993 --> 00:27:36,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so what we're doing is trying to project where there could be some flexibility, um, and then, and make decisions accordingly.

209
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:43,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I know we've spoken about the math coaches previously with regard to the investigations three.

210
00:27:44,322 --> 00:27:56,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as you can see, that's listed as a first priority in part, as we talked about last week, excuse me, last night, I guess, and last week, maybe, um, that we're making the commitment to the new elementary school math curriculum.

211
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:04,253
[SPEAKER_05]: This is categorized as category A for the reason that I mentioned earlier, that it's something that we would be prepared to do irrespective of the pandemic.

212
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:18,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's one of very few personnel priorities that we intend to, that really we believe should be in the operating budget and not run the risk of the one-time funding piece.

213
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:24,525
[SPEAKER_05]: We've highlighted it here because in case there were any other questions about that or sort of the strategic thought behind

214
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:28,333
[SPEAKER_05]: wanting to make sure that we have the personnel to match that investment.

215
00:28:29,893 --> 00:28:36,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I offered this last night and then we started moving through the priorities and just, I didn't know that it got as much time as it otherwise would have.

216
00:28:36,794 --> 00:28:41,855
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to stop here for a second to see if anyone has any questions for Ms.

217
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:46,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Kalusi or anyone else as to the rationale or reasoning behind this.

218
00:28:51,017 --> 00:28:54,498
[SPEAKER_05]: And if no one does, I can't see,

219
00:28:55,691 --> 00:29:00,152
[SPEAKER_05]: Squares Mayor, I don't know if you're able to, but if we want to just keep moving, I'm happy to do that as well.

220
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:07,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone would like me to keep moving?

221
00:29:08,734 --> 00:29:08,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

222
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:09,514
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

223
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:10,694
[SPEAKER_05]: On we go then.

224
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:16,855
[SPEAKER_05]: So I highlighted the registrar because it was one of the few personnel items that we didn't have the opportunity to spend time on.

225
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:24,277
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a position that has in one form or another has existed previously in the Medford Public Schools.

226
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,394
[SPEAKER_05]: it would exist in most districts of our size.

227
00:29:28,575 --> 00:29:36,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is something that we think would add significant value in terms of the capacity would potentially open up with respect to other administrators.

228
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:49,523
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also something that's been categorized, we think appropriately as a category D, because it's not one that is going to be able to, as most of the personnel priorities,

229
00:29:52,013 --> 00:30:09,298
[SPEAKER_05]: As most of, Dr. Cushing, if you just want to text that, I think we might have a technical issue that we need to address with one of the committee members, but it is prioritizing category D in part because it's not a student facing position.

230
00:30:09,818 --> 00:30:21,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And so while we think in terms of making sure that we're maximizing use of all staff and administrators time, it is something that is absolutely worthy of consideration and could position us to more

231
00:30:22,443 --> 00:30:25,385
[SPEAKER_05]: have a higher functioning secondary system in particular.

232
00:30:26,185 --> 00:30:43,553
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also frankly an example of something that may not make a final recommendation or a final adoption based on the fact that the priority has to be student facing positions that will position students to not have their academic careers defined by the pandemic.

233
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:48,576
[SPEAKER_05]: So there frankly isn't a whole lot to discuss with that at the moment.

234
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:51,557
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just one that we didn't spend any time on.

235
00:30:52,208 --> 00:31:07,995
[SPEAKER_05]: and also didn't wanna leave there to be any confusion that the district would be prioritizing the registrar over and above some of the other positions that have that distinction of being a more student-facing position.

236
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:13,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So any questions on registrar or any other points that anyone would like to make?

237
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:17,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Mayor?

238
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Graham?

239
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:36,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, on the registrar, if I am recalling correctly, this is a position that was eliminated when we made a serious cut to the budget for school year 2021 and has not yet been restored.

240
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:37,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

241
00:31:38,368 --> 00:31:39,868
[SPEAKER_05]: That timeline sounds right to me.

242
00:31:39,888 --> 00:31:41,509
[SPEAKER_05]: It did precede my time.

243
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:45,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if the incumbent was in the position at the time it was eliminated,

244
00:31:45,768 --> 00:31:50,711
[SPEAKER_05]: But I believe it was in that group of positions and for the reasons that you're stating, yes.

245
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:53,992
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, thank you.

246
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,495
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, if there are no other questions, then I think we could probably move on.

247
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:08,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So this next one, there was a typo with respect to the number represented in the previous slide.

248
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,782
[SPEAKER_05]: So one reason to highlight this, the conversion of the library positions was

249
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,982
[SPEAKER_05]: because we had the number wrong, which I apologize for yesterday.

250
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:21,644
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other reason is that we didn't have the opportunity to expand upon it.

251
00:32:21,744 --> 00:32:26,127
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is another issue that's circulated around the organization for some time.

252
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:27,888
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding from Ms.

253
00:32:27,928 --> 00:32:33,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Sladen is that the last time the district employed a librarian in each school was in 2008.

254
00:32:35,013 --> 00:32:43,438
[SPEAKER_05]: The work of a school librarian has changed since 2008, but we still think that there's value there

255
00:32:44,073 --> 00:32:54,181
[SPEAKER_05]: And the question that we've been deliberating through the budget process is, well, there's a consensus that this would be a good thing for our schools.

256
00:32:54,421 --> 00:32:58,584
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd ask either Dr. Cushing or Ms.

257
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Gluski, you wanna expand upon that.

258
00:33:01,707 --> 00:33:12,595
[SPEAKER_05]: We also know that without a change to the structure and the programming that we're offering through our library media centers,

259
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:24,069
[SPEAKER_05]: merely changing the position from a non-certified position to a certified position, the implications of that are somewhat diminished.

260
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:35,756
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it is something that it was something that in a school committee member survey was a very common response as to something that the members of the committee feel strongly about.

261
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I think there is a consensus there.

262
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a priority that's shared between the committee and the administration.

263
00:33:42,690 --> 00:34:02,358
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably the case that this is a question of if, excuse me, of when, but not if, that as an organization, we want to move toward having the certified librarians so that we can establish that high quality programming and the type of library literacy that can come with that type of commitment.

264
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:10,842
[SPEAKER_05]: And the question that we're looking at now is looking at the broader budgetary context, would this be the correct fiscal year?

265
00:34:12,054 --> 00:34:13,435
[SPEAKER_05]: to make that change.

266
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:14,816
[SPEAKER_05]: So Ms.

267
00:34:14,836 --> 00:34:19,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Galussi or Dr. Cushing, would either of you like to expand upon that?

268
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I don't believe Ms.

269
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:24,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Layden, who was with us last night, had a scheduling conflict.

270
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,225
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think that she's on the call tonight.

271
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:31,770
[SPEAKER_05]: But if either of you would like to comment, I'd be happy to take a breath.

272
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:50,976
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the only thing that I would add is just at the elementary level right now it's a little scattered in terms of like library rotation so kindergarten through second grade really tends to go to the library weekly.

273
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:56,138
[SPEAKER_09]: But the offerings and when they're at the library it's kind of primarily.

274
00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:59,019
[SPEAKER_09]: with the sole purpose of like signing out books.

275
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:10,665
[SPEAKER_09]: By adding this piece and full librarians, it would allow at the elementary level for a more instructional component in terms of library and media.

276
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:16,988
[SPEAKER_09]: It would also bring in on a more consistent basis for grades three through five.

277
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:36,320
[SPEAKER_09]: The logistics of like this, the planning and scheduling are the things that would have to be worked out just to ensure the balance of like time and learning, but it would add an instructional lift to the library offering that's currently in place right now.

278
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:45,915
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to follow up to make sure that each school has a librarian, it allows for the library media center to become a place of discourse and dialogue.

279
00:35:46,775 --> 00:35:53,179
[SPEAKER_08]: It allows for them to really plan cohesive lessons to support students as they research.

280
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:02,185
[SPEAKER_08]: And as libraries now tend to also include a maker space, something that right now I believe only our high school library does.

281
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:14,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And just want to make sure, as I don't, I'm not 100% familiar with all of our elementary libraries, but I do know that our high school library is the only one with a maker space for our secondary schools.

282
00:36:15,168 --> 00:36:22,230
[SPEAKER_08]: It becomes an opportunity to really engage students across more than just checking out books, as Ms.

283
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Scalusi mentioned.

284
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:32,273
[SPEAKER_08]: And really want people to really think about that debate and discourse, that dialogue and discourse that can happen in a well-run media center.

285
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:34,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

286
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:35,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

287
00:36:35,275 --> 00:36:35,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Pelosi.

288
00:36:36,516 --> 00:36:39,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham, did you have your hand up still?

289
00:36:40,096 --> 00:36:40,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I did.

290
00:36:41,036 --> 00:36:59,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to ask the administration to consider how we could move from a really non-functional and untenable situation at the elementary level library to something that demonstrates progress.

291
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,201
[SPEAKER_12]: a 0.6 FTE spread across four buildings.

292
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:10,044
[SPEAKER_12]: Like she could be superwoman and there would be next to nothing that she could reasonably accomplish.

293
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:26,952
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and I've watched this as a volunteer myself since long before I was on the school committee, there's a whole host of like missed opportunity in terms of educational opportunity for kids that would obviously need

294
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:45,622
[SPEAKER_12]: dedicated support, you know, dedicated individuals at like a 1.0 level in terms of like when you look at library best practice, but I also want us to think about the fact that the current structure is totally unsustainable.

295
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:49,984
[SPEAKER_12]: So progress, even if it's not all of this,

296
00:37:52,141 --> 00:38:07,870
[SPEAKER_12]: could be meaningful and I also share the concerns and commentary around needing a curriculum and an approach for staff when we get there.

297
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:14,613
[SPEAKER_12]: It cannot be homegrown, it cannot be pieced together by strapped resources inside the district.

298
00:38:15,314 --> 00:38:17,615
[SPEAKER_12]: There is content out there

299
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:25,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and I think we, if we're going to invest, we need to think about a curriculum that.

300
00:38:26,168 --> 00:38:28,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, supports the investment as well at some point in time.

301
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:45,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Um, so again, I think this is something that, um, we have, uh, the administration has heard the advocacy, uh, both from administrators, from community members, from committee members.

302
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:48,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and there's a, there's a real desire to.

303
00:38:49,512 --> 00:38:50,433
[SPEAKER_05]: to move forward with this.

304
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:54,315
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, at this point, a question of timing and whether or not some of those other pieces that Ms.

305
00:38:54,335 --> 00:39:02,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Graham spoke about that have to happen in conjunction with the personnel change, if the timing is right for that.

306
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's something that we'll be continuing to look through over the coming weeks.

307
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:15,328
[SPEAKER_05]: And as is the case with every single priority on this list, it will need to be weighed against the rest of the context in terms of

308
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:23,977
[SPEAKER_05]: where we go in terms of what ultimately is prioritized and for purposes of implementation.

309
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:41,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had mentioned last night that Mr. Fallon would join us and that while in a lot of ways we're highlighting some of the specific changes from one budget over to the next, that's how we've established to try to move as efficiently as possible through this.

310
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:55,563
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the pieces that was referenced, I believe, in just about every survey that we collected was the need to be looking thoughtfully at the strategic expansion of our vocational programming.

311
00:39:56,003 --> 00:40:11,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And the vocational programming is unique amongst the various components of the organization, both in terms of some of its costs and in terms of the, I'll let Mr. Fallon speak to the educational benefits of vocational programming,

312
00:40:11,573 --> 00:40:25,100
[SPEAKER_05]: and how unique that is, although it certainly is, but also the structure of its finance with regard to the reliance on some of the external funds and the need for us to maintain staffing that is commensurate with the level of student interest.

313
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:30,722
[SPEAKER_05]: In Manford, as Mr. Fallon will expand upon, we have a tremendous amount of student interest.

314
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:34,764
[SPEAKER_05]: It is student interest that is growing significantly.

315
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:51,273
[SPEAKER_05]: In some ways, as I know Mr. Fallon could articulate, it may outpace our ability to staff appropriately, but we're doing our best to keep up with that, to make sure that we've got a staffing structure in place that supports the growth of that program.

316
00:40:51,313 --> 00:41:05,898
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm going to now ask Mr. Fallon to speak a little bit about both a reminder as to the external funding piece and what that investment translates into, the growing level of engagement and interest in the programming,

317
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:16,779
[SPEAKER_05]: and how the staffing proposals that you saw on the slide last night that Mr. Fallon can talk a little bit more about, how that's sort of connected to one another.

318
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll move on to going through the rest of the priorities.

319
00:41:21,723 --> 00:41:28,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So Dr. Cushing, you should have a three slide deck from Mr. Fallon if you wanna put that up on the screen.

320
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:32,932
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mr. Fallon, happy to hear from you at that point.

321
00:41:35,573 --> 00:41:36,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, everyone.

322
00:41:36,334 --> 00:41:39,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Madam School, Madam Mayor, school committee, school administration.

323
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:40,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to see you.

324
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:43,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Pull up my screen here.

325
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:43,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

326
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

327
00:41:50,284 --> 00:41:51,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, are you going to share your screen?

328
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:53,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the plan or you want me to?

329
00:42:00,191 --> 00:42:03,934
[SPEAKER_08]: They have not come through on the email, so if you can share your screen, that would be beneficial.

330
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:05,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry about that.

331
00:42:05,576 --> 00:42:08,938
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my fault that I tried to send it back to both of you guys.

332
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:12,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I just shared it with you a few minutes ago, Peter.

333
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see if it'll let me share.

334
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:13,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it will.

335
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, nope, it won't.

336
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,721
[SPEAKER_07]: Open system preferences, hold on.

337
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:20,622
[SPEAKER_07]: I could share it.

338
00:42:21,102 --> 00:42:22,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, if you could do that, that'd be great.

339
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:26,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I could share it, hold on.

340
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:31,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize in advance.

341
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:33,166
[SPEAKER_07]: The allergies hit me good today, so.

342
00:42:35,402 --> 00:42:37,423
[SPEAKER_07]: all the windows in my house being open.

343
00:42:37,443 --> 00:42:38,483
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like a great idea.

344
00:42:38,503 --> 00:42:41,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the morning I wake up not feeling well.

345
00:42:41,904 --> 00:42:42,204
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

346
00:42:42,844 --> 00:42:44,225
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for giving me a few minutes.

347
00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:48,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna run down a few things that happened this year, really the big ticket items.

348
00:42:49,287 --> 00:42:56,969
[SPEAKER_07]: This year we were fortunate enough to receive our third skills capital grant in my time in Medford.

349
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,370
[SPEAKER_07]: This time it was for 314,000.

350
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was specifically for our construction program.

351
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:11,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Some highlights from what we've purchased with that funding for the program was a bobcat, a couple trailers, many different types of tools.

352
00:43:11,345 --> 00:43:16,391
[SPEAKER_07]: We bought two Ford F-150s, about one 15-passenger van that is still on order.

353
00:43:16,431 --> 00:43:18,193
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get that hopefully by the end of the school year.

354
00:43:19,374 --> 00:43:24,219
[SPEAKER_07]: And various other things for the shop, scaffolding, cement frames.

355
00:43:25,304 --> 00:43:27,566
[SPEAKER_07]: really everything you could think we need, we were able to get.

356
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:31,810
[SPEAKER_07]: We still have probably about $40,000 left on that to spend before June 30th.

357
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:37,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Under Perkins, that's an annual grant, an allocation grant that we get, 64,000.

358
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually it's right around that amount.

359
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:42,619
[SPEAKER_07]: With that, I bought five more of the Promethean panels.

360
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:46,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Promethean panels you can think of are just like smart boards, but they're the newest in the technology.

361
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:48,405
[SPEAKER_07]: They're mobile, so they can move between my programs.

362
00:43:48,865 --> 00:43:49,646
[SPEAKER_07]: The teachers love them.

363
00:43:49,706 --> 00:43:50,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a touchscreen.

364
00:43:51,447 --> 00:43:56,348
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's fairly easy to access internet and hook up to your laptop or sync your device.

365
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:57,909
[SPEAKER_07]: So the teachers love those.

366
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:58,749
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got five more.

367
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,569
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we have 10 of those, so almost one per program.

368
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Fallon, Mayor, can I just ask a quick question while we're going through?

369
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that okay, or do you want to go through?

370
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:09,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I just was wondering how much those cost.

371
00:44:09,111 --> 00:44:10,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Those sound really interesting.

372
00:44:10,412 --> 00:44:11,032
[SPEAKER_04]: How much are those?

373
00:44:11,052 --> 00:44:11,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know, Mr. Fallon?

374
00:44:12,272 --> 00:44:14,012
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about $26,000 for five.

375
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:19,494
[SPEAKER_07]: There are 72-inch screens on a mobile unit, so they're pretty impressive.

376
00:44:19,514 --> 00:44:19,734
[SPEAKER_07]: So about $26,000.

377
00:44:21,288 --> 00:44:21,629
[SPEAKER_07]: for those.

378
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:30,076
[SPEAKER_07]: In graphic design under Perkins, I was able to get a new paper cutter and I allotted about $8,000 for metal fabrication supplies and equipment.

379
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:34,339
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were able to use some of this for flooring and paint for the new graphic design shop.

380
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:39,504
[SPEAKER_07]: The beauty of Perkins is they don't, they support anything that you purchase for equipment.

381
00:44:39,624 --> 00:44:42,526
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't use Perkins for salaries, which is easier for us.

382
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:43,907
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use it strictly for equipment.

383
00:44:43,927 --> 00:44:48,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, next slide.

384
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:56,785
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this is interesting and exciting and scary all at the same time.

385
00:44:57,285 --> 00:45:00,727
[SPEAKER_07]: We just did our numbers for next year for fresh for rising freshmen.

386
00:45:01,787 --> 00:45:05,849
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 328 students coming up to the high school next year 233 of them so 71% of the rising freshman class.

387
00:45:09,878 --> 00:45:13,200
[SPEAKER_07]: has chosen a CTE pathway, which is great.

388
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:23,367
[SPEAKER_07]: However, as Mr. Murphy mentioned, we are entering kind of, I would say within the next few years, we're gonna need to make, like I'm doing this year, I'm proposing additional teachers because there's the need for it.

389
00:45:24,408 --> 00:45:30,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Also important to know that 45% of the students in grades 10 through 12 at Medford High School are now enrolled in a CTE pathway.

390
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a major shift from what we're used to in years past.

391
00:45:35,511 --> 00:45:43,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's forcing us to look at academic offerings, too, to make sure that we have a balance between programs to make sure that we have additional teachers to help.

392
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:51,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Where in the past, let's say we only needed three or four English teachers on the vocational side, we're going to need to look at teachers on the high school side as well.

393
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:54,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's all a good problem to have, but it is forcing us to make some decisions.

394
00:45:54,998 --> 00:45:58,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So as I said, Grade 9, we have 233 students coming in for freshman rotation.

395
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Grade 10, we have 162.

396
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:02,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Grade 11, 136.

397
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:04,602
[SPEAKER_07]: And senior class of 132.

398
00:46:05,883 --> 00:46:07,344
[SPEAKER_07]: So these numbers continue to rise.

399
00:46:07,384 --> 00:46:11,866
[SPEAKER_07]: To give you some perspective, this year we have about 118 seniors graduating.

400
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:17,648
[SPEAKER_07]: So a total of 643 students are on a CTE pathway now at our lovely school.

401
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:18,889
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're very excited.

402
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:35,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So with all that said, for the past I believe three years I have asked for a level funded budget, because as Mr Murphy mentioned I do have other sources of income, those were pretty much depleted during coven and during the shutdown.

403
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,550
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we do have the ability to generate some money, we have.

404
00:46:40,959 --> 00:46:52,950
[SPEAKER_07]: revolving accounts for several of my programs so automotive culinary graphic design, we have programs that raise money that we can use that money gets put directly back into the program we don't use it for anything else other than those programs.

405
00:46:54,292 --> 00:47:00,958
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have the tuition that i'm able to accept for out of district students which this year i've been working with Belmont.

406
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:02,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Watertown and Sudbury.

407
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:09,357
[SPEAKER_07]: As crazy as it may seem, Sudbury is very interested in us because they consider us a neighboring school district.

408
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:19,906
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a lack of seats statewide for students in vocational programming, so what we're really doing is we're doing right by students by offering them programming if they want it.

409
00:47:19,986 --> 00:47:23,770
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many students who did not get into their vocational programming in their regional school district,

410
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:29,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've heard the good things that are happening in Medford and we've become a district of choice for those three schools.

411
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:41,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, what's going to happen is we are going to have an agreement with all three towns, so that they understand when I met with them it was it was difficult because I told them I would love to help, but I also have to keep my Medford.

412
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:45,204
[SPEAKER_07]: family in mind and we have programs that fill up really quickly.

413
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:53,752
[SPEAKER_07]: The districts I'm working with are so happy that they have an option that they're willing to go into an agreement with us that basically says there are some programs that we know fill up quickly.

414
00:47:54,372 --> 00:48:02,139
[SPEAKER_07]: My fear was that if we offer a spot to a Belmont or a Watertown or a Sudbury student and they were placed in a program that typically fills up,

415
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:20,687
[SPEAKER_07]: how would that feel to a medford student so they understood my concern so we're going to have an agreement going forward that basically we can offer seats to out of district students based on availability so if if we have a program that fills on medford residents then we leave it that way so we still have maintained that um as you know seats for our students

416
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,051
[SPEAKER_07]: that's another source of income.

417
00:48:24,092 --> 00:48:32,197
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand how the calculation works, but that is my goal this year to find out how the state figures out how to give us our designation for tuition.

418
00:48:33,057 --> 00:48:36,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year for a school district to send a student to Medford was $12,314.

419
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,822
[SPEAKER_07]: This year or next year went down to $10,000 and change.

420
00:48:41,383 --> 00:48:42,564
[SPEAKER_07]: So not a lot, but it

421
00:48:43,564 --> 00:48:50,910
[SPEAKER_07]: It all has to do with per pupil expenditures and things that are, Dave, I'm sure understands all this, but I'm still learning.

422
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:54,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Bottom line is that that is another income source for us.

423
00:48:54,493 --> 00:49:00,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I've been able to do is take that money and put it into an account, and I'm able to use that to put right back into the school for the many projects we did this year.

424
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:09,346
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that said, I do know that I have some money available, and I do have some revolving lines that are now making some money again as we open back up.

425
00:49:10,843 --> 00:49:15,965
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're looking for is two additional instructors this year.

426
00:49:16,566 --> 00:49:18,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Health assisting, this will actually be a third teacher.

427
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:26,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you remember correctly, last year, I asked for a third teacher in electrical and construction, and we did receive those teachers.

428
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,591
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's been helpful.

429
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:29,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the two of our most popular programs.

430
00:49:30,452 --> 00:49:40,719
[SPEAKER_07]: Health Assisting, we're going to be able now to take in a few more students, but really this third instructor is allowing us to be able to do our clinical rotations in a more efficient manner.

431
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:47,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now with two teachers, one that teaches freshmen and sophomores, it's difficult when the upper class teacher wants to be out with the upper class students.

432
00:49:48,124 --> 00:49:48,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Two issues happen.

433
00:49:49,825 --> 00:49:51,665
[SPEAKER_07]: One, sometimes we don't have enough room in the van.

434
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:56,166
[SPEAKER_07]: And two, sometimes we don't have enough coverage for the students that are coming in later in the day.

435
00:49:56,646 --> 00:50:06,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So a third teacher would be able to work really with the upper class teacher for clinical rotations, drive the second van, be available for students that may not be ready to go out.

436
00:50:07,148 --> 00:50:15,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So the rationale for that is that this is a popular program, and we need to make sure that we have enough coverage for these students while also keeping in mind

437
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:30,321
[SPEAKER_07]: not all students can go out on clinical rotation, it's a 12 to 1 ratio, so sometimes we're balancing, you know, one group will go over to Winchester Rehab, you know, Monday, Wednesday, another Tuesday, Thursday, and it gets a little confusing and it's not really ideal, so that's why we're asking for that.

438
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:36,692
[SPEAKER_07]: The second position is a teaching assistant position, which would be similar in pay to Kids' Corner.

439
00:50:37,792 --> 00:50:41,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I have reached out to our finance department just to find out what that pays.

440
00:50:41,933 --> 00:50:43,274
[SPEAKER_07]: It will not be a full-time teacher.

441
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:46,295
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not need to be vocational instructor certified.

442
00:50:46,815 --> 00:50:49,596
[SPEAKER_07]: This is specifically for our Make Way for Kids program.

443
00:50:49,616 --> 00:50:51,417
[SPEAKER_07]: So in our early childhood education program,

444
00:50:52,663 --> 00:50:59,828
[SPEAKER_07]: We, we have seen kind of a plateau, if you will, of student enrollment for high school.

445
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:08,494
[SPEAKER_07]: So we changed some things this year, I have the upper class teacher bringing the students out to the Brooks Elementary School launch and learn and creative corner.

446
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:14,721
[SPEAKER_07]: The success at the Brooks School has, it's been amazing that the teachers have enjoyed them.

447
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:22,426
[SPEAKER_07]: So really the students are working in the kindergarten classroom and the pre kindergarten classroom, because I wanted the upper class students to get more experience above and beyond a daycare setting.

448
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:29,792
[SPEAKER_07]: You know if a student wants to get a job at Bright Horizons that's fine but I want people to remember that you can be a teacher, but part of this program is also to teach you.

449
00:51:31,293 --> 00:51:33,093
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, how to be an early education educator.

450
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:37,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So that has gone well, thanks to Suzanne Galluzzi for her support on that.

451
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:48,596
[SPEAKER_07]: So the teaching assistant is really just gonna be someone who's in the classroom here within the high school for the Make Way for Kids preschool program that operates three days a week in the morning, two days a week in the afternoon.

452
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:55,097
[SPEAKER_07]: That allows the freshmen and the sophomore students to have some experience with kids because they don't leave the building for that.

453
00:51:56,618 --> 00:51:58,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions on the instructor positions before I move on?

454
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:02,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

455
00:52:03,027 --> 00:52:05,388
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also asking for an increase in three of our lines.

456
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:07,289
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a direct result of two things.

457
00:52:07,649 --> 00:52:11,611
[SPEAKER_07]: One, the cost of materials, as everyone knows, has gone up tremendously.

458
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:13,252
[SPEAKER_07]: And two, the enrollment.

459
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:17,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were able to get by because we didn't spend some of our revolving funds during the pandemic.

460
00:52:17,615 --> 00:52:20,016
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've now depleted those lines.

461
00:52:20,276 --> 00:52:30,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And after my budget analysis, I realized that without an extra $75,000 in my regular operating budget, I won't be able to provide the same level of service that we've done in the past.

462
00:52:31,222 --> 00:52:35,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm looking for a $50,000 increase due to the rise in enrollment under instructional supplies.

463
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:42,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for an additional $10,000 in the textbook line for online subscriptions and online textbooks.

464
00:52:43,084 --> 00:52:47,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm looking for an additional $15,000 in our instructional equipment line.

465
00:52:49,945 --> 00:52:51,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions on those items?

466
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:02,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine, Dr. Cushing.

467
00:53:05,502 --> 00:53:06,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Mr. Fallon.

468
00:53:07,323 --> 00:53:20,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, as we mentioned last night, the vocational program is unique, both from a funding perspective as well as from a programmatic one.

469
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:29,078
[SPEAKER_05]: And due to the consistency of the advocacy that we heard from the committee related to making sure that we're keeping a close eye on

470
00:53:31,902 --> 00:53:35,063
[SPEAKER_05]: on those programs and making sure that we're expanding in a responsible way.

471
00:53:35,604 --> 00:53:42,226
[SPEAKER_05]: The committee is also familiar with the district's statement of interest that was recently submitted to the MSBA.

472
00:53:42,826 --> 00:53:54,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And I imagine that it was going to say you can infer, but you can more than infer from that application the extent to which we know that we need to make sure that our infrastructure

473
00:53:55,742 --> 00:54:03,505
[SPEAKER_05]: is consistent with the needs of students and with the educational objectives of our flagship school.

474
00:54:04,566 --> 00:54:08,487
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that made up a large part of that application.

475
00:54:08,547 --> 00:54:15,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would imagine would make up a large part of the school's educational identity, excuse me, going forward.

476
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:20,772
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we go back to the main deck,

477
00:54:21,698 --> 00:54:26,121
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Cushing, there's a couple other quick points related to the categorization of the vocational priorities.

478
00:54:26,161 --> 00:54:32,166
[SPEAKER_05]: But before we let Mr. Fallon go, are there any questions from the committee for Chad?

479
00:54:34,247 --> 00:54:34,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor?

480
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:38,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

481
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:39,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

482
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:40,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

483
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:44,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always good to hear from you, hear about your success of your programs.

484
00:54:44,935 --> 00:54:45,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Great school.

485
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:46,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

486
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:58,031
[SPEAKER_04]: And toward that end, I was wondering if the ECE, if there's an opportunity or are there any ideas for expansion on that program to our other, any of our other elementary schools?

487
00:54:58,071 --> 00:55:03,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, to that point, there are so many opportunities for this program to grow.

488
00:55:03,236 --> 00:55:04,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that you said it plateaued.

489
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:07,399
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think there's an opportunity for that in the future?

490
00:55:07,439 --> 00:55:10,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wondering as it's, you know, being raised, it sounds like a great program.

491
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:12,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, absolutely.

492
00:55:12,993 --> 00:55:16,214
[SPEAKER_07]: Shannon Deimos has been great this year because they were really our pilot school.

493
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:21,697
[SPEAKER_07]: But we started back in, maybe it was December, January.

494
00:55:22,298 --> 00:55:26,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And I now have the schools asking me, how can we make this a permanent thing for next year?

495
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,880
[SPEAKER_07]: How can we make this a co-op opportunity?

496
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:31,122
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, there's definitely possibilities.

497
00:55:31,142 --> 00:55:32,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And the students love it too.

498
00:55:32,283 --> 00:55:33,343
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been really fun.

499
00:55:33,743 --> 00:55:36,445
[SPEAKER_07]: So I envision next year us entering two more elementary schools.

500
00:55:36,465 --> 00:55:38,146
[SPEAKER_07]: So the good news is we do have,

501
00:55:39,186 --> 00:55:40,988
[SPEAKER_07]: enough upper class students right now.

502
00:55:41,209 --> 00:55:46,635
[SPEAKER_07]: My fear is that like right now we only have three students as freshmen who chose it for sophomore year.

503
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:48,197
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll change a little bit.

504
00:55:48,237 --> 00:55:51,220
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, some people might start the year next year and realize they want to change.

505
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:59,330
[SPEAKER_07]: The sophomores wouldn't be going out anyways, but we do, you know, we have a healthy amount of rising juniors and seniors that will definitely keep this up.

506
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:00,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

507
00:56:00,615 --> 00:56:15,408
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would also just, if I may suggest, you know, partnership with or discussion with Mrs. Bowen's team as well, just to, particularly, I think of people who might be interested in early intervention or other, you know, sort of aspects of special education on that realm.

508
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:19,111
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it'd be interesting to look at that opportunity.

509
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:20,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you so much.

510
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:21,453
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

511
00:56:21,673 --> 00:56:22,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

512
00:56:23,474 --> 00:56:25,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor, I just wanted to comment also.

513
00:56:27,463 --> 00:56:49,253
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I just wanted to say, I went to the open house and I Sharon was there as well and it was so wonderful to see all the programs and it's just, it was phenomenal and I got to see some of the new skills capital equipment, you know firsthand, and it's just really amazing and all the great things and.

514
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:55,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the students were there and they were showing some projects and it's just so wonderful.

515
00:56:55,536 --> 00:57:00,359
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I'm so happy to hear about the, you know, the increase in the enrollment.

516
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:04,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just, it's wonderful and it's a great opportunity for everybody.

517
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:06,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for the presentation.

518
00:57:06,222 --> 00:57:06,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

519
00:57:07,182 --> 00:57:07,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

520
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:08,983
[SPEAKER_07]: You're still our super fan.

521
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:09,563
[SPEAKER_07]: You've still held.

522
00:57:09,723 --> 00:57:12,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

523
00:57:13,025 --> 00:57:16,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I can just, uh, piggyback to as well.

524
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:16,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

525
00:57:17,161 --> 00:57:28,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I have extensive conversations with Mr. Fallon about ways that we can expand our programming at the vocational in the years to come, career technical education across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

526
00:57:28,724 --> 00:57:34,766
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you who don't know, the regional schools are extraordinarily competitive to get into.

527
00:57:35,226 --> 00:57:42,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And the fact that Medford has this opportunity for its students without the competition is a real resource.

528
00:57:43,528 --> 00:57:52,052
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, having been a principal of a middle school where kids were devastated when they did not get into a regional school, I can see the effects firsthand.

529
00:57:53,273 --> 00:57:59,396
[SPEAKER_08]: We're constantly looking at ways that we can bolster programs, bring in new programs, and support students.

530
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:07,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We have amazing faculty, not just at the vocational across our district who are working so hard, but the faculty at the vocational

531
00:58:07,509 --> 00:58:15,053
[SPEAKER_08]: do such an amazing job of recruiting kids, getting their students truly excited and really selling their programs.

532
00:58:15,213 --> 00:58:30,581
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know for some of our programs that may have some lingering enrollments, they're working, they're really doubling their efforts and they're really working exceptionally hard to make sure that students see the value and the long-term career potential

533
00:58:31,402 --> 00:58:40,650
[SPEAKER_08]: that comes from a quality CTE education like Medford Vocational offers in our high school.

534
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:49,118
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to commend Mr. Fallon and his team for all the work and this tremendous opportunity and have also had the extensive conversations

535
00:58:49,618 --> 00:58:58,281
[SPEAKER_08]: surrounding other communities being a part of it, but not usurping a Medford student's opportunity to be in some of those programs.

536
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:05,383
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully we'll be able to fill out some programs while not competing with our own students.

537
00:59:08,524 --> 00:59:09,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

538
00:59:09,485 --> 00:59:10,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Principal Fallon.

539
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:18,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Roman seems, if I'm hearing, yeah, heard it correctly, seems like it's skyrocketing.

540
00:59:19,225 --> 00:59:22,532
[SPEAKER_03]: testament to how good of a job you're doing.

541
00:59:22,572 --> 00:59:28,665
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thankful that Make Way for Kids has the opportunity to survive and continue on.

542
00:59:30,138 --> 00:59:31,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayor, thank you.

543
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:43,432
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, I just wanted to also say thank you to Mr. Fallon for his presentation and just with all the numbers that were presented and seeing that, you know, nearly 600 students.

544
00:59:44,713 --> 00:59:52,380
[SPEAKER_10]: When I met with Mr. Fallon and saying like, what are the numbers, what do we think will be our Medford numbers in another two years time?

545
00:59:53,121 --> 01:00:12,527
[SPEAKER_10]: So with 1300 students at the high school, it's possible that we could end up with 7, 8, 900 students wanting to participate in vocational programming, the excellent programming that is happening right now, and possibly bringing on other programs.

546
01:00:13,127 --> 01:00:15,468
[SPEAKER_10]: So it is something that we know we need to work on.

547
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:40,111
[SPEAKER_10]: in terms of properly marketing the great education that is available in the vocational CTE programming, but for people to also take away the stigma of long ago, where they thought vocational programming was for students that had difficulty learning, and that it wasn't for students that had high aspirations.

548
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:43,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Just being in our robotics and engineering,

549
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:53,401
[SPEAKER_10]: where they're going to be going to California, and they just displayed a Tetris game that the robotics and engineering students built.

550
01:00:53,841 --> 01:00:55,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now in the front foyer.

551
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:01,646
[SPEAKER_10]: next to the mural on the left hand side so that got mounted yesterday.

552
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:12,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And so seeing robotics and engineering students, I believe it was the construction students that had the lifts, just the different

553
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:22,487
[SPEAKER_10]: the different programs working together to accomplish something to display their great work at the high school.

554
01:01:23,227 --> 01:01:25,228
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just feel the potential is really great.

555
01:01:25,508 --> 01:01:38,433
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's something that, you know, families that are in middle school and trying to make sure that we really let them know all of the great programming that is going to be available and for us not to discount, you know,

556
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:50,763
[SPEAKER_10]: CTE programming because you can have a CTE degree and still go to college and have a degree and have a career by the time you graduate from high school.

557
01:01:50,803 --> 01:01:56,347
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a great opportunity and it's something that we really need to celebrate and support.

558
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:57,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

559
01:01:57,708 --> 01:02:03,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

560
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:06,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you again, Mr. Fallon.

561
01:02:08,007 --> 01:02:09,848
[SPEAKER_05]: we want to just go back to the main deck.

562
01:02:09,868 --> 01:02:11,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll continue making our way through.

563
01:02:11,629 --> 01:02:35,143
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, while Dr. Cushing puts that up, I do want to say that we are organized these budget meetings this year around the themes that we've talked about of equity and support for our most vulnerable students and utilization of technology and how we're structured as an organization and how we're coming back from COVID and every

564
01:02:36,027 --> 01:02:53,038
[SPEAKER_05]: as we were sort of pulling out the various budgetary priorities, every administrator, every school community put forth really a thoughtful recitation of the ways in which they were prepared to invest in students.

565
01:02:53,099 --> 01:03:01,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I would just say that Mr. Fallon is really representative of the strength of the team that put forth those

566
01:03:01,942 --> 01:03:16,953
[SPEAKER_05]: priorities and those objectives that we've tried to then synthesize and articulate for the committee and for the community, where we're going and how it is we're trying to make the most of the funding that's available to us.

567
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:21,896
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could just slide back, I think one, yeah, exactly.

568
01:03:21,937 --> 01:03:22,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

569
01:03:23,478 --> 01:03:30,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to, again, point out the sort of how we're looking at this and how

570
01:03:31,496 --> 01:03:48,409
[SPEAKER_05]: These priorities are developing and we're trying to make sure that it is not the case that the superintendent has been clear that our team is not responsible for just providing to the school committee the longest list and the most expensive list we can.

571
01:03:48,449 --> 01:04:00,158
[SPEAKER_05]: We're responsible for presenting to you a recommendation that is cohesive and that is coherent and is ambitious because we have high ambitions for our students and for the organization.

572
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:14,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Mr. So pointed out last night, that I point out a few times per meeting, and I'll continue to do so that the administration understands our responsibility to be planning for various contingencies.

573
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:19,901
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the municipal government will balance its competing priorities.

574
01:04:20,781 --> 01:04:27,365
[SPEAKER_05]: We will put forth a thoughtful rationale to what will be a high number.

575
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:30,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're already at a high number, so there's no getting around that.

576
01:04:31,573 --> 01:04:45,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, we want to make a request that is sufficiently coherent so that we can, in fact, maximize the public's investment in this organization.

577
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:49,646
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is what we are in the process of developing.

578
01:04:50,567 --> 01:04:58,653
[SPEAKER_05]: So with respect to the categories, you can see, as Mr. Fallon said, that the health assisting certified teacher position and the early childhood assistant teacher position

579
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:08,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Those based on the programming needs and making sure that we're continuing to operate the vocational programming at the high level that has been discussed tonight.

580
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:13,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the critical priorities that we really think we need to find a way to incorporate into the operating budget.

581
01:05:14,468 --> 01:05:23,015
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that there are other positions in various disciplines that because the programs are growing should be considered and will need to be considered in the years ahead.

582
01:05:23,915 --> 01:05:25,957
[SPEAKER_05]: The media technology position is one that

583
01:05:27,328 --> 01:05:30,669
[SPEAKER_05]: As Mr. Fallon knows, it's something that we're taking a close look at.

584
01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:39,312
[SPEAKER_05]: It has not been, at this point, considered to reach the level of urgency that the health assistant and the assistant teacher position have.

585
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:54,018
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is something that, along with some of the other chapter 74 programs, similar to electrical, and I believe, not business marketing, but, sorry, Joe, what was the other position we added for FY20?

586
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Health assisting early childhood mental health.

587
01:05:58,615 --> 01:06:05,842
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm sorry, I mean for FYI 22 was electrical and electrical and construction craft labors construction craft labors Thank you very much.

588
01:06:06,442 --> 01:06:17,873
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that was the FYI 22 priority and you can anticipate that in succeeding fiscal years as those programs continue to grow, you'll be hearing more about these various disciplines.

589
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:27,626
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's something that we're in an ongoing dialogue with Mr. Fallon about, and again, the committee will hear more about that in the future, I'm sure.

590
01:06:28,246 --> 01:06:39,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, if we wanna move forward, one of the pieces, again, this is another sort of minor typographical issue, somewhat minor to the tune of, I guess, 22,500, if that's minor.

591
01:06:39,072 --> 01:06:40,733
[SPEAKER_05]: We had listed a $25,000 budgetary priority for

592
01:06:46,477 --> 01:06:49,659
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the more accessible desk equipment.

593
01:06:50,019 --> 01:06:52,961
[SPEAKER_05]: That number was supposed to be 2,500 last night.

594
01:06:53,061 --> 01:06:56,744
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is something that if Ms.

595
01:06:56,764 --> 01:07:03,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowen, if you'd like to speak to, but that's just, I just wanted to make sure that that was clear that we've corrected that.

596
01:07:03,248 --> 01:07:06,169
[SPEAKER_05]: If there aren't any questions about it, we can probably just move on to the next slide.

597
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:09,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want me to speak about it at all?

598
01:07:09,872 --> 01:07:10,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Only if there are questions.

599
01:07:10,832 --> 01:07:13,134
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted everyone to know that it's not going to cost 25,000 for the desk.

600
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:13,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

601
01:07:17,175 --> 01:07:18,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the correction.

602
01:07:18,697 --> 01:07:19,117
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

603
01:07:20,938 --> 01:07:30,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so then as we move forward in this, again, you can just, Mr. Fallon has already spoken to the $75,000 investment in the supply line.

604
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:33,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, that is the working number right now.

605
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:41,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Like everything here, we're gonna continue to examine it and see if there are places in which there are potential savings that could potentially subsume that.

606
01:07:42,196 --> 01:07:45,399
[SPEAKER_05]: We recognize that the increasing costs of everything

607
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:52,150
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to have a disproportionate effect on certain CTE programs that are dependent upon various types of supplies.

608
01:07:52,831 --> 01:07:57,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the nature of the economy is that they're going to have a disproportionate impact there.

609
01:07:58,272 --> 01:08:03,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It may be the case that we're able to absorb some of that cost in other places within the budget.

610
01:08:03,173 --> 01:08:12,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it may not necessarily be a full $75,000 increase that would be represented here, which is when we get to the end of this conversation, we see the totals.

611
01:08:13,021 --> 01:08:24,886
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the same totals from last night, because even something like a $75,000 increase, which hopefully will not have to be a $75,000 increase, will not necessarily affect some of those numbers that you saw last night.

612
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:33,009
[SPEAKER_05]: The full calculation of the categories that we discussed last night that we'll do for next week, that will obviously affect those numbers.

613
01:08:33,069 --> 01:08:41,372
[SPEAKER_05]: But this type of more minor fluctuation is something that we're anticipating being able to address within the operating budget.

614
01:08:42,397 --> 01:08:43,318
[SPEAKER_05]: or at least the projections.

615
01:08:44,098 --> 01:08:44,919
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're gonna move now.

616
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:54,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I had mentioned at the beginning of the meeting that we have the responsibility to look at all potential efficiencies and where there could be potential savings.

617
01:08:55,326 --> 01:09:01,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And while at the secondary level, there's a sort of ripple effect because of the way the schedules operate.

618
01:09:01,650 --> 01:09:07,614
[SPEAKER_05]: At the elementary level, it's a little more straightforward as we monitor enrollment throughout the course of the year.

619
01:09:07,714 --> 01:09:08,875
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna ask Ms.

620
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Galussi to speak a little bit about

621
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:12,224
[SPEAKER_05]: the enrollment trends.

622
01:09:12,264 --> 01:09:18,207
[SPEAKER_05]: We did touch upon this a little bit last night in response to some of the questions, but Ms.

623
01:09:18,247 --> 01:09:25,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Gluzzi is going to speak a little bit about what we're currently seeing in terms of trends and what we're anticipating for.

624
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:40,217
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll talk a little bit about sort of what the budgetary implications of that could be and how what we want to avoid, if possible, is the mad dash to open up additional strands just before the school year begins.

625
01:09:41,011 --> 01:09:56,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the same time, if there's a possibility for strands collapsing based on where we are with respect to enrollment that is budgetary capacity that we can free up and put towards some of the priorities that we've been speaking to you about this week so.

626
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:04,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I don't really need to speak after I think I just explained the point that I was going to make afterwards, but Suzanne if you want to take it from there and then.

627
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:10,984
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, if you want, move straight from there into some of the professional development pieces.

628
01:10:11,024 --> 01:10:13,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to set the table for everyone, Ms.

629
01:10:13,826 --> 01:10:19,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Galizia is going to speak about enrollment at the elementary level, potential implications for strand collapsing.

630
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:24,353
[SPEAKER_05]: That means if, again, you have five classrooms, perhaps you only need four.

631
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:27,394
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just part of our budgetary analysis.

632
01:10:27,775 --> 01:10:33,238
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from there, she's going to, both her and Dr. Cushing are going to speak a little bit about the professional learning objectives.

633
01:10:33,722 --> 01:10:35,483
[SPEAKER_05]: and those investments going into next year.

634
01:10:36,003 --> 01:10:41,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll come back and see how that sort of ties together to our budget forecasting.

635
01:10:41,527 --> 01:10:44,328
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're gonna start with the elementary piece.

636
01:10:44,428 --> 01:10:52,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Mayor, I'd stop for questions there, see if anyone has them, and then we'll transition right from there into the professional learning objectives for fiscal year 23.

637
01:10:54,754 --> 01:10:55,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

638
01:10:55,715 --> 01:10:59,917
[SPEAKER_03]: You can keep going and I'm keeping track of when people do the raise hand function.

639
01:10:59,997 --> 01:11:00,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

640
01:11:00,958 --> 01:11:01,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

641
01:11:02,865 --> 01:11:07,133
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so thank you and good evening, Madam Mayor members of the school committee.

642
01:11:07,594 --> 01:11:11,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So, as Mr Murphy just explained, I'm this right now.

643
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:14,386
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you notice I put the date for today's date.

644
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:20,821
[SPEAKER_09]: enrollment for general education classrooms, K to four.

645
01:11:21,321 --> 01:11:26,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I received this information from our data analysis analyst, Kim Miles.

646
01:11:27,003 --> 01:11:40,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So what is not reflected in these numbers, which I think is important to note are our MEEP enrollment, which I do want to just as a side note, because it was discussed during Mr. Fallon's presentation and

647
01:11:41,867 --> 01:11:47,731
[SPEAKER_09]: The Brooks School currently has three MEAP programs, the McGlynn has one, the Misituck has one, and the Roberts has two.

648
01:11:48,051 --> 01:11:50,412
[SPEAKER_09]: So that adds to the total enrollment of the building.

649
01:11:51,513 --> 01:11:58,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Also absent from these numbers are the newcomer numbers for the classrooms and the special education programming numbers.

650
01:11:59,438 --> 01:12:02,200
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just the general education classroom numbers.

651
01:12:04,948 --> 01:12:19,838
[SPEAKER_09]: These numbers, absent of the other enrollment that I just spoke about, total, I do not have the totals, I apologize, I can add that later, but the total enrollment right now at the Brooks is 480, at the McGlynn's, 444, at the Missituck, it's 465, and at the Roberts, it's 492.

652
01:12:31,006 --> 01:12:34,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Cushing, if you could advance, thank you.

653
01:12:34,687 --> 01:12:43,089
[SPEAKER_09]: So all I did was take the information from that previous slide and show you the four classrooms that we're just keeping an eye on.

654
01:12:43,469 --> 01:12:50,911
[SPEAKER_09]: So currently right now, the second grade and the third grade at the McGlynn have really low enrollment numbers.

655
01:12:51,411 --> 01:12:54,272
[SPEAKER_09]: They have four strands per grade level.

656
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:58,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now in second grade, there's only about 14 or 13 students in a class.

657
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:05,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the current third grade right now at the McGlynn there's only about 12 to 13 students in a class.

658
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:15,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we were going to consolidate those strands, so that would be the rising third grade, and the rising fourth grade.

659
01:13:16,068 --> 01:13:28,234
[SPEAKER_09]: and consolidate four strands to three strands, that would still have numbers as you can see here reflected of below 20 and allow room for growth.

660
01:13:29,075 --> 01:13:33,937
[SPEAKER_09]: So that especially in students, that's like the older part of elementary school.

661
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:36,679
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're talking about rising third graders and rising fourth graders.

662
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:42,842
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have with 17 or 19 per classroom, some wiggle room for students to move in.

663
01:13:43,362 --> 01:13:45,343
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do feel at this moment that

664
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,586
[SPEAKER_09]: That's kind of a safe bet for consolidation.

665
01:13:48,986 --> 01:14:03,699
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I do want to say as I started out these are the current numbers, right now, as I received from Kim miles, we are constantly getting enrollments through our parent information center, our registration, I am in constant communication with.

666
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:27,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Teixeira about not only enrollment numbers, but what it is doing in terms of like some of his classrooms and populations, as well as ironically, the two buildings that I'm speaking to you tonight about in terms of consolidating also are the two that he's looking at in terms of the newcomer strands.

667
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:33,138
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it would allow a little bit of room to be able to have the space for that.

668
01:14:34,527 --> 01:14:50,176
[SPEAKER_09]: If you notice a little bit, if you look to the Missituck, I did kind of shade the first grade, the current first grade right now, a little lighter gray, because this is one of those classrooms we're gonna keep an eye on very closely.

669
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:58,541
[SPEAKER_09]: At the Missituck, currently right now, they have three sections in grades one through four.

670
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:16,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently their fifth grade has four sections but they're moving on to middle school, and their kindergarten has four sections that will roll up to first grade next year and so they will have four sections, but this rising first grade which will be second graders next year.

671
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:27,569
[SPEAKER_09]: If we were to consolidate this from three strands to two, as you can see here, we would start the school year right now with 21 to 22 students.

672
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:33,273
[SPEAKER_09]: That does not give us a lot of wiggle room in terms of growth over the summer.

673
01:15:33,913 --> 01:15:43,162
[SPEAKER_09]: So in terms of priority, this is the one classroom that we just may feel it's better to keep at three strands and not consolidate.

674
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:54,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas if you look at their current fourth grade numbers, which are rising fifth graders, they only have about 12 students in a class, only 37 total.

675
01:15:54,372 --> 01:15:58,896
[SPEAKER_09]: So consolidating from three to two seems to make some sense.

676
01:16:00,037 --> 01:16:00,978
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can ask a question.

677
01:16:00,998 --> 01:16:04,041
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to pause here for any questions.

678
01:16:04,962 --> 01:16:05,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

679
01:16:06,344 --> 01:16:09,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't remember starting this low at the beginning of the year.

680
01:16:09,687 --> 01:16:12,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this due to people moving out of district?

681
01:16:13,907 --> 01:16:19,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that for the grade levels, some of it is movement for sure.

682
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:26,056
[SPEAKER_09]: But in these four that I've highlighted here, there has been a little decline, but not much.

683
01:16:26,276 --> 01:16:29,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be honest that we did start on the low end.

684
01:16:29,538 --> 01:16:34,822
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you recall, when we started the school year, we were still in full COVID protocols.

685
01:16:35,042 --> 01:16:36,603
[SPEAKER_09]: We were still doing distancing.

686
01:16:38,144 --> 01:16:42,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had a lot of those safety protocols in place that we just felt it was prudent to kind of

687
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:51,117
[SPEAKER_09]: try to ensure as much, as much spacing as we could for students in classrooms and not really knowing how we were going to transition back.

688
01:16:51,237 --> 01:16:53,018
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a little bit of both.

689
01:16:55,158 --> 01:17:01,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just add one point that we also had some ballooning classrooms elsewhere in the district that led to us.

690
01:17:01,919 --> 01:17:11,781
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't, we just weren't in a position, um, giving that uncertainty, um, to, to consider pieces like this in August, but, um,

691
01:17:12,275 --> 01:17:26,046
[SPEAKER_05]: we are one of the assumptions, and we're not assuming this in every respect, but one of the assumptions that a number of our priorities rest on is a continuation of the progression toward normalcy.

692
01:17:26,787 --> 01:17:38,917
[SPEAKER_05]: And so assuming that continues to be the case, we should be in a position where we can make some more informed, thoughtful decisions that were not available to us

693
01:17:39,427 --> 01:17:43,729
[SPEAKER_05]: when we were more in the throes of the pandemic, if that makes sense.

694
01:17:45,589 --> 01:17:45,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

695
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:47,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

696
01:17:49,991 --> 01:17:50,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mayor.

697
01:17:51,952 --> 01:17:52,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Ms.

698
01:17:52,392 --> 01:17:52,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Glucy.

699
01:17:53,152 --> 01:17:58,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed, or maybe you were saying that it was not on here, so forgive me if I'm asking something that you said.

700
01:17:59,514 --> 01:18:02,295
[SPEAKER_04]: But what did you say about the MEEP classrooms?

701
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:08,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I just was questioning this because I know that I've been told anyway that there's a substantial waiting list for the

702
01:18:09,549 --> 01:18:26,215
[SPEAKER_04]: the preschool classrooms and especially the integrated, which has been a model for inclusion in our district specifically because it is a healthy mix of students with and without disabilities and has had a waiting list for some time.

703
01:18:26,275 --> 01:18:31,296
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering if that's being addressed or did you say that in a different sheet or something?

704
01:18:31,316 --> 01:18:33,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not quite sure what, I missed something, sorry.

705
01:18:34,517 --> 01:18:42,343
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just making sure that people knew the numbers that were reflected in the previous screen were just for general education classrooms, K to four.

706
01:18:42,963 --> 01:18:46,446
[SPEAKER_09]: What I wanted people to know is that it does not reflect total enrollment.

707
01:18:46,766 --> 01:18:52,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was absent the newcomer classrooms, special education programming and MEEP classrooms.

708
01:18:52,831 --> 01:19:02,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did just go through how many MEEP classrooms there are in each building, but I did not speak about a waiting list.

709
01:19:03,745 --> 01:19:04,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

710
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:10,329
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's absent special education, MEEP, and did you say the newcomers?

711
01:19:10,729 --> 01:19:11,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

712
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:15,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is just because you were talking about specifically consolidation?

713
01:19:16,233 --> 01:19:16,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

714
01:19:17,453 --> 01:19:23,917
[SPEAKER_09]: And this, what I'm speaking about right now does not affect those three programs whatsoever.

715
01:19:26,879 --> 01:19:27,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

716
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And will there be numbers?

717
01:19:30,821 --> 01:19:33,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know that I think yesterday we got some numbers around

718
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:40,241
[SPEAKER_04]: school enrollment for each of the schools, particularly, and I know last year that was definitely part of the budget book.

719
01:19:40,861 --> 01:19:48,707
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm assuming those numbers will include the MEEP special ed and newcomers programs when they're presented, is that right, Mr. Murphy or Ms.

720
01:19:49,307 --> 01:19:49,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Galussi?

721
01:19:50,328 --> 01:19:50,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

722
01:19:51,929 --> 01:19:52,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

723
01:19:52,790 --> 01:19:58,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there'll be another opportunity, I would assume, to ask about the MEEP program?

724
01:19:59,575 --> 01:20:00,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Murphy?

725
01:20:00,115 --> 01:20:01,376
[SPEAKER_02]: There certainly can be.

726
01:20:01,776 --> 01:20:02,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

727
01:20:07,157 --> 01:20:13,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, before I move on, I just didn't know if there were any other questions about the enrollment or possible strand consolidation.

728
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:15,915
[SPEAKER_03]: No other questions right now.

729
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

730
01:20:18,015 --> 01:20:18,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

731
01:20:18,555 --> 01:20:20,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite sure if I have been, oh, I do.

732
01:20:20,217 --> 01:20:23,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so moving on and staying in the elementary land.

733
01:20:24,961 --> 01:20:34,609
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that I just want to make sure people are aware with is we would like to continue our partnership with Hill for Literacy that we have gotten so much benefit out of this year.

734
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:42,836
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, I've reported several times about our commitment to the ECRI program and our very beneficial partnership with Hill for Literacy.

735
01:20:44,869 --> 01:21:00,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the wonderful pleasure of working with Eleni Stedman, who's one of our consultants through Hill for Literacy, two weeks ago, as we sat and really planned the literacy plan for next year, school year 22-23.

736
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:10,047
[SPEAKER_09]: So the priority goals for our literacy plan at the elementary level next year is going to be around leadership, instruction, professional development, and assessment.

737
01:21:10,807 --> 01:21:26,173
[SPEAKER_09]: And what that means is basically we're continuing with every so for the teachers that have had the full year of that it will be just the maintenance and maintaining every routines for any new staff that's coming on board we're going to make sure that they have the full training.

738
01:21:26,653 --> 01:21:27,893
[SPEAKER_09]: and there's implementation.

739
01:21:28,393 --> 01:21:48,097
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also going to expand the ECRI to include grade three staff because we know that our rising second graders are going to come in with that skill set and we need to now make sure our third grade teachers are versed in the methodology and the instructional, the explicit instruction of teaching practices.

740
01:21:48,557 --> 01:21:51,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're also going to loop in our tier two staff.

741
01:21:51,377 --> 01:21:55,698
[SPEAKER_09]: That has started a little bit here at the end of the year, but for our,

742
01:21:56,398 --> 01:22:03,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Title I reading interventionists and EL staff, they're going to be brought into the loop of the professional development.

743
01:22:04,635 --> 01:22:15,124
[SPEAKER_09]: We also one of the things that health literacy is grounded in and the Department of Education is grounded in is the science of reading methodology and pedagogy so.

744
01:22:15,824 --> 01:22:21,329
[SPEAKER_09]: So much so that the Department of Education is also in the middle of creating an mtel.

745
01:22:22,069 --> 01:22:26,473
[SPEAKER_09]: To make sure that college candidates and anyone entering the education field at the elementary level.

746
01:22:28,074 --> 01:22:30,955
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to be versed in this methodology for teaching reading.

747
01:22:31,515 --> 01:22:35,337
[SPEAKER_09]: So Hill for Literacy provides a science of reading course.

748
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:37,077
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a 10 month course.

749
01:22:38,278 --> 01:22:43,159
[SPEAKER_09]: They have two strands of it for K to two staff, and then one for grades three to five staff.

750
01:22:43,799 --> 01:22:49,001
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be an offering for all of our elementary staff, including administrators.

751
01:22:50,690 --> 01:23:08,083
[SPEAKER_09]: The other piece they're going to help and assist with is leadership meetings, so that we're working with our school leaders on the ECRI program, explicit instruction, proper and most beneficial effective use of our CPTs and wind blocks, and differentiation techniques with our staff.

752
01:23:09,124 --> 01:23:22,988
[SPEAKER_09]: We also are still, Dr. Chiesa and I are still in the process of meeting with HILFA literacy, but we would like to utilize their expertise in assisting us with a curriculum core review process.

753
01:23:23,328 --> 01:23:33,251
[SPEAKER_09]: This is also best practice for DESE in terms of the best manner in which to select our next English language arts curriculum.

754
01:23:33,971 --> 01:23:35,252
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not through a traditional

755
01:23:36,448 --> 01:23:44,633
[SPEAKER_09]: pilot process, it's using this Hill for Literacy in a consultancy manner to complete a core review process.

756
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:53,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Once I have more specifics on that, Dr. Keyes and I will definitely be presenting to this body, but we're still kind of working out the logistics of that.

757
01:23:55,039 --> 01:24:02,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite sure if there were any questions on that one, but... Before we do questions, can I just point out that

758
01:24:02,722 --> 01:24:09,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this has not been articulated yet with a specific budgetary number associated with it in any of your previous presentations.

759
01:24:09,587 --> 01:24:20,414
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were looking for that, um, You can stop because, uh, because of some of those ongoing discussions that miss Colusa just, uh, referred to, um, this is a critical strategic priority.

760
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:25,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that will definitely be included in the superintendent's recommendation, whether it's operating budget or Essar.

761
01:24:26,178 --> 01:24:29,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but we're still, we're still finalizing some of the specifics.

762
01:24:29,721 --> 01:24:30,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So as to avoid, um,

763
01:24:32,368 --> 01:24:33,569
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially having a question mark.

764
01:24:34,589 --> 01:24:41,133
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't actually put a projection into that, but it's something that is a continuation, as Ms.

765
01:24:41,153 --> 01:24:51,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Galistini stated, potential expansion, but one that will definitely be a critical priority and that we'll be emphasizing for the next fiscal year.

766
01:24:51,978 --> 01:24:59,762
[SPEAKER_05]: But I didn't want to, if anyone's wondering where the financial estimate associated with this was, I didn't want you to spend too much time

767
01:25:00,651 --> 01:25:03,613
[SPEAKER_05]: sifting through the deck to look for it.

768
01:25:03,633 --> 01:25:04,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

769
01:25:05,493 --> 01:25:05,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

770
01:25:06,934 --> 01:25:09,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Were there any questions on this before I move to the next slide?

771
01:25:13,257 --> 01:25:14,317
[SPEAKER_03]: No questions right now.

772
01:25:14,778 --> 01:25:14,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

773
01:25:14,918 --> 01:25:15,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let you know.

774
01:25:15,927 --> 01:25:16,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

775
01:25:16,447 --> 01:25:37,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And last for me is with our continued commitment to the implementation and full adoption of the responsive classroom program in all of the elementary schools, we're at the phase now we have provided ongoing and continuous professional development at staff meetings and both at the district level.

776
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:42,662
[SPEAKER_09]: As a matter of fact, they're gonna be finishing up this month with a three-part series

777
01:25:43,502 --> 01:25:45,804
[SPEAKER_09]: at the district level about leadership and language.

778
01:25:46,885 --> 01:26:08,603
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the next piece would be a lead teacher role at the elementary level so that an educator who is fully certified with responsive classroom to coordinate with myself, as well as offer support and assistance to the responsive classroom support teams at each building so that we can just maintain and sustain

779
01:26:10,068 --> 01:26:15,413
[SPEAKER_09]: the ongoing professional development and support for our staff and our teachers.

780
01:26:16,013 --> 01:26:28,304
[SPEAKER_09]: It would also, this person would also be tasked with maintaining their own certification with responsive classroom to ensure that we are compliant and that we are current with best practices.

781
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:32,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And they would also create and provide district-wide

782
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:42,933
[SPEAKER_09]: professional development, both in the, through the mentor program, as well as the initiation program for all new staff at the beginning of the year and ongoing throughout the year.

783
01:26:44,794 --> 01:26:48,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, currently, there are some lead teacher roles at the secondary level.

784
01:26:48,276 --> 01:26:51,398
[SPEAKER_09]: We really don't have many lead teacher roles at the elementary level.

785
01:26:52,318 --> 01:27:01,123
[SPEAKER_09]: We are continuing with our CPT coordinator role that has already been in place, but I think this one would be very beneficial to our ongoing work and commitment to responsive classroom.

786
01:27:05,178 --> 01:27:06,679
[SPEAKER_02]: if there are any questions on that.

787
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:08,120
I said I couldn't.

788
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:08,561
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

789
01:27:08,661 --> 01:27:29,977
[SPEAKER_05]: And so just staying on the topic of professional learning and the objectives that will be included in our FY23, again, many of which continuation of some of the investments we've made in FY22, I'm going to ask Dr. Cushing to speak a little bit about both secondary and district-wide professional learning opportunities.

790
01:27:30,457 --> 01:27:34,961
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to point out, and this was in the superintendent's communication on Friday, that

791
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:46,565
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a structural change going into effect next year with regard to the first week of school under a tentative agreement that we have as part of our negotiations with the Teachers Association.

792
01:27:47,385 --> 01:27:56,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Students will be returning on the Wednesday of the first week of school rather than the Tuesday, which has been the tradition in Medford.

793
01:27:57,768 --> 01:28:01,728
[SPEAKER_05]: That will be an announcement that will be made year in and year out.

794
01:28:02,108 --> 01:28:03,649
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not the case that

795
01:28:05,327 --> 01:28:06,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Students will always begin on the Wednesday.

796
01:28:07,028 --> 01:28:10,069
[SPEAKER_05]: They could still begin on the Tuesday of the first week of school.

797
01:28:10,109 --> 01:28:12,610
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the, again, this is the week before Labor Day.

798
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:28,636
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the 22, 23 school year, students will be returning on the Wednesday, which will give us the opportunity for additional professional development and meetings that will take place during those first two days, which Dr. Cushing is now going to share some of our objectives related to that.

799
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:29,616
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

800
01:28:30,175 --> 01:28:30,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

801
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:31,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr Murphy.

802
01:28:31,216 --> 01:28:32,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

803
01:28:32,898 --> 01:28:35,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for this opportunity to present this evening.

804
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:48,174
[SPEAKER_08]: So the additional PD for the that day for the first week, our initial plan is to really focus at the elementary level on devil's tier two and tier three teachers.

805
01:28:49,235 --> 01:28:52,739
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for other elementary teachers, we're launching the investigations

806
01:28:53,490 --> 01:29:00,251
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, three, um, professional development and program in the elementary school for our new math curriculum.

807
01:29:00,771 --> 01:29:07,653
[SPEAKER_08]: So the pedagogy, uh, will be delivered by Turk, which is the, um, authors of investigations three.

808
01:29:07,753 --> 01:29:10,773
[SPEAKER_08]: So they will be here assisting our educators.

809
01:29:11,493 --> 01:29:17,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, a initiative that we're currently working through right now for the middle school is responsive classroom.

810
01:29:17,615 --> 01:29:19,995
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking to have 30 educators trained.

811
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:33,970
[SPEAKER_08]: in responsive classrooms so they can be ambassadors in their school to help their peers move forward with the language and understanding that now all elementary students are rising to sixth grade with.

812
01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:40,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So responsive classroom has been expanded across the district to every elementary school.

813
01:29:40,293 --> 01:29:44,895
[SPEAKER_08]: The students now have that language and those understandings about the responsive classroom model

814
01:29:45,415 --> 01:29:56,821
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for them just to come to middle school and not be able to engage effectively with staff who don't have an understanding of responsive classroom seems like a tremendous waste of resources.

815
01:29:57,101 --> 01:30:06,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're planning to invest in responsive classroom work this summer and then to spend a significant amount of time throughout the year

816
01:30:07,987 --> 01:30:08,327
[SPEAKER_08]: on this.

817
01:30:09,307 --> 01:30:27,932
[SPEAKER_08]: High school, we're right now as part of the hate crimes grant, we have both middle and high school staff working on restorative justice, and we will be looking to have our high school staff, expand that out through the through that first day of school as well.

818
01:30:29,858 --> 01:30:39,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, with the tentative agreement, the November PD day will remain this year under our initial conversations as a leadership team.

819
01:30:40,142 --> 01:30:52,507
[SPEAKER_08]: We had conversations about possibly January or March, but given the amount of work that needs to be done on curriculum and social emotional learning, as well as our continued focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, DEI,

820
01:30:54,472 --> 01:31:00,405
[SPEAKER_08]: We felt that for this first year, it would be critical to bring our staff together early in the year.

821
01:31:01,813 --> 01:31:14,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Then for the remainder of the half day PD sessions, we do have a PD committee in partnership with our teachers association that provides an advisory capacity for us.

822
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:19,766
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now they're working diligently going through a survey that was put out to staff.

823
01:31:20,827 --> 01:31:24,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we wanna make sure that we take a good hard look at that.

824
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:28,153
[SPEAKER_08]: But some of the things that we've had initial conversations on

825
01:31:29,234 --> 01:31:51,471
[SPEAKER_08]: are really the curriculum focus, team teaching models, diversity, equity, inclusion work, and social-emotional learning, how to really make the SEL work have traction with our students so that it truly engages them in a way that gets them back to learning as quickly as possible, and classroom practices that support students who

826
01:31:52,572 --> 01:31:56,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be honest, many people have been traumatized by the last two years.

827
01:31:57,154 --> 01:32:02,996
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not lost on the fact that our students have been traumatized and have been through a tremendous amount.

828
01:32:03,516 --> 01:32:14,039
[SPEAKER_08]: And so how can we mitigate those traumas and those social emotional assaults that they've been through to get them back to learning as quickly as possible?

829
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I move, are there any questions or Ms.

830
01:32:18,161 --> 01:32:21,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Galussi, would you like to add anything before I move on to the next slides?

831
01:32:23,795 --> 01:32:25,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Not right now, unless someone has a question specifically.

832
01:32:30,741 --> 01:32:31,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Mayor?

833
01:32:33,663 --> 01:32:34,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

834
01:32:34,103 --> 01:32:34,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

835
01:32:34,323 --> 01:32:52,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Pelosi, I thought that, and maybe this is just my, I guess I'm just surprised to see that we're investing in professional development around dibbles, given that we are extensively testing kids with MAP and

836
01:32:53,824 --> 01:32:56,087
[SPEAKER_12]: MCAS and everything else.

837
01:32:56,107 --> 01:33:01,472
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess I'm just trying to understand like where dibbles fits in and is it based on the science of reading?

838
01:33:01,492 --> 01:33:08,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Like we've got all these things happening and like, when is too much assessment too much?

839
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,382
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess is my question.

840
01:33:10,930 --> 01:33:13,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, that's a great question.

841
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:28,378
[SPEAKER_09]: So, when it says tier two and tier three, that is not for classroom teachers, that will be for like the reading specialists that fall under me, and maybe some of Joan Bowen staff so in this science of reading shift.

842
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:46,108
[SPEAKER_09]: What is happening is that a lot of the teachers, a while ago, it's been baby steps to kind of make this shift and so one of the pieces that teachers were utilizing as part of their like triangulated assessment with students was FMP and DRAs.

843
01:33:47,057 --> 01:33:57,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are not really best practice anymore and don't really get at the specifics of how we can really help students with their reading needs.

844
01:33:57,884 --> 01:34:03,047
[SPEAKER_09]: And so DIBLS has both the phonological piece as well as a comprehension piece.

845
01:34:03,707 --> 01:34:07,330
[SPEAKER_09]: This is training that we are utilizing Hill for Literacy.

846
01:34:09,062 --> 01:34:15,825
[SPEAKER_09]: to conduct with teachers tier two so that they have a similar profile to what the teachers are using.

847
01:34:15,865 --> 01:34:19,047
[SPEAKER_09]: It is just for tier two and tier three staff.

848
01:34:20,748 --> 01:34:21,048
[SPEAKER_12]: Got it.

849
01:34:21,708 --> 01:34:30,092
[SPEAKER_12]: And have we explicitly outlawed the use of the tools that do not support things yet?

850
01:34:31,052 --> 01:34:32,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Or when do we plan to do that yet?

851
01:34:34,229 --> 01:34:36,931
[SPEAKER_09]: When I got here, it's been kind of like a slow decline.

852
01:34:36,991 --> 01:34:43,517
[SPEAKER_09]: So this year, teachers are aware that it's no longer utilized.

853
01:34:44,137 --> 01:34:50,123
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the year we've shifted to map and we're trying to build in so that there are multiple measures.

854
01:34:50,483 --> 01:34:58,410
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't wanna over test students, but we also don't, it's very important that we're not informing our instruction based on like one data set.

855
01:35:00,511 --> 01:35:15,125
[SPEAKER_09]: if that makes sense, but we are not, it has been communicated through my elementary updates to staff that DRA and Fountas & Pinnell are really no longer part of the science of reading alignment.

856
01:35:16,006 --> 01:35:19,409
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those are phasing out, which is why we're bringing the DIBLs in.

857
01:35:22,352 --> 01:35:22,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

858
01:35:22,813 --> 01:35:23,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

859
01:35:23,814 --> 01:35:24,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

860
01:35:24,254 --> 01:35:24,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin.

861
01:35:25,889 --> 01:35:27,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, thank you.

862
01:35:27,230 --> 01:35:39,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to say that if you guys, that was very helpful because I understand the language that you guys were all speaking, but if anybody was listening to that and didn't know this language, it seriously sounds like a foreign language.

863
01:35:39,803 --> 01:35:43,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just am again asking that that be pointed out just a little bit.

864
01:35:43,767 --> 01:35:44,128
[SPEAKER_04]: And so

865
01:35:45,972 --> 01:36:10,632
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if I could translate or if somebody else wants to translate essentially what you're talking about here is professional development for literacy, for reading skills, and that there are tools that are used by educators called things like DIBLS, FONTAS, and PINAL, DRA, those are all assessment tools for reading or have been previously used assessment tools for reading, right?

866
01:36:10,813 --> 01:36:13,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Or perhaps you could do just a little bit of a,

867
01:36:14,155 --> 01:36:21,260
[SPEAKER_04]: a concise sort of summary of what you just said that would sort of be the equivalent of a translation for the layperson, if you wouldn't mind.

868
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:22,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

869
01:36:22,561 --> 01:36:31,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's so previously classroom teachers for grades K through three were given the developmental reading assessment.

870
01:36:31,146 --> 01:36:39,932
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a tool, as member McLaughlin just said, that people that teachers utilized to assess a student's reading ability.

871
01:36:41,145 --> 01:36:48,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Grades four through five, as well as tier two reading staff, utilize the Fountas and Pinnell reading assessment system.

872
01:36:49,268 --> 01:37:03,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Both of those systems, especially DRA, no longer fit the new best practice around explicit reading instruction, which falls in line with the science of reading methodology that the Department of Education

873
01:37:07,116 --> 01:37:20,060
[SPEAKER_09]: endorses it all also dovetails into their requirement for us to have a K to two screening reading screener for all of our students that is a statewide mandate.

874
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:27,643
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, both the Fountas and Pennell, and the DRA no longer meet the requirements of getting to the explicit

875
01:37:28,612 --> 01:37:38,674
[SPEAKER_09]: components of a child's reading development to help us really put in the supports that we need to move that student's reading to another level.

876
01:37:39,014 --> 01:37:50,757
[SPEAKER_09]: The DIBLs will do that, which is why we're going to train some tier two and tier three staff in that program as we shift away from the other two that are really no longer supported for best practices.

877
01:37:52,377 --> 01:37:52,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Well done.

878
01:37:52,858 --> 01:37:53,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

879
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:02,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're still on Dr. Cushing and professional learning objectives.

880
01:38:03,867 --> 01:38:04,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me one second.

881
01:38:05,848 --> 01:38:06,548
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

882
01:38:06,568 --> 01:38:09,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Go.

883
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:13,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate that one.

884
01:38:15,812 --> 01:38:25,556
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so as we move forward,

885
01:38:28,329 --> 01:38:36,998
[SPEAKER_08]: So you'll see here our priorities for professional development and the scale in the far right hand column.

886
01:38:37,598 --> 01:38:40,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So first DIBLS included in the Hill for Literacy.

887
01:38:40,841 --> 01:38:46,327
[SPEAKER_08]: DIBLS are measures that help teachers and schools determine how students are performing on important reading skills.

888
01:38:46,939 --> 01:38:51,601
[SPEAKER_08]: DIVL stands for Dynamic Indicators of Basic Learning Early Literacy Skills.

889
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:58,783
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not gonna read everything to you, but I did feel it was important so that you all got the DIVL's acronym out there.

890
01:38:59,924 --> 01:39:03,225
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but this was just addressed, DEI work.

891
01:39:04,225 --> 01:39:06,346
[SPEAKER_08]: This represents an increase of about $5,000 to hopefully increase

892
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:25,204
[SPEAKER_08]: include stipends for teacher leaders as we continue our DEI work with some of our in-district trainers and other opportunities for our staff to learn from one another.

893
01:39:26,546 --> 01:39:29,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Investigations, math implementation, professional development,

894
01:39:30,978 --> 01:39:39,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking at about $30,000 to $50,000, this is a new expense, but this is a program that's been adopted by the district and needs to be implemented with fidelity.

895
01:39:40,146 --> 01:39:46,012
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need to really invest to make sure that we're building the capacity of our educators around this critical math program.

896
01:39:47,638 --> 01:39:53,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Then moving forward, looking at our mentoring, induction, and ongoing support.

897
01:39:54,502 --> 01:40:13,334
[SPEAKER_08]: This will be a train-the-trainer model to really help support our pre-service teachers as looking at teaching all learners, looking at UDL, differentiated instruction, SEL, and a great other things, including, and most importantly,

898
01:40:13,807 --> 01:40:18,832
[SPEAKER_08]: engaging parents and guardians to be partners with us.

899
01:40:18,852 --> 01:40:21,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Then responsive classroom for middle school, $61,000.

900
01:40:22,054 --> 01:40:26,979
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an investment to continue the program that is now at all the elementary schools.

901
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:33,305
[SPEAKER_08]: This is about a 50-50 split between training and stipends for our staff over the summer.

902
01:40:34,609 --> 01:40:37,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have restorative justice for high school.

903
01:40:37,192 --> 01:40:49,722
[SPEAKER_08]: These are stipends for the staff right now, as I mentioned earlier, we have between 30 and 40 staff who are going through the training that is being funded by the hate crimes prevention grant.

904
01:40:50,603 --> 01:40:52,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be about $7800 to be able to support the.

905
01:40:57,548 --> 01:41:01,431
[SPEAKER_08]: the professional development work that we would hope our teachers would be able to do.

906
01:41:01,491 --> 01:41:17,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we also have the PD Collaborative, a Salem State consortium that allows courses that are either free or discounted for teachers as they move through their certification renewal process or other courses that might be beneficial to our students.

907
01:41:18,304 --> 01:41:22,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of these courses might be $25 or $50 if there is a cost, but many are free.

908
01:41:26,915 --> 01:41:30,776
[SPEAKER_08]: And before we move to the next slide, I'll move back a slide, and Ms.

909
01:41:30,796 --> 01:41:34,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Galussi or any questions that members of the committee may have.

910
01:41:36,297 --> 01:41:36,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

911
01:41:36,437 --> 01:41:37,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Galussi, if you want to add anything.

912
01:41:39,798 --> 01:41:41,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good unless someone has a specific question.

913
01:41:41,859 --> 01:41:42,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

914
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:46,360
[SPEAKER_03]: All set.

915
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,740
[SPEAKER_03]: We can keep going, Dr. Cushing.

916
01:41:49,041 --> 01:41:50,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

917
01:41:50,121 --> 01:41:50,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

918
01:41:51,361 --> 01:41:51,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Galussi.

919
01:41:51,901 --> 01:41:54,342
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll transition now.

920
01:41:55,363 --> 01:42:06,506
[SPEAKER_05]: from our discussion of the professional development and professional learning goals that the organization will be committed to throughout FY23 to one of the fixed costs.

921
01:42:06,546 --> 01:42:12,147
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll remember that in the fixed cost slide number seven, we're estimating right now $155,000 in renewals.

922
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:12,887
[SPEAKER_05]: That's $155,000 increase with respect to

923
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:24,942
[SPEAKER_05]: renewals of various subscriptions and platforms and applications that the district is relying upon.

924
01:42:24,962 --> 01:42:31,725
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see, it's a quite extensive list of vendors and partners that the district works with.

925
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:34,226
[SPEAKER_05]: There is some variability here.

926
01:42:34,266 --> 01:42:47,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is another piece that we scrub on a daily basis to determine whether or not either through negotiations with the various entities or identification of potential efficiencies or consolidation.

927
01:42:48,568 --> 01:42:50,790
[SPEAKER_05]: that we can realize some savings in.

928
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:52,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now we're still projecting 155.

929
01:42:53,111 --> 01:43:00,135
[SPEAKER_05]: It is my hope that as we continue to work through that, we might be able to nudge that number down a little bit.

930
01:43:00,155 --> 01:43:06,478
[SPEAKER_05]: 155 on a $2.5 million fixed cost projection, obviously we can nudge it down.

931
01:43:06,519 --> 01:43:13,402
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to have a monumental impact, but still every dollar counts.

932
01:43:13,482 --> 01:43:16,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to the degree we're able to either shift costs around

933
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,201
[SPEAKER_05]: or pull costs down.

934
01:43:19,221 --> 01:43:21,541
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that we're eager to do.

935
01:43:23,102 --> 01:43:29,663
[SPEAKER_05]: There is, this is also, there may be other, some of the costs were charged to the ESSER fund last year.

936
01:43:29,683 --> 01:43:33,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these platforms were identified as part of our COVID recovery.

937
01:43:33,044 --> 01:43:40,086
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we navigated through the pandemic, that's how some of this list grew, frankly.

938
01:43:40,146 --> 01:43:46,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one of the pieces of work that we're doing is going through to determine whether or not there are any

939
01:43:47,005 --> 01:43:57,508
[SPEAKER_05]: vendors that we may be able to relinquish our partnership with on the basis that the need is not what it was during the pandemic itself.

940
01:43:58,508 --> 01:44:04,449
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a few examples of that already, but it is possible we'll be able to look for additional consolidations there.

941
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:07,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're ready to move on.

942
01:44:08,930 --> 01:44:15,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say as we get to our operations and maintenance, our line 41 in a budget book,

943
01:44:17,545 --> 01:44:22,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I should say, I hope Mr. McLaughlin's not on his call because he is currently celebrating his 25th wedding anniversary.

944
01:44:23,029 --> 01:44:33,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wish Mr. and Mrs. McLaughlin a happy anniversary and commend him for entrusting me to relay this information in his absence.

945
01:44:34,877 --> 01:44:42,062
[SPEAKER_05]: But most of these costs, frankly, are ones that have already been communicated to the committee previously with regard to the projected $200,000 increase in

946
01:44:44,727 --> 01:44:48,049
[SPEAKER_05]: and gas utilities and $25,000 in electricity.

947
01:44:49,550 --> 01:45:05,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are attributable in part to the number of systems in the high school that we've brought back online as part of our efforts to increase air quality, improve air quality rather, in the COVID era.

948
01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:11,243
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also just the case that the cost of utilities have gone up across the country.

949
01:45:12,385 --> 01:45:13,566
[SPEAKER_05]: We're experiencing that as well.

950
01:45:13,646 --> 01:45:24,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So previously, we had budgeted approximately half a million dollars for heating utilities.

951
01:45:25,112 --> 01:45:29,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And that we are projected right now to go over budget by approximately $200,000.

952
01:45:29,235 --> 01:45:39,621
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're gonna be able to absorb that in our budget through other savings, but for purposes of being prepared for next year, that's a number that we've included.

953
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:47,676
[SPEAKER_05]: We did increase, you may recall, in FY22 the overtime budget by $15,000 from 80 to 95.

954
01:45:48,096 --> 01:45:48,916
[SPEAKER_05]: We are $67,000 over.

955
01:45:48,956 --> 01:45:54,617
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a return to a number of events, which is a good thing.

956
01:45:55,117 --> 01:45:59,738
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is also something that we know in FY23 we're going to need to scrutinize more closely.

957
01:46:00,158 --> 01:46:07,020
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not recommending an increase in spite of $67,000 and counting in the overtime line.

958
01:46:07,895 --> 01:46:13,660
[SPEAKER_05]: but it is something that we're going to monitor very closely in FY23 to see if there are some efficiencies we can identify there.

959
01:46:15,122 --> 01:46:25,470
[SPEAKER_05]: From a structural perspective, going with the theme of the evening, we are looking at and in conversations with the procurement office about returning to vendor agreements.

960
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:30,054
[SPEAKER_05]: These are essentially retainers that we would keep some of our vendors that we work with more frequently.

961
01:46:30,655 --> 01:46:34,098
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a best practice that Medford had, as I understand it, followed several years ago.

962
01:46:34,663 --> 01:46:44,691
[SPEAKER_05]: it's unclear exactly why that practice discontinued, but it's something that we're working toward rectifying in FY23.

963
01:46:44,811 --> 01:47:01,645
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the, again, another piece that we have discussed in the past, and again, whenever we get into the buildings and grounds component of the budget, it's the case that there are priorities that we wanna identify to make sure that the school committee and the community is aware of going into the fiscal year.

964
01:47:02,155 --> 01:47:11,482
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are a number that we would recommend not being addressed via the operating budget, but rather via the capital repairs line item that's still available to us.

965
01:47:12,263 --> 01:47:29,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And those, which is what I would recommend, it references it here, but what I'd like to do is in June, in one of the June meetings, to present a more comprehensive list of FY23 capital priorities that the district would recommend with its remaining capital repairs

966
01:47:31,096 --> 01:47:33,598
[SPEAKER_05]: fund that was appropriated to us in August of 2020.

967
01:47:34,038 --> 01:47:40,202
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that list will be some of the ones that we've discussed before.

968
01:47:40,222 --> 01:47:47,826
[SPEAKER_05]: The McGlynn classroom leaks, which we have a temporary solution to right now, but we're anticipating a potentially more significant repair.

969
01:47:48,507 --> 01:47:52,109
[SPEAKER_05]: And that price has fluctuated as we've investigated it.

970
01:47:52,189 --> 01:47:57,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the reason we haven't brought that to you yet, is we're just working to nail that down.

971
01:47:58,124 --> 01:48:14,558
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the high school restroom issue, which I know the committee has weighed in on this previously, but in the context of hopefully a long-term plan coming together for this facility through our MSBA application, that's something that the administration will be seeking guidance from the committee on.

972
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:24,427
[SPEAKER_05]: The generator is something that, because of some other infrastructure work we did, we've been able to punt on that for a few months, but it does need to be addressed in the near future.

973
01:48:24,827 --> 01:48:30,690
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have an issue with the breezeway flooring in the high school that I know students and staff are very familiar with.

974
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:44,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I don't anticipate that we'll be presenting to you an extensive list on an annual basis of capital repairs, at least for while we continue to advocate for a more comprehensive solution to our flagship school and those challenges.

975
01:48:45,778 --> 01:48:53,002
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some issues that we'll just need to address to make sure that our students and staff are in a building that is meeting

976
01:48:54,142 --> 01:48:54,722
[SPEAKER_05]: our standards.

977
01:48:56,283 --> 01:48:59,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And the deteriorating floor and the breezeway at the high school is one of them.

978
01:49:00,024 --> 01:49:05,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that that is something that I would anticipate we may be seeking to address in the very near future.

979
01:49:07,387 --> 01:49:12,149
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting close to the end of any new information that we're presenting you with tonight.

980
01:49:12,249 --> 01:49:18,311
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna, if it's okay, Mayor, and this is the last time I'll ask before the end of the presentation, but there's only two slides left.

981
01:49:18,391 --> 01:49:22,373
[SPEAKER_05]: So are there any questions either on subscription renewals or

982
01:49:23,004 --> 01:49:24,164
[SPEAKER_05]: on the buildings and grounds piece.

983
01:49:27,485 --> 01:49:28,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Very thorough.

984
01:49:28,125 --> 01:49:28,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

985
01:49:28,965 --> 01:49:29,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

986
01:49:29,606 --> 01:49:40,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, as we go, I said that based on the fluctuations between issues that would be addressed in the capital budget or some other fluctuations that we're looking, we didn't adjust those total numbers.

987
01:49:40,848 --> 01:49:48,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the next time we present to you on Monday, we will present the different variations that will include numbers that

988
01:49:48,926 --> 01:49:57,971
[SPEAKER_05]: in all likelihood will exceed the recommendation that the school committee will receive, but will be representative of all the priorities, the cumulative priorities, essentially.

989
01:49:59,952 --> 01:50:13,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after some discussion, it would be my hope that by the end of next week, we could convene so that the committee could formally make that request that would then go to the municipal government

990
01:50:14,241 --> 01:50:15,762
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the end of the budget process.

991
01:50:15,963 --> 01:50:23,650
[SPEAKER_05]: As everyone knows, as we discussed at the beginning of last night and tonight, the municipal government will then do its deliberations.

992
01:50:23,730 --> 01:50:25,651
[SPEAKER_05]: There'll be a recommendation from the mayor to the city council.

993
01:50:25,671 --> 01:50:26,932
[SPEAKER_05]: City council will make appropriation.

994
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:30,696
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the school committee will reconvene to adopt an appropriation.

995
01:50:31,316 --> 01:50:36,461
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the midst of that, you'll have the opportunity to articulate other priorities or potential shifts.

996
01:50:36,821 --> 01:50:40,625
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll also have clarity with respect to what we'll be projecting onto the

997
01:50:41,349 --> 01:50:46,591
[SPEAKER_05]: ESSER grants and what will be continuing to be incorporated into the operating budget.

998
01:50:47,011 --> 01:51:02,397
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the last slide is pretty much the bullets that I've just said, other than just the goals for next week in terms of refining some of these projections, the categorization, and organizing that request to the school committee.

999
01:51:05,203 --> 01:51:17,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you have one question Mr Murphy member Graham, of course, yep, I think we take the slide down unless unless someone wants to reference it but that's the last slide so can you actually go back to the slide prior absolutely as I was saying we should keep the slide up.

1000
01:51:18,032 --> 01:51:21,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So people can refer to it, it's only fair.

1001
01:51:22,535 --> 01:51:24,276
[SPEAKER_12]: You are going to be wrong, no matter which way.

1002
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:46,255
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we talk about this again, can this slide be updated to include like, if we were talking about the spend of category C, D, E, F, like what would those numbers be so that we can be clear?

1003
01:51:46,395 --> 01:51:55,103
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think, you know, as we think about like the, what we're trying to send up in terms of our request,

1004
01:51:57,052 --> 01:52:16,654
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess I would like to personally spend some time just to understand if we're just talking about categories A and B in play here, there were a lot of things in those other categories that I think are strategically aligned and are meaningful, and how do we make sure

1005
01:52:17,671 --> 01:52:27,878
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, that those things don't get left on the cutting room floor in our request without a lot of thought.

1006
01:52:29,479 --> 01:52:30,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I will.

1007
01:52:30,500 --> 01:52:35,043
[SPEAKER_05]: The next version of this will spell out all those variations of that.

1008
01:52:35,943 --> 01:52:43,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that the categorization process, you know, there are changes in that as we go through and scrub things.

1009
01:52:44,556 --> 01:53:00,202
[SPEAKER_05]: what might have been a number associated with categories A, B, and C tonight might not be the case by the time you see it again, but they'll all be available because even if something gets shifted down, there isn't, if it's in this presentation, it's something that we think has value.

1010
01:53:00,722 --> 01:53:05,564
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a question of what is, how do we maximize the value in the context of everything else?

1011
01:53:06,164 --> 01:53:08,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are some examples of that.

1012
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:12,407
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't wanna, I can articulate them if you want, but there,

1013
01:53:12,987 --> 01:53:18,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to do anything to suggest that anything that made it in here we think in a vacuum is a bad idea.

1014
01:53:19,210 --> 01:53:23,272
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that the recommendation we don't think should be made in a vacuum.

1015
01:53:24,093 --> 01:53:26,454
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we're sort of working to assemble that.

1016
01:53:28,315 --> 01:53:30,596
[SPEAKER_05]: But you'll see all the different numbers and variations of it, yes.

1017
01:53:31,637 --> 01:53:41,522
[SPEAKER_12]: I would think the librarians at the elementary school would be a good example of something that couldn't succeed without the right supports structurally.

1018
01:53:44,645 --> 01:53:46,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I think that was my question.

1019
01:53:46,306 --> 01:54:08,340
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to make sure that it's really clear, you know, however the categories land, what are the collective impacts of the categories so that as a committee, we have an opportunity to agree, disagree, like move things around, et cetera, as we have that final discussion and send our request to the municipal government.

1020
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:09,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1021
01:54:10,381 --> 01:54:10,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1022
01:54:15,584 --> 01:54:15,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1023
01:54:16,825 --> 01:54:31,571
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm still in the process, part of it as well and so I'm looking for a little bit of clarification for what's expected for next week and also just having been through one budget process previously.

1024
01:54:34,142 --> 01:54:37,207
[SPEAKER_04]: On the school committee, although I know colleagues here.

1025
01:54:37,768 --> 01:54:47,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Some have been on more and some have been on last, and certainly community members, and with this being a new process this year I think it'd be helpful to have this laid out a little bit more so.

1026
01:54:48,682 --> 01:54:56,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Previously, we would have department heads come and present to us with their sort of previous budget from the year before, which we could see.

1027
01:54:57,046 --> 01:55:04,830
[SPEAKER_04]: And then any additional requests that they had that were sort of above and beyond their previous budget from the year ahead.

1028
01:55:05,431 --> 01:55:08,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we would have recommendations from the superintendent based on those things.

1029
01:55:09,353 --> 01:55:11,174
[SPEAKER_04]: That was sort of the previous process.

1030
01:55:11,714 --> 01:55:16,356
[SPEAKER_04]: And this process has been more about a grouping under categories of

1031
01:55:18,864 --> 01:55:42,961
[SPEAKER_04]: items that were aligned or are aligned with the superintendent and the approved school committee strategic plan, and then further categorized on this ABCD category, but not in the context of sort of the larger budget for the community seat, what the previous budget was departmentally.

1032
01:55:43,001 --> 01:55:45,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So no sort of comparison basis, if you will.

1033
01:55:45,571 --> 01:55:50,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously we as school committee members will get a budget book that has all that information but for the community.

1034
01:55:51,520 --> 01:56:01,054
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that look like, and what does it also look like for us for next week so I think through the chair what I understood member Graham saying was that, you know, again,

1035
01:56:02,024 --> 01:56:29,832
[SPEAKER_04]: in addition to not having things fall off the list that might not have been in the A, B category, that we're also not looking at things sort of in a vacuum, which I think is aligned with what I'm saying, but perhaps Mr. Murphy, you can spell this out a little bit better for me and for the community about what this will look like in terms of comparison to previous budget, proposed budget, sort of departmentally.

1036
01:56:29,872 --> 01:56:31,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we gonna see this in context?

1037
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:41,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so your budget book that I anticipate you receiving next week will essentially look like your previous budget book.

1038
01:56:42,724 --> 01:56:46,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, as we talked about a lot last year, it's not the final budget book.

1039
01:56:47,605 --> 01:56:48,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we take this slide down?

1040
01:56:48,786 --> 01:56:51,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, can we take this slide down just so we, thank you.

1041
01:56:51,067 --> 01:56:53,628
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't, but there we go.

1042
01:56:54,048 --> 01:56:54,608
[SPEAKER_05]: So the

1043
01:56:55,548 --> 01:57:02,490
[SPEAKER_05]: The budget book will look the same and we'll have the line items that will allow you to compare and contrast.

1044
01:57:04,310 --> 01:57:08,251
[SPEAKER_05]: This process is about understanding what those differences should be.

1045
01:57:09,191 --> 01:57:23,375
[SPEAKER_05]: And the hope is that through the feedback we've received and the conversation we've had over the past couple of nights that we'll have at the beginning of next week, we're able to give the school committee the sort of full context

1046
01:57:23,969 --> 01:57:31,193
[SPEAKER_05]: of all the competing priorities, and then assemble a recommendation as to how those things fit together.

1047
01:57:31,593 --> 01:57:43,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, the book is the book, and it will include the line items that you would be used to, but the changes would be reflective of our conversations.

1048
01:57:44,620 --> 01:57:45,361
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the purpose.

1049
01:57:45,681 --> 01:57:49,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is, and I know you've heard me say this before, it is unusual for

1050
01:57:53,412 --> 01:58:03,016
[SPEAKER_05]: the superintendent's recommendation to be preceded by the direct testimony of so many directors.

1051
01:58:03,676 --> 01:58:22,784
[SPEAKER_05]: And so with the adoption of the strategic plan, and I think the committee's stated preference to essentially establish a more efficient process, the goal is to be presenting information that is, and I'm not suggesting that it was completely incoherent with the previous process,

1052
01:58:23,309 --> 01:58:27,111
[SPEAKER_05]: But the goal is to have more coherency and less siloing.

1053
01:58:27,672 --> 01:58:39,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Because through the direct test, and as you know, the committee has the sort of raw data, and we've tried to, frankly, there are things in this, these presentations that I would also consider to be raw data.

1054
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:50,346
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanna sort of, we're trying to sort of retain the transparency, but with a added emphasis on coherency.

1055
01:58:52,357 --> 01:58:54,879
[SPEAKER_05]: My hope is that we've been successful in that.

1056
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:07,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think that will become clearer next week when we're able to articulate these sort of various, the sort of variations of this, and then we'll move toward the more traditional sort of like, here's the book, here's how much it adds up to.

1057
01:59:07,109 --> 01:59:21,320
[SPEAKER_05]: The only other caveat I would add to that is there's a variable around category B. There could be variables around the other categories as well, but remember the definition of category B in this process

1058
01:59:21,844 --> 01:59:33,130
[SPEAKER_05]: are things that in the administrations, from the administration's perspective, we really have to do, whether it's a compliance purpose or just best interests of students purposes, it's something that we have to do.

1059
01:59:33,230 --> 01:59:51,499
[SPEAKER_05]: In a vacuum, we'd love to have that in the operating budget, but recognizing that there are capacity issues there, we're saying, and that there's eligibility with the ESSER, we're saying that the ESSER in that instance is essentially an insurance policy so that we as an administration can plan to do it

1060
01:59:52,017 --> 01:59:54,478
[SPEAKER_05]: even though the funding on the operating side might not be available.

1061
01:59:55,258 --> 01:59:55,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1062
01:59:55,739 --> 01:59:58,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if I just might have a follow up on that mayor.

1063
02:00:02,221 --> 02:00:14,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we is the expectation or the anticipation that we will be voting on a number for next Monday's meeting?

1064
02:00:14,546 --> 02:00:15,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that I mean,

1065
02:00:17,568 --> 02:00:22,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would Monday, it seems like I mean, frankly, it's up to the committee.

1066
02:00:23,629 --> 02:00:27,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be inclined to say we should plan to send a request next week.

1067
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:30,910
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that necessarily has to be Monday.

1068
02:00:31,810 --> 02:00:41,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if we if we have if we've sort of fleshed out the discussion in a way that the committee feels frankly, it's possible that the committee will be ready, we'll certainly have all the numbers where you could.

1069
02:00:42,692 --> 02:00:47,093
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would if there's more sort of back and forth and deliberation next week, then

1070
02:00:47,701 --> 02:00:51,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I would expect it might be something we have to do later in the week.

1071
02:00:51,683 --> 02:00:51,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1072
02:00:52,003 --> 02:00:52,843
[SPEAKER_04]: And then thank you.

1073
02:00:52,963 --> 02:00:56,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And when are we anticipated, when is it anticipated that we'll be getting the budget books?

1074
02:00:57,365 --> 02:01:06,789
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're expecting, you know, some sort of vote next week and is the opportunity for public feedback essentially next week's meeting?

1075
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:07,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1076
02:01:08,009 --> 02:01:08,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1077
02:01:08,289 --> 02:01:09,310
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good question too.

1078
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:16,613
[SPEAKER_05]: So statutorily the committee should have one opportunity that is open to the public for people to comment.

1079
02:01:17,671 --> 02:01:24,836
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, frankly, given the totality of the information we've provided, I think we are, from a legal perspective, that could certainly be Monday.

1080
02:01:26,337 --> 02:01:34,442
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of committees, frankly, that they have the public hearing at six o'clock, and regardless of who shows up and what they say, they take the vote at seven o'clock.

1081
02:01:35,843 --> 02:01:41,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would make sense to have that opportunity on Monday to satisfy the statutory requirement.

1082
02:01:43,388 --> 02:01:43,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1083
02:01:46,513 --> 02:01:48,194
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did you say when we were getting the budget book?

1084
02:01:48,214 --> 02:01:49,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, did I get that answer?

1085
02:01:49,455 --> 02:01:52,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I would recommend we send them to you electronically next week.

1086
02:01:52,957 --> 02:01:56,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it is a draft in the sense that it's just based on your request.

1087
02:01:58,140 --> 02:02:05,005
[SPEAKER_05]: If the committee would like that, I would expect it to be by the end of next week, is what I would expect.

1088
02:02:06,586 --> 02:02:07,266
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, thank you.

1089
02:02:08,407 --> 02:02:09,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you guys just said, Ms.

1090
02:02:09,628 --> 02:02:12,429
[SPEAKER_05]: McLaughlin, when it's sent, it'll also be published publicly.

1091
02:02:12,490 --> 02:02:14,411
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a public document.

1092
02:02:15,836 --> 02:02:23,241
[SPEAKER_05]: for members of the community, they'll have the opportunity to visit the website and it'll be available there, as is all the other budget books over the course of the last however many years.

1093
02:02:24,863 --> 02:02:26,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Hayes, then Member Graham.

1094
02:02:29,466 --> 02:02:41,315
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm trying to put information together here from, so we got sent a spreadsheet that had requests from principals and things like that, and I'm wondering how

1095
02:02:42,502 --> 02:02:45,424
[SPEAKER_11]: how some of that information fits into these presentations.

1096
02:02:45,464 --> 02:02:54,211
[SPEAKER_11]: There were some pretty specific things about math specialists and I forget what else, but just some of those things.

1097
02:02:55,292 --> 02:03:03,999
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I missed some things because I was having some computer issues or how do those pieces come in and do we talk about those?

1098
02:03:04,579 --> 02:03:05,780
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm- Yeah, so thank you.

1099
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:06,621
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good question, Ms.

1100
02:03:06,801 --> 02:03:07,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Stacey.

1101
02:03:07,141 --> 02:03:11,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I mentioned, one of the things that is unusual in the traditional process in Medford

1102
02:03:12,056 --> 02:03:21,439
[SPEAKER_05]: is the idea of direct testimony from various staff members preceding the superintendent's recommendation and essentially preempting the superintendent's recommendation.

1103
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:40,326
[SPEAKER_05]: We've tried to balance that by providing that raw data from the survey information, understanding that administrators who I think did a great job being very thoughtful about providing the information that is a priority for their individual department or for their individual

1104
02:03:41,725 --> 02:03:51,211
[SPEAKER_05]: school, that there's a need for that to ultimately be developed into a coherent recommendation that is the superintendent's recommendation.

1105
02:03:51,271 --> 02:04:03,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we didn't want to completely, because I think that does provide for some great transparency and gives the school committee a sense as to what the superintendent and her team are looking at in terms of developing that recommendation.

1106
02:04:03,258 --> 02:04:09,601
[SPEAKER_05]: But ultimately, it's the superintendent's recommendation is really all that the school committee is authorized to vote on.

1107
02:04:10,788 --> 02:04:25,174
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd say authorized not in a sense that to limit the committee's authority, except that like, you know, post ed reform world, the sort of policy objective is to not have the school committee voting on individual principal or department head budgetary priorities.

1108
02:04:25,214 --> 02:04:33,097
[SPEAKER_05]: That ultimately that has to be, it's the superintendent's responsibility and her team to comb through all of that and ultimately present that information to the committee.

1109
02:04:33,157 --> 02:04:38,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are still frankly presenting more information than you would see in other communities.

1110
02:04:38,659 --> 02:04:39,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, that's because,

1111
02:04:40,877 --> 02:04:57,631
[SPEAKER_05]: we do think it sort of provides a level of transparency that can be helpful, but at the same time, we're trying to balance that with a greater emphasis on coherency to make sure that the committee understands based on the objectives of the strategic plan, what it is that the administration is actually recommending.

1112
02:04:58,651 --> 02:05:02,715
[SPEAKER_11]: So I didn't hear anything unless I missed it.

1113
02:05:02,775 --> 02:05:03,275
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1114
02:05:03,475 --> 02:05:05,557
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't hear anything about any of those supports.

1115
02:05:05,577 --> 02:05:09,280
[SPEAKER_11]: So does that mean those have not been included in this budget?

1116
02:05:09,702 --> 02:05:12,083
[SPEAKER_05]: with respect to which supports?

1117
02:05:12,123 --> 02:05:17,165
[SPEAKER_11]: There were, again, math coaches, math specialists.

1118
02:05:17,225 --> 02:05:19,186
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there might've been some reading specialists.

1119
02:05:19,866 --> 02:05:24,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so all of those happen, they are included, that they are referenced there.

1120
02:05:24,508 --> 02:05:31,651
[SPEAKER_05]: They are prioritized differently depending on where we think that fits in and the scope of the overall budgetary priorities.

1121
02:05:32,551 --> 02:05:37,053
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you go to the FY23 strategic priorities

1122
02:05:37,886 --> 02:05:41,447
[SPEAKER_05]: on the first page where the personnel information is, you'll see the bottom row.

1123
02:05:41,507 --> 02:05:43,648
[SPEAKER_05]: We did not necessarily talk about it.

1124
02:05:44,048 --> 02:05:52,331
[SPEAKER_05]: It is categorized as category E as it happens, but that is a 4.0 FTE for math interventionists.

1125
02:05:52,671 --> 02:06:06,856
[SPEAKER_05]: That is something we talked about last year when we were determining essentially what to charge the ESSER budget to, and the decision was made to go with four literacy interventionists at the elementary level as a way of trying to bridge that gap.

1126
02:06:08,090 --> 02:06:09,751
[SPEAKER_05]: based on where we were with respect.

1127
02:06:09,811 --> 02:06:13,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that had to do with the curriculum transition that we were experiencing.

1128
02:06:15,853 --> 02:06:21,795
[SPEAKER_05]: It is still the case that we think math interventionists at the elementary schools is worthy of consideration.

1129
02:06:21,855 --> 02:06:23,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something that at some point we would want to do.

1130
02:06:24,336 --> 02:06:32,538
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not the case that it would be considered a highest priority at this point, at least as compared to some of the other budgetary objectives.

1131
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:34,359
[SPEAKER_05]: The reading specialists,

1132
02:06:35,297 --> 02:06:37,999
[SPEAKER_05]: It is listed in there, but it is actually a budgeted position now.

1133
02:06:38,499 --> 02:06:42,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we focused on here in these conversations are the increases.

1134
02:06:42,782 --> 02:07:00,813
[SPEAKER_05]: The reading specialist position, it has been, again, it's raw survey data, so there could be various reasons why individuals throughout the organization might name that as a budgetary priority, but it would not be considered an additional FY23 budgetary increase because it's already incorporated into our FY22 budget.

1135
02:07:02,587 --> 02:07:07,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I happen to know the position that you're referring to that happens to be vacant and we need to fill it for compliance purposes.

1136
02:07:07,751 --> 02:07:09,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's without question an urgent priority.

1137
02:07:10,733 --> 02:07:13,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not, it's not an additional budgetary priority.

1138
02:07:13,495 --> 02:07:17,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, and the math coaches, that is one that also, it is also listed here.

1139
02:07:17,879 --> 02:07:24,584
[SPEAKER_05]: That is category A, that is prioritized as something that whether it's, we believe it should be in the operating budget.

1140
02:07:24,884 --> 02:07:30,548
[SPEAKER_05]: We expect it to be a recurring expense, but it is a necessity if we're going to maximize our investment

1141
02:07:30,875 --> 02:07:33,697
[SPEAKER_05]: with respect to the investigations three investment.

1142
02:07:33,757 --> 02:07:42,101
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, there are other things if you comb through that raw data that are not in this, that is not an accident.

1143
02:07:42,842 --> 02:07:51,027
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the deliberations of the senior leadership team and the superintendent determining that while we appreciate everyone's input, not everything's gonna make it into the budget.

1144
02:07:51,287 --> 02:07:54,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say, I think each of our administrators understand that as well.

1145
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:58,771
[SPEAKER_05]: And we appreciate their sort of their honest feedback on that.

1146
02:07:59,653 --> 02:08:06,119
[SPEAKER_05]: There are things in here that we presented to you that also are unlikely to make it into the final recommendation.

1147
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:24,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And for each of those pieces, if the school committee is interested in knowing why, there'll be a rationalization as to why it is we don't think at the moment it is in the best interest of the district to extend our resources to fund those certain priorities.

1148
02:08:26,675 --> 02:08:27,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, in another district,

1149
02:08:28,885 --> 02:08:30,005
[SPEAKER_05]: they would never get to the committee.

1150
02:08:31,266 --> 02:08:45,128
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think it is a nod to our transparency, but it's also a recognition that there are a vast number of priorities that could be funded if resources were unlimited, which as we know, they are not.

1151
02:08:46,409 --> 02:08:47,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1152
02:08:47,449 --> 02:08:47,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1153
02:08:50,830 --> 02:08:51,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Graham.

1154
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:53,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1155
02:08:54,131 --> 02:09:00,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I just listening to the questions from my colleagues, I wanted to sort of

1156
02:09:01,905 --> 02:09:06,287
[SPEAKER_12]: reflect back like for three years, this is my third, I think third budget.

1157
02:09:07,068 --> 02:09:21,756
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think when I started, there was sort of a silent understanding that the administration was never going to like ask for more than what the mayor was prepared to provide.

1158
02:09:22,556 --> 02:09:29,200
[SPEAKER_12]: And over the course of the last three years, like I think as a committee, we've tried to really press the administration

1159
02:09:30,060 --> 02:09:46,314
[SPEAKER_12]: in various ways to tell us what really is needed for the upcoming school year to meet our objectives, to serve students, et cetera, in a more authentic way than had been done in past administrations.

1160
02:09:47,495 --> 02:09:55,861
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that has looked a little bit different each year, but I think we are finally getting to some alignment where our strategic plan

1161
02:09:57,063 --> 02:10:03,086
[SPEAKER_12]: which can and should be a living, breathing document, can guide priorities.

1162
02:10:03,986 --> 02:10:18,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And so some of these things that have been like mainstays of how we do budgeting, like these, like many, many, many hours of department head report, department heads providing very similar year to year conversation about what happens in their department.

1163
02:10:18,814 --> 02:10:24,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we can sort of leave those behind and feel good that this is one of those changes that's good

1164
02:10:25,967 --> 02:10:33,752
[SPEAKER_12]: in terms of the process that we're going through, because there can be alignment, a strategic plan actually exists.

1165
02:10:34,693 --> 02:10:36,334
[SPEAKER_12]: And so therefore we can align to it.

1166
02:10:36,774 --> 02:10:39,716
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really never been the case really before this year.

1167
02:10:41,257 --> 02:10:47,121
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really happy with the progress we're making, particularly because it's always been my

1168
02:10:48,805 --> 02:10:56,930
[SPEAKER_12]: opinion and belief that it's our job to tell the community what Medford Public Schools needs to allow every kid to reach its full potential.

1169
02:10:57,670 --> 02:11:07,636
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the full recognition that that may or may not always align with all the other forces at play that really we have no control over.

1170
02:11:08,657 --> 02:11:13,100
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's our job to be able to say this is really what we think we need for next year.

1171
02:11:13,120 --> 02:11:16,502
[SPEAKER_12]: So I am glad that we're making progress on

1172
02:11:17,302 --> 02:11:31,146
[SPEAKER_12]: a better process that's more aligned, that is transparent as well because we are focused on the alignment to that strategic plan which does provide transparency to these objectives.

1173
02:11:31,806 --> 02:11:40,028
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do think it's always important to hear from the people who are doing the work and we've found a way to sort of release them from

1174
02:11:40,688 --> 02:11:43,570
[SPEAKER_12]: many hours of these meetings, but still collect their input.

1175
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:50,054
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we're continuing to move in the right direction around this process, at least for me.

1176
02:11:51,896 --> 02:11:56,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Even though it is different, I think it's one of those like, this change is good.

1177
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:58,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Could I just say, Ms.

1178
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:07,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Graham, in response, if you look at the math coaches as an example, last year, the delta between the school committee's request and the mayor's recommendation was $760,000.

1179
02:12:08,827 --> 02:12:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: a significant increase from FY21 to FY22.

1180
02:12:13,288 --> 02:12:15,448
[SPEAKER_05]: That's allowed us to make some of the progress that we've had.

1181
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:19,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And frankly, the position is to have a thoughtful conversation about FY23.

1182
02:12:19,549 --> 02:12:30,231
[SPEAKER_05]: That Delta, part of how we bridged it was the initial request included the math coaches that we knew were a good idea, but we also thought they might be premature.

1183
02:12:30,771 --> 02:12:36,672
[SPEAKER_05]: And so part of the way we bridged that gap was when the next recommendation came, when the recommendation came back to the school committee,

1184
02:12:37,022 --> 02:12:42,445
[SPEAKER_05]: based on the perspective of municipal appropriation, we reduced those four positions.

1185
02:12:43,146 --> 02:12:49,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we invested in the math curriculum and positioned ourselves to capitalize on those additional FTEs.

1186
02:12:49,670 --> 02:13:02,718
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, you see that it is somewhere between one and four, but those positions are category A. We know to make good on the math curriculum investment, we're going to need to add some personnel.

1187
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:05,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Frankly, I don't expect it's gonna be four FTEs.

1188
02:13:05,746 --> 02:13:13,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I expect the committee will ask for that and we'll be prepared for that, but we'll also be prepared to implement with the capacity that's allocated to us.

1189
02:13:14,353 --> 02:13:27,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And it will be a good investment, a better investment than it would have been in FY22 because while we could have used them and there could have been, you know, a few things might've been different and we would have made the most of it.

1190
02:13:27,763 --> 02:13:32,387
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think ultimately it is sound fiscal stewardship that we were able to,

1191
02:13:32,757 --> 02:13:36,739
[SPEAKER_05]: find that targeted place to reduce from one recommendation to the other.

1192
02:13:37,139 --> 02:13:43,281
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're able to come back and frankly make a more credible argument to the community that this is an investment that we're ready to make.

1193
02:13:43,641 --> 02:13:49,743
[SPEAKER_05]: And I further expect there will be things this year that will be left on the cutting room floor for FY23.

1194
02:13:50,104 --> 02:14:01,988
[SPEAKER_05]: But as we continue to do this work and advance the strategic objectives of the district, we may well be in a better position in FY24 to make a more compelling case that this is something that's worth the people of Medford's money

1195
02:14:03,224 --> 02:14:03,905
[SPEAKER_05]: in that investment.

1196
02:14:03,925 --> 02:14:06,446
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do think there's a coherency.

1197
02:14:06,486 --> 02:14:12,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I think getting to the place of more coherency is sometimes gonna be a long journey, but we're trying.

1198
02:14:15,309 --> 02:14:15,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1199
02:14:21,752 --> 02:14:22,572
