    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=0.531s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muy rápido, recapitularemos el plan maestro general para el parque que se desarrolló en 2020.
 Haremos un resumen del trabajo de la fase uno que ya se ha completado hasta la fecha.
 Eso incluye la restauración del Muro de Pomp, la restauración del Muro de Fieldstone y la excavación arqueológica, que sé que algunos de ustedes vinieron a ver y participar, así que gracias por eso.
 Tenemos lo que llamamos una nueva actualización del plan maestro.
 Entonces, desde nuestra excavación arqueológica, se nos han proporcionado algunas recomendaciones para implementar.
 Y ese es realmente el quid de la presentación de esta noche que queríamos compartir con la comunidad.
 Y eso realmente ayudará a construir nuestro oleoducto para lo que llamamos fase tres del trabajo en el parque.
 Así que hemos hecho la fase uno, en los próximos meses comenzaremos la fase dos, y ahora estamos construyendo el oleoducto para la fase tres, que es lo que llamamos una caminata histórica, algunas señales, algunos marcadores históricos.
 Y repito, estos son sólo conceptos que vamos a compartir con ustedes esta noche.
 Aún no tenemos los fondos para esta fase y todavía estamos buscando comentarios de la comunidad.
 Pero en cierto modo, ya sabes, estamos comenzando la fase dos, y tenemos que mirar hacia el futuro para la fase tres, queríamos simplemente mantener la pelota en marcha aquí en algunas de las cosas del plan maestro.
 Y luego regresaremos al final para hablar sobre la fase dos y el trabajo que se avecina, que sé que muchos de ustedes probablemente estarán entusiasmados y para el cual hemos asegurado el financiamiento.
 Estamos a punto de comenzar a enviar algunas RFP a proveedores seguros, y ese trabajo está programado para completarse.
 la primera parte del próximo año.
 Y luego, al final, tendremos comentarios, preguntas y comentarios.
 Le pedimos amablemente que terminemos la presentación antes de responder preguntas o comentarios, y luego todos tendrán la oportunidad de hablar al final sobre cualquier cosa que quieran en ese momento.
 Entonces, a partir de este punto, le daré la palabra a Ryan Hayward y Peter Hedlund, quienes repasarán el meollo de la presentación.
 Y chicos, llévenselo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=149.076s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you, Jen, for that introduction, and I think Ryan's going to get the.
 Presentation up on the screen.
 Great.
 Thanks, Ryan.
 So everybody should be looking at just the title slide here.
 My name is Peter Headland, a landscape architect and a planner based in Arlington right next door.
 I was fortunate enough to work on the master plan project and have now been doing a little study on this concept design.
 And we'll talk about that shortly here.
 Okay, next slide.
 Great.
 The 2020 master plan, we started in 2019.
 It was almost a year process.
 It went through 2020.
 And that's all on the historical commission website.
 And at the end of that, we came up with a series of phased implementation projects that could happen over a period of
 20 years, and we'll talk about the first phase of that with the next slide.
 So this shows the first, say, seven of these implementation ideas that came out of the master plan, restoring the wall, the historic wall right on the edge of Grove Street.
 an archaeological dig at the estate, which has also taken place.
 We'll talk about that a little bit.
 Making improvements to the Grove Street edge, the fieldstone wall there.
 Those were in phase one and we'll go over those in a little bit.
 Other projects
 from the master planning include new crosswalks, improvements to the trails, some type of signage to identify the park, and some planting in this central planted LA.
 Okay, on the next slide, we'll talk about that.
 The first step and really the reason for this whole park is what's now known as Pomp's Wall.
 In 2019, the image on the upper left, that was the condition when we began the master plan and we had a historic masonry consultant, Richard Irons, come and maybe some of you heard him talk.
 He gave a presentation a number of years ago.
 He evaluated the wall.
 I wrote up a pretty detailed technical memo about the wall and went over some options to restore the wall.
 Some of you might know that a wall that part of the, in the deed when this part was given to the city of Medford, it stipulated that this wall, they were so proud of this wall, that this wall needed to be forever maintained.
 The preservation and restoration of this wall is really important or else technically, the old estate could take this part back over, but luckily, that's not going to happen.
 The middle slide there shows the previous joint conditions, pretty deteriorated and the capstone needed some significant repair.
 So, in the next slide, we show the process in 2023.
 Mason was hired to do that work.
 This is that restoration.
 A lot of the wall really had to be taken apart and put back together.
 And maybe some of you.
 were there or witnessed some of that progress.
 And the brick on the right side is pretty interesting.
 The contractor pulled that out and you can see a fingerprints on the top of that brick.
 So that's
 Pretty interesting, the wall was said to have been built in 1760, and so those are over 250 years old.
 Were they from Pompeii, the former enslaved person who built the wall?
 Perhaps Medford was known for local brick making and these bricks were sourced locally, but that's really sort of a neat glimpse of history and all those bricks went back into that wall.
 On the next slide, you can see the final result from last year of the newly restored wall with newly pointed bricks.
 They ended up putting a new cap on top of it to really seal that with flashing.
 Hopefully, this will last for the next few generations.
 Okay, so the next project that came out of the master plan in phase 1 was improving the Grove Street edge, the old field stone wall.
 It's an interesting historic image on the right hand side of the screen here, which shows it's looking up Grove Street.
 That is the
 historic wall, formerly known as the slave wall, now known as Pompe's wall.
 And you can see the wall as it was historically, but over time, it had sort of fallen apart in some areas more than others.
 The image on the left here is showing prior to the master plan, you know, the
 wall in this area was pretty gone, and so the thought there was to improve this fieldstone wall.
 And so the next slide shows the results of that.
 With the wall repaired, it really helps to define the edge of the park.
 Also, cutouts were left at intersections for crosswalks to access the park.
 And...
 Another part of that project was for five feet behind that wall, clearing out the understory, a lot of invasive plants have popped up in there.
 Clearing that out a little bit, let these big trees, you can see this one over on the right side, give them a little bit more room to grow.
 Ryan, at the end, we'll talk a little bit about some upcoming planting maintenance improvements.
 Okay, on the next slide, we talk about the third part of this first phase of projects coming out of the master plan, the archaeological dig at the estate.
 Here we see illustration of the Thomas Brooks house that was right behind that wall.
 This later colored here, that's that wall, that's Pomp's Wall.
 You can see the drive right behind it and what this house looked like.
 It was built in 1727.
 The house was demolished in 1860.
 Then it just really sat there because it was never redeveloped and became a park.
 The archaeologists we brought on for the master plan were determined, and they were correct, that this is a highly sensitive area for archaeological findings.
 And the master plan proposed an archaeological dig
 with a professional and to work collaboratively with community volunteers, and that happened.
 And they thought that there was the possibility to find, very good possibility to find both pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.
 And on the next slide, we see that dig, which happened in 2022 and 23.
 Maybe some people on this call, this Zoom meeting were part of that.
 You can see some of the people from the community along with the professionals working on that dig.
 There were 23 test pits and over 1,600 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 And post-contact and pre-contact mean either pre-contact is pre-colonial settlement and post-contact is after settlers arrived.
 So there was both interesting findings from both of those areas, which is pretty neat.
 And here's some of the things that were found.
 That piece of pottery was on that site.
 Okay, next slide please Ryan.
 So there is a pretty detailed survey report from the master plan that made some recommendations.
 They recommended to protect and preserve this site, specifically this estate site area.
 They thought it was a highly sensitive area in and around the house site, and that in this area, that any below ground disturbance should be avoided or ideally kept at a real minimum.
 And that will come into play when we talk about the concept for this area.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan.
 We see where that area is.
 This is the approximate house location.
 We're looking south on the dirt path.
 You can kind of see the back of Pomp's wall there.
 So that's generally where that house was.
 On the next slide, we have a couple images looking both south on that site.
 Some low vinca has grown up there.
 Maybe,
 A remnant from ground cover that was planted originally that could be possible.
 And then this is looking north.
 It was a pretty open site originally around that estate, but trees have have grown in over time.
 Okay, and the next slide.
 We see a couple other just context views of the north entrance.
 This is the newly reconstructed wall and the break in the wall at the roadway opposite.
 This is looking south on the south approach and you can see the open lawn there.
 These are the two ways that visitors would get to this area.
 Next slide.
 Okay, so we've been working for the last number of months and through a couple meetings on a design concept for this central area for this historically sensitive area, and I'll walk you through the main.
 Concepts here, and with the 3 big ideas for the design concept to improve accessibility to the park.
 And help identify the park as such as as a park and to make some of this really interesting history visible.
 I remember when I first started working on the master plan, and I.
 was out exploring the park, it's definitely not evident that it is or was a town-owned property.
 And so the improvements to the walls certainly help.
 And some simple signage will help to identify it as an important historical park for the town of Medford.
 So the first concept is a history wall.
 which is a, these paths really sort of already exist, they're dirt pathways, mostly, and creating a loop here in this thicker orange line that would help to connect
 a number of these historically sensitive areas and use historic markers to interpret the history a little bit.
 And we'll go through each of those.
 But these blue circles are those 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 markers there.
 Also, two potential areas for welcome signs to the park.
 We'll talk about the
 interpretation and stabilization measures around the former estate site.
 And you have to be able to get to the park, so new crosswalks and accessible parking.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan, we'll kind of walk through each of these.
 First is the history walk.
 The walk, again, in this thicker orange here, it would be an accessible path in terms of slope and surfacing.
 We haven't done a detailed, there hasn't been a detailed field survey done of this area of the park, but we think that it can be an accessible path below 5% slope.
 And we'd like to connect that to new crosswalks so people from this community, or maybe who are parking there could get into this park.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 There are 2 potential areas for welcome signs, and Ryan will talk a little bit more about this at the end.
 It would be great to identify the park, to name it, and to welcome visitors, to make them feel welcome.
 So here, opposite Jackson Road or potentially Ravine Road to the north are 2 potential areas for welcome signs.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 just a little bit history about Thomas Brooks Park.
 This is 1860 Brooks estate plan, which was pretty big.
 A lot of this land has since been given to the city of Medford.
 Our little sliver right there is Thomas Brooks Park.
 You can tell it's this almost like sharp triangle.
 Up on the upper right is
 at H.F.
 Walling Plan from 1855.
 And here we see our park there.
 It's easy to identify the railroad, which is this diagonal line, and then Grove Street.
 And so that sliver right there is what the future park looked like in 1855.
 It is adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.
 And then the six-acre park was conveyed to the city in 1924, again, with the stipulation that the
 brick wall, now known as Pomp's Wall, be forever maintained.
 On the next slide, we talk about these historic markers.
 Originally, in earlier iteration, this walk was just a linear path from here to here.
 But then as we took some feedback and evolved it a little bit, it's become more of a loop.
 Pomp's wall is right here just to orient everyone.
 It's great.
 And Grove Street is right here.
 So the proposal is to have a series of five simple historic markers so that visitors to the site would help to understand the rich history here a little bit better.
 Both the Native American history,
 which marker could be there, the African American history with this pretty remarkable wall, Pomp's Wall, that's just been restored.
 There's a pretty fascinating history of water systems and the Middlesex Canal here, and
 This is an appropriate place for that historic marker because it looks out over this lawn.
 We'll talk about that in a little bit.
 And then on the back of the park here, you're right next to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, now known as the MBTA Lowell Branch Railroad.
 which also has a rich history, and then coming around to the colonial American history of the site and the sort of remains of the Thomas Brooke estate and thinking about how to interpret and mark that.
 Okay, so over the next handful of slides, we move to the next one, we'll talk about how to do that and why that's important.
 So the Native American historic marker, again, with the archaic,
 I have a hard time saying that word today.
 With the dig that was just done, there were 64 pre-contact artifacts found collected during the 22-23 dig, which is pretty neat.
 Maybe some community members on this call or in this picture, I don't know.
 Largely, the items that were found were chipping debris and pottery shards.
 presumably from the middle to late Woodlands period, 2000 to 450 years ago.
 So pretty significant historical resource.
 And this has a potential for rich Native American history, given the proximity of water resources and the
 topography.
 So that's pretty invisible now, but it'd be great to make that history a little bit more visible, just with a simple interpretive marker.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we talk about Pomp's Wall.
 Okay, the existing marker, which is there, if you want to
 Sneak on the edge of the roadway and or peek at it from your car is shown on the upper right there.
 This upper left is a historic photo, which the date is unknown of, and the photo in the middle is from 1899.
 So you can look up Grove Street.
 You can see the wall, it's beginning to get overgrown there, but pretty open behind it, some of the big trees there.
 We know the wall was constructed around 1760, that the city is required to preserve and forever maintain it in that deed.
 to the city, it stipulates that.
 And then there was this recent, very important restoration and renaming of the wall.
 So that's an important history to help make visible.
 Okay, if we go to the next slide, we can help to mark in a way the importance of the Medford water systems.
 This picture on the left is a little hard to see.
 All these slides will be posted on the
 Historical Commission website.
 And if you look on there, there's a lot of information from the past number of years from all the studies and meetings that were done.
 This is a plaque elsewhere in Medford that shows the Middlesex Canal and the route.
 Our little park
 is right here.
 You can see the railroad and Grove Street.
 And so this Middlesex Canal was right to the south of this area.
 The Middlesex Canal was around from 1793 to 1853, ran from Charlestown to Lowell.
 It was partly financed by the Brooks family, which has such a prominent role.
 in the city of Medford.
 It supplied much of the lumber for shipbuilding in Medford.
 That was such a big industry in the city.
 On the lower right is an image of one of the bridges.
 There were a number of
 bridges, 50 bridges, all along the canal.
 And this was one in Medford that was taken down.
 But we think that some of these blocks were used in this Grove Street field stone wall, especially south of Pomp's Wall.
 You can go look and the stones there are more cut in.
 rectilinear blocks.
 I can't get into a lot of it here, but there's really a fascinating study that the head of the MWRA did on the role of Medford in the whole water and sewer development for the city of Boston in the nearby area.
 It's pretty fascinating.
 area where we're proposing this historic marker looking out on that field, well part of the reason the field is there and it's not overgrown is because there's a sewer easement that actually runs through there.
 And so there's a lot of interesting things to talk about for a potential historic marker talking about these water systems and the task will be how to distill this information in a concise way.
 Okay.
 If we go to the next slide, I talked a little bit about the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the proposals for historic marker on the backside of Thomas Brooks Park, talking about this, that this railroad was constructed in 1835.
 Also,
 partly financed by the Brooks family, the people didn't really want the railroad to happen, especially the people who were invested in the canal because the railroad made the canal not as necessary.
 And it essentially replaced the canal in order to speed up.
 Transportation provide year-round freight transportation because the canal would freeze in the winter.
 This railroad, it was the first major railroad in the state, one of the first in the whole Northeast, and it's still used today.
 It's an active rail line as the MBTA Lowell line.
 That's an image on the bottom right.
 You can see Boston and Lowell there.
 Okay, and Ryan, if you go to the next slide, the last historic marker kind of gets back to what we started with, with the dig on the site.
 Now, this is an image of the Brooks Estate House, and the historic marker would help to reinterpret that or interpret that history.
 that this house was built in 1727, you can see here there was a little curved driveway behind that brick wall.
 And that's essentially where, if you walk out there, where that dirt footpath is and where that history walk would be.
 Then you can see the brick wall between the street and the driveway, that's the palms wall.
 We know historically it was noted that there were three black walnut trees in front of the house.
 You can see them in this illustration and also those original trees aren't there.
 But if you're out there in that park, there are black walnut trees that are descendants, I think, of these original trees.
 Then as we know, there are a lot of artifacts recovered.
 from the dig over 1600 from the post-contact or colonial era.
 Okay, on the next slide, we looked at this site.
 This is the general area of that estate house, and the proposal is to both protect and preserve and interpret this site a little bit by marking the
 Corners of where the house was with simple stone blocks and stabilizing the surface with low plantings.
 And then this would be the blue circle that historic marker, which would be able to interpret it.
 So, if you go to the next slide.
 This was one of the site precedents that we looked at, Robbins Farm Park.
 It's a neat park right next door to Medford, up on the top of the hill.
 There's an old farm there.
 It was given to the city, turned into a park, and maybe probably 10 years or so ago,
 Park and Recreation Commission wanted to sort of memorialize the house in the former farm there.
 And so they put, they marked the foundation here with these stone blocks.
 These are kind of similar to what we're thinking for Thomas Brooks Park.
 And they had a simple sign in their case, it was right on the block.
 In our case, maybe it would be a separate standing element as a way to
 Talk about the former farmhouse that was there and give people a sense of that history a little bit.
 Okay, on the next slide we have another site that's interpreted the historic history, tracing the foundations of historic house.
 This is the Governor Winthrop House in Charleston, the great house site where they used found stones and some foundation stones and brought those to the surface and
 Trace that foundation there and then just a simple lawn is a very different setting their more urban area and more extensive historic sign that you can see on the bottom right.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 We also would like to stabilize the surface in a very simple way with ground cover planting.
 There's already a little bit of that there with a vinca that's taken over, naturalized the site a little bit.
 And on the next slide, we'd like to add to that a little bit with a nice native plant, gold star.
 It's native, shade-tolerant, a lot of trees around, pretty low, 6-12 inches tall, and has a nice bloom from the late spring into the fall.
 You can imagine walking on this path and coming across these blocks and a little burst of flowers might be a pretty elegant, beautiful, but yet subtle way to think about this site.
 On the next slide, we talked about another way that we could use plants to bring back the history.
 This is Syringa vulgaris, a common lilac, which is for hundreds of years been part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 And the quote on the bottom here is from the
 Medford paper in 1912, that some of the historic research which the state did, which predated the master plan, they pulled together, and I'll just read the quote, beside the street, Grove Street, and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 So they're talking about Palm's Wall and they're talking about Grove Street, which by the looks of this was originally bordered with lilac.
 So wouldn't it be neat, the upper right image is of the Arnold Arboretum on Lilac Sunday.
 Pro tip, that's a great place to go.
 Amazingly,
 blooms in the middle of May.
 We'd like to bring those lilacs back at the wall.
 On the next slide, we can see a picture of the wall.
 This is looking right up Grove Street and Palm's wall over on the right hand side with a field stone wall next to it.
 And on the next slide, just a little illustration of what some lilacs would look like right behind that wall.
 It would look pretty nice for vehicles or people on the sidewalk over on the other side here.
 It's a nice southern orientation there, southwest orientation.
 So I think those lilacs would do well.
 And at the same time, we could plant some, just a low ground cover on the roadside to help stabilize that embankment there.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we have a look at the existing conditions behind Pompe's wall and up that path so this would be the history walk and then the next slide shows a little illustration of
 what that might look like with some lilacs over on the side in this simple walkway that would then loop around with a series of historic markers and then the stone blocks at the estate house to give a deeper understanding of the rich history of this site.
 Okay, on the next slide, I believe we're hopping into some information Ryan from the historical commission can share on the upcoming improvements for the second phase at the park.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=1938.088s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Gracias, Pedro.
 Muy bien, ahora sólo quiero profundizar rápidamente en la actualización de la construcción de la fase 2.
 Entonces, solo para reiterar lo que Jen dijo al principio, tenemos un plan maestro a partir de 2020, pero el documento es un documento vivo sujeto a cambios.
 va a evolucionar.
 Entonces, independientemente de lo que esté en el plan maestro, estoy seguro de que algunos de ustedes lo habrán leído, la fase que estamos usando es diferente a la fase que se requiere en la construcción.
 Entonces, para esta fase de financiamiento, que ha sido financiada en su totalidad gracias a una generosa subvención de la Comisión de Preservación Comunitaria, estamos buscando hacer una excavación arqueológica más grande, estamos buscando podar algunos árboles y eliminar madera muerta, la requerida Ley de Estadounidenses con Discapacidades,
 Acceso arquitectónico para los cortes de acera, la acera y su espacio de estacionamiento.
 Estamos buscando identificar los cruces de peatones al marcarlos y colocar algunos letreros y luego, por supuesto, estamos buscando identificar este lugar como un parque público.
 Hay algunas cosas que se están considerando.
 Estamos analizando, por supuesto, este límite arqueológico del que Peter acaba de hablar y que se encuentra en las primeras fases de planificación.
 Y, por supuesto, estamos considerando cosas como mejorar la definición de los senderos, agregar árboles apropiados al sitio y hacer algunos cortes de maleza y cortes invasivos a medida que plantamos árboles.
 Pero, por supuesto, lo que no se está considerando, lo escuchamos hace mucho tiempo cuando tuvimos la reunión pública y lo hemos escuchado en este punto, aunque está en el plan maestro, no estamos considerando en absoluto el jardín comunitario o el puente del ferrocarril.
 Así que dejaré eso de lado para que la gente sepa que lo que estamos considerando son cosas de bajo impacto para el parque, ¿de acuerdo?
 Entonces, para la arqueología, buscamos contratar a un arqueólogo para explorar el sitio de la Casa Thomas Brooks y las personas que viven allí, tanto la familia Brooks como sus sirvientes contratados.
 Es un tema poco conocido que se ha explorado.
 El sitio tiene muchos vínculos con la esclavitud en Nueva Inglaterra, por lo que es un lugar realmente importante.
 Entonces, antes de hacer cualquier tipo de límite que
 protege permanentemente el sitio, queremos finalizar la debida diligencia arqueológica al respecto.
 Y buscaremos voluntarios de la comunidad, al igual que la vez anterior, podemos hacer que la gente nos ayude con el tamizado de la tierra y el trabajo de laboratorio de los artefactos para que la gente pueda verlos.
 Así que ciertamente nos esforzaremos por lograrlo.
 Y lo que concluirá nuestro trabajo con la parte de arqueología será el límite que esperamos instalar entre
 ya sabes, el paseo histórico de Peter y la interpretación de la casa y los paneles interpretativos y todo eso para proteger este sitio de cualquier tipo de impacto negativo.
 Hay mucha poda de árboles por hacer.
 Entonces, para esto estamos analizando las preocupaciones más inmediatas que se relacionan con los 50 árboles de aproximadamente 150 años que se encuentran en este sitio.
 De ellos, hay 30 árboles históricos que se encuentran en relativamente buenas condiciones.
 Necesitan poda, como luz de poda, y solo para quitar ahí, algunas ramas muertas, algunos líderes se han partido, pero hay 10
 árboles dentro y alrededor del parque que están completamente muertos.
 Puedes ver aquí a la derecha esta imagen donde sus líderes se han dividido por completo y no queda nada y esos árboles deben ser eliminados por seguridad pública.
 En otras, como en la imagen del extremo izquierdo, se puede ver que el líder se ha separado y cuelga precariamente sobre algunos de los senderos.
 Así que estamos buscando
 recórtelos todos para que el parque esté seguro de un extremo al otro.
 Y hay dos arces noruegos invasores que están completamente muertos.
 Se elevan sobre el sitio.
 Miden unos 20 pies de altura, pero sólo tienen unos 15 años.
 Aquellos que esperamos eliminar porque lo son, cualquier árbol de ese tamaño es una molestia y pasa por alto el derecho de paso de la MBTA.
 Pero con toda esa poda de árboles,
 Esperamos plantar 15 árboles nuevos.
 Y digo robles, pero al hablar con City Tree Warden, podría ser un roble, podrían ser arces azucareros, árboles que son nativos de Nueva Inglaterra y nativos de este sitio que queremos reemplazar los arces noruegos invasores que están aquí y tenemos un plan para continuar plantando árboles que serán curados, por así decirlo, para que el parque se convierta en un parque y mantenga esa sensación de bosque.
 Ahora, como parte de este proyecto, una de las piezas clave más importantes es que buscamos eliminar toda la madera muerta en todo el sitio.
 Entonces sabemos que hubo algunos trozos de madera muerta que fueron retirados de la calle cuando ocurrió la tormenta de hielo en Grove Street.
 El DPW ha estado socavando eso.
 Vamos a completar ese trabajo.
 Y luego, por supuesto, hubo varios árboles que fueron derribados durante el muro por razones de seguridad pública.
 Todos esos van a ser eliminados.
 Y luego todos los diversos excrementos de árboles que provienen de árboles históricos que están muriendo o que están muertos serán removidos de un extremo al otro del parque.
 Así que será una limpieza total de arriba a abajo.
 Gran parte de ese material, si es demasiado grande, será retirado del sitio.
 Si es más pequeño,
 y se puede triturar, pondremos algo de eso nuevamente en el camino para que haya alguna definición en los caminos.
 Para mejoras de accesibilidad, tenemos varios a lo largo y ancho del parque.
 El más importante es que vamos a reconectar la acera a lo largo del lado este de Grove Street que actualmente no tiene salida en Newton Street hasta la nueva entrada en Jackson Road.
 Pondremos cortes de acera en todas las aberturas de las paredes.
 Habrá pasarelas rayadas en Jackson Road, Gravine Road y Layard Road.
 Habrá señalización para el paso de peatones.
 Y, por supuesto, todo esto llevará mucho tiempo porque hay muchos actores clave.
 Así que lo estamos explorando y trabajando en diseños y conceptos, pero el departamento de obras públicas de la ciudad, el departamento de tránsito, todos ellos tienen que entrar en juego a medida que comenzamos a avanzar con este proyecto.
 Así que recién estamos comenzando y faltan muchos, muchos meses.
 pero esperamos comenzar con la construcción tal vez en la primavera de 2025 para que básicamente podamos comenzar bien el año y en el primer período posible de construcción después del invierno comenzaremos y entregaremos estas cosas en las que hemos estado trabajando durante más de un año.
 Para el espacio, será necesario señalizarlos en algún lugar cercano como parte de la ruta accesible y del camino accesible alrededor del parque, un espacio de estacionamiento único.
 Cuando estábamos desarrollando originalmente el plan maestro, se nos pidió que mantuviéramos los automóviles fuera del parque.
 Así que tenemos que proporcionar un espacio accesible según la ADA en algún lugar.
 Trabajaremos con los residentes, todos ustedes, para tratar de ubicarlo en un lugar que sea conveniente tanto para la ruta accesible como para los residentes.
 Pero también requiere que la ciudad celebre una audiencia pública con el departamento de tránsito.
 Así que habrá muchas, muchas más oportunidades para abordar dónde y cómo encaja este espacio.
 Y por supuesto,
 Los pensamientos han cambiado.
 Hay acceso.
 No es lo preferido, pero podríamos volver a colocar el espacio de estacionamiento en el sitio si fuera necesario.
 Para marcar las aceras, queremos que sea simple.
 Ya sabes, bastará con una simple acera pintada.
 Señalización al mínimo.
 Hablamos con el departamento de tráfico el otro día.
 La preferencia tal vez por un letrero luminoso, en todo caso, sería Jackson Road.
 donde hay una alta concentración de personas cruzando hacia la entrada principal del parque, tal vez incluso una ruta segura para los residentes que van y vienen de la escuela.
 Pero dependiendo de lo que escuchemos en busca de comentarios, eso está sujeto a discusión.
 Y luego, la señalización del parque. Hay dos tipos diferentes de señalización del parque.
 Están los carteles que dan la bienvenida a la gente al paseo histórico y los carteles interpretativos.
 Pero realmente, para esta fase, buscamos identificar el parque como parque.
 Y esperamos tener algo similar al letrero de Brooks Estate justo al final de la calle.
 Este sitio se relaciona con el
 Propiedad de Brooks Estate, pero puede tener su propia identidad.
 Así que todavía no tenemos un diseño verdadero, pero sí algo que lo identifique como un parque de la ciudad con algo de historia para que todos sepan que no es sólo un pedazo de bosque abandonado, que realmente es un lugar importante para Medford.
 Y luego, por supuesto, con la planificación continua, hay cosas que estamos considerando como parte de este proyecto que conducirán a otros proyectos.
 Contamos con trabajos de árboles históricos.
 En algún momento, hay un callejón de robles y nogales negros que nos gustaría abrir y.
 tal vez reduzca algunos de los arces noruegos invasores.
 Pero estamos escuchando y entendemos que actualmente la vegetación actúa como una especie de pantalla sonora.
 Entonces, como parte de eso, hablaríamos de tal vez plantar algunos árboles para que esos árboles más grandes y más apropiados puedan aumentar de tamaño mientras el paisaje existente se reduce.
 Y para que siempre se mantenga ese buffer de sonido.
 Pero repito, esa es una fase posterior, muchas, muchas, muchas, muchas eliminaciones.
 Pero el más importante es que parte del trabajo en los árboles que se está realizando aliviará el daño a la cerca de la MBTA.
 Así que haremos que la MBTA trabaje con nosotros para reparar su cerca para que el parque sea seguro, para que nadie pueda atravesar la plataforma del riel cuando todo esté dicho y hecho.
 Y ese es el quid de lo que estamos haciendo para la fase dos.
 Entonces sabemos que ustedes tienen comentarios y preguntas.
 Así que creo que si desea hacer un comentario o tiene alguna pregunta para nosotros, estaremos encantados de atenderla.
 Sólo pedimos que la gente levante la mano.
 Y, por supuesto, no es necesario hacer todos los comentarios esta noche.
 No es el fin de todo.
 Vamos a intentar seguir adelante con el trabajo de campo arqueológico, que no
 cualquier impacto en el parque que no sea cavar y excavar y luego tapar y luego parte del trabajo de los árboles por motivos de seguridad, pero el resto del trabajo nuevamente dentro de seis meses para finalizar el diseño, así que aceptaremos comentarios y estaremos felices de recibir correos electrónicos si saben que las cosas surgen más adelante y si quieren tomarse un tiempo para digerir lo que escucharon esta noche y ponerlo en
 Y por supuesto, como dije al comienzo de la reunión, si no tenemos su correo electrónico, si no está en nuestra lista de contactos, envíenos un correo electrónico y estaremos felices de agregarlo a nuestros correos y publicidad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2629.627s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Gracias, Ryan.
 Gracias, Pedro.
 Y como dijo Ryan, estoy feliz de abrir la palabra para comentarios o preguntas en este momento.
 Si alguien tiene algo, si quiere levantar la mano, le quitaré el silencio y le llamaré.
 Tamara, si quieres activar el sonido.
 Nick, ¿podemos darnos tu dirección para que conste, por favor?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2651.095s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sí.
 14 Newton Road en West Medford en el lado sur del parque Thomas Brook.
 Muy brevemente, solo quiero agradecerles a todos por su atención, por escuchar a la comunidad, por sus intentos y su arduo trabajo para preservar lo que es histórico y endémico en esta área.
 Sólo quiero decir gracias.
 Obviamente, su presentación requirió mucho trabajo.
 Claramente estás escuchando a la comunidad y me encanta lo que estás haciendo y realmente lo aprecio.
 Así que muchas gracias por todo su arduo trabajo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2683.696s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muchas gracias.
 Dave, veo tu mano si quieres activar el sonido.
 ¿Podemos obtener su nombre y dirección para que conste en acta, por favor?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2691.141s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Entonces mi pregunta es: ¿se ha tenido en cuenta alguna cosa?
 Lo que está sucediendo y ha estado sucediendo desde mucho antes de que viviéramos aquí, la gente que va al parque simplemente corta por allí y el muro no está terminado de nuestro lado.
 Eso es un poco molesto para los que vivimos aquí.
 Mucha gente simplemente corta el césped, corta el césped, corta el camino de entrada.
 Y mi opinión es que si esa parte del muro no se completa, la gente de nuestro lado de la calle hasta High Street, todos los que están en esa área, seguirán atravesando nuestra propiedad y atravesando Brooks Estate de esa manera.
 Y menos personas van a utilizar todos los objetivos que ustedes tienen con los diferentes
 Um, ya sabes, las ubicaciones y los pasillos y todo lo demás.
 Así que no sé si se ha hablado de terminar esa parte del muro en nuestro lado de donde vivimos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2766.663s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Entonces puedo hacer un comentario y luego Ryan probablemente también quiera intervenir.
 Hemos escuchado muchos comentarios sobre ese extremo del muro.
 Y exactamente por la razón de la que estás hablando, que fue la razón por la que estaba cerrado en ese lugar, porque la gente cruzaba propiedad privada para entrar al parque.
 Y por esa razón y las líneas de visión desde la perspectiva del tráfico, la apertura se movió hacia arriba para que haya una manera más fácil de cruzar la calle.
 Ahora sabemos que no es ideal tener que zigzaguear de un lado a otro.
 Y es por eso que en esta próxima fase, ampliaremos la acera del mismo lado de la calle hasta la abertura que ahora existe para que la gente no tenga que cruzar de un lado a otro.
 Tampoco tienen que cruzar tu camino de entrada, Dave, y entrar a tu propiedad para llegar al área cubierta de césped del parque.
 Así que estamos trabajando en ello, entendemos y escuchamos las frustraciones de la gente en el extremo inferior de Grove Street y en esas calles laterales, y estamos tratando de hacer que sea más fácil para la gente de ese lado de la calle no tener que cruzar la calle dos veces.
 Y Ryan, siéntete libre de participar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2841.618s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Sí, simplemente, ya sabes, definitivamente queremos poner esa acera.
 Deliberadamente dejamos la pared cinco pies atrás solo para asegurarnos de que hubiera espacio para poner una acera.
 Y habrá, ya sabes, hay un árbol en ese lado alrededor del cual la pared se curva, así que desaparecerá.
 Y creo que hay una señal para el badén que deberá ajustarse.
 Pero luego habrá una acera agradable y acogedora hasta la entrada principal.
 Quedará claro que, ya sabes, si hay alguna señalización en el cruce de peatones y, ya sabes, si colocamos alguna señalización luminosa, por así decirlo, para que la gente sepa por las noches o cuando hay poca luz que es un cruce de peatones, será más evidente bajar a la entrada principal del parque y detenerse allí.
 Ya sabes, actualmente es,
 Es un camino de deseo, pero si le damos a la gente una alternativa que esté limpia y mantenida, poco a poco se resolverá por sí solo.
 Al igual que en el extremo opuesto del parque, también cerramos el otro extremo en el puente ferroviario de Grove Street por motivos de seguridad pública.
 Y nuevamente, los residentes treparon el muro porque la gente lo había estado haciendo, pero parece que todo se resolvió por sí solo.
 Así que pensamos que con el tiempo también lo hará.
 resolverse por sí solo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2930.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Zoe, veo tu mano.
 Si pudiera darnos su nombre y dirección en el registro, por favor.
 Sí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2935.229s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Soy Zoe Moutsos del 33 de Johnson Ave.
 Hola dave.
 Vecino de Dave.
 Y yo soy un infractor que recorre su propiedad para entrar al parque.
 Quiero hablar de la gente que está en nuestra isla de Tyler y Johnson Ave.
 y es por eso que hacemos esto.
 En el plano original que vi, había una entrada en Newton Road, y eso hubiera sido genial.
 No sé por qué se eliminó eso o por qué no sucedió, pero vivimos en una parte de Medford que simplemente no tiene fácil acceso a espacios verdes.
 Nuestros niños tienen que cruzar múltiples calles concurridas y aterradoras.
 Para llegar a jugar, dijo que estamos cruzando literalmente una vía de ferrocarril y tocamos dicho camino hacia la derecha para llegar a este pequeño parque.
 Vamos a cruzar, ya sabes, a menos que podamos caminar hasta el supermercado y entrar al parque.
 Sabes, estamos cruzando la calle Grove, que es como una autopista.
 Entonces creo que esta es la razón por la que.
 Por eso, no recuerdo cuál fue el lenguaje que usó Ryan, por eso la gente camina en esa dirección, y por eso nos sentimos tan decepcionados cuando no se siguió el plan y se cerró.
 Creo que podríamos haber hecho algo allí para derribar algunos de esos árboles y permitir que la gente entrara y no caminara por la propiedad de Dave, porque entiendo que eso es, eso no es,
 Lo apropiado no es lo ideal, pero lo que nos ha dejado es la opción de correr a través del tráfico con niños y perros en la oscuridad que no está bien iluminada, caminando por un camino. Dudo que ese camino sea lo suficientemente ancho como para cumplir con la ADA para las calles.
 No puedo imaginar que lo sea.
 Y ahora mismo está lleno de baches, está lleno de vidrio, es realmente,
 Gran parte de ese parque es muy hermoso, y sé que será maravilloso cuando esté terminado, pero es una gran decepción al menos para mí en Johnson Ave, y conozco a otras personas en el área que esencialmente, nuevamente, estamos atrapados en una autopista de calles donde la gente acelera.
 Y no podemos llegar al espacio verde más cercano que tengamos.
 Entonces, supongo que mi punto es que tal vez podríamos considerar poner Newton Road que se suponía que estaba allí.
 Y también, aparte de toda mi perorata sobre eso, gracias por escucharme.
 Hay toneladas de invasores en ese parque.
 Hay verruga negra, mostaza con ajo, hiedra venenosa, como es necesario, como si los invasores no fueran solo los noruegos, ¿verdad?
 Entonces me pregunto, cuando la gente esté allí, ¿existe algún plan para manejar esos invasores?
 Porque, Dios mío, la mostaza con ajo de los últimos dos años, si estás en esa especie de,
 limpieza del parque.
 No sé de qué hablamos.
 Realmente no prestamos mucha atención a esa área en esta presentación, pero el área clara que está justo al lado de Newton Road, si miras hacia adentro, ahora es casi toda mostaza con ajo y verruga negra.
 Eso sólo va a seguir empeorando.
 De todos modos, gracias.
 Sé que va a ser genial, pero realmente me encantaría pensar realmente en la entrada segura y en el hecho de que Grove Street es realmente peligrosa.
 La gente conduce muy rápido por esa carretera.
 Gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3125.498s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Gracias Zoé.
 Y también vivo en Grove Street, así que te escucho perfectamente.
 Me gustaría simplemente hablar con John Ardizzone, porque veo tu mano levantada, y la vi antes, y sé que no estás usando la mano en Zoom.
 Así que sólo quería ahorrarte el tener que levantar la mano.
 Entonces, John, si quieres activar el sonido y si podemos obtener tu nombre y dirección para que conste en acta, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3147.976s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: John art solo se vive en 53 Johnson Avenue durante 30 años.
 Entonces conozco toda la historia de este parque.
 y soy dueño del 69 de Grove Street.
 Mi inquilino es David.
 La gente camina por mi camino de entrada hacia el parque, no debería ser así.
 Se suponía que estaba bloqueado.
 Ésa es sólo una cuestión.
 El otro problema es todo este proceso de ganar tanto, hay mucho tráfico en esta calle y estás poniendo más y más tráfico en ella.
 La otra cosa es que estamos hablando de personas que traen a sus hijos.
 Es estrictamente un parque para perros.
 Soy uno de ellos, he estado aquí más tiempo que nadie en esta foto.
 Peter, Ryan, cualquiera de estas personas ha venido.
 No han estado allí tanto tiempo como yo.
 Estuve allí cuando era un jardín de la victoria, cuando tenían jardines comunitarios allí.
 Fue hermoso.
 Estás hablando de cuando construyeron el muro, destruyeron todas las plantas que había detrás de esos muros y todos los árboles.
 Se suponía que los chicos que hicieron la pared debían levantarla suavemente como lo hicieron en la parte superior del supermercado.
 Estos tipos simplemente lo derribaron.
 Hicieron montones de rocas.
 Luego, la otra cosa es que estás hablando de que tu vista es muy sensible.
 Recogieron cinco o diez ruedas de piedra de tres cuartos de pulgada sobre mi camino de entrada, lo agrietaron y las arrojaron al campo.
 ¿Bueno?
 Se suponía que esa piedra sería utilizada como base de ese hermoso muro que construyeron.
 Nunca usaron nada de la piedra.
 Cuando terminaron, entraron con una retroexcavadora y nivelaron la cosa.
 Trabajo en la zona.
 He trabajado en el área durante 30 años.
 Conozco la historia de esto.
 Estás hablando de canales y hablas de excavaciones arqueológicas.
 El pueblo, la ciudad, ha estado cortando el césped allí y destrozando el lugar durante años.
 Solía ​​haber mucha tranquilidad en Grove Street.
 Ahora todo lo que haces es escuchar los trenes porque quitaste toda la basura alrededor de esas rocas.
 Tienes que literalmente entraron y cortaron 20 pies detrás de esa pared, derribaron todas las paredes de allí.
 No empezaron así.
 Cuando empezaron el puente, lo hicieron bonito y prolijo.
 Incluso usan piedra al principio.
 Estoy en el negocio de la construcción.
 Lo sé.
 Cuando hayan llegado a un tercio del camino, olvídense de la piedra.
 Olvídate de rodear los árboles.
 Simplemente derribaron todo.
 Ahora hay un desastre ahí atrás.
 Lo que deberías haber hecho es simplemente limpiar el parque.
 El ruido, la bebida, quieres quitarle el bolsillo a la gente.
 Pero el problema es que toda esta gente está hablando de lo maravilloso que es esto.
 No viven al lado.
 No les afecta.
 Pones un camino hacia abajo.
 Mi amigo Mike David, su esposa es mi sobrina.
 Hay gente ahí abajo a las 10 de la noche, paseando a sus perros.
 No hay niños, los únicos niños que juegan en ese parque viven en la casa al lado de 69 Grove.
 Entran allí, son niños de lacrosse.
 No hay niños ahí, es un parque para perros.
 Vale, lleno de porquería de perro.
 Estás hablando de un sitio grande que quieres mantener limpio y agradable.
 Llevas 30 años dejando que los perros caguen ahí.
 Nadie conoce la historia de esta propiedad.
 Estás hablando de historia, de agua.
 Tienes una servidumbre de agua de Massachusetts pasando por allí.
 Hay una servidumbre de MBTA al lado de mi casa.
 Soy el único verdadero coautor de esa propiedad.
 Nunca me avisaste.
 Es como, ¿por qué?
 He hablado con el departamento de tráfico.
 ¿Vas a poner un paso de peatones al final de mi camino de entrada?
 ¿Qué pasará entonces cuando alguien se eche atrás?
 Si retroceden, volverán a estar en un cruce de peatones.
 Se supone que los cruces peatonales deben estar a 120 pies de una estructura existente, a menos que así lo requiera.
 No lo requiere.
 Vas a caminar, la gente va a caminar, ¿y adónde van a ir?
 Estás hablando, y alguien más dijo que es el único lugar para los niños.
 Medford tiene más espacios verdes.
 Mi hijo es un animal salvaje.
 Conoce cada espacio verde de esta ciudad.
 Tenemos más espacios verdes en Medford, Mystic Lakes y Brooks Estates.
 Debe haber 100 acres ahí atrás.
 Tienes que cruzar la calle hacia un espacio verde.
 La gente tiene mucha suerte de vivir en West Medford.
 Y lo que pasa es que lo están destruyendo haciendo cosas como esta.
 Entra allí y limpia el parque.
 La pared de mi entrada, ¿por qué no la completas?
 Vas a hacer un muro, vas a poner una acera, solo consigue, envía a tus muchachos mañana y completa el muro.
 ¿Por qué no haces eso?
 Piensas que si vives en el supermercado 69 y sales y alguien camina detrás de tu auto, estarías loco.
 A las 10 de la noche, hay gente paseando a sus perros.
 No está en tu patio trasero, así que no te molesta.
 Una persona vive en Jackson Road, una persona vive en Tyler, una persona vive en John.
 Ninguna de estas personas ha estado allí tanto tiempo como yo.
 Estuve allí, nunca hubo problema.
 Hermoso barrio.
 Los bosques estaban mucho mejor de lo que están ahora.
 No los cuidaste durante años.
 De vez en cuando, cortabas el césped en ellos.
 Esa abertura, ese camino de entrada, era una abertura muy pequeña.
 Lo que pasó fue que quitaron las piedras grandes para poder meter sus cortadoras de césped.
 Así empezó todo.
 Soy dueño de esa casa desde 2003 y desde entonces he vivido en Johnson Avenue durante 30 años.
 Acabo de vender mi casa allí y todavía soy dueño de 69 Grocery.
 Ya hice contactos.
 El departamento de tráfico vendrá aquí.
 No quieren problemas allí.
 Nunca tuvimos ningún problema en Johnson Avenue.
 Destruyeron la otra parte donde Johnson Avenue se encuentra con la tienda de comestibles.
 Destruyeron esa zona.
 Allí nunca hubo ningún accidente.
 Juan, muchas gracias por tus comentarios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3494.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Necesito pasar a algunos otros comentarios ahora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3496.549s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Deberías haberme avisado.
 Nunca me avisaste.
 Soy el único vecino.
 Nunca lo notificaré.
 Recibo notificaciones de personas del vecindario.
 ¿Sabes lo que hacen?
 Puedes llevarte los bolsillos de la gente.
 No está en tu patio trasero, así que no te molesta.
 Y eso es lo que es todo el asunto.
 Quieres plantas invasoras.
 Has estado cavando cosas y esos tipos destruyeron el lugar y dices que es algo delicado.
 Te permitiría venir a mi propiedad con 510 510 ruedas de piedra y tirarlas allí sin siquiera preguntarme.
 Tenía a la policía allí.
 Dijeron, oye, si rompen el camino de entrada, tienen que arreglarlo.
 ¿Quién permitió eso?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3532.841s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Juan, muchas gracias.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3545.777s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Sí, muchas gracias, Frank Miller.
 Vivo en 56 Grove, así que soy uno de los vecinos que dice John.
 Así que vivo muy cerca del parque, más cerca de lo que vivía John.
 Mi nieto juega allí todo el tiempo.
 Tiene 10 años.
 Lo ha usado ampliamente.
 También veo a otros niños allí, así que sé que se usa.
 Ciertamente la gente también pasea a sus perros allí, pero aparte de eso, sólo un par de cosas.
 Primero que nada, muchas gracias.
 Creo que es una mejora importante.
 Me alegra que estés limpiando todo
 La madera muerta y siempre me preocupa que haya un incendio en ellos debido a toda la madera muerta y los árboles muertos.
 Entonces esa es una gran mejora.
 Y me gusta todo lo que estás haciendo.
 Lo único que me decepciona un poco, porque creo que en el plan inicial dijiste que iban a ser aceras grises y parece que te has alejado de eso.
 Entonces, ¿sigue siendo una posibilidad?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3602.83s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Entonces, hablamos sobre hacer aceras elevadas con el departamento de tránsito y el problema es que implica la instalación de una cuenca colectora, lo que agrega una cantidad monumental de costo.
 Si aún no hay uno allí.
 Y en la mayoría de los casos, no hay ninguno cerca de donde proponemos el cruce de peatones.
 Entonces, en lo que nos estamos enfocando, es en el obstáculo que existe allí.
 Podríamos trabajar con el tráfico para intentar poner otro.
 La otra cosa que habíamos hablado con ellos es tal vez establecer una zona de seguridad a lo largo del borde del parque para que el límite de velocidad, en lugar de ser el de toda la ciudad, 25, fuera más
 como 20 millas por hora.
 Pero sabemos que la gente acelera en esta carretera, que las líneas de visión son un problema y que algunas personas quieren hacerla segura haciendo que la gente reduzca la velocidad.
 Y sí sabemos que es un atajo en el camino para llegar a algunos lugares.
 Yo mismo he pasado por aquí desde otras partes de Medford, pero tal vez hacer que la gente reduzca la velocidad ayude a que sea más seguro.
 Tal vez incluso usarlo con la señalización ayude.
 hazlo un poco más seguro.
 Pero si podemos poner aceras elevadas, lo haremos.
 Pero de lo contrario, haremos lo contrario y simplemente nos aseguraremos de que sea accesible con las rampas a ambos lados.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3705.668s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Vale, hola, Diane Noel.
 Vivo en 11 Newton Road, justo enfrente del parque, One House Inn.
 Creo que estoy de acuerdo con todos los oradores aquí al menos en un sentido, es decir, muchas gracias por esta presentación.
 Estoy realmente impresionado y orgulloso de que estemos analizando la historia de Medford y siendo muy reflexivos al respecto.
 Así que gracias por ese trabajo.
 Haciendo eco de John, me gustaría decir que creo que la conciencia comunitaria es clave.
 Siento que, si no me hubiera suscrito a su boletín y si no estuviera interesado en este tema, no me habría enterado de esta reunión de esta noche.
 Y creo que hay muchas personas interesadas en la comunidad que simplemente no son conscientes de que se están tomando decisiones.
 Entonces no sé si eso significa literalmente como
 Al analizar el vecindario según el punto de John, creo que no hay mucha transparencia en la toma de decisiones y hay mucho interés.
 Uh, mantequillas y miembros de la comunidad que creo que al menos les gustaría tener conciencia, si no la capacidad de, ya sabes, hablar en las reuniones.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3777.742s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: ¿Puedo interrumpir rápidamente y hacer una pregunta para el público en general?
 Para aquellos de ustedes que están aquí, ¿alguno de ustedes recibió una llamada inversa al 911 porque le pedimos a la ciudad que hiciera una hace unas dos semanas y si no se hizo una, sé que la pusieron en el calendario de la ciudad, pero les pedí que lo hicieran?
 una llamada inversa solo para que se corra la voz, sabes, queremos asegurarnos de que sepas que hay otras formas para las personas que conoces, publiqué esto en las redes sociales, la ciudad lo puso en su calendario, pero sí, sabemos que no todos están en Facebook, no todos están en las redes sociales, así que sabes, queremos asegurarnos de capturar a las personas como tú, John, ¿a quién sabrías?, escuchar su teléfono y contestar el mensaje como ese que todos solían hacer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3819.423s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Y recibí uno, pero quiero decir, vivo en el otro extremo de Grove y estoy registrado para recibir las alertas de la ciudad.
 Entonces, ¿están todos registrados para recibir las alertas de la ciudad?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3826.977s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Sí, no conseguí ninguno.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3829.032s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bien, entonces lo comprobaremos porque lo solicitamos específicamente. Quiero decir, sé que se canceló porque lo recibí.
 Pero ¿de qué sirve eso? Quiero decir, estoy dirigiendo una reunión.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3836.496s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Entonces, si pudiera brevemente, si usted está registrado para recibir alertas de la ciudad y no lo hizo y está en esta área y no recibió un mensaje, es posible que no tenga su dirección en el sistema.
 Y eso es algo que hemos estado identificando como un problema.
 Para ello puedes acceder a las alertas en la web de la ciudad.
 Puedes personalizarlo, ya sea tu celular, si es un mensaje de texto, lo puedes recibir en el correo electrónico, lo puedes conseguir en un teléfono fijo en papel, no en papel.
 Pero si no tiene su dirección allí, no recibirá mensajes localizados como este.
 Así que sólo quería que la gente se diera cuenta de eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3876.048s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí, sé que es difícil y sé que ya nadie recibe un trabajo, pero quiero decir, seguro que hay vías, tanto de la vieja escuela como de las redes sociales.
 Sólo sé que es muy difícil concentrarse en estas reuniones y hay tanta gente interesada en este parque, en este vecindario.
 Creo que agradecerían una mayor concienciación.
 Entonces, si pudieras esforzarte un poco más en diferentes vías para al menos
 haz correr la voz.
 Creo que sería útil.
 Quiero reiterar nuevamente a otro comentarista con el cierre de la entrada de Newton Road.
 Obviamente, como persona de Newton Road, realmente extraño eso.
 Realmente hace que ese final del parque sea casi un callejón sin salida.
 para el lado sur, no sólo de acceso, sino también de disfrute.
 No mucha gente irá al medio del parque y luego regresará a esa área, que en realidad era, hasta que la cerraron, la entrada, la entrada para literalmente todos los del lado sur.
 Y escucho la frustración de John y también la frustración del inquilino.
 todos están frustrados.
 Ya sabes, lo queremos de vuelta.
 Queremos que la entrada regrese solo para abrir toda la extensión del parque.
 Entonces sé que es un mensaje bastante consistente que casi todos en el vecindario
 Aparte de quizás john y el derecho a recibir apoyo.
 Pero, ya sabes, simplemente haz una entrada que todos tenían de regreso.
 Y luego, y luego mi, mi, mi comentario, que creo que es único y no uno que se haya dicho hasta ahora.
 Una vez más, creo que la planificación es genial.
 Creo que lo que estás haciendo es genial.
 Mi preocupación siempre es el mantenimiento y el estado futuro.
 Una cosa es tener un hermoso parque hecho y bonitas fotografías, pero como hemos visto, si no tienes un presupuesto o no piensas en mantenerlo,
 Puede volverse bastante malo en muy poco tiempo.
 Entonces, por favor, considere eso mientras planifica que hay una partida en su presupuesto o en su pensamiento sobre cómo mantenerlo lo más hermoso posible el día en que lo haga.
 Así que gracias.
 Gracias, Diana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4024.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Sólo quiero saltar a esa nota.
 Y creo que esta es una buena filosofía que debe tener toda la ciudad.
 Trataría este paisaje como lo haría con un edificio histórico.
 Cuanto más mantenimiento y preservación le hagas, menos requerirá mantenimiento y puesta al día, por así decirlo.
 Entonces, sí, estamos avanzando con la limpieza del parque con la esperanza de que se mantenga limpio, bien mantenido y bien utilizado para que obtenga el presupuesto que merece.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4055.632s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bien, siguiente comentarista, veo a C. Mariano.

 Están pasando muchas cosas.
 Me gusta el plan general.
 Tiene buena pinta.
 Hay muchos árboles Widowmaker por ahí.
 Es como hacer un proyecto en casa, ¿verdad?
 Las banderas arqueológicas todavía están ahí.
 Entonces eso es basura.
 Caminas por esos senderos.
 Estoy en este bosque al menos 30 minutos al día, todos los días.
 Mi hijo y yo salimos y hemos tenido que limpiar todos los vidrios rotos que tiraron los constructores de muros y que están en el camino.
 Todavía no estamos ni cerca.
 Si sales y quieres hacer una acera del lado de Grove, de ese lado, no es lo suficientemente ancha.
 Ahora no vas a tener un camino lo suficientemente ancho.
 Así que el muro debería haber sido empujado hacia atrás en ese punto para aliviar los problemas de John.
 Y estoy de acuerdo, debería haber una entrada sur, 100%.
 Los árboles sobrantes que todavía están allí llevan a todo el vecindario a recorrer todo el camino de Grove para tirar su propia basura allí.
 Se está convirtiendo en un montón de basura una y otra vez.
 Estoy de acuerdo con las especies invasoras.
 Salimos y tiramos mostaza con ajo todo el tiempo.
 Lo hago en cada paseo con perros.
 Tomo mostaza con ajo mientras él huele, ya sabes, y definitivamente hay áreas en las que hemos marcado la diferencia, pero
 Toda esta zona solía ser bastante agradable.
 Ahora hay montones de barro porque el camino es sucio y profundo.
 Hay vidrio.
 No puedo superar la cantidad de vidrio que se rompió con la pared.
 Es ridículo.
 Hay mucho más que se puede hacer.
 Pero para preocupación de todos los demás, este no es un parque público.
 Este es un parque local.
 Esto no será un atractivo para que la gente venga a visitarnos.
 Vivo frente a la pared.
 tal vez cuatro veces al año, veo a alguien detenerse en Grove Street y subir y leer el letrero.
 ¿Usted sabe lo que quiero decir?
 Así que realmente aprecio la idea de mejorarlo, pero creo que solo necesitas medirte a ti mismo cuando se trata de que no será un empate.
 al gran público.
 ¿Usted sabe lo que quiero decir?
 Entonces, lo más importante es el aporte de las personas que lo rodean, ya sea directamente o en las carreteras que lo rodean.
 Quiero decir, si va a haber un jardín de la victoria allí y... El jardín de la victoria está fuera de la mesa.
 Bien, eso es bueno porque hemos estado teniendo conversaciones internas sobre eso porque hemos tenido problemas de ratas en toda el área.
 Entonces, está bien.
 Así que eso era una cosa, pero, ya sabes, el campo apenas se corta, tal vez dos veces al año.
 Incluso de sus muchachos, todavía hay un montón de grava.
 Así que el otro día literalmente saqué la parte inferior de un cono del parque y lo puse a un lado de la carretera, esperando que alguien del pueblo finalmente viniera a recogerlo.
 Porque ha estado ahí desde que se construyó el muro.
 Um, vi una vez en la solución de clics de C, alguien se quejó del vertido allí.
 Y supongo que eso se convirtió en una discusión con quien salió a verlo, pero
 Quiero decir, si no lo haces, si comienzas un proyecto y lo dejas como basura, la gente se dará vuelta y pensará, oh, esto sigue siendo basura.
 Puedo hacer lo que quiera con él.
 Entonces parece que el proyecto se inició, pero no se terminó en la fase uno.
 Ya sabes, con las banderas alrededor de la guardia, es asqueroso estar allí.
 Solía ​​ser mucho más agradable antes de que el muro comenzara a ser honesto contigo.
 Espero que el plan que has trazado llegue a buen término y desaparezca.
 Me encantaría que, ya sabes, espero que todavía esté en el tablero, el puente hacia el parque, porque una vez más, la gente tiene que caminar hasta arriba.
 Los niños tienen que recorrer toda la calle Grove y rodearla.
 Te diré esto, Mike, hay una valla caída.
 Mi hijo cruza las vías del tren, ya sabes, porque es casi más seguro que subir y doblar la esquina de Grove para bajar al centro de juegos.
 Ya sabes, esas son mis preocupaciones.
 Hay muchos de ellos.
 Debería haber hecho una lista, pero probablemente me tomaría 30 minutos.
 Pero definitivamente involucraría más a los lugareños, ya sabes, porque si no vives por aquí, no vendrás a este parque.
 Ya sabes, esto no es un aparcamiento.
 Esto no es un chupetón.
 Esto no es nada de eso.
 Entonces.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4334.142s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muchas gracias y no dudes en enviarnos un correo electrónico si piensas en más cosas.
 Ya sabes, esta es una conversación continua.
 Y tengo un punto más.
 Espera, Juan.
 John, lo necesito, tengo otras personas que han levantado la mano, así que me gustaría dejar un comentario.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4351.289s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Rapidísimo.
 Diane estaba hablando de su hijo caminando por el camino de entrada y trayendo a la gente que caminaba hasta allí.
 ¿Cómo se sentiría alguien más si viviera allí?
 Y tenían hijos, y había gente caminando por su camino de entrada.
 Mi privacidad está dentro.
 ¿Y por qué no cierran el muro y ponen la abertura en medio de la calle?
 No entiendo por qué simplemente no hacen eso.
 Cierra ese muro mañana y ábrelo en Grove Street.
 Y esa acera, como si tuviera razón, esa acera no es lo suficientemente ancha para hacer esa acera.
 Y el muro fue un trabajo terrible, y hay un desastre ahí dentro.
 Y es más ruidoso que antes, porque toda esa basura está fuera de allí.
 Necesitan volver a la fase 1.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4392.777s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Gracias, Juan.
 Muchas gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4397.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Antes de que la gente intervenga, permítanme ofrecerles algunas aclaraciones, que pueden ayudar.
 Entonces, en la discusión sobre cerrar ese extremo, hay un par de cosas diferentes.
 No pudimos poner un cruce de peatones allí porque ya existe un cruce de peatones.
 No queremos que la gente cruce por el lugar de entrada.
 Pero más allá de eso,
 Queremos, como mencioné antes, concentrar a la gente en el cruce principal de Jackson Road, por lo que se necesita la acera.
 Hay cinco pies a lo largo de toda la pared.
 En realidad, hay más que eso en algunos lugares, pero hay cinco pies.
 La acera ADA debe tener 48 pulgadas, desde la pared hasta la acera y 36 pulgadas de espacio libre.
 Tenemos eso.
 Lo medimos el otro día mientras estábamos en el
 parque.
 En términos de costo, analizamos el costo de volver a abrir el muro o el costo de ampliar la acera.
 La acera hasta Jackson Road es infinitamente más barata, alrededor de $ 10,000.
 Iba a costar algo parecido a
 $36,000 para lograr que el contratista regrese, se movilice, abra el muro, retire la acera, retraiga los muros y tenga esa apertura.
 Costará alrededor de $20,000 o menos, dependiendo de cuánto se relacione con el proyecto más grande, colocar la acera, colocar el corte en la acera, colocar el paso de peatones e identificar.
 Así que simplemente estamos tratando de sopesar los pros y los contras de ambos.
 comentarios públicos versus también asegurarnos de que seamos fiscalmente responsables con la cantidad de dinero que recibimos en impuestos.
 Pero repito, todo esto está sujeto a discusión.
 Todos, es una opinión.
 Entonces el tráfico podría decir de repente: no, no hagas eso.
 Volvamos a la idea de poner la pared y lo haremos.
 Pero, ya sabes, también tenemos que proporcionar las comodidades de la ADA para asegurarnos de que el parque sea accesible, porque hemos recibido, ya sabes, hemos recibido comentarios de que la gente quiere usar el parque, y estamos obligados.
 Y como parte de ese trabajo previo, queríamos decir que si vamos a abrir y cerrar entradas, todas serán accesibles.
 El parque será universalmente accesible para todos, ya sabes, e incluso si no lo utilizan personas de otras partes de la comunidad, está ahí para que pueda serlo.
 Bien.
 Así que creo que el consenso general es que, aunque el público no venga a verlo, está disponible para ellos si quieren hacerlo.
 Ciertamente no se puede hacer que alguien o que alguien venga a ello.
 Pero ya sabes, yo.
 Ustedes, como vecinos, ciertamente queremos que esto funcione para ustedes, pero también debemos asegurarnos de que estamos haciendo todo lo posible para que funcione para toda la ciudad también.
 Este es, ya sabes, M-Belt y la Casa Real tienen sus propias pequeñas ubicaciones, pero este es realmente el único parque de la ciudad que celebra alguna parte de la historia.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4565.828s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Benjamin O'Cady, puedes hacer tu comentario.
 Si podemos conseguir su nombre y dirección para que conste en acta, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4572.062s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Hola soy Olga, Katie, soy la esposa de Benjamín.
 Tengo un par de comentarios que me gustaría compartir.
 Y estamos en 38 Jackson Road.
 Así que gracias por esta presentación.
 Y es obvio que has tomado en serio muchos aportes de la comunidad al diseñar la presentación y regresar con otra interpretación para la fase dos.
 Así que agradezco que escuchen tan atentamente a la comunidad, especialmente a aquellos de nosotros que usamos el parque todos los días y estamos
 actores muy activos en su preservación y utilidad para los miembros de esta comunidad.
 Los comentarios que tengo se relacionan específicamente con la planificación de árboles para el parque y la barrera del sonido y su mantenimiento.
 Entonces, lo que hemos notado, mi esposo y yo, en los últimos tres años que hemos vivido aquí, es que desde que se completó la fase uno, la barrera del sonido ha sido completamente destruida.
 El ruido del tren es
 Es ridículo y nuestra casa tiembla.
 Como si hubiera un mini terremoto ocurriendo varias veces al día debido al temblor como resultado de los árboles que fueron derribados para la restauración del muro de la primera parte.
 Así que estoy muy preocupado por los árboles adicionales que se talarán en fases posteriores del proyecto porque, aunque se plantarán algunos nuevos, es de esperar que el cronograma no coincida porque el tiempo que tardarán esos árboles en madurar hasta el nivel
 De los árboles que se talan actualmente serán 20, 30 años.
 Entonces, antes de que puedan ser una barrera del sonido efectiva, pasará bastante tiempo.
 Y mientras tanto, el ruido de los trenes es ridículo.
 El temblor es terrible en cuanto a la destrucción de la barrera del sonido que ocurrió.
 Y está causando problemas con los cimientos y simplemente externalidades negativas adicionales en las que probablemente no hayas pensado inicialmente al diseñar este proyecto.
 Así que creo que es necesario adoptar otras medidas.
 Se han tomado medidas para reducir el efecto de barrera del sonido al derribar árboles adicionales y cualquier árbol que se plante debe crecer muy rápido para reemplazar esa barrera del sonido.
 lo más rápido posible.
 La segunda preocupación que tengo es con respecto al mantenimiento de esos árboles.
 Específicamente, ¿quién maneja esos proyectos?
 ¿Será el Departamento Forestal de Medford?
 ¿Será un arbolista privado?
 ¿Hay dinero reservado para regar esos árboles, los árboles nuevos, y asegurarse de que sobrevivan?
 Porque muchos de los árboles plantados en Medford, los árboles nuevos, en primer lugar, tardan una eternidad en ser plantados por cuestiones que no vamos a discutir hoy, pero además no hay mantenimiento de esos árboles porque nadie los riega porque no hay dinero.
 Por lo tanto, cualquier árbol nuevo que se plante básicamente necesita ser cuidado durante al menos tres años de forma regular para asegurarse de que sobreviva.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4741.324s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Sí, entonces,
 Ya sabes, mientras intento pensar en buenas ideas para la barrera del sonido, ya sabes, y tal vez tenga sentido encontrar una manera de ajardinar el borde a lo largo del lado del ferrocarril con más arbustos bajos que disipen el ruido en todo el parque.
 Y, ya sabes, tal vez podríamos hacer que el presupuesto del árbol llegue más lejos.
 De esa manera, eso es algo que ciertamente podemos discutir con Peter, que es arquitecto paisajista, quien sin duda podría ayudar y analizar eso.
 Y podemos abordar eso.
 Podemos intentar mirar eso.
 La valla de la MBTA, como alguien mencionó, está caída.
 Queremos asegurarnos de que eso vuelva a funcionar una vez finalizado el trabajo del árbol.
 Hecho para que ya no haya un cruce inseguro allí porque los trenes, una vez terminada la construcción, van a comenzar.
 Ya sabes, regresar a toda velocidad y no todos se detienen por allí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4806.644s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Así que odiaría intervenir un poco, pero mi hijo y yo podemos dar fe de esto porque ella se burló de mí en el pasado, pero.
 De hecho, hemos tratado de limpiar desde la izquierda de Poms Walter Ravine al costado del camino y detrás de él, y de hecho quitamos las malas hierbas y entramos y plantamos flores nativas, como un jardín de tipo polinizado real en ese lado.
 Todo lo que hay en la parte delantera y trasera de esa pared es una pizca de tierra, no tierra, tierra, con nada más que roca debajo.
 El simple hecho de que tengamos amigos que donen diferentes lirios y diferentes bulbos este año que intentamos plantar en la parte posterior de la pared, ya sabes, junto a, si conoces el área, hay un árbol, como una pequeña joroba detrás de la izquierda de la pared.
 Pero una cosa a tener en cuenta es definitivamente el riego, porque no estoy seguro de si alguno de ellos va a aguantar.
 Mis semillas, puse $60 en semillas este año, $80 en semillas el año pasado.
 Tenemos algunos que tomaron, pero odio decir el término, porque a algunas personas no les gusta, no sé quién está aquí, pero con el cambio climático, ha sido un invierno muy caluroso y seco.
 Si vives aquí, sabes de dónde viene ese sol.
 El sol no necesariamente incide directamente en esa zona.
 Y allí está súper, súper seco y no es tierra.
 No hay suelo.
 a cada lado de esa pared directamente.
 Una vez que estás adentro o en el pasado, hay una tonelada de tierra llena de malezas.
 Pero si vas a hacer algo decorativo, como lirios o lo que sea que fueran esas plantas, alguien tiene que encargarse de ello, especialmente con las plantaciones de árboles.
 Entonces no hay agua directa allí.
 Literalmente he considerado preguntarles a mis vecinos para poder usar su casa en la esquina y pasar una manguera desde su casa al otro lado de la calle.
 Creo que a estas alturas simplemente no tiene sentido.
 Y la maleza es ridícula por todas partes.
 Quiero decir, la ciudad viene una vez al año en otoño y la hierba lo destruye todo.
 De hecho, tenía un jardín que estaba creciendo el año pasado y vinieron y desyerbaron todo.
 Entonces, sí.
 Pero eso es todo.
 Sólo quiero señalar eso.
 Algo más tendrás que presupuestar si estás pensando en hacer eso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4942.083s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muchas gracias.
 Gracias Olga también por esos comentarios y definitivamente volveremos a revisar el plan de paisajismo, los árboles y el mantenimiento.
 Hice una lista aquí y, para que sepas, consultaremos con Peter y algunos de nuestros compañeros para hablar sobre eso y pensar más profundamente al respecto.
 Así que muchas gracias.
 Gracias.
 Bien, a continuación veo el BNIC.
 Si pudiera activar su silencio y darnos su nombre y dirección para que conste.
 Hola BNIC.
 ¿Quieres hacer un comentario?
 Tienes la mano levantada.
 No podemos oírte si estás intentando hablar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5002.169s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Se reactivaron ellos mismos, pero no podemos oírlos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5007.312s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bien, pasaré a la siguiente persona y volveré contigo.
 Diane, si quieres hacerlo, vi tu mano levantada otra vez.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5014.375s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sí, sí, solo quería abordar el comentario de Ryan sobre hacer un análisis de costos para qué era, una acera versus una pared.
 Y nuevamente, volviendo a recibir comentarios, creo que si hubieran preguntado antes de cerrar el muro de Newton Road, podríamos haberles ahorrado $36,000.
 Bien.
 Así que esa es una frustración que creo que muchos de nosotros abordaremos.
 También creo que si le preguntas a la comunidad, ¿cuál preferirías?
 Creo que todos diríamos que preferiríamos esa entrada a gastar el dinero.
 En otras palabras, comuníquese con la comunidad y obtenga volúmenes reales de respuestas, no solo los 20 que tenemos la suerte de haber encontrado esta reunión.
 Haz una encuesta en Google, haz algo en lo que realmente obtengas consenso antes de tomar decisiones.
 Sabes, no te pedimos que cortaras ese acceso.
 Lo hiciste.
 Y ahora te pedimos que lo devuelvas.
 Y estás diciendo que sería costoso, pero no es algo que deberías haber hecho en primer lugar.
 Esa es una verdadera frustración que creo que todos compartimos.
 Así que escuche y busque la opinión amplia de la comunidad antes de tomar decisiones como esa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5104.873s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Gracias, Diana.</p>

 No dudes en hacer tu comentario.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5211.993s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sí.
 Hola, Jen.
 Y yo, ya sabes, estoy realmente de acuerdo con muchos de los miembros de nuestra comunidad y escucho la frustración de John y la de Diane y
 Creo que debería haber acceso en el lado sur de Grove Street que no interfiera obviamente con los derechos personales y la propiedad personal de alguien.
 Entonces los escucho alto y claro.
 Sabes, John, sé que has estado aquí durante mucho tiempo, pero yo también he estado aquí durante más de 20 años.
 Sabes, no soy un novato en esta comunidad y no es solo un parque para perros.
 Vemos muchos niños entrando y saliendo de allí.
 Disfruto del parque.
 Sé que hay, ya sabes,
 Reticencia al cambio para muchos de nosotros, ¿verdad?
 Nos hacemos mayores y llegamos a un punto de nuestras vidas en el que no queremos ver muchos cambios.
 Pero para mí, nos veo sentados en un vecindario donde tenemos acceso real a algo histórico.
 Y tampoco busco inundar nuestro vecindario con autobuses y un grupo de niños en edad escolar, o una afluencia masiva de personas en el público.
 Pero al mismo tiempo, hay una historia aquí y creo que debemos valorarla.
 Entonces, mi pensamiento es, ya sabes, hagámoslo como creo que la gente lo está haciendo de una manera cuidadosa, reflexiva y con mentalidad comunitaria, sin tratar de introducir mucho tráfico innecesario.
 Pero al mismo tiempo, ésta es un área que podría ser útil para
 Sabes que a los niños de la escuela de Brooks les gusta caminar por la calle y hacer un recorrido a pie un día en la primavera, donde entienden un poco más sobre la historia de esta área, lo cual creo que es muy valioso para que aprendan.
 Y yo, entre muchas personas, tal vez en la llamada no quiero que la historia se olvide.
 Quiero que se aprecie la historia, y creo que hay algunas cosas realmente interesantes sobre la construcción del barco y el uso del mismo.
 canal y otras cosas similares que podrían ser de verdadero valor.
 Eso es todo lo que tengo que decir, pero aprecio el cuidado y la consideración de todo esto.
 Pero tampoco tengo la misma preocupación por el cambio, siempre y cuando refleje que la comunidad y la gente comprendan que aquí hay una parte real de la historia que se puede contar y explorar de una manera segura y modesta.
 Aprecio que todos hagan lo que están haciendo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5346.996s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Gracias, Támara.
 ¿Hay alguien más que no ha hablado y que le gustaría hacerlo?

 ¿Hay alguien que quiera hablar?
 ¿Hay alguien más a quien le gustaría hacer un comentario?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5378.95s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: ¿Hola?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5388.638s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Hola, Bill Stevens, Wellgate Road.
 Muchas gracias.
 Adelante.
 Como todo el mundo, vivo aquí desde hace unos 30 años.
 Estoy un poco preocupado porque creo que ustedes se han adelantado a todo este proyecto sin hablar con los vecinos o los residentes de esta comunidad.
 A mí también me gustan los espacios verdes.
 Me gustan los lagos místicos.
 Me gusta este pequeño parque que tenemos allí.
 No soy partidario del cambio, pero veo lo que están tratando de hacer para que el parque sea más accesible para personas en sillas de ruedas y personas discapacitadas, pero creo
 Nadie ha pensado realmente en dónde se puede estacionar una camioneta ADA o el tipo de vehículo en las calles laterales que ha propuesto.
 Miro los planos y hasta ahora he visto dos plazas de aparcamiento en las calles laterales.
 ¿Alguien puede explicarme cómo creen que pueden estacionar una camioneta ADA en la calle lateral y permitir el acceso con una silla de ruedas dentro y fuera?
 ¿Alguien ha pensado antes de este proyecto que realmente ha avanzado con las aceras ADA?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5452.147s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Entonces, el siguiente paso para nosotros es tomar el diseño esquemático que tenemos y trabajar con un ingeniero a través del departamento de tráfico, DPW y el departamento de planificación, y profundizar realmente en los detalles de esa misma pregunta.
 Ya sabes, ¿cómo sería factible o no?
 estacionar una camioneta o un vehículo ADA en la calle o en el sitio, ya sabes, en algún lugar, ¿verdad?
 Entonces esos detalles... Pones al policía antes que al marido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5489.141s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Hemos tenido todas estas conversaciones y todas estas leyes de zonificación y cambios en los estatutos, y ustedes realmente no han descubierto qué tan accesible será este parque para las personas discapacitadas.
 Así que estamos cambiando toda la narrativa al permitir que los autos se estacionen en el parque.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5507.249s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Bueno, la comunidad nos pidió que no permitiéramos autos en el parque, pero ciertamente... No se puede estacionar en una calle lateral.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5512.773s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Necesitamos 96 pulgadas de ancho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5514.875s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Correcto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5515.315s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Entonces, una de las cosas que ciertamente... No se puede dejar caer una rampa desde el costado de una camioneta hacia la acera.
 Esa es la pasarela de un residente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5525.148s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Bueno, no lo estoy, no estoy seguro porque tendríamos que pedirle a un ingeniero que lo revise, pero eso es parte del próximo proceso ahora que hemos obtenido la financiación para tener los diseños.
 Preparados para que luego al menos podamos mostrárselos a la comunidad para que tengamos esas respuestas específicas.
 Ya sabes, esto es sólo el.
 El inicio de esta fase funciona, ¿no?
 Y, por supuesto, la atención se centrará en cuidar el tema de la seguridad, los árboles, ya sabes, y la arqueología que no afecte más a ninguno de estos otros.
 No diría, ya sabes, temas más debatidos, ¿verdad?
 Entonces, para esos temas discutibles, tenemos.
 ya sabes, al menos seis meses antes de que salgamos a licitar o a construir.
 Entonces, pero queremos avanzar rápido, ¿verdad?
 Entonces, tan pronto como tengamos esos diseños, podremos presentarlos a la comunidad para recibir sus comentarios.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5580.401s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Y luego... Terminemos un minuto.
 ¿Qué pasa si esos diseños no funcionan?
 Hemos gastado tres años y más de dinero en equipo en un proyecto que no puede avanzar.
 Entonces, ¿qué puede ser viable primero antes de dedicar todo este tiempo y energía a seguir adelante?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5595.956s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Así que no se trata de si funciona o no.
 Es cuestión de hacer que algo funcione.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5601.962s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Entonces vivo aquí durante 30 años.
 He visto a las autoridades de estacionamiento en esa calle.
 he visto
 La policía intenta reducir la velocidad en la carretera, pones topes y esa carretera es como una autopista.
 Viajo por ese camino 15 veces al día yendo y viniendo al trabajo, llevo a mis hijos al trabajo y bajo al tren.
 El camino es una autopista.
 Has puesto estos carteles, badenes, nada controla la velocidad.
 Sí, pensar realmente que puedes reducir la velocidad del camino para que alguien vaya allí en silla de ruedas,
 alguien va a morir.
 Y no creo que ustedes hayan pensado mucho en esto en absoluto.
 Son todos rincones ciegos.
 Entonces, antes de seguir adelante, me gustaría realmente considerarlo antes de gastar más dinero de los impuestos del que realmente necesito en este proyecto.
 Sé que es una subvención.
 Sé cómo funciona todo eso.
 Sé que esta ciudad está sufriendo por los trabajadores de mantenimiento.
 No tenemos ningún plan de mantenimiento en el presupuesto para esta propiedad.
 Me hago eco de la mujer que habla de los árboles.
 En el barrio, cada árbol cae frente a cada casa.
 Cada casa tiene árboles podridos.
 Este es un terreno abandonado.
 Simplemente creo que ustedes se están apresurando en este proyecto, especialmente con las disposiciones sobre discapacidad de esta ley.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5683.977s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Gracias bill.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5703.545s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Sí, soy Bobby Nicotero en 3 Newton Road y he estado aquí desde siempre.
 La casa vibra desde el tren como a la una de la madrugada.
 algunas noches, y así, quiero decir, todo lo que todos han tocado aquí, disculpen, lo he experimentado directa o indirectamente, y debo decir que mi esposa hizo un comentario interesante cuando nos mudamos aquí en el 93.
 Ella dijo: Bob, crecí en Medford, fui a Medford High,
 Pensé que lo sabía todo sobre Method, pero ni siquiera conocía Rose Street, nunca había estado aquí antes.
 Y no podrías tener más razón.
 Ésta es una situación extremadamente local, local aquí.
 Y somos muy sensibles al respecto porque vivimos, yo vivo justo al lado.
 Y he visto todas las cosas que la gente ha mencionado.
 Y sería una pena que cambiara, para ser honesto, porque es el encanto que este parque y este vecindario aportan a la gente que vive aquí.
 Y a la gente le encanta estar aquí.
 Todos lo hacen.
 Es una gran comunidad.
 Pero primero, John no podría haber tenido más razón.
 Necesitaba que dos de mis vecinos me contaran sobre la reunión de esta noche, así que no me notificaron por alguna razón.
 No culpo a nadie.
 es solo eso
 Estamos en 2024, así que sé que esto debería habérsele dado al menos a la gente de Grove, y esos son mejores.
 Pero repito, es un parque local.
 Aprecio la historia.
 Nunca habría sabido nada de Sagamore Park a menos que mis hijos vagaran por las calles con sus amigos y descubrieran que había indios nativos en esta parte del país.
 Muy interesante sobre la historia, y eso nos encanta.
 Pero hay un encanto y un amor por la historia a su alrededor.
 Y la gente responde muy bien a todo ello.
 Pero debo decir que Grove Street es como un guante para el exceso de velocidad.
 Parece que los coches aceleran o frenan a un ritmo rápido.
 Desafortunadamente, un perro fue atropellado por un automóvil y murió no hace mucho en Grove.
 Y fue muy, muy triste.
 Y llegó a casa.
 Y, sabes, siempre tuve miedo de que mis hijos estuvieran caminando por Grove y mi perro saliera corriendo hacia Grove por miedo a, ya sabes, los autos que viajaban.
 Escucharás un estallido y cosas que caen de un camión cuando se detiene en el badén.
 Entonces, todas estas cosas juntas, y luego tienes un parque y más personas estacionando, viajando y visitando.
 Ya sabes, la acera es estrecha.
 No hay duda.
 Si cruzo la calle por esa acera, frente a mi casa en Grove, ese camino de tierra, parece, supongo que técnicamente podría parecer ancho, pero no se siente ancho cuando los autos pasan volando a tu lado.
 Es muy, muy peligroso.
 Esa es la mayor preocupación que tengo allí.
 Y es una calle muy transitada, Newton y Grove.
 Es una intersección muy transitada.
 O los camiones son nuevos y circulan por allí entregando cosas.
 La gente da vuelta allí todo el tiempo, los conductores de Uber dan vuelta en esa esquina.
 Estoy de acuerdo en que es un viaje local.
 Sí creo que deberían haber repensado esa entrada a lo grande.
 Porque si lo repensaran y recibieran muchas más aportaciones, quiero decir, todos estarían tan confundidos acerca de esa entrada como yo.
 Y debería haber estado bien, muy bien pensado.
 Y debería haber habido muchos más aportes porque es algo local.
 Y yo digo gastar el dinero.
 El dinero gastado ahora no es nada, unos centavos, comparado con lo que podría llegar a ser.
 Así que, por supuesto, gasta el dinero.
 Gastarlo sabiamente.
 La última vez que lo comprobé, no se mueve tan rápido.
 Entonces, cuando lo configuras, es para siempre.
 Y es histórico.
 Por eso es muy importante hacerlo correctamente.
 Así que yo también me veo directamente afectado, como todos.
 Todos hemos estado aquí por un tiempo.
 Todos hemos invertido mucho esfuerzo en nuestros hogares aquí y nos encanta estar aquí.
 Por eso recomiendo repensar esa apertura cerca de la casa de John.
 John trabaja mucho en su casa y cuida bien su propiedad.
 Haz algo con el ruido.
 Cuando estás en el patio, básicamente hace años antes de COVID, todo lo que escuchas es que siempre escuchas un autobús, un tren,
 un avión cuando estás en tu patio trasero aquí.
 Entonces, cualquier cosa que puedas hacer para utilizar los árboles y arbustos de plantas sería fantástico.
 Y quiero decir, eso es básicamente, pero la velocidad es como un guante en Newton y Grove y ese es el elemento más importante para mí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6000.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Gracias bobby.
 Muchas gracias.
 Y me alegro de que hayamos escuchado tu comentario.
 Muchas gracias.
 Elyse, eres la siguiente.
 Nombre y dirección para que conste en acta, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6009.428s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sí, Elyse Jennings, 94 Grove Street, justo enfrente del muro de esclavos.
 Gracias por celebrar esta reunión y por toda la información.
 Estoy de acuerdo con muchas de las cosas que se han dicho.
 Me despierto pensando que hay un terremoto muchas noches desde que se hizo ese trabajo.
 Pero sólo quería plantear un punto que aún no había surgido.
 Ah, y por cierto, soy dueño de un perro y tengo un niño pequeño en Grove Street.
 Pero quería plantear el tema de los pasos de peatones.
 Bueno, entiendo la necesidad de accesibilidad y probablemente sería útil reducir la velocidad del tráfico.
 Sólo me preocupan las monstruosidades de muchos carteles o luces intermitentes.
 No sé cómo serán estos cruces de peatones.
 No sé cuántos necesitamos realmente.
 Así que sólo quería plantear ese punto porque aún no lo había escuchado.
 Y también quería hacerse eco de la difusión de la información.
 Escuché de un vecino que sabe que vivo aquí y me contó sobre esto y que tengo la suerte de conocer a algunos de los vecinos porque he estado aquí durante ocho años, pero tenemos algunos vecinos más nuevos con los que aún no están tan conectados.
 Por eso, sería muy bueno si pudieran obtener más fácilmente la información de que se están llevando a cabo estas reuniones y de que se están haciendo estos planes.
 Luego solo un pequeño comentario sobre cuándo se colocaron el muro de esclavos y todos los demás muros.
 Nuevamente, hablando del tema de las monstruosidades, había un orinal portátil que estaba justo enfrente de nosotros.
 Los autos se detendrían y la gente usaría el orinal portátil.
 Estuvo allí durante meses después de que el trabajo estuvo terminado, o al menos semanas después de que el trabajo estuvo terminado.
 No sé si el próximo trabajo incluirá un orinal portátil, pero solo para
 Para conectarlo y tal vez asegurarnos de que se administre bien para que no necesitemos estar allí por más tiempo del que dura el trabajo.
 Y sí, esos son sólo los comentarios que quería hacer.
 Gracias.
 Muchas gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6140.425s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Por cierto, por allí, quienquiera que haya ido y haya grapado la información de la reunión.
 postes de electricidad, gracias, así es como me enteré, estaba paseando a mi perro y alguien había grapado el letrero allí, así que gracias.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6162.239s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sí, también me enteré por una vecina, por Diane en realidad, desafortunadamente no por la ciudad.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6171.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: ¿Hay algún otro comentario de alguien que quisiera hacer esta noche antes de concluir?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6176.912s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: No, pero quiero dejar claro que si las personas tienen lugares a los que van en busca de información, sería mejor que cuando nos envíen un correo electrónico simplemente nos digan, ya saben, si tienen un lugar al que ir, por ejemplo, intentamos vomitarlo en la puerta de al lado y.
 Uh, ya sabes, y hace años solía haber foros de chat de Yahoo en los que participaba todo el mundo.
 Pero, ya sabes, si hay algo así ahora, estaremos felices de intentar aprovechar esos recursos para asegurarnos de aprovechar todos los disponibles.
 Y Jen, tal vez podamos intentarlo, ya sabes, si avanzamos con el trabajo de diseño o lo que sea, si tenemos otra reunión, tal vez puedas salir con la factura de impuestos y, ya sabes, eso afectará.
 Al menos la casa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6217.961s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sí, creo que hablé con Dennis sobre la factura del agua.
 Es simplemente difícil.
 Como si tuvieras que acertar con el correo.
 Y ya sabes, desafortunadamente, realmente no tenemos un presupuesto, tenemos que trabajar con la ciudad para, ya sabes, intentar hacer un envío por correo.
 Entonces, pero los escuchamos y veremos qué podemos hacer y trataremos de que funcione.
 Y tratar de conseguirlo, ya sabes, tal vez hagamos algunos lanzamientos de puertas,
 puedes caminar por el vecindario.
 Propondremos algunas ideas y realmente apreciamos los comentarios de todos esta noche.
 Y nuevamente, envíenos un correo electrónico a la comisión si tiene alguna idea después de esta reunión.
 Este no es, ciertamente no es el final del proceso.
 Este es el comienzo o la mitad y agradecemos los comentarios.
 Si desea estar en nuestra lista de correo, envíenos su, si nos envía un correo electrónico, nos aseguraremos de que esté en nuestra lista.
 Y siempre estamos abiertos a recibir comentarios, sugerencias.
 Así que gracias como siempre.
 Gracias a todos por venir esta noche.
 Gracias por permanecer aquí durante más de 90 minutos y nos vemos la próxima vez.
 Muchas gracias.
 Qué tengas buenas noches.</p>
