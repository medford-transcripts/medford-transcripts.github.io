    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=0.531s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 很快，我们将回顾 2020 年制定的公园总体规划。
 我们将总结第一阶段目前已经完成的工作。
 这包括 Pomp Wall 修复、Fieldstone Wall 修复和考古挖掘，我知道你们中的一些人来看并参与了这些工作，所以谢谢你们。
 我们有一个新的总体规划更新。
 因此，从我们的考古挖掘中，我们收到了一些需要实施的建议。
 这确实是我们想与社区分享的今晚表演的关键。
 这将真正有助于为我们所说的公园工作第三阶段建设管道。
 所以我们已经完成了第一阶段，在接下来的几个月里我们将开始第二阶段，现在我们正在建设第三阶段的管道，这就是我们所说的历史步行道，一些标志，一些历史地标。
 再说一遍，这些只是我们今晚要与您分享的概念。
 我们尚未获得此阶段的资金，仍在寻求社区反馈。
 但在某些方面，你知道，我们正在开始第二阶段，我们必须考虑第三阶段。我们只是想继续推进一些总体规划的事情。
 然后我们会在最后回来讨论第二阶段和未来的工作，我知道你们中的许多人可能会对此感到兴奋，并且我们已经为此获得了资金。
 我们即将开始向供应商发送一些 RFP，该工作预计将完成。
 明年的第一部分。
 最后我们会提出意见、问题和意见。
 我们恳请您在回答问题或评论之前先完成演示，以便每个人都有机会在最后谈论他们当时想要的任何内容。
 因此，从现在开始，我将把发言权交给 Ryan Hayward 和 Peter Hedlund，他们将讨论演示的主要内容。
 伙计们，明白了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=149.076s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you, Jen, for that introduction, and I think Ryan's going to get the.
 Presentation up on the screen.
 Great.
 Thanks, Ryan.
 So everybody should be looking at just the title slide here.
 My name is Peter Headland, a landscape architect and a planner based in Arlington right next door.
 I was fortunate enough to work on the master plan project and have now been doing a little study on this concept design.
 And we'll talk about that shortly here.
 Okay, next slide.
 Great.
 The 2020 master plan, we started in 2019.
 It was almost a year process.
 It went through 2020.
 And that's all on the historical commission website.
 And at the end of that, we came up with a series of phased implementation projects that could happen over a period of
 20 years, and we'll talk about the first phase of that with the next slide.
 So this shows the first, say, seven of these implementation ideas that came out of the master plan, restoring the wall, the historic wall right on the edge of Grove Street.
 an archaeological dig at the estate, which has also taken place.
 We'll talk about that a little bit.
 Making improvements to the Grove Street edge, the fieldstone wall there.
 Those were in phase one and we'll go over those in a little bit.
 Other projects
 from the master planning include new crosswalks, improvements to the trails, some type of signage to identify the park, and some planting in this central planted LA.
 Okay, on the next slide, we'll talk about that.
 The first step and really the reason for this whole park is what's now known as Pomp's Wall.
 In 2019, the image on the upper left, that was the condition when we began the master plan and we had a historic masonry consultant, Richard Irons, come and maybe some of you heard him talk.
 He gave a presentation a number of years ago.
 He evaluated the wall.
 I wrote up a pretty detailed technical memo about the wall and went over some options to restore the wall.
 Some of you might know that a wall that part of the, in the deed when this part was given to the city of Medford, it stipulated that this wall, they were so proud of this wall, that this wall needed to be forever maintained.
 The preservation and restoration of this wall is really important or else technically, the old estate could take this part back over, but luckily, that's not going to happen.
 The middle slide there shows the previous joint conditions, pretty deteriorated and the capstone needed some significant repair.
 So, in the next slide, we show the process in 2023.
 Mason was hired to do that work.
 This is that restoration.
 A lot of the wall really had to be taken apart and put back together.
 And maybe some of you.
 were there or witnessed some of that progress.
 And the brick on the right side is pretty interesting.
 The contractor pulled that out and you can see a fingerprints on the top of that brick.
 So that's
 Pretty interesting, the wall was said to have been built in 1760, and so those are over 250 years old.
 Were they from Pompeii, the former enslaved person who built the wall?
 Perhaps Medford was known for local brick making and these bricks were sourced locally, but that's really sort of a neat glimpse of history and all those bricks went back into that wall.
 On the next slide, you can see the final result from last year of the newly restored wall with newly pointed bricks.
 They ended up putting a new cap on top of it to really seal that with flashing.
 Hopefully, this will last for the next few generations.
 Okay, so the next project that came out of the master plan in phase 1 was improving the Grove Street edge, the old field stone wall.
 It's an interesting historic image on the right hand side of the screen here, which shows it's looking up Grove Street.
 That is the
 historic wall, formerly known as the slave wall, now known as Pompe's wall.
 And you can see the wall as it was historically, but over time, it had sort of fallen apart in some areas more than others.
 The image on the left here is showing prior to the master plan, you know, the
 wall in this area was pretty gone, and so the thought there was to improve this fieldstone wall.
 And so the next slide shows the results of that.
 With the wall repaired, it really helps to define the edge of the park.
 Also, cutouts were left at intersections for crosswalks to access the park.
 And...
 Another part of that project was for five feet behind that wall, clearing out the understory, a lot of invasive plants have popped up in there.
 Clearing that out a little bit, let these big trees, you can see this one over on the right side, give them a little bit more room to grow.
 Ryan, at the end, we'll talk a little bit about some upcoming planting maintenance improvements.
 Okay, on the next slide, we talk about the third part of this first phase of projects coming out of the master plan, the archaeological dig at the estate.
 Here we see illustration of the Thomas Brooks house that was right behind that wall.
 This later colored here, that's that wall, that's Pomp's Wall.
 You can see the drive right behind it and what this house looked like.
 It was built in 1727.
 The house was demolished in 1860.
 Then it just really sat there because it was never redeveloped and became a park.
 The archaeologists we brought on for the master plan were determined, and they were correct, that this is a highly sensitive area for archaeological findings.
 And the master plan proposed an archaeological dig
 with a professional and to work collaboratively with community volunteers, and that happened.
 And they thought that there was the possibility to find, very good possibility to find both pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.
 And on the next slide, we see that dig, which happened in 2022 and 23.
 Maybe some people on this call, this Zoom meeting were part of that.
 You can see some of the people from the community along with the professionals working on that dig.
 There were 23 test pits and over 1,600 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 And post-contact and pre-contact mean either pre-contact is pre-colonial settlement and post-contact is after settlers arrived.
 So there was both interesting findings from both of those areas, which is pretty neat.
 And here's some of the things that were found.
 That piece of pottery was on that site.
 Okay, next slide please Ryan.
 So there is a pretty detailed survey report from the master plan that made some recommendations.
 They recommended to protect and preserve this site, specifically this estate site area.
 They thought it was a highly sensitive area in and around the house site, and that in this area, that any below ground disturbance should be avoided or ideally kept at a real minimum.
 And that will come into play when we talk about the concept for this area.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan.
 We see where that area is.
 This is the approximate house location.
 We're looking south on the dirt path.
 You can kind of see the back of Pomp's wall there.
 So that's generally where that house was.
 On the next slide, we have a couple images looking both south on that site.
 Some low vinca has grown up there.
 Maybe,
 A remnant from ground cover that was planted originally that could be possible.
 And then this is looking north.
 It was a pretty open site originally around that estate, but trees have have grown in over time.
 Okay, and the next slide.
 We see a couple other just context views of the north entrance.
 This is the newly reconstructed wall and the break in the wall at the roadway opposite.
 This is looking south on the south approach and you can see the open lawn there.
 These are the two ways that visitors would get to this area.
 Next slide.
 Okay, so we've been working for the last number of months and through a couple meetings on a design concept for this central area for this historically sensitive area, and I'll walk you through the main.
 Concepts here, and with the 3 big ideas for the design concept to improve accessibility to the park.
 And help identify the park as such as as a park and to make some of this really interesting history visible.
 I remember when I first started working on the master plan, and I.
 was out exploring the park, it's definitely not evident that it is or was a town-owned property.
 And so the improvements to the walls certainly help.
 And some simple signage will help to identify it as an important historical park for the town of Medford.
 So the first concept is a history wall.
 which is a, these paths really sort of already exist, they're dirt pathways, mostly, and creating a loop here in this thicker orange line that would help to connect
 a number of these historically sensitive areas and use historic markers to interpret the history a little bit.
 And we'll go through each of those.
 But these blue circles are those 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 markers there.
 Also, two potential areas for welcome signs to the park.
 We'll talk about the
 interpretation and stabilization measures around the former estate site.
 And you have to be able to get to the park, so new crosswalks and accessible parking.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan, we'll kind of walk through each of these.
 First is the history walk.
 The walk, again, in this thicker orange here, it would be an accessible path in terms of slope and surfacing.
 We haven't done a detailed, there hasn't been a detailed field survey done of this area of the park, but we think that it can be an accessible path below 5% slope.
 And we'd like to connect that to new crosswalks so people from this community, or maybe who are parking there could get into this park.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 There are 2 potential areas for welcome signs, and Ryan will talk a little bit more about this at the end.
 It would be great to identify the park, to name it, and to welcome visitors, to make them feel welcome.
 So here, opposite Jackson Road or potentially Ravine Road to the north are 2 potential areas for welcome signs.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 just a little bit history about Thomas Brooks Park.
 This is 1860 Brooks estate plan, which was pretty big.
 A lot of this land has since been given to the city of Medford.
 Our little sliver right there is Thomas Brooks Park.
 You can tell it's this almost like sharp triangle.
 Up on the upper right is
 at H.F.
 Walling Plan from 1855.
 And here we see our park there.
 It's easy to identify the railroad, which is this diagonal line, and then Grove Street.
 And so that sliver right there is what the future park looked like in 1855.
 It is adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.
 And then the six-acre park was conveyed to the city in 1924, again, with the stipulation that the
 brick wall, now known as Pomp's Wall, be forever maintained.
 On the next slide, we talk about these historic markers.
 Originally, in earlier iteration, this walk was just a linear path from here to here.
 But then as we took some feedback and evolved it a little bit, it's become more of a loop.
 Pomp's wall is right here just to orient everyone.
 It's great.
 And Grove Street is right here.
 So the proposal is to have a series of five simple historic markers so that visitors to the site would help to understand the rich history here a little bit better.
 Both the Native American history,
 which marker could be there, the African American history with this pretty remarkable wall, Pomp's Wall, that's just been restored.
 There's a pretty fascinating history of water systems and the Middlesex Canal here, and
 This is an appropriate place for that historic marker because it looks out over this lawn.
 We'll talk about that in a little bit.
 And then on the back of the park here, you're right next to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, now known as the MBTA Lowell Branch Railroad.
 which also has a rich history, and then coming around to the colonial American history of the site and the sort of remains of the Thomas Brooke estate and thinking about how to interpret and mark that.
 Okay, so over the next handful of slides, we move to the next one, we'll talk about how to do that and why that's important.
 So the Native American historic marker, again, with the archaic,
 I have a hard time saying that word today.
 With the dig that was just done, there were 64 pre-contact artifacts found collected during the 22-23 dig, which is pretty neat.
 Maybe some community members on this call or in this picture, I don't know.
 Largely, the items that were found were chipping debris and pottery shards.
 presumably from the middle to late Woodlands period, 2000 to 450 years ago.
 So pretty significant historical resource.
 And this has a potential for rich Native American history, given the proximity of water resources and the
 topography.
 So that's pretty invisible now, but it'd be great to make that history a little bit more visible, just with a simple interpretive marker.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we talk about Pomp's Wall.
 Okay, the existing marker, which is there, if you want to
 Sneak on the edge of the roadway and or peek at it from your car is shown on the upper right there.
 This upper left is a historic photo, which the date is unknown of, and the photo in the middle is from 1899.
 So you can look up Grove Street.
 You can see the wall, it's beginning to get overgrown there, but pretty open behind it, some of the big trees there.
 We know the wall was constructed around 1760, that the city is required to preserve and forever maintain it in that deed.
 to the city, it stipulates that.
 And then there was this recent, very important restoration and renaming of the wall.
 So that's an important history to help make visible.
 Okay, if we go to the next slide, we can help to mark in a way the importance of the Medford water systems.
 This picture on the left is a little hard to see.
 All these slides will be posted on the
 Historical Commission website.
 And if you look on there, there's a lot of information from the past number of years from all the studies and meetings that were done.
 This is a plaque elsewhere in Medford that shows the Middlesex Canal and the route.
 Our little park
 is right here.
 You can see the railroad and Grove Street.
 And so this Middlesex Canal was right to the south of this area.
 The Middlesex Canal was around from 1793 to 1853, ran from Charlestown to Lowell.
 It was partly financed by the Brooks family, which has such a prominent role.
 in the city of Medford.
 It supplied much of the lumber for shipbuilding in Medford.
 That was such a big industry in the city.
 On the lower right is an image of one of the bridges.
 There were a number of
 bridges, 50 bridges, all along the canal.
 And this was one in Medford that was taken down.
 But we think that some of these blocks were used in this Grove Street field stone wall, especially south of Pomp's Wall.
 You can go look and the stones there are more cut in.
 rectilinear blocks.
 I can't get into a lot of it here, but there's really a fascinating study that the head of the MWRA did on the role of Medford in the whole water and sewer development for the city of Boston in the nearby area.
 It's pretty fascinating.
 area where we're proposing this historic marker looking out on that field, well part of the reason the field is there and it's not overgrown is because there's a sewer easement that actually runs through there.
 And so there's a lot of interesting things to talk about for a potential historic marker talking about these water systems and the task will be how to distill this information in a concise way.
 Okay.
 If we go to the next slide, I talked a little bit about the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the proposals for historic marker on the backside of Thomas Brooks Park, talking about this, that this railroad was constructed in 1835.
 Also,
 partly financed by the Brooks family, the people didn't really want the railroad to happen, especially the people who were invested in the canal because the railroad made the canal not as necessary.
 And it essentially replaced the canal in order to speed up.
 Transportation provide year-round freight transportation because the canal would freeze in the winter.
 This railroad, it was the first major railroad in the state, one of the first in the whole Northeast, and it's still used today.
 It's an active rail line as the MBTA Lowell line.
 That's an image on the bottom right.
 You can see Boston and Lowell there.
 Okay, and Ryan, if you go to the next slide, the last historic marker kind of gets back to what we started with, with the dig on the site.
 Now, this is an image of the Brooks Estate House, and the historic marker would help to reinterpret that or interpret that history.
 that this house was built in 1727, you can see here there was a little curved driveway behind that brick wall.
 And that's essentially where, if you walk out there, where that dirt footpath is and where that history walk would be.
 Then you can see the brick wall between the street and the driveway, that's the palms wall.
 We know historically it was noted that there were three black walnut trees in front of the house.
 You can see them in this illustration and also those original trees aren't there.
 But if you're out there in that park, there are black walnut trees that are descendants, I think, of these original trees.
 Then as we know, there are a lot of artifacts recovered.
 from the dig over 1600 from the post-contact or colonial era.
 Okay, on the next slide, we looked at this site.
 This is the general area of that estate house, and the proposal is to both protect and preserve and interpret this site a little bit by marking the
 Corners of where the house was with simple stone blocks and stabilizing the surface with low plantings.
 And then this would be the blue circle that historic marker, which would be able to interpret it.
 So, if you go to the next slide.
 This was one of the site precedents that we looked at, Robbins Farm Park.
 It's a neat park right next door to Medford, up on the top of the hill.
 There's an old farm there.
 It was given to the city, turned into a park, and maybe probably 10 years or so ago,
 Park and Recreation Commission wanted to sort of memorialize the house in the former farm there.
 And so they put, they marked the foundation here with these stone blocks.
 These are kind of similar to what we're thinking for Thomas Brooks Park.
 And they had a simple sign in their case, it was right on the block.
 In our case, maybe it would be a separate standing element as a way to
 Talk about the former farmhouse that was there and give people a sense of that history a little bit.
 Okay, on the next slide we have another site that's interpreted the historic history, tracing the foundations of historic house.
 This is the Governor Winthrop House in Charleston, the great house site where they used found stones and some foundation stones and brought those to the surface and
 Trace that foundation there and then just a simple lawn is a very different setting their more urban area and more extensive historic sign that you can see on the bottom right.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 We also would like to stabilize the surface in a very simple way with ground cover planting.
 There's already a little bit of that there with a vinca that's taken over, naturalized the site a little bit.
 And on the next slide, we'd like to add to that a little bit with a nice native plant, gold star.
 It's native, shade-tolerant, a lot of trees around, pretty low, 6-12 inches tall, and has a nice bloom from the late spring into the fall.
 You can imagine walking on this path and coming across these blocks and a little burst of flowers might be a pretty elegant, beautiful, but yet subtle way to think about this site.
 On the next slide, we talked about another way that we could use plants to bring back the history.
 This is Syringa vulgaris, a common lilac, which is for hundreds of years been part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 And the quote on the bottom here is from the
 Medford paper in 1912, that some of the historic research which the state did, which predated the master plan, they pulled together, and I'll just read the quote, beside the street, Grove Street, and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 So they're talking about Palm's Wall and they're talking about Grove Street, which by the looks of this was originally bordered with lilac.
 So wouldn't it be neat, the upper right image is of the Arnold Arboretum on Lilac Sunday.
 Pro tip, that's a great place to go.
 Amazingly,
 blooms in the middle of May.
 We'd like to bring those lilacs back at the wall.
 On the next slide, we can see a picture of the wall.
 This is looking right up Grove Street and Palm's wall over on the right hand side with a field stone wall next to it.
 And on the next slide, just a little illustration of what some lilacs would look like right behind that wall.
 It would look pretty nice for vehicles or people on the sidewalk over on the other side here.
 It's a nice southern orientation there, southwest orientation.
 So I think those lilacs would do well.
 And at the same time, we could plant some, just a low ground cover on the roadside to help stabilize that embankment there.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we have a look at the existing conditions behind Pompe's wall and up that path so this would be the history walk and then the next slide shows a little illustration of
 what that might look like with some lilacs over on the side in this simple walkway that would then loop around with a series of historic markers and then the stone blocks at the estate house to give a deeper understanding of the rich history of this site.
 Okay, on the next slide, I believe we're hopping into some information Ryan from the historical commission can share on the upcoming improvements for the second phase at the park.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=1938.088s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 好吧，现在我只想快速深入了解第二阶段的构建更新。
 因此，重申一下 Jen 在开头所说的，我们有 2020 年总体规划，但该文件是一份动态文件，可能会发生变化。
 这将会发展。
 因此，无论总体规划中有什么内容，我相信你们中的一些人已经读过，我们使用的分期与施工中所需的分期不同。
 因此，对于这个资助阶段，完全得益于社区保护委员会的慷慨资助，我们打算进行更大规模的考古挖掘，我们打算根据《美国残疾人法案》的要求修剪一些树木并清除枯木，
 通往路边切口、人行道和停车位的建筑通道。
 我们试图通过标记和张贴一些标志来识别十字路口，然后，当然，我们试图将这个地方识别为公园。
 有几件事正在考虑中。
 当然，我们正在关注彼得刚才谈到的这个考古前沿，它正处于早期规划阶段。
 当然，我们正在考虑诸如改善步道清晰度、添加适合场地的树木以及在植树时进行一些灌木修剪和侵入式割草等措施。
 但当然，没有考虑到什么，我们很久以前在公众会议上就听说过，现在我们听到，即使在总体规划中，我们也没有以任何方式考虑社区花园或铁路桥。
 所以我要把这个放在一边，这样人们就知道我们正在考虑的是对公园影响较小的事情，好吗？
 因此，对于考古学，我们打算聘请一位考古学家来探索托马斯·布鲁克斯故居的遗址以及居住在那里的人们，包括布鲁克斯家族及其雇用的员工。
 这是一个鲜为人知的话题，但已被探索过。
 该遗址与新英格兰的奴隶制有很多联系，因此它是一个非常重要的地方。
 所以，在做出任何限制之前
 为了永久保护该遗址，我们希望完成对此事的考古尽职调查。
 我们将寻找社区志愿者，就像上次一样，我们可以让人帮助我们筛选土壤和对文物进行实验室工作，以便人们可以看到它们。
 所以我们一定会为此努力。
 我们考古部分的工作将是我们希望在两者之间设置的限制
 你知道，佩德罗的历史之旅以及对房子和解释面板的解释以及所有这些都是为了保护这个网站免受任何负面影响。
 有很多树木修剪工作要做。
 为此，我们正在研究与该地点 50 棵树龄约 150 年的树木相关的最直接问题。
 其中，保存状况较好的古树有30株。
 他们需要修剪，就像修剪灯一样，只是为了去除一些枯枝，一些领导者折断了，但有10
 公园内和周围的树木完全死了。
 您可以在右侧看到这张图片，其中他们的领导人完全分裂，什么都没有留下，为了公共安全，这些树必须被移除。
 在其他图像中，例如最左边的图像，您可以看到领导者已经分开并摇摇欲坠地悬挂在一些小路上。
 所以我们正在寻找
 将它们全部修剪，使婴儿围栏从一端到另一端都牢固。
 还有两棵入侵的挪威枫树已经完全死亡。
 它们高耸于这个地方。
 他们身高约20英尺，但只有15岁。
 我们希望将其移除，因为任何大小如此之大的树都会造成滋扰，并且会绕过 MBT​​A 的通行权。
 但随着树木的修剪，
 我们希望种植 15 棵新树。
 我说的是橡树，但与城市树木管理员交谈时，它可能是橡树，也可能是糖枫树，这些树原产于新英格兰，也原产于这个地方，我们希望取代这里的入侵性挪威枫树，我们有计划继续种植可以治愈的树木，可以这么说，以便公园成为一个公园并保持森林的感觉。
 现在，作为该项目的一部分，最重要的关键部分之一是我们希望清除整个场地中的所有死木。
 所以我们知道，当格罗夫街发生冰暴时，一些枯木被从街上移走。
 DPW 破坏了这一点。
 让我们完成这项工作吧。
 当然，出于公共安全原因，在隔离墙期间也砍伐了几棵树。
 所有这些都将被消除。
 然后，所有即将死亡或死去的历史树木的各种树便将从公园的一端移至另一端。
 所以这将是一次从上到下的彻底清洁。
 大部分此类材料如果太大，将会从网站上删除。
 如果再小一点的话
 它可以被压碎，我们会将其中一些放回到道路上，这样道路上就有了一些定义。
 为了改善无障碍环境，我们在整个公园内分布了多个设施。
 最重要的是，我们将重新连接格罗夫街东侧的人行道（目前终止于牛顿街）至杰克逊路的新入口。
 我们将在所有墙壁开口处切割人行道。
 Jackson Road、Gravine Road和Layard Road将设有条纹人行道。
 人行横道处将设有指示牌。
 当然，所有这一切都需要很长时间，因为有很多重要的参与者。
 所以我们正在探索和研究设计和概念，但是当我们开始推进这个项目时，城市的公共工程部门、交通部门都必须介入。
 所以我们才刚刚开始，还有很多很多个月的时间。
 但我们希望也许能在 2025 年春季开始施工，这样我们就可以基本上以正确的方式开始新的一年，并在冬季后的第一个可能的施工期间，我们将开始并交付我们已经工作了一年多的这些东西。
 为了获得空间，它们需要在附近的某个地方标记为无障碍路线和公园周围无障碍路径的一部分，即一个停车位。
 当我们最初制定总体规划时，我们被要求禁止汽车进入公园。
 因此，我们必须在某处提供 ADA 无障碍空间。
 我们将与居民以及你们所有人合作，尝试将其安置在一个对无障碍路线和居民都方便的位置。
 但它还要求该市与交通部门举行公开听证会。
 因此，将会有很多很多的机会来解决这个空间适合什么地方以及如何适合的问题。
 当然，
 想法改变了。
 有访问权。
 这并不可取，但如有必要，我们可以将停车位移回原位。
 对于人行道标记，我们希望保持简单。
 你知道，一条简单的油漆人行道就可以了。
 标牌尽量减少。
 前几天我们和交通部门谈过。
 也许人们更喜欢明亮的标志（如果有的话），那就是杰克逊路。
 那里有大量人群集中穿过公园的正门，这甚至可能是居民上下学的安全路线。
 但根据我们听到的反馈，这有待讨论。
 然后是公园标牌。有两种不同类型的公园标牌。
 有欢迎您参加历史之旅的标牌和解说标牌。
 但实际上，在这个阶段，我们试图将公园识别为公园。
 我们希望在同一条街上有类似布鲁克斯庄园标志的东西。
 该网站与
 归布鲁克斯庄园所有，但可能有自己的身份。
 所以我们还没有真正的设计，但我们确实有一些东西可以将其标识为具有一定历史的城市公园，以便每个人都知道它不仅仅是一片废弃的森林，它实际上是梅德福的一个重要场所。
 当然，通过持续的规划，我们正在考虑将一些事情作为该项目的一部分，这些事情将导致其他项目。
 我们有关于树木的历史工作。
 有一次，我们想打开一条种满橡树和黑胡桃木的小巷。
 或许可以减少一些入侵的挪威枫树。
 但我们正在倾听，我们了解到目前植被的作用就像一种声幕。
 因此，作为其中的一部分，我们会讨论种植一些树木，以便随着现有景观的缩小，更大、更合适的树木可以增加尺寸。
 并且这个声音缓冲区始终被维护。
 但同样，这是后期阶段，有很多很多很多淘汰。
 但最大的问题是，正在进行的一些树木修复工作将减轻对 MBTA 围栏的损坏。
 因此，我们将让 MBTA 与我们合作修复围栏，确保公园安全，最终确保没有人能够跨越铁道床。
 这就是我们第二阶段工作的核心。
 所以我们知道您有意见和问题。
 因此，我认为如果您想发表评论或对我们有任何疑问，我们很乐意回答。
 我们只是要求人们举手。
 当然，今晚没有必要发表所有评论。
 这并不是一切的结束。
 我们将尽力继续考古实地工作，这不是
 除了出于安全原因进行挖掘、封顶和一些树木工作之外，对公园有任何影响，但其余工作将在六个月内再次完成该项目，因此，如果您知道稍后会出现问题，并且如果您想花一些时间消化今晚听到的内容并将其放入其中，我们将接受评论并很高兴收到电子邮件
 当然，正如我在会议开始时所说，如果我们没有您的电子邮件，如果您不在我们的联系人列表中，请向我们发送电子邮件，我们将很乐意将您添加到我们的电子邮件和广告中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2629.627s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 谢谢，瑞安。
 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 正如瑞安所说，我很高兴在此时开放评论或提问的空间。
 如果有人有什么事，如果他们想举手，我会取消静音并打电话。
 塔玛拉，如果你想取消静音。
 尼克，我们可以知道您的注册地址吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2651.095s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的。
 西梅德福牛顿路 14 号，托马斯布鲁克公园南侧。
 简而言之，我只想感谢大家的关注、倾听社区的声音、感谢他们为保护该地区的历史和特有事物所做的努力和辛勤工作。
 我只想说谢谢。
 显然，你的演讲需要做很多工作。
 您显然正在倾听社区的声音，我喜欢您所做的事情并且非常欣赏。
 非常感谢您的辛勤工作。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2683.696s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 非常感谢。
 戴夫，如果你想取消静音，我会看到你的手。
 我们可以得到您的姓名和地址以供注册吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2691.141s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 所以我的问题是：有考虑到什么吗？
 正在发生的事情早在我们住在这里之前就已经发生了，去公园的人只是剪到那里，而我们这边的墙还没有完工。
 对于我们这些住在这里的人来说，这有点烦人。
 许多人只是简单地修剪草坪、修剪草坪、修剪人行道。
 我的观点是，如果这部分墙没有完工，我们这边街道直到高街的人们，那个地区的每个人，将继续以这种方式穿过我们的房产和布鲁克斯庄园。
 更少的人会用不同的目标来实现你的所有目标
 嗯，你知道，地点、走廊等等。
 所以我不知道是否有人谈论过要完成我们住处一侧的那部分墙。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2766.663s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 所以我可以发表评论，瑞安可能也想插话。
 我们听到了很多关于隔离墙这一端的评论。
 正是出于您所说的原因，这就是该地点关闭的原因，因为人们穿过私人财产进入公园。
 由于这一点以及从交通角度看的视线，开口被抬高，这样过马路就更容易了。
 现在我们知道，必须从一侧曲折到另一侧并不理想。
 这就是为什么在下一阶段，我们将把街道同一侧的人行道拓宽到现有的开口，这样人们就不必从一侧穿过到另一侧。
 戴夫，他们也不必穿过您的车道，进入您的房产即可到达草地公园区域。
 所以我们正在努力解决这个问题，我们理解并倾听格罗夫街下端和那些小巷里人们的挫败感，我们正在努力让街那一侧的人们更容易不必两次过马路。
 瑞安，请随意插话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2841.618s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 是的，我们只是，你知道，我们绝对想修建那条人行道。
 我们故意将墙留出五英尺，只是为了确保有空间放置人行道。
 你知道，墙弯曲的那一侧会有一棵树，所以它会消失。
 我认为有一个减速带标志需要调整。
 但随后将有一段愉快而温馨的步行至主入口。
 很明显，如果人行横道上有一些标志，如果我们竖起一些灯光标志，可以这么说，这样人们就知道在晚上或光线很少的时候，这是人行横道，走到公园的主入口并停在那里会更明显。
 你知道，目前来说，
 这是一条欲望之路，但如果我们为人们提供一个干净且维护良好的替代方案，它就会慢慢自行解决。
 与公园的另一端一样，出于公共安全原因，我们也关闭了格罗夫街铁路桥的另一端。
 居民们再次爬上了围墙，因为人们正在这样做，但似乎一切都自行解决了。
 所以我们认为随着时间的推移，这种情况也会发生。
 独自解决。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2930.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 佐伊，我看到你的手了。
 如果您可以向我们提供您的注册姓名和地址。
 是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2935.229s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: 我是 Zoe Moutsos，来自约翰逊大道 33 号。
 你好，戴夫。
 戴夫的邻居。
 我是一个侵入者，穿过你的财产进入公园。
 我想谈谈住在泰勒和约翰逊大道岛上的人们。
 这就是我们这样做的原因。
 在最初的计划中，我看到牛顿路有一个入口，那就太好了。
 我不知道为什么它被删除或为什么它没有发生，但我们住在梅德福的一部分，根本无法轻松进入绿地。
 我们的孩子必须穿过几条繁忙而可怕的街道。
 为了开始这个笑话，他说我们实际上是在穿过一条铁轨，然后我们向右转这条路到达这个小公园。
 你知道，我们要过马路，除非我们能步行去杂货店并进入公园。
 你知道，我们正在穿过格罗夫街，它就像一条高速公路。
 所以我认为这就是原因。
 这就是为什么我不记得瑞安使用了什么语言，这就是为什么人们朝着这个方向前进，这就是为什么当计划没有得到执行并被关闭时我们如此失望。
 我认为我们可以在那里做点什么，砍掉一些树，让人们进来而不是在戴夫的土地上行走，因为我知道这不是，
 充足并不理想，但我们剩下的选择是在黑暗和光线不足的情况下带着孩子和狗在车流中奔跑，沿着小路行走。我怀疑这条路是否足够宽，是否符合 ADA 标准。
 我无法想象它是这样的。
 现在它布满了洞，布满了玻璃，确实如此，
 这个公园的大部分地方都非常美丽，我知道建成后会很精彩，但在约翰逊大道上，至少对我来说，这是一个巨大的失望，而且我知道该地区的其他人基本上再次被困在人们超速行驶的高速公路上。
 而且我们无法到达最近的绿地。
 所以我想我想说的是也许我们可以考虑把牛顿路放在那里。
 另外，除了我对此的所有咆哮之外，感谢您的聆听。
 那个公园里有很多入侵者。
 有黑疣、大蒜芥末、毒藤，根据需要，好像入侵者不仅仅是挪威人，对吧？
 所以我想知道：当有人在那里的时候，是否有应对这些入侵者的计划？
 因为，我的天啊，最近两年的蒜蓉芥末，如果你喜欢那种，
 公园清洁。
 我不知道我们在说什么。
 在本次演示中，我们并没有真正关注该区域，但如果你仔细观察，牛顿路附近的空地现在几乎全是大蒜芥末和黑疣。
 这只会继续变得更糟。
 不管怎样，谢谢。
 我知道这会很棒，但我真的很想考虑安全进入以及格罗夫街确实很危险这一事实。
 人们在那条路上开得很快。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3125.498s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 谢谢佐伊。
 我也住在格罗夫街，所以我可以清楚地听到你的声音。
 我想和 John Ardizzone 谈谈，因为我看到你举起了手，我以前见过这个，而且我知道你没有在 Zoom 上使用你的手。
 所以我只是想阻止你举手。
 所以，约翰，如果您想取消静音，并且我们可以获取您的姓名和地址以进行注册，请联系我们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3147.976s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 约翰·阿特 (John art) 在约翰逊大道 53 号仅住了 30 年。
 所以我知道这个公园的全部历史。
 我拥有格罗夫街 69 号。
 我的房客是大卫。
 人们穿过我的车道去公园，事情不应该这样。
 本来应该是锁着的。
 这只是一个问题。
 另一个问题是，在赚这么多钱的整个过程中，这条街上的交通量很大，而且你在上面投入的流量越来越多。
 另一件事是我们正在谈论人们带着孩子。
 这严格来说是一个狗公园。
 我就是其中之一，我在这里的时间比这张照片中的其他人都长。
 彼得、瑞安，这些人中的任何一个都来了。
 他们待在那里的时间没有我那么长。
 当那是一个胜利花园时，我在那里，当时那里有社区花园。
 很漂亮。
 你说的是当他们建造隔离墙时，他们摧毁了隔离墙后面的所有植物和所有树木。
 建造这堵墙的人必须小心地抬起它，就像他们在超市顶部所做的那样。
 这些家伙刚刚把它击倒了。
 他们堆了一堆石头。
 另一件事是你说你的视力非常敏感。
 他们从我的车库里拿走了五到十个四分之三英寸的石轮，将它们拆散，然后扔到田里。
 好的？
 那块石头应该用作他们建造的那堵美丽墙的基础。
 他们从不使用任何石头。
 当他们完成后，他们带着反铲进来并平整了东西。
 我在该地区工作。
 我已在该地区工作了 30 年。
 我知道它的历史。
 你说的是运河和考古发掘。
 这座城市，这座城市，多年来一直在那里割草并破坏这个地方。
 格罗夫街曾经非常安静。
 现在你所要做的就是听到火车的声音，因为你清除了那些岩石周围的所有垃圾。
 你必须真正地进去，砍掉那堵墙后面 20 英尺的地方，推倒那里所有的墙。
 他们一开始并不是这样的。
 当他们开始修建这座桥时，他们把它弄得又漂亮又整洁。
 他们一开始甚至使用石头。
 我从事建筑行业。
 我知道。
 当你走到那里的三分之一时，忘记岩石吧。
 忘记绕着树林走。
 他们只是摧毁了一切。
 现在那里一片混乱。
 你应该做的只是清理公园。
 喧闹、饮酒，你想抢走人们的钱包。
 但问题是，所有这些人都在谈论它有多么美妙。
 他们不住在隔壁。
 这并不影响他们。
 你已经开辟了一条路。
 我的朋友迈克·大卫，他的妻子是我的侄女。
 晚上十点有人在那里遛狗。
 没有孩子，唯一在那个公园玩耍的孩子住在 69 Grove 旁边的房子里。
 他们去那里，他们是曲棍球孩子。
 那里没有孩子，这是一个狗公园。
 好吧，全是狗屎。
 您正在谈论一个您想要保持整洁干净的大地方。
 你让狗在那里拉屎已经三十年了。
 没有人知道这处房产的历史。
 你在谈论历史，关于水。
 马萨诸塞州的水地役权穿过那里。
 我家旁边有 MBTA 地役权。
 我是该财产的唯一真正的共同作者。
 你从来没有警告过我。
 就像，为什么？
 我和交通部门谈过。
 你能在我的车道尽头设置人行横道吗？
 那么当有人放弃时会发生什么呢？
 如果他们后退，他们就会再次到达人行横道。
 除非必要，人行横道必须位于现有建筑物 120 英尺范围内。
 它不需要它。
 你会走路吗？人们会走路吗？他们会去哪里？
 你正在说话，其他人说这是唯一适合孩子的地方。
 梅德福有更多的绿地。
 我的儿子是一只野生动物。
 探索这座城市的所有绿色空间。
 我们在梅德福、神秘湖和布鲁克斯庄园拥有更多绿地。
 后面肯定有100英亩。
 您必须过马路才能到达绿地。
 生活在西梅德福的人们非常幸运。
 结果是他们通过这样做来摧毁它。
 进去清理公园。
 我的入口墙，你为什么不完成它？
 你要建一堵墙，修一条人行道，把它捡起来，明天派你的人去完成这堵墙。
 你为什么不这样做呢？
 你认为如果你住在 69 号超市，出门时有人开车经过你的车，你会发疯。
 晚上10点，还有人遛狗。
 它不在你的院子里，所以不会打扰你。
 杰克逊路 (Jackson Road) 一人居住，泰勒 (Tyler) 一人居住，约翰 (John) 一人居住。
 这些人中没有一个像我一样呆在那里那么久。
 我在那里，从来没有出现过问题。
 美丽的街区。
 那时的森林比现在好得多。
 你已经很多年没有照顾他们了。
 时不时地，你会修剪他们的草坪。
 那个开口，那个入口，是一个很小的开口。
 发生的事情是他们移走了大石头，这样他们就可以把割草机放进去。
 一切就是这样开始的。
 我自 2003 年起就拥有那栋房子，并在约翰逊大道 (Johnson Avenue) 住了 30 年。
 我刚刚卖掉了那里的房子，但仍然拥有 69 Grocery。
 我已经联系好了。
 交通部门会过来。
 他们不希望那里出现问题。
 我们在约翰逊大道从来没有遇到过任何问题。
 他们摧毁了约翰逊大道与超市交汇处的另一部分。
 他们摧毁了那个地区。
 那里从未发生过任何事故。
 胡安，非常感谢您的评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3494.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 我现在需要继续讨论其他一些评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3496.549s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 你应该警告我的。
 你从来没有警告过我。
 我是唯一的邻居。
 我永远不会通知你。
 我收到邻居的通知。
 你知道他们做什么吗？
 你可以扒别人的口袋。
 它不在你的院子里，所以不会打扰你。
 这就是全部内容。
 你想要入侵植物。
 你正在挖掘东西，那些人毁掉了这个地方，你说这是一件微妙的事情。
 我会允许你带着 510 个石轮来到我的庄园，甚至不问我就将它们扔在那里。
 他那里有警察。
 他们说，嘿，如果他们破坏了车道，他们就必须修理它。
 谁允许这样做？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3532.841s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 胡安，非常感谢你。
 很抱歉必须继续发表其他评论。
 非常感谢。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3545.777s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 是的，非常感谢你，弗兰克·米勒。
 约翰说，我住在格罗夫 56 号，所以我是邻居之一。
 所以我住的地方离公园很近，比约翰住的地方还要近。
 我的孙子一直在那里玩。
 他今年 10 岁了。
 他广泛使用它。
 我也在那里看到其他孩子，所以我知道它被使用了。
 当然，人们也会在那里遛狗，但除此之外，只有几件事。
 首先，非常感谢。
 我认为这是一个重要的改进。
 我很高兴你把一切都清理干净了。
 由于所有的枯木和枯树，我总是担心它们会起火。
 所以这是一个很大的进步。
 我喜欢你所做的一切。
 唯一让我有点失望的是，因为我认为在最初的计划中你说它将是灰色的人行道，但看起来你已经放弃了这一点。
 那么还有可能吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3602.83s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 因此，我们与交通部门讨论了修建高架人行道，问题是这涉及安装集水池，这增加了巨大的成本。
 如果那里还没有的话。
 在大多数情况下，我们建议设置人行横道的位置附近没有人行横道。
 所以我们关注的是那里存在的障碍。
 我们可以利用流量来尝试添加另一条。
 我们与他们讨论的另一件事是，也许可以在公园边缘建立一个安全区，这样整个城市的限速就不会是 25 公里。就像每小时 20 英里。
 但我们知道人们在这条路上超速行驶，视线是一个问题，而且有些人希望通过减速来确保安全。
 我们知道这是到达某些地方的捷径。
 我自己从梅德福的其他地方开车经过这里，但也许让人们放慢速度会有助于使它更安全。
 也许甚至将其与标牌一起使用也会有所帮助。
 让它更安全一点。
 但如果我们能够修建高架人行道，我们就会这么做。
 但除此之外，我们会做相反的事情，确保两侧的坡道都可以进入。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3693.153s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: 非常感谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3695.935s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 谢谢，弗兰克。
 戴安娜，下次见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3705.668s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 好的，你好，黛安·诺埃尔。
 我住在牛顿路11号，公园对面的One House Inn。
 我想我同意这里所有发言者的观点，至少在某种意义上，那就是，非常感谢你们的这次演讲。
 我们正在研究梅德福的历史并对其进行深思熟虑，这给我留下了深刻的印象和自豪。
 所以，感谢您所做的这项工作。
 与约翰一样，我想说我认为社区意识是关键。
 我觉得如果我没有订阅你们的时事通讯并且对这个话题不感兴趣，我就不会听说今晚的这次会议。
 我认为社区中有很多感兴趣的人只是不知道正在做出决定。
 所以我不知道这是否是字面意思
 从约翰的角度来看这个社区，我认为决策的透明度并不高，而且存在很多利益。
 呃，黄油和社区成员，我认为他们至少希望有意识，如果没有能力，你知道，在会议上发言。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3777.742s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 我可以快速打断并向公众提问吗？
 对于在座的各位，你们中是否有人接到过反向 911 电话，因为我们大约两周前要求市政府做一个，如果没有完成，我知道他们会把它放在城市日历上，但我有问过他们吗？
 反向通话只是为了传达信息，你知道，我们想确保你知道你认识的人还有其他方式，我在社交媒体上发布了这个，市政府把它放在他们的日历上，但是，是的，我们知道不是每个人都在 Facebook 上，不是每个人都在社交媒体上，所以你知道，我们希望确保我们有像你这样的人，约翰，你会知道，像每个人过去一样听电话并回复消息。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3819.423s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 我得到了一个，但我的意思是，我住在格罗夫的另一边，并且我注册了城市警报。
 那么每个人都注册接收城市警报吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3826.977s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: 是的，我没有收到。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3829.032s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 好吧，让我们看看为什么我们特别要求它。我的意思是，我知道它被取消了，因为我收到了它。
 但有什么意义呢？我的意思是，我正在组织一个会议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3836.496s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 因此，如果我可以简单地介绍一下，如果您注册了城市警报但没有注册，并且您在该地区并且没有收到消息，则系统中可能没有您的地址。
 这是我们认为存在的问题。
 为此，您可以访问该市网站上的警报。
 你可以个性化它，无论是在你的手机上，如果是短信，你可以通过电子邮件接收它，你可以在你的固定电话上以纸质形式接收它，而不是纸质的。
 但如果您在那里没有地址，您将不会收到这样的本地化消息。
 所以我只是想让人们意识到这一点。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3876.048s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，我知道这很难，我知道没有人能再找到工作，但我的意思是，肯定有办法，无论是传统的还是社交媒体。
 我只知道很难集中精力参加这些会议，而且有很多人对这个公园、这个社区感兴趣。
 我认为他们会欣赏更多的认识。
 因此，如果你能在不同的路径上投入更多的努力，至少
 传播这个消息。
 我认为这会有用。
 我想再次向另一位评论者重申牛顿路入口的关闭。
 显然，作为牛顿路人，我真的很怀念它。
 这确实让公园的尽头几乎成了死胡同。
 南侧，不仅是为了出入，也是为了享受。
 很少有人去公园中间，然后再回到那个区域，在他们关闭公园之前，这个区域实际上是南侧每个人的入口。
 我听到了约翰的沮丧，也听到了房客的沮丧。
 每个人都很沮丧。
 你知道，我们希望他回来。
 我们希望入口向后退，以打开整个公园的长度。
 所以我知道这是一个非常一致的信息，几乎附近的每个人
 除此之外也许约翰还有获得支持的权利。
 但是，你知道，只要输入一个条目，每个人都会得到它。
 然后，然后是我的、我的、我的评论，我认为这是独一无二的，直到现在才说过。
 再说一次，我认为计划很棒。
 我认为你所做的很棒。
 我关心的始终是维护和未来状态。
 拥有一个美丽的公园和美丽的照片是一回事，但正如我们所见，如果你没有预算或不考虑维护它，
 它可能会在很短的时间内变得非常糟糕。
 因此，在计划时请考虑一下，您的预算中或您的想法中有一项是关于如何在执行当天尽可能保持其美观的。
 所以谢谢你。
 谢谢你，戴安娜。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4024.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 我只想跳到那个音符。
 我觉得这是一个很好的理念，整个城市都应该有。
 我会像对待历史建筑一样对待这片风景。
 可以这么说，您进行的维护和保存越多，所需的维护和更新就越少。
 所以，是的，我们正在推进公园的清洁工作，希望它保持清洁、维护良好和使用良好，以便获得应有的预算。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4055.632s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 好吧，下一位评论员是 C. Mariano。
 如果您想向我们提供您的姓名和地址以进行注册，请。</p>

 有很多事情正在发生。
 我喜欢总体规划。
 看起来不错。
 那里有很多黑百合树。
 这就像在家里做一个项目，对吧？
 考古旗帜仍然在那里。
 所以这是垃圾。
 你走这些路。
 我每天至少在这片森林里待 30 分钟，每一天。
 我和我的儿子出去，必须清理筑墙工人扔掉的所有碎玻璃，这些碎玻璃挡住了道路。
 我们还没有接近。
 如果你出去想在博斯克一侧修建人行道，那一侧就不够宽。
 现在你的路不够宽。
 因此，墙应该在那时被推开以缓解约翰的问题。
 我同意，应该有一个南入口，100%。
 仍然存在的树木残骸导致整个社区都去森林里扔垃圾。
 一次又一次变成一堆垃圾。
 我同意关于入侵物种的说法。
 我们总是出去撒蒜芥末。
 每次遛狗时我都会这样做。
 我一边喝大蒜芥末，一边闻着它的味道，你知道，我们确实在某些领域做出了改变，但是
 这整个地区曾经非常美丽。
 由于道路又脏又深，现在已经成堆的泥巴了。
 有玻璃。
 我无法克服打破墙壁的玻璃数量。
 这太荒谬了。
 还有很多事情可以做。
 但令大家担心的是，这并不是一个公园。
 这是当地的一个公园。
 这不会成为人们前来参观我们的吸引力。
 我住在墙前。
 也许一年有四次，我看到有人在格罗夫街停下来，走上前看路牌。
 你知道我的意思吗？
 所以我真的很欣赏改进的想法，但我认为你只需要评估自己就知道是否会出现平局。
 向广大公众。
 你知道我的意思吗？
 因此，最重要的是周围人的意见，无论是直接的还是周围路上的意见。
 我的意思是，如果那里会有一个胜利花园并且……胜利花园是不可能的。
 嗯，这很好，因为我们一直在进行内部对话，因为我们整个地区都存在老鼠问题。
 所以，一切都很好。
 所以这是一回事，但是，你知道，田地几乎没有被割草，也许一年两次。
 即使来自你，仍然有很多碎石。
 所以有一天，我从公园里取下了一个圆锥体的底部，把它放在路边，希望镇上的人终于能来拿它。
 因为自从建墙以来它就在那里了。
 嗯，我曾经在 C 点击解决方案中看到过一次，有人抱怨在那里倾倒。
 我认为这变成了与任何来看他的人的争吵，但是
 我的意思是，如果你不这样做，如果你开始一个项目并将其作为垃圾，人们会转过身去想，哦，那仍然是垃圾。
 我可以用它做任何我想做的事。
 因此，该项目第一阶段似乎已启动但尚未完成。
 你知道，警卫周围插着旗帜，呆在那里是很恶心的。
 在墙开始对你说实话之前，我曾经对你友善得多。
 我希望你制定的计划能够实现并消失。
 我很高兴，你知道，我希望它仍然在木板上，通往公园的桥上，因为人们再次必须步行到山顶。
 孩子们必须在格罗夫街及其周围行走。
 我告诉你，迈克，栅栏已经倒塌了。
 你知道，我儿子穿过铁轨，因为这几乎比爬上格罗夫街角去娱乐中心要安全。
 你知道，这些是我的担忧。
 其中有很多。
 我应该列一个清单，但可能需要 30 分钟。
 但它肯定会涉及更多当地人，你知道，因为如果你不住在这里，你就不会来这个公园。
 你知道，这不是停车场。
 这不是吻痕。
 这完全不是那样的。
 然后。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4334.142s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 非常感谢您，如果您有更多想法，请随时给我们发电子邮件。
 你知道，这是一个持续的对话。
 我还有一点。
 等等，约翰。
 约翰，我需要这个，我还有其他人举手，所以我想发表评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4351.289s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 非常快。
 黛安正在谈论她的儿子走在人行道上并带着人们走在那里。
 如果人们住在那里，会有什么感觉？
 他们有孩子，有人走在人行道上。
 我的隐私就在里面。
 他们为什么不把墙关起来，把开口开在街道中间呢？
 我不明白他们为什么不这样做。
 明天关闭那堵墙，然后在格罗夫街打开它。
 那条人行道，就像我是对的那样，那条人行道不够宽，不足以构成那条人行道。
 修墙的工作很糟糕，里面一片狼藉。
 而且比以前更吵了，因为所有的垃圾都是从那里出来的。
 他们需要回到第一阶段。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4392.777s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 谢谢你，约翰。
 非常感谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4397.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 在人们介入之前，让我提供一些澄清，这可能会有所帮助。
 所以在关于结束这个结局的讨论中，有一些不同的事情。
 我们不能在那里设置人行横道，因为已经有人行横道了。
 我们不希望有人穿过入口。
 但除此之外，
 正如我之前提到的，我们希望将人流集中在杰克逊路的主要十字路口，因此人行道是必要的。
 整堵墙有五英尺长。
 实际上有些地方比这个还要多，但有五英尺。
 ADA 人行道从墙到人行道的距离必须为 48 英寸，净空空间必须为 36 英寸。
 我们有这个。
 前几天我们在
 公园。
 在成本方面，我们会考虑重新开放隔离墙的成本或拓宽人行道的成本。
 杰克逊路的人行道便宜得多，大约10,000美元。
 这会花费类似的费用
 36,000 美元让承包商回来、搬家、打开墙壁、拆除人行道、收回墙壁并打开开口。
 其成本约为 20,000 美元或更少，具体取决于它与较大项目、人行道布置、路缘切割布置、人行横道布置和标识的关系程度。
 所以我们只是试图权衡两者的利弊。
 公众意见与确保我们对收到的税收金额承担财政责任。
 但同样，这一切都有待讨论。
 各位，这是一个意见。
 然后交通可能会突然说：不，不要这样做。
 让我们回到建墙的想法，我们就去做。
 但是，您知道，我们还必须提供 ADA 设施，以确保公园无障碍，因为我们收到了人们想要使用公园的反馈，我们有义务这样做。
 作为前期工作的一部分，我们想说的是，如果我们要打开和关闭入口，它们都将是无障碍的。
 你知道，每个人都可以进入公园，即使社区其他地方的人没有使用它，它就在那里，所以它可以。
 好的。
 所以我认为普遍的共识是，即使公众不来看它，如果他们愿意的话也可以看到。
 你当然不能让任何人或任何人做到这一点。
 但你知道，我。
 作为邻居，您当然希望这对您有用，但我们也需要确保我们正在尽一切努力使这对整个城市也适用。
 你知道，M-Belt 和王室都有自己的小景点，但这确实是这座城市唯一一个庆祝历史的公园。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4565.828s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 本杰明·奥卡迪，你可以发表你的评论。
 如果我们能获得您的姓名和地址以进行注册，请。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4572.062s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: 大家好，我是奥尔加，凯蒂，我是本杰明的妻子。
 我有一些意见想分享。
 我们在杰克逊路 38 号。
 所以，感谢您的演讲。
 显然，您在设计演示文稿时充分考虑了社区的大量意见，并为第二阶段提出了另一种解释。
 因此，我感谢您认真倾听社区的意见，尤其是我们这些每天使用公园并
 非常积极地保护它并为这个社区的成员提供帮助。
 我提出的意见特别涉及公园树木和声屏障的规划及其维护。
 所以，我和我丈夫在我们住在这里的过去三年里注意到，自从第一阶段完成以来，音障已经完全被破坏了。
 火车的噪音为
 这太荒谬了，我们的房子在摇晃。
 就好像每天都会发生几次小地震，因为第一部分修复城墙时砍伐的树木引起的震动。
 因此，我非常担心项目后期将砍伐的额外树木，因为虽然会种植一些新树，但我们希望时间不会匹配，因为这些树成熟到成熟的水平需要时间
 目前砍伐的树木已有20、30年的树龄。
 因此，在它们成为有效的声屏障之前，还需要一些时间。
 与此同时，火车的噪音也很荒谬。
 就所发生的音障破坏而言，震动是可怕的。
 它会导致基础问题和额外的负外部性，而您在设计这个项目时最初可能没有考虑到这些问题。
 所以我认为有必要采取其他措施。
 已采取措施通过砍伐额外的树木来减少声屏障的影响，并且所种植的任何树木必须生长得非常快才能取代该声屏障。
 尽快。
 我的第二个问题是关于这些树木的维护。
 具体来说，谁来管理这些项目？
 是梅德福林业部门吗？
 会是私人树艺师吗？
 是否留出资金来浇灌这些新树并确保它们生存？
 因为梅德福种植的很多树，首先，新树需要很长时间才能种植，原因我们今天不会讨论，而且这些树也没有维护，因为没有人浇水，因为没有钱。
 因此，任何新种植的树基本上都需要至少三年的定期护理才能确保其成活。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4741.324s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 是的，那么，
 你知道，当我试图想出关于声屏障的好主意时，你知道，也许找到一种方法来美化铁路一侧的边界，用更多低矮的灌木丛来消散整个公园的噪音，也许是有意义的。
 而且，你知道，也许我们可以增加树木预算。
 所以这是我们当然可以与景观设计师彼得讨论的事情，他当然可以帮助并研究这个问题。
 我们可以解决这个问题。
 我们可以尝试看看这一点。
 正如有人提到的，MBTA 围栏倒塌了。
 我们希望确保树工作完成后它可以再次工作。
 这样一来，那里就不再存在不安全的过境点，因为一旦施工完成，火车就会离开。
 你知道，全速前进，并不是每个人都停在那里。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4806.644s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 所以我不想多说，但我和我的儿子可以证明这一点，因为她过去曾取笑过我，但是。
 我们实际上试图清理路边和后面的Poms Walter Ravine，我们实际上拔掉了杂草，进去种植了本地花卉，就像那边的一个真正的授粉花园一样。
 墙前墙后都是泥土，没有泥土，泥土，下面什么也没有，只有岩石。
 事实上，今年我们有朋友捐赠了不同的百合和不同的球茎，我们试图将它们种植在墙的底部，你知道，在侧面，如果你知道这个区域，有一棵树，就像墙左侧后面的一个小凸起。
 但要记住的一件事肯定是浇水，因为我不确定它们中的任何一个都能坚持下去。
 我的种子，今年我放了价值 60 美元的种子，去年放了价值 80 美元的种子。
 我们有一些花了一段时间，但我讨厌说这个词，因为有人不喜欢它，我不知道谁在这里，但随着气候变化，这是一个非常炎热和干燥的冬天。
 如果你住在这里，你就会知道太阳从哪里来。
 阳光不一定直接照射到该区域。
 然后就超级超级干燥，没有污垢。
 没有地板。
 直接在那堵墙的每一侧。
 一旦你进入或经过它，就会发现有很多杂草的泥土。
 但如果你想做一些装饰性的事情，比如百合花或其他任何植物，就必须有人照顾它，尤其是种植树木。
 所以那里没有直接的水。
 我真的想过问我的邻居我是否可以使用他们在街角的房子，然后用水管冲洗他们街对面的房子。
 我认为在这一点上这是没有意义的。
 而且到处都是杂草丛生。
 我的意思是，这座城市每年秋天都会来一次，草会毁掉一切。
 事实上，我去年有一个正在生长的花园，他们来了，除掉了所有的杂草。
 所以是的。
 但仅此而已。
 我只是想强调这一点。
 如果你想这样做，你就必须为其他事情做好预算。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4942.083s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 非常感谢。
 也感谢奥尔加的这些评论，我们一定会重新审视景观美化、树木和维护计划。
 我在这里列了一个清单，让您知道，我们将联系彼得和我们的一些同事来讨论这个问题并更深入地思考它。
 非常感谢。
 谢谢。
 好吧，接下来我看看BNIC。
 如果您可以取消静音并向我们提供您的姓名和地址以供注册。
 你好，BNIC。
 想发表评论吗？
 你举手了。
 如果您想说话，我们听不到您的声音。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5002.169s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 他们已经重新激活，但我们听不到他们的声音。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5007.312s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 好的，我会转到下一个人，然后再回复您。
 黛安，如果你想这样做，我看到你又举手了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5014.375s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 是的，是的，我只是想回应瑞安关于对人行道与墙进行成本分析的评论。
 再次回到反馈，我认为如果他们在关闭牛顿路围墙之前询问，我们可以节省 36,000 美元。
 好的。
 因此，我认为这是我们许多人都会解决的一个挫败感。
 我也想如果你问社区，你更喜欢哪一个？
 我想我们都会说我们宁愿有首付也不愿花钱。
 换句话说，接触社区并获得大量的回复，而不仅仅是我们这 20 个人有幸找到这次会议。
 进行谷歌民意调查，在做出决定之前做一些真正达成共识的事情。
 您知道，我们并没有要求您切断该访问权限。
 你做到了。
 现在我们要求您归还它。
 你说这会很昂贵，但这不是你一开始就应该做的事情。
 我认为这是我们大家都共有的真正的挫败感。
 因此，在做出此类决定之前，请倾听并寻求广泛的社区意见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5104.873s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 谢谢你，戴安娜。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5107.135s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 我再打断一下。
 它不在你的后院。
 如果我在你家附近，这些人，让我告诉你，这些人。
 不。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5117.783s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: 胡安，我同意你的看法。
 我同意使用您的财产是您的财产。
 我要求重新开放公众访问。
 约翰，我们实际上意见一致。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5132.756s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 不，你不是。
 十点钟你还在我的车道上遛狗。
 每个人都在遛狗。
 这是一个狗公园。
 我们必须澄清这一点。
 约翰，你没在听。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5143.993s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: 我们要求在牛顿路有一个入口，以阻止您进入。
 我不知道你是否真的拥有通往那堵墙的所有路，这是第二个问题，无论如何。
 我们都能理解这一点。
 好吧，伙计们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5157.377s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 好吧，伙计们。
 非常感谢。
 我要请你中断这次对话。

 我们听到了约翰的声音。
 我们收到了牛顿路居民的来信。
 今晚我就这样吧。
 非常感谢。
 我很欣赏这一点。
 我会将其传递给下一个举手的人，即 BNIC。
 如果您无法保持沉默，而我们之前无法收到您的消息，如果您可以让自己为人所知，如果您有任何意见，如果没有，我将放下手并转向下一个人。
 好的，我没有 BNIC 的消息。
 再一次，我明天会回来。
 我看到你举手了。
 请随时留下您的评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5211.993s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的。
 嗨，珍。
 我，你知道，我真的同意我们许多社区成员的观点，我听到约翰的沮丧和黛安的沮丧和
 我认为格罗夫街南侧应该有一条通道，显然不会干扰某人的个人权利和个人财产。
 所以我能听到他们大声而清晰的声音。
 你知道，约翰，我知道你在这里已经很长时间了，但我也在这里已经 20 多年了。
 你知道，我不是这个社区的新手，它不仅仅是一个狗公园。
 我们看到很多孩子从那里进进出出。
 我喜欢这个公园。
 我知道有，你知道，
 我们很多人都不愿意改变，对吗？
 随着年龄的增长，我们的生活已经到了一个阶段，我们不想看到太多的改变。
 但对我来说，我看到我们坐在一个可以真正接触历史事物的社区。
 我也不想让公共汽车和一群学童淹没我们的社区，或者大量涌入公共场所。
 但与此同时，这里有一个故事，我认为我们应该重视它。
 所以我的想法是，你知道，让我们按照我认为人们正在以深思熟虑、深思熟虑、面向社区的方式做这件事，而不是试图引入大量不必要的流量。
 但与此同时，这是一个可以对以下方面有用的领域：
 你知道布鲁克斯学校的孩子们喜欢在春天的某一天沿着街道散步并进行徒步旅行，在那里他们对这个地区的历史有更多的了解，我认为这对他们来说非常有价值。
 我和许多人一样，也许在这次会议上，不希望历史被遗忘。
 我希望这个故事能够被欣赏，而且我认为这艘船的建造和使用有一些非常有趣的事情。
 渠道和其他类似的东西可以具有真正的价值。
 这就是我要说的，但我很感谢所有这一切的关心和考虑。
 但我对变化也没有同样的担忧，只要它反映了社区和人们的理解，即这里有故事的真实部分，可以以安全和谦虚的方式讲述和探索。
 我感谢每个做自己正在做的事情的人。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5346.996s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 谢谢你，塔玛拉。
 还有没有发言但想要发言的人吗？
 有830个。
 我只是想记住时间并感谢所有来到这里并与我们一起度过 90 分钟的人。
 我再也没有看到有人举手了。
 我们走吧。
 对不起。
 有人想说话吗？
 还有人想发表评论吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5378.95s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 你好？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5382.413s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 你好，你想发表评论吗？
 是的，请。
 我可以知道您的姓名和地址以便注册吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5388.638s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 你好，比尔·史蒂文斯，韦尔盖特路。
 非常感谢。
 下一个。
 和其他人一样，我在这里住了大约 30 年。
 我有点担心，因为我认为你在没有与你的邻居或这个社区的居民交谈的情况下推进了整个项目。
 我也喜欢绿色空间。
 我喜欢神秘的湖泊。
 我喜欢我们那里的这个小公园。
 我不喜欢这种改变，但我看到他们正在努力让轮椅和残疾人更方便地进入公园，但我认为
 没有人真正考虑过在哪里可以停放 ADA 货车或在您提议的小巷上停放哪种类型的车辆。
 我查看了平面图，到目前为止我已经在小街上看到了两个停车位。
 谁能向我解释一下他们如何将 ADA 货车停在小街上并允许轮椅进出？
 在这个项目之前，有没有人想过 ADA 人行道实际上已经取得了进展？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5452.147s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 因此，我们的下一步是采用现有的方案设计，并与交通部门、DPW 和规划部门的工程师合作，真正深入研究这个问题的细节。
 你知道，这如何可行或不可行？
 将货车或 ADA 车辆停放在街道上或现场，您知道，某个地方，对吧？
 所以这些细节......你把警察放在丈夫之前。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5489.141s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 我们已经进行了所有这些对话以及所有这些分区法和附则变更，但您仍然没有弄清楚这个公园对残疾人士的无障碍程度。
 因此，我们通过允许汽车停放在公园来改变整个叙事。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5507.249s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 嗯，社区要求我们不允许汽车进入公园，但是当然......你不能把车停在小街上。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5512.773s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 我们需要 96 英寸宽。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5514.875s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 正确的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5515.315s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 所以其中一件事肯定是……你不能在人行道上的皮卡车侧面放置坡道。
 这是居民走道。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5525.148s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 嗯，我不确定，因为我们必须让工程师来查看它，但这是下一个过程的一部分，现在我们已经有了进行设计的资金。
 做好准备，以便我们至少可以向社区展示它们，以便我们得到这些具体的答案。
 你知道，这就是他。
 这个阶段的开始是有效的，对吗？
 当然，重点将放在解决安全问题、树木以及不再影响其他任何问题的考古问题上。
 我不会说，你知道，更多有争议的话题，对吧？
 因此，对于那些有争议的话题，我们有。
 你知道，至少在我们出去投标或建造之前六个月。
 所以，但我们想快速行动，对吧？
 然后，一旦我们有了这些设计，我们就可以将它们提交给社区以获得反馈。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5580.401s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 那么...让我们先结束一下。
 如果这些设计不起作用会发生什么？
 我们将团队三年或更长时间的资金花在一个无法推进的项目上。
 那么，在投入所有时间和精力继续前进之前，首先可行的是什么？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5595.956s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 所以这不是它是否有效的问题。
 这是让某些事情发挥作用的问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5601.962s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 就这样我在这里住了30年。
 我在那条街上看到了停车管理部门。
 我看到了
 警察试图放慢道路速度，设置减速带，那条路看起来就像高速公路。
 我每天上下班都要走15次这条路，带孩子去上班，然后去坐火车。
 这条路是高速公路。
 你放置这些标志、减速带，没有任何东西可以控制速度。
 是的，真的认为你可以放慢速度让坐轮椅的人去那里，
 有人会死。
 我认为你们没有考虑太多。
 都是死角。
 因此，在我们进一步讨论之前，我想在为这个项目花费比我实际需要的更多的税款之前认真考虑一下。
 我知道这是补贴
 我知道这一切是如何运作的。
 我知道这座城市正遭受着维修工人的痛苦。
 我们的预算中没有该房产的维护计划。
 我同意那位谈论树木的女士的说法。
 在附近，每栋房子前面的每一棵树都倒下了。
 每个房子都有腐烂的树。
 这是一片废弃的土地。
 我只是认为你们正在催促这项法案，尤其是这项法案中的残疾条款。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5683.977s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 谢谢比尔。
 非常感谢您的评论。
 我们一定会考虑到他们。
 好的，如果您想取消静音，请再联系一次 BNIC。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5697.584s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 嗯，我怎么样？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5699.865s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 是的，请继续，先生。
 我们可以得到您的姓名和地址以供注册吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5703.545s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 是的，我是来自牛顿路 3 号的鲍比·尼科特罗 (Bobby Nicotero)，我一直都在这里。
 凌晨一点左右，火车上的房子震动。
 几个晚上，然后，我的意思是，每个人在这里接触到的一切，对不起，我直接或间接经历过，我不得不说，当我们在 93 年搬到这里时，我的妻子发表了一个有趣的评论。
 她说，鲍勃，我在梅德福长大，上过梅德福高中，
 我以为我知道关于方法的一切，但我什至不知道玫瑰街，我以前从未来过这里。
 你说得再正确不过了。
 这是一个非常本地化、本地化的情况。
 我们对此非常敏感，因为我们住在一起，我住在隔壁。
 我看到了人们提到的所有事情。
 说实话，如果它改变了，那将是一种耻辱，因为这就是这个公园和这个社区给居住在这里的人们带来的魅力。
 人们喜欢这里。
 每个人都这样做。
 这是一个很棒的社区。
 但首先，约翰说得再正确不过了。
 我需要两个邻居告诉我今晚的会议，所以他们出于某种原因没有通知我。
 我不怪任何人。
 仅此而已
 现在是 2024 年，所以我知道这至少应该给格罗夫人，而且这些更好。
 但话又说回来，这是一个当地的公园。
 我很欣赏这个故事。
 除非我的孩子们和他们的朋友在街上闲逛，发现这个国家的这个地区有土著印第安人，否则我永远不会了解萨加莫尔公园。
 这个故事非常有趣，我们喜欢它。
 但它周围有一种魅力和对历史的热爱。
 人们对这一切反应非常好。
 但我必须说，格罗夫街就像一个超速手套。
 汽车似乎在快速加速或制动。
 不幸的是，格罗夫最近有一只狗被车撞死了。
 这非常非常悲伤。
 然后他回到了家。
 而且，你知道，我总是担心我的孩子会走过小树林，而我的狗会跑进小树林，因为害怕，你知道，汽车经过。
 当卡车停在减速带上时，您会听到碰撞声和东西从卡车上掉落的声音。
 所以所有这些事情加在一起，然后你就有了一个公园，更多的人停车、步行和参观。
 你知道，人行道很窄。
 无疑。
 如果我穿过那条人行道，在我格罗夫的房子前面，在那条土路上，它看起来，我想从技术上来说它可能看起来很宽，但当汽车经过你时，感觉并不宽。
 这是非常非常危险的。
 这是我最关心的问题。
 这是一条繁忙的街道，牛顿街和格罗夫街。
 这是一个非常繁忙的十字路口。
 或者卡车是新的，可以到处运送东西。
 人们总是转向那里，优步司机也转向那个角落。
 我同意这是一次本地旅行。
 我真的认为他们应该在很大程度上重新考虑这个条目。
 因为如果他们重新思考并获得更多信息，我的意思是，每个人都会像我一样对这篇文章感到困惑。
 这应该是经过深思熟虑的。
 应该有更多的贡献，因为这是本地的事情。
 我说花钱吧。
 现在花的钱与本来可以花的钱相比，根本不算什么，只是几美分。
 然后当然就是花钱了。
 明智地花钱。
 上次我检查时，速度没有那么快。
 所以一旦你设置了它，它就永远有效。
 这是历史性的。
 这就是为什么正确地做到这一点非常重要。
 所以我也像其他人一样受到直接影响。
 我们都在这里呆了一段时间了。
 我们都为这里的家园付出了很多努力，我们喜欢这里。
 这就是为什么我建议重新考虑在约翰家附近开设办事处。
 约翰在家工作很多，并且很好地照顾他的财产。
 对噪音采取一些措施。
 当你在后院时，基本上几年前，在新冠疫情之前，你听到的总是公共汽车、火车、
 当你在你的后院时有一架飞机。
 因此，任何利用树木和灌木作为植物的方法都是非常棒的。
 我的意思是，基本上就是这样，但速度就像牛顿和格罗夫的手套，这对我来说是最重要的因素。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6000.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 谢谢鲍比。
 非常感谢。
 我很高兴我们听到了您的评论。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6009.428s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 是的，Elyse Jennings，格罗夫街 94 号，奴隶墙前。
 感谢您召开这次会议并提供所有信息。
 我同意其中的许多内容。
 工作完成后的很多个夜晚，我醒来时都以为发生了地震。
 但我只是想提出一个尚未提出的观点。
 哦，顺便说一句，我是一名狗主人，在格罗夫街有一个年幼的儿子。
 但我想提出人行横道的问题。
 嗯，我理解无障碍的需求，这可能有助于减缓交通流量。
 我只担心太多标志或闪光灯的怪物。
 我不知道这些人行横道会是什么样子。
 我不知道我们真正需要多少。
 所以我只是想提出这一点，因为我以前没有听说过。
 我也想呼应信息的传播。
 我听说一位邻居知道我住在这里并告诉我这件事，我很幸运认识一些邻居，因为我已经在这里八年了，但我们有一些新邻居，他们还没有那么联系。
 因此，如果您能够更轻松地获取这些会议正在发生以及正在制定这些计划的信息，那就太好了。
 然后稍微评论一下奴隶墙和所有其他墙的建造时间。
 再说一次，说到不愉快的事情，我们面前有一个移动便盆。
 汽车会停下来，人们会使用便盆。
 工作完成后，它在那里呆了几个月，或者至少几周后。
 我不知道下一份工作是否会包括夜壶，但以防万一
 将其插入并确保其管理良好，这样我们就不必在那里停留比工作时间更长的时间。
 是的，这些只是我想发表的评论。
 谢谢。
 非常感谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6140.425s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 事实上，就是在那里窃听了会议信息。
 帖子，谢谢，我就是这样发现的，我在遛狗，有人把标牌钉在那里，所以谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6162.239s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 是的，我也是从邻居那里得知的，实际上是从黛安那里得知的，不幸的是不是从城里来的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6171.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 今晚在我们结束之前您还有其他意见吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6176.912s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 不，但我想明确表示，如果人们有地方可以获取信息，那么最好在给我们发电子邮件时告诉我们，例如，如果您有地方可去，我们会尝试在隔壁玩。
 呃，你知道，几年前有每个人都参与的雅虎聊天论坛。
 但是，您知道，如果现在出现类似的情况，我们很乐意尝试利用这些资源，以确保我们利用所有可用的资源。
 Jen，也许我们可以尝试，你知道，如果我们推进设计工作或类似的事情，如果我们再举行一次会议，也许你可以提出税收法案，你知道，这会产生影响。
 至少房子。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6217.961s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 是的，我想我和丹尼斯谈过水费单的问题。
 这只是很难。
 就像你必须正确接收电子邮件一样。
 不幸的是，我们并没有真正的预算，我们必须与市政府合作，尝试进行邮寄。
 所以，我们会听取您的意见，看看我们能做些什么，并尽力使其发挥作用。
 试着抓住他，你知道，也许我们会采取一些行动，
 你可以在附近散步。
 我们将会有一些想法，我们非常感谢今晚大家的评论。
 再次强调，如果您在本次会议后有任何想法，请给委员会发送电子邮件。
 这当然不是过程的结束。
 这是开始或中间，我们欢迎反馈。
 如果您想加入我们的邮件列表，请将您的邮件列表发送给我们，如果您给我们发送电子邮件，我们将确保您在我们的列表中。
 我们随时乐意接受意见和建议。
 所以一如既往地感谢。
 谢谢大家今晚的到来。
 感谢您在这里停留超过 90 分钟，我们下次再见。
 非常感谢。
 祝你晚安。</p>
