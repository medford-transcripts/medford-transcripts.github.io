    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=0.531s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Chúng tôi sẽ sớm xem xét quy hoạch tổng thể của công viên được phát triển vào năm 2020.
 Chúng tôi sẽ tóm tắt những gì đã đạt được cho đến nay trong giai đoạn đầu tiên.
 Điều này bao gồm việc khôi phục Bức tường Pomp, việc khôi phục Bức tường Fieldstone và các cuộc khai quật khảo cổ mà tôi biết một số bạn đã đến xem và tham gia, vì vậy xin cảm ơn các bạn.
 Chúng tôi có bản cập nhật kế hoạch chính mới.
 Vì vậy, trong các cuộc khai quật khảo cổ học, chúng tôi đã nhận được một số khuyến nghị cần được thực hiện.
 Đây thực sự là mấu chốt của buổi biểu diễn tối nay mà chúng tôi muốn chia sẻ với cộng đồng.
 Điều này thực sự sẽ giúp xây dựng lộ trình cho cái mà chúng tôi gọi là giai đoạn ba của công viên.
 Vậy là chúng tôi đã hoàn thành giai đoạn một, trong vài tháng tới chúng tôi sẽ bắt đầu giai đoạn hai, và bây giờ chúng tôi đang xây dựng lộ trình cho giai đoạn ba, mà chúng tôi gọi là những chặng đường lịch sử, những dấu hiệu nhất định, những cột mốc lịch sử nhất định.
 Một lần nữa, đây chỉ là những khái niệm chúng tôi sẽ chia sẻ với bạn tối nay.
 Chúng tôi vẫn chưa đảm bảo được nguồn tài trợ cho giai đoạn này và vẫn đang tìm kiếm phản hồi của cộng đồng.
 Nhưng theo một cách nào đó, bạn biết đấy, chúng ta đang bắt đầu giai đoạn hai và chúng ta phải nghĩ đến giai đoạn ba. Chúng tôi chỉ muốn tiếp tục tiến về phía trước với một số kế hoạch tổng thể.
 Và chúng tôi sẽ quay lại vào cuối để nói về giai đoạn hai và công việc trong tương lai, điều mà tôi biết nhiều bạn có thể hào hứng và chúng tôi đã nhận được tài trợ.
 Chúng tôi sắp bắt đầu gửi một số RFP tới các nhà cung cấp và công việc đó dự kiến ​​sẽ hoàn thành.
 Phần đầu tiên vào năm tới.
 Chúng tôi kết thúc bằng những nhận xét, câu hỏi và nhận xét.
 Chúng tôi vui lòng yêu cầu bạn hoàn thành bài thuyết trình trước khi trả lời các câu hỏi hoặc nhận xét để cuối cùng mọi người đều có cơ hội nói về điều họ mong muốn.
 Vì vậy từ giờ trở đi, tôi sẽ nhường phần trình bày cho Ryan Hayward và Peter Hedlund, những người sẽ thảo luận nội dung chính của bài thuyết trình.
 Thưa ngài, nó đây rồi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=149.076s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you, Jen, for that introduction, and I think Ryan's going to get the.
 Presentation up on the screen.
 Great.
 Thanks, Ryan.
 So everybody should be looking at just the title slide here.
 My name is Peter Headland, a landscape architect and a planner based in Arlington right next door.
 I was fortunate enough to work on the master plan project and have now been doing a little study on this concept design.
 And we'll talk about that shortly here.
 Okay, next slide.
 Great.
 The 2020 master plan, we started in 2019.
 It was almost a year process.
 It went through 2020.
 And that's all on the historical commission website.
 And at the end of that, we came up with a series of phased implementation projects that could happen over a period of
 20 years, and we'll talk about the first phase of that with the next slide.
 So this shows the first, say, seven of these implementation ideas that came out of the master plan, restoring the wall, the historic wall right on the edge of Grove Street.
 an archaeological dig at the estate, which has also taken place.
 We'll talk about that a little bit.
 Making improvements to the Grove Street edge, the fieldstone wall there.
 Those were in phase one and we'll go over those in a little bit.
 Other projects
 from the master planning include new crosswalks, improvements to the trails, some type of signage to identify the park, and some planting in this central planted LA.
 Okay, on the next slide, we'll talk about that.
 The first step and really the reason for this whole park is what's now known as Pomp's Wall.
 In 2019, the image on the upper left, that was the condition when we began the master plan and we had a historic masonry consultant, Richard Irons, come and maybe some of you heard him talk.
 He gave a presentation a number of years ago.
 He evaluated the wall.
 I wrote up a pretty detailed technical memo about the wall and went over some options to restore the wall.
 Some of you might know that a wall that part of the, in the deed when this part was given to the city of Medford, it stipulated that this wall, they were so proud of this wall, that this wall needed to be forever maintained.
 The preservation and restoration of this wall is really important or else technically, the old estate could take this part back over, but luckily, that's not going to happen.
 The middle slide there shows the previous joint conditions, pretty deteriorated and the capstone needed some significant repair.
 So, in the next slide, we show the process in 2023.
 Mason was hired to do that work.
 This is that restoration.
 A lot of the wall really had to be taken apart and put back together.
 And maybe some of you.
 were there or witnessed some of that progress.
 And the brick on the right side is pretty interesting.
 The contractor pulled that out and you can see a fingerprints on the top of that brick.
 So that's
 Pretty interesting, the wall was said to have been built in 1760, and so those are over 250 years old.
 Were they from Pompeii, the former enslaved person who built the wall?
 Perhaps Medford was known for local brick making and these bricks were sourced locally, but that's really sort of a neat glimpse of history and all those bricks went back into that wall.
 On the next slide, you can see the final result from last year of the newly restored wall with newly pointed bricks.
 They ended up putting a new cap on top of it to really seal that with flashing.
 Hopefully, this will last for the next few generations.
 Okay, so the next project that came out of the master plan in phase 1 was improving the Grove Street edge, the old field stone wall.
 It's an interesting historic image on the right hand side of the screen here, which shows it's looking up Grove Street.
 That is the
 historic wall, formerly known as the slave wall, now known as Pompe's wall.
 And you can see the wall as it was historically, but over time, it had sort of fallen apart in some areas more than others.
 The image on the left here is showing prior to the master plan, you know, the
 wall in this area was pretty gone, and so the thought there was to improve this fieldstone wall.
 And so the next slide shows the results of that.
 With the wall repaired, it really helps to define the edge of the park.
 Also, cutouts were left at intersections for crosswalks to access the park.
 And...
 Another part of that project was for five feet behind that wall, clearing out the understory, a lot of invasive plants have popped up in there.
 Clearing that out a little bit, let these big trees, you can see this one over on the right side, give them a little bit more room to grow.
 Ryan, at the end, we'll talk a little bit about some upcoming planting maintenance improvements.
 Okay, on the next slide, we talk about the third part of this first phase of projects coming out of the master plan, the archaeological dig at the estate.
 Here we see illustration of the Thomas Brooks house that was right behind that wall.
 This later colored here, that's that wall, that's Pomp's Wall.
 You can see the drive right behind it and what this house looked like.
 It was built in 1727.
 The house was demolished in 1860.
 Then it just really sat there because it was never redeveloped and became a park.
 The archaeologists we brought on for the master plan were determined, and they were correct, that this is a highly sensitive area for archaeological findings.
 And the master plan proposed an archaeological dig
 with a professional and to work collaboratively with community volunteers, and that happened.
 And they thought that there was the possibility to find, very good possibility to find both pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.
 And on the next slide, we see that dig, which happened in 2022 and 23.
 Maybe some people on this call, this Zoom meeting were part of that.
 You can see some of the people from the community along with the professionals working on that dig.
 There were 23 test pits and over 1,600 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 And post-contact and pre-contact mean either pre-contact is pre-colonial settlement and post-contact is after settlers arrived.
 So there was both interesting findings from both of those areas, which is pretty neat.
 And here's some of the things that were found.
 That piece of pottery was on that site.
 Okay, next slide please Ryan.
 So there is a pretty detailed survey report from the master plan that made some recommendations.
 They recommended to protect and preserve this site, specifically this estate site area.
 They thought it was a highly sensitive area in and around the house site, and that in this area, that any below ground disturbance should be avoided or ideally kept at a real minimum.
 And that will come into play when we talk about the concept for this area.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan.
 We see where that area is.
 This is the approximate house location.
 We're looking south on the dirt path.
 You can kind of see the back of Pomp's wall there.
 So that's generally where that house was.
 On the next slide, we have a couple images looking both south on that site.
 Some low vinca has grown up there.
 Maybe,
 A remnant from ground cover that was planted originally that could be possible.
 And then this is looking north.
 It was a pretty open site originally around that estate, but trees have have grown in over time.
 Okay, and the next slide.
 We see a couple other just context views of the north entrance.
 This is the newly reconstructed wall and the break in the wall at the roadway opposite.
 This is looking south on the south approach and you can see the open lawn there.
 These are the two ways that visitors would get to this area.
 Next slide.
 Okay, so we've been working for the last number of months and through a couple meetings on a design concept for this central area for this historically sensitive area, and I'll walk you through the main.
 Concepts here, and with the 3 big ideas for the design concept to improve accessibility to the park.
 And help identify the park as such as as a park and to make some of this really interesting history visible.
 I remember when I first started working on the master plan, and I.
 was out exploring the park, it's definitely not evident that it is or was a town-owned property.
 And so the improvements to the walls certainly help.
 And some simple signage will help to identify it as an important historical park for the town of Medford.
 So the first concept is a history wall.
 which is a, these paths really sort of already exist, they're dirt pathways, mostly, and creating a loop here in this thicker orange line that would help to connect
 a number of these historically sensitive areas and use historic markers to interpret the history a little bit.
 And we'll go through each of those.
 But these blue circles are those 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 markers there.
 Also, two potential areas for welcome signs to the park.
 We'll talk about the
 interpretation and stabilization measures around the former estate site.
 And you have to be able to get to the park, so new crosswalks and accessible parking.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan, we'll kind of walk through each of these.
 First is the history walk.
 The walk, again, in this thicker orange here, it would be an accessible path in terms of slope and surfacing.
 We haven't done a detailed, there hasn't been a detailed field survey done of this area of the park, but we think that it can be an accessible path below 5% slope.
 And we'd like to connect that to new crosswalks so people from this community, or maybe who are parking there could get into this park.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 There are 2 potential areas for welcome signs, and Ryan will talk a little bit more about this at the end.
 It would be great to identify the park, to name it, and to welcome visitors, to make them feel welcome.
 So here, opposite Jackson Road or potentially Ravine Road to the north are 2 potential areas for welcome signs.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 just a little bit history about Thomas Brooks Park.
 This is 1860 Brooks estate plan, which was pretty big.
 A lot of this land has since been given to the city of Medford.
 Our little sliver right there is Thomas Brooks Park.
 You can tell it's this almost like sharp triangle.
 Up on the upper right is
 at H.F.
 Walling Plan from 1855.
 And here we see our park there.
 It's easy to identify the railroad, which is this diagonal line, and then Grove Street.
 And so that sliver right there is what the future park looked like in 1855.
 It is adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.
 And then the six-acre park was conveyed to the city in 1924, again, with the stipulation that the
 brick wall, now known as Pomp's Wall, be forever maintained.
 On the next slide, we talk about these historic markers.
 Originally, in earlier iteration, this walk was just a linear path from here to here.
 But then as we took some feedback and evolved it a little bit, it's become more of a loop.
 Pomp's wall is right here just to orient everyone.
 It's great.
 And Grove Street is right here.
 So the proposal is to have a series of five simple historic markers so that visitors to the site would help to understand the rich history here a little bit better.
 Both the Native American history,
 which marker could be there, the African American history with this pretty remarkable wall, Pomp's Wall, that's just been restored.
 There's a pretty fascinating history of water systems and the Middlesex Canal here, and
 This is an appropriate place for that historic marker because it looks out over this lawn.
 We'll talk about that in a little bit.
 And then on the back of the park here, you're right next to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, now known as the MBTA Lowell Branch Railroad.
 which also has a rich history, and then coming around to the colonial American history of the site and the sort of remains of the Thomas Brooke estate and thinking about how to interpret and mark that.
 Okay, so over the next handful of slides, we move to the next one, we'll talk about how to do that and why that's important.
 So the Native American historic marker, again, with the archaic,
 I have a hard time saying that word today.
 With the dig that was just done, there were 64 pre-contact artifacts found collected during the 22-23 dig, which is pretty neat.
 Maybe some community members on this call or in this picture, I don't know.
 Largely, the items that were found were chipping debris and pottery shards.
 presumably from the middle to late Woodlands period, 2000 to 450 years ago.
 So pretty significant historical resource.
 And this has a potential for rich Native American history, given the proximity of water resources and the
 topography.
 So that's pretty invisible now, but it'd be great to make that history a little bit more visible, just with a simple interpretive marker.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we talk about Pomp's Wall.
 Okay, the existing marker, which is there, if you want to
 Sneak on the edge of the roadway and or peek at it from your car is shown on the upper right there.
 This upper left is a historic photo, which the date is unknown of, and the photo in the middle is from 1899.
 So you can look up Grove Street.
 You can see the wall, it's beginning to get overgrown there, but pretty open behind it, some of the big trees there.
 We know the wall was constructed around 1760, that the city is required to preserve and forever maintain it in that deed.
 to the city, it stipulates that.
 And then there was this recent, very important restoration and renaming of the wall.
 So that's an important history to help make visible.
 Okay, if we go to the next slide, we can help to mark in a way the importance of the Medford water systems.
 This picture on the left is a little hard to see.
 All these slides will be posted on the
 Historical Commission website.
 And if you look on there, there's a lot of information from the past number of years from all the studies and meetings that were done.
 This is a plaque elsewhere in Medford that shows the Middlesex Canal and the route.
 Our little park
 is right here.
 You can see the railroad and Grove Street.
 And so this Middlesex Canal was right to the south of this area.
 The Middlesex Canal was around from 1793 to 1853, ran from Charlestown to Lowell.
 It was partly financed by the Brooks family, which has such a prominent role.
 in the city of Medford.
 It supplied much of the lumber for shipbuilding in Medford.
 That was such a big industry in the city.
 On the lower right is an image of one of the bridges.
 There were a number of
 bridges, 50 bridges, all along the canal.
 And this was one in Medford that was taken down.
 But we think that some of these blocks were used in this Grove Street field stone wall, especially south of Pomp's Wall.
 You can go look and the stones there are more cut in.
 rectilinear blocks.
 I can't get into a lot of it here, but there's really a fascinating study that the head of the MWRA did on the role of Medford in the whole water and sewer development for the city of Boston in the nearby area.
 It's pretty fascinating.
 area where we're proposing this historic marker looking out on that field, well part of the reason the field is there and it's not overgrown is because there's a sewer easement that actually runs through there.
 And so there's a lot of interesting things to talk about for a potential historic marker talking about these water systems and the task will be how to distill this information in a concise way.
 Okay.
 If we go to the next slide, I talked a little bit about the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the proposals for historic marker on the backside of Thomas Brooks Park, talking about this, that this railroad was constructed in 1835.
 Also,
 partly financed by the Brooks family, the people didn't really want the railroad to happen, especially the people who were invested in the canal because the railroad made the canal not as necessary.
 And it essentially replaced the canal in order to speed up.
 Transportation provide year-round freight transportation because the canal would freeze in the winter.
 This railroad, it was the first major railroad in the state, one of the first in the whole Northeast, and it's still used today.
 It's an active rail line as the MBTA Lowell line.
 That's an image on the bottom right.
 You can see Boston and Lowell there.
 Okay, and Ryan, if you go to the next slide, the last historic marker kind of gets back to what we started with, with the dig on the site.
 Now, this is an image of the Brooks Estate House, and the historic marker would help to reinterpret that or interpret that history.
 that this house was built in 1727, you can see here there was a little curved driveway behind that brick wall.
 And that's essentially where, if you walk out there, where that dirt footpath is and where that history walk would be.
 Then you can see the brick wall between the street and the driveway, that's the palms wall.
 We know historically it was noted that there were three black walnut trees in front of the house.
 You can see them in this illustration and also those original trees aren't there.
 But if you're out there in that park, there are black walnut trees that are descendants, I think, of these original trees.
 Then as we know, there are a lot of artifacts recovered.
 from the dig over 1600 from the post-contact or colonial era.
 Okay, on the next slide, we looked at this site.
 This is the general area of that estate house, and the proposal is to both protect and preserve and interpret this site a little bit by marking the
 Corners of where the house was with simple stone blocks and stabilizing the surface with low plantings.
 And then this would be the blue circle that historic marker, which would be able to interpret it.
 So, if you go to the next slide.
 This was one of the site precedents that we looked at, Robbins Farm Park.
 It's a neat park right next door to Medford, up on the top of the hill.
 There's an old farm there.
 It was given to the city, turned into a park, and maybe probably 10 years or so ago,
 Park and Recreation Commission wanted to sort of memorialize the house in the former farm there.
 And so they put, they marked the foundation here with these stone blocks.
 These are kind of similar to what we're thinking for Thomas Brooks Park.
 And they had a simple sign in their case, it was right on the block.
 In our case, maybe it would be a separate standing element as a way to
 Talk about the former farmhouse that was there and give people a sense of that history a little bit.
 Okay, on the next slide we have another site that's interpreted the historic history, tracing the foundations of historic house.
 This is the Governor Winthrop House in Charleston, the great house site where they used found stones and some foundation stones and brought those to the surface and
 Trace that foundation there and then just a simple lawn is a very different setting their more urban area and more extensive historic sign that you can see on the bottom right.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 We also would like to stabilize the surface in a very simple way with ground cover planting.
 There's already a little bit of that there with a vinca that's taken over, naturalized the site a little bit.
 And on the next slide, we'd like to add to that a little bit with a nice native plant, gold star.
 It's native, shade-tolerant, a lot of trees around, pretty low, 6-12 inches tall, and has a nice bloom from the late spring into the fall.
 You can imagine walking on this path and coming across these blocks and a little burst of flowers might be a pretty elegant, beautiful, but yet subtle way to think about this site.
 On the next slide, we talked about another way that we could use plants to bring back the history.
 This is Syringa vulgaris, a common lilac, which is for hundreds of years been part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 And the quote on the bottom here is from the
 Medford paper in 1912, that some of the historic research which the state did, which predated the master plan, they pulled together, and I'll just read the quote, beside the street, Grove Street, and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 So they're talking about Palm's Wall and they're talking about Grove Street, which by the looks of this was originally bordered with lilac.
 So wouldn't it be neat, the upper right image is of the Arnold Arboretum on Lilac Sunday.
 Pro tip, that's a great place to go.
 Amazingly,
 blooms in the middle of May.
 We'd like to bring those lilacs back at the wall.
 On the next slide, we can see a picture of the wall.
 This is looking right up Grove Street and Palm's wall over on the right hand side with a field stone wall next to it.
 And on the next slide, just a little illustration of what some lilacs would look like right behind that wall.
 It would look pretty nice for vehicles or people on the sidewalk over on the other side here.
 It's a nice southern orientation there, southwest orientation.
 So I think those lilacs would do well.
 And at the same time, we could plant some, just a low ground cover on the roadside to help stabilize that embankment there.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we have a look at the existing conditions behind Pompe's wall and up that path so this would be the history walk and then the next slide shows a little illustration of
 what that might look like with some lilacs over on the side in this simple walkway that would then loop around with a series of historic markers and then the stone blocks at the estate house to give a deeper understanding of the rich history of this site.
 Okay, on the next slide, I believe we're hopping into some information Ryan from the historical commission can share on the upcoming improvements for the second phase at the park.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=1938.088s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 好吧，现在我只想快速深入了解第二阶段的构建更新。
 因此，重申一下 Jen 在开头所说的，我们有 2020 年总体规划，但该文件是一份动态文件，可能会发生变化。
 这将会发展。
 因此，无论总体规划中有什么内容，我相信你们中的一些人已经读过，我们使用的分期与施工中所需的分期不同。
 因此，对于这个资助阶段，完全得益于社区保护委员会的慷慨资助，我们打算进行更大规模的考古挖掘，我们打算根据《美国残疾人法案》的要求修剪一些树木并清除枯木，
 通往路边切口、人行道和停车位的建筑通道。
 我们试图通过标记和张贴一些标志来识别十字路口，然后，当然，我们试图将这个地方识别为公园。
 有几件事正在考虑中。
 当然，我们正在关注彼得刚才谈到的这个考古前沿，它正处于早期规划阶段。
 当然，我们正在考虑诸如改善步道清晰度、添加适合场地的树木以及在植树时进行一些灌木修剪和侵入式割草等措施。
 但当然，没有考虑到什么，我们很久以前在公众会议上就听说过，现在我们听到，即使在总体规划中，我们也没有以任何方式考虑社区花园或铁路桥。
 所以我要把这个放在一边，这样人们就知道我们正在考虑的是对公园影响较小的事情，好吗？
 因此，对于考古学，我们打算聘请一位考古学家来探索托马斯·布鲁克斯故居的遗址以及居住在那里的人们，包括布鲁克斯家族及其雇用的员工。
 这是一个鲜为人知的话题，但已被探索过。
 该遗址与新英格兰的奴隶制有很多联系，因此它是一个非常重要的地方。
 所以，在做出任何限制之前
 为了永久保护该遗址，我们希望完成对此事的考古尽职调查。
 我们将寻找社区志愿者，就像上次一样，我们可以让人帮助我们筛选土壤和对文物进行实验室工作，以便人们可以看到它们。
 所以我们一定会为此努力。
 我们考古部分的工作将是我们希望在两者之间设置的限制
 你知道，佩德罗的历史之旅以及对房子和解释面板的解释以及所有这些都是为了保护这个网站免受任何负面影响。
 有很多树木修剪工作要做。
 为此，我们正在研究与该地点 50 棵树龄约 150 年的树木相关的最直接问题。
 其中，保存状况较好的古树有30株。
 他们需要修剪，就像修剪灯一样，只是为了去除一些枯枝，一些领导者折断了，但有10
 公园内和周围的树木完全死了。
 您可以在右侧看到这张图片，其中他们的领导人完全分裂，什么都没有留下，为了公共安全，这些树必须被移除。
 在其他图像中，例如最左边的图像，您可以看到领导者已经分开并摇摇欲坠地悬挂在一些小路上。
 所以我们正在寻找
 将它们全部修剪，使婴儿围栏从一端到另一端都牢固。
 还有两棵入侵的挪威枫树已经完全死亡。
 它们高耸于这个地方。
 他们身高约20英尺，但只有15岁。
 我们希望将其移除，因为任何大小如此之大的树都会造成滋扰，并且会绕过 MBT​​A 的通行权。
 但随着树木的修剪，
 我们希望种植 15 棵新树。
 我说的是橡树，但与城市树木管理员交谈时，它可能是橡树，也可能是糖枫树，这些树原产于新英格兰，也原产于这个地方，我们希望取代这里的入侵性挪威枫树，我们有计划继续种植可以治愈的树木，可以这么说，以便公园成为一个公园并保持森林的感觉。
 现在，作为该项目的一部分，最重要的关键部分之一是我们希望清除整个场地中的所有死木。
 所以我们知道，当格罗夫街发生冰暴时，一些枯木被从街上移走。
 DPW 破坏了这一点。
 让我们完成这项工作吧。
 当然，出于公共安全原因，在隔离墙期间也砍伐了几棵树。
 所有这些都将被消除。
 然后，所有即将死亡或死去的历史树木的各种树便将从公园的一端移至另一端。
 所以这将是一次从上到下的彻底清洁。
 大部分此类材料如果太大，将会从网站上删除。
 如果再小一点的话
 它可以被压碎，我们会将其中一些放回到道路上，这样道路上就有了一些定义。
 为了改善无障碍环境，我们在整个公园内分布了多个设施。
 最重要的是，我们将重新连接格罗夫街东侧的人行道（目前终止于牛顿街）至杰克逊路的新入口。
 我们将在所有墙壁开口处切割人行道。
 Jackson Road、Gravine Road和Layard Road将设有条纹人行道。
 人行横道处将设有指示牌。
 当然，所有这一切都需要很长时间，因为有很多重要的参与者。
 所以我们正在探索和研究设计和概念，但是当我们开始推进这个项目时，城市的公共工程部门、交通部门都必须介入。
 所以我们才刚刚开始，还有很多很多个月的时间。
 但我们希望也许能在 2025 年春季开始施工，这样我们就可以基本上以正确的方式开始新的一年，并在冬季后的第一个可能的施工期间，我们将开始并交付我们已经工作了一年多的这些东西。
 为了获得空间，它们需要在附近的某个地方标记为无障碍路线和公园周围无障碍路径的一部分，即一个停车位。
 当我们最初制定总体规划时，我们被要求禁止汽车进入公园。
 因此，我们必须在某处提供 ADA 无障碍空间。
 我们将与居民以及你们所有人合作，尝试将其安置在一个对无障碍路线和居民都方便的位置。
 但它还要求该市与交通部门举行公开听证会。
 因此，将会有很多很多的机会来解决这个空间适合什么地方以及如何适合的问题。
 当然，
 想法改变了。
 有访问权。
 这并不可取，但如有必要，我们可以将停车位移回原位。
 对于人行道标记，我们希望保持简单。
 你知道，一条简单的油漆人行道就可以了。
 标牌尽量减少。
 前几天我们和交通部门谈过。
 也许人们更喜欢明亮的标志（如果有的话），那就是杰克逊路。
 那里有大量人群集中穿过公园的正门，这甚至可能是居民上下学的安全路线。
 但根据我们听到的反馈，这有待讨论。
 然后是公园标牌。有两种不同类型的公园标牌。
 有欢迎您参加历史之旅的标牌和解说标牌。
 但实际上，在这个阶段，我们试图将公园识别为公园。
 我们希望在同一条街上有类似布鲁克斯庄园标志的东西。
 该网站与
 归布鲁克斯庄园所有，但可能有自己的身份。
 所以我们还没有真正的设计，但我们确实有一些东西可以将其标识为具有一定历史的城市公园，以便每个人都知道它不仅仅是一片废弃的森林，它实际上是梅德福的一个重要场所。
 当然，通过持续的规划，我们正在考虑将一些事情作为该项目的一部分，这些事情将导致其他项目。
 我们有关于树木的历史工作。
 有一次，我们想打开一条种满橡树和黑胡桃木的小巷。
 或许可以减少一些入侵的挪威枫树。
 但我们正在倾听，我们了解到目前植被的作用就像一种声幕。
 因此，作为其中的一部分，我们会讨论种植一些树木，以便随着现有景观的缩小，更大、更合适的树木可以增加尺寸。
 并且这个声音缓冲区始终被维护。
 但同样，这是后期阶段，有很多很多很多淘汰。
 但最大的问题是，正在进行的一些树木修复工作将减轻对 MBTA 围栏的损坏。
 因此，我们将让 MBTA 与我们合作修复围栏，确保公园安全，最终确保没有人能够跨越铁道床。
 这就是我们第二阶段工作的核心。
 所以我们知道您有意见和问题。
 因此，我认为如果您想发表评论或对我们有任何疑问，我们很乐意回答。
 我们只是要求人们举手。
 当然，今晚没有必要发表所有评论。
 这并不是一切的结束。
 我们将尽力继续考古实地工作，这不是
 除了出于安全原因进行挖掘、封顶和一些树木工作之外，对公园有任何影响，但其余工作将在六个月内再次完成该项目，因此，如果您知道稍后会出现问题，并且如果您想花一些时间消化今晚听到的内容并将其放入其中，我们将接受评论并很高兴收到电子邮件
 当然，正如我在会议开始时所说，如果我们没有您的电子邮件，如果您不在我们的联系人列表中，请向我们发送电子邮件，我们将很乐意将您添加到我们的电子邮件和广告中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2629.627s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn, Ryan.
 Cảm ơn, Pedro.
 Như Ryan đã nói, tôi rất vui được mở ra không gian cho những nhận xét hoặc câu hỏi vào lúc này.
 Nếu ai có việc gì muốn giơ tay thì tôi sẽ gọi.
 Tamara, nếu bạn muốn hồi phục.
 Nick, chúng tôi có thể biết địa chỉ đăng ký của bạn không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2651.095s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Đúng.
 14 Newton Road, West Medford, phía nam Công viên Thomas Brook.
 Tóm lại, tôi chỉ muốn cảm ơn mọi người đã quan tâm, lắng nghe cộng đồng và cảm ơn họ vì những nỗ lực, chăm chỉ trong việc bảo tồn lịch sử và sự độc đáo của khu vực này.
 Tôi chỉ muốn cảm ơn bạn.
 Rõ ràng, bài thuyết trình của bạn cần rất nhiều công sức.
 Bạn rõ ràng lắng nghe cộng đồng và tôi yêu những gì bạn đang làm và thực sự đánh giá cao nó.
 Cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều vì đã làm việc chăm chỉ.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2683.696s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 Dave, nếu anh muốn hồi phục, tôi có thể nhìn thấy bàn tay của anh.
 Chúng tôi có thể lấy tên và địa chỉ của bạn để đăng ký không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2691.141s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Vì vậy, câu hỏi của tôi là: họ đã cân nhắc điều gì chưa?
 Những gì đang xảy ra đã xảy ra rất lâu trước khi chúng tôi sống ở đây, những người đi đến công viên chỉ cắt ở đó và phía bức tường của chúng tôi vẫn chưa hoàn thành.
 Đối với những người sống ở đây, điều này hơi khó chịu.
 Nhiều người chỉ đơn giản là cắt cỏ, cắt cỏ, cắt vỉa hè.
 Quan điểm của tôi là nếu phần bức tường này không được hoàn thành, những người ở phía đường của chúng tôi lên tới High Street, mọi người trong khu vực đó, sẽ tiếp tục đi qua khu đất của chúng tôi và Khu Brooks Estate theo cách đó.
 Sẽ có ít người đạt được tất cả các mục tiêu của bạn hơn với các mục tiêu khác nhau
 Ồ, bạn biết đấy, địa điểm, hội trường và tất cả những thứ đó.
 Vì vậy, tôi không biết đã có ai nói đến việc hoàn thiện phần tường đó bên phía chúng tôi chưa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2766.663s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Vì vậy, tôi có thể bình luận và Ryan cũng có thể muốn tham gia.
 Chúng tôi nghe thấy rất nhiều bình luận ở phía bên kia bức tường.
 Đây là lý do tại sao địa điểm này bị đóng cửa vì chính xác những lý do bạn đã nêu, bởi vì mọi người đang băng qua khu đất tư nhân để vào công viên.
 Do đó và tầm nhìn từ góc độ giao thông, khoảng trống sẽ tăng lên để qua đường dễ dàng hơn.
 Bây giờ chúng ta biết rằng việc phải chạy ngoằn ngoèo từ bên này sang bên kia là không lý tưởng.
 Vì vậy, trong giai đoạn tiếp theo chúng tôi sẽ mở rộng vỉa hè cùng bên đường lên phần mở hiện có để người dân không phải băng qua bên này sang bên kia.
 Dave, họ cũng không cần phải băng qua đường lái xe của bạn và vào khu đất của bạn để đến khu vực công viên cỏ.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi đang giải quyết vấn đề này, chúng tôi hiểu và lắng nghe những nỗi thất vọng của người dân ở cuối Phố Grove và trong những con hẻm này, đồng thời chúng tôi đang cố gắng giúp những người trên con phố đó không phải băng qua đường hai lần dễ dàng hơn.
 Ryan, cứ thoải mái nhảy vào đi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2841.618s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Vâng, chúng tôi chỉ, bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi chắc chắn muốn xây dựng vỉa hè đó.
 Chúng tôi cố tình để bức tường cách xa 5 feet chỉ để đảm bảo có chỗ cho lối đi.
 Bạn biết đấy, sẽ có một cái cây ở bên bức tường cong nên nó biến mất.
 Tôi nghĩ có biển báo tăng tốc độ cần phải điều chỉnh.
 Nhưng sau đó có một cuộc đi bộ vui vẻ và thân thiện đến lối vào chính.
 Rõ ràng nếu có một số biển báo trên phần đường dành cho người đi bộ, nếu chúng ta đặt một số biển báo có đèn, có thể nói, để mọi người biết rằng vào ban đêm hoặc khi có ít ánh sáng thì đây là đường dành cho người đi bộ thì việc đi vào cổng chính của công viên và công viên sẽ rõ ràng hơn.
 bạn biết đấy, bây giờ
 Đó là con đường của sự mong muốn, nhưng nếu chúng ta cung cấp cho mọi người một giải pháp thay thế sạch sẽ và được bảo trì tốt, nó sẽ dần dần thành công.
 Cũng như đầu bên kia của công viên, chúng tôi đã đóng cửa đầu kia của Cầu Đường sắt Grove Street vì lý do an toàn công cộng.
 Cư dân lại trèo tường như mọi người vẫn làm, nhưng mọi thứ dường như đã tự giải quyết.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi nghĩ rằng điều đó cũng sẽ xảy ra theo thời gian.
 Giải quyết nó một mình.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2930.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Zoe, tôi thấy bàn tay của bạn.
 Nếu bạn có thể cho chúng tôi biết tên và địa chỉ đã đăng ký của bạn.
 Đúng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2935.229s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Tôi là Zoe Moutsos ở số 33 Đại lộ Johnson.
 Xin chào Dave.
 Hàng xóm của Dave.
 Tôi là kẻ xâm phạm tài sản của bạn trong công viên.
 Tôi muốn nói về cư dân trên đảo trong tương lai của Taylor và Johnson.
 Đó là lý do tại sao chúng tôi làm điều này.
 Trong kế hoạch ban đầu, tôi thấy một lối vào trên Đường Newton sẽ rất tốt.
 Tôi không biết tại sao nó lại bị dỡ bỏ hoặc tại sao nó không xảy ra, nhưng chúng tôi sống ở một khu vực của Medford, nơi không dễ dàng tiếp cận không gian xanh.
 Con cái chúng tôi phải băng qua nhiều con đường đầy sợ hãi.
 Để bắt đầu trò đùa, anh ấy nói rằng chúng tôi thực sự đã băng qua đường ray rồi rẽ phải trên đường để đến công viên nhỏ này.
 Bạn biết đấy, chúng ta phải băng qua đường trừ khi có thể đi bộ đến cửa hàng tạp hóa và công viên.
 Bạn biết đấy, chúng ta đang đi qua Phố Grove, giống như đường cao tốc.
 Vì thế tôi nghĩ đó là lý do.
 Đó là lý do tại sao tôi không nhớ Ryan đã sử dụng ngôn ngữ gì, đó là lý do tại sao mọi người lại đi theo hướng đó và đó là lý do tại sao chúng tôi rất thất vọng khi kế hoạch không được thực hiện thông qua việc kết thúc.
 Tôi nghĩ chúng ta có thể làm gì đó ở đó, chặt một số cây và cho người vào và không đi bộ trên đất của Dave, vì tôi biết điều đó không phải vậy,
 Nhiều phương án không lý tưởng, nhưng vẫn có các lựa chọn là họ chạy khi tham gia giao thông và đi bộ trên đường mòn cùng trẻ em và chó trong bóng tối và ánh sáng yếu. Tôi nghi ngờ con đường đủ rộng để tuân thủ ADA.
 Tôi không thể tưởng tượng được nó là như vậy.
 Bây giờ nó đầy lỗ, đầy kính, thực sự,
 Hầu hết công viên này đều đẹp và tôi biết nó sẽ rất tuyệt vời khi được xây dựng, nhưng trên Đại lộ Johnson, ít nhất đối với tôi, đó là một sự thất vọng lớn, và tôi biết những người khác trong khu vực về cơ bản lại bị mắc kẹt trên xa lộ với những người chạy quá tốc độ.
 Và chúng tôi không thể đến được không gian xanh gần nhất.
 Vì vậy tôi đoán điều tôi đang nói là có lẽ chúng ta có thể cân nhắc việc xây dựng Đường Newton.
 Ngoài ra, ngoài tất cả những lời phàn nàn của tôi về điều này, cảm ơn vì đã lắng nghe.
 Có rất nhiều kẻ xâm nhập vào công viên này.
 Có mụn cóc đen, mù tạt tỏi, cây thường xuân độc, nếu cần, như thể những kẻ xâm lược không chỉ là người Na Uy, phải không?
 Vì vậy, tôi đang tự hỏi: liệu có phương án nào để đối phó với những kẻ xâm nhập này khi có người ở ngoài đó không?
 Bởi vì, chúa ơi, hai năm qua mù tạt tỏi, nếu bạn thích thứ đó,
 Công viên sạch sẽ.
 Tôi không biết chúng ta đang nói về cái gì.
 Chúng tôi không thực sự tập trung vào khu vực này trong bản demo này, nhưng nếu bạn nhìn kỹ, khu đất trống ở Đường Newton giờ đây gần như bị bao phủ hoàn toàn bởi mù tạt tỏi và mụn cóc đen.
 Điều này sẽ chỉ tiếp tục trở nên tồi tệ hơn.
 Dù sao, cảm ơn.
 Tôi biết điều đó sẽ tốt, nhưng tôi thực sự muốn xem xét việc tiếp cận an toàn và thực tế là Phố Grove thực sự nguy hiểm.
 Mọi người lái xe rất nhanh trên con đường này.
 Cảm ơn</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3125.498s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn Zõe.
 Tôi cũng sống trên phố Grove nên tôi có thể nghe rõ bạn.
 Tôi muốn nói chuyện với John Ardizzone vì tôi đã thấy bạn giơ tay, tôi đã thấy điều đó trước đây và tôi biết bạn không sử dụng tay trên Zoom.
 Vì thế tôi chỉ đang cố ngăn cản bạn giơ tay.
 Vì vậy, John, nếu bạn muốn cất cánh và chúng tôi có thể lấy tên và địa chỉ của bạn để đăng ký, vui lòng liên hệ với chúng tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3147.976s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: John Art sống ở số 53 Đại lộ Johnson chỉ trong 30 năm.
 Vậy là tôi biết toàn bộ câu chuyện về công viên này.
 Tôi sở hữu số 69 phố Grove.
 Người thuê nhà của tôi là David.
 Mọi người đang băng qua đường lái xe của tôi để đi đến công viên và đó không phải là điều đáng lẽ phải xảy ra.
 Đáng lẽ nó phải đóng cửa.
 Đó chỉ là một câu hỏi.
 Vấn đề khác là khi bạn kiếm được nhiều tiền thì con phố đó lại có rất nhiều xe cộ qua lại và bạn càng ngày càng có nhiều xe cộ qua lại trên đó.
 Điều khác là chúng ta đang nói về những người mang theo trẻ em.
 Về mặt kỹ thuật, đây là một công viên dành cho chó.
 Tôi là một trong số họ và tôi đã ở đây lâu hơn bất kỳ ai khác trong bức ảnh này.
 Peter, Ryan, bất kỳ ai trong số họ đều đến.
 Họ không ở đó lâu như tôi.
 Tôi đã ở đó khi đó là khu vườn chiến thắng và khu vườn cộng đồng.
 rất đẹp
 Điều bạn đang nói là khi họ xây bức tường, họ đã phá hủy tất cả cây cối phía sau bức tường.
 Những người xây bức tường đã phải nâng nó lên rất cẩn thận, giống như cách họ làm phía trên siêu thị.
 Những kẻ này chỉ cần đánh nó đi.
 Họ đã làm một đống đá.
 Một điều nữa là bạn nói tầm nhìn của bạn rất nhạy cảm.
 Họ lấy từ 5 đến 10 tảng đá cao 3/4 inch từ gara của tôi, tách chúng ra và ném ra vườn.
 ĐƯỢC RỒI?
 Đá này nên được sử dụng làm nền tảng cho bức tường đẹp đẽ này được xây dựng.
 Họ không bao giờ sử dụng bất kỳ loại đá nào.
 Khi làm xong, họ bước vào với một cái xẻng và san phẳng mọi thứ.
 Tôi làm việc trong khu vực.
 Tôi đã làm việc trong lĩnh vực này được 30 năm.
 Tôi biết câu chuyện của anh ấy.
 Bạn đang nói về kênh đào và các cuộc khai quật khảo cổ.
 Thành phố, thành phố, ở đó để cắt cỏ và phá hủy nơi này trong nhiều năm.
 Phố Grove từng rất yên tĩnh.
 Bây giờ tất cả những gì bạn phải làm là lắng nghe âm thanh của tàu trong khi dọn dẹp tất cả rác rưởi xung quanh những viên đá này.
 Bạn phải thực sự đi vào và cắt 20 feet phía sau bức tường đó và đánh sập tất cả các bức tường ở đó.
 Họ đã không bắt đầu theo cách đó.
 Khi họ bắt đầu xây dựng cây cầu, họ đã làm cho nó đẹp đẽ và sạch sẽ.
 Lúc đầu họ thậm chí còn sử dụng đá.
 Tôi làm việc trong ngành xây dựng.
 tôi biết
 Khi bạn đã đi được một phần ba chặng đường, hãy quên đi những tảng đá.
 Hãy quên đi việc đi bộ trong rừng.
 Họ chỉ phá hủy mọi thứ.
 Giờ đang hỗn loạn.
 Tất cả những gì bạn cần làm là dọn dẹp công viên.
 Ồn ào, say khướt, muốn lấy ví của người ta.
 Nhưng vấn đề là tất cả những người này đang nói về việc nó tuyệt vời như thế nào.
 Họ không ở lại xung quanh.
 Điều này không ảnh hưởng đến họ.
 Bạn đã mở ra một con đường mòn.
 Bạn tôi Mike David, vợ anh ấy là cháu gái tôi.
 Có người đang dắt chó đi dạo ở đó vào lúc 10 giờ đêm.
 Không có trẻ em và những đứa trẻ duy nhất chơi trong công viên này sống trong ngôi nhà gần 69 Grove.
 Họ ở ngoài kia, họ là những đứa trẻ khúc côn cầu.
 Không có trẻ con ở đó, đó là công viên dành cho chó.
 Chà, tất cả những điều này thật điên rồ.
 Bạn đang nói về một nơi tuyệt vời mà bạn muốn giữ sạch sẽ và gọn gàng.
 Bạn đã bỏ đi cứt chó trong ba mươi năm.
 Không ai biết lịch sử của tài sản.
 Bạn đang nói về lịch sử, về nước.
 Một tuyến đường cấp nước của Massachusetts đi qua đó.
 Gần nhà tôi có một khu đất MBTA.
 Tôi là đồng tác giả thực sự duy nhất của tài sản này.
 Bạn chưa bao giờ cảnh báo tôi.
 Giống như, tại sao?
 Tôi đã nói chuyện với sở giao thông vận tải.
 Bạn có thể đặt một lối băng qua đường ở cuối đường lái xe của tôi không?
 Vậy điều gì xảy ra khi ai đó bỏ cuộc?
 Nếu họ quay lại, họ sẽ lại đến được lối qua đường dành cho người đi bộ.
 Trừ khi có yêu cầu khác, lối băng qua đường phải được bố trí trong phạm vi 120 feet tính từ các tòa nhà hiện có.
 Anh ấy không cần nó.
 Bạn có thể đi bộ được không? Mọi người có thể đi bộ được không? Họ đang đi đâu vậy?
 Bạn đang nói và những người khác đang nói đó là nơi duy nhất dành cho trẻ em.
 Medford có nhiều không gian xanh hơn.
 Con trai tôi là một con vật hoang dã.
 Khám phá tất cả các không gian xanh mà thành phố có.
 Chúng tôi có nhiều không gian xanh hơn ở Medford, Mystic Lake và Brooks Estates.
 Phía sau phải có 100 mẫu đất.
 Bạn phải băng qua đường để đến được không gian xanh.
 Những người sống ở Tây Medford rất may mắn.
 Kết quả là họ phá hủy nó bằng cách làm như vậy.
 Vào và dọn sạch công viên.
 Lối vào của tôi, tại sao bạn không hoàn thành nó?
 Bạn xây một bức tường, xây một vỉa hè, nhặt nó lên và cử người của bạn vào ngày mai để hoàn thiện bức tường.
 Tại sao bạn không làm điều đó?
 Bạn nghĩ nếu bạn ở Siêu thị 69 và có ai đó tông vào xe bạn khi bạn đang đi ra ngoài, bạn sẽ phát điên.
 Lúc 10 giờ tối đã có người dắt chó đi dạo.
 Nó không ở sân sau của bạn nên nó sẽ không làm phiền bạn.
 Ai đó sống trên đường Jackson, Tyler và John.
 Không ai trong số những người này ở lại đó lâu như tôi.
 Tôi đã ở đó và chưa bao giờ gặp vấn đề gì.
 Khu phố đẹp.
 Rừng hồi đó đẹp hơn bây giờ.
 Bạn đã không bảo vệ họ trong những năm này.
 Thỉnh thoảng, bạn cắt cỏ.
 Lối mở này, lối vào này, là một lối mở nhỏ.
 Điều xảy ra là họ đã dỡ bỏ tảng đá lớn để có thể đặt máy cắt cỏ vào đó.
 Đó là cách mọi chuyện bắt đầu.
 Tôi sở hữu ngôi nhà này từ năm 2003 và sống trên Đại lộ Johnson được 30 năm.
 Tôi vừa bán nhà nhưng vẫn sở hữu 69 cửa hàng tạp hóa.
 Tôi đã liên lạc rồi.
 Sở giao thông đang đến.
 Họ không muốn vấn đề.
 Chúng tôi chưa bao giờ gặp bất kỳ vấn đề nào trên Johnson Blvd.
 Một đoạn khác của Đại lộ Johnson nơi gặp cửa hàng tạp hóa đã bị phá hủy.
 Họ đã phá hủy khu vực này.
 Ở đó chưa bao giờ có tai nạn nào cả.
 Juan, cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều vì bình luận của bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3494.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bây giờ tôi cần chuyển sang một số ý kiến ​​khác.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3496.549s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Lẽ ra bạn nên cảnh báo tôi.
 Bạn chưa bao giờ cảnh báo tôi.
 Tôi là người hàng xóm duy nhất.
 Tôi sẽ không bao giờ thông báo cho bạn.
 Tôi nhận được thông báo từ hàng xóm của tôi.
 Bạn có biết họ làm gì không?
 Bạn có thể móc túi người khác.
 Nó không ở sân sau của bạn nên nó sẽ không làm phiền bạn.
 Thế thôi.
 Bạn muốn cây phát triển mạnh.
 Bạn đang tìm kiếm đồ vật và những người này phá hủy nơi đó và bạn nói nó là thứ gì đó tế nhị.
 Tôi sẽ cho phép bạn đến dinh thự của tôi với 510 bánh xe bằng đá và gửi chúng đến đó mà không cần hỏi tôi.
 Anh ta có cảnh sát.
 Họ nói, này, nếu họ làm hỏng đường lái xe, họ phải sửa nó.
 Ai cho phép điều này?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3532.841s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Juan, cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều.
 Xin lỗi tôi phải đi đến bình luận khác.
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 Frank, tôi nhìn thấy bàn tay của bạn, nếu bạn có thể biết được tên và địa chỉ của mình thì bạn là người tiếp theo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3545.777s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Vâng, cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều, Frank Miller.
 John nói, tôi sống ở 56 Grove, nên tôi là hàng xóm.
 Vì vậy tôi sống gần công viên, gần hơn nơi John sống.
 Cháu trai tôi chơi ở đó suốt.
 Anh ấy 10 tuổi.
 Anh ấy đã sử dụng nó rất nhiều.
 Tôi cũng thấy những đứa trẻ khác ở đó nên tôi biết nó đã được sử dụng.
 Tất nhiên, mọi người cũng dắt chó đi dạo ở đó, nhưng ngoài điều đó ra, chỉ có một vài điều.
 Trước hết xin cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều.
 Tôi nghĩ đây là một cải tiến đáng kể.
 Tôi rất vui vì bạn đã làm sáng tỏ mọi thứ.
 Với toàn gỗ chết và cây chết, tôi luôn lo lắng chúng sẽ bốc cháy.
 Vì vậy, đây là một cải tiến lớn.
 Tôi yêu mọi thứ bạn làm.
 Điều duy nhất tôi hơi thất vọng là vì tôi nghĩ trong quy hoạch ban đầu bạn nói sẽ có vỉa hè màu xám, nhưng có vẻ như bạn đã bỏ điều đó rồi.
 Vậy liệu nó còn có thể được không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3602.83s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Vì vậy, chúng tôi đã thảo luận về việc xây dựng các lối đi dành cho người đi bộ trên cao với sở giao thông vận tải, vấn đề là việc này liên quan đến việc lắp đặt các bể chứa khiến chi phí tăng thêm rất lớn.
 Nếu nó chưa có ở đó.
 Trong hầu hết các trường hợp, chúng tôi khuyên bạn nên lắp đặt lối băng qua đường ở vị trí không có lối băng qua đường gần đó.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi tập trung vào những rào cản hiện có.
 Chúng ta có thể sử dụng lưu lượng truy cập để thử thêm một lưu lượng khác.
 Một điều khác mà chúng tôi đã thảo luận với họ là có thể tạo ra một khu vực an toàn ở rìa công viên để giới hạn tốc độ sẽ không còn là 25 km/h qua thị trấn. Giống như 20 dặm một giờ.
 Nhưng chúng tôi biết mọi người chạy quá tốc độ trên con đường này, tầm nhìn là một vấn đề và một số người muốn giảm tốc độ để giữ an toàn.
 Chúng tôi biết đó là một lối tắt để đến những nơi nhất định.
 Tôi đã tự mình lái xe đến đây từ những vùng khác của Medford, nhưng có lẽ yêu cầu mọi người giảm tốc độ sẽ giúp an toàn hơn.
 Có lẽ thậm chí sử dụng nó với tín hiệu sẽ giúp ích.
 Làm cho nó an toàn hơn một chút.
 Nhưng nếu chúng ta có thể xây cầu vượt, chúng ta sẽ làm.
 Nhưng ngoài điều đó ra, chúng tôi sẽ làm ngược lại và đảm bảo cả hai bên đều có thể tiếp cận được các đường dốc.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3693.153s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Cảm ơn rất nhiều.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3695.935s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn, Frank.
 Hẹn gặp lại lần sau Diana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3705.668s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Chào, Diane Noel.
 Tôi sống ở số 11 đường Newton, One House Inn đối diện công viên.
 Tôi nghĩ tôi đồng ý với tất cả những người phát biểu ở đây, ít nhất ở một khía cạnh nào đó, đó là cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều vì bài phát biểu này.
 Tôi rất ấn tượng và tự hào vì chúng tôi đang nhìn vào lịch sử của Medford và suy nghĩ sâu sắc về nó.
 Vì vậy, cảm ơn bạn đã làm công việc này.
 Giống như John, tôi có thể nói rằng tôi nghĩ ý thức cộng đồng là điều quan trọng.
 Tôi cảm thấy nếu tôi không đăng ký nhận bản tin của bạn và không quan tâm đến chủ đề này, tôi sẽ không biết về cuộc họp tối nay.
 Tôi nghĩ có nhiều người quan tâm trong cộng đồng nhưng không biết quyết định đang được đưa ra.
 Vì vậy, tôi không biết đó có phải là nghĩa đen không.
 Khi bạn nhìn cộng đồng này từ góc nhìn của John, tôi không nghĩ có nhiều sự minh bạch trong việc ra quyết định và có rất nhiều sự quan tâm.
 Uh, bơ và các thành viên cộng đồng, tôi nghĩ ít nhất họ muốn có nhận thức, nếu không có khả năng, bạn biết đấy, phát biểu tại các cuộc họp.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3777.742s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Tôi có thể ngắt lời nhanh chóng và đặt câu hỏi cho khán giả không?
 Đối với những người trong số các bạn ở ngoài đó, có ai trong số các bạn nhận được cuộc gọi ngược 911 vì chúng tôi đã yêu cầu thành phố thực hiện một cuộc gọi như vậy hai tuần trước và nếu không, tôi biết họ sẽ đưa nó vào lịch của thành phố, nhưng tôi đã yêu cầu họ chưa?
 Cuộc gọi ngược lại chỉ để truyền tải thông điệp, bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi muốn đảm bảo rằng bạn biết bạn biết ai. Có nhiều cách khác, tôi đã đăng bài này lên mạng xã hội và thành phố đã ghi nó lên lịch, nhưng, vâng, chúng tôi biết rằng không phải ai cũng dùng Facebook, không phải ai cũng dùng mạng xã hội, vì vậy bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi muốn đảm bảo rằng chúng tôi có những người như bạn, John, bạn biết đấy, những người lắng nghe những tin nhắn họ thích và tất cả những người đã từng phản hồi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3819.423s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Tôi có một cái, nhưng ý tôi là, tôi sống ở phía bên kia của Grove và đã đăng ký nhận thông báo của thành phố.
 Vậy là mọi người đã đăng ký nhận thông báo của thành phố?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3826.977s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Vâng, tôi đã không nhận được nó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3829.032s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Chà, hãy xem lý do tại sao chúng tôi đặc biệt yêu cầu điều đó. Ý tôi là, tôi biết nó đã bị hủy vì tôi đã nhận được nó.
 Nhưng vấn đề là gì? Ý tôi là, tôi đã tổ chức một hội nghị.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3836.496s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Vì vậy, nếu tôi có thể trình bày ngắn gọn vấn đề này, nếu bạn đã đăng ký nhận thông báo của thành phố nhưng bạn chưa làm, và bạn đang ở trong khu vực đó mà không nhận được tin nhắn, địa chỉ của bạn có thể không có trong hệ thống.
 Đây là những gì chúng tôi nghĩ là vấn đề.
 Để làm điều này, bạn có thể truy cập các cảnh báo trên trang web của thành phố.
 Bạn có thể cá nhân hóa nó, trên điện thoại của mình, bạn có thể nhận nó qua email nếu đó là tin nhắn văn bản, bạn có thể nhận nó trên điện thoại cố định ở dạng giấy thay vì giấy.
 Nhưng nếu bạn không có địa chỉ ở đó, bạn sẽ không nhận được tin nhắn được bản địa hóa như vậy.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ muốn mọi người nhận thức được điều đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3876.048s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Vâng, tôi biết điều đó thật khó khăn, tôi biết không ai có thể kiếm được việc làm nữa, nhưng ý tôi là, chắc chắn sẽ có cách, cho dù đó là phương tiện truyền thống hay mạng xã hội.
 Tôi chỉ biết thật khó để tập trung vào những cuộc họp này và có rất nhiều người quan tâm đến công viên này, trong cộng đồng này.
 Tôi nghĩ họ sẽ đánh giá cao nhận thức hơn.
 Vì vậy, nếu bạn có thể nỗ lực nhiều hơn theo một con đường khác, ít nhất
 Truyền bá.
 Tôi nghĩ điều này sẽ hữu ích.
 Tôi muốn nhắc lại ý kiến ​​của một người khác đã bình luận về việc đóng lối vào Đường Newton.
 Rõ ràng, với tư cách là một người qua đường Newton, tôi thực sự nhớ nó.
 Điều này khiến cho phần cuối của công viên gần như trở thành ngõ cụt.
 Phía nam không chỉ để tiếp cận mà còn để giải trí.
 Rất ít người đi đến giữa công viên rồi quay lại khu vực này, nơi thực sự đã được đưa vào cho tất cả mọi người ở phía nam trước khi họ đóng cửa công viên.
 Tôi nghe thấy sự thất vọng của John và tôi nghe thấy sự thất vọng của người thuê nhà.
 Mọi người đều thất vọng.
 Bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi muốn anh ấy trở lại.
 Chúng tôi muốn quay lại để mở toàn bộ chiều dài của công viên.
 Vì vậy tôi biết đó là một thông điệp rất nhất quán cho hầu hết mọi người quanh đây
 Ngoài ra, có lẽ John có quyền hỗ trợ.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy, chỉ cần nhập một mục và mọi người sẽ hiểu được.
 Sau đó, tôi, tôi, nhận xét của tôi, điều mà tôi nghĩ là độc nhất và chưa bao giờ được nói ra cho đến bây giờ.
 Một lần nữa, tôi nghĩ kế hoạch này rất tuyệt vời.
 Tôi nghĩ những gì bạn đã làm là tuyệt vời.
 Mối quan tâm của tôi luôn là về việc bảo trì và trạng thái trong tương lai.
 Có một công viên đẹp và những bức ảnh đẹp là một chuyện, nhưng như chúng ta đã thấy, nếu bạn không có đủ ngân sách hoặc không nghĩ đến việc giữ nó,
 Nó có thể trở nên thực sự tồi tệ trong một thời gian rất ngắn.
 Vì vậy, khi bạn đang lập kế hoạch, hãy nghĩ về nó và có một mục trong ngân sách của bạn hoặc trong đầu về cách giữ cho nó trông đẹp nhất có thể vào ngày thực hiện.
 Cảm ơn bạn.
 Cảm ơn, Diana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4024.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Tôi chỉ muốn tiếp tục ghi chú đó.
 Tôi nghĩ đây là một ý tưởng hay mà cả thành phố nên có.
 Tôi sẽ coi cảnh quan này giống như một tòa nhà lịch sử.
 Chỉ cần nói rằng, bạn càng bảo trì và bảo quản nhiều thì bạn càng cần ít bảo trì và cập nhật hơn.
 Vì vậy, vâng, chúng tôi đang đạt được tiến bộ trong việc dọn dẹp công viên này và chúng tôi muốn nó luôn sạch sẽ, được bảo trì tốt và sử dụng tốt để nhận được ngân sách xứng đáng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4055.632s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Chà, người bình luận tiếp theo là C. Mariano.
 Nếu bạn muốn cho chúng tôi biết tên và địa chỉ của bạn để đăng ký.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4062.178s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Thực ra đó là chồng cô, Terrodon Collins, ở số 91 đường Ravine.
 Có rất nhiều điều đang diễn ra.
 Tôi yêu kế hoạch tổng thể.
 Có vẻ tốt.
 Ở đó có rất nhiều hoa huệ đen.
 Nó giống như làm một dự án ở nhà, phải không?
 Lá cờ khảo cổ vẫn còn đó.
 Vì vậy, đây là rác rưởi.
 Bạn đi theo những con đường này.
 Tôi dành ít nhất 30 phút trong khu rừng này mỗi ngày.
 Tôi và con trai đi ra ngoài và phải dọn hết những mảnh kính vỡ do những người xây tường chắn đường ném xuống.
 Chúng tôi thậm chí còn chưa thân thiết.
 Nếu bạn đi ra ngoài và cố gắng xây vỉa hè ở phía Bosque, phía đó không đủ rộng.
 Bây giờ con đường của bạn không đủ rộng.
 Vì vậy, bức tường nên được đẩy lùi về thời điểm này để giảm bớt vấn đề cho John.
 Tôi đồng ý, nên có lối vào phía Nam, 100%.
 Những cây còn lại buộc cả cộng đồng phải vào rừng để xử lý rác thải.
 Nó biến thành một đống rác hết lần này đến lần khác.
 Tôi đồng ý về các loài xâm lấn.
 Chúng tôi luôn ra ngoài và ném mù tạt tỏi.
 Tôi làm điều này mỗi khi tôi dắt chó đi dạo.
 Tôi đang uống mù tạt tỏi và ngửi thấy nó, bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi đã thực hiện những thay đổi ở một số lĩnh vực, nhưng
 Toàn bộ khu vực này đã từng rất đẹp.
 Vì đường bẩn và sâu nên bây giờ có những đống bùn.
 Có giun.
 Tôi không thể vượt qua số lượng kính làm vỡ các bức tường.
 Điều này thật nực cười.
 Còn nhiều việc phải làm.
 Nhưng điều khiến mọi người lo lắng là đây không phải là công viên.
 Đây là một công viên địa phương.
 Nó sẽ không phải là điểm thu hút mọi người đến thăm chúng tôi.
 Tôi sống trước một bức tường.
 Có lẽ bốn lần một năm, tôi thấy có người dừng lại trên phố Grove và đi bộ qua để đọc biển báo.
 Bạn biết ý tôi là gì không?
 Vì vậy, tôi thực sự đánh giá cao ý tưởng cải tiến, nhưng tôi nghĩ bạn chỉ cần tự đánh giá để biết liệu có hòa hay không.
 tới công chúng.
 Bạn biết ý tôi là gì không?
 Vì vậy, điều quan trọng nhất chính là ý kiến ​​​​của những người xung quanh, cả trực tiếp và những người đi đường xung quanh bạn.
 Ý tôi là, nếu ở đó có một khu vườn chiến thắng và... một khu vườn chiến thắng là không thể.
 Chà, điều đó thật tốt vì chúng tôi đã có một cuộc trò chuyện nội bộ vì chúng tôi đang gặp vấn đề về chuột trong toàn bộ khu vực.
 Vậy là mọi thứ đều ổn.
 Vì vậy, nó giống nhau, nhưng bạn biết đấy, các cánh đồng hầu như không bị cắt, có thể hai lần một năm.
 Ngay cả từ bạn, vẫn còn rất nhiều sỏi.
 Vì vậy, một ngày nọ, tôi gỡ phần đế của một hình nón ra khỏi công viên và đặt nó bên đường với hy vọng cuối cùng sẽ có ai đó từ thị trấn đến tìm nó.
 Bởi vì nó đã ở đó kể từ khi bức tường được xây dựng.
 Chà, tôi thấy rằng có lần trong một giải pháp, hãy nhấp vào C và ai đó phàn nàn về việc mọi người vứt rác vào đó.
 Tuy nhiên, tôi nghĩ nó đã trở thành một cuộc tranh cãi với bất kỳ ai đến gặp anh ấy
 Ý tôi là, nếu bạn không làm như vậy, nếu bạn bắt đầu một dự án và coi nó như chuyện tào lao, mọi người sẽ quay đầu lại và nghĩ, ồ, nó vẫn là chuyện tào lao.
 Tôi có thể làm những gì tôi muốn với nó.
 Vì vậy, giai đoạn đầu của dự án dường như đã được khởi động nhưng vẫn chưa hoàn thành.
 Bạn biết đấy, có những lá cờ xung quanh những người bảo vệ và thật kinh tởm khi họ ở đó.
 Tôi đã từng tử tế với bạn trước khi những bức tường bắt đầu nói cho bạn sự thật.
 Tôi hy vọng những kế hoạch bạn thực hiện sẽ thành hiện thực và biến mất.
 Tôi rất vui, bạn biết đấy, tôi ước gì nó vẫn còn trên lối đi lát ván, trên cây cầu trong công viên, vì một lần nữa mọi người lại phải đi bộ trên đỉnh.
 Trẻ em phải đi bộ trong và xung quanh Phố Grove.
 Tôi đang nói với anh Mike, hàng rào đã đổ rồi.
 Bạn biết đấy, con trai tôi đi bộ băng qua đường ray vì nó gần như an toàn hơn việc đi lên góc Grove đến trung tâm giải trí.
 Bạn biết đấy, đây là những mối quan tâm của tôi.
 Có rất nhiều trong số họ.
 Tôi nên lập một danh sách, nhưng có thể mất 30 phút.
 Nhưng chắc chắn, nó sẽ có sự tham gia của nhiều người dân địa phương hơn, bạn biết đấy, bởi vì nếu bạn không sống ở đây, bạn sẽ không đến công viên này.
 Bạn biết đấy, đây không phải là bãi đậu xe.
 Đây không phải là dấu hôn.
 Không có chuyện đó đâu.
 Vào thời điểm đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4334.142s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều và nếu bạn có thêm ý tưởng xin vui lòng gửi email cho chúng tôi.
 Bạn biết đấy, đó là một cuộc trò chuyện đang diễn ra.
 Tôi vẫn còn một chút nữa.
 Đợi đã John.
 John, tôi cần cái này và tôi có những người khác giơ tay nên tôi muốn bình luận.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4351.289s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Rất nhanh.
 Diane đang nói về việc con trai cô đi trên vỉa hè và dẫn đường cho mọi người tới đó.
 Mọi người sẽ cảm thấy thế nào nếu họ sống ở đó?
 Họ có con cái, có người đi bộ trên vỉa hè.
 Sự riêng tư của tôi ở đó.
 Tại sao không đóng bức tường lại và để lại khoảng trống giữa đường?
 Tôi không hiểu tại sao họ không làm vậy.
 Hãy đóng bức tường đó vào ngày mai và mở nó ở phố Grove.
 Vỉa hè đó, như tôi đã đúng, vỉa hè đó không đủ rộng để tạo thành vỉa hè đó.
 Các bức tường được xây dựng tồi tàn và bên trong thì bừa bộn.
 Và nó còn ồn ào hơn trước vì đó là nơi sinh ra toàn bộ rác thải.
 Họ cần phải quay lại giai đoạn đầu tiên.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4392.777s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn, John.
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4397.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Trước khi mọi người nhảy vào, hãy để tôi cung cấp một số giải thích rõ ràng có thể hữu ích.
 Vì vậy, có một số điều khác nhau đang diễn ra trong cuộc thảo luận về cái kết này.
 Chúng tôi không thể đặt đường dành cho người đi bộ ở đó vì đã có đường dành cho người đi bộ.
 Chúng tôi không muốn bất cứ ai bước qua cửa.
 Nhưng bên cạnh đó,
 Như tôi đã đề cập trước đây, chúng tôi muốn tập trung giao thông tại ngã tư chính của Đường Jackson nên cần có vỉa hè.
 Toàn bộ bức tường dài năm feet.
 Thực tế có những nơi còn hơn thế nữa, nhưng chỉ có năm feet.
 Vỉa hè ADA phải cách tường đến lề đường 48 inch và có khoảng trống 36 inch.
 Chúng tôi có điều đó.
 Một vài ngày trước chúng tôi đã
 Công viên.
 Về chi phí, chúng ta sẽ xem xét chi phí mở lại bức tường hoặc mở rộng vỉa hè.
 Vỉa hè trên đường Jackson rẻ hơn, khoảng 10.000 USD.
 Nó sẽ có giá như thế
 36.000 USD để đưa nhà thầu trở lại, di chuyển nhà, mở tường, dỡ bỏ lối đi, rút lại tường và mở các lỗ hở.
 Nó có giá khoảng 20.000 USD hoặc ít hơn, tùy thuộc vào mức độ liên quan của nó với dự án lớn hơn, vị trí vỉa hè, vị trí cắt lề đường, vị trí lối qua đường và biển báo.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi chỉ đang cố gắng cân nhắc những ưu và nhược điểm của cả hai.
 Công khai và đảm bảo rằng chúng tôi chịu trách nhiệm về mặt tài chính đối với số tiền thuế mà chúng tôi nhận được.
 Nhưng một lần nữa, đây là tất cả để tranh luận.
 Thưa ngài, đây là một ý kiến.
 Khi đó giao thông có thể bất ngờ nói: Không, đừng làm vậy.
 Hãy quay lại ý tưởng xây một bức tường, chúng ta hãy thực hiện thôi.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi cũng phải cung cấp thiết bị ADA để đảm bảo người dân có thể tiếp cận công viên vì chúng tôi nhận được phản hồi rằng mọi người muốn sử dụng công viên và chúng tôi có nghĩa vụ phải làm điều đó.
 Là một phần của công việc sơ bộ, chúng tôi muốn nói rằng nếu chúng tôi mở và đóng các lối vào thì tất cả chúng đều có thể tiếp cận được.
 Bạn biết đấy, mọi người đều có quyền vào công viên, ngay cả khi những người ở những khu vực khác trong cộng đồng không sử dụng nó, thì nó vẫn có thể sử dụng được.
 được rồi
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ sự đồng thuận chung là ngay cả khi công chúng không đến xem thì họ vẫn có thể xem nếu họ muốn.
 Bạn chắc chắn không thể để bất cứ ai hoặc bất cứ ai làm điều đó.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy, tôi.
 Tất nhiên, bạn muốn điều này có hiệu quả với bạn với tư cách là một người hàng xóm, nhưng chúng tôi cũng cần đảm bảo rằng chúng tôi đang làm mọi thứ có thể để biến điều này có hiệu quả cho toàn thành phố.
 Bạn biết đấy, M-Belt và gia đình hoàng gia có những điểm hấp dẫn nhỏ của riêng họ, nhưng đây thực sự là công viên duy nhất trong thành phố tôn vinh lịch sử.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4565.828s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Benjamin O'Cardy, bạn có thể để lại ý kiến ​​của mình.
 Nếu chúng tôi có thể xin được tên và địa chỉ của bạn để đăng ký.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4572.062s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Xin chào mọi người, tôi là Olga, Katie và tôi là vợ của Benjamin.
 Tôi có một số ý kiến ​​muốn chia sẻ.
 Chúng tôi đang ở số 38 đường Jackson.
 Vì vậy, cảm ơn vì bài phát biểu của bạn.
 Rõ ràng bạn đã cân nhắc rất nhiều ý kiến ​​đóng góp của cộng đồng khi thiết kế bài thuyết trình của mình và đưa ra cách diễn giải thay thế cho giai đoạn hai.
 Vì vậy, tôi cảm ơn các bạn đã lắng nghe cộng đồng một cách cẩn thận, đặc biệt là những người trong chúng ta sử dụng công viên hàng ngày
 Rất tích cực trong việc bảo vệ nó và giúp đỡ các thành viên của cộng đồng này.
 Ý kiến ​​của tôi đặc biệt liên quan đến việc lập kế hoạch và bảo trì cây xanh trong công viên cũng như các rào cản cách âm.
 Vì vậy, vợ chồng tôi nhận thấy trong ba năm qua chúng tôi sống ở đây rằng rào cản âm thanh đã bị phá bỏ hoàn toàn kể từ khi giai đoạn đầu hoàn thành.
 Tiếng ồn của tàu hỏa là
 Điều này thật buồn cười, ngôi nhà của chúng tôi đang rung chuyển.
 Cứ như thể mỗi ngày đều có vài trận động đất nhỏ do cây đổ rung chuyển trong phần đầu tiên của quá trình sửa chữa bức tường.
 Vì vậy, tôi rất lo lắng về những cây khác sẽ bị chặt sau này trong dự án vì mặc dù một số cây mới sẽ được trồng nhưng chúng tôi hy vọng thời gian sẽ không trùng khớp vì sẽ phải mất thời gian để những cây này đạt đến độ trưởng thành.
 Những cây bị chặt nay đã 20, 30 tuổi.
 Vì vậy, sẽ mất một thời gian trước khi chúng trở thành rào cản âm thanh hiệu quả.
 Đồng thời, tiếng ồn của tàu thật nực cười.
 Những rung động thật khủng khiếp khi phá vỡ rào cản âm thanh.
 Nó có thể dẫn đến các vấn đề về nền móng và các ngoại tác tiêu cực khác mà ban đầu bạn có thể không cân nhắc khi thiết kế dự án.
 Vì vậy tôi nghĩ các biện pháp khác là cần thiết.
 Các biện pháp đã được thực hiện để giảm tác động của rào cản âm thanh bằng cách chặt bỏ những cây khác và bất kỳ cây nào được trồng đều phải phát triển rất nhanh để thay thế rào cản âm thanh.
 Càng sớm càng tốt.
 Câu hỏi thứ hai của tôi liên quan đến việc bảo trì những cây này.
 Cụ thể, ai sẽ quản lý các dự án này?
 Đó có phải là Cục Lâm nghiệp Medford không?
 Anh ta sẽ là một người trồng cây cá nhân?
 Có phải họ đang dành tiền để tưới nước cho những cây mới này và đảm bảo chúng tồn tại?
 Bởi vì những cây đã được trồng ở Medford, trước hết, những cây mới trồng rất lâu vì lý do mà hôm nay chúng ta sẽ không đi sâu, và cây cũng không được chăm sóc vì không có ai tưới nước vì thiếu tiền.
 Vì vậy, bất kỳ cây mới trồng nào về cơ bản cũng cần ít nhất ba năm chăm sóc thường xuyên để đảm bảo sự sống của nó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4741.324s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: vâng vậy thì
 Bạn biết đấy, khi tôi đang cố gắng nảy ra những ý tưởng hay về rào cản âm thanh, bạn biết đấy, có lẽ sẽ hợp lý nếu tìm cách làm đẹp ranh giới bên đường sắt với nhiều bụi cây thấp hơn để khuếch tán tiếng ồn khắp công viên.
 Và bạn biết đấy, có lẽ chúng ta có thể tăng ngân sách trồng cây.
 Vì vậy, đây là điều chúng ta chắc chắn có thể thảo luận với Peter, kiến ​​trúc sư cảnh quan, người chắc chắn có thể giúp đỡ và xem xét vấn đề đó.
 Chúng ta có thể giải quyết vấn đề này.
 Chúng ta có thể thử xem điều đó.
 Như ai đó đã đề cập, hàng rào MBTA đã bị phá bỏ.
 Chúng tôi muốn đảm bảo rằng sau khi hoàn thành công việc trên cây, nó sẽ hoạt động trở lại.
 Bằng cách này, sẽ không còn bất kỳ điểm giao cắt nào không an toàn vì các đoàn tàu sẽ rời đi sau khi việc xây dựng hoàn tất.
 Bạn biết đấy, tất cả đều đang tiến về phía trước, không phải ai cũng dừng lại ở đó.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4806.644s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Vì thế tôi không muốn nói nhiều nhưng tôi và con trai tôi có thể chứng thực điều này vì ngày xưa nó hay trêu chọc tôi, nhưng.
 Chúng tôi thực sự đã cố gắng dọn dẹp Poms Walter Ravine bên đường và từ phía sau, chúng tôi thực sự nhổ cỏ và đi vào và trồng những loài hoa bản địa, giống như một khu vườn thụ phấn thực sự.
 Trước và sau tường đều có đất, không có đất, không có gì bên dưới, chỉ có đá.
 Năm nay chúng tôi thực sự đã được bạn bè tặng những loại hoa huệ khác nhau và những loại củ khác nhau và chúng tôi đang cố gắng trồng chúng ở chân tường, bạn biết đấy, ở bên cạnh, nếu bạn biết khu vực, có một cái cây, giống như một quả bóng nhỏ phía sau phía bên trái của bức tường.
 Nhưng một điều cần nhớ là phải tưới nước chắc chắn vì tôi không chắc loại nào trong số chúng sẽ giữ được.
 Hạt giống của tôi, tôi đã gieo hạt giống trị giá 60 đô la trong năm nay và hạt giống trị giá 80 đô la vào năm ngoái.
 Chúng tôi đã có một số việc phải mất một thời gian nhưng tôi ghét phải nói từ này vì có những người không thích nó, tôi không biết ai ở đó, nhưng với sự thay đổi khí hậu, đó là một mùa đông rất nóng và khô.
 Nếu bạn sống ở đây, bạn biết mặt trời đến từ đâu.
 Ánh sáng mặt trời không nhất thiết phải chiếu trực tiếp vào khu vực đó.
 Sau đó siêu siêu khô, không có bụi bẩn.
 Không có sàn.
 Trực tiếp ở hai bên của bức tường này.
 Một khi bạn đi vào hoặc vượt qua nó, bạn sẽ thấy bụi bẩn và rất nhiều cỏ dại.
 Nhưng muốn làm vật trang trí như hoa huệ hay bất kỳ loại cây nào khác thì phải có người chăm sóc, đặc biệt là trồng cây.
 Vì vậy không có nước trực tiếp ở đó.
 Tôi thực sự đã nghĩ đến việc hỏi hàng xóm xem liệu tôi có thể sử dụng ngôi nhà ở góc của họ và tưới nước cho ngôi nhà bên kia đường của họ hay không.
 Tôi nghĩ rằng nó không có ý nghĩa vào thời điểm này.
 Và cỏ dại mọc um tùm khắp nơi.
 Ý tôi là, mùa thu đến mỗi năm một lần ở thành phố này và cỏ làm hỏng mọi thứ.
 Thực ra năm ngoái tôi đã có một khu vườn đang phát triển và đã loại bỏ hết cỏ dại.
 Vì vậy, có.
 Nhưng chỉ vậy thôi.
 Tôi chỉ muốn nhấn mạnh điều này.
 Nếu bạn muốn làm điều đó, bạn có ngân sách cho những việc khác.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4942.083s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 Cũng xin cảm ơn Olga vì những nhận xét này, chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ xem xét lại kế hoạch khu vườn, cây cối và cách bảo trì.
 Tôi đã tổng hợp một danh sách ở đây để cho bạn biết rằng chúng tôi sẽ liên hệ với Peter và một số đồng nghiệp của chúng tôi để trao đổi về vấn đề này và suy nghĩ sâu hơn về nó.
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Vâng, sau khi tôi nhìn vào BNIC.
 Nếu bạn có thể cất cánh và cho chúng tôi tên và địa chỉ của bạn để đăng ký.
 Xin chào BNIC.

 Quay lại phản hồi một lần nữa, tôi nghĩ chúng ta có thể tiết kiệm được 36.000 đô la nếu họ yêu cầu trước khi đóng hàng rào Đường Newton.
 được rồi
 Vì vậy, tôi nghĩ đây là nỗi thất vọng mà nhiều người trong chúng ta phải đối mặt.
 Tôi cũng nghĩ nếu bạn hỏi cộng đồng, bạn thích cái nào hơn?
 Tôi nghĩ tất cả chúng ta đều sẽ nói rằng chúng ta thà trả trước còn hơn là tiêu tiền.
 Nói cách khác, hãy tiếp cận cộng đồng và nhận được rất nhiều phản hồi chứ không chỉ 20 người trong số các bạn đủ may mắn có được cuộc gặp đó.
 Thực hiện một cuộc thăm dò ý kiến ​​trên Google và làm điều gì đó để thực sự tạo dựng được sự đồng thuận trước khi đưa ra quyết định.
 Bạn biết đấy, chúng tôi không yêu cầu bạn cắt quyền truy cập đó.
 Bạn đã làm được điều đó.
 Bây giờ chúng tôi yêu cầu bạn trả lại nó.
 Bạn nói rằng nó sẽ tốn kém, nhưng đó không phải là điều bạn nên làm ngay từ đầu.
 Tôi nghĩ đây thực sự là nỗi thất vọng mà tất cả chúng ta đều chia sẻ.
 Vì vậy, hãy lắng nghe và tìm hiểu quan điểm của cộng đồng rộng lớn hơn trước khi đưa ra những quyết định này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5143.993s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Chúng tôi yêu cầu một lối vào trên Đường Newton để ngăn bạn vào.

 Tôi đánh giá cao điều đó.
 Tôi sẽ chuyển nó cho người tiếp theo giơ tay, đó là BNIC.
 Nếu bạn không thể giữ im lặng và chúng tôi chưa từng nghe tin tức gì từ bạn trước đây, nếu bạn có thể giới thiệu bản thân, nếu bạn có bất kỳ nhận xét nào, nếu không, tôi sẽ buông tay và chuyển sang người tiếp theo.
 Vâng, tôi không có tin tức gì từ BNIC.
 Một lần nữa, tôi sẽ trở lại vào ngày mai.

 Xin vui lòng để lại ý kiến ​​​​của bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5211.993s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Đúng.
 Chào tháng Sáu.
 Tôi, bạn biết đấy, tôi thực sự đồng ý với rất nhiều thành viên trong cộng đồng của chúng ta và tôi nghe thấy sự thất vọng của John cũng như sự thất vọng của Diane và
 Tôi nghĩ nên có một làn đường vào phía nam Phố Grove rõ ràng là không can thiệp vào quyền cá nhân và tài sản cá nhân của ai đó.
 Vì thế tôi có thể nghe thấy chúng to và rõ ràng.
 Bạn biết đấy, John, tôi biết bạn đã ở đây lâu rồi, nhưng tôi cũng đã ở đây hơn 20 năm.
 Bạn biết đấy, tôi không phải là người mới trong cộng đồng này, nó không chỉ là một công viên dành cho chó.
 Chúng tôi thấy nhiều trẻ em ra vào.
 Tôi yêu công viên này.
 Tôi biết là có, bạn biết đấy,
 Nhiều người trong chúng ta ngại thay đổi phải không?
 Khi già đi, chúng ta đạt đến một giai đoạn trong cuộc đời mà chúng ta không muốn thấy quá nhiều thay đổi.
 Nhưng đối với tôi, tôi thấy chúng ta đang ngồi trong một cộng đồng nơi chúng ta có thể thực sự tham gia vào những sự việc lịch sử.
 Tôi cũng không muốn khiến các khu vực lân cận của chúng ta tràn ngập xe buýt và đám học sinh, hoặc làm ngập lụt các không gian công cộng với số lượng lớn.
 Nhưng đồng thời, ở đây có một câu chuyện mà tôi nghĩ chúng ta nên đánh giá cao.
 Vì vậy, suy nghĩ của tôi là, bạn biết đấy, hãy làm điều này một cách chu đáo, chu đáo, hướng đến cộng đồng mà tôi nghĩ mọi người đang làm, thay vì cố gắng mang lại nhiều lưu lượng truy cập không cần thiết.
 Nhưng đồng thời, đây là lĩnh vực có thể hữu ích cho:
 Bạn biết đấy, những đứa trẻ ở Trường Brooks thích đi bộ xuống phố vào một ngày mùa xuân và tham gia một chuyến đi thực địa để tìm hiểu thêm một chút về lịch sử của khu vực và tôi nghĩ điều đó rất quan trọng đối với chúng.
 Tôi cũng như nhiều người khác, có lẽ trong hội nghị này, không muốn lịch sử bị lãng quên.
 Tôi hy vọng câu chuyện này được đánh giá cao và tôi nghĩ có điều gì đó rất thú vị về việc chế tạo và sử dụng con tàu này.
 Các kênh và những thứ tương tự có thể có giá trị thực.
 Đó là tất cả những gì tôi phải nói, nhưng tôi đánh giá cao sự quan tâm và cân nhắc dành cho tất cả những điều này.
 Nhưng tôi không quan tâm lắm đến sự thay đổi, miễn là nó phản ánh sự hiểu biết của cộng đồng và mọi người rằng có những phần thực sự của câu chuyện ở đây có thể được kể và khám phá một cách an toàn và khiêm tốn.
 Tôi đánh giá cao tất cả những người làm những gì họ làm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5346.996s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn bạn, Tamara.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5388.638s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Trân trọng Bill Stevens, Đường Wellgate.
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 Kế tiếp.
 Giống như mọi người khác, tôi đã sống ở đây khoảng 30 năm.
 Tôi hơi lo ngại vì tôi nghĩ bạn đang tiến hành toàn bộ dự án này mà không nói chuyện với hàng xóm hoặc cư dân của cộng đồng này.
 Tôi cũng thích không gian xanh.
 Tôi yêu những hồ nước bí ẩn.
 Tôi yêu công viên nhỏ mà chúng tôi có ở đó.
 Tôi không thích sự thay đổi này nhưng tôi thấy họ đang cố gắng làm cho công viên trở nên dễ tiếp cận hơn với xe lăn và người khuyết tật nhưng tôi nghĩ
 Không ai thực sự nghĩ về nơi đỗ xe tải ADA hoặc loại ô tô nào sẽ đỗ trên đường lái xe dự kiến ​​của bạn.
 Tôi đã xem sơ đồ mặt bằng và cho đến nay tôi thấy có hai chỗ đậu xe ở bên đường.
 Có ai có thể giải thích cho tôi cách đỗ xe tải ADA trên đường phụ và cho phép xe lăn đi được không?
 Trước dự án này, có ai từng nghĩ về những tiến bộ mà vỉa hè ADA đã đạt được chưa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5452.147s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Vì vậy, bước tiếp theo của chúng tôi là sử dụng thiết kế sơ đồ hiện có và làm việc với các kỹ sư từ sở giao thông vận tải, DPW và phòng kế hoạch để thực sự tìm hiểu chi tiết về vấn đề này.
 Bạn biết đấy, nó hoạt động hay không hoạt động như thế nào?
 Đỗ xe tải hoặc xe ADA của bạn trên đường phố hoặc trên bãi đất, bạn biết đấy, ở đâu đó, phải không?
 Vậy những chi tiết này... bạn đã đưa cảnh sát đến trước mặt người chồng.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5489.141s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Chúng ta đã có tất cả những cuộc trò chuyện này, tất cả những luật phân vùng cũng như những thay đổi nội bộ này và bạn vẫn chưa hiểu được mức độ tiếp cận của người khuyết tật ở công viên này.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi thay đổi toàn bộ câu chuyện bằng cách không cho phép ô tô đỗ trong công viên.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5507.249s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Chà, cộng đồng đã yêu cầu chúng tôi không cho phép ô tô vào công viên, nhưng tất nhiên... bạn không thể đỗ xe ở bên đường.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5512.773s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Chúng tôi cần rộng 96 inch.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5514.875s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Chính xác.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5515.315s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Vì vậy, có một điều chắc chắn là... bạn không thể đặt đoạn đường nối bên hông xe bán tải trên vỉa hè.
 Đây là lối đi dành cho cư dân.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5525.148s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Chà, tôi không chắc lắm vì chúng tôi phải nhờ một kỹ sư xem xét nó, nhưng đây là một phần của quy trình tiếp theo khi chúng tôi có kinh phí để thực hiện thiết kế.
 Hãy chuẩn bị ít nhất là trình bày chúng với cộng đồng để có được câu trả lời cụ thể cho những vấn đề này.
 Bạn biết đấy, nó là như thế đấy.
 Sự khởi đầu của giai đoạn này là hợp lệ, phải không?
 Tất nhiên, trọng tâm sẽ là giải quyết các vấn đề an toàn, cây cối và các vấn đề khảo cổ mà không ảnh hưởng đến bất kỳ điều gì khác.
 Bạn biết đấy, tôi sẽ không nói về chủ đề gây tranh cãi nhất, phải không?
 Vì vậy, đối với những chủ đề gây tranh cãi này, chúng tôi có.
 Bạn biết đấy, ít nhất sáu tháng trước khi chúng tôi đấu thầu hoặc xây dựng.
 Vì vậy, nhưng chúng ta muốn di chuyển nhanh chóng, phải không?
 Sau đó, khi đã có những thiết kế này, chúng tôi có thể gửi chúng cho cộng đồng để nhận phản hồi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5580.401s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Vậy... hãy kết thúc chuyện này trước đã.
 Điều gì sẽ xảy ra nếu những thiết kế này không hiệu quả?
 Chúng tôi chi từ ba năm trở lên số tiền của nhóm mình cho một dự án không thể tiến triển.
 Vậy điều gì có thể xảy ra trước khi bạn đầu tư toàn bộ thời gian và sức lực của mình để thăng tiến?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5595.956s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Vì vậy, vấn đề không phải là liệu nó có hoạt động hay không.
 Đó là vấn đề làm cho một cái gì đó hoạt động được.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5601.962s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Vậy là tôi đã sống ở đây được 30 năm.
 Tôi đã nhìn thấy cơ quan quản lý đỗ xe trên con phố này.
 tôi đã thấy
 Cảnh sát cố gắng giảm tốc độ, tăng tốc và con đường trông giống như đường cao tốc.
 Tôi đi bộ tuyến đường này 15 lần một ngày đến và đi làm, đưa con đi làm rồi đi tàu.
 Con đường này là đường cao tốc.
 Bạn đặt những biển báo này, tăng tốc độ lên, không có gì để kiểm soát tốc độ cả.
 Vâng, thực sự nghĩ rằng bạn có thể giảm tốc độ cho người ngồi xe lăn tới đó,
 Ai đó sẽ chết.
 Tôi không nghĩ các bạn nghĩ quá nhiều về điều đó.
 Tất cả đều là ngõ cụt.
 Vì vậy, trước khi chúng ta tiến xa hơn, tôi muốn suy nghĩ nghiêm túc về nó trước khi chi nhiều tiền thuế hơn cho dự án này so với mức tôi thực sự cần.
 Tôi biết đây là một khoản trợ cấp
 Tôi biết mọi chuyện diễn ra như thế nào.
 Tôi biết thành phố đang phải chịu đựng những công nhân bảo trì.
 Không có kế hoạch bảo trì cho tài sản này trong ngân sách của chúng tôi.
 Tôi đồng ý với việc người phụ nữ nói về cây cối.
 Gần đó, cây cối trước nhà nào cũng đổ.
 Nhà nào cũng có cây mục.
 Đây là một đất nước bị bỏ hoang.
 Tôi chỉ nghĩ rằng bạn đang thúc đẩy điều này, đặc biệt là điều khoản dành cho người khuyết tật trong việc này.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5683.977s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn Bill.
 Cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều vì bình luận của bạn.
 Chúng tôi chắc chắn sẽ xem xét chúng.
 Được rồi, nếu bạn muốn cất cánh, vui lòng liên hệ lại với BNIC.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5697.584s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Ờ, tôi thế nào rồi?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5699.865s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Vâng, xin hãy tiếp tục, thưa ông.
 Chúng tôi có thể lấy tên và địa chỉ của bạn để đăng ký không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5703.545s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Vâng, tôi là Bobby Nicotero đến từ số 3 đường Newton và tôi đã ở đây từ lâu.
 Khoảng một giờ sáng, ngôi nhà trên tàu rung chuyển.
 Một vài đêm, và sau đó, ý tôi là, mọi thứ mà mọi người đều tiếp xúc ở đây, tôi xin lỗi, tôi đã trải qua nó một cách trực tiếp hoặc gián tiếp, tôi phải nói rằng, khi chúng tôi chuyển đến đây vào năm '93, vợ tôi đã đưa ra một nhận xét thú vị.
 Anh ấy nói, Bob, tôi lớn lên ở Medford, học ở trường trung học Medford,
 Tôi nghĩ tôi biết tất cả về cách tiếp cận nhưng tôi thậm chí còn không biết về Phố Rose và tôi chưa bao giờ đến đây trước đây.
 Bạn không thể đúng hơn được.
 Đây là một tình huống rất cục bộ, cục bộ.
 Chúng tôi rất nhạy cảm về điều đó vì chúng tôi sống cùng nhau và tôi rất thân thiết.
 Tôi đã thấy mọi thứ mọi người đề cập.
 Thành thật mà nói, sẽ thật đáng tiếc nếu nó thay đổi vì đó là những gì công viên này và cộng đồng này mang lại cho những người sống ở đây.
 Mọi người yêu thích nó ở đây.
 Mọi người đều làm điều đó.
 Đây là một cộng đồng tuyệt vời.
 Nhưng trước hết, John không thể đúng hơn được.
 Tôi cần hai người hàng xóm kể cho tôi nghe về cuộc gặp tối nay, nên họ không cảnh báo tôi vì lý do nào đó.
 Tôi không đổ lỗi cho bất cứ ai.
 Thế thôi
 Bây giờ là năm 2024, nên tôi biết thứ này ít nhất nên đến tay Grovers, và những thứ đó thì tốt hơn.
 Nhưng một lần nữa, đây là một công viên địa phương.
 Tôi đánh giá cao câu chuyện này.
 Tôi sẽ không bao giờ biết đến Công viên Sagamore trừ khi con tôi và bạn bè của chúng lang thang trên đường và phát hiện ra rằng có người da đỏ bản địa ở vùng đó của đất nước.
 Câu chuyện rất thú vị và chúng tôi yêu thích nó.
 Nhưng có một sự quyến rũ và tình yêu trong lịch sử xung quanh nó.
 Mọi người phản ứng tốt với mọi thứ.
 Nhưng tôi phải nói rằng, Grove Street giống như một chiếc găng tay tốc độ.
 Chiếc xe dường như tăng tốc hoặc phanh gấp.
 Thật không may, một con chó gần đây đã bị ô tô tông chết ở Grove.
 Điều này rất rất buồn.
 Sau đó anh trở về nhà.
 Và bạn biết đấy, tôi luôn lo lắng rằng các con tôi sẽ đi dạo trong rừng và những con chó của tôi sẽ chạy trong rừng vì chúng sợ ô tô chạy qua.
 Khi xe tải đang đỗ với tốc độ cao, bạn sẽ nghe thấy tiếng va chạm và âm thanh của đồ vật rơi xuống xe tải.
 Vì vậy, tất cả những điều này cộng lại, và khi đó bạn có một công viên với nhiều người đỗ xe, đi bộ và tham quan hơn.
 Bạn biết đấy, vỉa hè rất hẹp.
 không còn nghi ngờ gì nữa
 Nếu tôi băng qua vỉa hè này, trước nhà tôi ở Grove, trên con đường đất này, tôi đoán về mặt kỹ thuật nó có thể trông rộng, nhưng khi một chiếc ô tô đi qua bạn, nó không có cảm giác rộng.
 Điều này rất, rất nguy hiểm.
 Đây là mối quan tâm lớn nhất của tôi.
 Đó là một con phố sầm uất, Phố Newton và Phố Grove.
 Đây là một ngã tư rất đông đúc.
 Hoặc chiếc xe tải mới và sẵn sàng để di chuyển đồ đạc đi khắp nơi.
 Mọi người thường xuyên rẽ vào đó và các tài xế Uber cũng rẽ vào góc này.
 Tôi đồng ý đây là một tour du lịch địa phương.
 Tôi thực sự nghĩ rằng họ nên xem xét lại mục này một cách nghiêm túc.
 Bởi vì nếu họ suy nghĩ lại và tìm hiểu thêm, ý tôi là mọi người cũng sẽ bối rối trước bài viết này như tôi.
 Điều này nên được suy nghĩ kỹ.
 Cần có nhiều đóng góp hơn vì đây là chuyện địa phương.
 Tôi nói hãy tiêu tiền.
 Số tiền bỏ ra bây giờ chẳng là gì so với những gì lẽ ra có thể bỏ ra, chỉ là những đồng xu.
 Sau đó tất nhiên là có tiền.
 Hãy tiêu tiền một cách khôn ngoan.
 Lần trước tôi đã kiểm tra, nó không nhanh như vậy.
 Vì vậy, một khi bạn thiết lập nó, nó sẽ hoạt động mãi mãi.
 Đây là lịch sử.
 Đó là lý do tại sao điều quan trọng là phải làm điều đó đúng.
 Vì thế tôi cũng bị ảnh hưởng trực tiếp như mọi người.
 Tất cả chúng ta đã ở đó được một thời gian.
 Tất cả chúng tôi đều đã nỗ lực rất nhiều cho ngôi nhà của mình ở đây và chúng tôi yêu thích nó ở đây.
 Đó là lý do tại sao tôi khuyên bạn nên xem xét lại việc mở văn phòng gần nhà John.
 John làm việc rất nhiều việc quanh nhà và trông coi tài sản của mình.
 Làm điều gì đó về tiếng ồn.
 Khi bạn ở sân sau nhà mình, về cơ bản là vài năm trước, trước đại dịch COVID, tất cả những gì bạn nghe thấy là xe buýt, xe lửa,
 Có một chiếc máy bay khi bạn đang ở trong sân của bạn.
 Vì vậy, bất cứ thứ gì sử dụng cây cối và bụi rậm làm thực vật đều tuyệt vời.
 Ý tôi là, về cơ bản là vậy, nhưng tốc độ, giống như găng tay của Newton và Grove, là yếu tố quan trọng nhất đối với tôi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6000.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Cảm ơn Bobby.
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 Tôi rất vui khi nghe ý kiến ​​​​của bạn.
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 Alice, bạn là người tiếp theo.
 Vui lòng cung cấp tên và địa chỉ đăng ký.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6009.428s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Vâng, Elyse Jennings, 94 Grove Street, trước bức tường nô lệ.
 Cảm ơn bạn đã tổ chức cuộc họp này và cung cấp tất cả thông tin.
 Tôi đồng ý với rất nhiều điều đó.
 Nhiều đêm sau khi công việc hoàn tất, tôi thức dậy vì nghĩ rằng có động đất.
 Nhưng tôi chỉ muốn nêu lên một điểm vẫn chưa được đưa ra.
 Ồ, nhân tiện, tôi là người nuôi chó và có một cậu con trai nhỏ ở phố Grove.
 Nhưng tôi muốn nêu vấn đề về lối qua đường dành cho người đi bộ.
 Chà, tôi hiểu nhu cầu truy cập và nó có thể giúp làm chậm lưu lượng truy cập.
 Tôi chỉ lo lắng về những con quái vật có quá nhiều logo hoặc đèn nhấp nháy.
 Tôi không biết những đoạn này sẽ trông như thế nào.
 Tôi không biết chúng tôi thực sự cần bao nhiêu.
 Vì vậy, tôi chỉ muốn đề cập đến vấn đề này vì tôi chưa từng nghe đến nó trước đây.
 Tôi cũng muốn vang vọng thông điệp lan truyền.
 Tôi nghe một người hàng xóm biết tôi sống ở đây và kể cho tôi nghe về điều đó, tôi thật may mắn khi biết một số người hàng xóm vì tôi đã ở đây được tám năm, nhưng chúng tôi có một số hàng xóm mới chưa kết nối.
 Vì vậy, sẽ tốt hơn nếu bạn có thể dễ dàng tìm thấy thông tin về các cuộc họp này đang diễn ra và các kế hoạch này đang được thực hiện.
 Và sau đó bình luận một chút về thời điểm bức tường nô lệ và tất cả các bức tường khác được xây dựng.
 Một lần nữa, nói về những điều khó chịu, chúng tôi có một cái bô trước mặt.
 Ô tô sẽ dừng lại và mọi người sẽ sử dụng bô.
 Sau khi công việc hoàn thành, anh ấy ở đó hàng tháng, hoặc ít nhất là vài tuần sau đó.
 Tôi không biết liệu công việc tiếp theo của tôi có bao gồm một cái bô trong phòng hay không, nhưng để đề phòng
 Hãy cắm nó vào và đảm bảo nó được quản lý tốt để chúng tôi không phải ở đó lâu hơn giờ làm việc.
 Vâng, đây chỉ là những nhận xét tôi muốn đưa ra.
 cảm ơn bạn
 Cảm ơn bạn rất nhiều.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6140.425s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Trên thực tế, thông tin về cuộc họp đã được lắng nghe ở đó.
 Đăng, cảm ơn bạn, thế là tôi phát hiện ra, tôi đang dắt chó đi dạo và có người đóng đinh tấm biển ở đó, cảm ơn bạn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6162.239s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Vâng, tôi cũng biết được thông tin này từ một người hàng xóm, thực ra là ở Diane, tiếc là không phải từ thành phố.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6171.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bạn có ý kiến ​​gì khác trước khi chúng ta kết thúc tối nay không?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6176.912s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Không, nhưng tôi muốn nói rõ rằng nếu mọi người có nơi để đến để lấy thông tin, bạn nên cho chúng tôi biết khi bạn gửi email cho chúng tôi, ví dụ: nếu bạn có nơi để đến, chúng tôi sẽ cố gắng tìm hiểu xung quanh.
 Bạn biết đấy, cách đây vài năm đã có diễn đàn trò chuyện Yahoo mà mọi người đều tham gia.
 Nhưng bạn biết đấy, nếu bây giờ tình huống tương tự xảy ra, chúng tôi muốn cố gắng tăng các nguồn lực này để đảm bảo rằng chúng tôi sử dụng tất cả các nguồn lực có sẵn cho mình.
 Jen, có lẽ chúng ta có thể thử, bạn biết đấy, nếu chúng ta tiếp tục công việc thiết kế hoặc những việc tương tự, nếu chúng ta có một buổi họp khác, có thể bạn có thể đưa ra một dự luật thuế mà bạn biết đấy, nó sẽ có tác động.
 Ít nhất là ngôi nhà.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6217.961s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ừ, tôi nghĩ Dennis và tôi đã nói về hóa đơn tiền nước.
 Nó chỉ khó thôi.
 Cũng giống như bạn phải nhận được email của mình đúng cách.
 Thật không may, chúng tôi thực sự không có đủ ngân sách và phải làm việc với thành phố để cố gắng hoàn thành công việc này.
 Vì vậy, chúng tôi sẽ lắng nghe bạn và xem chúng tôi có thể làm gì và cố gắng thực hiện nó.
 Hãy cố gắng giữ nó, bạn biết đấy, có thể chúng ta sẽ làm gì đó với nó,
 Bạn có thể đi dạo gần đó.
 Chúng tôi sẽ có một số suy nghĩ và thực sự đánh giá cao ý kiến ​​​​của mọi người tối nay.
 Một lần nữa, nếu bạn có bất kỳ suy nghĩ nào sau cuộc họp này, vui lòng gửi email cho ủy ban.
 Đây chắc chắn không phải là kết thúc của quá trình.
 Đây là phần đầu hoặc phần giữa và chúng tôi hoan nghênh phản hồi.
 Nếu bạn muốn tham gia danh sách gửi thư của chúng tôi, vui lòng gửi cho chúng tôi danh sách gửi thư của bạn và chúng tôi sẽ đảm bảo rằng bạn có tên trong danh sách của chúng tôi bằng cách gửi email cho chúng tôi.
 Chúng tôi luôn sẵn lòng chấp nhận ý kiến ​​​​và đề xuất.
 Vì vậy, cảm ơn như mọi khi.
 Cảm ơn tất cả mọi người đã đến tối nay.
 Cảm ơn bạn đã ở đây hơn 90 phút và hẹn gặp lại lần sau.
 Cảm ơn rất nhiều.
 chúc ngủ ngon</p>
