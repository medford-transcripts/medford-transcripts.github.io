    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=149.076s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you, Jen, for that introduction, and I think Ryan's going to get the.
 Presentation up on the screen.
 Great.
 Thanks, Ryan.
 So everybody should be looking at just the title slide here.
 My name is Peter Headland, a landscape architect and a planner based in Arlington right next door.
 I was fortunate enough to work on the master plan project and have now been doing a little study on this concept design.
 And we'll talk about that shortly here.
 Okay, next slide.
 Great.
 The 2020 master plan, we started in 2019.
 It was almost a year process.
 It went through 2020.
 And that's all on the historical commission website.
 And at the end of that, we came up with a series of phased implementation projects that could happen over a period of
 20 years, and we'll talk about the first phase of that with the next slide.
 So this shows the first, say, seven of these implementation ideas that came out of the master plan, restoring the wall, the historic wall right on the edge of Grove Street.
 an archaeological dig at the estate, which has also taken place.
 We'll talk about that a little bit.
 Making improvements to the Grove Street edge, the fieldstone wall there.
 Those were in phase one and we'll go over those in a little bit.
 Other projects
 from the master planning include new crosswalks, improvements to the trails, some type of signage to identify the park, and some planting in this central planted LA.
 Okay, on the next slide, we'll talk about that.
 The first step and really the reason for this whole park is what's now known as Pomp's Wall.
 In 2019, the image on the upper left, that was the condition when we began the master plan and we had a historic masonry consultant, Richard Irons, come and maybe some of you heard him talk.
 He gave a presentation a number of years ago.
 He evaluated the wall.
 I wrote up a pretty detailed technical memo about the wall and went over some options to restore the wall.
 Some of you might know that a wall that part of the, in the deed when this part was given to the city of Medford, it stipulated that this wall, they were so proud of this wall, that this wall needed to be forever maintained.
 The preservation and restoration of this wall is really important or else technically, the old estate could take this part back over, but luckily, that's not going to happen.
 The middle slide there shows the previous joint conditions, pretty deteriorated and the capstone needed some significant repair.
 So, in the next slide, we show the process in 2023.
 Mason was hired to do that work.
 This is that restoration.
 A lot of the wall really had to be taken apart and put back together.
 And maybe some of you.
 were there or witnessed some of that progress.
 And the brick on the right side is pretty interesting.
 The contractor pulled that out and you can see a fingerprints on the top of that brick.
 So that's
 Pretty interesting, the wall was said to have been built in 1760, and so those are over 250 years old.
 Were they from Pompeii, the former enslaved person who built the wall?
 Perhaps Medford was known for local brick making and these bricks were sourced locally, but that's really sort of a neat glimpse of history and all those bricks went back into that wall.
 On the next slide, you can see the final result from last year of the newly restored wall with newly pointed bricks.
 They ended up putting a new cap on top of it to really seal that with flashing.
 Hopefully, this will last for the next few generations.
 Okay, so the next project that came out of the master plan in phase 1 was improving the Grove Street edge, the old field stone wall.
 It's an interesting historic image on the right hand side of the screen here, which shows it's looking up Grove Street.
 That is the
 historic wall, formerly known as the slave wall, now known as Pompe's wall.
 And you can see the wall as it was historically, but over time, it had sort of fallen apart in some areas more than others.
 The image on the left here is showing prior to the master plan, you know, the
 wall in this area was pretty gone, and so the thought there was to improve this fieldstone wall.
 And so the next slide shows the results of that.
 With the wall repaired, it really helps to define the edge of the park.
 Also, cutouts were left at intersections for crosswalks to access the park.
 And...
 Another part of that project was for five feet behind that wall, clearing out the understory, a lot of invasive plants have popped up in there.
 Clearing that out a little bit, let these big trees, you can see this one over on the right side, give them a little bit more room to grow.
 Ryan, at the end, we'll talk a little bit about some upcoming planting maintenance improvements.
 Okay, on the next slide, we talk about the third part of this first phase of projects coming out of the master plan, the archaeological dig at the estate.
 Here we see illustration of the Thomas Brooks house that was right behind that wall.
 This later colored here, that's that wall, that's Pomp's Wall.
 You can see the drive right behind it and what this house looked like.
 It was built in 1727.
 The house was demolished in 1860.
 Then it just really sat there because it was never redeveloped and became a park.
 The archaeologists we brought on for the master plan were determined, and they were correct, that this is a highly sensitive area for archaeological findings.
 And the master plan proposed an archaeological dig
 with a professional and to work collaboratively with community volunteers, and that happened.
 And they thought that there was the possibility to find, very good possibility to find both pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.
 And on the next slide, we see that dig, which happened in 2022 and 23.
 Maybe some people on this call, this Zoom meeting were part of that.
 You can see some of the people from the community along with the professionals working on that dig.
 There were 23 test pits and over 1,600 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 And post-contact and pre-contact mean either pre-contact is pre-colonial settlement and post-contact is after settlers arrived.
 So there was both interesting findings from both of those areas, which is pretty neat.
 And here's some of the things that were found.
 That piece of pottery was on that site.
 Okay, next slide please Ryan.
 So there is a pretty detailed survey report from the master plan that made some recommendations.
 They recommended to protect and preserve this site, specifically this estate site area.
 They thought it was a highly sensitive area in and around the house site, and that in this area, that any below ground disturbance should be avoided or ideally kept at a real minimum.
 And that will come into play when we talk about the concept for this area.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan.
 We see where that area is.
 This is the approximate house location.
 We're looking south on the dirt path.
 You can kind of see the back of Pomp's wall there.
 So that's generally where that house was.
 On the next slide, we have a couple images looking both south on that site.
 Some low vinca has grown up there.
 Maybe,
 A remnant from ground cover that was planted originally that could be possible.
 And then this is looking north.
 It was a pretty open site originally around that estate, but trees have have grown in over time.
 Okay, and the next slide.
 We see a couple other just context views of the north entrance.
 This is the newly reconstructed wall and the break in the wall at the roadway opposite.
 This is looking south on the south approach and you can see the open lawn there.
 These are the two ways that visitors would get to this area.
 Next slide.
 Okay, so we've been working for the last number of months and through a couple meetings on a design concept for this central area for this historically sensitive area, and I'll walk you through the main.
 Concepts here, and with the 3 big ideas for the design concept to improve accessibility to the park.
 And help identify the park as such as as a park and to make some of this really interesting history visible.
 I remember when I first started working on the master plan, and I.
 was out exploring the park, it's definitely not evident that it is or was a town-owned property.
 And so the improvements to the walls certainly help.
 And some simple signage will help to identify it as an important historical park for the town of Medford.
 So the first concept is a history wall.
 which is a, these paths really sort of already exist, they're dirt pathways, mostly, and creating a loop here in this thicker orange line that would help to connect
 a number of these historically sensitive areas and use historic markers to interpret the history a little bit.
 And we'll go through each of those.
 But these blue circles are those 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 markers there.
 Also, two potential areas for welcome signs to the park.
 We'll talk about the
 interpretation and stabilization measures around the former estate site.
 And you have to be able to get to the park, so new crosswalks and accessible parking.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan, we'll kind of walk through each of these.
 First is the history walk.
 The walk, again, in this thicker orange here, it would be an accessible path in terms of slope and surfacing.
 We haven't done a detailed, there hasn't been a detailed field survey done of this area of the park, but we think that it can be an accessible path below 5% slope.
 And we'd like to connect that to new crosswalks so people from this community, or maybe who are parking there could get into this park.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 There are 2 potential areas for welcome signs, and Ryan will talk a little bit more about this at the end.
 It would be great to identify the park, to name it, and to welcome visitors, to make them feel welcome.
 So here, opposite Jackson Road or potentially Ravine Road to the north are 2 potential areas for welcome signs.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 just a little bit history about Thomas Brooks Park.
 This is 1860 Brooks estate plan, which was pretty big.
 A lot of this land has since been given to the city of Medford.
 Our little sliver right there is Thomas Brooks Park.
 You can tell it's this almost like sharp triangle.
 Up on the upper right is
 at H.F.
 Walling Plan from 1855.
 And here we see our park there.
 It's easy to identify the railroad, which is this diagonal line, and then Grove Street.
 And so that sliver right there is what the future park looked like in 1855.
 It is adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.
 And then the six-acre park was conveyed to the city in 1924, again, with the stipulation that the
 brick wall, now known as Pomp's Wall, be forever maintained.
 On the next slide, we talk about these historic markers.
 Originally, in earlier iteration, this walk was just a linear path from here to here.
 But then as we took some feedback and evolved it a little bit, it's become more of a loop.
 Pomp's wall is right here just to orient everyone.
 It's great.
 And Grove Street is right here.
 So the proposal is to have a series of five simple historic markers so that visitors to the site would help to understand the rich history here a little bit better.
 Both the Native American history,
 which marker could be there, the African American history with this pretty remarkable wall, Pomp's Wall, that's just been restored.
 There's a pretty fascinating history of water systems and the Middlesex Canal here, and
 This is an appropriate place for that historic marker because it looks out over this lawn.
 We'll talk about that in a little bit.
 And then on the back of the park here, you're right next to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, now known as the MBTA Lowell Branch Railroad.
 which also has a rich history, and then coming around to the colonial American history of the site and the sort of remains of the Thomas Brooke estate and thinking about how to interpret and mark that.
 Okay, so over the next handful of slides, we move to the next one, we'll talk about how to do that and why that's important.
 So the Native American historic marker, again, with the archaic,
 I have a hard time saying that word today.
 With the dig that was just done, there were 64 pre-contact artifacts found collected during the 22-23 dig, which is pretty neat.
 Maybe some community members on this call or in this picture, I don't know.
 Largely, the items that were found were chipping debris and pottery shards.
 presumably from the middle to late Woodlands period, 2000 to 450 years ago.
 So pretty significant historical resource.
 And this has a potential for rich Native American history, given the proximity of water resources and the
 topography.
 So that's pretty invisible now, but it'd be great to make that history a little bit more visible, just with a simple interpretive marker.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we talk about Pomp's Wall.
 Okay, the existing marker, which is there, if you want to
 Sneak on the edge of the roadway and or peek at it from your car is shown on the upper right there.
 This upper left is a historic photo, which the date is unknown of, and the photo in the middle is from 1899.
 So you can look up Grove Street.
 You can see the wall, it's beginning to get overgrown there, but pretty open behind it, some of the big trees there.
 We know the wall was constructed around 1760, that the city is required to preserve and forever maintain it in that deed.
 to the city, it stipulates that.
 And then there was this recent, very important restoration and renaming of the wall.
 So that's an important history to help make visible.
 Okay, if we go to the next slide, we can help to mark in a way the importance of the Medford water systems.
 This picture on the left is a little hard to see.
 All these slides will be posted on the
 Historical Commission website.
 And if you look on there, there's a lot of information from the past number of years from all the studies and meetings that were done.
 This is a plaque elsewhere in Medford that shows the Middlesex Canal and the route.
 Our little park
 is right here.
 You can see the railroad and Grove Street.
 And so this Middlesex Canal was right to the south of this area.
 The Middlesex Canal was around from 1793 to 1853, ran from Charlestown to Lowell.
 It was partly financed by the Brooks family, which has such a prominent role.
 in the city of Medford.
 It supplied much of the lumber for shipbuilding in Medford.
 That was such a big industry in the city.
 On the lower right is an image of one of the bridges.
 There were a number of
 bridges, 50 bridges, all along the canal.
 And this was one in Medford that was taken down.
 But we think that some of these blocks were used in this Grove Street field stone wall, especially south of Pomp's Wall.
 You can go look and the stones there are more cut in.
 rectilinear blocks.
 I can't get into a lot of it here, but there's really a fascinating study that the head of the MWRA did on the role of Medford in the whole water and sewer development for the city of Boston in the nearby area.
 It's pretty fascinating.
 area where we're proposing this historic marker looking out on that field, well part of the reason the field is there and it's not overgrown is because there's a sewer easement that actually runs through there.
 And so there's a lot of interesting things to talk about for a potential historic marker talking about these water systems and the task will be how to distill this information in a concise way.
 Okay.
 If we go to the next slide, I talked a little bit about the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the proposals for historic marker on the backside of Thomas Brooks Park, talking about this, that this railroad was constructed in 1835.
 Also,
 partly financed by the Brooks family, the people didn't really want the railroad to happen, especially the people who were invested in the canal because the railroad made the canal not as necessary.
 And it essentially replaced the canal in order to speed up.
 Transportation provide year-round freight transportation because the canal would freeze in the winter.
 This railroad, it was the first major railroad in the state, one of the first in the whole Northeast, and it's still used today.
 It's an active rail line as the MBTA Lowell line.
 That's an image on the bottom right.
 You can see Boston and Lowell there.
 Okay, and Ryan, if you go to the next slide, the last historic marker kind of gets back to what we started with, with the dig on the site.
 Now, this is an image of the Brooks Estate House, and the historic marker would help to reinterpret that or interpret that history.
 that this house was built in 1727, you can see here there was a little curved driveway behind that brick wall.
 And that's essentially where, if you walk out there, where that dirt footpath is and where that history walk would be.
 Then you can see the brick wall between the street and the driveway, that's the palms wall.
 We know historically it was noted that there were three black walnut trees in front of the house.
 You can see them in this illustration and also those original trees aren't there.
 But if you're out there in that park, there are black walnut trees that are descendants, I think, of these original trees.
 Then as we know, there are a lot of artifacts recovered.
 from the dig over 1600 from the post-contact or colonial era.
 Okay, on the next slide, we looked at this site.
 This is the general area of that estate house, and the proposal is to both protect and preserve and interpret this site a little bit by marking the
 Corners of where the house was with simple stone blocks and stabilizing the surface with low plantings.
 And then this would be the blue circle that historic marker, which would be able to interpret it.
 So, if you go to the next slide.
 This was one of the site precedents that we looked at, Robbins Farm Park.
 It's a neat park right next door to Medford, up on the top of the hill.
 There's an old farm there.
 It was given to the city, turned into a park, and maybe probably 10 years or so ago,
 Park and Recreation Commission wanted to sort of memorialize the house in the former farm there.
 And so they put, they marked the foundation here with these stone blocks.
 These are kind of similar to what we're thinking for Thomas Brooks Park.
 And they had a simple sign in their case, it was right on the block.
 In our case, maybe it would be a separate standing element as a way to
 Talk about the former farmhouse that was there and give people a sense of that history a little bit.
 Okay, on the next slide we have another site that's interpreted the historic history, tracing the foundations of historic house.
 This is the Governor Winthrop House in Charleston, the great house site where they used found stones and some foundation stones and brought those to the surface and
 Trace that foundation there and then just a simple lawn is a very different setting their more urban area and more extensive historic sign that you can see on the bottom right.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 We also would like to stabilize the surface in a very simple way with ground cover planting.
 There's already a little bit of that there with a vinca that's taken over, naturalized the site a little bit.
 And on the next slide, we'd like to add to that a little bit with a nice native plant, gold star.
 It's native, shade-tolerant, a lot of trees around, pretty low, 6-12 inches tall, and has a nice bloom from the late spring into the fall.
 You can imagine walking on this path and coming across these blocks and a little burst of flowers might be a pretty elegant, beautiful, but yet subtle way to think about this site.
 On the next slide, we talked about another way that we could use plants to bring back the history.
 This is Syringa vulgaris, a common lilac, which is for hundreds of years been part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 And the quote on the bottom here is from the
 Medford paper in 1912, that some of the historic research which the state did, which predated the master plan, they pulled together, and I'll just read the quote, beside the street, Grove Street, and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 So they're talking about Palm's Wall and they're talking about Grove Street, which by the looks of this was originally bordered with lilac.
 So wouldn't it be neat, the upper right image is of the Arnold Arboretum on Lilac Sunday.
 Pro tip, that's a great place to go.
 Amazingly,
 blooms in the middle of May.
 We'd like to bring those lilacs back at the wall.
 On the next slide, we can see a picture of the wall.
 This is looking right up Grove Street and Palm's wall over on the right hand side with a field stone wall next to it.
 And on the next slide, just a little illustration of what some lilacs would look like right behind that wall.
 It would look pretty nice for vehicles or people on the sidewalk over on the other side here.
 It's a nice southern orientation there, southwest orientation.
 So I think those lilacs would do well.
 And at the same time, we could plant some, just a low ground cover on the roadside to help stabilize that embankment there.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we have a look at the existing conditions behind Pompe's wall and up that path so this would be the history walk and then the next slide shows a little illustration of
 what that might look like with some lilacs over on the side in this simple walkway that would then loop around with a series of historic markers and then the stone blocks at the estate house to give a deeper understanding of the rich history of this site.
 Okay, on the next slide, I believe we're hopping into some information Ryan from the historical commission can share on the upcoming improvements for the second phase at the park.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=1938.088s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 好吧，现在我只想快速深入了解第二阶段的构建更新。
 因此，重申一下 Jen 在开头所说的，我们有 2020 年总体规划，但该文件是一份动态文件，可能会发生变化。
 这将会发展。
 因此，无论总体规划中有什么内容，我相信你们中的一些人已经读过，我们使用的分期与施工中所需的分期不同。
 因此，对于这个资助阶段，完全得益于社区保护委员会的慷慨资助，我们打算进行更大规模的考古挖掘，我们打算根据《美国残疾人法案》的要求修剪一些树木并清除枯木，
 通往路边切口、人行道和停车位的建筑通道。
 我们试图通过标记和张贴一些标志来识别十字路口，然后，当然，我们试图将这个地方识别为公园。
 有几件事正在考虑中。
 当然，我们正在关注彼得刚才谈到的这个考古前沿，它正处于早期规划阶段。
 当然，我们正在考虑诸如改善步道清晰度、添加适合场地的树木以及在植树时进行一些灌木修剪和侵入式割草等措施。
 但当然，没有考虑到什么，我们很久以前在公众会议上就听说过，现在我们听到，即使在总体规划中，我们也没有以任何方式考虑社区花园或铁路桥。
 所以我要把这个放在一边，这样人们就知道我们正在考虑的是对公园影响较小的事情，好吗？
 因此，对于考古学，我们打算聘请一位考古学家来探索托马斯·布鲁克斯故居的遗址以及居住在那里的人们，包括布鲁克斯家族及其雇用的员工。
 这是一个鲜为人知的话题，但已被探索过。
 该遗址与新英格兰的奴隶制有很多联系，因此它是一个非常重要的地方。
 所以，在做出任何限制之前
 为了永久保护该遗址，我们希望完成对此事的考古尽职调查。
 我们将寻找社区志愿者，就像上次一样，我们可以让人帮助我们筛选土壤和对文物进行实验室工作，以便人们可以看到它们。
 所以我们一定会为此努力。
 我们考古部分的工作将是我们希望在两者之间设置的限制
 你知道，佩德罗的历史之旅以及对房子和解释面板的解释以及所有这些都是为了保护这个网站免受任何负面影响。
 有很多树木修剪工作要做。
 为此，我们正在研究与该地点 50 棵树龄约 150 年的树木相关的最直接问题。
 其中，保存状况较好的古树有30株。
 他们需要修剪，就像修剪灯一样，只是为了去除一些枯枝，一些领导者折断了，但有10
 公园内和周围的树木完全死了。
 您可以在右侧看到这张图片，其中他们的领导人完全分裂，什么都没有留下，为了公共安全，这些树必须被移除。
 在其他图像中，例如最左边的图像，您可以看到领导者已经分开并摇摇欲坠地悬挂在一些小路上。
 所以我们正在寻找
 将它们全部修剪，使婴儿围栏从一端到另一端都牢固。
 还有两棵入侵的挪威枫树已经完全死亡。
 它们高耸于这个地方。
 他们身高约20英尺，但只有15岁。
 我们希望将其移除，因为任何大小如此之大的树都会造成滋扰，并且会绕过 MBT​​A 的通行权。
 但随着树木的修剪，
 我们希望种植 15 棵新树。
 我说的是橡树，但与城市树木管理员交谈时，它可能是橡树，也可能是糖枫树，这些树原产于新英格兰，也原产于这个地方，我们希望取代这里的入侵性挪威枫树，我们有计划继续种植可以治愈的树木，可以这么说，以便公园成为一个公园并保持森林的感觉。
 现在，作为该项目的一部分，最重要的关键部分之一是我们希望清除整个场地中的所有死木。
 所以我们知道，当格罗夫街发生冰暴时，一些枯木被从街上移走。
 DPW 破坏了这一点。
 让我们完成这项工作吧。
 当然，出于公共安全原因，在隔离墙期间也砍伐了几棵树。
 所有这些都将被消除。
 然后，所有即将死亡或死去的历史树木的各种树便将从公园的一端移至另一端。
 所以这将是一次从上到下的彻底清洁。
 大部分此类材料如果太大，将会从网站上删除。
 如果再小一点的话
 它可以被压碎，我们会将其中一些放回到道路上，这样道路上就有了一些定义。
 为了改善无障碍环境，我们在整个公园内分布了多个设施。
 最重要的是，我们将重新连接格罗夫街东侧的人行道（目前终止于牛顿街）至杰克逊路的新入口。
 我们将在所有墙壁开口处切割人行道。
 Jackson Road、Gravine Road和Layard Road将设有条纹人行道。
 人行横道处将设有指示牌。
 当然，所有这一切都需要很长时间，因为有很多重要的参与者。
 所以我们正在探索和研究设计和概念，但是当我们开始推进这个项目时，城市的公共工程部门、交通部门都必须介入。
 所以我们才刚刚开始，还有很多很多个月的时间。
 但我们希望也许能在 2025 年春季开始施工，这样我们就可以基本上以正确的方式开始新的一年，并在冬季后的第一个可能的施工期间，我们将开始并交付我们已经工作了一年多的这些东西。
 为了获得空间，它们需要在附近的某个地方标记为无障碍路线和公园周围无障碍路径的一部分，即一个停车位。
 当我们最初制定总体规划时，我们被要求禁止汽车进入公园。
 因此，我们必须在某处提供 ADA 无障碍空间。
 我们将与居民以及你们所有人合作，尝试将其安置在一个对无障碍路线和居民都方便的位置。
 但它还要求该市与交通部门举行公开听证会。
 因此，将会有很多很多的机会来解决这个空间适合什么地方以及如何适合的问题。
 当然，
 想法改变了。
 有访问权。
 这并不可取，但如有必要，我们可以将停车位移回原位。
 对于人行道标记，我们希望保持简单。
 你知道，一条简单的油漆人行道就可以了。
 标牌尽量减少。
 前几天我们和交通部门谈过。
 也许人们更喜欢明亮的标志（如果有的话），那就是杰克逊路。
 那里有大量人群集中穿过公园的正门，这甚至可能是居民上下学的安全路线。
 但根据我们听到的反馈，这有待讨论。
 然后是公园标牌。有两种不同类型的公园标牌。
 有欢迎您参加历史之旅的标牌和解说标牌。
 但实际上，在这个阶段，我们试图将公园识别为公园。
 我们希望在同一条街上有类似布鲁克斯庄园标志的东西。
 该网站与
 归布鲁克斯庄园所有，但可能有自己的身份。
 所以我们还没有真正的设计，但我们确实有一些东西可以将其标识为具有一定历史的城市公园，以便每个人都知道它不仅仅是一片废弃的森林，它实际上是梅德福的一个重要场所。
 当然，通过持续的规划，我们正在考虑将一些事情作为该项目的一部分，这些事情将导致其他项目。
 我们有关于树木的历史工作。
 有一次，我们想打开一条种满橡树和黑胡桃木的小巷。
 或许可以减少一些入侵的挪威枫树。
 但我们正在倾听，我们了解到目前植被的作用就像一种声幕。
 因此，作为其中的一部分，我们会讨论种植一些树木，以便随着现有景观的缩小，更大、更合适的树木可以增加尺寸。
 并且这个声音缓冲区始终被维护。
 但同样，这是后期阶段，有很多很多很多淘汰。
 但最大的问题是，正在进行的一些树木修复工作将减轻对 MBTA 围栏的损坏。
 因此，我们将让 MBTA 与我们合作修复围栏，确保公园安全，最终确保没有人能够跨越铁道床。
 这就是我们第二阶段工作的核心。
 所以我们知道您有意见和问题。
 因此，我认为如果您想发表评论或对我们有任何疑问，我们很乐意回答。
 我们只是要求人们举手。
 当然，今晚没有必要发表所有评论。
 这并不是一切的结束。
 我们将尽力继续考古实地工作，这不是
 除了出于安全原因进行挖掘、封顶和一些树木工作之外，对公园有任何影响，但其余工作将在六个月内再次完成该项目，因此，如果您知道稍后会出现问题，并且如果您想花一些时间消化今晚听到的内容并将其放入其中，我们将接受评论并很高兴收到电子邮件
 当然，正如我在会议开始时所说，如果我们没有您的电子邮件，如果您不在我们的联系人列表中，请向我们发送电子邮件，我们将很乐意将您添加到我们的电子邮件和广告中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2629.627s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi, Ryan.
 Mèsi, Pedro.
 Jan Ryan te di, mwen kontan louvri espas pou kòmantè oswa kesyon nan moman sa a.
 Si yon moun gen yon bagay, si yo vle leve men yo, m'ap rele.
 Tamara, si ou vle refè.
 Nick, èske nou ka konnen adrès ou anrejistre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2651.095s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi.
 14 Newton Road, West Medford, nan sid Thomas Brook Park.
 An brèf, mwen jis vle remèsye tout moun paske yo te peye atansyon, koute kominote a, ak remèsye yo pou efò yo ak travay di nan prezève istwa a ak inik nan zòn sa a.
 Mwen jis vle di ou mèsi.
 Li evidan, prezantasyon ou bezwen anpil travay.
 Ou byen klè koute kominote a e mwen renmen sa w ap fè e mwen vrèman apresye li.
 Mèsi anpil pou travay di ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2683.696s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi anpil.
 Dave, si ou vle refè, mwen ka wè men ou.
 Èske nou ka jwenn non ou ak adrès ou pou anrejistreman?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2691.141s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Se konsa, kesyon mwen an se: yo te pran yon bagay an konsiderasyon?
 Sa k ap pase a te pase lontan anvan nou te rete isit la, moun ki ale nan pak la jis koupe la ak bò miray nou an poko fini.
 Pou moun nan nou ki ap viv isit la, sa a se yon ti jan anmèdan.
 Anpil moun tou senpleman koupe gazon, koupe gazon, koupe twotwa.
 Pwen mwen se ke si pòsyon sa a nan miray la pa fini, moun ki sou bò lari nou an jiska High Street, tout moun nan zòn sa a, yo pral kontinye pase nan pwopriyete nou an ak Brooks Estate nan fason sa a.
 Mwens moun pral reyalize tout objektif ou yo ak objektif diferan
 Oke, ou konnen, kote a, koulwa yo ak tout sa.
 Kidonk, mwen pa konnen si gen moun ki te pale pou fini pòsyon miray sa a sou bò kote nou an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2766.663s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Se konsa, mwen ka fè kòmantè ak Ryan ta ka vle chime nan tou.
 Nou tande anpil kòmantè sou bò miray la.
 Se poutèt sa sit la fèmen pou egzakteman rezon ou te deklare yo, paske moun ap travèse pwopriyete prive pou jwenn aksè nan pak la.
 Akòz sa a ak liy vizyon yo nan pèspektiv trafik la, ouvèti a ogmante pou travèse wout la pi fasil.
 Koulye a, nou konnen ke gen fè zigzag soti nan yon bò nan lòt la se pa ideyal.
 Se poutèt sa nan pwochen faz la nou pral elaji twotwa ki sou menm bò lari a rive nan ouvèti ki egziste a pou moun pa oblije travèse yon bò a lòt.
 Dave, yo menm tou yo pa oblije travèse antre kay ou epi antre nan pwopriyete w la pou ale nan zòn pak zèb la.
 Alor nap travay lo sa, nou konpran e ekout bann fristrasyon bann dimoun lo bout anba Grove Street e dan sa bann ale, e nou pe sey fer li pli fasil pour bann dimoun lo sa lari pour pa bezwen travèse lari de fwa.
 Ryan, santi w lib pou antre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2841.618s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Wi, nou jis, ou konnen, nou definitivman vle bati twotwa sa a.
 Nou fè entansyonèlman kite miray la senk pye soti jis pou asire w te gen plas pou pasaj la.
 Ou konnen, pral gen yon pye bwa sou bò kote miray la koube, kidonk li disparèt.
 Mwen panse ke gen yon siy vitès monte ki bezwen ajiste.
 Men, Lè sa a, gen yon ti mache bèl ak akeyan nan antre prensipal la.
 Li evidan si ta gen kèk siy sou pasaj pou piaton an, si nou mete kèk siy limyè, pou di konsa, pou moun te konnen ke nan mitan lannwit oswa lè te gen ti limyè, sa a se yon pasaj pou piaton, li ta pi evidan pou ale nan antre prensipal la nan pak la ak pak la.
 Ou konnen, kounye a,
 Li se yon chemen dezi, men si nou bay moun yon altènatif pwòp ak byen konsève, li pral tou dousman travay tèt li soti.
 Menm jan ak lòt bout pak la, nou fèmen lòt bout Grove Street Railroad Bridge pou rezon sekirite piblik.
 Rezidan yo te monte mi yo ankò, jan moun t ap fè, men tout bagay te sanble rezoud tèt li.
 Se konsa, nou panse ke sa pral rive sou tan tou.
 Rezoud li pou kont li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2930.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Zoe, mwen wè men ou.
 Si ou ka ba nou non ak adrès ou anrejistre.
 Wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2935.229s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Mwen se Zoe Moutsos ki soti nan 33 Johnson Avenue.
 Bonjou Dave.
 Vwazen Dave.
 Mwen se yon entru k ap travèse pwopriyete w la nan pak la.
 Mwen vle pale sou moun ki rete sou zile a nan avni Taylor ak Johnson.
 Se poutèt sa nou fè sa.
 Nan plan orijinal yo mwen te wè yon antre sou Newton Road ki ta bon.
 Mwen pa konnen poukisa li te retire oswa poukisa li pa rive, men nou ap viv nan yon pati nan Medford ki pa gen aksè fasil nan espas vèt ditou.
 Pitit nou yo te oblije travèse plizyè lari ki chaje ak pè.
 Pou kòmanse blag la, li te di nou te aktyèlman travèse yon ray tren epi answit nou vire adwat sou wout la pou rive nan ti pak sa a.
 Ou konnen, nou dwe travèse lari a sof si nou ka mache nan makèt la ak nan pak la.
 Ou konnen, nou ap pase nan Grove Street, ki se tankou yon gran wout.
 Se konsa, mwen panse se pou sa.
 Se poutèt sa mwen pa sonje ki lang Ryan te itilize, se poutèt sa moun te deplase nan direksyon sa, e se poutèt sa nou te tèlman desi lè plan an pa te swiv ak fèmen.
 Mwen te panse nou ta ka fè yon bagay la, koupe kèk pye bwa epi kite moun antre epi yo pa mache sou tè Dave a, paske mwen konnen se pa,
 Anpil pa t ideyal, men opsyon yo te rete ak yo te kouri nan trafik ak mache sou santye ak timoun ak chen nan fènwa ak limyè pòv. Mwen gen dout ke wout la ase lajè pou li konfòme ADA.
 Mwen pa ka imajine li se konsa.
 Kounye a li plen twou, plen vè, tout bon,
 Pifò nan pak sa a bèl e mwen konnen li pral bèl bagay lè yo bati l, men sou Johnson Boulevard, omwen pou mwen, li se yon gwo desepsyon, e mwen konnen lòt moun nan zòn nan fondamantalman kole sou yon gran wout ankò ak moun ki vitès.
 Epi nou pa t 'kapab rive nan espas vèt ki pi pre a.
 Se konsa, mwen devine sa m ap di a se petèt nou ta ka konsidere mete Newton Road la.
 Epitou, apa de tout dispozisyon mwen sou sa a, mèsi pou koute.
 Gen anpil entrigan nan pak sa a.
 Gen veri nwa, moutad lay, pwazon ivy, jan sa nesesè, kòm si anvayisè yo pa t sèlman Nòvejyen, dwa?
 Donk m ap mande: èske gen yon plan pou fè fas ak entrigan sa yo lè gen moun deyò?
 Paske, o Bondye mwen, de dènye ane yo nan moutad lay, si ou renmen sa,
 Pwòpte pak.
 Mwen pa konnen de kisa nap pale.
 Nou pa t 'reyèlman konsantre sou zòn sa a nan Demo sa a, men si ou gade ak anpil atansyon, teren ki vid nan Newton Road kounye a prèske nèt kouvri ak moutad lay ak veri nwa.
 Sa a pral sèlman kontinye vin pi mal.
 Antouka, mèsi.
 Mwen te konnen li ta bon, men mwen te reyèlman vle konsidere aksè an sekirite ak lefèt ke Grove Street se vreman danjere.
 Moun yo kondwi trè vit sou wout sa a.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3125.498s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi Zoe.
 Mwen abite nan Grove Street tou pou m ka tande w byen klè.
 Mwen vle pale ak John Ardizzone paske mwen wè ou leve men ou, mwen te wè sa deja, e mwen konnen ou pa t 'sèvi ak men ou sou Zoom.
 Kidonk mwen jis eseye anpeche w leve men w.
 Kidonk, John, si w vle dekole epi nou ka jwenn non w ak adrès ou pou w anrejistre, tanpri kontakte nou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3147.976s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: John Art te viv nan 53 Johnson Avenue pou sèlman 30 ane.
 Se konsa, mwen konnen tout istwa a nan pak sa a.
 Mwen posede 69 Grove Street.
 Lokatè mwen an se David.
 Moun ap travèse antre kay mwen an pou yo ale nan pak la epi se pa konsa li ta dwe ye.
 Li te sipoze fèmen.
 Se jis yon kesyon.
 Lòt pwoblèm nan se ke tout tan ou ap fè anpil lajan, gen anpil trafik nan lari sa a, epi ou ap mete plis ak plis trafik sou li.
 Lòt bagay la se ke nou ap pale de moun ki pote timoun yo.
 Sa a se teknikman yon pak chen.
 Mwen se youn nan yo e mwen te isit la pi lontan pase nenpòt lòt moun nan foto sa a.
 Peter, Ryan, nenpòt nan mesye sa yo vini.
 Yo pa t rete la osi lontan ke mwen te fè.
 Mwen te la lè se te yon jaden viktwa e te gen jaden kominotè la.
 trè bèl.
 Sa w ap di se lè yo te konstwi miray la, yo te detwi tout plant yo ak tout pyebwa ki dèyè miray la.
 Moun ki te bati miray la te oblije leve l ak anpil atansyon, menm jan yo te fè anlè makèt la.
 Mesye sa yo jis frape li.
 Yo fè yon pil wòch.
 Yon lòt bagay se ou te di vizyon ou trè sansib.
 Yo pran senk a dis wou wòch twa ka pous nan garaj mwen an, yo pran yo apa, epi yo jete yo nan jaden yo.
 OK?
 Wòch sa a ta dwe itilize kòm fondasyon pou bèl miray sa a yo te bati.
 Yo pa janm sèvi ak okenn wòch.
 Lè yo te fini, yo te antre ak yon pèl ak bagay yo nivele.
 Mwen travay nan zòn nan.
 Mwen te travay nan domèn sa a pou 30 ane.
 Mwen konnen istwa li.
 W ap pale de kanal ak fouyman akeyolojik.
 Vil la, vil la, te la koupe zèb la ak detwi plas la pou ane.
 Grove Street te konn trè trankil.
 Koulye a, tout sa ou dwe fè se tande son an nan tren an pandan w ap netwaye tout tenten ki ozalantou wòch sa yo.
 Ou gen aktyèlman antre epi koupe 20 pye yo dèyè miray sa a ak frape desann tout mi yo la.
 Yo pa t kòmanse konsa.
 Lè yo te kòmanse bati pon an, yo te fè li bèl ak pwòp.
 Yo menm te itilize wòch nan premye.
 Mwen travay nan endistri konstriksyon.
 Mwen konnen.
 Lè ou se yon tyè nan wout la, bliye sou wòch yo.
 Bliye sou mache nan Woods yo.
 Yo jis detwi tout bagay.
 Se dezòd la kounye a.
 Tout sa ou ta dwe fè se netwaye pak la.
 Bwi, bwè, ou vle pran bous moun.
 Men, bagay la se, tout moun sa yo ap pale sou jan li bèl bagay.
 Yo pa rete bò kote yo.
 Sa a pa afekte yo.
 Ou te blaze yon santye.
 Zanmi mwen Mike David, madanm li se nyès mwen.
 Yon moun t'ap mache chen yo la a dizè nan mitan lannwit.
 Pa te gen timoun e sèl timoun ki te jwe nan pak sa a te rete nan kay ki toupre 69 Grove.
 Yo soti la, yo se timoun hockey.
 Pa gen timoun la, se yon pak pou chen.
 Oke, tout bagay sa yo fou.
 Ou ap pale de yon gwo kote ke ou vle kenbe pwòp ak pwòp.
 Ou kite chen kaka la depi trant ane.
 Pa gen moun ki konnen istwa pwopriyete a.
 W ap pale de istwa, de dlo.
 Yon servitud dlo Massachusetts pase la.
 Gen yon servitu MBTA bò lakay mwen.
 Mwen se sèl vre ko-otè pwopriyete sa a.
 Ou pa janm avèti m.
 Tankou, poukisa?
 Mwen te pale ak depatman transpò a.
 Èske ou ka mete yon pasaj pou pyeton nan fen antre kay mwen an?
 Se konsa, sa k ap pase lè yon moun bay moute?
 Si yo fè bak, yo rive nan pasaj pou pyeton an ankò.
 Sòf si sa nesesè, pasaj pou pyeton yo dwe lokalize nan 120 pye de bilding ki egziste deja.
 Li pa bezwen li.
 Èske ou ka mache? Èske moun ka mache? Ki kote yo prale?
 W ap pale epi lòt moun ap di se sèl kote pou timoun yo.
 Medford gen plis espas vèt.
 Pitit gason m nan se yon bèt sovaj.
 Eksplore tout espas vèt vil la gen pou l ofri.
 Nou gen plis espas vèt nan Medford, Mystic Lake ak Brooks Estates.
 Dwe gen 100 kawo tè nan do a.
 Ou dwe travèse wout la pou rive nan espas vèt la.
 Moun k ap viv nan West Medford gen anpil chans.
 Rezilta a se ke yo detwi li lè yo fè sa.
 Antre epi netwaye pak la.
 Mi antre mwen, poukisa ou pa fini li?
 Ou bati yon miray, bati yon twotwa, ranmase l, epi voye pèp ou a demen fini miray la.
 Poukisa ou pa fè sa?
 Ou panse si ou te rete nan Sipè Makèt 69 epi yon moun te kondwi nan machin ou lè ou te deyò ak sou, ou ta vin fou.
 A 10 pm, te gen moun k ap mache chen.
 Li pa nan lakou ou, kidonk li pa pral deranje ou.
 Yon moun ap viv nan Jackson Road, nan Tyler ak nan John.
 Okenn nan moun sa yo pa t rete la osi lontan ke mwen te fè.
 Mwen te la epi mwen pa janm gen yon pwoblèm.
 Bèl katye.
 Forè a te pi bèl lè sa a pase kounye a.
 Ou pa t 'veye yo nan ane sa yo.
 De tan zan tan, ou koupe gazon yo.
 Ouvèti sa a, antre sa a, se yon ti ouvèti.
 Sa ki te pase yo te retire gwo wòch la pou yo te ka mete tondèz la ladan l.
 Se konsa tout te kòmanse.
 Mwen posede kay sa a depi 2003 e mwen te rete sou Johnson Avenue pou 30 ane.
 Mwen jis vann kay mwen an men mwen toujou posede 69 Episri.
 Mwen te deja pran kontak.
 Depatman trafik la ap vini.
 Yo pa vle pwoblèm la.
 Nou pa janm gen okenn pwoblèm sou Johnson Blvd.
 Yo detwi yon lòt seksyon nan Johnson Avenue kote li rankontre makèt la.
 Yo detwi zòn sa a.
 Pa janm gen okenn aksidan la.
 Juan, mèsi anpil pou kòmantè ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3494.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Kounye a mwen bezwen ale nan kèk nan lòt kòmantè yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3496.549s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Ou ta dwe avèti m '.
 Ou pa janm avèti m.
 Mwen se sèl vwazen an.
 Mwen pap janm enfòme w.
 Mwen te resevwa yon notifikasyon nan men vwazen mwen an.
 Èske w konnen sa yo fè?
 Ou ka chwazi pòch lòt moun.
 Li pa nan lakou ou, kidonk li pa pral deranje ou.
 Se tout.
 Ou vle plant pwogrese.
 Wap fouye bagay epi mesye sa yo kraze plas la epi ou di se yon bagay delika.
 Mwen pral pèmèt ou vin nan byen mwen an ak 510 wou wòch epi voye yo la san yo pa menm mande m '.
 Li gen polis la.
 Yo te di, hey, si yo domaje antre kay la, yo dwe ranje li.
 Ki moun ki pèmèt sa?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3532.841s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Juan, mèsi anpil.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3545.777s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Wi, mèsi anpil, Frank Miller.
 John te di, mwen abite nan 56 Grove, donk mwen se youn nan vwazen yo.
 Se konsa, mwen rete tou pre pak la, pi pre pase kote John ap viv la.
 Pitit pitit mwen jwe la tout tan.
 Li gen 10 zan.
 Li te itilize li anpil.
 Mwen te wè lòt timoun la tou pou mwen te konnen li te itilize.
 Natirèlman, moun mache chen yo la tou, men lòt pase sa, gen jis kèk bagay.
 Premyerman, mèsi anpil.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon amelyorasyon enpòtan.
 Mwen byen kontan ou te netwaye tout bagay.
 Ak tout bwa ki mouri ak pye bwa ki mouri, mwen te toujou enkyete ke yo ta pran dife.
 Se konsa, sa a se yon gwo amelyorasyon.
 Mwen renmen tout sa ou fè.
 Sèl bagay mwen yon ti kras desi se paske mwen panse ke nan plan orijinal la ou te di li pral gen twotwa gri, men li sanble ke ou te abandone sa.
 Se konsa, li toujou posib?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3602.83s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Se konsa, nou te diskite sou konstriksyon pasaj pyeton ki wo ak depatman transpò a, pwoblèm nan se ke sa a te enplike enstale basen trape ki te ajoute gwo pri.
 Si li pa la deja.
 Nan pifò ka yo, nou rekòmande pou enstale yon pasaj pou pyeton nan yon kote ki pa gen pasaj pou piton tou pre.
 Donk nou konsantre sou baryè ki la.
 Nou ka itilize trafik la pou eseye ajoute yon lòt.
 Yon lòt bagay nou te diskite avèk yo te petèt kreye yon zòn sekirite nan kwen pak la pou limit vitès la pa ta dwe 25kmh atravè vil la. Tankou 20 mil yon èdtan.
 Men, nou konnen moun yo vitès sou wout sa a, vizibilite se yon pwoblèm, ak kèk moun ki vle ralanti yo rete an sekirite.
 Nou konnen se yon chemen kout pou ale nan sèten kote.
 Mwen te kondui isit la tèt mwen soti nan lòt pati nan Medford, men petèt mande moun yo ralanti ta ede rann li pi an sekirite.
 Petèt menm lè l sèvi avèk li ak siyal ta ede.
 Fè li yon ti kras pi an sekirite.
 Men, si nou ka bati pasaj ki wo, nou pral.
 Men, lòt pase sa, nou pral fè opoze a epi asire ranp yo aksesib sou tou de bò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3693.153s">[SPEAKER_03]</a>: Mèsi anpil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3705.668s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Oke, alo, Diane Noel.
 Mwen rete nan 11 Newton Road, One House Inn anfas pak la.
 Mwen panse mwen dakò ak tout moun ki pale isit la, omwen nan yon sans, ki se, mèsi anpil pou diskou sa a.
 Mwen enpresyone ak fyè dèske n ap gade istwa Medford a epi n ap reflechi pwofondman sou li.
 Donk, mèsi paske w fè travay sa a.
 Menm jan ak John, mwen ta di mwen panse ke yon sans de kominote se kle.
 Mwen santi mwen tankou si mwen pa t 'abònman nan bilten ou a epi pa te gen okenn enterè nan sijè sa a, mwen pa ta tande pale sou reyinyon sa a aswè a.
 Mwen panse ke gen anpil moun ki enterese nan kominote a ki jis pa konnen yon desizyon ap pran.
 Donk mwen pa konnen si sa literal.
 Lè w gade kominote sa a nan pèspektiv John, mwen pa panse ke gen anpil transparans nan pran desizyon e gen anpil enterè.
 Uh, bè ak manm kominote yo, mwen panse ke yo vle omwen gen konsyans, si se pa kapasite, pou yo, ou konnen, pale nan reyinyon yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3777.742s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Èske mwen ka entèwonp byen vit epi poze yon kesyon bay piblik la?
 Pou moun nan nou ki deyò yo, èske youn nan nou te resevwa yon apèl 911 inverse paske nou te mande vil la fè yon sèl de semèn de sa epi si li pa te fè, mwen konnen yo pral mete l 'nan kalandriye vil la, men èske mwen te mande yo?
 Apèl ranvèse a se jis pou fè mesaj la atravè, ou konnen, nou vle asire w ke ou konnen ki moun ou konnen gen lòt fason, mwen poste sa a sou rezo sosyal ak vil la mete l 'sou kalandriye yo, men, wi, nou konnen se pa tout moun ki sou Facebook, se pa tout moun ki sou rezo sosyal, kidonk ou konnen, nou vle asire w ke nou gen moun ki tankou ou, John, ou konnen, ki koute mesaj yo renmen ak tout moun ki abitye reponn.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3819.423s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mwen te resevwa youn, men mwen vle di, mwen abite lòt bò Grove a epi mwen te enskri pou alèt vil la.
 Se konsa, tout moun enskri pou alèt vil la?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3826.977s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Wi, mwen pa t resevwa li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3829.032s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Oke, ann wè poukisa nou espesyalman mande pou li. Mwen vle di, mwen konnen li te anile paske mwen te resevwa li.
 Men, ki pwen an? Mwen vle di, mwen òganize yon konferans.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3836.496s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Se konsa, si mwen ka jis yon ti tan kouvri sa a, si ou te enskri pou alèt vil la epi ou pa t ', epi ou nan zòn nan epi ou pa jwenn yon mesaj, adrès ou a ka pa nan sistèm nan.
 Sa a se sa nou panse se pwoblèm nan.
 Pou fè sa, ou ka vizite alèt yo sou sit entènèt vil la.
 Ou ka pèsonalize li, swa sou telefòn ou, ou ka resevwa li pa imel si se yon mesaj tèks, ou ka resevwa li sou liy fiks ou sou fòm papye olye de papye.
 Men, si ou pa gen yon adrès la, ou p ap resevwa yon mesaj lokalize konsa.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle moun yo dwe okouran de sa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3876.048s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Wi, mwen konnen li difisil, mwen konnen pèsonn pa ka jwenn yon travay ankò, men mwen vle di, definitivman gen yon fason, kit se tradisyonèl oswa medya sosyal.
 Mwen jis konnen li difisil pou konsantre sou reyinyon sa yo e gen anpil moun ki enterese nan pak sa a, nan kominote sa a.
 Mwen panse ke yo ta apresye plis konsyans.
 Se konsa, si ou ta ka mete plis efò nan yon chemen diferan, omwen
 Gaye pawòl la.
 Mwen panse ke sa a pral itil.
 Mwen ta renmen repete yon lòt moun ki fè kòmantè fèmen antre Newton Road la.
 Li evidan, kòm yon pasan Newton, mwen reyèlman manke li.
 Sa fè nan fen pak la prèske yon bout mouri.
 Bò sid la se pa sèlman pou aksè, men tou pou plezi.
 Trè kèk moun ale nan mitan an nan pak la ak Lè sa a, tounen nan zòn sa a, ki te aktyèlman antre pou tout moun sou bò sid anvan yo te fèmen pak la.
 Mwen tande fristrasyon John epi mwen tande fristrasyon lokatè a.
 Tout moun fristre.
 Ou konnen, nou vle l tounen.
 Nou te vle antre nan tounen pou louvri tout longè pak la.
 Se konsa, mwen konnen li se yon mesaj trè konsistan pou prèske tout moun bò kote isit la
 Anplis de sa, petèt John gen dwa pou l sipòte.
 Men, ou konnen, jis mete yon antre epi tout moun jwenn li.
 Lè sa a, mwen, mwen, kòmantè mwen an, ki mwen panse se inik epi ki pa janm te di jiska kounye a.
 Ankò, mwen panse ke plan an se gwo.
 Mwen panse ke sa ou te fè te gwo.
 Enkyetid mwen se toujou sou antretyen ak eta fiti.
 Se yon sèl bagay pou gen yon bèl pak ak bèl foto, men jan nou te wè, si ou pa gen bidjè a oswa panse yo kenbe li,
 Li ka vin reyèlman move nan yon tan trè kout.
 Kidonk, lè w ap planifye, reflechi sou li epi gen yon atik nan bidjè w oswa nan lide w sou fason pou w kenbe l gade pi bon ke posib nan jou egzekisyon an.
 Se konsa, mèsi.
 Mèsi, Diana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4024.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Mwen jis vle ale nan nòt sa a.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon bon konsèp ke tout vil la ta dwe genyen.
 Mwen ta trete jaden flè sa a tankou yon bilding istorik.
 Ase li pou di, plis antretyen ak prezèvasyon ou fè, mwens antretyen ak mizajou ou bezwen.
 Alor wi, nou pe avanse dan netwayaz sa park e nou anvi ki i reste prop, byen antretenir e byen servi pour li ganny sa bidze ki i merite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4055.632s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bon, pwochen kòmantatè a se C. Mariano.
 Si ou ta renmen ban nou non ou ak adrès ou pou anrejistreman, tanpri.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4062.178s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Se te aktyèlman mari l, Terrodon Collins, nan 91 Ravine Road.
 Gen anpil bagay k ap pase.
 Mwen renmen plan mèt la.
 Sanble byen.
 Gen anpil pye bèl ti flè nwa la.
 Se tankou fè yon pwojè lakay ou, pa vre?
 Drapo akeyolojik la toujou la.
 Se konsa, sa a se fatra.
 Ou pran chemen sa yo.
 Mwen pase omwen 30 minit nan forè sa a chak jou, chak jou.
 Pitit gason m nan ak mwen te soti epi yo te oblije netwaye tout vè kase ke bòs mason miray yo te jete ki te bloke wout la.
 Nou poko menm pre.
 Si ou ale deyò epi eseye bati yon twotwa sou bò Bosque, bò sa a pa ase lajè.
 Koulye a, chemen ou a pa ase lajè.
 Se poutèt sa, miray la ta dwe pouse tounen nan pwen sa a pou soulaje pwoblèm Jan an.
 Mwen dakò, ta dwe gen yon antre sid, 100%.
 Rès pye bwa ki rete yo lakòz tout kominote yo pran nan forè pou jete fatra yo.
 Li tounen yon pil fatra ankò e ankò.
 Mwen dakò sou espès anvayisan yo.
 Nou toujou ale deyò epi jete moutad lay.
 Mwen fè sa chak fwa mwen mache chen mwen an.
 Mwen t ap bwè moutad lay epi mwen te pran sant li epi, ou konnen, nou te fè chanjman nan kèk zòn, men
 Tout zòn sa a te yon fwa trè bèl.
 Depi wout la sal ak gwo twou san fon, kounye a gen pil labou.
 Gen vè.
 Mwen pa ka jwenn sou kantite vè kraze miray yo.
 Sa a se ridikil.
 Gen anpil plis pou fè.
 Men, sa ki enkyete tout moun se ke sa a se pa yon pak.
 Sa a se yon pak lokal.
 Sa p ap yon atraksyon pou moun vin vizite nou.
 Mwen rete devan yon miray.
 Petèt kat fwa nan yon ane, mwen wè yon moun kanpe nan Grove Street epi li mache al li siy la.
 Ou konnen sa mwen vle di?
 Se konsa, mwen vrèman apresye lide amelyorasyon, men mwen panse ke ou jis bezwen evalye tèt ou pou konnen si pral gen yon tiraj.
 bay piblik la an jeneral.
 Ou konnen sa mwen vle di?
 Se poutèt sa, bagay ki pi enpòtan an se opinyon moun ki bò kote w, tou de dirèkteman ak sou wout ki bò kote w.
 Mwen vle di, si ta pral gen yon jaden viktwa la ak ... yon jaden viktwa pa posib.
 Bon, sa bon paske nou te gen yon konvèsasyon entèn paske nou gen yon pwoblèm rat nan tout zòn nan.
 Se konsa, tout bagay anfòm.
 Kidonk, se menm bagay la, men, ou konnen, jaden yo apèn koupe, petèt de fwa nan yon ane.
 Menm soti nan ou, toujou gen anpil gravye.
 Se konsa, yon jou mwen retire baz yon kòn nan pak la epi mete l sou bò wout la nan espwa ke yon moun nan vil ta finalman vin jwenn li.
 Paske li la depi ke miray la te bati.
 Oke, mwen te wè ke yon fwa nan yon solisyon klike sou C ak yon moun plenyen sou moun ap jete fatra la.
 Mwen panse ke li te tounen yon diskisyon ak nenpòt moun ki te vin wè l ', men
 Mwen vle di, si ou pa fè sa, si ou kòmanse yon pwojè epi trete li tankou yon vye bagay, moun yo pral vire tèt yo epi yo panse, o, sa a toujou yon vye bagay.
 Mwen ka fè sa mwen vle ak li.
 Se poutèt sa, premye faz nan pwojè a parèt yo te inisye men li poko fini.
 Ou konnen, te gen drapo alantou gad yo e li te degoutan yo te la.
 Mwen te konn pi janti avèk ou anvan mi yo te kòmanse di ou verite a.
 Mwen espere ke plan ou te fè yo rive reyalize epi yo disparèt.
 Mwen byen kontan, ou konnen, mwen swete li te toujou sou boardwalk la, sou pon an nan pak la, paske ankò moun yo dwe mache nan tèt la.
 Timoun yo oblije mache nan ak alantou Grove Street.
 Mwen di w Mike, kloti a desann.
 Ou konnen, pitit gason m nan te mache atravè ray tren yo paske li te prèske pi an sekirite pase k ap monte kwen Grove pou ale nan sant rekreyasyon an.
 Ou konnen, sa yo se enkyetid mwen yo.
 Genyen anpil nan yo.
 Mwen ta dwe fè yon lis, men li ta ka pran 30 minit.
 Men, definitivman, li pral enplike plis moun nan lokalite, ou konnen, paske si ou pa abite isit la, ou pa vin nan pak sa a.
 Ou konnen, sa a se pa yon pakin.
 Sa a se pa yon hickey.
 Se pa anyen konsa.
 Lè sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4334.142s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi anpil e si w gen plis lide tanpri pa ezite voye yon imèl ba nou.
 Ou konnen, se yon konvèsasyon kontinyèl.
 Mwen toujou gen yon ti kras plis.
 Tann, John.
 John, mwen bezwen sa e mwen gen lòt moun ki leve men yo donk mwen te vle fè kòmantè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4351.289s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Trè vit.
 Diane t'ap pale de pitit gason l' ki t'ap mache sou twotwa a e ki t'ap mennen moun la.
 Ki jan moun ta santi yo si yo te rete la?
 Yo te gen timoun, moun k ap mache sou twotwa a.
 Konfidansyalite mwen an la.
 Poukisa yo pa fèmen miray la epi kite ouvèti a nan mitan lari a?
 Mwen pa konprann poukisa yo pa fè sa.
 Fèmen miray sa a demen epi ouvri li nan Grove Street.
 Twotwa sa a, tankou mwen te dwat, twotwa sa a pa t ase lajè pou konstitye twotwa sa a.
 Mi yo te mal fè ak anndan an te yon dezòd.
 Epi li fè bwi pase anvan paske se la tout fatra soti.
 Yo bezwen tounen nan premye faz.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4392.777s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi, John.
 Mèsi anpil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4397.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Anvan moun sote nan, kite m 'bay kèk klarifikasyon ki ta ka ede.
 Se konsa, gen kèk bagay diferan k ap pase nan diskisyon an sou fini sa a fini.
 Nou pa ka mete yon pasaj pou pyeton la paske gen yon pasaj pou pyeton deja.
 Nou pa vle pèsonn pase nan papòt la.
 Men, san konte sa,
 Jan mwen te mansyone anvan, nou vle konsantre trafik nan entèseksyon prensipal Jackson Road, kidonk twotwa yo nesesè.
 Tout miray la gen senk pye longè.
 Genyen aktyèlman kote ki gen plis pase sa, men senk pye.
 Twotwa ADA yo dwe 48 pous ant miray ak twotwa epi yo dwe genyen 36 pous espas klè.
 Nou genyen sa.
 Kèk jou de sa nou te
 pak.
 An tèm de pri, nou ta gade nan pri a nan relouvri miray la oswa elaji twotwa a.
 Twotwa sou Jackson Road yo pi bon mache, anviwon $10,000.
 Sa ap koute yon bagay tankou
 $36,000 pou fè kontraktè a tounen, deplase kay la, louvri mi yo, retire pasaj la, retraye mi yo ak louvri ouvèti yo.
 Li koute anviwon $20,000 oswa mwens, sa depann de ki jan li gen rapò ak pi gwo pwojè a, plasman twotwa, plasman koupe twotwa, plasman pasaj pou pyeton yo ak siyal.
 Se konsa, nou jis ap eseye peze avantaj yo ak dezavantaj nan tou de.
 Antre piblik e asire nou responsab fiskal pou kantite revni taks nou resevwa.
 Men, ankò, sa a se tout moute pou deba.
 Mesye, sa a se yon opinyon.
 Lè sa a, trafik ka toudenkou di: Non, pa fè sa.
 Ann tounen nan lide bati yon miray, ann jis fè li.
 Men, ou konnen, nou dwe tou bay ekipman ADA pou asire ke pak la aksesib paske nou te resevwa fidbak ke moun vle itilize pak la epi nou gen yon obligasyon pou fè sa.
 Kòm yon pati nan travay preliminè a, nou te vle di ke si nou ta louvri ak fèmen antre yo, yo tout ta dwe aksesib.
 Ou konnen, tout moun gen aksè nan pak la, menm si moun nan lòt pati nan kominote a pa sèvi ak li, li la pou li kapab.
 OK
 Donk mon panse konsansis jeneral se ke menm si piblik la pa vin wè li, yo ka wè li si yo vle.
 Ou sètènman pa ka kite nenpòt moun oswa nenpòt moun fè sa.
 Men, ou konnen, mwen.
 Natirèlman ou vle sa a travay pou ou kòm yon vwazen, men nou bezwen tou asire w ke nou ap fè tout sa nou kapab pou fè travay sa a pou vil la an antye.
 Ou konnen, M-Belt la ak fanmi wa a gen pwòp ti atraksyon yo, men sa a se reyèlman pak la sèlman nan vil la ki selebre listwa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4565.828s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Benjamin O'Cardy, ou ka kite kòmantè ou yo.
 Si nou ka jwenn non w ak adrès ou pou anrejistreman, tanpri.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4572.062s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Bonjou tout moun, mwen se Olga, Katie e mwen se madanm Benjamin.
 Mwen gen kèk opinyon yo pataje.
 Nou nan 38 Jackson Road.
 Donk, mèsi pou diskou w la.
 Ou klèman te pran anpil opinyon nan men kominote a an konsiderasyon lè w te desine prezantasyon w la epi w te vini ak yon entèpretasyon altènatif pou faz de.
 Kidonk mwen remèsye w dèske w koute kominote a ak anpil atansyon, sitou nou menm ki sèvi ak pak yo chak jou epi
 Trè aktif nan pwoteje li epi ede manm kominote sa a.
 Kòmantè mwen te fè yo espesyalman gen rapò ak planifikasyon ak antretyen nan pye bwa pak ak baryè son.
 Kidonk, mwen menm ak mari m te remake pandan twazan ki sot pase yo ke nou te abite isit la ke baryè son an te konplètman kraze depi premye faz la te konplete.
 Bri tren an se
 Sa a se ridikil, kay nou an ap tranble.
 Se te kòmsi te gen plizyè ti tranblemanntè chak jou, ki te koze pa tranbleman pye bwa yo te tonbe pandan premye pati reparasyon miray la.
 Kidonk, mwen trè konsène pou lòt pye bwa ki pral koupe pita nan pwojè a paske byenke kèk nouvo pye bwa pral plante nou espere tan an pa matche paske li pral pran tan pou pye bwa sa yo rive nan yon nivo matirite.
 Pyebwa yo koupe kounye a gen 20 oswa 30 ane fin vye granmoun.
 Se poutèt sa, li pral pran kèk tan anvan yo vin baryè son efikas.
 An menm tan an, bri tren an se ridikil.
 Vibrasyon yo te terib an tèm de baryè a son kraze ki te fèt.
 Li ka mennen nan pwoblèm fondasyon ak ekstèn negatif adisyonèl ke ou ka pa te orijinèlman konsidere lè konsepsyon pwojè a.
 Alor mon krwar lezot mezir i neseser.
 Yo te pran mezi pou redwi enpak baryè son an lè yo koupe lòt pye bwa, e nenpòt ki pye bwa yo te plante te oblije grandi trè vit pou ranplase baryè son an.
 ASAP.
 Mon dezyenm kestyon i konsern antretyen sa bann pye dibwa.
 Espesyalman, ki moun ki pral jere pwojè sa yo?
 Èske se Depatman forè Medford?
 Èske li pral yon arborist pèsonèl?
 Èske yo mete lajan sou kote pou wouze nouvo pye bwa sa yo epi asire yo siviv?
 Akoz bann pye dibwa ki ganny plante Medford, premyerman, bann nouvo pye dibwa i pran bokou letan pou plante pour bann rezon ki nou pa pou antre ladan ozordi, e bann pye dibwa osi pa ganny antretenir akoz personn pa aroze akoz napa larzan.
 Se poutèt sa, nenpòt pyebwa ki fèk plante pral esansyèlman mande pou omwen twa ane nan swen regilye asire siviv li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4741.324s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Wi, lè sa a,
 Ou konnen, lè mwen t ap eseye vini ak bon lide pou baryè son, ou konnen, petèt li ta fè sans pou jwenn yon fason yo anbeli fwontyè a sou bò ray tren ak plis touf ki ba pou difize bri a nan tout pak la.
 Epi, ou konnen, petèt nou ka ogmante bidjè pyebwa a.
 Se konsa, sa a se yon bagay nou ka sètènman diskite ak Peter, achitèk nan jaden flè, ki moun ki ka sètènman ede ak gade nan sa.
 Nou ka rezoud pwoblèm sa a.
 Nou ka eseye wè sa.
 Kòm yon moun mansyone, kloti MBTA a desann.
 Nou vle asire w ke yon fwa travay pyebwa a fini, li travay ankò.
 Nan fason sa a p ap gen travèse ki pa an sekirite ankò paske tren yo pral kite yon fwa konstriksyon an fini.
 Ou konnen, tout vapè devan, se pa tout moun ki sispann la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4806.644s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Se konsa, mwen pa vle di anpil, men mwen menm ak pitit gason m 'ka ateste sa paske li te takine m' nan tan lontan an, men.
 Nou aktyèlman te eseye netwaye Poms Walter Ravine a sou bò wout la ak soti dèyè, nou aktyèlman rale move zèb yo ak antre epi yo te plante flè natif natal, tankou yon jaden polinizatè reyèl la.
 Te gen pousyè tè devan ak dèyè miray la, pa gen pousyè tè, pousyè tè, pa gen anyen anba, jis wòch.
 Nou aktyèlman te gen zanmi ane sa a bay diferan flè raje ak anpoul diferan epi nou ap eseye plante yo nan baz la nan miray la, ou konnen, sou bò a, si ou konnen zòn nan, gen yon pye bwa, tankou yon ti boul dèyè bò gòch nan miray la.
 Men, yon sèl bagay pou w sonje bagay se san mank wouze jan mwen pa sèten okenn nan yo ap kenbe.
 Grenn mwen yo, mwen te mete soti $60 yon valè de grenn ane sa a ak $80 yon valè de grenn ane pase.
 Nou te gen kèk ki te pran yon ti tan, men mwen rayi di pawòl sa a paske gen moun ki pa renmen li, mwen pa konnen ki moun ki la, men ak chanjman nan klima, li te fè yon sezon fredi trè cho ak sèk.
 Si w ap viv isit la, ou konnen kote solèy la soti.
 Limyè solèy la pa nesesèman frape zòn nan dirèkteman.
 Lè sa a, li nan super super sèk, pa gen okenn pousyè tè.
 Pa gen etaj.
 Dirèkteman sou chak bò miray sa a.
 Yon fwa w antre oswa pase l, w ap jwenn pousyè tè ak anpil move zèb.
 Men, si ou vle fè yon bagay dekoratif, tankou flè raje oswa nenpòt lòt plant, yon moun dwe pran swen li, espesyalman plante pye bwa.
 Se konsa, pa gen dlo dirèk la.
 Mwen aktyèlman te panse sou mande vwazen mwen yo si mwen te kapab itilize kay kwen yo ak kawotchou desann kay yo lòtbò lari a.
 Mwen panse ke li pa gen okenn sans nan pwen sa a.
 Epi gen move zèb ki gen anpil moun toupatou.
 Mwen vle di, sezon otòn vini yon fwa chak ane nan vil sa a ak zèb la kraze tout bagay.
 Mwen aktyèlman te gen yon jaden k ap grandi ane pase a epi yo te vin debarase m de tout move zèb yo.
 Donk wi.
 Men, se li.
 Mwen jis vle mete aksan sou sa a.
 Si ou vle fè sa, ou gen bidjè pou lòt bagay.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4942.083s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi anpil.
 Mèsi a Olga tou pou kòmantè sa yo, nou pral definitivman revize plan jaden an, pye bwa ak antretyen.
 Mwen te mete ansanm yon lis isit la pou fè w konnen ke nou pral kontakte Peter ak kèk nan kòlèg nou yo pale sou sa a epi reflechi sou li pi pwofondè.
 Mèsi anpil.
 Mèsi.

 Retounen nan fidbak la ankò, mwen panse ke nou ta ka sove $ 36,000 si yo te mande anvan fèmen kloti Newton Road la.
 OK
 Alor mon krwar sa i en fristrasyon ki bokou nou pou fer fas avek.
 Mwen panse tou si ou mande kominote a, ki youn ou prefere?
 Mwen panse ke nou tout ta di nou ta pito gen yon peman an avan pase depanse lajan an.
 Nan lòt mo, rive jwenn kominote a epi jwenn tòn repons, pa sèlman 20 nan nou ase chans jwenn reyinyon sa a.
 Fè yon sondaj Google epi fè yon bagay pou vrèman konstwi konsansis anvan ou pran yon desizyon.
 Ou konnen, nou pa ap mande w koupe aksè sa a.
 Ou te fè li.
 Kounye a nou mande w retounen li.
 Ou te di ke li ta chè, men se pa sa ou ta dwe fè an plas an premye.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon fristrasyon reyèl ke nou tout pataje.

 Bonjou Jen.
 Mwen, ou konnen, mwen reyèlman dakò ak anpil nan manm kominote nou an epi mwen tande fristrasyon John ak fristrasyon Diane ak
 Mwen panse ta dwe gen yon liy aksè sou bò sid Grove Street ki evidamman pa entèfere ak dwa pèsonèl ak pwopriyete pèsonèl yon moun.
 Se konsa, mwen ka tande yo byen fò ak klè.
 Ou konnen, John, mwen konnen ou te la a yon bon bout tan, men mwen te la tou pou plis pase 20 ane.
 Ou konnen, mwen pa nouvo nan kominote sa a, se pa sèlman yon pak pou chen.
 Nou te wè anpil timoun ki t ap antre ak soti la.
 Mwen renmen pak sa a.
 Mwen konnen gen, ou konnen,
 Anpil nan nou ezite chanje, pa vre?
 Lè nou laj, nou rive nan yon etap nan lavi nou kote nou pa vle wè twòp chanjman.
 Men, pou mwen, mwen wè nou chita nan yon kominote kote nou ka vrèman angaje ak bagay istorik.
 Mwen menm mwen pa vle akable katye nou yo ak otobis ak tralye timoun lekòl, oswa inondasyon espas piblik yo an gwo kantite.
 Men, an menm tan, gen yon istwa isit la ke mwen panse ke nou ta dwe apresye.
 Kidonk, panse mwen se, ou konnen, ann fè sa nan fason reflechi, reflechi, oryante nan kominote a ke mwen panse ke moun yo ap fè li, olye ke yo eseye pote nan yon anpil nan trafik ki pa nesesè.
 Men, an menm tan an, sa a se yon zòn ki ka itil pou:
 Ou konnen timoun yo nan Brooks School renmen mache nan lari a yon jou nan sezon prentan an epi ale nan yon vwayaj randone kote yo aprann yon ti kras plis sou istwa a nan zòn nan e mwen panse ke sa a trè enpòtan pou yo.
 Mwen menm, tankou anpil lòt moun, petèt nan konferans sa a, mwen pa vle pou yo bliye istwa.
 Mwen espere ke istwa sa a apresye, e mwen panse ke gen yon bagay trè enteresan sou konstriksyon ak itilizasyon bato sa a.
 Chanèl ak lòt bagay ki sanble ka gen yon valè reyèl.
 Se tout sa mwen gen pou di, men mwen apresye swen ak konsiderasyon ki te antre nan tout bagay sa yo.
 Men, mwen pa gen menm enkyetid sou chanjman, osi lontan ke li reflete kominote a ak konpreyansyon moun yo ke gen pati reyèl nan istwa a isit la ki ka rakonte ak eksplore nan yon fason ki san danje epi ki enb.
 Mwen apresye tout moun ki fè sa yo fè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5346.996s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi, Tamara.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5378.95s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Alo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5382.413s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Bonjou, ou ta renmen kite yon kòmantè?
 Wi tanpri.
 Èske mwen ka gen non ou ak adrès ou pou mwen ka anrejistre?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5388.638s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Bonjou Bill Stevens, Wellgate Road.
 Mèsi anpil.
 Next.
 Tankou tout lòt moun, mwen te rete isit la pou apeprè 30 ane.
 Mwen yon ti kras konsène paske mwen panse w ap avanse ak tout pwojè sa a san yo pa pale ak vwazen ou oswa rezidan yo nan kominote sa a.
 Mwen renmen tou espas vèt yo.
 Mwen renmen lak misterye.
 Mwen renmen ti pak sa nou genyen la.
 Mwen pa renmen chanjman sa a men mwen wè yo ap eseye fè pak la pi aksesib pou chèz woulant ak moun ki andikape, men mwen panse
 Pa gen moun ki reyèlman panse sou ki kote yo pake kamyon ADA oswa ki kalite machin yo pake sou ale ou pwopoze a.
 Mwen te gade plan etaj la e jiskaprezan mwen te wè de espas pakin nan lari bò a.
 Èske nenpòt moun ka esplike m ki jan yo ka pake yon kamyon ADA nan yon lari bò epi pèmèt aksè chèz woulant?
 Anvan pwojè sa a, èske gen moun ki te janm panse sou pwogrè ADA twotwa yo te fè?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5452.147s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Kidonk, pwochen etap nou an se pran konsepsyon chema ki egziste deja a epi travay ak enjenyè ki soti nan depatman transpò, DPW ak depatman planifikasyon pou vrèman fouye nan detay sou pwoblèm sa a.
 Ou konnen, ki jan sa a travay oswa ou pa travay?
 Park kamyon w lan oswa machin ADA nan lari a oswa sou plas, ou konnen, yon kote, pa vre?
 Donk detay sa yo...ou mete lapolis devan mari a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5489.141s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Nou te gen tout konvèsasyon sa yo ak tout lwa dekoupaj an zòn ak chanjman entèn sa yo epi ou poko kalkile ki jan pak sa a aksesib a moun ki andikape yo.
 Se konsa, nou chanje naratif la tout antye pa pèmèt machin yo dwe pake nan pak la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5507.249s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Oke, kominote a te mande nou pa pèmèt machin antre nan pak la, men nan kou... ou pa ka pake nan bò lari a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5512.773s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Nou bezwen 96 pous lajè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5514.875s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Kòrèk.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5515.315s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Kidonk youn nan bagay ki sèten se... ou pa ka mete yon ranp sou bò yon kamyonèt sou twotwa a.
 Sa a se yon pasaj pou rezidan yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5525.148s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Oke, mwen pa sèten paske nou dwe jwenn yon enjenyè pou gade li, men sa a se yon pati nan pwochen pwosesis la kounye a ke nou gen finansman an fè konsepsyon an.
 Prepare pou nou ka omwen prezante yo bay kominote a pou nou ka jwenn repons konkrè sa yo.
 Ou konnen, se sa li ye.
 Kòmansman faz sa a valab, pa vre?
 Natirèlman, konsantre a pral sou adrese pwoblèm sekirite, pye bwa, ak pwoblèm akeyolojik ki pa afekte anyen ankò.
 Mwen pa pral pale sou, ou konnen, sijè ki pi kontwovèsyal, pa vre?
 Se konsa, pou sijè kontwovèsyal sa yo, nou genyen.
 Ou konnen, omwen sis mwa anvan nou soti nan òf oswa bati.
 Se konsa, men nou vle deplase vit, dwa?
 Lè sa a, yon fwa nou gen desen sa yo, nou ka soumèt yo bay kominote a pou fidbak.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5580.401s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Se konsa... Ann vlope sa a an premye.
 Kisa k ap pase si desen sa yo pa travay?
 Nou depanse twazan oswa plis nan kòb ekip nou an nan yon pwojè ki pa ka avanse.
 Se konsa, ki sa ki posib anvan ou envesti tout tan ou ak enèji nan avanse?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5595.956s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Se konsa, li pa yon kesyon de si li fonksyone.
 Se yon kesyon de fè yon bagay mache.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5601.962s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Se konsa, mwen te viv isit la pou 30 ane.
 Mwen te wè otorite pakin nan lari sa a.
 mwen te wè
 Lapolis te eseye ralanti wout la, mete vitès monte, epi wout la te sanble ak yon gran wout.
 Mwen mache wout sa a 15 fwa pa jou pou ale ak soti nan travay, mennen pitit mwen yo nan travay epi answit pran tren an.
 Wout sa a se yon gran wout.
 Ou mete siy sa yo, monte vitès, pa gen anyen pou kontwole vitès la.
 Yeah, reyèlman panse ou ta ka ralanti pou yon moun nan yon chèz woulant ale la,
 Yon moun pral mouri.
 Mwen pa panse ou mesye panse twòp sou li.
 Yo tout se yon bout ki mouri.
 Se konsa, anvan nou ale pi lwen, mwen vle bay li kèk refleksyon serye anvan depanse plis dola taks sou pwojè sa a pase mwen aktyèlman bezwen.
 Mwen konnen sa se yon sibvansyon
 Mwen konnen ki jan li tout travay.
 Mwen konnen vil la ap soufri ak travayè antretyen.
 Pa gen okenn plan antretyen pou pwopriyete sa a nan bidjè nou an.
 Mwen dakò ak dam nan ap pale de pye bwa.
 Toupre, chak pye bwa devan chak kay tonbe.
 Chak kay gen pye bwa pouri.
 Sa a se yon peyi abandone.
 Mwen jis panse ke w ap pouse pou sa a, espesyalman pwovizyon andikap nan sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5683.977s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi Bill.
 Mèsi anpil pou kòmantè ou.
 Nou pral definitivman pran yo an konsiderasyon.
 OK, si ou vle dekole, tanpri kontakte BNIC yon lòt fwa ankò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5697.584s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Bon, koman mwen ye?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5699.865s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Wi, tanpri ale pi devan, mesye.
 Èske nou ka jwenn non ou ak adrès ou pou anrejistreman?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5703.545s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Wi, mwen se Bobby Nicotero ki soti nan 3 Newton Road e mwen te isit la pou tout tan.
 Vè inè nan maten, kay la nan tren an pran tranble.
 Yon koup de nwit, ak Lè sa a, mwen vle di, tout bagay ke tout moun yo ekspoze a isit la, mwen regrèt, mwen te fè eksperyans li dirèkteman oswa endirèkteman, mwen dwe di, lè nou te deplase isit la nan '93, madanm mwen te fè yon kòmantè enteresan.
 Li te di, Bob, mwen te grandi nan Medford, te ale nan Medford High School,
 Mwen te panse mwen te konnen tout bagay sou apwòch la men mwen pa t 'menm konnen sou Rose Street epi mwen pa t' janm te isit la anvan.
 Ou pa ta ka gen plis rezon.
 Sa a se yon sitiyasyon trè lokal, lokalize.
 Nou te trè sansib sou sa paske nou te viv ansanm e mwen te rete bò kote.
 Mwen te wè tout bagay moun mansyone.
 Pou nou onèt, li ta yon wont si li chanje paske se sa pak sa a ak kominote sa a pote bay moun ki abite isit la.
 Moun yo renmen li isit la.
 Tout moun fè li.
 Sa a se yon gwo kominote.
 Men, anvan, John pa t 'kapab gen plis rezon.
 Mwen te bezwen de vwazen pou di m sou reyinyon aswè a, kidonk yo pa t avèti m pou kèk rezon.
 Mwen pa blame pèsonn.
 Se tout
 Li nan 2024 kounye a, kidonk mwen konnen sa a ta dwe omwen ale nan Grovers yo, ak sa yo pi bon.
 Men, ankò, sa a se yon pak lokal.
 Mwen apresye istwa sa a.
 Mwen pa ta janm konnen sou Sagamore Park sof si timoun mwen yo ak zanmi yo te moute desann nan lari yo epi dekouvri ke te gen Endyen natif natal nan pati sa a nan peyi a.
 Istwa a trè enteresan e nou renmen li.
 Men, gen yon cham ak renmen nan istwa ki antoure li.
 Moun yo te reyaji byen pou tout bagay.
 Men, mwen dwe di, Grove Street se tankou yon gan vitès.
 Machin nan parèt akselere oswa frenaj rapidman.
 Malerezman, yon chen te fèk frape ak touye pa yon machin nan Grove.
 Sa a se trè trè tris.
 Apre sa, li tounen lakay li.
 Epi, ou konnen, mwen toujou enkyete ke timoun mwen yo pral mache nan bwa yo ak chen mwen yo pral kouri nan bwa a paske yo te pè, ou konnen, machin yo ap pase.
 Lè kamyon an estasyone sou yon vitès, ou pral tande yon aksidan ak son an nan bagay ki tonbe sou kamyon an.
 Se konsa, tout bagay sa yo ajoute, epi Lè sa a, ou gen yon pak ki gen plis moun ki pakin, mache, ak vizite.
 Ou konnen, twotwa yo etwat.
 san dout.
 Si mwen travèse twotwa sa a, devan kay mwen nan Grove, sou wout tè sa a, li sanble, mwen devine teknikman li ta ka parèt lajè, men lè yon machin pase bò kote ou, li pa santi lajè.
 Sa a trè, trè danjere.
 Sa a se pi gwo enkyetid mwen an.
 Li se yon lari okipe, Newton Street ak Grove Street.
 Sa a se yon entèseksyon trè okipe.
 Oswa kamyon an se nouvo epi li pare pou deplase bagay alantou.
 Moun vire la tout tan tout tan, ak chofè Uber vire kwen sa a tou.
 Mwen dakò sa a se yon vwayaj lokal.
 Mwen reyèlman panse ke yo ta dwe rekonsidere antre sa a nan yon fason gwo.
 Paske si yo repanse epi yo jwenn plis enfòmasyon, mwen vle di, tout moun ta konfonn pa atik sa a menm jan mwen te ye.
 Sa a ta dwe byen panse.
 Ta dwe gen plis kontribisyon paske sa se yon bagay lokal.
 Mwen di depanse lajan an.
 Lajan ki depanse kounye a pa gen anyen konpare ak sa ki te ka depanse, jis peni.
 Lè sa a, nan kou vini lajan an.
 Pase lajan w avèk sajès.
 Dènye fwa mwen tcheke, li pa t 'tan rapid.
 Se konsa, yon fwa ou mete l kanpe, li travay pou tout tan.
 Sa a se istorik.
 Se poutèt sa li enpòtan pou fè li byen.
 Se konsa, mwen te afekte dirèkteman tankou tout lòt moun.
 Nou tout te la pou yon ti tan.
 Nou tout mete anpil efò nan kay nou isit la e nou renmen li isit la.
 Se poutèt sa mwen rekòmande pou rekonsidere louvri yon biwo toupre kay John.
 John travay anpil nan kay la epi li pran swen byen li yo.
 Fè yon bagay sou bri a.
 Lè ou nan lakou ou, fondamantalman kèk ane de sa, anvan COVID, tout sa ou tande se otobis, tren,
 Gen yon avyon lè ou nan lakou ou.
 Se konsa, nenpòt bagay ki sèvi ak pye bwa ak touf kòm plant se gwo.
 Mwen vle di, se fondamantalman li, men vitès, tankou gan Newton ak Grove a, se faktè ki pi enpòtan pou mwen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6000.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Mèsi Bobby.
 Mèsi anpil.
 Mwen byen kontan nou tande kòmantè ou yo.
 Mèsi anpil.
 Alice, ou se pwochen.
 Tanpri bay non ak adrès ki anrejistre.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6009.428s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Wi, Elyse Jennings, 94 Grove Street, devan mi esklav la.
 Mèsi paske w te òganize reyinyon sa a epi w bay tout enfòmasyon yo.
 Mwen dakò ak anpil nan li.
 Plizyè sware apre travay la fin fè, mwen leve m panse ke te gen yon tranbleman tè.
 Men, mwen jis vle soulve yon pwen ki poko fèt.
 Oh, ak nan chemen an, mwen se yon pwopriyetè chen ak yon jèn pitit gason sou Grove Street.
 Men, mwen vle soulve pwoblèm nan pasaj pou pyeton yo.
 Oke, mwen konprann nesesite pou aksè ak li ta ka ede ralanti trafik.
 Mwen sèlman enkyete sou monstr ki gen twòp logo oswa limyè flache.
 Mwen pa konnen ki jan pasaj sa yo pral sanble.
 Mwen pa konnen konbyen nou vrèman bezwen.
 Se konsa, mwen jis te vle pote sa a paske mwen pa te tande pale de li anvan.
 Mwen te vle tou fè eko gaye mesaj la.
 Mwen tande yon vwazen te konnen mwen te abite isit la e li te di mwen sou sa, mwen gen chans konnen kèk nan vwazen yo paske mwen te isit la uit ane, men nou gen kèk vwazen nouvo ki pa sa ki konekte ankò.
 Kidonk, li ta bon si ou ta ka pi fasil jwenn enfòmasyon ke reyinyon sa yo ap pase ak plan sa yo ap fèt.
 Apre sa, kòmantè yon ti kras sou lè miray la esklav ak tout lòt mi yo te bati.
 Ankò, pale de bagay dezagreyab, nou te gen yon porta-potty devan nou.
 Machin yo ta sispann epi moun ta sèvi ak pot yo.
 Apre travay la te fini, li te rete la pou mwa, oswa omwen kèk semèn pita.
 Mwen pa konnen si pwochen travay mwen an pral gen ladan yon chodyè chanm, men jis nan ka
 Ploge li epi asire w ke li byen jere pou nou pa oblije rete la pi lontan pase èdtan travay.
 Wi, sa yo se jis kòmantè mwen te vle fè.
 Mèsi.
 Mèsi anpil.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6140.425s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: An reyalite, se la ke enfòmasyon reyinyon an te ekoute.
 Post, mèsi, se konsa mwen te dekouvri, mwen tap mache chen mwen ak yon moun kloure siy la la, donk mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6162.239s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Wi, mwen te jwenn tou soti nan yon vwazen, aktyèlman nan Diane, malerezman pa soti nan vil la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6171.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Èske w gen nenpòt lòt kòmantè anvan nou fini aswè a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6176.912s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Non, men mwen vle fè li klè ke si moun yo gen yon kote yo ale pou jwenn enfòmasyon, li se yon bon lide fè nou konnen lè ou imèl nou, pou egzanp, si ou gen yon kote yo ale, nou pral eseye jwe bò kote.
 Oke, ou konnen, kèk ane de sa te gen Yahoo chat fowòm ke tout moun te patisipe nan.
 Men, ou konnen, si yon sitiyasyon menm jan an rive kounye a, nou ta renmen eseye ogmante resous sa yo pou asire w ke nou itilize tout resous ki disponib pou nou.
 Jen, petèt nou ta ka eseye, ou konnen, si nou avanse ak travay la konsepsyon oswa yon bagay tankou sa, si nou te gen yon lòt sesyon, petèt ou ta ka pote moute yon bòdwo taks ki, ou konnen, ta gen yon enpak.
 Omwen kay la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6217.961s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Wi, mwen panse Dennis ak mwen te pale sou bòdwo dlo a.
 Li jis difisil.
 Menm jan ou gen pou jwenn imel ou dwat.
 Malerezman, nou pa t vrèman gen yon bidjè epi nou te oblije travay ak vil la pou eseye fè poste a.
 Se konsa, nou pral koute ou epi wè sa nou ka fè epi eseye fè li mache.
 Eseye kenbe l, ou konnen, petèt nou pral fè yon bagay sou li,
 Ou ka fè yon ti mache tou pre.
 Nou pral gen kèk panse epi nou vrèman apresye kòmantè tout moun aswè a.
 Ankò, si w gen nenpòt panse apre reyinyon sa a, tanpri voye yon imèl ba komite a.
 Sa a se sètènman pa nan fen pwosesis la.
 Sa a se kòmansman an oswa mitan an epi nou akeyi fidbak.
 Si w ta renmen rantre nan lis adrès nou an, tanpri voye lis adrès ou a epi n ap asire w ou sou lis nou an si w voye yon imèl ba nou.
 Nou toujou kontan aksepte kòmantè ak sijesyon.
 Se konsa, mèsi kòm toujou.
 Mèsi tout moun ki te vini aswè a.
 Mèsi paske w rete isit la pou plis pase 90 minit epi n wè pwochen fwa.
 Mèsi anpil.
 pase yon bon nwit.</p>
