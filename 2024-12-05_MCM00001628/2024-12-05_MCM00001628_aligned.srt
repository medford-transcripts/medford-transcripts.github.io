1
00:00:00,531 --> 00:00:08,037
Real quick, we are going to recap the overall master plan for the park that was developed back in 2020.

2
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:15,442
We will do a recap of the phase one work that has already been completed to date.

3
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:28,531
That includes Pomp's Wall restoration, the Fieldstone Wall restoration, and the archaeological dig, which I know some of you came to check out and participate in, so thank you for that.

4
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:33,414
we have what we're calling a new update to the master plan.

5
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:42,178
So from our archeological dig, we have been provided some recommendations to implement from that.

6
00:00:42,819 --> 00:00:48,221
And that's really kind of the crux of the presentation tonight that we wanted to share with the community.

7
00:00:48,822 --> 00:00:55,245
And that's really going to help build our pipeline for what we're calling phase three of the work in the park.

8
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:12,012
So we have done phase one, we are, in the next few months we'll be starting phase two, and then now we're kind of building the pipeline for phase three, which is what this, we're calling a history walk, some signage, some historic markers.

9
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:15,994
And again, these are just concepts that we're going to share with you tonight.

10
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:21,457
We don't have the funding yet for this phase, and we are still seeking community feedback.

11
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:33,985
But kind of in the vein of, you know, we're starting phase two, and we got to kind of look to the future for phase three, wanted to just kind of keep the ball rolling here on some of the things in the master plan.

12
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:47,898
And then we will circle back at the end to talk about phase two and the work that's forthcoming, which I know a lot of you probably are going to be excited about, that we have secured the funding for.

13
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:55,445
We are about to start sending out some RFPs to secure vendors, and that work is going to get slated to get done.

14
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,766
the early part of next year.

15
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:01,107
And then at the end, we'll have comments, questions, feedback.

16
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:13,210
We kindly ask that we get through the presentation before we take any questions or comments, and then everybody will have a chance to speak at the end on anything that you'd like at that point.

17
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:24,153
So from this point, I'm going to turn it over to Ryan Hayward and Peter Hedlund, who will be going over the crux of the presentation.

18
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,574
And guys, take it away.

19
00:02:29,076 --> 00:02:35,380
Thank you, Jen, for that introduction, and I think Ryan's going to get the.

20
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:38,158
Presentation up on the screen.

21
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:38,398
Great.

22
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:39,138
Thanks, Ryan.

23
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,319
So everybody should be looking at just the title slide here.

24
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,922
My name is Peter Headland, a landscape architect and a planner based in Arlington right next door.

25
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:57,445
I was fortunate enough to work on the master plan project and have now been doing a little study on this concept design.

26
00:02:57,505 --> 00:03:01,166
And we'll talk about that shortly here.

27
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:02,387
Okay, next slide.

28
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:07,734
Great.

29
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,975
The 2020 master plan, we started in 2019.

30
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:12,415
It was almost a year process.

31
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:13,096
It went through 2020.

32
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:22,038
And that's all on the historical commission website.

33
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:30,480
And at the end of that, we came up with a series of phased implementation projects that could happen over a period of

34
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,845
20 years, and we'll talk about the first phase of that with the next slide.

35
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:55,196
So this shows the first, say, seven of these implementation ideas that came out of the master plan, restoring the wall, the historic wall right on the edge of Grove Street.

36
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:00,341
an archaeological dig at the estate, which has also taken place.

37
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,702
We'll talk about that a little bit.

38
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:07,147
Making improvements to the Grove Street edge, the fieldstone wall there.

39
00:04:08,468 --> 00:04:12,332
Those were in phase one and we'll go over those in a little bit.

40
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,914
Other projects

41
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:31,997
from the master planning include new crosswalks, improvements to the trails, some type of signage to identify the park, and some planting in this central planted LA.

42
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,449
Okay, on the next slide, we'll talk about that.

43
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:43,970
The first step and really the reason for this whole park is what's now known as Pomp's Wall.

44
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:57,412
In 2019, the image on the upper left, that was the condition when we began the master plan and we had a historic masonry consultant, Richard Irons, come and maybe some of you heard him talk.

45
00:04:57,472 --> 00:05:00,913
He gave a presentation a number of years ago.

46
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,493
He evaluated the wall.

47
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:10,316
I wrote up a pretty detailed technical memo about the wall and went over some options to restore the wall.

48
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:27,884
Some of you might know that a wall that part of the, in the deed when this part was given to the city of Medford, it stipulated that this wall, they were so proud of this wall, that this wall needed to be forever maintained.

49
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:46,614
The preservation and restoration of this wall is really important or else technically, the old estate could take this part back over, but luckily, that's not going to happen.

50
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:55,420
The middle slide there shows the previous joint conditions, pretty deteriorated and the capstone needed some significant repair.

51
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,105
So, in the next slide, we show the process in 2023.

52
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:04,988
Mason was hired to do that work.

53
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,550
This is that restoration.

54
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,894
A lot of the wall really had to be taken apart and put back together.

55
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:12,255
And maybe some of you.

56
00:06:14,798 --> 00:06:17,983
were there or witnessed some of that progress.

57
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,647
And the brick on the right side is pretty interesting.

58
00:06:20,687 --> 00:06:26,616
The contractor pulled that out and you can see a fingerprints on the top of that brick.

59
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,079
So that's

60
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:38,786
Pretty interesting, the wall was said to have been built in 1760, and so those are over 250 years old.

61
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:43,688
Were they from Pompeii, the former enslaved person who built the wall?

62
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:55,054
Perhaps Medford was known for local brick making and these bricks were sourced locally, but that's really sort of a neat glimpse of history and all those bricks went back into that wall.

63
00:06:56,394 --> 00:07:08,701
On the next slide, you can see the final result from last year of the newly restored wall with newly pointed bricks.

64
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:14,644
They ended up putting a new cap on top of it to really seal that with flashing.

65
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:19,327
Hopefully, this will last for the next few generations.

66
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:31,479
Okay, so the next project that came out of the master plan in phase 1 was improving the Grove Street edge, the old field stone wall.

67
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,307
It's an interesting historic image on the right hand side of the screen here, which shows it's looking up Grove Street.

68
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:40,228
That is the

69
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:44,992
historic wall, formerly known as the slave wall, now known as Pompe's wall.

70
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:55,898
And you can see the wall as it was historically, but over time, it had sort of fallen apart in some areas more than others.

71
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:01,242
The image on the left here is showing prior to the master plan, you know, the

72
00:08:01,682 --> 00:08:09,584
wall in this area was pretty gone, and so the thought there was to improve this fieldstone wall.

73
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:14,385
And so the next slide shows the results of that.

74
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:19,226
With the wall repaired, it really helps to define the edge of the park.

75
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:29,869
Also, cutouts were left at intersections for crosswalks to access the park.

76
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,391
And...

77
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:45,330
Another part of that project was for five feet behind that wall, clearing out the understory, a lot of invasive plants have popped up in there.

78
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:54,676
Clearing that out a little bit, let these big trees, you can see this one over on the right side, give them a little bit more room to grow.

79
00:08:54,876 --> 00:09:01,660
Ryan, at the end, we'll talk a little bit about some upcoming planting maintenance improvements.

80
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:14,421
Okay, on the next slide, we talk about the third part of this first phase of projects coming out of the master plan, the archaeological dig at the estate.

81
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:23,450
Here we see illustration of the Thomas Brooks house that was right behind that wall.

82
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,813
This later colored here, that's that wall, that's Pomp's Wall.

83
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:34,236
You can see the drive right behind it and what this house looked like.

84
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:36,157
It was built in 1727.

85
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:37,938
The house was demolished in 1860.

86
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:46,243
Then it just really sat there because it was never redeveloped and became a park.

87
00:09:48,084 --> 00:10:00,933
The archaeologists we brought on for the master plan were determined, and they were correct, that this is a highly sensitive area for archaeological findings.

88
00:10:01,453 --> 00:10:05,997
And the master plan proposed an archaeological dig

89
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,328
with a professional and to work collaboratively with community volunteers, and that happened.

90
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:24,861
And they thought that there was the possibility to find, very good possibility to find both pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.

91
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:31,004
And on the next slide, we see that dig, which happened in 2022 and 23.

92
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:35,206
Maybe some people on this call, this Zoom meeting were part of that.

93
00:10:35,246 --> 00:10:40,067
You can see some of the people from the community along with the professionals working on that dig.

94
00:10:40,468 --> 00:10:45,269
There were 23 test pits and over 1,600 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.

95
00:10:52,612 --> 00:11:08,021
And post-contact and pre-contact mean either pre-contact is pre-colonial settlement and post-contact is after settlers arrived.

96
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:14,685
So there was both interesting findings from both of those areas, which is pretty neat.

97
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,427
And here's some of the things that were found.

98
00:11:17,487 --> 00:11:19,528
That piece of pottery was on that site.

99
00:11:20,652 --> 00:11:22,935
Okay, next slide please Ryan.

100
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:32,006
So there is a pretty detailed survey report from the master plan that made some recommendations.

101
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:38,474
They recommended to protect and preserve this site, specifically this estate site area.

102
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:51,984
They thought it was a highly sensitive area in and around the house site, and that in this area, that any below ground disturbance should be avoided or ideally kept at a real minimum.

103
00:11:52,565 --> 00:11:56,227
And that will come into play when we talk about the concept for this area.

104
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,410
Okay, the next slide, Ryan.

105
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:03,654
We see where that area is.

106
00:12:03,774 --> 00:12:06,375
This is the approximate house location.

107
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:10,077
We're looking south on the dirt path.

108
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:13,518
You can kind of see the back of Pomp's wall there.

109
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:16,760
So that's generally where that house was.

110
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,143
On the next slide, we have a couple images looking both south on that site.

111
00:12:24,123 --> 00:12:27,384
Some low vinca has grown up there.

112
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:28,225
Maybe,

113
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:35,531
A remnant from ground cover that was planted originally that could be possible.

114
00:12:35,631 --> 00:12:36,872
And then this is looking north.

115
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:45,359
It was a pretty open site originally around that estate, but trees have have grown in over time.

116
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,802
Okay, and the next slide.

117
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:54,338
We see a couple other just context views of the north entrance.

118
00:12:54,398 --> 00:13:03,164
This is the newly reconstructed wall and the break in the wall at the roadway opposite.

119
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:07,947
This is looking south on the south approach and you can see the open lawn there.

120
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:13,211
These are the two ways that visitors would get to this area.

121
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:15,212
Next slide.

122
00:13:17,478 --> 00:13:30,847
Okay, so we've been working for the last number of months and through a couple meetings on a design concept for this central area for this historically sensitive area, and I'll walk you through the main.

123
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:40,694
Concepts here, and with the 3 big ideas for the design concept to improve accessibility to the park.

124
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:50,708
And help identify the park as such as as a park and to make some of this really interesting history visible.

125
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:55,896
I remember when I first started working on the master plan, and I.

126
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:04,801
was out exploring the park, it's definitely not evident that it is or was a town-owned property.

127
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:09,385
And so the improvements to the walls certainly help.

128
00:14:10,926 --> 00:14:18,173
And some simple signage will help to identify it as an important historical park for the town of Medford.

129
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,875
So the first concept is a history wall.

130
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:34,455
which is a, these paths really sort of already exist, they're dirt pathways, mostly, and creating a loop here in this thicker orange line that would help to connect

131
00:14:35,937 --> 00:14:44,960
a number of these historically sensitive areas and use historic markers to interpret the history a little bit.

132
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,980
And we'll go through each of those.

133
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:52,282
But these blue circles are those 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 markers there.

134
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:56,663
Also, two potential areas for welcome signs to the park.

135
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:58,204
We'll talk about the

136
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:04,593
interpretation and stabilization measures around the former estate site.

137
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:11,843
And you have to be able to get to the park, so new crosswalks and accessible parking.

138
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:16,824
Okay, the next slide, Ryan, we'll kind of walk through each of these.

139
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:18,225
First is the history walk.

140
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:25,591
The walk, again, in this thicker orange here, it would be an accessible path in terms of slope and surfacing.

141
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:36,820
We haven't done a detailed, there hasn't been a detailed field survey done of this area of the park, but we think that it can be an accessible path below 5% slope.

142
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:50,131
And we'd like to connect that to new crosswalks so people from this community, or maybe who are parking there could get into this park.

143
00:15:52,013 --> 00:15:53,734
Okay, on the next slide.

144
00:15:55,478 --> 00:16:01,523
There are 2 potential areas for welcome signs, and Ryan will talk a little bit more about this at the end.

145
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:08,048
It would be great to identify the park, to name it, and to welcome visitors, to make them feel welcome.

146
00:16:08,108 --> 00:16:18,176
So here, opposite Jackson Road or potentially Ravine Road to the north are 2 potential areas for welcome signs.

147
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:20,858
Okay, on the next slide.

148
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:26,015
just a little bit history about Thomas Brooks Park.

149
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:32,576
This is 1860 Brooks estate plan, which was pretty big.

150
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:37,977
A lot of this land has since been given to the city of Medford.

151
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,138
Our little sliver right there is Thomas Brooks Park.

152
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:46,239
You can tell it's this almost like sharp triangle.

153
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:47,719
Up on the upper right is

154
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:49,339
at H.F.

155
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,539
Walling Plan from 1855.

156
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,320
And here we see our park there.

157
00:16:55,441 --> 00:17:01,022
It's easy to identify the railroad, which is this diagonal line, and then Grove Street.

158
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:06,463
And so that sliver right there is what the future park looked like in 1855.

159
00:17:06,563 --> 00:17:11,324
It is adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.

160
00:17:11,584 --> 00:17:15,705
And then the six-acre park was conveyed to the city in 1924, again, with the stipulation that the

161
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:24,549
brick wall, now known as Pomp's Wall, be forever maintained.

162
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,912
On the next slide, we talk about these historic markers.

163
00:17:30,992 --> 00:17:38,915
Originally, in earlier iteration, this walk was just a linear path from here to here.

164
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:45,999
But then as we took some feedback and evolved it a little bit, it's become more of a loop.

165
00:17:47,239 --> 00:17:50,321
Pomp's wall is right here just to orient everyone.

166
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:50,781
It's great.

167
00:17:51,381 --> 00:17:53,682
And Grove Street is right here.

168
00:17:54,162 --> 00:18:05,188
So the proposal is to have a series of five simple historic markers so that visitors to the site would help to understand the rich history here a little bit better.

169
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,609
Both the Native American history,

170
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:17,908
which marker could be there, the African American history with this pretty remarkable wall, Pomp's Wall, that's just been restored.

171
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:24,755
There's a pretty fascinating history of water systems and the Middlesex Canal here, and

172
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:35,142
This is an appropriate place for that historic marker because it looks out over this lawn.

173
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,622
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

174
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:45,067
And then on the back of the park here, you're right next to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, now known as the MBTA Lowell Branch Railroad.

175
00:18:47,648 --> 00:19:01,730
which also has a rich history, and then coming around to the colonial American history of the site and the sort of remains of the Thomas Brooke estate and thinking about how to interpret and mark that.

176
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:09,772
Okay, so over the next handful of slides, we move to the next one, we'll talk about how to do that and why that's important.

177
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:15,993
So the Native American historic marker, again, with the archaic,

178
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:19,714
I have a hard time saying that word today.

179
00:19:20,055 --> 00:19:32,180
With the dig that was just done, there were 64 pre-contact artifacts found collected during the 22-23 dig, which is pretty neat.

180
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,202
Maybe some community members on this call or in this picture, I don't know.

181
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:43,185
Largely, the items that were found were chipping debris and pottery shards.

182
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:50,608
presumably from the middle to late Woodlands period, 2000 to 450 years ago.

183
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:53,589
So pretty significant historical resource.

184
00:19:53,729 --> 00:20:05,293
And this has a potential for rich Native American history, given the proximity of water resources and the

185
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:06,934
topography.

186
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:14,263
So that's pretty invisible now, but it'd be great to make that history a little bit more visible, just with a simple interpretive marker.

187
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:18,728
Okay, and on the next slide, we talk about Pomp's Wall.

188
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:22,212
Okay, the existing marker, which is there, if you want to

189
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:32,195
Sneak on the edge of the roadway and or peek at it from your car is shown on the upper right there.

190
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:40,997
This upper left is a historic photo, which the date is unknown of, and the photo in the middle is from 1899.

191
00:20:41,377 --> 00:20:43,698
So you can look up Grove Street.

192
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:51,087
You can see the wall, it's beginning to get overgrown there, but pretty open behind it, some of the big trees there.

193
00:20:51,548 --> 00:21:00,239
We know the wall was constructed around 1760, that the city is required to preserve and forever maintain it in that deed.

194
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,862
to the city, it stipulates that.

195
00:21:03,743 --> 00:21:08,489
And then there was this recent, very important restoration and renaming of the wall.

196
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:14,375
So that's an important history to help make visible.

197
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:28,367
Okay, if we go to the next slide, we can help to mark in a way the importance of the Medford water systems.

198
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:33,411
This picture on the left is a little hard to see.

199
00:21:33,512 --> 00:21:35,493
All these slides will be posted on the

200
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:38,076
Historical Commission website.

201
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:45,904
And if you look on there, there's a lot of information from the past number of years from all the studies and meetings that were done.

202
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:52,251
This is a plaque elsewhere in Medford that shows the Middlesex Canal and the route.

203
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,474
Our little park

204
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,375
is right here.

205
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:59,536
You can see the railroad and Grove Street.

206
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:04,719
And so this Middlesex Canal was right to the south of this area.

207
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,723
The Middlesex Canal was around from 1793 to 1853, ran from Charlestown to Lowell.

208
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:16,325
It was partly financed by the Brooks family, which has such a prominent role.

209
00:22:16,945 --> 00:22:18,326
in the city of Medford.

210
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:23,027
It supplied much of the lumber for shipbuilding in Medford.

211
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:25,428
That was such a big industry in the city.

212
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:30,629
On the lower right is an image of one of the bridges.

213
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:32,430
There were a number of

214
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,600
bridges, 50 bridges, all along the canal.

215
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,801
And this was one in Medford that was taken down.

216
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:53,243
But we think that some of these blocks were used in this Grove Street field stone wall, especially south of Pomp's Wall.

217
00:22:53,303 --> 00:22:56,324
You can go look and the stones there are more cut in.

218
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:03,606
rectilinear blocks.

219
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:22,931
I can't get into a lot of it here, but there's really a fascinating study that the head of the MWRA did on the role of Medford in the whole water and sewer development for the city of Boston in the nearby area.

220
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:24,492
It's pretty fascinating.

221
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:37,194
area where we're proposing this historic marker looking out on that field, well part of the reason the field is there and it's not overgrown is because there's a sewer easement that actually runs through there.

222
00:23:38,274 --> 00:23:50,157
And so there's a lot of interesting things to talk about for a potential historic marker talking about these water systems and the task will be how to distill this information in a concise way.

223
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:50,437
Okay.

224
00:23:53,542 --> 00:24:09,001
If we go to the next slide, I talked a little bit about the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the proposals for historic marker on the backside of Thomas Brooks Park, talking about this, that this railroad was constructed in 1835.

225
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:09,121
Also,

226
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:25,385
partly financed by the Brooks family, the people didn't really want the railroad to happen, especially the people who were invested in the canal because the railroad made the canal not as necessary.

227
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:29,767
And it essentially replaced the canal in order to speed up.

228
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:37,793
Transportation provide year-round freight transportation because the canal would freeze in the winter.

229
00:24:38,414 --> 00:24:47,460
This railroad, it was the first major railroad in the state, one of the first in the whole Northeast, and it's still used today.

230
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,383
It's an active rail line as the MBTA Lowell line.

231
00:24:52,664 --> 00:24:55,546
That's an image on the bottom right.

232
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:57,047
You can see Boston and Lowell there.

233
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:11,835
Okay, and Ryan, if you go to the next slide, the last historic marker kind of gets back to what we started with, with the dig on the site.

234
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:23,080
Now, this is an image of the Brooks Estate House, and the historic marker would help to reinterpret that or interpret that history.

235
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:32,504
that this house was built in 1727, you can see here there was a little curved driveway behind that brick wall.

236
00:25:32,784 --> 00:25:41,196
And that's essentially where, if you walk out there, where that dirt footpath is and where that history walk would be.

237
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:47,978
Then you can see the brick wall between the street and the driveway, that's the palms wall.

238
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:53,280
We know historically it was noted that there were three black walnut trees in front of the house.

239
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,981
You can see them in this illustration and also those original trees aren't there.

240
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:06,583
But if you're out there in that park, there are black walnut trees that are descendants, I think, of these original trees.

241
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:10,224
Then as we know, there are a lot of artifacts recovered.

242
00:26:12,024 --> 00:26:17,847
from the dig over 1600 from the post-contact or colonial era.

243
00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:26,012
Okay, on the next slide, we looked at this site.

244
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:38,439
This is the general area of that estate house, and the proposal is to both protect and preserve and interpret this site a little bit by marking the

245
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:49,365
Corners of where the house was with simple stone blocks and stabilizing the surface with low plantings.

246
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:56,369
And then this would be the blue circle that historic marker, which would be able to interpret it.

247
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:58,470
So, if you go to the next slide.

248
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:05,736
This was one of the site precedents that we looked at, Robbins Farm Park.

249
00:27:05,776 --> 00:27:11,922
It's a neat park right next door to Medford, up on the top of the hill.

250
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:14,745
There's an old farm there.

251
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:23,053
It was given to the city, turned into a park, and maybe probably 10 years or so ago,

252
00:27:23,854 --> 00:27:30,296
Park and Recreation Commission wanted to sort of memorialize the house in the former farm there.

253
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:35,278
And so they put, they marked the foundation here with these stone blocks.

254
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:39,960
These are kind of similar to what we're thinking for Thomas Brooks Park.

255
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,941
And they had a simple sign in their case, it was right on the block.

256
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:48,603
In our case, maybe it would be a separate standing element as a way to

257
00:27:49,784 --> 00:27:56,119
Talk about the former farmhouse that was there and give people a sense of that history a little bit.

258
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:09,806
Okay, on the next slide we have another site that's interpreted the historic history, tracing the foundations of historic house.

259
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:21,411
This is the Governor Winthrop House in Charleston, the great house site where they used found stones and some foundation stones and brought those to the surface and

260
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:34,416
Trace that foundation there and then just a simple lawn is a very different setting their more urban area and more extensive historic sign that you can see on the bottom right.

261
00:28:34,436 --> 00:28:37,417
Okay, on the next slide.

262
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:44,780
We also would like to stabilize the surface in a very simple way with ground cover planting.

263
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:52,024
There's already a little bit of that there with a vinca that's taken over, naturalized the site a little bit.

264
00:28:52,504 --> 00:28:57,807
And on the next slide, we'd like to add to that a little bit with a nice native plant, gold star.

265
00:28:58,827 --> 00:29:08,912
It's native, shade-tolerant, a lot of trees around, pretty low, 6-12 inches tall, and has a nice bloom from the late spring into the fall.

266
00:29:08,952 --> 00:29:27,021
You can imagine walking on this path and coming across these blocks and a little burst of flowers might be a pretty elegant, beautiful, but yet subtle way to think about this site.

267
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:37,847
On the next slide, we talked about another way that we could use plants to bring back the history.

268
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:45,831
This is Syringa vulgaris, a common lilac, which is for hundreds of years been part of New England's horticultural heritage.

269
00:29:46,371 --> 00:29:48,372
And the quote on the bottom here is from the

270
00:29:49,833 --> 00:30:10,058
Medford paper in 1912, that some of the historic research which the state did, which predated the master plan, they pulled together, and I'll just read the quote, beside the street, Grove Street, and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed and bordered with a row of lilacs.

271
00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:17,584
So they're talking about Palm's Wall and they're talking about Grove Street, which by the looks of this was originally bordered with lilac.

272
00:30:17,624 --> 00:30:23,770
So wouldn't it be neat, the upper right image is of the Arnold Arboretum on Lilac Sunday.

273
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:28,094
Pro tip, that's a great place to go.

274
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:29,095
Amazingly,

275
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:35,662
blooms in the middle of May.

276
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:39,228
We'd like to bring those lilacs back at the wall.

277
00:30:39,408 --> 00:30:42,853
On the next slide, we can see a picture of the wall.

278
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,585
This is looking right up Grove Street and Palm's wall over on the right hand side with a field stone wall next to it.

279
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:56,870
And on the next slide, just a little illustration of what some lilacs would look like right behind that wall.

280
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:03,775
It would look pretty nice for vehicles or people on the sidewalk over on the other side here.

281
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,979
It's a nice southern orientation there, southwest orientation.

282
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:10,682
So I think those lilacs would do well.

283
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:22,795
And at the same time, we could plant some, just a low ground cover on the roadside to help stabilize that embankment there.

284
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:39,105
Okay, and on the next slide, we have a look at the existing conditions behind Pompe's wall and up that path so this would be the history walk and then the next slide shows a little illustration of

285
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:57,241
what that might look like with some lilacs over on the side in this simple walkway that would then loop around with a series of historic markers and then the stone blocks at the estate house to give a deeper understanding of the rich history of this site.

286
00:31:59,423 --> 00:32:16,548
Okay, on the next slide, I believe we're hopping into some information Ryan from the historical commission can share on the upcoming improvements for the second phase at the park.

287
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:19,429
Thank you, Peter.

288
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:28,755
All right, so now I just want to very quickly dig into the phase 2 construction update.

289
00:32:28,835 --> 00:32:40,344
So just to reiterate what Jen said at the beginning, we have a master plan from 2020, but the document is a living document subject to change.

290
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:42,605
it's gonna evolve.

291
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:52,272
So whatever's in the master plan, some of you I'm sure have read it, the phasing that we're using is different than the phasing that it's called out for in construction.

292
00:32:52,392 --> 00:33:09,184
So for this phase of funding, which has been fully funded thanks to a generous grant from the Community Preservation Commission, we're looking to do a larger archeological dig, we're looking to do some tree trimming and deadwood removal, the required American with Disabilities Act,

293
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:13,810
architectural access for curb cuts, the sidewalk and their parking space.

294
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:24,202
We're looking to identify crosswalks by striping them and having some signage put up and then of course we're looking to identify this location as a public park.

295
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:28,715
There are some things that are being considered.

296
00:33:28,796 --> 00:33:37,101
We are looking at, of course, this archaeological cap that Peter just talked about that is in the early, early, early planning phases.

297
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:48,890
And of course, we're considering things like improving trail definition, adding appropriate trees to the site, and some underbrush thinning and invasive cuttings as we plant trees.

298
00:33:49,571 --> 00:34:02,104
But of course, what is not being considered, we heard you way back when we had the public meeting and we've heard you along at this point, even though it's in the master plan, we're not considering at all the community garden or the railroad bridge.

299
00:34:02,244 --> 00:34:10,052
So I'll just get that out of the way so that folks know that what we're considering is low impact stuff still to the park, okay?

300
00:34:12,238 --> 00:34:25,107
So for the archaeology, we are looking to hire an archaeologist to explore the Thomas Brooks House site and the people that live there, both the Brooks family and their indentured servants.

301
00:34:25,548 --> 00:34:28,850
It's a little known topic that's been explored.

302
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:34,955
The site has a lot of ties to slavery in New England, so it's a really important location.

303
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:37,917
So prior to doing any sort of cap that

304
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:43,460
permanently protects the site, we wanna finish up the archeological due diligence on this.

305
00:34:43,661 --> 00:34:54,448
And we'll be looking for community volunteers, just like the previous time, we can have people help us out with the soil sifting and lab work for the artifacts so people could see it.

306
00:34:55,269 --> 00:34:57,250
So we certainly will reach out for that.

307
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:06,817
And what will conclude our work with the archeology portion of it will be the cap that we're hoping to install between

308
00:35:07,377 --> 00:35:17,799
you know, Peter's history walk and the house interpretation and interpretive panels and all that to protect this site from any sort of negative impact.

309
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:24,246
There is a lot of tree trimming that needs to get done.

310
00:35:24,386 --> 00:35:36,079
So for this we are looking at the most immediate concerns which relate to the 50 or so 150 year old trees that are on this site.

311
00:35:38,141 --> 00:35:43,045
Of them, there are 30 historic trees that are in relatively good condition.

312
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:54,333
They need pruning, like pruning light, and just to remove there, some deadwood branches, some leaders have split off, but there are 10

313
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,737
trees in and around the park that are completely dead.

314
00:35:58,837 --> 00:36:07,466
You can see on the right here this image where their leaders have split entirely and there's nothing left and those trees need to be removed for public safety.

315
00:36:07,886 --> 00:36:14,814
Other ones like the image on the far left you can see that the leader has split off and it's hanging precariously over some of the trails.

316
00:36:14,914 --> 00:36:15,674
So we're looking to

317
00:36:17,356 --> 00:36:21,139
trim all of those so that the park is safe from one end to the other.

318
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,702
And there are two invasive Norway maples that are completely dead.

319
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:27,563
They tower over the site.

320
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:31,385
They're about 20 feet tall, but they're only about 15 years old.

321
00:36:32,386 --> 00:36:41,852
Those we're hoping to have removed because they are, any tree that's that size is a nuisance and it's overlooking the MBTA's right of way.

322
00:36:42,673 --> 00:36:44,614
But with all of that tree trimming,

323
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:47,415
we're hoping to plant 15 new trees.

324
00:36:47,495 --> 00:37:14,510
And I say oak trees, but in talking with the City Tree Warden, it could be an oak tree, it could be sugar maples, trees that are native to New England and native to this site that we want to replace the invasive Norway maples that are here and have a plan to continue to plant trees that will be curated, so to speak, so that the park becomes like a park and maintains that wooded feeling.

325
00:37:16,447 --> 00:37:23,111
Now, as part of this project, one of the big key pieces is that we are looking to remove all of the deadwood throughout the site.

326
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:30,415
So we know there were some pieces of deadwood that were taken off of the street when the ice storm happened on Grove Street.

327
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:32,256
The DPW has been chipping away at that.

328
00:37:32,376 --> 00:37:33,597
We're going to complete that work.

329
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:38,920
And then, of course, there were several trees that were taken down during the wall for public safety.

330
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,581
All of those are going to be removed.

331
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:50,207
And then all of the miscellaneous tree droppings that have come from the historic trees that are dying or are dead will all be removed from one end of the park to the other.

332
00:37:51,048 --> 00:37:53,549
So it'll be a total top to bottom clean out.

333
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,112
A lot of that material, if it's too big, it will be taken off site.

334
00:37:58,252 --> 00:37:59,353
If it's smaller,

335
00:37:59,813 --> 00:38:06,618
and can be shredded, we'll put some of that back on the path so that there will be some definition to the paths.

336
00:38:10,397 --> 00:38:15,301
For accessibility improvements, we have a number of those up and down the park.

337
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:26,050
The big one is that we are going to reconnect the sidewalk along the east side of Grove Street that currently is dead-ended at Newton Street down to the new entrance at Jackson Road.

338
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,573
We'll put curb cuts at all of the wall openings.

339
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:34,757
There will be striped walkways at Jackson Road, Gravine Road, and Layard Road.

340
00:38:36,137 --> 00:38:37,898
There'll be crosswalk signage.

341
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:42,859
And of course, all of this is gonna take a lot of time because there's many key players.

342
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:56,683
So we're exploring it and we're working on designs and concepts, but the city department of public works, traffic department, all of them have to come into play as we start to move forward with this project.

343
00:38:56,723 --> 00:39:02,365
So we're just getting underway and they're many, many months out.

344
00:39:03,086 --> 00:39:20,907
but we're hoping to get off the ground with construction maybe spring of 2025 so that we can basically start the year off right and at first possible period of construction after the winter we'll get in the ground and deliver on these things that we've been working on for over a year.

345
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:34,077
For the space, they will need to be striped somewhere nearby as part of the accessible route and accessible path around the park, a single parking space.

346
00:39:34,678 --> 00:39:39,583
When we were originally developing the master plan, it was asked that we keep cars out of the park.

347
00:39:40,303 --> 00:39:44,545
So we do have to provide a ADA accessible space somewhere.

348
00:39:45,405 --> 00:39:54,228
We will work with the residents, you guys, all to try to locate that in a location that's convenient for both the accessible route and the residents.

349
00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:59,030
But it also requires that the city hold a public hearing with the traffic department.

350
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,952
So there'll be many, many more opportunities to engage with where and how this space fits on.

351
00:40:05,673 --> 00:40:06,093
And of course,

352
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:07,993
Thoughts have changed.

353
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:09,514
There is access.

354
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:13,235
It's not preferred, but we could put the parking space on the site again if needed.

355
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:19,537
For striping of sidewalks, we do want to just keep it simple.

356
00:40:20,397 --> 00:40:24,499
You know, just a simple painted sidewalk will suffice.

357
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,419
Signage at a minimum.

358
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,080
We talked with traffic department the other day.

359
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:35,262
The preference maybe for a lighted sign, if at all, would be Jackson Road.

360
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:44,831
where there's a high concentration of people crossing for the main entrance of the park, maybe even a safe route for residents going to and from school.

361
00:40:45,712 --> 00:40:50,657
But depending on what we hear back for feedback, that's subject to discussion.

362
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:56,764
And then park signage, we, there's two different types of park signage.

363
00:40:56,784 --> 00:41:01,449
So there's the signage that welcomes people to the history walk and the interpretive signage.

364
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,574
But really, for this phase, we're looking to identify the park as a park.

365
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:09,719
And we're hoping to have something similar to the Brooks Estate sign just up the street.

366
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,221
This site does relate to the

367
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:16,486
Brooks Estate property, but it can have its own identity.

368
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:31,598
So we don't have yet a true design, but something that identifies this as a city park with some history so that everybody knows that it's not just a derelict piece of woodland, that it really is a location that is important to Medford.

369
00:41:34,622 --> 00:41:40,886
And then, of course, with ongoing planning, there's things that we're looking at as part of this project that will lead into other projects.

370
00:41:41,627 --> 00:41:43,528
We have historic tree work.

371
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:51,553
At some point, there's an alley of oak trees and black walnut trees that we'd like to open up and.

372
00:41:52,253 --> 00:41:55,254
maybe thin out some of the invasive Norway maples.

373
00:41:55,894 --> 00:42:02,556
But we are listening and we do understand that currently the vegetation acts as a sort of sound screen.

374
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:13,200
So as part of that, we would talk about maybe planting some trees so that those larger and more appropriate trees can come up in size while the existing landscape is then thinned out.

375
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,401
And so that sound buffer is always maintained.

376
00:42:17,141 --> 00:42:22,224
But again, that's a later phase, many, many, many, many phases out.

377
00:42:22,884 --> 00:42:30,548
But the big one is some of the tree work that's being done will alleviate the damage to the MBTA's fence.

378
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:38,773
So we'll get the MBTA to work with us to repair their fence so that the park will be safe, so that nobody can cut through the rail bed when all is said and done.

379
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:46,504
And so that's the crux of what we're doing for phase two.

380
00:42:47,344 --> 00:42:50,066
So we know that you guys have comments and questions.

381
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:56,750
So I think if you'd like to make a comment or have some questions for us, we're happy to take them.

382
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,891
We just ask that people raise their hand.

383
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:02,754
And of course, you know, not all the comments need to be made tonight.

384
00:43:02,774 --> 00:43:04,075
It's not the be all end all.

385
00:43:04,815 --> 00:43:08,998
We're going to try to work forward with the archaeological field work, which doesn't

386
00:43:09,218 --> 00:43:35,017
any impact on the park other than digging and excavating and then capping and then some of the tree work to for safety purposes but the rest of the stuff again six months out to finalize design so we'll be taking comments and we're happy to have emails if you know stuff comes up later and if you guys want to take some time to digest what you've heard this evening and and put it in

387
00:43:35,817 --> 00:43:45,584
And of course, as I said at the beginning of the meeting, if we don't have your email, if you're not on our contact list, just shoot us an email and we're happy to add you to our mailings and publicity.

388
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,347
Thank you, Ryan.

389
00:43:50,387 --> 00:43:51,048
Thank you, Peter.

390
00:43:51,068 --> 00:43:56,392
And as Ryan said, I'm happy to open the floor for comments or questions at this point.

391
00:43:56,492 --> 00:44:02,416
If anybody has anything, if you'd like to raise your hand, I will unmute you and call on you.

392
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:07,873
Tamara, if you'd like to unmute yourself.

393
00:44:08,393 --> 00:44:10,754
Nick, can we get your address for the record, please?

394
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:11,375
Yes.

395
00:44:12,396 --> 00:44:16,738
14 Newton Road in West Medford on the south side of the Thomas Brook Park.

396
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:30,027
Very briefly, I just want to say thank you to everyone for your thoughtfulness, for your listening to the community, for your attempts and hard work to preserve what is historical and endemic to this area.

397
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,208
I just want to say thank you.

398
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,450
Obviously, your presentation put in a lot of hard work.

399
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:40,994
You're clearly listening to the community and I love what you're doing and really appreciate it.

400
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:42,315
So thank you so much for all your hard work.

401
00:44:43,696 --> 00:44:44,636
Thank you so much.

402
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:48,198
Dave, I see your hand if you'd like to unmute yourself.

403
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:50,200
Can we get your name and address for the record, please?

404
00:44:51,141 --> 00:44:53,022
So my question is, is, has there been any consideration to get.

405
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:21,100
What is and has been happening for well before we lived here, people who go to the park just cut through there and the wall is not completed on our side.

406
00:45:21,161 --> 00:45:25,304
So that is a bit of an annoyance for us living here.

407
00:45:25,324 --> 00:45:30,009
A lot of people just cut through the lawn, cut over the lawn, cut through the driveway.

408
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:48,599
And my thinking is that if that part of the wall is not completed, people from our side of the street down to High Street, everyone who are on that area, are going to still continue to cut through over our property and cut through into the Brooks Estate that way.

409
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:54,522
And less people are going to utilize all the goals that you guys have with the different

410
00:45:55,283 --> 00:45:58,088
Um, you know, placements and the walkways and everything else.

411
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:05,883
So I don't know if there's has there been any talks of finishing that portion of the wall on our side of where we live.

412
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:10,265
So I can make a comment and then Ryan probably want to jump in as well.

413
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:13,486
So we've heard a lot of comments about that end of the wall.

414
00:46:14,267 --> 00:46:25,152
And for exactly the reason you're talking about, which was why it was kind of closed off on that spot, because folks were crossing over private property to get into the park.

415
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:37,558
And so for that reason and the sight lines from a traffic perspective was why the opening was moved up so that there is an easier way to cross the street.

416
00:46:37,858 --> 00:46:41,640
Now, we know it's not ideal to have to zigzag back and forth across.

417
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:52,946
And that's why in this next phase, we will be extending the sidewalk on the same side of the street to the opening that is now there so that people don't have to crisscross back and forth

418
00:46:53,366 --> 00:47:00,830
nor do they have to cross over your driveway, Dave, and into your property to get into the grassy area of the park.

419
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:18,160
So we are working on it, and we understand and we hear the frustrations from the folks at the lower end of Grove Street and on those side streets, and we are trying to make it easier for folks on that side of the street to not have to cross the street twice.

420
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,141
And Ryan, feel free to jump in.

421
00:47:21,618 --> 00:47:25,819
Yeah, I just, you know, we definitely want to put in that sidewalk.

422
00:47:25,919 --> 00:47:33,420
We deliberately left the wall back five feet just to make sure that there was room to put in a sidewalk.

423
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,481
And there'll be, you know, there's a tree on that side that the wall kind of curves around, so that will be gone.

424
00:47:39,121 --> 00:47:45,462
And I think there's one sign for the speed hump that will have to be adjusted.

425
00:47:45,582 --> 00:47:50,503
But then there'll be a nice welcoming sidewalk all the way down to the main entrance.

426
00:47:51,223 --> 00:48:14,255
it will be clear that, you know, if with some signage in the crosswalk and, you know, if we put up some lighted signage, so to speak, so that people know in the evenings or during dim lighting that it is a crosswalk, it'll become more evident to come down to the main entrance of the park and stop there.

427
00:48:14,275 --> 00:48:15,516
You know, currently it's,

428
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:24,458
It's a desire path, but if we give people an alternative that's clean and maintained, it will slowly work itself out.

429
00:48:24,518 --> 00:48:33,620
Just like at the opposite end of the park, we closed the other end at the Grove Street Railroad Bridge for public safety as well.

430
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:42,421
And again, residents were climbing over the wall because people had been doing it, but it seems to have worked itself out.

431
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:45,182
So we think over time, it too will

432
00:48:45,662 --> 00:48:46,563
work itself out.

433
00:48:50,426 --> 00:48:51,667
Zoe, I see your hand.

434
00:48:51,707 --> 00:48:54,549
If you could give us your name and address on the record, please.

435
00:48:54,809 --> 00:48:54,969
Yep.

436
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:57,851
I'm Zoe Moutsos from 33 Johnson Ave.

437
00:48:57,891 --> 00:48:58,332
Hi, Dave.

438
00:48:58,452 --> 00:48:59,112
Neighbor of Dave.

439
00:48:59,232 --> 00:49:04,816
And I'm a scofflaw who walks around his property to get into the park.

440
00:49:05,037 --> 00:49:10,020
I do want to speak about the folks who are on our island of Tyler and Johnson Ave.

441
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:12,322
and this is why we do this.

442
00:49:12,522 --> 00:49:18,706
In the original plan that I saw, there was an entrance at Newton Road, and that would have been great.

443
00:49:18,906 --> 00:49:27,891
I don't know why that was removed or why it didn't happen, but we live in a part of Medford that just doesn't have easy access to green space.

444
00:49:28,572 --> 00:49:32,895
Our kids have to cross multiple busy, scary streets

445
00:49:33,715 --> 00:49:39,637
To get to play said we're crossing literally a railroad track and play said road right to get to this little park.

446
00:49:40,058 --> 00:49:44,619
We're crossing, you know, unless we can walk down grocery and get into the park.

447
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,881
You know, we're crossing Grove street, which is like a highway.

448
00:49:47,961 --> 00:49:49,601
So I think this is why the.

449
00:49:51,022 --> 00:50:03,007
This is why the, I forget what the language Ryan used was, this is why people are walking that way, and this is why we were so disappointed when the plan wasn't followed and that was closed off.

450
00:50:03,427 --> 00:50:14,372
I think we could have done something there to take some of those trees down and let people come in and not be walking through Dave's property, because I understand that is, that's not,

451
00:50:15,092 --> 00:50:31,285
Appropriate is not ideal, but what you've left us is the choice of running across traffic with kids and dogs in the dark that's not well lit, walking on a path that is, I would be doubtful that that path is wide enough to be even ADA compliant for streets.

452
00:50:31,525 --> 00:50:33,006
I can't imagine that it is.

453
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:37,089
And right now it's bumpy, it's glass filled, it's just really,

454
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:53,640
So much of that park is so beautiful, and I know it's going to be wonderful when it's done, but it's a great disappointment to at least me on Johnson Ave, and I know other folks in the area that essentially, again, we're trapped in a highway of streets where people speed.

455
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,304
And we can't get to the closest green space that we have.

456
00:50:57,684 --> 00:51:04,893
So I would really just, I guess my point is, maybe we could consider putting that Newton Road in that was supposed to be in there.

457
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:09,779
And also, separately from all of my rant on that, thank you for listening to me.

458
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:13,779
There are tons of invasives in that park.

459
00:51:14,259 --> 00:51:22,841
There's black swallow wart, there's garlic mustard, there's poison ivy, like it needs to, like the invasives are not just the Norways, right?

460
00:51:22,861 --> 00:51:28,763
So I wonder when folks are in there, is there a plan to kind of handle those invasives?

461
00:51:28,843 --> 00:51:33,625
Because my goodness, the garlic mustard over the last two years, if you're in sort of the,

462
00:51:34,345 --> 00:51:35,226
clearing of the park.

463
00:51:35,246 --> 00:51:36,266
I don't know what we talked about.

464
00:51:36,286 --> 00:51:48,675
We didn't really pay a lot of attention to that area in this presentation, but the clear area that's right by Newton Road, if you look in, it's almost all garlic mustard and black swallow wart now.

465
00:51:49,175 --> 00:51:50,856
That's only going to continue to get worse.

466
00:51:51,156 --> 00:51:51,917
Anyway, thank you.

467
00:51:51,957 --> 00:52:01,503
I know it's going to be great, but I would really just love some real thought around the safe entrance and just the fact that Grove Street is really dangerous.

468
00:52:01,563 --> 00:52:03,405
People drive really fast on that road.

469
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:04,457
Thank you.

470
00:52:05,498 --> 00:52:06,259
Thank you, Zoe.

471
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:10,182
And I live on Grove Street as well, so I completely hear you.

472
00:52:11,443 --> 00:52:19,649
I'd like to just go to John Ardizzone, because I see your hand up, and I saw it up before, and I know that you're not using the hand on Zoom.

473
00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:22,471
So I just wanted to save you the holding your hand up.

474
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:27,155
So John, if you'd like to unmute yourself, and if we could get your name and address for the record, please.

475
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:32,848
John art is only lived on 53 Johnson Avenue for 30 years.

476
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:35,736
So I know all the history of this park.

477
00:52:36,905 --> 00:52:39,106
and I own 69 Grove Street.

478
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:40,487
My tenant is David.

479
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:44,808
People walk down my driveway into the park there, they shouldn't be.

480
00:52:45,849 --> 00:52:47,049
It was supposed to be blocked off.

481
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:48,050
That's only one issue.

482
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:58,414
The other issue is this whole process of making so much, there's so much traffic on this street and you're just putting more and more traffic in it.

483
00:52:58,834 --> 00:53:01,655
The other thing is we're talking about people bringing their kids.

484
00:53:02,135 --> 00:53:03,476
It's strictly a dog park.

485
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:08,424
I'm one of the, I've been here longer than anybody in this picture here.

486
00:53:08,944 --> 00:53:11,526
Peter, Ryan, any of these people have come on.

487
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:12,927
They haven't been there as long as I have.

488
00:53:13,828 --> 00:53:18,112
I was there when it was a victory garden, when they used to have community gardens there.

489
00:53:18,672 --> 00:53:19,433
It was beautiful.

490
00:53:20,073 --> 00:53:26,901
You're talking about when they built the wall, they destroyed all the plants that were behind those walls and all the trees.

491
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:33,308
The guys who did the wall were supposed to put it up gently like they did in the upper part of grocery.

492
00:53:33,568 --> 00:53:35,230
These guys just mowed it down.

493
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,731
They made piles of rock.

494
00:53:37,592 --> 00:53:40,673
Then the other thing is you're talking about your sight being so sensitive.

495
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:49,495
They took in five, ten wheels of three quarter inch stone over my driveway, cracked my driveway, and dumped them in the field.

496
00:53:50,035 --> 00:53:50,335
Okay?

497
00:53:50,655 --> 00:53:54,537
That stone was supposed to be used for the base of that beautiful wall that they built.

498
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:56,257
They never used any of the stone.

499
00:53:56,517 --> 00:53:59,858
When they were all done, they came in with a backhoe and they leveled the thing.

500
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:01,833
I work in the area.

501
00:54:02,013 --> 00:54:04,335
I've worked in the area for 30 years.

502
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:05,796
I know the history of this.

503
00:54:06,196 --> 00:54:10,139
You're talking about canals and you talk about archaeological digs.

504
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:14,922
The town, the city has been mowing grass in there and tearing the place up for years.

505
00:54:14,942 --> 00:54:17,344
It used to be very quiet along Grove Street.

506
00:54:17,804 --> 00:54:22,468
Now all you do is hear the trains because you removed all the junk around those rocks.

507
00:54:23,148 --> 00:54:29,774
You got they literally came in and mowed down 20 feet behind that wall, knock every wall out of there.

508
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:31,355
They didn't start that way.

509
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,237
When they started the bridge, they did a nice and neat.

510
00:54:33,497 --> 00:54:35,078
They even use stone in the beginning.

511
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:36,359
I'm in the construction business.

512
00:54:36,399 --> 00:54:36,940
I know this.

513
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,943
When they got about third of the way down there, forget the stone.

514
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:42,905
Forget going around trees.

515
00:54:43,165 --> 00:54:44,406
They just mowed everything down.

516
00:54:45,106 --> 00:54:46,428
Now it's a mess in back there.

517
00:54:46,788 --> 00:54:49,190
What you should have done is you should just clean the park.

518
00:54:50,753 --> 00:54:54,198
The noise, the drinking, you want to take people's pocket.

519
00:54:54,218 --> 00:54:58,364
But what the problem is, is all these people are talking about how great this is.

520
00:54:58,824 --> 00:55:00,106
They don't live next door to it.

521
00:55:00,346 --> 00:55:01,568
It doesn't affect them.

522
00:55:02,389 --> 00:55:03,511
You put a walk down.

523
00:55:03,611 --> 00:55:07,616
My friend, Mike David, his wife is my niece.

524
00:55:09,188 --> 00:55:13,209
There's people down there at 10 o'clock at nighttime, walking their dogs.

525
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:20,191
There's no kids, the only kids that are playing in that park live on the house next to 69 Grove.

526
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:22,112
They go in there, they're lacrosse kids.

527
00:55:22,372 --> 00:55:24,793
There's no kids in it, it's a dog park.

528
00:55:25,753 --> 00:55:27,494
Okay, full of dog crap.

529
00:55:27,714 --> 00:55:31,255
You're talking about this big site that you wanna keep nice and clean.

530
00:55:31,455 --> 00:55:33,796
You've been letting the dogs crap in there for 30 years.

531
00:55:35,714 --> 00:55:37,136
No one knows the history of this property.

532
00:55:37,156 --> 00:55:38,698
You're talking about history, about water.

533
00:55:38,958 --> 00:55:43,604
You have a Massachusetts water easement going through there.

534
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:47,769
There's an MBTA easement next door to my house.

535
00:55:48,069 --> 00:55:50,552
I am the only true abuttor to that property.

536
00:55:50,772 --> 00:55:51,934
You never notified me.

537
00:55:53,218 --> 00:55:54,059
It's just like, why?

538
00:55:54,379 --> 00:55:55,921
I've talked to the traffic department.

539
00:55:56,141 --> 00:56:00,106
You're going to put a crosswalk at the end of my driveway?

540
00:56:00,406 --> 00:56:02,108
What's going to happen then when someone backs out?

541
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:04,411
They back out, they're going to be back into a crosswalk.

542
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:11,279
Crosswalks are supposed to be 120 feet from an existing structure unless it calls for it.

543
00:56:11,779 --> 00:56:12,761
It doesn't call for it.

544
00:56:13,061 --> 00:56:16,846
You're gonna walk, people are gonna walk, and where are they gonna go?

545
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,572
You're talking, and someone else said that the only place for the kids.

546
00:56:21,152 --> 00:56:23,115
Medford has more green space.

547
00:56:23,376 --> 00:56:25,078
My son is wildlife.

548
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:28,262
He knows every piece of green space in this town.

549
00:56:29,496 --> 00:56:33,137
We have more green space in Medford, Mystic Lakes, Brooks Estates.

550
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:36,297
There must be 100 acres in back there.

551
00:56:36,898 --> 00:56:38,998
You have to cross the street to green space.

552
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:41,599
People are so lucky to live in West Medford.

553
00:56:41,939 --> 00:56:44,499
And what happens, they're destroying it by doing things like this.

554
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:46,060
Go in there and clean the park up.

555
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,160
The wall in my driveway, why don't you just complete it?

556
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:55,162
You're gonna make a wall, you're gonna put sidewalk, just get the, send your guys over tomorrow and complete the wall.

557
00:56:55,702 --> 00:56:56,582
Why don't you do that?

558
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:05,307
You think if you live to 69 grocery and you went out there and someone's walking behind your car, you'd be out of your mind.

559
00:57:06,147 --> 00:57:09,030
At 10 o'clock in the nighttime, there's people walking their dogs.

560
00:57:10,511 --> 00:57:12,913
It's not in your backyard, so it doesn't bother you.

561
00:57:13,033 --> 00:57:17,517
One person lives on Jackson Road, one person lives on Tyler, one person lives on John.

562
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:20,339
None of these people have been there as long as I have.

563
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,162
I was there, never a problem.

564
00:57:23,602 --> 00:57:24,563
Beautiful neighborhood.

565
00:57:25,392 --> 00:57:27,552
The woods were much better than they are right now.

566
00:57:28,052 --> 00:57:29,373
You didn't take care of them for years.

567
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:31,213
Once in a while, you would cut the grass in them.

568
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:36,054
That opening, that driveway, that was a very small opening.

569
00:57:36,314 --> 00:57:39,955
What happened was they removed the big rocks so they could get their lawnmowers in it.

570
00:57:39,975 --> 00:57:40,975
That's how it all started.

571
00:57:41,395 --> 00:57:50,396
I've owned that house since 2003, and I've lived on Johnson Avenue since, for 30 years.

572
00:57:50,656 --> 00:57:52,637
I just sold my house there, and I still own 69 Grocery.

573
00:57:54,532 --> 00:57:55,713
I've already made contacts.

574
00:57:55,933 --> 00:57:57,534
Traffic department's gonna come out here.

575
00:57:58,135 --> 00:57:59,676
They don't want a problem there.

576
00:58:00,536 --> 00:58:02,298
We never had a problem on Johnson Avenue.

577
00:58:02,478 --> 00:58:08,322
They destroyed the other part where Johnson Avenue meets the grocery.

578
00:58:08,362 --> 00:58:09,443
They destroyed that area.

579
00:58:09,663 --> 00:58:10,944
There was never an accident there.

580
00:58:12,503 --> 00:58:14,346
John, thank you so much for your comments.

581
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:16,529
I need to move on to some other comments now.

582
00:58:16,549 --> 00:58:17,730
You should have notified me.

583
00:58:18,031 --> 00:58:19,292
You never notified me.

584
00:58:19,553 --> 00:58:20,895
I'm the only abutter.

585
00:58:21,556 --> 00:58:22,437
Never gonna notify.

586
00:58:22,617 --> 00:58:24,600
I get notifications from people in the neighborhood.

587
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,201
You know what they do?

588
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:26,703
You can take people's pocketbooks.

589
00:58:27,043 --> 00:58:29,366
It's not in your backyard, so it doesn't bother you.

590
00:58:30,067 --> 00:58:31,668
And that's what that's what the whole thing is.

591
00:58:32,048 --> 00:58:33,849
You want to invasive plants.

592
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:39,073
You've been digging stuff and those guys destroyed the place and you're saying it's a sensitive thing.

593
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:47,058
Would allow you to come to my property with 510 510 wheels of stone and dump it in there without even asking me.

594
00:58:47,698 --> 00:58:48,499
I had the police there.

595
00:58:48,519 --> 00:58:50,660
They said, hey, if they crack the driveway, they have to fix it.

596
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,001
Who allowed that?

597
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:54,082
John, thank you so much.

598
00:58:54,162 --> 00:58:56,003
I'm sorry I have to move on to other comments.

599
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:57,124
Thank you very much.

600
00:58:57,304 --> 00:58:58,045
Thank you so much.

601
00:58:59,613 --> 00:59:04,236
Frank, I see your hand, and if you could get your name and address for the record, please, you're up next.

602
00:59:05,777 --> 00:59:07,798
Yeah, thanks very much, Frank Miller.

603
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:13,342
I live at 56 Grove, so I am one of the abutters that John says.

604
00:59:13,422 --> 00:59:18,025
So I do live very close to the park, closer than John lived.

605
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:20,867
My grandson plays over there all the time.

606
00:59:20,887 --> 00:59:21,908
He's 10 years old.

607
00:59:22,328 --> 00:59:23,629
He's used it extensively.

608
00:59:25,831 --> 00:59:28,635
I see other children there as well, so I know it's used.

609
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:35,805
Certainly people walk their dogs there as well, but that aside, just a couple of things.

610
00:59:35,845 --> 00:59:37,127
First of all, thank you so much.

611
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:39,610
I think it's a major improvement.

612
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:41,132
I'm glad you're cleaning up all the

613
00:59:42,228 --> 00:59:47,592
The deadwood and I'm always concerned there's going to be a fire in them because of all the deadwood and dead trees.

614
00:59:47,653 --> 00:59:49,134
So that's a great improvement.

615
00:59:49,234 --> 00:59:50,255
And I like everything you're doing.

616
00:59:50,275 --> 00:59:59,462
The only thing I'm a little bit disappointed about, because I think in the initial plan, you had said they were going to be gray sidewalks and it looks like you've backed away from that.

617
00:59:59,522 --> 01:00:01,024
So, is that still a possibility?

618
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:20,551
So, we, we talked about doing raised sidewalks with the traffic department and the problem is that it involves the installation of a catch basin, which adds a monumental amount of cost.

619
01:00:20,691 --> 01:00:22,393
If there's not 1 already there.

620
01:00:23,014 --> 01:00:29,097
And in most cases, there is not one near where we're proposing for the crosswalk.

621
01:00:29,157 --> 01:00:35,979
So what we're focusing on, you know, there's the speed hump that is existing there.

622
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,081
We could work with traffic to try to put in another one.

623
01:00:39,101 --> 01:00:49,905
The other thing we had talked about with them is perhaps establishing a safety zone along the edge of the park so that the speed limit, instead of being what it is citywide, 25, would be more

624
01:00:52,186 --> 01:00:53,467
like 20 miles an hour.

625
01:00:54,407 --> 01:01:04,072
But we know that people speed along this road, sight lines are an issue, and that some people want to make it safe by getting people to slow down.

626
01:01:04,232 --> 01:01:08,134
And we do know that it is a cut through on the way to get to places.

627
01:01:08,234 --> 01:01:15,958
I myself have gone through here from other parts of Medford, but maybe getting people to slow down will help make it safer.

628
01:01:16,078 --> 01:01:18,640
Maybe even just use with the signage will help.

629
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,361
make it a little bit safer.

630
01:01:20,461 --> 01:01:26,166
But if we can put in the raised sidewalks, we will.

631
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:33,133
But otherwise, we'll do the opposite and just make sure that it's accessible with the ramps on either side.

632
01:01:33,153 --> 01:01:34,794
Thanks very much.

633
01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:36,456
Thank you, Frank.

634
01:01:37,016 --> 01:01:38,458
Diane, I see you up next.

635
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,570
Okay, hi, Diane Noel.

636
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:52,674
I live on 11 Newton Road, right across from the park, One House Inn.

637
01:01:52,694 --> 01:02:00,140
I think I agree with every speaker here in at least one way, which is to say, thank you so much for this presentation.

638
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:07,847
I'm really impressed and proud that we're looking at Medford history and being very thoughtful about it.

639
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:09,748
So thank you for that work.

640
01:02:11,438 --> 01:02:18,280
Echoing John, I would like to say that I think that community awareness is sort of key.

641
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:28,342
I feel that, you know, if I didn't sign up for your newsletter and if I wasn't sort of interested in this topic, I wouldn't have known about this meeting tonight.

642
01:02:28,422 --> 01:02:34,063
And I think there are a lot of interested people in the community that just aren't aware that decisions are being made.

643
01:02:34,723 --> 01:02:36,804
So I don't know if that means literally like

644
01:02:37,184 --> 01:02:47,595
Papering the neighborhood to John's point, you know, I just feel that there's not a lot of transparency into decision making and there's a lot of interested.

645
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:56,064
Uh, butters and community members that I think would at least like awareness, if not the ability to, you know, to speak up at meetings.

646
01:02:57,742 --> 01:03:01,665
Can I just cut in real quick and ask a question for the general public.

647
01:03:03,707 --> 01:03:15,415
For those of you who are here, did any of you get a reverse 911 call because we asked the city to put one out about two weeks ago and if one wasn't put out, I know they put it up on the city calendar but I did ask them to do

648
01:03:16,176 --> 01:03:39,223
a reverse call just so just so the word gets out you know we do want to make sure that you know there are other other ways for people you know i i posted this on social media city put it on their calendar but yes we we do know that not everybody's on facebook not everybody's on social media so um you know we do want to make sure we capture the people like you know john who would you know hear their phone and pick up the message like that everybody used to

649
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:44,232
And I did get one, but I I mean, I live at the other end of Grove and I'm signed up for the city alerts.

650
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:46,616
So are you guys all signed up for the city alerts?

651
01:03:46,977 --> 01:03:48,139
Yes, I did not get one.

652
01:03:49,032 --> 01:03:54,275
Okay, then we'll check into that because we specifically asked for I mean, I know it went out because I got it.

653
01:03:54,335 --> 01:03:56,436
But what good does that I mean, I'm running a meeting.

654
01:03:56,496 --> 01:04:08,882
So, so, if I could just briefly, if you are signed up for city alerts, and you didn't and you are in this area and didn't get a message, you may not have your address in the system.

655
01:04:09,702 --> 01:04:12,343
And that's something that we've been identifying as a problem.

656
01:04:12,763 --> 01:04:15,523
So you can go on the city's website to the alerts.

657
01:04:15,683 --> 01:04:25,646
You can customize it, whether it's your cell phone, if it's a text message, you can get it in the email, you can get a paper, not paper, landline.

658
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:33,788
But if you don't have your address in there, then you will not get localized messages like this one.

659
01:04:34,288 --> 01:04:35,708
So I just wanted people to realize that.

660
01:04:36,048 --> 01:04:45,656
Yeah, I know it's hard and I know no one gets a paper anymore, but I mean, there are avenues for sure, both old school and social media.

661
01:04:45,776 --> 01:04:54,984
I just know that it's really hard to get keyed into these meetings and there's so many people that are interested in this park, in this neighborhood.

662
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:59,208
I think they would appreciate more of an awareness.

663
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:03,452
So if you could try maybe a little bit harder on different avenues to at least

664
01:05:04,132 --> 01:05:04,933
get that word out.

665
01:05:05,993 --> 01:05:07,074
I think that would be helpful.

666
01:05:08,776 --> 01:05:15,581
I want to again reiterate another commenter with the closing of the Newton Road entrance.

667
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:19,143
Obviously, as a person on Newton Road, I really miss that.

668
01:05:20,224 --> 01:05:24,728
It really makes that end of the park almost a dead end.

669
01:05:25,948 --> 01:05:29,709
for the south side, not only for access, but for also enjoyment.

670
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:45,274
Not a lot of people are gonna go into the middle of the park and then wander back toward that area, which was really, until you closed it, the way in, the way in for literally everyone on the south side.

671
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:49,876
And I hear John's frustration and the renter's frustration as well.

672
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:51,796
everyone's frustrated.

673
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,977
You know, we want it back.

674
01:05:54,597 --> 01:05:59,159
We want the entrance back just to open up the full extent of the park.

675
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:07,521
So I know that's a pretty consistent message that most everyone in the neighborhood

676
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:11,245
Other than perhaps john and the right to support.

677
01:06:12,326 --> 01:06:17,012
But, you know, just make an entrance that that everyone had back again.

678
01:06:17,032 --> 01:06:23,239
And then, and then my, my, my comment, which is, I think, unique and not not one that's been said so far as.

679
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,802
Again, I think the planning is great.

680
01:06:25,922 --> 01:06:27,544
I think what you're doing is great.

681
01:06:27,944 --> 01:06:31,808
My concern is always with maintenance and future state.

682
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:41,316
It's one thing to have a beautiful park that's done and pretty pictures, but as we've seen, if you don't have a budget or thought to maintaining this,

683
01:06:42,317 --> 01:06:45,640
It can get pretty crappy in a really short time.

684
01:06:46,121 --> 01:07:00,154
And so please just consider that as you're planning that there's a line item in your budget or in your thought for how to keep it as beautiful as it can be the day you make it.

685
01:07:00,334 --> 01:07:01,475
So thank you.

686
01:07:02,216 --> 01:07:02,917
Thank you, Diane.

687
01:07:04,678 --> 01:07:07,000
I just want to jump in on that note.

688
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,242
And I think this is a good philosophy for the entire city to have.

689
01:07:11,863 --> 01:07:14,905
I would treat this landscape just like I would a historic building.

690
01:07:14,925 --> 01:07:22,129
The more maintenance and preservation you do on it, the less it's going to take for upkeep and catching up, so to speak.

691
01:07:22,189 --> 01:07:33,116
So, yes, we're moving forward with cleaning up the park in the hopes that it will stay clean and well-maintained and well-used so that it does get the budget that it deserves.

692
01:07:35,632 --> 01:07:38,575
Okay, next commenter, I see C. Mariano.

693
01:07:38,595 --> 01:07:41,537
If you'd like to give us your name and address for the record, please.

694
01:07:42,178 --> 01:07:45,921
It's actually her husband, Terrodon Collins, 91 Ravine Road.

695
01:07:49,063 --> 01:07:50,424
There's a lot of things going on.

696
01:07:50,444 --> 01:07:51,845
I like the overall plan.

697
01:07:51,865 --> 01:07:55,128
It looks good.

698
01:07:55,148 --> 01:07:57,110
There are a lot of Widowmaker trees out there.

699
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:02,231
It's kind of like doing a project at home, right?

700
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:05,992
The archaeological flags are still out there.

701
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:06,952
So, that's garbage.

702
01:08:08,812 --> 01:08:09,813
You walk those trails.

703
01:08:09,913 --> 01:08:14,114
I'm in this woods at least 30 minutes a day, every day.

704
01:08:15,354 --> 01:08:23,236
My son and I go out there and have had to clean up all the broken glass that the wall makers tossed up and that are in the trail.

705
01:08:23,276 --> 01:08:24,837
We still aren't even close.

706
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:34,972
If you go out and you want to do a sidewalk on the side of Grove, on that side, it's not wide enough.

707
01:08:35,732 --> 01:08:37,454
You're not going to now have a wide enough road.

708
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:41,499
So the wall should have been pushed back at that point to alleviate John's issues.

709
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:44,582
And I agree, there should be a south entrance, 100%.

710
01:08:49,028 --> 01:08:58,432
The leftover trees that are still in there lead the entire neighborhood up and down the entire road of Grove to throw their own trash in there.

711
01:08:59,052 --> 01:09:01,533
It's becoming a pile of garbage over and over.

712
01:09:02,934 --> 01:09:05,255
I agree with the invasive species.

713
01:09:05,435 --> 01:09:08,336
We go out there and we pull garlic mustard all the time.

714
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:09,457
I do it on every dog walk.

715
01:09:09,497 --> 01:09:14,539
I pull garlic mustard while he's sniffing around, you know, and there are definitely areas we've made a difference, but

716
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:17,800
This whole area, it used to be kind of nice.

717
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,462
Now there's mud piles because the trail is dirty and deep.

718
01:09:22,122 --> 01:09:22,782
There's glass.

719
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:25,864
I can't get over the amount of glass that was torn up with the wall.

720
01:09:25,964 --> 01:09:26,784
It's ridiculous.

721
01:09:28,245 --> 01:09:29,606
There's so much more that can be done.

722
01:09:29,626 --> 01:09:34,868
But to everybody else's concerns, this is not a public park.

723
01:09:35,568 --> 01:09:36,909
This is a local park.

724
01:09:37,649 --> 01:09:41,111
This is not going to be a draw for people to come visit.

725
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:43,052
I live across from the wall.

726
01:09:43,952 --> 01:09:50,096
maybe four times a year, I see someone actually stop in Grove Street and go up and read the sign.

727
01:09:50,116 --> 01:09:51,537
You know what I mean?

728
01:09:51,597 --> 01:10:01,705
So I really, I appreciate the idea of making it better, but I think you just need to measure yourself when it comes to, it's not going to be a draw.

729
01:10:02,728 --> 01:10:04,109
to the greater public.

730
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:05,530
You know what I mean?

731
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:14,536
So your input from the people that abut it, whether it be directly or on the roads that are around it, are the most important things.

732
01:10:15,256 --> 01:10:20,460
I mean, if there's going to be a victory garden in there and... The victory garden is off the table.

733
01:10:21,058 --> 01:10:27,520
Okay, that's good because we've been having internal conversations on that because we've had rat problems in the entire area.

734
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:30,001
So, okay.

735
01:10:31,261 --> 01:10:35,463
So that was one thing, but like, you know, the field hardly gets mowed maybe twice a year.

736
01:10:37,003 --> 01:10:39,083
even from their guys, there's still a pile of gravel.

737
01:10:39,644 --> 01:10:49,546
So in there, uh, I literally pulled the bottom of a cone out from the park the other day and sat it on the side of the road, hoping that someone from the town would finally come pick it up.

738
01:10:49,566 --> 01:10:51,386
Cause it's been in there since the wall was done.

739
01:10:51,406 --> 01:10:57,207
Um, I saw one time on C clicks fix, someone complained about the dumping in there.

740
01:10:57,267 --> 01:11:00,708
And I guess that turned into an argument with whoever came out to look at it, but

741
01:11:01,628 --> 01:11:09,433
I mean, if you, if you don't, if you start a project and you leave it looking like garbage, people are going to turn around and think, oh, this is still garbage.

742
01:11:09,513 --> 01:11:10,734
I can do whatever I want with it.

743
01:11:11,594 --> 01:11:16,798
So it seems like the project was started, but not finished for phase one.

744
01:11:16,818 --> 01:11:21,621
You know, with the flags around the guard, like it's just, it's gross in there.

745
01:11:21,641 --> 01:11:24,202
It used to be a lot nicer before the wall was starting to be quite honest with you.

746
01:11:25,903 --> 01:11:30,787
I hope that the plan that you have laid forth comes to fruition and away.

747
01:11:30,987 --> 01:11:39,274
I would love that, you know, hopefully that's still on the board, the bridge over to the park, because once again, people have to walk all the way up.

748
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:41,436
The kids have to go all the way up and around Grove Street.

749
01:11:41,856 --> 01:11:44,398
I'll tell you this, Mike, there's a fence down.

750
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:53,646
My son goes across the train tracks, you know, because it's almost safer than going up and around the corner of Grove to go down to play center.

751
01:11:54,386 --> 01:11:57,107
You know, so those are my concerns.

752
01:11:57,127 --> 01:11:57,927
There's a lot of them.

753
01:11:58,007 --> 01:12:00,508
I should have been making a list, but I'd probably take 30 minutes.

754
01:12:01,749 --> 01:12:08,231
But I would definitely involve the locals more, you know, because if you don't live around here, you're not coming to this park.

755
01:12:08,611 --> 01:12:10,092
You know, this isn't car park.

756
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:11,132
This isn't hickey.

757
01:12:11,172 --> 01:12:12,333
This isn't anything like that.

758
01:12:12,633 --> 01:12:12,793
So.

759
01:12:14,142 --> 01:12:18,264
Thank you so much, and certainly feel free to email us if you think of more things.

760
01:12:19,304 --> 01:12:21,225
You know, this is a continuing conversation.

761
01:12:21,245 --> 01:12:24,466
And I have one more point.

762
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:25,907
Hold on, John.

763
01:12:25,987 --> 01:12:30,268
John, I need to, I have other folks that have had their hand up, so I just like to make one point.

764
01:12:31,289 --> 01:12:31,929
Very quickly.

765
01:12:32,489 --> 01:12:38,492
Diane was talking about her child walking down the driveway and bringing the people walking there.

766
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:40,813
How would anyone else feel if they lived there?

767
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,566
And they had kids, and there's people walking down their driveway.

768
01:12:44,786 --> 01:12:45,686
My privacy's in.

769
01:12:46,086 --> 01:12:49,648
And why don't they just close off the wall and put the opening on the middle of the street?

770
01:12:49,668 --> 01:12:51,129
I don't understand why they just don't do that.

771
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:55,452
Close that wall off tomorrow and open it up on Grove Street.

772
01:12:55,832 --> 01:13:01,275
And that sidewalk, like he was correct, that sidewalk is not wide enough to do that sidewalk.

773
01:13:01,815 --> 01:13:04,517
And the wall was a terrible job, and it is a mess in there.

774
01:13:05,397 --> 01:13:08,619
And it's noisier than it was before, because all that junk is out of there.

775
01:13:10,757 --> 01:13:12,537
They need to go back to phase 1.

776
01:13:12,777 --> 01:13:15,338
Thank you, John.

777
01:13:15,358 --> 01:13:17,198
Thank you so much.

778
01:13:17,678 --> 01:13:21,279
Before the folks chime in, let me just offer some clarification, which may help.

779
01:13:21,739 --> 01:13:28,460
So in the discussion of closing off that far end, there's a couple of different things.

780
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,021
We couldn't put a crosswalk there because there's an existing crosswalk.

781
01:13:32,061 --> 01:13:35,382
We don't want people crossing at the driveway location.

782
01:13:35,462 --> 01:13:36,322
But beyond that,

783
01:13:37,202 --> 01:13:44,184
We do want, as I mentioned before, to focus people on the main crossing at Jackson Road, so that needs the sidewalk.

784
01:13:44,344 --> 01:13:46,525
There's five feet along the entire wall.

785
01:13:46,545 --> 01:13:50,846
There actually is more than that in a few locations, but there's five feet.

786
01:13:50,866 --> 01:13:56,367
The ADA sidewalk needs to be 48 inches, wall to curb, and 36 inches clear.

787
01:13:56,487 --> 01:13:57,088
We have that.

788
01:13:57,148 --> 01:13:58,808
We measured it the other day while we were on the

789
01:13:58,888 --> 01:13:59,168
park.

790
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:08,817
In terms of cost, we looked at the cost of both opening the wall back up or the cost of extending the sidewalk.

791
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:14,423
The sidewalk down to Jackson Road is infinitely cheaper to the tune of about $10,000.

792
01:14:14,563 --> 01:14:17,626
It was going to cost somewhere in the vicinity of

793
01:14:18,106 --> 01:14:26,628
$36,000 to get the contractor to come back, mobilize, open up the wall, pull back the sidewalk, and pull the walls in, have that opening.

794
01:14:26,648 --> 01:14:38,091
It's gonna cost about $20,000 or less, depending on how much that ties into the larger project, to put the sidewalk in, put the curb cut in, put the crosswalk in and identify.

795
01:14:38,191 --> 01:14:41,692
So we're just trying to weigh the pros and cons of both.

796
01:14:42,472 --> 01:14:49,159
public comments versus also making sure that we're fiscally responsible with the amount of money that we're given with taxes.

797
01:14:49,299 --> 01:14:52,122
But again, all of this is up for discussion.

798
01:14:52,382 --> 01:14:53,724
Everybody, it's an opinion.

799
01:14:54,104 --> 01:14:57,868
So traffic could all of a sudden say, no, don't do that.

800
01:14:58,008 --> 01:15:00,751
Let's go back to the idea of putting in the wall and we'll do that.

801
01:15:01,011 --> 01:15:11,534
But, you know, we also have to provide the ADA amenities to make sure that the park is accessible, because we've received, you know, we've received comments that people want to use the park, and we are obligated.

802
01:15:11,574 --> 01:15:18,415
And as part of that previous work, we wanted to say, if we're going to be opening, closing entrances, they're all going to be accessible.

803
01:15:18,435 --> 01:15:28,238
The park's going to be universally accessible to all, you know, and even if it's not used by people from the other parts of the community, it's there so that it could be.

804
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:29,099
Right.

805
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:38,713
So I think that's the general consensus is that it is, you know, even though the public may not come to it, it's available to them if they want to come to it.

806
01:15:38,733 --> 01:15:41,717
You can't certainly can't make somebody or for somebody to come to it.

807
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:43,480
But, you know, I.

808
01:15:44,481 --> 01:15:53,764
You guys as neighbors, certainly we want to make it work for you, but we also need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to make it work for the entire city as well.

809
01:15:53,884 --> 01:16:03,667
This is, you know, M-Belt and the Royal House have their own little locations, but this is really the only city's park that celebrates some part of history.

810
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:08,508
Benjamin O'Cady, you can make your comment.

811
01:16:08,548 --> 01:16:10,309
If we can get your name and address for the record, please.

812
01:16:12,062 --> 01:16:14,344
Hi, I'm Olga, Katie, I'm Benjamin's wife.

813
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:16,445
So I have a couple of comments I'd like to share.

814
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:19,327
And we're at 38 Jackson Road.

815
01:16:20,428 --> 01:16:21,909
So thank you for this presentation.

816
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:31,956
And it's, it's obvious that you've, you know, taken a lot of community input to heart and in designing the presentation and coming back with another rendition for phase two.

817
01:16:32,016 --> 01:16:38,341
So I appreciate you listening to the community so closely, especially those of us who use the park every day and are

818
01:16:41,535 --> 01:16:46,519
very active stakeholders in its preservation and utility for the members of this community.

819
01:16:46,599 --> 01:16:56,325
The comments I have specifically relate to the tree planning for the park and the sound barrier and maintenance.

820
01:16:56,626 --> 01:17:07,233
So what we've noticed, my husband and I, in the last three years that we've lived here, is that since phase one was completed, the sound barrier has been completely destroyed.

821
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:08,654
The noise from the train is

822
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,542
is ridiculous and our house shakes.

823
01:17:11,662 --> 01:17:21,050
Like there's a mini earthquake happening several times a day because of the shaking as a result of the trees that were taken down for the wall restoration of part one.

824
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:36,102
So I'm very concerned about the additional trees that will be taken down in later phases of the project because even though you'll be planting some new ones, hopefully the timeline is just mismatched because the time will take those trees to mature to the level

825
01:17:36,612 --> 01:17:39,733
of the current trees being taken down is gonna be 20, 30 years.

826
01:17:40,213 --> 01:17:45,555
So before they're able to be an effective sound barrier is going to be quite a bit of length of time.

827
01:17:45,575 --> 01:17:48,617
And in the meantime, the noise from the trains is ridiculous.

828
01:17:48,657 --> 01:17:52,978
The shaking is awful as far as the sound barrier destruction that's happened.

829
01:17:53,919 --> 01:18:03,202
And it's causing issues for foundation and just additional negative externalities that you probably may not have thought of initially in designing this project.

830
01:18:03,262 --> 01:18:05,063
So I think other measures need to be

831
01:18:05,654 --> 01:18:17,449
taken to reduce the sound barrier effect of taking down additional trees and any trees that are planted need to be very fast growing to replace that sound barrier.

832
01:18:17,956 --> 01:18:19,237
as fast as possible.

833
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:24,241
The second concern I have is with respect to the maintenance of those trees.

834
01:18:24,862 --> 01:18:27,384
Specifically, who is handling those projects?

835
01:18:27,444 --> 01:18:30,146
Will that be Medford Forestry Department?

836
01:18:30,606 --> 01:18:33,489
Will that be a private arborist?

837
01:18:33,549 --> 01:18:38,012
Is there money set aside for watering those trees, the new trees, and making sure they survive?

838
01:18:39,433 --> 01:18:51,259
because a lot of the trees planted in Medford, the new trees, first of all, they take forever to get planted for issues we're not gonna discuss today, but also there's no maintenance of those trees because no one's watering them because there's no money.

839
01:18:51,379 --> 01:19:01,304
So any new trees being planted basically need to be babied for three years at least on a regular basis to make sure they survive.

840
01:19:01,324 --> 01:19:03,766
Yeah, so,

841
01:19:05,463 --> 01:19:27,736
You know, while I'm trying to think of, like, good ideas for sound barrier, you know, and maybe it makes sense to find a way to landscape the edge along the railroad side with more low shrubbery type things that will dissipate the noise for the entirety of the park.

842
01:19:27,916 --> 01:19:30,198
And, you know, maybe we could make the tree budget go farther.

843
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:40,705
That way, that's something we can certainly discuss with Peter, who's a landscape architect, who would certainly be able to help and look at that.

844
01:19:40,825 --> 01:19:43,727
And we can address that.

845
01:19:43,747 --> 01:19:45,368
We can try to look at that.

846
01:19:45,388 --> 01:19:50,152
The MBTA fence, as somebody mentioned, it's down.

847
01:19:50,592 --> 01:19:54,455
We want to make sure that that goes back up after the tree work is done.

848
01:19:54,855 --> 01:20:01,801
Done so that, you know, there is a no longer an unsafe crossing there because the trains, once the construction is done, they're going to start.

849
01:20:02,361 --> 01:20:06,624
You know, heading back up full speed and not all of them stop through there.

850
01:20:06,644 --> 01:20:14,851
So I will hate to interject a little bit, but my son and I, and we can attest this because she's kind of made fun of me in the past, but.

851
01:20:15,491 --> 01:20:31,662
We've actually tried to clean off from the left of Poms Walter Ravine by the roadside and in back of it, and actually weed stuff and go in and do native planting flowers, like an actual pollinated type garden on that side.

852
01:20:33,033 --> 01:20:45,162
Everything on the front and back side of that wall is a sliver of dirt, not soil, dirt, with nothing but rock below it.

853
01:20:46,403 --> 01:21:00,714
The sheer fact that we have friends donate different irises and different like, you know, bulbs this year that we tried to plant in that back of the wall, you know, by the, if you know the area, there's a tree, like a little hump behind the left of the wall.

854
01:21:01,535 --> 01:21:07,259
But one thing to keep in mind is definitely the watering, because I'm not sure if any of those are going to take.

855
01:21:07,299 --> 01:21:12,302
My seeds, I put down $60 worth of seeds this year, $80 worth of seeds last year.

856
01:21:12,903 --> 01:21:22,810
We have a few that took, but with, I hate to say the term, because some people don't like it, I don't know who's on here, but with the climate change, it has been a very hot, dry winter.

857
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,732
If you live here, you know where that sun comes.

858
01:21:25,772 --> 01:21:28,794
The sun does not necessarily hit that area directly.

859
01:21:29,495 --> 01:21:33,909
And it is super, super dry over there and it's not soil.

860
01:21:33,929 --> 01:21:35,574
There's no soil.

861
01:21:36,759 --> 01:21:38,240
on either side of that wall directly.

862
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:43,281
Once you're inside or in the past, there's a ton of soil full of weeds.

863
01:21:44,142 --> 01:21:52,844
But if you're going to do anything decorative, like the irises or whatever those plants were, someone's got to take care of it, especially with the tree plantings.

864
01:21:53,305 --> 01:21:54,765
Then there's no direct water over there.

865
01:21:54,805 --> 01:22:01,687
I've literally considered asking my neighbors so I can use their house on the corner and run a hose off their house across the street.

866
01:22:02,328 --> 01:22:05,369
It's just pointless at this point, I think.

867
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:08,591
And the weeds are ridiculous everywhere.

868
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:11,334
I mean, the town just comes by once a year in the fall and weed whacks everything.

869
01:22:11,354 --> 01:22:14,577
I actually had a garden that was growing last year and they came through and weed whacked everything.

870
01:22:14,898 --> 01:22:15,759
So, yeah.

871
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:17,280
But that's it.

872
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:18,381
I just want to point that out.

873
01:22:18,561 --> 01:22:21,605
Something else you'll have to budget for if you're thinking of doing that, so.

874
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:22,923
Thank you so much.

875
01:22:23,023 --> 01:22:32,646
Thank you Olga as well for those comments and we will definitely take another look at the landscaping plan, the trees, maintenance.

876
01:22:33,387 --> 01:22:44,450
I made a list here and so you know we will consult with Peter and some of our other folks to talk about that and and think deeper about that.

877
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,411
So thank you so much.

878
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:46,131
Thank you.

879
01:22:48,175 --> 01:22:50,557
Okay, next up, I see BNIC.

880
01:22:50,717 --> 01:22:54,179
If you could unmute yourself and give us your name and address for the record.

881
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:09,549
Hello, BNIC.

882
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:12,991
Would you like to make a comment?

883
01:23:13,011 --> 01:23:14,012
You have your hand raised.

884
01:23:17,433 --> 01:23:19,239
We cannot hear you if you're trying to speak.

885
01:23:22,169 --> 01:23:24,317
They unmuted themselves, but we can't hear them.

886
01:23:27,312 --> 01:23:30,373
Okay, I'm gonna go on to the next person and I will come back to you.

887
01:23:31,274 --> 01:23:34,175
Diane, if you'd like to make, I saw your hand up again.

888
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:42,919
Yeah, yeah, I just wanted to address Ryan's comment about doing a cost analysis for, what was it, a sidewalk versus the wall.

889
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:53,084
And again, just going back to getting input, I think if you would have asked before you closed off the Newton Road wall, we could have saved you $36,000.

890
01:23:55,145 --> 01:23:55,426
Right.

891
01:23:55,526 --> 01:24:01,638
So that's a frustration that I think that, you know, a lot of us will address.

892
01:24:02,259 --> 01:24:06,006
I also think if you ask the community, which would you prefer?

893
01:24:07,347 --> 01:24:12,872
I think we all would say we would prefer that entrance versus spending the money.

894
01:24:12,892 --> 01:24:25,182
So in other words, please reach out to the community and get real volumes of answers, not just the 20 of us who are fortunate enough to have found this meeting.

895
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:34,070
Do a Google poll, do something where you'll actually get consensus before you make decisions.

896
01:24:35,882 --> 01:24:38,504
You know, we didn't ask you to cut that access off.

897
01:24:39,304 --> 01:24:39,684
You did.

898
01:24:41,085 --> 01:24:43,266
And so now we're asking you to put it back.

899
01:24:44,187 --> 01:24:49,129
And you're saying it would be expensive, but it's not anything you should have done in the first place.

900
01:24:49,349 --> 01:24:53,151
So that's a real frustration that I think we all share.

901
01:24:53,972 --> 01:25:01,596
So please listen and seek broad community input before you make decisions like that.

902
01:25:04,873 --> 01:25:05,634
Thank you, Diane.

903
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,936
Again, I'm going to interrupt on that.

904
01:25:09,457 --> 01:25:10,818
It's not in their backyard.

905
01:25:11,638 --> 01:25:16,062
If it was next to their house, these people, let me speak, these people.

906
01:25:16,162 --> 01:25:16,482
No.

907
01:25:17,783 --> 01:25:19,324
John, I'm agreeing with you.

908
01:25:19,945 --> 01:25:24,768
I agree that the access to your property is your property.

909
01:25:25,169 --> 01:25:28,992
I'm asking for the public access to be reopened.

910
01:25:29,392 --> 01:25:32,716
So we actually are, John, agreeing with each other.

911
01:25:32,756 --> 01:25:33,277
No, you're not.

912
01:25:33,317 --> 01:25:37,663
You're still walking down my driveway at 10 o'clock to walk the dog.

913
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:39,545
Everyone's walking dog.

914
01:25:39,685 --> 01:25:40,807
It's a dog park.

915
01:25:40,847 --> 01:25:41,868
We have to clarify this.

916
01:25:41,908 --> 01:25:42,929
John, you're not listening.

917
01:25:43,993 --> 01:25:49,475
We are asking for a Newton Road entrance that it avoids your driveway.

918
01:25:49,675 --> 01:25:55,096
And I don't know if you actually own all the way to that wall, which is the second question, whatever.

919
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,597
We can all pick that up.

920
01:25:56,617 --> 01:25:57,297
All right, guys.

921
01:25:57,377 --> 01:26:00,738
All right, guys.

922
01:26:01,038 --> 01:26:01,858
Thank you so much.

923
01:26:02,418 --> 01:26:05,039
I'm going to have you please take this conversation offline.

924
01:26:05,459 --> 01:26:07,080
We have heard the comments.

925
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,620
We've heard John's side.

926
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:10,241
We've heard the Newton Road neighbor's side.

927
01:26:12,461 --> 01:26:13,902
I'm going to leave it at that for tonight.

928
01:26:13,982 --> 01:26:14,842
Thank you so much.

929
01:26:15,022 --> 01:26:15,843
I appreciate it.

930
01:26:16,663 --> 01:26:22,865
And I'm going to move on to our next person who has their hand raised, which was BNIC.

931
01:26:23,305 --> 01:26:34,910
If you are unable to mute yourself, and we could not hear you before, if you can make yourself known, if you have a comment, otherwise, I'm going to lower your hand and move on to the next person.

932
01:26:43,562 --> 01:26:45,825
Okay, I'm not hearing anything from BNIC.

933
01:26:45,925 --> 01:26:48,608
So again, I will go back to tomorrow.

934
01:26:48,668 --> 01:26:49,710
I see your hand raised.

935
01:26:50,351 --> 01:26:51,492
Feel free to make your comment.

936
01:26:51,993 --> 01:26:52,273
Yeah.

937
01:26:52,333 --> 01:26:52,794
Hey, Jen.

938
01:26:53,635 --> 01:26:59,342
And I, you know, I really agree with a lot of our community members and I hear John's frustration and Diane's and

939
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:08,752
I think that there should be access on the south side of Grove Street that doesn't obviously interfere with someone's personal rights and their personal property.

940
01:27:08,872 --> 01:27:10,473
So I hear you guys loud and clear.

941
01:27:10,873 --> 01:27:15,136
You know, John, I know you've been here for a long time, but I've been here for well over 20 years as well.

942
01:27:15,176 --> 01:27:19,079
You know, I'm not a newbie to this community and it's not just a dog park.

943
01:27:19,699 --> 01:27:21,520
We see a lot of kids coming in and out of there.

944
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:22,401
I enjoy the park.

945
01:27:23,441 --> 01:27:24,962
I know that there's, you know,

946
01:27:25,883 --> 01:27:28,604
reticence for change for a lot of us, right?

947
01:27:28,684 --> 01:27:32,585
We get older and we get to the point in our lives where we don't want to see a lot of change.

948
01:27:32,705 --> 01:27:43,007
But for me, I see us sitting in a neighborhood here where we have real access to something kind of historical.

949
01:27:43,608 --> 01:27:52,870
And I'm not looking to flood our neighborhood with buses and a bunch of school kids either, or like a massive amount of influx of people in the public.

950
01:27:53,290 --> 01:27:58,174
But at the same time, there is a history here, and I think it should be appreciated.

951
01:27:58,654 --> 01:28:10,522
And so my thoughts are, you know, let's do it as I think the folks are doing it in a careful, thoughtful, community-minded way, not trying to introduce a lot of, you know, unnecessary traffic.

952
01:28:10,562 --> 01:28:14,285
But at the same time, this is an area that could be helpful for

953
01:28:14,805 --> 01:28:24,716
You know the brooks school kids to like walk down the street and do like a walking tour one day in the spring, where they understand a little bit more about the history of this area, which I think is very valuable for them to learn about.

954
01:28:25,257 --> 01:28:28,921
And I, among many people, maybe on the call don't want to see history forgotten.

955
01:28:29,882 --> 01:28:36,149
I want to see history appreciated, and I think that there's some really neat stuff about the ship making the ship building and the use of the.

956
01:28:36,529 --> 01:28:39,351
canal and other such things that could be of real value.

957
01:28:40,692 --> 01:28:44,756
That's all I have to say, but I appreciate the carefulness and thoughtfulness of all this.

958
01:28:46,497 --> 01:29:02,250
But I also don't have the same concern about change as long as it's reflective of the community and people understanding that there's a real piece of history here to be told and to be explored in a safe, modest way.

959
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,632
I appreciate everyone doing what they're doing.

960
01:29:06,996 --> 01:29:07,717
Thank you, Tamara.

961
01:29:08,017 --> 01:29:11,480
Is there anybody else that hasn't spoken that would like to speak?

962
01:29:13,041 --> 01:29:13,221
It is 830.

963
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:19,887
I just want to be cognizant of the time and appreciate everybody that's come on and hung on with us here for 90 minutes.

964
01:29:23,890 --> 01:29:26,172
I'm not seeing anybody else raise their hand.

965
01:29:26,192 --> 01:29:27,333
Come on.

966
01:29:29,455 --> 01:29:29,835
I'm sorry.

967
01:29:29,855 --> 01:29:30,976
Is there somebody that would like to speak?

968
01:29:37,308 --> 01:29:38,930
Is there anybody else that would like to make a comment?

969
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:40,911
Hello?

970
01:29:42,413 --> 01:29:43,894
Hi, are you trying to make a comment?

971
01:29:44,355 --> 01:29:45,055
Yes, please.

972
01:29:45,496 --> 01:29:47,537
Can I get your name and address for the record, please?

973
01:29:48,638 --> 01:29:50,080
Hi, Bill Stevens, Wellgate Road.

974
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,261
Thank you so much.

975
01:29:51,341 --> 01:29:51,721
Go ahead.

976
01:29:52,142 --> 01:29:54,404
Just like everybody else, I've lived here for about 30 years.

977
01:29:55,765 --> 01:30:02,991
I'm a little concerned because I think you guys kind of have jumped the gun on this whole project without talking to the neighbors or the residents of this community.

978
01:30:04,454 --> 01:30:05,976
I myself too like the green space.

979
01:30:06,837 --> 01:30:07,758
I like the Mystic Lakes.

980
01:30:07,818 --> 01:30:09,881
I like this little park that we have there.

981
01:30:10,522 --> 01:30:19,453
I'm not one for change, but I do see what you're trying to do making the park more accessible to individuals with wheelchairs, handicapped individuals, but I think

982
01:30:20,317 --> 01:30:29,339
Nobody has actually thought this through where you can actually park an ADA van or type of vehicle on the side streets that you have proposed.

983
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:34,441
I look at the plans and so far I've seen two parking spaces on the side roads.

984
01:30:35,101 --> 01:30:43,943
Can someone explain to me how they think they can actually park an ADA van on the side road and allow access with a wheelchair in and out?

985
01:30:45,805 --> 01:30:51,467
Has anybody given that any thought before this project that it actually has moved forward with the ADA sidewalks?

986
01:30:52,147 --> 01:31:09,993
So the next step for us is to take the schematic design that we have and work with an engineer through the traffic department, DPW, and planning department, and to really dig into the specifics of that very question.

987
01:31:10,133 --> 01:31:13,114
You know, how would it be feasible or not?

988
01:31:13,574 --> 01:31:24,459
to park a van or an ADA vehicle on the street or versus on the site, you know, somewhere, right?

989
01:31:24,519 --> 01:31:28,141
So those specifics... You put the cop before the husband.

990
01:31:29,141 --> 01:31:40,967
So we've had all these conversations and all these zoning laws and by-law changes, and you guys haven't really figured out how accessible this park is going to be to handicapped individuals.

991
01:31:41,965 --> 01:31:45,708
So we're changing the whole narrative here by actually allowing cars to park in the park.

992
01:31:47,249 --> 01:31:52,753
Well, the community asked us to not allow cars in the park, but certainly... You can't park on a side street.

993
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:54,194
We need 96 inches wide.

994
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:55,255
Correct.

995
01:31:55,315 --> 01:32:00,519
So one of the things that we certainly... You can't drop a ramp out of a side of a van onto a sidewalk.

996
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:02,521
That's a resident's walkway.

997
01:32:05,148 --> 01:32:17,133
Well, I'm not I'm not sure because we would have to have an engineer look at it, but that's part of the next process along now that we've secured funding that we will have the designs.

998
01:32:17,873 --> 01:32:23,755
Prepared so that then we can at least show them to the community so that we have those specific answers.

999
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:24,636
You know, this is just the.

1000
01:32:25,256 --> 01:32:26,977
The start of this phase work, right?

1001
01:32:27,057 --> 01:32:37,582
And, of course, the focus will be on taking care of the safety issue, the trees, the, you know, and the archaeology that don't impact any of these other more.

1002
01:32:38,382 --> 01:32:41,884
I wouldn't say, you know, more debated items, right?

1003
01:32:41,984 --> 01:32:44,425
So, for those debatable items, we have.

1004
01:32:44,765 --> 01:32:51,192
you know, at least six months before we even, you know, get out to bid or construction.

1005
01:32:51,352 --> 01:32:54,875
So, but we want to move quickly, right?

1006
01:32:54,935 --> 01:32:59,961
So, you know, as soon as we have those designs, we can present them to the community for your feedback.

1007
01:33:00,401 --> 01:33:01,422
And then- Let's wrap up a minute.

1008
01:33:01,462 --> 01:33:02,803
What if those designs don't work?

1009
01:33:03,404 --> 01:33:08,609
We've now spent three years and up team amount of money on a project that can't move forward.

1010
01:33:09,230 --> 01:33:15,456
So what can be workable first before we spend all this time and energy moving forward.

1011
01:33:15,956 --> 01:33:18,819
So it's not about whether or not it does work.

1012
01:33:19,019 --> 01:33:21,882
It's a matter of making something work.

1013
01:33:21,962 --> 01:33:24,204
So I live here for 30 years.

1014
01:33:24,224 --> 01:33:26,286
I've seen the parking enforcement on that road.

1015
01:33:26,306 --> 01:33:26,686
I've seen

1016
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:33,328
police trying to slow the road down, you put speed bumps in, that road is like a highway.

1017
01:33:34,488 --> 01:33:40,290
I travel that road 15 times a day going back and forth to work, bring my kids to work, down to the train.

1018
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:42,650
The road's a highway.

1019
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:47,211
You've put these signs up, speed bumps, nothing controls the speed.

1020
01:33:47,631 --> 01:33:55,273
Yeah, to actually think you can slow down the road to get someone going over there with a wheelchair,

1021
01:33:58,905 --> 01:33:59,828
someone's going to get killed.

1022
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:02,896
And I don't think you guys have put much thought into this at all.

1023
01:34:02,997 --> 01:34:04,019
It's all blind corners.

1024
01:34:05,555 --> 01:34:12,619
So before we move forward, I'd like to really, really put some consideration before I spend more tax money than I really need to on this project.

1025
01:34:13,019 --> 01:34:13,780
I know it's a grant.

1026
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:15,241
I do know how all that works.

1027
01:34:15,881 --> 01:34:18,663
I do know this town is suffering from maintenance workers.

1028
01:34:19,223 --> 01:34:22,125
We have no maintenance plan in the budget for this property.

1029
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:26,487
I echo the woman talking about the trees.

1030
01:34:27,067 --> 01:34:30,329
The neighborhood, every tree is falling down in front of every house.

1031
01:34:30,389 --> 01:34:32,110
Every house has rotted trees.

1032
01:34:32,571 --> 01:34:34,252
This is a neglected piece of land.

1033
01:34:35,272 --> 01:34:41,395
I just think you guys are jumping the gun on this project, especially with the handicap provisions for this law.

1034
01:34:43,977 --> 01:34:44,597
Thank you, Bill.

1035
01:34:44,657 --> 01:34:45,978
Thank you so much for your comments.

1036
01:34:46,458 --> 01:34:48,419
We will definitely take them into consideration.

1037
01:34:48,439 --> 01:34:56,703
OK, one more time for BNIC, if you'd like to unmute yourself.

1038
01:34:57,584 --> 01:34:59,225
OK, how am I doing?

1039
01:34:59,865 --> 01:35:01,046
Yes, go ahead, sir.

1040
01:35:01,106 --> 01:35:03,047
Can we get your name and address for the record, please?

1041
01:35:03,545 --> 01:35:07,706
Yeah, I'm Bobby Nicotero at 3 Newton Road, and I've been here forever.

1042
01:35:07,726 --> 01:35:11,807
The house vibrates from the train at like 1 a.m.

1043
01:35:11,947 --> 01:35:26,711
some nights, and so, I mean, everything that everyone's touched upon here, excuse me, I've either experienced directly or indirectly, and I must say, my wife made an interesting comment when we moved here in 93.

1044
01:35:26,771 --> 01:35:30,952
She said, Bob, I grew up in Medford, I went to Medford High,

1045
01:35:31,846 --> 01:35:38,368
I thought I knew everything about Method, but I never even knew Rose Street at all, never been here before.

1046
01:35:39,229 --> 01:35:40,789
And you couldn't be more right.

1047
01:35:40,829 --> 01:35:44,271
This is an extremely local, local situation here.

1048
01:35:45,091 --> 01:35:49,593
And we're very sensitive about it because we live, I live right next door.

1049
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,974
And I've seen all of the things that people have mentioned.

1050
01:35:53,843 --> 01:36:06,328
And it would be a shame that it would change at all, to be honest with you, because it's the charm that this park and this neighborhood brings to the people who live here.

1051
01:36:07,028 --> 01:36:07,989
And people love it here.

1052
01:36:08,089 --> 01:36:08,569
They all do.

1053
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:09,850
It's a great community.

1054
01:36:10,730 --> 01:36:13,271
But number one, John couldn't have been more right.

1055
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:20,974
I needed two of my neighbors to tell me about the meeting tonight, so I was not notified for whatever reason.

1056
01:36:21,454 --> 01:36:22,435
I don't blame anybody.

1057
01:36:22,535 --> 01:36:23,035
It's just that

1058
01:36:23,892 --> 01:36:32,597
It's 2024, so I know this should have been given to at least the people in Grove, and those are better.

1059
01:36:32,617 --> 01:36:35,098
But again, it's a local park.

1060
01:36:35,218 --> 01:36:36,739
I do appreciate the history.

1061
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:49,045
I never would have known about Sagamore Park unless my sons hung around the streets with their friends and discovered that there were Native Indians in this part of the country.

1062
01:36:49,786 --> 01:36:52,147
Very interesting about the history, and we love that.

1063
01:36:52,867 --> 01:36:56,808
But there is a charm and a love for history around him.

1064
01:36:56,828 --> 01:36:59,709
And people are very responsive to all of it.

1065
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:03,391
But I must say, Grove Street is like a gauntlet for speeding.

1066
01:37:04,951 --> 01:37:08,653
It seems like cars are either speeding up or slowing down at a rapid rate.

1067
01:37:09,213 --> 01:37:14,435
Unfortunately, a dog was hit by a car and killed not too long ago on Grove.

1068
01:37:14,715 --> 01:37:16,035
And it was very, very sad.

1069
01:37:17,016 --> 01:37:17,696
And it hit home.

1070
01:37:18,822 --> 01:37:28,928
And, you know, I was always afraid that my children would be walking along Grove and my dog would run out to Grove in fear of, you know, cars traveling.

1071
01:37:29,649 --> 01:37:34,672
You'll hear a bang and stuff falling off of a truck when it hits the speed bump still.

1072
01:37:35,993 --> 01:37:43,157
So all of these things together, and then you have a park and more people parking and traveling and visiting.

1073
01:37:43,177 --> 01:37:46,339
You know, the sidewalk is narrow.

1074
01:37:46,359 --> 01:37:47,200
There's no question.

1075
01:37:48,236 --> 01:38:02,546
If I go across the street on that sidewalk, across from my house on Grove, that dirt path, it looks, I guess technically it might look wide, but it doesn't feel wide when the cars are flying by you.

1076
01:38:03,526 --> 01:38:04,987
It's very, very dangerous.

1077
01:38:05,307 --> 01:38:07,229
That's the biggest concern that I have there.

1078
01:38:08,069 --> 01:38:11,672
And it's a busy road, Newton and Grove.

1079
01:38:12,072 --> 01:38:13,613
It's a busy intersection.

1080
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:20,254
Either trucks are new turn there or driving down delivering stuff.

1081
01:38:21,155 --> 01:38:24,637
People turn around there all the time, Uber drivers turn around at that corner.

1082
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:30,241
I do agree that it is a local travel.

1083
01:38:31,362 --> 01:38:34,344
I do think that they should have rethought that entrance big time.

1084
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:42,390
Because if they rethought it and got a lot more input, I mean, everybody was totally confused about that entrance as I was.

1085
01:38:43,281 --> 01:38:45,363
And it should have been well, well thought out.

1086
01:38:45,463 --> 01:38:48,305
And there should have been a ton more input because it is a local thing.

1087
01:38:48,926 --> 01:38:50,407
And I say spend the money.

1088
01:38:50,607 --> 01:38:56,812
Money spent now is nothing, pennies, compared to what it might turn out to be.

1089
01:38:57,513 --> 01:38:58,814
So by all means, spend the money.

1090
01:38:58,834 --> 01:38:59,735
Spend it wisely.

1091
01:39:01,016 --> 01:39:03,377
The last time I checked, it doesn't move that quickly.

1092
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:05,980
So when you set it, it's forever.

1093
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,681
And it is historic.

1094
01:39:07,721 --> 01:39:10,083
So it's really important to do that correctly.

1095
01:39:11,523 --> 01:39:14,945
So I'm directly impacted too, as we all are.

1096
01:39:15,385 --> 01:39:16,426
We've all been here for a while.

1097
01:39:16,446 --> 01:39:20,448
We've all invested a lot of effort in our homes here and we love it here.

1098
01:39:21,109 --> 01:39:25,352
So I recommend to rethink that opening near John's house.

1099
01:39:25,432 --> 01:39:29,915
John works a lot on his house and takes good care of his property.

1100
01:39:31,075 --> 01:39:32,376
Do something about the noise.

1101
01:39:33,457 --> 01:39:39,141
When you're out in the yard, basically years ago before COVID, all you hear is, you'd always hear a bus, a train,

1102
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:43,793
a plane when you're in your backyard over here.

1103
01:39:44,214 --> 01:39:50,678
So anything you can do to make, to use the plant trees and shrubs would be awesome.

1104
01:39:51,459 --> 01:39:59,565
And I mean, that's it basically, but the speed, it is like a gauntlet at Newton and Grove and that's the big ticket item for me.

1105
01:40:00,566 --> 01:40:01,226
Thank you, Bobby.

1106
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:01,947
Thank you so much.

1107
01:40:02,247 --> 01:40:03,688
And I'm glad we got to hear your comment.

1108
01:40:03,868 --> 01:40:04,629
Thank you so much.

1109
01:40:06,325 --> 01:40:07,446
Elyse, you're up next.

1110
01:40:07,907 --> 01:40:09,188
Name and address for the record, please.

1111
01:40:09,428 --> 01:40:14,292
Yeah, Elyse Jennings, 94 Grove Street, so directly across from the slave wall.

1112
01:40:15,714 --> 01:40:18,897
Thank you for holding this meeting and for all of the information.

1113
01:40:18,957 --> 01:40:21,539
I agree with a lot of the things that have been said.

1114
01:40:21,559 --> 01:40:28,145
I wake up thinking there's an earthquake a lot of nights since that work had been done.

1115
01:40:30,287 --> 01:40:34,329
But I just wanted to raise a point that hadn't come up yet.

1116
01:40:34,749 --> 01:40:40,471
Oh, and by the way, I am a dog owner and have a young child on Grove Street.

1117
01:40:41,992 --> 01:40:48,614
But I wanted to raise the point of the crosswalks.

1118
01:40:49,514 --> 01:40:55,657
Well, I understand the need for accessibility, and it would probably be helpful to slow down traffic

1119
01:40:57,759 --> 01:41:02,804
I just am concerned about the eyesores of a lot of signage or flashing lights.

1120
01:41:02,844 --> 01:41:04,646
I don't know what these crosswalks are going to look like.

1121
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:06,768
I don't know how many we really need.

1122
01:41:07,529 --> 01:41:09,911
So I just wanted to raise that point because I hadn't heard it yet.

1123
01:41:13,435 --> 01:41:16,437
And also wanted to echo the getting the information out.

1124
01:41:16,717 --> 01:41:30,388
I heard from a neighbor who knows that I live here and they told me about this and that I have the fortune that I know some of the neighbors because I've been here for eight years now, but we have some newer neighbors that they aren't as networked in yet.

1125
01:41:30,508 --> 01:41:38,175
And so it would be really nice if they could more easily get the information that these meetings are going on and these plans are being made.

1126
01:41:39,095 --> 01:41:46,021
Then just a small comment about when the slave wall and all the other wall was being put in.

1127
01:41:48,663 --> 01:41:54,068
Again, on the subject of eyesores, there was a port-a-potty that was directly across the street from us.

1128
01:41:54,348 --> 01:41:57,110
Cars would stop and people would be using the port-a-potty.

1129
01:41:57,631 --> 01:42:02,274
It was there for months beyond when the work, or at least weeks beyond when the work was finished.

1130
01:42:02,375 --> 01:42:05,897
I don't know if the upcoming work is going to involve a port-a-potty, but just to

1131
01:42:06,738 --> 01:42:14,622
To put in the plug to maybe have that make sure that's managed well so that we, it doesn't need to be there for any longer than the work is going on.

1132
01:42:15,483 --> 01:42:17,844
And yeah, those are just the comments I wanted to make.

1133
01:42:17,904 --> 01:42:18,244
Thank you.

1134
01:42:18,824 --> 01:42:19,665
Thank you so much.

1135
01:42:20,425 --> 01:42:28,870
By the way, throughout there, whoever went around and stapled the meeting information to the.

1136
01:42:30,250 --> 01:42:39,597
power poles, thank you, that's how I actually found out about it, was actually walking my dog and someone had stapled the signage up on there, so thank you.

1137
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:47,843
Yeah, I heard about it from a neighbor too, from Diane actually, not from the city unfortunately.

1138
01:42:51,566 --> 01:42:55,909
Are there any other comments of anybody that would like to make tonight before we wrap it up?

1139
01:42:56,912 --> 01:43:14,290
No, but I, I, I do want to make a point if people have places that they go to for information, it would be superior that when you email us just just just tell us, you know, if you have a go to place, like, we did try to throw it up on next door and.

1140
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:19,572
Uh, you know, and there used to be years ago, there used to be, like, the Yahoo chat boards where everybody was on.

1141
01:43:19,672 --> 01:43:27,196
But, you know, if there's something like that now, we're happy to try to tap into those resources to make sure that we hit every available one.

1142
01:43:27,736 --> 01:43:37,041
And Jen, maybe we can try to, you know, if we get moving on design work or whatever, if we have another meeting, maybe you can go out on the tax bill and, you know, that will hit.

1143
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:37,941
At least the home.

1144
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:40,482
Yeah, I think I mean, I talked to Dennis about the water bill.

1145
01:43:40,542 --> 01:43:41,243
It's just hard.

1146
01:43:41,283 --> 01:43:43,083
Like you got to hit it right with the mail.

1147
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:53,047
And you know, it's, you know, unfortunately, we don't really have a budget, we have to work with the city to, to, you know, try to do a mailing.

1148
01:43:53,347 --> 01:43:57,929
So, but we hear you, and we'll see what we can do and make it try to make it work.

1149
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:02,191
And try to get is, you know, maybe we'll do some door door drops,

1150
01:44:02,491 --> 01:44:03,671
you can walk the neighborhood.

1151
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:08,352
We'll come up with some ideas and we really appreciate everybody's comments tonight.

1152
01:44:10,273 --> 01:44:15,074
And again, please email us at the commission if you have thoughts after this meeting.

1153
01:44:15,094 --> 01:44:19,395
This is not, certainly not the end of the process.

1154
01:44:19,415 --> 01:44:23,836
This is the beginning or the middle and we welcome comments.

1155
01:44:23,976 --> 01:44:29,718
If you'd like to be on our mailing list, please send us your, if you send us an email, we'll make sure that you're on our list.

1156
01:44:31,301 --> 01:44:34,489
And we're always open to feedback, comments, suggestions.

1157
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:37,357
So thank you as always.

1158
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:39,041
Thank you everybody for coming tonight.

1159
01:44:39,101 --> 01:44:44,696
Thank you for hanging in here for over 90 minutes and we will see you next time.

1160
01:44:44,857 --> 01:44:45,498
Thank you so much.

1161
01:44:45,559 --> 01:44:46,080
Have a good night.
