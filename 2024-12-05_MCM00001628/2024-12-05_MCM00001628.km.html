    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=149.076s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you, Jen, for that introduction, and I think Ryan's going to get the.
 Presentation up on the screen.
 Great.
 Thanks, Ryan.
 So everybody should be looking at just the title slide here.
 My name is Peter Headland, a landscape architect and a planner based in Arlington right next door.
 I was fortunate enough to work on the master plan project and have now been doing a little study on this concept design.
 And we'll talk about that shortly here.
 Okay, next slide.
 Great.
 The 2020 master plan, we started in 2019.
 It was almost a year process.
 It went through 2020.
 And that's all on the historical commission website.
 And at the end of that, we came up with a series of phased implementation projects that could happen over a period of
 20 years, and we'll talk about the first phase of that with the next slide.
 So this shows the first, say, seven of these implementation ideas that came out of the master plan, restoring the wall, the historic wall right on the edge of Grove Street.
 an archaeological dig at the estate, which has also taken place.
 We'll talk about that a little bit.
 Making improvements to the Grove Street edge, the fieldstone wall there.
 Those were in phase one and we'll go over those in a little bit.
 Other projects
 from the master planning include new crosswalks, improvements to the trails, some type of signage to identify the park, and some planting in this central planted LA.
 Okay, on the next slide, we'll talk about that.
 The first step and really the reason for this whole park is what's now known as Pomp's Wall.
 In 2019, the image on the upper left, that was the condition when we began the master plan and we had a historic masonry consultant, Richard Irons, come and maybe some of you heard him talk.
 He gave a presentation a number of years ago.
 He evaluated the wall.
 I wrote up a pretty detailed technical memo about the wall and went over some options to restore the wall.
 Some of you might know that a wall that part of the, in the deed when this part was given to the city of Medford, it stipulated that this wall, they were so proud of this wall, that this wall needed to be forever maintained.
 The preservation and restoration of this wall is really important or else technically, the old estate could take this part back over, but luckily, that's not going to happen.
 The middle slide there shows the previous joint conditions, pretty deteriorated and the capstone needed some significant repair.
 So, in the next slide, we show the process in 2023.
 Mason was hired to do that work.
 This is that restoration.
 A lot of the wall really had to be taken apart and put back together.
 And maybe some of you.
 were there or witnessed some of that progress.
 And the brick on the right side is pretty interesting.
 The contractor pulled that out and you can see a fingerprints on the top of that brick.
 So that's
 Pretty interesting, the wall was said to have been built in 1760, and so those are over 250 years old.
 Were they from Pompeii, the former enslaved person who built the wall?
 Perhaps Medford was known for local brick making and these bricks were sourced locally, but that's really sort of a neat glimpse of history and all those bricks went back into that wall.
 On the next slide, you can see the final result from last year of the newly restored wall with newly pointed bricks.
 They ended up putting a new cap on top of it to really seal that with flashing.
 Hopefully, this will last for the next few generations.
 Okay, so the next project that came out of the master plan in phase 1 was improving the Grove Street edge, the old field stone wall.
 It's an interesting historic image on the right hand side of the screen here, which shows it's looking up Grove Street.
 That is the
 historic wall, formerly known as the slave wall, now known as Pompe's wall.
 And you can see the wall as it was historically, but over time, it had sort of fallen apart in some areas more than others.
 The image on the left here is showing prior to the master plan, you know, the
 wall in this area was pretty gone, and so the thought there was to improve this fieldstone wall.
 And so the next slide shows the results of that.
 With the wall repaired, it really helps to define the edge of the park.
 Also, cutouts were left at intersections for crosswalks to access the park.
 And...
 Another part of that project was for five feet behind that wall, clearing out the understory, a lot of invasive plants have popped up in there.
 Clearing that out a little bit, let these big trees, you can see this one over on the right side, give them a little bit more room to grow.
 Ryan, at the end, we'll talk a little bit about some upcoming planting maintenance improvements.
 Okay, on the next slide, we talk about the third part of this first phase of projects coming out of the master plan, the archaeological dig at the estate.
 Here we see illustration of the Thomas Brooks house that was right behind that wall.
 This later colored here, that's that wall, that's Pomp's Wall.
 You can see the drive right behind it and what this house looked like.
 It was built in 1727.
 The house was demolished in 1860.
 Then it just really sat there because it was never redeveloped and became a park.
 The archaeologists we brought on for the master plan were determined, and they were correct, that this is a highly sensitive area for archaeological findings.
 And the master plan proposed an archaeological dig
 with a professional and to work collaboratively with community volunteers, and that happened.
 And they thought that there was the possibility to find, very good possibility to find both pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.
 And on the next slide, we see that dig, which happened in 2022 and 23.
 Maybe some people on this call, this Zoom meeting were part of that.
 You can see some of the people from the community along with the professionals working on that dig.
 There were 23 test pits and over 1,600 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 And post-contact and pre-contact mean either pre-contact is pre-colonial settlement and post-contact is after settlers arrived.
 So there was both interesting findings from both of those areas, which is pretty neat.
 And here's some of the things that were found.
 That piece of pottery was on that site.
 Okay, next slide please Ryan.
 So there is a pretty detailed survey report from the master plan that made some recommendations.
 They recommended to protect and preserve this site, specifically this estate site area.
 They thought it was a highly sensitive area in and around the house site, and that in this area, that any below ground disturbance should be avoided or ideally kept at a real minimum.
 And that will come into play when we talk about the concept for this area.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan.
 We see where that area is.
 This is the approximate house location.
 We're looking south on the dirt path.
 You can kind of see the back of Pomp's wall there.
 So that's generally where that house was.
 On the next slide, we have a couple images looking both south on that site.
 Some low vinca has grown up there.
 Maybe,
 A remnant from ground cover that was planted originally that could be possible.
 And then this is looking north.
 It was a pretty open site originally around that estate, but trees have have grown in over time.
 Okay, and the next slide.
 We see a couple other just context views of the north entrance.
 This is the newly reconstructed wall and the break in the wall at the roadway opposite.
 This is looking south on the south approach and you can see the open lawn there.
 These are the two ways that visitors would get to this area.
 Next slide.
 Okay, so we've been working for the last number of months and through a couple meetings on a design concept for this central area for this historically sensitive area, and I'll walk you through the main.
 Concepts here, and with the 3 big ideas for the design concept to improve accessibility to the park.
 And help identify the park as such as as a park and to make some of this really interesting history visible.
 I remember when I first started working on the master plan, and I.
 was out exploring the park, it's definitely not evident that it is or was a town-owned property.
 And so the improvements to the walls certainly help.
 And some simple signage will help to identify it as an important historical park for the town of Medford.
 So the first concept is a history wall.
 which is a, these paths really sort of already exist, they're dirt pathways, mostly, and creating a loop here in this thicker orange line that would help to connect
 a number of these historically sensitive areas and use historic markers to interpret the history a little bit.
 And we'll go through each of those.
 But these blue circles are those 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 markers there.
 Also, two potential areas for welcome signs to the park.
 We'll talk about the
 interpretation and stabilization measures around the former estate site.
 And you have to be able to get to the park, so new crosswalks and accessible parking.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan, we'll kind of walk through each of these.
 First is the history walk.
 The walk, again, in this thicker orange here, it would be an accessible path in terms of slope and surfacing.
 We haven't done a detailed, there hasn't been a detailed field survey done of this area of the park, but we think that it can be an accessible path below 5% slope.
 And we'd like to connect that to new crosswalks so people from this community, or maybe who are parking there could get into this park.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 There are 2 potential areas for welcome signs, and Ryan will talk a little bit more about this at the end.
 It would be great to identify the park, to name it, and to welcome visitors, to make them feel welcome.
 So here, opposite Jackson Road or potentially Ravine Road to the north are 2 potential areas for welcome signs.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 just a little bit history about Thomas Brooks Park.
 This is 1860 Brooks estate plan, which was pretty big.
 A lot of this land has since been given to the city of Medford.
 Our little sliver right there is Thomas Brooks Park.
 You can tell it's this almost like sharp triangle.
 Up on the upper right is
 at H.F.
 Walling Plan from 1855.
 And here we see our park there.
 It's easy to identify the railroad, which is this diagonal line, and then Grove Street.
 And so that sliver right there is what the future park looked like in 1855.
 It is adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.
 And then the six-acre park was conveyed to the city in 1924, again, with the stipulation that the
 brick wall, now known as Pomp's Wall, be forever maintained.
 On the next slide, we talk about these historic markers.
 Originally, in earlier iteration, this walk was just a linear path from here to here.
 But then as we took some feedback and evolved it a little bit, it's become more of a loop.
 Pomp's wall is right here just to orient everyone.
 It's great.
 And Grove Street is right here.
 So the proposal is to have a series of five simple historic markers so that visitors to the site would help to understand the rich history here a little bit better.
 Both the Native American history,
 which marker could be there, the African American history with this pretty remarkable wall, Pomp's Wall, that's just been restored.
 There's a pretty fascinating history of water systems and the Middlesex Canal here, and
 This is an appropriate place for that historic marker because it looks out over this lawn.
 We'll talk about that in a little bit.
 And then on the back of the park here, you're right next to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, now known as the MBTA Lowell Branch Railroad.
 which also has a rich history, and then coming around to the colonial American history of the site and the sort of remains of the Thomas Brooke estate and thinking about how to interpret and mark that.
 Okay, so over the next handful of slides, we move to the next one, we'll talk about how to do that and why that's important.
 So the Native American historic marker, again, with the archaic,
 I have a hard time saying that word today.
 With the dig that was just done, there were 64 pre-contact artifacts found collected during the 22-23 dig, which is pretty neat.
 Maybe some community members on this call or in this picture, I don't know.
 Largely, the items that were found were chipping debris and pottery shards.
 presumably from the middle to late Woodlands period, 2000 to 450 years ago.
 So pretty significant historical resource.
 And this has a potential for rich Native American history, given the proximity of water resources and the
 topography.
 So that's pretty invisible now, but it'd be great to make that history a little bit more visible, just with a simple interpretive marker.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we talk about Pomp's Wall.
 Okay, the existing marker, which is there, if you want to
 Sneak on the edge of the roadway and or peek at it from your car is shown on the upper right there.
 This upper left is a historic photo, which the date is unknown of, and the photo in the middle is from 1899.
 So you can look up Grove Street.
 You can see the wall, it's beginning to get overgrown there, but pretty open behind it, some of the big trees there.
 We know the wall was constructed around 1760, that the city is required to preserve and forever maintain it in that deed.
 to the city, it stipulates that.
 And then there was this recent, very important restoration and renaming of the wall.
 So that's an important history to help make visible.
 Okay, if we go to the next slide, we can help to mark in a way the importance of the Medford water systems.
 This picture on the left is a little hard to see.
 All these slides will be posted on the
 Historical Commission website.
 And if you look on there, there's a lot of information from the past number of years from all the studies and meetings that were done.
 This is a plaque elsewhere in Medford that shows the Middlesex Canal and the route.
 Our little park
 is right here.
 You can see the railroad and Grove Street.
 And so this Middlesex Canal was right to the south of this area.
 The Middlesex Canal was around from 1793 to 1853, ran from Charlestown to Lowell.
 It was partly financed by the Brooks family, which has such a prominent role.
 in the city of Medford.
 It supplied much of the lumber for shipbuilding in Medford.
 That was such a big industry in the city.
 On the lower right is an image of one of the bridges.
 There were a number of
 bridges, 50 bridges, all along the canal.
 And this was one in Medford that was taken down.
 But we think that some of these blocks were used in this Grove Street field stone wall, especially south of Pomp's Wall.
 You can go look and the stones there are more cut in.
 rectilinear blocks.
 I can't get into a lot of it here, but there's really a fascinating study that the head of the MWRA did on the role of Medford in the whole water and sewer development for the city of Boston in the nearby area.
 It's pretty fascinating.
 area where we're proposing this historic marker looking out on that field, well part of the reason the field is there and it's not overgrown is because there's a sewer easement that actually runs through there.
 And so there's a lot of interesting things to talk about for a potential historic marker talking about these water systems and the task will be how to distill this information in a concise way.
 Okay.
 If we go to the next slide, I talked a little bit about the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the proposals for historic marker on the backside of Thomas Brooks Park, talking about this, that this railroad was constructed in 1835.
 Also,
 partly financed by the Brooks family, the people didn't really want the railroad to happen, especially the people who were invested in the canal because the railroad made the canal not as necessary.
 And it essentially replaced the canal in order to speed up.
 Transportation provide year-round freight transportation because the canal would freeze in the winter.
 This railroad, it was the first major railroad in the state, one of the first in the whole Northeast, and it's still used today.
 It's an active rail line as the MBTA Lowell line.
 That's an image on the bottom right.
 You can see Boston and Lowell there.
 Okay, and Ryan, if you go to the next slide, the last historic marker kind of gets back to what we started with, with the dig on the site.
 Now, this is an image of the Brooks Estate House, and the historic marker would help to reinterpret that or interpret that history.
 that this house was built in 1727, you can see here there was a little curved driveway behind that brick wall.
 And that's essentially where, if you walk out there, where that dirt footpath is and where that history walk would be.
 Then you can see the brick wall between the street and the driveway, that's the palms wall.
 We know historically it was noted that there were three black walnut trees in front of the house.
 You can see them in this illustration and also those original trees aren't there.
 But if you're out there in that park, there are black walnut trees that are descendants, I think, of these original trees.
 Then as we know, there are a lot of artifacts recovered.
 from the dig over 1600 from the post-contact or colonial era.
 Okay, on the next slide, we looked at this site.
 This is the general area of that estate house, and the proposal is to both protect and preserve and interpret this site a little bit by marking the
 Corners of where the house was with simple stone blocks and stabilizing the surface with low plantings.
 And then this would be the blue circle that historic marker, which would be able to interpret it.
 So, if you go to the next slide.
 This was one of the site precedents that we looked at, Robbins Farm Park.
 It's a neat park right next door to Medford, up on the top of the hill.
 There's an old farm there.
 It was given to the city, turned into a park, and maybe probably 10 years or so ago,
 Park and Recreation Commission wanted to sort of memorialize the house in the former farm there.
 And so they put, they marked the foundation here with these stone blocks.
 These are kind of similar to what we're thinking for Thomas Brooks Park.
 And they had a simple sign in their case, it was right on the block.
 In our case, maybe it would be a separate standing element as a way to
 Talk about the former farmhouse that was there and give people a sense of that history a little bit.
 Okay, on the next slide we have another site that's interpreted the historic history, tracing the foundations of historic house.
 This is the Governor Winthrop House in Charleston, the great house site where they used found stones and some foundation stones and brought those to the surface and
 Trace that foundation there and then just a simple lawn is a very different setting their more urban area and more extensive historic sign that you can see on the bottom right.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 We also would like to stabilize the surface in a very simple way with ground cover planting.
 There's already a little bit of that there with a vinca that's taken over, naturalized the site a little bit.
 And on the next slide, we'd like to add to that a little bit with a nice native plant, gold star.
 It's native, shade-tolerant, a lot of trees around, pretty low, 6-12 inches tall, and has a nice bloom from the late spring into the fall.
 You can imagine walking on this path and coming across these blocks and a little burst of flowers might be a pretty elegant, beautiful, but yet subtle way to think about this site.
 On the next slide, we talked about another way that we could use plants to bring back the history.
 This is Syringa vulgaris, a common lilac, which is for hundreds of years been part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 And the quote on the bottom here is from the
 Medford paper in 1912, that some of the historic research which the state did, which predated the master plan, they pulled together, and I'll just read the quote, beside the street, Grove Street, and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 So they're talking about Palm's Wall and they're talking about Grove Street, which by the looks of this was originally bordered with lilac.
 So wouldn't it be neat, the upper right image is of the Arnold Arboretum on Lilac Sunday.
 Pro tip, that's a great place to go.
 Amazingly,
 blooms in the middle of May.
 We'd like to bring those lilacs back at the wall.
 On the next slide, we can see a picture of the wall.
 This is looking right up Grove Street and Palm's wall over on the right hand side with a field stone wall next to it.
 And on the next slide, just a little illustration of what some lilacs would look like right behind that wall.
 It would look pretty nice for vehicles or people on the sidewalk over on the other side here.
 It's a nice southern orientation there, southwest orientation.
 So I think those lilacs would do well.
 And at the same time, we could plant some, just a low ground cover on the roadside to help stabilize that embankment there.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we have a look at the existing conditions behind Pompe's wall and up that path so this would be the history walk and then the next slide shows a little illustration of
 what that might look like with some lilacs over on the side in this simple walkway that would then loop around with a series of historic markers and then the stone blocks at the estate house to give a deeper understanding of the rich history of this site.
 Okay, on the next slide, I believe we're hopping into some information Ryan from the historical commission can share on the upcoming improvements for the second phase at the park.

 好吧，现在我只想快速深入了解第二阶段的构建更新。
 因此，重申一下 Jen 在开头所说的，我们有 2020 年总体规划，但该文件是一份动态文件，可能会发生变化。
 这将会发展。
 因此，无论总体规划中有什么内容，我相信你们中的一些人已经读过，我们使用的分期与施工中所需的分期不同。
 因此，对于这个资助阶段，完全得益于社区保护委员会的慷慨资助，我们打算进行更大规模的考古挖掘，我们打算根据《美国残疾人法案》的要求修剪一些树木并清除枯木，
 通往路边切口、人行道和停车位的建筑通道。
 我们试图通过标记和张贴一些标志来识别十字路口，然后，当然，我们试图将这个地方识别为公园。
 有几件事正在考虑中。
 当然，我们正在关注彼得刚才谈到的这个考古前沿，它正处于早期规划阶段。
 当然，我们正在考虑诸如改善步道清晰度、添加适合场地的树木以及在植树时进行一些灌木修剪和侵入式割草等措施。
 但当然，没有考虑到什么，我们很久以前在公众会议上就听说过，现在我们听到，即使在总体规划中，我们也没有以任何方式考虑社区花园或铁路桥。
 所以我要把这个放在一边，这样人们就知道我们正在考虑的是对公园影响较小的事情，好吗？
 因此，对于考古学，我们打算聘请一位考古学家来探索托马斯·布鲁克斯故居的遗址以及居住在那里的人们，包括布鲁克斯家族及其雇用的员工。
 这是一个鲜为人知的话题，但已被探索过。
 该遗址与新英格兰的奴隶制有很多联系，因此它是一个非常重要的地方。
 所以，在做出任何限制之前
 为了永久保护该遗址，我们希望完成对此事的考古尽职调查。
 我们将寻找社区志愿者，就像上次一样，我们可以让人帮助我们筛选土壤和对文物进行实验室工作，以便人们可以看到它们。
 所以我们一定会为此努力。
 我们考古部分的工作将是我们希望在两者之间设置的限制
 你知道，佩德罗的历史之旅以及对房子和解释面板的解释以及所有这些都是为了保护这个网站免受任何负面影响。
 有很多树木修剪工作要做。
 为此，我们正在研究与该地点 50 棵树龄约 150 年的树木相关的最直接问题。
 其中，保存状况较好的古树有30株。
 他们需要修剪，就像修剪灯一样，只是为了去除一些枯枝，一些领导者折断了，但有10
 公园内和周围的树木完全死了。
 您可以在右侧看到这张图片，其中他们的领导人完全分裂，什么都没有留下，为了公共安全，这些树必须被移除。
 在其他图像中，例如最左边的图像，您可以看到领导者已经分开并摇摇欲坠地悬挂在一些小路上。
 所以我们正在寻找
 将它们全部修剪，使婴儿围栏从一端到另一端都牢固。
 还有两棵入侵的挪威枫树已经完全死亡。
 它们高耸于这个地方。
 他们身高约20英尺，但只有15岁。
 我们希望将其移除，因为任何大小如此之大的树都会造成滋扰，并且会绕过 MBT​​A 的通行权。
 但随着树木的修剪，
 我们希望种植 15 棵新树。
 我说的是橡树，但与城市树木管理员交谈时，它可能是橡树，也可能是糖枫树，这些树原产于新英格兰，也原产于这个地方，我们希望取代这里的入侵性挪威枫树，我们有计划继续种植可以治愈的树木，可以这么说，以便公园成为一个公园并保持森林的感觉。
 现在，作为该项目的一部分，最重要的关键部分之一是我们希望清除整个场地中的所有死木。
 所以我们知道，当格罗夫街发生冰暴时，一些枯木被从街上移走。
 DPW 破坏了这一点。
 让我们完成这项工作吧。
 当然，出于公共安全原因，在隔离墙期间也砍伐了几棵树。
 所有这些都将被消除。
 然后，所有即将死亡或死去的历史树木的各种树便将从公园的一端移至另一端。
 所以这将是一次从上到下的彻底清洁。
 大部分此类材料如果太大，将会从网站上删除。
 如果再小一点的话
 它可以被压碎，我们会将其中一些放回到道路上，这样道路上就有了一些定义。
 为了改善无障碍环境，我们在整个公园内分布了多个设施。
 最重要的是，我们将重新连接格罗夫街东侧的人行道（目前终止于牛顿街）至杰克逊路的新入口。
 我们将在所有墙壁开口处切割人行道。
 Jackson Road、Gravine Road和Layard Road将设有条纹人行道。
 人行横道处将设有指示牌。
 当然，所有这一切都需要很长时间，因为有很多重要的参与者。
 所以我们正在探索和研究设计和概念，但是当我们开始推进这个项目时，城市的公共工程部门、交通部门都必须介入。
 所以我们才刚刚开始，还有很多很多个月的时间。
 但我们希望也许能在 2025 年春季开始施工，这样我们就可以基本上以正确的方式开始新的一年，并在冬季后的第一个可能的施工期间，我们将开始并交付我们已经工作了一年多的这些东西。
 为了获得空间，它们需要在附近的某个地方标记为无障碍路线和公园周围无障碍路径的一部分，即一个停车位。
 当我们最初制定总体规划时，我们被要求禁止汽车进入公园。
 因此，我们必须在某处提供 ADA 无障碍空间。
 我们将与居民以及你们所有人合作，尝试将其安置在一个对无障碍路线和居民都方便的位置。
 但它还要求该市与交通部门举行公开听证会。
 因此，将会有很多很多的机会来解决这个空间适合什么地方以及如何适合的问题。
 当然，
 想法改变了。
 有访问权。
 这并不可取，但如有必要，我们可以将停车位移回原位。
 对于人行道标记，我们希望保持简单。
 你知道，一条简单的油漆人行道就可以了。
 标牌尽量减少。
 前几天我们和交通部门谈过。
 也许人们更喜欢明亮的标志（如果有的话），那就是杰克逊路。
 那里有大量人群集中穿过公园的正门，这甚至可能是居民上下学的安全路线。
 但根据我们听到的反馈，这有待讨论。
 然后是公园标牌。有两种不同类型的公园标牌。
 有欢迎您参加历史之旅的标牌和解说标牌。
 但实际上，在这个阶段，我们试图将公园识别为公园。
 我们希望在同一条街上有类似布鲁克斯庄园标志的东西。
 该网站与
 归布鲁克斯庄园所有，但可能有自己的身份。
 所以我们还没有真正的设计，但我们确实有一些东西可以将其标识为具有一定历史的城市公园，以便每个人都知道它不仅仅是一片废弃的森林，它实际上是梅德福的一个重要场所。
 当然，通过持续的规划，我们正在考虑将一些事情作为该项目的一部分，这些事情将导致其他项目。
 我们有关于树木的历史工作。
 有一次，我们想打开一条种满橡树和黑胡桃木的小巷。
 或许可以减少一些入侵的挪威枫树。
 但我们正在倾听，我们了解到目前植被的作用就像一种声幕。
 因此，作为其中的一部分，我们会讨论种植一些树木，以便随着现有景观的缩小，更大、更合适的树木可以增加尺寸。
 并且这个声音缓冲区始终被维护。
 但同样，这是后期阶段，有很多很多很多淘汰。
 但最大的问题是，正在进行的一些树木修复工作将减轻对 MBTA 围栏的损坏。
 因此，我们将让 MBTA 与我们合作修复围栏，确保公园安全，最终确保没有人能够跨越铁道床。
 这就是我们第二阶段工作的核心。
 所以我们知道您有意见和问题。
 因此，我认为如果您想发表评论或对我们有任何疑问，我们很乐意回答。
 我们只是要求人们举手。
 当然，今晚没有必要发表所有评论。
 这并不是一切的结束。
 我们将尽力继续考古实地工作，这不是
 除了出于安全原因进行挖掘、封顶和一些树木工作之外，对公园有任何影响，但其余工作将在六个月内再次完成该项目，因此，如果您知道稍后会出现问题，并且如果您想花一些时间消化今晚听到的内容并将其放入其中，我们将接受评论并很高兴收到电子邮件
 当然，正如我在会议开始时所说，如果我们没有您的电子邮件，如果您不在我们的联系人列表中，请向我们发送电子邮件，我们将很乐意将您添加到我们的电子邮件和广告中。</p>

 នេះនឹងបន្តកាន់តែអាក្រក់ទៅៗ។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាក៏ដោយ សូមអរគុណ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាវានឹងល្អ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំពិតជាចង់មើលការចូលដោយសុវត្ថិភាព និងការពិតដែលថាផ្លូវ Grove ពិតជាគ្រោះថ្នាក់ណាស់។
 មនុស្សបើកលឿនណាស់នៅលើផ្លូវនេះ។
 សូមអរគុណ</p>

 ខ្ញុំក៏រស់នៅផ្លូវ Grove ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំអាចឮអ្នកយ៉ាងច្បាស់។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយជាមួយ John Ardizzone ព្រោះខ្ញុំឃើញអ្នកលើកដៃ ខ្ញុំបានឃើញពីមុន ហើយខ្ញុំដឹងថាអ្នកមិនប្រើដៃរបស់អ្នកនៅលើ Zoom ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែព្យាយាមបញ្ឈប់អ្នកពីការលើកដៃរបស់អ្នក។
 ដូច្នេះ ចន ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់ចេញ ហើយយើងអាចយកឈ្មោះ និងអាសយដ្ឋានរបស់អ្នកដើម្បីចុះឈ្មោះ សូមទាក់ទងមកយើងខ្ញុំ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3147.976s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: John Art រស់នៅ 53 Johnson Avenue ត្រឹមតែ 30 ឆ្នាំប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​រឿង​ទាំង​មូល​អំពី​ឧទ្យាន​នេះ។
 ខ្ញុំជាម្ចាស់លេខ 69 Grove Street ។
 អ្នកជួលរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺដាវីឌ។
 មនុស្ស​កំពុង​ឆ្លង​កាត់​ផ្លូវ​ឡាន​របស់​ខ្ញុំ​ដើម្បី​ទៅ​សួន​ច្បារ ហើយ​នោះ​មិន​មែន​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​នឹង​កើត​ឡើង​នោះ​ទេ។
 វាគួរតែបិទ។
 វាគ្រាន់តែជាសំណួរប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 បញ្ហាមួយទៀតគឺនៅពេលដែលអ្នករកលុយបានច្រើន ផ្លូវនោះមានចរាចរណ៍ច្រើន ហើយអ្នកមានចរាចរណ៍កាន់តែច្រើនឡើងៗ។
 រឿងមួយទៀតគឺថាយើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីមនុស្សនាំកុមារ។
 តាមបច្ចេកទេសនេះគឺជាសួនឆ្កែ។
 ខ្ញុំជាម្នាក់ក្នុងចំណោមពួកគេ ហើយខ្ញុំបាននៅទីនេះយូរជាងអ្នកផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុងរូបថតនេះ។
 ពេត្រុស រីយ៉ាន អ្នកណាក៏មកដែរ។
 ពួកគេមិននៅទីនោះដរាបណាខ្ញុំនៅ។
 ខ្ញុំនៅទីនោះ នៅពេលដែលវាជាសួនជ័យជំនះ និងសួនសហគមន៍។
 ស្រស់ស្អាតខ្លាំងណាស់
 អ្វី​ដែល​អ្នក​កំពុង​តែ​និយាយ​គឺ​ថា​ពេល​ដែល​ពួក​គេ​បាន​សង់​ជញ្ជាំង​ពួក​គេ​បាន​បំផ្លាញ​ឈើ​ទាំង​អស់​ដែល​នៅ​ខាង​ក្រោយ​ជញ្ជាំង​។
 អ្នក​ដែល​សង់​ជញ្ជាំង​ត្រូវ​លើក​វា​យ៉ាង​ប្រយ័ត្នប្រយែង​ដូច​គេ​ធ្វើ​នៅ​ខាង​លើ​ផ្សារ​ទំនើប។
 បុរសទាំងនេះគ្រាន់តែវាយវាចេញ។
 ពួក​គេ​បាន​ធ្វើ​ដុំ​ថ្ម។
 រឿងមួយទៀតគឺអ្នកបាននិយាយថាចក្ខុវិស័យរបស់អ្នកគឺមានភាពរសើបខ្លាំងណាស់។
 ពួកគេបានយកថ្មកម្ពស់ពី 5 ទៅ 10 3/4 អ៊ីញពីយានដ្ឋានរបស់ខ្ញុំ បំបែកវា ហើយបោះវាទៅក្នុងសួនច្បារ។
 មិនអីទេ?
 ថ្ម​នេះ​គួរ​ប្រើ​ជា​គ្រឹះ​សម្រាប់​សង់​ជញ្ជាំង​ដ៏​ស្រស់​ស្អាត​នេះ។
 ពួកគេមិនដែលប្រើថ្មប្រភេទណាមួយឡើយ។
 ពេល​ធ្វើ​រួច​ក៏​ចូល​មក​កាន់​ប៉ែល ហើយ​សំប៉ែត​គ្រប់​យ៉ាង។
 ខ្ញុំធ្វើការក្នុងតំបន់។
 ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការក្នុងវិស័យនេះអស់រយៈពេល 30 ឆ្នាំមកហើយ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងពីរឿងរបស់គាត់។
 អ្នកកំពុងនិយាយអំពីប្រឡាយ និងការជីកកកាយបុរាណវិទ្យា។
 ទីក្រុង ទីក្រុង​នៅ​ទីនោះ​កាប់​បំផ្លាញ​កន្លែង​នោះ​អស់​ជា​ច្រើន​ឆ្នាំ​មក​ហើយ។
 ផ្លូវ Grove ធ្លាប់ស្ងប់ស្ងាត់ណាស់។
 ឥឡូវនេះ អ្វីដែលអ្នកត្រូវធ្វើគឺស្តាប់សំឡេងរថភ្លើង ពេលកំពុងសម្អាតសំរាមជុំវិញថ្មទាំងនេះ។
 អ្នកត្រូវតែចូលទៅកាត់ 20 ហ្វីតនៅពីក្រោយជញ្ជាំងនោះ ហើយគោះជញ្ជាំងទាំងអស់នៅទីនោះ។
 ពួកគេមិនបានចាប់ផ្តើមតាមរបៀបនោះទេ។
 ពេល​ដែល​គេ​ចាប់​ផ្ដើម​សាង​សង់​ស្ពាន គេ​បាន​ធ្វើ​ឲ្យ​វា​ស្អាត និង​ស្អាត។
 ដំបូងពួកគេថែមទាំងប្រើថ្មទៀតផង។
 ខ្ញុំធ្វើការនៅក្នុងឧស្សាហកម្មសំណង់។
 ខ្ញុំដឹង
 នៅពេលដែលអ្នកទៅដល់មួយភាគបីនៃផ្លូវនៅទីនោះ កុំភ្លេចអំពីថ្ម។
 ភ្លេចដើរក្នុងព្រៃ។
 ពួកគេគ្រាន់តែបំផ្លាញអ្វីៗទាំងអស់។
 វា​ជា​ភាព​វឹកវរ​ឥឡូវ​នេះ។
 អ្វីដែលអ្នកត្រូវធ្វើគឺសម្អាតឧទ្យាន។
 ស្រវឹង​ជោកជាំ​ចង់​យក​កាបូប​លុយ​ប្រជាពលរដ្ឋ។
 ប៉ុន្តែបញ្ហាគឺមនុស្សទាំងអស់នេះកំពុងនិយាយអំពីថាតើវាអស្ចារ្យប៉ុណ្ណា។
 ពួកគេមិននៅក្បែរនោះទេ។
 នេះមិនប៉ះពាល់ដល់ពួកគេទេ។
 អ្នកបានបើកផ្លូវមួយ។
 មិត្តរបស់ខ្ញុំ Mike David ប្រពន្ធរបស់គាត់គឺជាក្មួយស្រីរបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 មាននរណាម្នាក់ដើរឆ្កែរបស់ពួកគេនៅទីនោះនៅម៉ោង 10 យប់។
 មិនមានកុមារទេ ហើយកុមារតែម្នាក់គត់ដែលលេងនៅក្នុងសួននេះ រស់នៅក្នុងផ្ទះក្បែរ 69 Grove ។
 ពួកគេនៅទីនោះ ពួកគេជាក្មេងវាយកូនគោល។
 មិនមានក្មេងៗនៅទីនោះទេ វាជាសួនឆ្កែ។
 អីយ៉ា ទាំងអស់នេះគឺឆ្កួត។
 អ្នក​កំពុង​តែ​និយាយ​អំពី​កន្លែង​ដ៏​អស្ចារ្យ​មួយ​ដែល​អ្នក​ចង់​រក្សា​អនាម័យ​និង​របៀប​រៀបរយ។
 អ្នក​បាន​ចោល​លាមក​ឆ្កែ​អស់​រយៈពេល​សាមសិប​ឆ្នាំ​មក​ហើយ។
 គ្មាន​នរណា​ដឹង​ពី​ប្រវត្តិ​នៃ​អចលនទ្រព្យ​នោះ​ទេ។
 អ្នក​កំពុង​និយាយ​អំពី​ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ​អំពី​ប្រទេស។
 ខ្សែផ្គត់ផ្គង់ទឹករដ្ឋ Massachusetts ឆ្លងកាត់វា។
 នៅជិតផ្ទះខ្ញុំមាន MBTA ច្រើន។
 ខ្ញុំជាសហអ្នកនិពន្ធពិតប្រាកដតែមួយគត់នៃអចលនទ្រព្យនេះ។
 អ្នកមិនដែលព្រមានខ្ញុំទេ។
 ដូចហេតុអ្វី?
 ខ្ញុំបាននិយាយជាមួយនាយកដ្ឋានដឹកជញ្ជូន។
 តើអ្នកអាចដាក់ផ្លូវបំបែកនៅចុងផ្លូវរបស់ខ្ញុំបានទេ?
 ដូច្នេះតើមានអ្វីកើតឡើងនៅពេលដែលនរណាម្នាក់បោះបង់ចោល?
 បើ​ងាក​មក​ដល់​ផ្លូវ​ឆ្លង​វិញ​ម្ដង។
 លុះត្រាតែមានតម្រូវការផ្សេង ផ្លូវឆ្លងកាត់ត្រូវស្ថិតនៅចម្ងាយ 120 ហ្វីតនៃអគារដែលមានស្រាប់។
 គាត់មិនត្រូវការវាទេ។
 តើអ្នកអាចដើរបានទេ? តើអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាអាចដើរបានទេ? តើពួកគេទៅណា?
 អ្នក​កំពុង​និយាយ ហើយ​អ្នក​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​និយាយ​ថា​វា​ជា​កន្លែង​តែ​មួយ​គត់​សម្រាប់​កុមារ។
 Medford មានកន្លែងបៃតងច្រើនជាង។
 កូនប្រុសរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺជាសត្វព្រៃ។
 រុករកកន្លែងបៃតងទាំងអស់ដែលទីក្រុងមានផ្តល់ជូន។
 យើង​មាន​កន្លែង​បៃតង​ច្រើន​ទៀត​នៅ Medford, Mystic Lake និង Brooks Estates។
 ត្រូវតែមានដី 100 ហិចតានៅខាងក្រោយ។
 អ្នកត្រូវឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវដើម្បីទៅដល់ទីធ្លាបៃតង។
 មនុស្សដែលរស់នៅក្នុង West Medford មានសំណាងណាស់។
 ជាលទ្ធផលពួកគេបំផ្លាញវាដោយធ្វើដូច្នេះ។
 ចូលហើយសម្អាតឧទ្យាន។
 ច្រកចូលរបស់ខ្ញុំ ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកមិនបញ្ចប់វា?
 អ្នក​សង់​ជញ្ជាំង សង់​ចិញ្ចើម​ផ្លូវ រើស​វា​ហើយ​បញ្ជូន​មនុស្ស​ទៅ​ថ្ងៃ​ស្អែក ដើម្បី​បញ្ចប់​ជញ្ជាំង។
 ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកមិនធ្វើវា?
 អ្នក​គិត​ថា​ប្រសិន​បើ​អ្នក​នៅ​ផ្សារ​ទំនើប 69 ហើយ​មាន​នរណា​ម្នាក់​បាន​បុក​រថយន្ត​របស់​អ្នក​ខណៈ​ពេល​ដែល​អ្នក​កំពុង​ដើរ​ចេញ​នោះ​អ្នក​នឹង​ឆ្កួត​។
 នៅម៉ោង 10 យប់មាននរណាម្នាក់កំពុងដើរឆ្កែរបស់ពួកគេ។
 វា​មិន​មែន​នៅ​ក្នុង​ផ្ទះ​របស់​អ្នក​ទេ ដូច្នេះ​វា​នឹង​មិន​រំខាន​អ្នក​ទេ។
 មាននរណាម្នាក់រស់នៅលើផ្លូវ Jackson, Tyler និង John ។
 គ្មាន​មនុស្ស​ទាំង​នេះ​ស្នាក់​នៅ​ទី​នោះ​ទេ ដរាប​ណា​ខ្ញុំ​ធ្វើ។
 ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ទៅ​ទី​នោះ​ហើយ​មិន​ដែល​មាន​បញ្ហា​ទេ។
 សង្កាត់ដ៏ស្រស់ស្អាត។
 ព្រៃ​នេះ​ស្អាត​ជាង​ឥឡូវ​ទៅ​ទៀត។
 អ្នកមិនបានការពារពួកគេប៉ុន្មានឆ្នាំមកនេះទេ។
 ម្តងម្កាល អ្នកកាត់ស្មៅ។
 ការបើកនេះ ច្រកចូលនេះគឺជាការបើកតូចមួយ។
 អ្វី​ដែល​កើត​ឡើង​គឺ​គេ​យក​ថ្ម​ធំ​ចេញ​ដើម្បី​ឲ្យ​គេ​ដាក់​ម៉ាស៊ីន​កាត់​ស្មៅ​នៅ​ទី​នោះ។
 នោះហើយជារបៀបដែលវាបានចាប់ផ្តើមទាំងអស់។
 ខ្ញុំបានកាន់កាប់ផ្ទះនេះតាំងពីឆ្នាំ 2003 ហើយបានរស់នៅ Johnson Avenue អស់រយៈពេល 30 ឆ្នាំ។
 ខ្ញុំទើបតែលក់ផ្ទះរបស់ខ្ញុំ ប៉ុន្តែនៅតែជាម្ចាស់ហាងលក់គ្រឿងទេសចំនួន 69 ។
 ខ្ញុំបានទាក់ទងរួចហើយ។
 នាយកដ្ឋានចរាចរណ៍កំពុងមក។
 ពួកគេមិនចង់បានបញ្ហាទេ។
 យើងមិនដែលមានបញ្ហាអ្វីនៅលើផ្លូវ Johnson Blvd ទេ។
 ផ្នែកមួយទៀតនៃ Johnson Avenue ដែលហាងលក់គ្រឿងទេសបានជួបត្រូវបានបំផ្លាញ។
 ពួកគេបានបំផ្លាញតំបន់នោះ។
 មិនដែលមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់អ្វីនៅទីនោះទេ។

 យើងអាចប្រើចរាចរណ៍ ដើម្បីព្យាយាមបន្ថែមចរាចរណ៍ផ្សេងទៀត។
 រឿងមួយទៀតដែលយើងពិភាក្សាជាមួយពួកគេគឺប្រហែលជាបង្កើតតំបន់សុវត្ថិភាពនៅគែមឧទ្យាន ដូច្នេះល្បឿនកំណត់នឹងលែងមានល្បឿន 25 គីឡូម៉ែត្រក្នុងមួយម៉ោងពេញទីក្រុង។ ដូចជា 20 ម៉ាយក្នុងមួយម៉ោង។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​យើង​ដឹង​ថា​មនុស្ស​បើក​ល្បឿន​លើ​ផ្លូវ​នេះ ការ​មើល​ឃើញ​គឺ​ជា​បញ្ហា ហើយ​មនុស្ស​មួយ​ចំនួន​ចង់​បន្ថយ​ល្បឿន​ដើម្បី​រក្សា​សុវត្ថិភាព។
 យើងដឹងថាវាជាផ្លូវកាត់ដើម្បីទៅដល់កន្លែងជាក់លាក់។
 ខ្ញុំបានបើកឡានមកទីនេះដោយខ្លួនឯងពីផ្នែកផ្សេងទៀតនៃ Medford ប៉ុន្តែប្រហែលជាការសុំឱ្យមនុស្សបន្ថយល្បឿននឹងធ្វើឱ្យវាមានសុវត្ថិភាពជាង។
 ប្រហែលជាសូម្បីតែប្រើវាជាមួយនឹងសញ្ញាមួយអាចជួយបាន។
 ធ្វើឱ្យវាមានសុវត្ថិភាពបន្តិច។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​បើ​យើង​អាច​សង់​ស្ពាន​អាកាស​បាន យើង​នឹង​ធ្វើ។
 ប៉ុន្តែក្រៅពីនោះ យើងនឹងធ្វើផ្ទុយពីនេះ ហើយត្រូវប្រាកដថាផ្លូវឡើងអាចចូលបានទាំងសងខាង។</p>

 ខ្ញុំរស់នៅ 11 Newton Street, One House Inn ឆ្លងកាត់សួនច្បារ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាខ្ញុំយល់ស្របជាមួយនឹងវាគ្មិនទាំងអស់នៅទីនេះ យ៉ាងហោចណាស់ក្នុងន័យខ្លះ ដែលជាការអរគុណអ្នកខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់សុន្ទរកថានេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ការ​ចាប់​អារម្មណ៍ និង​មោទនភាព​ដែល​យើង​មើល​ទៅ​លើ​ប្រវត្តិ​របស់ Medford ហើយ​គិត​យ៉ាង​ស៊ី​ជម្រៅ​អំពី​វា។
 ដូច្នេះ​សូម​អរគុណ​ចំពោះ​ការ​ធ្វើ​កិច្ចការ​នេះ។
 ដូចចន ខ្ញុំអាចនិយាយបានថា ខ្ញុំគិតថាអារម្មណ៍នៃសហគមន៍គឺសំខាន់។
 ខ្ញុំមានអារម្មណ៍ថា ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំមិនបានជាវព្រឹត្តិបត្រព័ត៌មានរបស់អ្នក ហើយមិនចាប់អារម្មណ៍លើប្រធានបទនោះ ខ្ញុំមិនបានដឹងអំពីការប្រជុំនៅយប់នេះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​មាន​អ្នក​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ​ជា​ច្រើន​ក្នុង​សហគមន៍​ដែល​មិន​ដឹង​ថា​ការ​សម្រេច​ចិត្ត​កំពុង​ត្រូវ​បាន​ធ្វើ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ដឹង​ថា​វា​ជា​អក្សរ​ទេ​។
 នៅពេលអ្នកក្រឡេកមើលសហគមន៍នេះតាមទស្សនៈរបស់ John ខ្ញុំមិនគិតថាមានតម្លាភាពច្រើនក្នុងការសម្រេចចិត្ត ហើយមានការយកចិត្តទុកដាក់ច្រើន។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3777.742s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: តើ​ខ្ញុំ​អាច​រំខាន​បាន​លឿន ហើយ​សួរ​សំណួរ​ទស្សនិកជន​បាន​ទេ?
 សម្រាប់អ្នកនៅទីនោះ តើអ្នកណាខ្លះបានទទួលការហៅទូរសព្ទទៅលេខ 911 វិញទេ ពីព្រោះយើងបានសុំឱ្យទីក្រុងធ្វើការមួយកាលពីពីរសប្តាហ៍មុន ហើយប្រសិនបើមិនមាន ខ្ញុំដឹងថាពួកគេនឹងដាក់វានៅលើប្រតិទិនរបស់ទីក្រុង ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំបានសួរពួកគេទេ?
 ការហៅត្រឡប់មកវិញគឺគ្រាន់តែដើម្បីទទួលបានសារឆ្លងកាត់ អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាអ្នកដឹងថាអ្នកស្គាល់នរណា។ មានវិធីផ្សេងទៀត ខ្ញុំបានបង្ហោះវានៅលើប្រព័ន្ធផ្សព្វផ្សាយសង្គម ហើយទីក្រុងដាក់វានៅលើប្រតិទិន ប៉ុន្តែបាទ យើងដឹងថាមិនមែនគ្រប់គ្នានៅលើ Facebook ទេ មិនមែនគ្រប់គ្នាសុទ្ធតែនៅលើបណ្តាញសង្គមនោះទេ ដូច្នេះអ្នកដឹងទេ យើងចង់ធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថាយើងមានមនុស្សដូចអ្នក ចន អ្នកដឹងទេ មនុស្សដែលស្តាប់សារដែលពួកគេចូលចិត្ត និងមនុស្សទាំងអស់ដែលបានឆ្លើយតប។</p>

 ប៉ុន្តែតើមានបញ្ហាអ្វី? ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ខ្ញុំបានរៀបចំសន្និសីទមួយ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3836.496s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: ដូច្នេះ ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំអាចនិយាយខ្លីបាន ប្រសិនបើអ្នកបានចុះឈ្មោះសម្រាប់ការដាស់តឿនទីក្រុង ហើយអ្នកមិនទាន់បាន ហើយអ្នកនៅក្នុងតំបន់នោះ ហើយអ្នកមិនបានទទួលសារទេ អាស័យដ្ឋានរបស់អ្នកប្រហែលជាមិននៅក្នុងប្រព័ន្ធទេ។
 នេះជាអ្វីដែលយើងគិតថាជាបញ្ហា។
 ដើម្បីធ្វើដូចនេះអ្នកអាចចូលទៅកាន់ការព្រមាននៅលើគេហទំព័ររបស់ទីក្រុង។

 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​ឲ្យ​មនុស្ស​ដឹង​អំពី​រឿង​នោះ។</p>

 ជាក់ស្តែងក្នុងនាមជាអ្នកដើរកាត់ញូវតុន ខ្ញុំពិតជានឹកវាណាស់។

 ដូច្នេះហើយ អ្វី​ដែល​សំខាន់​បំផុត​នោះ​គឺ​ជា​យោបល់​របស់​អ្នក​ជុំវិញ​ខ្លួន​ទាំង​ផ្ទាល់ និង​អ្នក​ធ្វើ​ដំណើរ​ជុំវិញ​អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ន័យ​ថា ប្រសិន​បើ​មាន​សួន​ច្បារ​ជ័យ​ជម្នះ ហើយ​សួន​ច្បារ​ជ័យ​ជម្នះ​គឺ​មិន​អាច​ទៅ​រួច​ទេ។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ ពីព្រោះយើងមានការសន្ទនាផ្ទៃក្នុង ដោយសារយើងមានបញ្ហាសត្វកណ្តុរពាសពេញផ្ទៃ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីៗគឺល្អ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ដូច​គ្នា ប៉ុន្តែ​អ្នក​ដឹង​ទេ វាល​ស្រែ​ពិបាក​កាត់​ណាស់ ប្រហែល​ជា​ពីរ​ដង​ក្នុង​មួយ​ឆ្នាំ។
 សូម្បីតែពីអ្នកក៏ដោយ ក៏នៅតែមានគ្រួសជាច្រើនដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះថ្ងៃមួយ ខ្ញុំបានដកគល់កោណចេញពីសួនច្បារ ហើយដាក់វានៅសងខាងផ្លូវ សង្ឃឹមថានឹងមានអ្នកមកពីទីក្រុងមករកវានៅទីបំផុត។
 ព្រោះ​វា​នៅ​ទីនោះ​តាំង​ពី​ជញ្ជាំង​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​សាងសង់។
 មែនហើយ ខ្ញុំឃើញមានពេលមួយក្នុងដំណោះស្រាយមួយ ចុចលើ C ហើយមាននរណាម្នាក់ត្អូញត្អែរអំពីមនុស្សចោលសំរាមនៅទីនោះ។
 ទោះ​ជា​យ៉ាង​ណា ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា វា​បាន​ក្លាយ​ជា​ការ​ប្រកែក​ជាមួយ​អ្នក​ណា​ដែល​មក​ជួប​គាត់
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនធ្វើទេ ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចាប់ផ្តើមគម្រោង ហើយចាត់ទុកវាដូចជារឿងអាស្រូវ មនុស្សនឹងងាកមកគិត អូ វានៅតែឆ្កួត។
 ខ្ញុំអាចធ្វើអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចង់បាន។
 ដូច្នេះ​ដំណាក់កាល​ដំបូង​នៃ​គម្រោង​នេះ​ហាក់​ដូច​ជា​ត្រូវ​បាន​ដាក់​ឱ្យ​ដំណើរការ ប៉ុន្តែ​មិន​ទាន់​បញ្ចប់​នៅឡើយ​ទេ ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេថា មានទង់ជាតិនៅជុំវិញឆ្មាំ ហើយវាគួរឱ្យខ្ពើមណាស់ដែលពួកគេបាននៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំធ្លាប់មានចិត្តសប្បុរសចំពោះអ្នក មុនពេលជញ្ជាំងចាប់ផ្តើមប្រាប់អ្នកពីការពិត។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាផែនការដែលអ្នកធ្វើនឹងក្លាយជាការពិត ហើយរលាយបាត់។
 ខ្ញុំសប្បាយចិត្តណាស់ អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាវានៅតែនៅលើផ្លូវដើរនៅលើស្ពានក្នុងសួនឧទ្យាន ព្រោះមនុស្សត្រូវដើរនៅលើកំពូលម្តងទៀត។
 កុមារត្រូវដើរចូល និងជុំវិញផ្លូវ Grove។
 ខ្ញុំ​កំពុង​ប្រាប់ Mike របង​រលំ​ហើយ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ កូនប្រុសរបស់ខ្ញុំដើរកាត់ផ្លូវដែក ព្រោះវាស្ទើរតែមានសុវត្ថិភាពជាងការឡើងលើជ្រុង Grove ទៅមជ្ឈមណ្ឌលកម្សាន្ត។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ទាំងនេះគឺជាកង្វល់របស់ខ្ញុំ។
 មានពួកគេជាច្រើន។
 ខ្ញុំគួរតែធ្វើបញ្ជីមួយ ប៉ុន្តែវាអាចចំណាយពេល 30 នាទី។
 ប៉ុន្តែ ប្រាកដណាស់ វានឹងមានការចូលរួមពីអ្នកស្រុកកាន់តែច្រើន អ្នកដឹងទេ ព្រោះប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនរស់នៅទីនេះ អ្នកនឹងមិនមកឧទ្យាននេះទេ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ នេះមិនមែនជាចំណតទេ។
 នេះមិនមែនជាអ្នកជិះសេះទេ។
 មិនមានរឿងបែបនេះទេ។

 ពួកគេមានកូន មានមនុស្សដើរលើចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ។
 ភាពឯកជនរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺនៅទីនោះ។
 ម៉េចមិនបិទជញ្ជាំង ហើយទុកចន្លោះកណ្តាលផ្លូវ?
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​យល់​ថា​ហេតុ​អ្វី​បាន​ជា​គេ​មិន​ធ្វើ​បែប​នោះ​ទេ។
 បិទជញ្ជាំងនោះនៅថ្ងៃស្អែក ហើយបើកវានៅផ្លូវ Grove។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4397.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: មុនពេលអ្នកគ្រប់គ្នាលោតចូល អនុញ្ញាតឱ្យខ្ញុំផ្តល់ការបំភ្លឺខ្លះៗ ដែលអាចមានប្រយោជន៍។
 ដូច្នេះ​មាន​រឿង​ខុស​គ្នា​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​កំពុង​កើត​ឡើង​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ពិភាក្សា​បញ្ចប់​នេះ។
 យើង​មិន​អាច​ដាក់​ផ្លូវ​ថ្មើរ​ជើង​នៅ​ទី​នោះ​ទេ ព្រោះ​មាន​ផ្លូវ​ថ្មើរ​ជើង​រួច​ហើយ។
 យើង​មិន​ចង់​ឲ្យ​អ្នក​ណា​ម្នាក់​ដើរ​តាម​ទ្វារ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែក្រៅពីនោះ
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបានលើកឡើងពីមុន យើងចង់ប្រមូលផ្តុំចរាចរណ៍នៅចំនុចប្រសព្វសំខាន់នៃផ្លូវ Jackson ដូច្នេះត្រូវការចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ។
 ជញ្ជាំងទាំងមូលមានប្រវែងប្រាំហ្វីត។
 តាមពិតមានកន្លែងច្រើនជាងនេះ ប៉ុន្តែវាមានត្រឹមតែប្រាំហ្វីតប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ ADA ត្រូវតែមានទំហំ 48 អ៊ីងពីជញ្ជាំងដល់ផ្លូវកោង ហើយមាន 36 អ៊ីងនៃការបោសសំអាត។
 យើងមាននោះ។
 ប៉ុន្មានថ្ងៃមុនពួកយើង

 បើ​និយាយ​ពី​ការ​ចំណាយ យើង​នឹង​ពិនិត្យ​មើល​តម្លៃ​នៃ​ការ​បើក​ជញ្ជាំង​ឡើង​វិញ ឬ​ពង្រីក​ចិញ្ចើម​ផ្លូវ។
 ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវនៅផ្លូវ Jackson គឺថោកជាងប្រហែល $10,000។
 វានឹងត្រូវចំណាយ
 $36,000 យកអ្នកម៉ៅការត្រឡប់មកវិញ រើផ្ទះ បើកជញ្ជាំង រុះរើផ្លូវដើរ ដកជញ្ជាំង និងបើកចំហ។

 ប៉ុន្តែ​ជា​ថ្មី​ម្តង​ទៀត នេះ​គឺ​ជា​ការ​ជជែក​ដេញ​ដោល។
 លោកម្ចាស់ នេះជាយោបល់។
 បន្ទាប់មក ចរាចរណ៍អាចនឹងនិយាយថា៖ ទេ កុំធ្វើបែបនោះ។
 ចូរយើងត្រលប់ទៅគំនិតនៃការសាងសង់ជញ្ជាំងចូរយើងធ្វើវា។

 ជាផ្នែកមួយនៃការងារបឋម យើងចង់និយាយថា ប្រសិនបើយើងបើក និងបិទច្រកចូល ពួកគេទាំងអស់នឹងអាចចូលបាន។

 ដូច្នេះស្វាមីខ្ញុំ និងខ្ញុំបានកត់សម្គាល់ក្នុងរយៈពេលបីឆ្នាំចុងក្រោយនេះ ដែលយើងរស់នៅទីនេះថា របាំងសំឡេងត្រូវបានវាយកម្ទេចចោលទាំងស្រុង ចាប់តាំងពីដំណាក់កាលដំបូងត្រូវបានបញ្ចប់។
 សំឡេងរថភ្លើងគឺ

 វាហាក់ដូចជារាល់ថ្ងៃមានការរញ្ជួយដីតូចៗជាច្រើនដែលបណ្តាលមកពីដើមឈើរលំញ័រកំឡុងផ្នែកដំបូងនៃការជួសជុលជញ្ជាំង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមានការព្រួយបារម្ភយ៉ាងខ្លាំងចំពោះដើមឈើផ្សេងទៀតដែលនឹងត្រូវកាប់នៅពេលក្រោយក្នុងគម្រោង ព្រោះទោះបីជាដើមឈើថ្មីខ្លះនឹងត្រូវដាំក៏ដោយ យើងសង្ឃឹមថាពេលវេលានឹងមិនស្របគ្នានោះទេ ព្រោះវានឹងត្រូវការពេលវេលាដើម្បីឱ្យដើមឈើទាំងនេះឈានដល់ការពេញវ័យ។
 ដើម​ឈើ​ដែល​គេ​កាប់​នោះ​មាន​អាយុ​២០​ទៅ​៣០​ឆ្នាំ​ហើយ។
 ដូច្នេះ វា​នឹង​ត្រូវ​ចំណាយ​ពេល​មួយ​រយៈ​មុន​ពេល​ពួកគេ​ក្លាយ​ជា​របាំង​សំឡេង​ដ៏​មាន​ប្រសិទ្ធភាព។
 ក្នុងពេលជាមួយគ្នានោះ សំឡេងរបស់រថភ្លើងគឺគួរឱ្យអស់សំណើចណាស់។
 រំញ័រ​គួរ​ឱ្យ​ភ័យខ្លាច​បាន​បំបែក​របាំង​សំឡេង។

 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាវិធានការផ្សេងទៀតគឺចាំបាច់។
 វិធានការនានាត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើងដើម្បីកាត់បន្ថយផលប៉ះពាល់នៃរបាំងសំឡេងដោយកាប់ដើមឈើផ្សេងទៀត ហើយដើមឈើណាដែលដាំត្រូវលូតលាស់យ៉ាងឆាប់រហ័សដើម្បីជំនួសរបាំងសំឡេង។
 កាន់តែឆាប់កាន់តែល្អ។
 សំណួរទីពីររបស់ខ្ញុំទាក់ទងនឹងការថែទាំរុក្ខជាតិទាំងនេះ។
 ជាពិសេស តើអ្នកណានឹងគ្រប់គ្រងគម្រោងទាំងនេះ?
 តើនោះជាសេវាកម្មព្រៃឈើ Medford មែនទេ?
 តើគាត់នឹងក្លាយជា arborist ផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនទេ?
 តើ​ពួក​គេ​ចំណាយ​ប្រាក់​ដើម្បី​ស្រោច​ទឹក​រុក្ខជាតិ​ថ្មី​ទាំង​នេះ​ហើយ​ធានា​ថា​វា​នៅ​រស់​ឬ?
 ដោយសារដើមឈើត្រូវបានដាំនៅ Medford ដំបូងបង្អស់ដើមឈើថ្មីចំណាយពេលយូរដើម្បីដាំដោយហេតុផលថាយើងមិនចូលថ្ងៃនេះហើយដើមឈើក៏មិនត្រូវបានគេយកចិត្តទុកដាក់ផងដែរព្រោះគ្មាននរណាម្នាក់ស្រោចទឹកពួកគេដោយសារតែខ្វះលុយ។
 ដូច្នេះ ដើមឈើដែលទើបនឹងដាំថ្មីត្រូវការការថែទាំជាប្រចាំយ៉ាងតិចបីឆ្នាំ ដើម្បីធានាបាននូវការរស់រានមានជីវិតរបស់វា។</p>

 ដូច្នេះ នេះ​ជា​អ្វី​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​អាច​ពិភាក្សា​ជាមួយ​នឹង​លោក Peter ដែល​ជា​ស្ថាបត្យករ​ទេសភាព ដែល​ពិតជា​អាច​ជួយ និង​ពិនិត្យ​មើល​រឿង​នោះ។
 យើងអាចដោះស្រាយបញ្ហានេះបាន។
 យើងអាចសាកល្បងវាបាន។
 ដូចដែលនរណាម្នាក់បានលើកឡើង របង MBTA ត្រូវបានរុះរើ។
 យើង​ចង់​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​ប្រាកដ​ថា​នៅ​ពេល​ដែល​ការងារ​ត្រូវ​បាន​ធ្វើ​នៅ​លើ​ដើម​ឈើ វា​នឹង​មាន​មុខងារ​ម្ដង​ទៀត។
 វិធីនេះ នឹងលែងមានផ្លូវឆ្លងកាត់ដែលមិនមានសុវត្ថិភាពទៀតហើយ ព្រោះរថភ្លើងនឹងចាកចេញនៅពេលដែលការសាងសង់រួចរាល់។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ មនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នាកំពុងឆ្ពោះទៅមុខ មិនមែនគ្រប់គ្នាឈប់នៅទីនោះទេ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4806.644s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចង់​និយាយ​អ្វី​ច្រើន​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​កូន​ខ្ញុំ​និង​ខ្ញុំ​អាច​បញ្ជាក់​ពី​រឿង​នេះ​បាន ព្រោះ​កន្លង​មក​គាត់​ធ្លាប់​និយាយ​លេង​សើច​តែ​ម្ដង។
 យើងពិតជាបានព្យាយាមសម្អាត Walter Ravine Poms នៅសងខាងផ្លូវ ហើយពីខាងក្រោយ យើងពិតជាបានទាញស្មៅ ហើយចូលទៅដាំផ្កាដើម ដូចជាសួនលំអងផ្កាពិតប្រាកដ។
 មាន​ដី​នៅ​ខាង​មុខ​និង​ខាង​ក្រោយ​ជញ្ជាំង គ្មាន​ភាព​កខ្វក់​អ្វី​នៅ​ពី​ក្រោម​ឡើយ គ្រាន់​តែ​ថ្ម។
 ឆ្នាំនេះយើងពិតជាត្រូវបានមិត្តភក្តិរបស់យើងផ្តល់ផ្កាលីលី និងអំពូលផ្សេងៗគ្នា ហើយយើងកំពុងព្យាយាមដាំវានៅមូលដ្ឋានជញ្ជាំង អ្នកដឹងទេ នៅចំហៀង ប្រសិនបើអ្នកស្គាល់តំបន់នោះ មានដើមឈើមួយដូចបាល់តូចមួយនៅពីក្រោយជញ្ជាំងខាងឆ្វេង។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​រឿង​មួយ​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ចងចាំ​គឺ​ត្រូវ​ស្រោច​ទឹក​ឱ្យ​បាន​ច្រើន ព្រោះ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ប្រាកដ​ថា​តើ​មួយ​ណា​នឹង​រក្សា​ទុក។
 គ្រាប់ពូជរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំបានដាំគ្រាប់ពូជមានតម្លៃ 60 ដុល្លារក្នុងឆ្នាំនេះ និងគ្រាប់ពូជមានតម្លៃ 80 ដុល្លារកាលពីឆ្នាំមុន។
 ពួកយើងមានរឿងខ្លះដែលចំណាយពេលយូរ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំស្អប់ពាក្យនេះ ព្រោះមានមនុស្សមិនចូលចិត្ត ខ្ញុំមិនស្គាល់នរណាម្នាក់នៅទីនោះ ប៉ុន្តែជាមួយនឹងការប្រែប្រួលអាកាសធាតុ វាជារដូវរងាក្តៅ និងស្ងួតខ្លាំង។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នករស់នៅទីនេះ អ្នកដឹងថាព្រះអាទិត្យមកពីណា។
 ពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យមិនត្រូវចាំងដោយផ្ទាល់ទៅលើតំបន់នោះទេ។
 បន្ទាប់មកស្ងួតខ្លាំង គ្មានជាតិកខ្វក់។
 មិនមានជាន់។
 ដោយផ្ទាល់នៅលើផ្នែកណាមួយនៃជញ្ជាំងនេះ។
 នៅពេលដែលអ្នកចូល ឬឆ្លងកាត់វា អ្នកនឹងឃើញដី និងស្មៅជាច្រើន។
 ប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់ធ្វើវត្ថុតុបតែងដូចជាផ្កាលីលី ឬរុក្ខជាតិផ្សេងទៀត នរណាម្នាក់ត្រូវតែថែរក្សាវា ជាពិសេសដាំវា។
 ដូច្នេះមិនមានទឹកដោយផ្ទាល់នៅទីនោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាគិតអំពីការសួរអ្នកជិតខាងរបស់ខ្ញុំថាតើខ្ញុំអាចប្រើប្រាស់ផ្ទះជ្រុងរបស់ពួកគេ និងស្រោចទឹកផ្ទះរបស់ពួកគេនៅតាមផ្លូវបានដែរឬទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មិន​សម​ហេតុផល​ទេ​នៅ​ចំណុច​នេះ។
 ហើយស្មៅដុះនៅគ្រប់ទីកន្លែង។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ការធ្លាក់មកម្តងក្នុងមួយឆ្នាំនៅក្នុងទីក្រុងនេះ ហើយស្មៅបំផ្លាញអ្វីៗទាំងអស់។

 ដូច្នេះបាទ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនោះហើយជាវា។
 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បញ្ជាក់រឿងនេះ។
 បើ​អ្នក​ចង់​ធ្វើ​បែប​នេះ អ្នក​មាន​ថវិកា​សម្រាប់​អ្វី​ផ្សេង​ទៀត។</p>

 មិនអីទេ
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​នេះ​ជា​ការ​ខកចិត្ត​មួយ​ដែល​យើង​ជា​ច្រើន​ជួប​ប្រទះ។

 ពួកយើងជាច្រើនខ្លាចការផ្លាស់ប្តូរ មែនទេ?
 នៅពេលយើងកាន់តែចាស់ យើងឈានទៅដល់ដំណាក់កាលមួយក្នុងជីវិតរបស់យើង ដែលយើងមិនចង់ឃើញការផ្លាស់ប្តូរខ្លាំងពេក។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​សម្រាប់​ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំ​ឃើញ​យើង​អង្គុយ​ក្នុង​សហគមន៍​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​អាច​ចូល​រួម​ក្នុង​រឿង​ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​មិន​ចង់​ជន់​លិច​សង្កាត់​របស់​យើង​ដោយ​មាន​ឡាន​សាលា និង​ហ្វូង​មនុស្ស ឬ​ជន់​លិច​ទីធ្លា​សាធារណៈ​ជា​ច្រើន​ដែរ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលជាមួយគ្នានេះដែរ មានរឿងមួយនៅទីនេះ ដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងគួរដឹងគុណ។
 ដូច្នេះការគិតរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺអ្នកដឹងទេ ចូរយើងធ្វើវាដោយគិតគូរ គិតគូរពីសហគមន៍ ដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកគ្រប់គ្នាកំពុងធ្វើ ជាជាងការព្យាយាមនាំមកនូវចរាចរណ៍ដែលមិនចាំបាច់ច្រើន។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលជាមួយគ្នានេះគឺជាតំបន់ដែលអាចមានប្រយោជន៍សម្រាប់:
 អ្នកដឹងទេថា ក្មេងៗនៅសាលា Brooks ចូលចិត្តដើរតាមផ្លូវនៅថ្ងៃនិទាឃរដូវ ហើយទៅដើរលេងដើម្បីស្វែងយល់បន្ថែមបន្តិចអំពីប្រវត្តិសាស្រ្តនៃតំបន់នោះ ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាវាមានសារៈសំខាន់ខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ពួកគេ។

 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថារឿងនេះត្រូវបានកោតសរសើរ ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាមានអ្វីគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ខ្លាំងណាស់អំពីការសាងសង់ និងការប្រើប្រាស់កប៉ាល់នេះ។
 ប៉ុស្តិ៍ និង​ការ​ចូលចិត្ត​អាច​មាន​តម្លៃ​ពិត។

 ដូច​អ្នក​ដទៃ​ដែរ ខ្ញុំ​បាន​រស់​នៅ​ទី​នេះ​ប្រហែល ៣០ ឆ្នាំ​ហើយ។
 ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ការ​ព្រួយ​បារម្ភ​បន្តិច​ព្រោះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​អ្នក​នឹង​ឈាន​ទៅ​មុខ​ជាមួយ​គម្រោង​ទាំង​មូល​នេះ​ដោយ​មិន​និយាយ​ជាមួយ​អ្នក​ជិត​ខាង​ឬ​អ្នក​រស់​នៅ​ក្នុង​សហគមន៍​នេះ​ទេ។
 ខ្ញុំក៏ចូលចិត្តកន្លែងបៃតងដែរ។

 ខ្ញុំស្រលាញ់ឧទ្យានតូចដែលយើងមាននៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ចូល​ចិត្ត​ការ​ផ្លាស់​ប្តូរ​នេះ​ទេ ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​មើល​ឃើញ​ថា​ពួកគេ​កំពុង​ព្យាយាម​ធ្វើ​ឱ្យ​សួន​កម្សាន្ត​កាន់​តែ​ងាយ​ស្រួល​សម្រាប់​រទេះ​រុញ និង​ជន​ពិការ ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា

 ខ្ញុំបានមើលផែនការជាន់ ហើយរហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះ ខ្ញុំឃើញចំណតរថយន្តពីរនៅសងខាងផ្លូវ។
 តើមានអ្នកណាអាចពន្យល់ខ្ញុំពីរបៀបចតឡាន ADA នៅតាមផ្លូវ ហើយធ្វើអោយរទេះរុញអាចចូលបានបានទេ?

 ផ្លូវនេះគឺជាផ្លូវហាយវេ។
 អ្នកដាក់សញ្ញាទាំងនេះ បង្កើនល្បឿន គ្មានអ្វីគ្រប់គ្រងល្បឿនទេ។
 មែនហើយ តាមពិតគិតថាអ្នកអាចបន្ថយល្បឿនអ្នកប្រើប្រាស់រទេះរុញទៅទីនោះបាន
 នរណាម្នាក់នឹងស្លាប់។

 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាទីក្រុងកំពុងរងគ្រោះពីកម្មករថែទាំ។

 នៅក្បែរនោះ ដើមឈើនៅមុខផ្ទះនីមួយៗបានដួលរលំ។
 ផ្ទះនីមួយៗមានដើមឈើរលួយ។

 រឿងនេះគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ណាស់ ហើយយើងចូលចិត្តវាណាស់។
 ប៉ុន្តែមានភាពទាក់ទាញ និងស្រលាញ់ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រជុំវិញវា។
 មនុស្សឆ្លើយតបយ៉ាងល្អចំពោះអ្វីៗ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំត្រូវតែនិយាយថា ផ្លូវ Grove គឺដូចជា gauntlet ល្បឿន។

 ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំឆ្លងកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវនេះ ទល់មុខផ្ទះរបស់ខ្ញុំនៅ Grove នៅលើផ្លូវដីហុយនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាតាមបច្ចេកទេសវាអាចមើលទៅធំទូលាយ ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលដែលឡានឆ្លងកាត់អ្នក វាមិនធំទូលាយទេ។
 នេះពិតជាគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់។
 នេះជាកង្វល់ធំបំផុតរបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 វាជាផ្លូវដ៏មមាញឹក ផ្លូវញូតុន និងផ្លូវ Grove។
 នេះជាផ្លូវបំបែកដ៏មមាញឹក។
 ឬ​ឡាន​ថ្មី​ហើយ​ត្រៀម​ដឹក​ឥវ៉ាន់​ជុំវិញ។
 មនុស្សបើកនៅទីនោះគ្រប់ពេល ហើយអ្នកបើកបរ Uber ក៏បត់ជ្រុងនោះផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របថានេះជាដំណើរកំសាន្តក្នុងស្រុក។
 ខ្ញុំ​ពិត​ជា​គិត​ថា​ពួក​គេ​គួរ​តែ​ពិចារណា​ឡើង​វិញ​ផ្នែក​នេះ​យ៉ាង​ហ្មត់ចត់។
 ព្រោះ​បើ​គេ​គិត​ម្ដង​ទៀត ហើយ​រៀន​ថែម​ទៀត នោះ​ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ន័យ​ថា អ្នក​រាល់​គ្នា​នឹង​យល់​ច្រឡំ​នឹង​អត្ថបទ​នេះ​ដូច​ខ្ញុំ។
 នេះគួរតែត្រូវបានគិតដោយប្រុងប្រយ័ត្ន។
 ត្រូវការការរួមចំណែកបន្ថែមទៀត ពីព្រោះនេះជាកិច្ចការក្នុងស្រុក។
 ខ្ញុំនិយាយថាចំណាយលុយ។
 លុយ​ដែល​ចំណាយ​ពេល​នេះ​គឺ​គ្មាន​អ្វី​ប្រៀប​ធៀប​នឹង​អ្វី​ដែល​អាច​ចំណាយ​បាន​ទេ គ្រាន់​តែ​កាក់​ប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 បន្ទាប់មកពិតណាស់មានលុយ។
 ចំណាយលុយរបស់អ្នកដោយប្រាជ្ញា។
 លើកមុនខ្ញុំពិនិត្យវាមិនលឿនទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលអ្នកដំឡើងវា វានឹងដំណើរការជារៀងរហូត។
 នេះគឺជាប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលវាមានសារៈសំខាន់ក្នុងការធ្វើវាឱ្យត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​បាន​ប៉ះពាល់​ផ្ទាល់​ដូច​អ្នក​ដទៃ​ដែរ។
 យើងទាំងអស់គ្នាបាននៅជាមួយវាមួយរយៈ។
 យើងទាំងអស់គ្នាបានខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងយ៉ាងខ្លាំងនៅក្នុងផ្ទះរបស់យើងនៅទីនេះ ហើយយើងស្រឡាញ់វានៅទីនេះ។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលខ្ញុំណែនាំអ្នកឱ្យពិចារណាឡើងវិញអំពីការបើកការិយាល័យនៅជិតផ្ទះរបស់លោក John ។
 John ធ្វើ​ការ​ជា​ច្រើន​នៅ​ជុំវិញ​ផ្ទះ និង​មើល​ថែ​ទ្រព្យ​សម្បត្តិ​របស់​គាត់។
 ធ្វើអ្វីមួយអំពីសំលេងរំខាន។
 នៅពេលដែលអ្នកនៅក្នុងទីធ្លាខាងក្រោយរបស់អ្នក ជាទូទៅកាលពីប៉ុន្មានឆ្នាំមុន មុនពេលកូវីដ អ្វីដែលអ្នកបានឮគឺឡានក្រុង រថភ្លើង។
 មានយន្តហោះមួយនៅពេលអ្នកនៅក្នុងទីធ្លារបស់អ្នក។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីៗដែលប្រើដើមឈើ និងគុម្ពោតជារុក្ខជាតិគឺអស្ចារ្យណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា នោះជាមូលដ្ឋានវា ប៉ុន្តែល្បឿនដូចជាស្រោមដៃរបស់ Newton និង Grove គឺជាកត្តាសំខាន់បំផុតសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។</p>

 អរគុណច្រើន។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6009.428s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: បាទ Elyse Jennings ផ្លូវ 94 Grove នៅមុខជញ្ជាំងទាសករ។
 សូមអរគុណចំពោះការរៀបចំកិច្ចប្រជុំនេះ និងផ្តល់ព័ត៌មានទាំងអស់។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របនឹងរឿងនោះ។
 ជា​ច្រើន​យប់​បន្ទាប់​ពី​ការងារ​ត្រូវ​បាន​បញ្ចប់ ខ្ញុំ​ភ្ញាក់​ពី​ដំណេក​ដោយ​គិត​ថា​មាន​រញ្ជួយ​ដី។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​លើក​ឡើង​នូវ​ចំណុច​មួយ​ដែល​មិន​ទាន់​បាន​ធ្វើ​ឡើង។
 អូ ខ្ញុំ​ជា​ម្ចាស់​ឆ្កែ ហើយ​មាន​កូន​ប្រុស​ម្នាក់​នៅ​ផ្លូវ Grove។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​ចង់​លើក​ពី​បញ្ហា​ផ្លូវ​ថ្មើរជើង។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់, ខ្ញុំយល់ពីតម្រូវការសម្រាប់ការចូលដំណើរការហើយវាអាចជួយបន្ថយចរាចរណ៍។
 ខ្ញុំ​បារម្ភ​តែ​អំពី​សត្វ​ចម្លែក​ដែល​មាន​ឡូហ្គោ​ច្រើន​ពេក ឬ​មាន​ភ្លើង​ចាំង។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាវគ្គទាំងនេះនឹងទៅជាយ៉ាងណានោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ដឹង​ថា​យើង​ពិត​ជា​ត្រូវ​ការ​ប៉ុន្មាន​ទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គ្រាន់​តែ​ចង់​លើក​ឡើង​ពី​នេះ​ព្រោះ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ដែល​បាន​ឮ​វា​ពី​មុន​មក​។
 ខ្ញុំក៏ចង់បន្ទរសារនៃការផ្សព្វផ្សាយ។
 ខ្ញុំបានលឺអ្នកជិតខាងដឹងថាខ្ញុំរស់នៅទីនេះ ហើយប្រាប់ខ្ញុំអំពីវា ខ្ញុំសំណាងណាស់ដែលបានស្គាល់អ្នកជិតខាងខ្លះ ព្រោះខ្ញុំនៅទីនេះ ៨ ឆ្នាំហើយ ប៉ុន្តែយើងមានអ្នកជិតខាងថ្មីខ្លះដែលមិនទាន់បានភ្ជាប់ទំនាក់ទំនង។
 ដូច្នេះ វាជាការប្រសើរជាង ប្រសិនបើអ្នកអាចស្វែងរកព័ត៌មានបានយ៉ាងងាយស្រួលអំពីកិច្ចប្រជុំទាំងនេះ និងផែនការទាំងនេះកំពុងត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើង។
 ហើយ​សូម​អធិប្បាយ​បន្តិច​ទៅ​លើ​ពេល​ដែល​ជញ្ជាំង​ទាសករ​និង​ជញ្ជាំង​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​ត្រូវ​បាន​សាងសង់។
 ជា​ថ្មី​ម្តង​ទៀត ការ​និយាយ​ពី​រឿង​មិន​សប្បាយ​ចិត្ត យើង​មាន​ធុង​នៅ​ពី​មុខ​យើង។
 រថយន្តនឹងឈប់ ហើយមនុស្សនឹងប្រើផតធីផតធី។
 បន្ទាប់ពីការងារនេះត្រូវបានបញ្ចប់ គាត់ស្នាក់នៅទីនោះជាច្រើនខែ ឬយ៉ាងហោចណាស់ពីរបីសប្តាហ៍ក្រោយមក។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាតើការងារបន្ទាប់របស់ខ្ញុំនឹងរួមបញ្ចូលឆ្នាំងបាយទេ ប៉ុន្តែគ្រាន់តែក្នុងករណី
 ដោតវាចូល ហើយត្រូវប្រាកដថាវាគ្រប់គ្រងបានល្អ ដូច្នេះយើងមិនចាំបាច់ស្នាក់នៅទីនោះយូរជាងម៉ោងធ្វើការទេ។
 មែនហើយ ទាំងនេះគ្រាន់តែជាមតិដែលខ្ញុំចង់ធ្វើ។
 សូមអរគុណ
