    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=0.531s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muito rapidamente, recapitularemos o plano diretor geral do parque que foi desenvolvido em 2020.
 Resumiremos o trabalho da primeira fase que já foi concluído até o momento.
 Isso inclui a restauração do Muro Pomp, a restauração do Muro Fieldstone e a escavação arqueológica, que sei que alguns de vocês vieram ver e participar, então obrigado por isso.
 Temos o que chamamos de uma nova atualização do plano diretor.
 Assim, a partir da nossa escavação arqueológica, recebemos algumas recomendações para implementar.
 E esse é realmente o ponto crucial da apresentação desta noite que queríamos compartilhar com a comunidade.
 E isso realmente ajudará a construir nosso pipeline para o que chamamos de fase três do trabalho no parque.
 Então, concluímos a fase um, nos próximos meses iniciaremos a fase dois, e agora estamos construindo o pipeline para a fase três, que é o que chamamos de caminhada histórica, alguns sinais, alguns marcos históricos.
 E repito, estes são apenas conceitos que vamos compartilhar com vocês esta noite.
 Ainda não temos financiamento para esta fase e ainda estamos buscando feedback da comunidade.
 Mas de certa forma, você sabe, estamos iniciando a fase dois e temos que olhar para a fase três. Queríamos apenas manter a bola rolando aqui em algumas das coisas do plano diretor.
 E depois voltaremos no final para falar sobre a segunda fase e o trabalho que temos pela frente, que sei que muitos de vocês provavelmente ficarão entusiasmados e para o qual garantimos financiamento.
 Estamos prestes a começar a enviar algumas RFPs para fornecedores seguros e esse trabalho está programado para ser concluído.
 a primeira parte do próximo ano.
 E então no final teremos comentários, perguntas e comentários.
 Pedimos gentilmente que finalizemos a apresentação antes de responder perguntas ou comentários, e assim todos terão a oportunidade de falar ao final sobre o que quiserem naquele momento.
 Portanto, a partir deste ponto, passarei a palavra a Ryan Hayward e Peter Hedlund, que abordarão o cerne da apresentação.
 E pessoal, peguem.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=149.076s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you, Jen, for that introduction, and I think Ryan's going to get the.
 Presentation up on the screen.
 Great.
 Thanks, Ryan.
 So everybody should be looking at just the title slide here.
 My name is Peter Headland, a landscape architect and a planner based in Arlington right next door.
 I was fortunate enough to work on the master plan project and have now been doing a little study on this concept design.
 And we'll talk about that shortly here.
 Okay, next slide.
 Great.
 The 2020 master plan, we started in 2019.
 It was almost a year process.
 It went through 2020.
 And that's all on the historical commission website.
 And at the end of that, we came up with a series of phased implementation projects that could happen over a period of
 20 years, and we'll talk about the first phase of that with the next slide.
 So this shows the first, say, seven of these implementation ideas that came out of the master plan, restoring the wall, the historic wall right on the edge of Grove Street.
 an archaeological dig at the estate, which has also taken place.
 We'll talk about that a little bit.
 Making improvements to the Grove Street edge, the fieldstone wall there.
 Those were in phase one and we'll go over those in a little bit.
 Other projects
 from the master planning include new crosswalks, improvements to the trails, some type of signage to identify the park, and some planting in this central planted LA.
 Okay, on the next slide, we'll talk about that.
 The first step and really the reason for this whole park is what's now known as Pomp's Wall.
 In 2019, the image on the upper left, that was the condition when we began the master plan and we had a historic masonry consultant, Richard Irons, come and maybe some of you heard him talk.
 He gave a presentation a number of years ago.
 He evaluated the wall.
 I wrote up a pretty detailed technical memo about the wall and went over some options to restore the wall.
 Some of you might know that a wall that part of the, in the deed when this part was given to the city of Medford, it stipulated that this wall, they were so proud of this wall, that this wall needed to be forever maintained.
 The preservation and restoration of this wall is really important or else technically, the old estate could take this part back over, but luckily, that's not going to happen.
 The middle slide there shows the previous joint conditions, pretty deteriorated and the capstone needed some significant repair.
 So, in the next slide, we show the process in 2023.
 Mason was hired to do that work.
 This is that restoration.
 A lot of the wall really had to be taken apart and put back together.
 And maybe some of you.
 were there or witnessed some of that progress.
 And the brick on the right side is pretty interesting.
 The contractor pulled that out and you can see a fingerprints on the top of that brick.
 So that's
 Pretty interesting, the wall was said to have been built in 1760, and so those are over 250 years old.
 Were they from Pompeii, the former enslaved person who built the wall?
 Perhaps Medford was known for local brick making and these bricks were sourced locally, but that's really sort of a neat glimpse of history and all those bricks went back into that wall.
 On the next slide, you can see the final result from last year of the newly restored wall with newly pointed bricks.
 They ended up putting a new cap on top of it to really seal that with flashing.
 Hopefully, this will last for the next few generations.
 Okay, so the next project that came out of the master plan in phase 1 was improving the Grove Street edge, the old field stone wall.
 It's an interesting historic image on the right hand side of the screen here, which shows it's looking up Grove Street.
 That is the
 historic wall, formerly known as the slave wall, now known as Pompe's wall.
 And you can see the wall as it was historically, but over time, it had sort of fallen apart in some areas more than others.
 The image on the left here is showing prior to the master plan, you know, the
 wall in this area was pretty gone, and so the thought there was to improve this fieldstone wall.
 And so the next slide shows the results of that.
 With the wall repaired, it really helps to define the edge of the park.
 Also, cutouts were left at intersections for crosswalks to access the park.
 And...
 Another part of that project was for five feet behind that wall, clearing out the understory, a lot of invasive plants have popped up in there.
 Clearing that out a little bit, let these big trees, you can see this one over on the right side, give them a little bit more room to grow.
 Ryan, at the end, we'll talk a little bit about some upcoming planting maintenance improvements.
 Okay, on the next slide, we talk about the third part of this first phase of projects coming out of the master plan, the archaeological dig at the estate.
 Here we see illustration of the Thomas Brooks house that was right behind that wall.
 This later colored here, that's that wall, that's Pomp's Wall.
 You can see the drive right behind it and what this house looked like.
 It was built in 1727.
 The house was demolished in 1860.
 Then it just really sat there because it was never redeveloped and became a park.
 The archaeologists we brought on for the master plan were determined, and they were correct, that this is a highly sensitive area for archaeological findings.
 And the master plan proposed an archaeological dig
 with a professional and to work collaboratively with community volunteers, and that happened.
 And they thought that there was the possibility to find, very good possibility to find both pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.
 And on the next slide, we see that dig, which happened in 2022 and 23.
 Maybe some people on this call, this Zoom meeting were part of that.
 You can see some of the people from the community along with the professionals working on that dig.
 There were 23 test pits and over 1,600 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 And post-contact and pre-contact mean either pre-contact is pre-colonial settlement and post-contact is after settlers arrived.
 So there was both interesting findings from both of those areas, which is pretty neat.
 And here's some of the things that were found.
 That piece of pottery was on that site.
 Okay, next slide please Ryan.
 So there is a pretty detailed survey report from the master plan that made some recommendations.
 They recommended to protect and preserve this site, specifically this estate site area.
 They thought it was a highly sensitive area in and around the house site, and that in this area, that any below ground disturbance should be avoided or ideally kept at a real minimum.
 And that will come into play when we talk about the concept for this area.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan.
 We see where that area is.
 This is the approximate house location.
 We're looking south on the dirt path.
 You can kind of see the back of Pomp's wall there.
 So that's generally where that house was.
 On the next slide, we have a couple images looking both south on that site.
 Some low vinca has grown up there.
 Maybe,
 A remnant from ground cover that was planted originally that could be possible.
 And then this is looking north.
 It was a pretty open site originally around that estate, but trees have have grown in over time.
 Okay, and the next slide.
 We see a couple other just context views of the north entrance.
 This is the newly reconstructed wall and the break in the wall at the roadway opposite.
 This is looking south on the south approach and you can see the open lawn there.
 These are the two ways that visitors would get to this area.
 Next slide.
 Okay, so we've been working for the last number of months and through a couple meetings on a design concept for this central area for this historically sensitive area, and I'll walk you through the main.
 Concepts here, and with the 3 big ideas for the design concept to improve accessibility to the park.
 And help identify the park as such as as a park and to make some of this really interesting history visible.
 I remember when I first started working on the master plan, and I.
 was out exploring the park, it's definitely not evident that it is or was a town-owned property.
 And so the improvements to the walls certainly help.
 And some simple signage will help to identify it as an important historical park for the town of Medford.
 So the first concept is a history wall.
 which is a, these paths really sort of already exist, they're dirt pathways, mostly, and creating a loop here in this thicker orange line that would help to connect
 a number of these historically sensitive areas and use historic markers to interpret the history a little bit.
 And we'll go through each of those.
 But these blue circles are those 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 markers there.
 Also, two potential areas for welcome signs to the park.
 We'll talk about the
 interpretation and stabilization measures around the former estate site.
 And you have to be able to get to the park, so new crosswalks and accessible parking.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan, we'll kind of walk through each of these.
 First is the history walk.
 The walk, again, in this thicker orange here, it would be an accessible path in terms of slope and surfacing.
 We haven't done a detailed, there hasn't been a detailed field survey done of this area of the park, but we think that it can be an accessible path below 5% slope.
 And we'd like to connect that to new crosswalks so people from this community, or maybe who are parking there could get into this park.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 There are 2 potential areas for welcome signs, and Ryan will talk a little bit more about this at the end.
 It would be great to identify the park, to name it, and to welcome visitors, to make them feel welcome.
 So here, opposite Jackson Road or potentially Ravine Road to the north are 2 potential areas for welcome signs.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 just a little bit history about Thomas Brooks Park.
 This is 1860 Brooks estate plan, which was pretty big.
 A lot of this land has since been given to the city of Medford.
 Our little sliver right there is Thomas Brooks Park.
 You can tell it's this almost like sharp triangle.
 Up on the upper right is
 at H.F.
 Walling Plan from 1855.
 And here we see our park there.
 It's easy to identify the railroad, which is this diagonal line, and then Grove Street.
 And so that sliver right there is what the future park looked like in 1855.
 It is adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.
 And then the six-acre park was conveyed to the city in 1924, again, with the stipulation that the
 brick wall, now known as Pomp's Wall, be forever maintained.
 On the next slide, we talk about these historic markers.
 Originally, in earlier iteration, this walk was just a linear path from here to here.
 But then as we took some feedback and evolved it a little bit, it's become more of a loop.
 Pomp's wall is right here just to orient everyone.
 It's great.
 And Grove Street is right here.
 So the proposal is to have a series of five simple historic markers so that visitors to the site would help to understand the rich history here a little bit better.
 Both the Native American history,
 which marker could be there, the African American history with this pretty remarkable wall, Pomp's Wall, that's just been restored.
 There's a pretty fascinating history of water systems and the Middlesex Canal here, and
 This is an appropriate place for that historic marker because it looks out over this lawn.
 We'll talk about that in a little bit.
 And then on the back of the park here, you're right next to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, now known as the MBTA Lowell Branch Railroad.
 which also has a rich history, and then coming around to the colonial American history of the site and the sort of remains of the Thomas Brooke estate and thinking about how to interpret and mark that.
 Okay, so over the next handful of slides, we move to the next one, we'll talk about how to do that and why that's important.
 So the Native American historic marker, again, with the archaic,
 I have a hard time saying that word today.
 With the dig that was just done, there were 64 pre-contact artifacts found collected during the 22-23 dig, which is pretty neat.
 Maybe some community members on this call or in this picture, I don't know.
 Largely, the items that were found were chipping debris and pottery shards.
 presumably from the middle to late Woodlands period, 2000 to 450 years ago.
 So pretty significant historical resource.
 And this has a potential for rich Native American history, given the proximity of water resources and the
 topography.
 So that's pretty invisible now, but it'd be great to make that history a little bit more visible, just with a simple interpretive marker.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we talk about Pomp's Wall.
 Okay, the existing marker, which is there, if you want to
 Sneak on the edge of the roadway and or peek at it from your car is shown on the upper right there.
 This upper left is a historic photo, which the date is unknown of, and the photo in the middle is from 1899.
 So you can look up Grove Street.
 You can see the wall, it's beginning to get overgrown there, but pretty open behind it, some of the big trees there.
 We know the wall was constructed around 1760, that the city is required to preserve and forever maintain it in that deed.
 to the city, it stipulates that.
 And then there was this recent, very important restoration and renaming of the wall.
 So that's an important history to help make visible.
 Okay, if we go to the next slide, we can help to mark in a way the importance of the Medford water systems.
 This picture on the left is a little hard to see.
 All these slides will be posted on the
 Historical Commission website.
 And if you look on there, there's a lot of information from the past number of years from all the studies and meetings that were done.
 This is a plaque elsewhere in Medford that shows the Middlesex Canal and the route.
 Our little park
 is right here.
 You can see the railroad and Grove Street.
 And so this Middlesex Canal was right to the south of this area.
 The Middlesex Canal was around from 1793 to 1853, ran from Charlestown to Lowell.
 It was partly financed by the Brooks family, which has such a prominent role.
 in the city of Medford.
 It supplied much of the lumber for shipbuilding in Medford.
 That was such a big industry in the city.
 On the lower right is an image of one of the bridges.
 There were a number of
 bridges, 50 bridges, all along the canal.
 And this was one in Medford that was taken down.
 But we think that some of these blocks were used in this Grove Street field stone wall, especially south of Pomp's Wall.
 You can go look and the stones there are more cut in.
 rectilinear blocks.
 I can't get into a lot of it here, but there's really a fascinating study that the head of the MWRA did on the role of Medford in the whole water and sewer development for the city of Boston in the nearby area.
 It's pretty fascinating.
 area where we're proposing this historic marker looking out on that field, well part of the reason the field is there and it's not overgrown is because there's a sewer easement that actually runs through there.
 And so there's a lot of interesting things to talk about for a potential historic marker talking about these water systems and the task will be how to distill this information in a concise way.
 Okay.
 If we go to the next slide, I talked a little bit about the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the proposals for historic marker on the backside of Thomas Brooks Park, talking about this, that this railroad was constructed in 1835.
 Also,
 partly financed by the Brooks family, the people didn't really want the railroad to happen, especially the people who were invested in the canal because the railroad made the canal not as necessary.
 And it essentially replaced the canal in order to speed up.
 Transportation provide year-round freight transportation because the canal would freeze in the winter.
 This railroad, it was the first major railroad in the state, one of the first in the whole Northeast, and it's still used today.
 It's an active rail line as the MBTA Lowell line.
 That's an image on the bottom right.
 You can see Boston and Lowell there.
 Okay, and Ryan, if you go to the next slide, the last historic marker kind of gets back to what we started with, with the dig on the site.
 Now, this is an image of the Brooks Estate House, and the historic marker would help to reinterpret that or interpret that history.
 that this house was built in 1727, you can see here there was a little curved driveway behind that brick wall.
 And that's essentially where, if you walk out there, where that dirt footpath is and where that history walk would be.
 Then you can see the brick wall between the street and the driveway, that's the palms wall.
 We know historically it was noted that there were three black walnut trees in front of the house.
 You can see them in this illustration and also those original trees aren't there.
 But if you're out there in that park, there are black walnut trees that are descendants, I think, of these original trees.
 Then as we know, there are a lot of artifacts recovered.
 from the dig over 1600 from the post-contact or colonial era.
 Okay, on the next slide, we looked at this site.
 This is the general area of that estate house, and the proposal is to both protect and preserve and interpret this site a little bit by marking the
 Corners of where the house was with simple stone blocks and stabilizing the surface with low plantings.
 And then this would be the blue circle that historic marker, which would be able to interpret it.
 So, if you go to the next slide.
 This was one of the site precedents that we looked at, Robbins Farm Park.
 It's a neat park right next door to Medford, up on the top of the hill.
 There's an old farm there.
 It was given to the city, turned into a park, and maybe probably 10 years or so ago,
 Park and Recreation Commission wanted to sort of memorialize the house in the former farm there.
 And so they put, they marked the foundation here with these stone blocks.
 These are kind of similar to what we're thinking for Thomas Brooks Park.
 And they had a simple sign in their case, it was right on the block.
 In our case, maybe it would be a separate standing element as a way to
 Talk about the former farmhouse that was there and give people a sense of that history a little bit.
 Okay, on the next slide we have another site that's interpreted the historic history, tracing the foundations of historic house.
 This is the Governor Winthrop House in Charleston, the great house site where they used found stones and some foundation stones and brought those to the surface and
 Trace that foundation there and then just a simple lawn is a very different setting their more urban area and more extensive historic sign that you can see on the bottom right.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 We also would like to stabilize the surface in a very simple way with ground cover planting.
 There's already a little bit of that there with a vinca that's taken over, naturalized the site a little bit.
 And on the next slide, we'd like to add to that a little bit with a nice native plant, gold star.
 It's native, shade-tolerant, a lot of trees around, pretty low, 6-12 inches tall, and has a nice bloom from the late spring into the fall.
 You can imagine walking on this path and coming across these blocks and a little burst of flowers might be a pretty elegant, beautiful, but yet subtle way to think about this site.
 On the next slide, we talked about another way that we could use plants to bring back the history.
 This is Syringa vulgaris, a common lilac, which is for hundreds of years been part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 And the quote on the bottom here is from the
 Medford paper in 1912, that some of the historic research which the state did, which predated the master plan, they pulled together, and I'll just read the quote, beside the street, Grove Street, and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 So they're talking about Palm's Wall and they're talking about Grove Street, which by the looks of this was originally bordered with lilac.
 So wouldn't it be neat, the upper right image is of the Arnold Arboretum on Lilac Sunday.
 Pro tip, that's a great place to go.
 Amazingly,
 blooms in the middle of May.
 We'd like to bring those lilacs back at the wall.
 On the next slide, we can see a picture of the wall.
 This is looking right up Grove Street and Palm's wall over on the right hand side with a field stone wall next to it.
 And on the next slide, just a little illustration of what some lilacs would look like right behind that wall.
 It would look pretty nice for vehicles or people on the sidewalk over on the other side here.
 It's a nice southern orientation there, southwest orientation.
 So I think those lilacs would do well.
 And at the same time, we could plant some, just a low ground cover on the roadside to help stabilize that embankment there.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we have a look at the existing conditions behind Pompe's wall and up that path so this would be the history walk and then the next slide shows a little illustration of
 what that might look like with some lilacs over on the side in this simple walkway that would then loop around with a series of historic markers and then the stone blocks at the estate house to give a deeper understanding of the rich history of this site.
 Okay, on the next slide, I believe we're hopping into some information Ryan from the historical commission can share on the upcoming improvements for the second phase at the park.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=1938.088s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Obrigado, Pedro.
 Tudo bem, agora quero apenas mergulhar rapidamente na atualização de compilação da Fase 2.
 Então, só para reiterar o que Jen disse no início, temos um plano diretor para 2020, mas o documento é um documento vivo sujeito a alterações.
 Isso vai evoluir.
 Portanto, independentemente do que esteja no plano diretor, tenho certeza que alguns de vocês leram, o faseamento que estamos usando é diferente do faseamento exigido na construção.
 Portanto, para esta fase de financiamento, que foi inteiramente financiada graças a uma generosa doação da Comissão de Preservação Comunitária, pretendemos fazer uma escavação arqueológica maior, pretendemos podar algumas árvores e remover madeira morta, a Lei dos Americanos com Deficiência exigida,
 Acesso arquitetônico para cortes de meio-fio, calçada e vaga de estacionamento.
 Procuramos identificar as passadeiras marcando-as e colocando algumas placas e depois, claro, procuramos identificar este local como um parque público.
 Existem algumas coisas que estão sendo consideradas.
 Estamos a olhar, claro, para esta fronteira arqueológica de que Peter acabou de falar e que está em fase inicial de planeamento.
 E, claro, estamos considerando coisas como melhorar a definição da trilha, adicionar árvores apropriadas ao local e fazer alguns cortes de arbustos e cortes invasivos à medida que plantamos árvores.
 Mas claro, o que não está sendo considerado, ouvimos há muito tempo quando tivemos a reunião pública e ouvimos neste momento, embora esteja no plano diretor, não estamos considerando de forma alguma a horta comunitária ou a ponte ferroviária.
 Então vou deixar isso de lado para que as pessoas saibam que o que estamos pensando são coisas de baixo impacto para o parque, ok?
 Portanto, para a arqueologia, pretendemos contratar um arqueólogo para explorar o local da Casa de Thomas Brooks e as pessoas que lá vivem, tanto a família Brooks como os seus empregados contratados.
 É um tema pouco conhecido que tem sido explorado.
 O local tem muitos laços com a escravidão na Nova Inglaterra, por isso é um lugar muito importante.
 Então, antes de fazer qualquer tipo de limite que
 protege permanentemente o sítio, queremos concluir a devida diligência arqueológica sobre este assunto.
 E vamos procurar voluntários da comunidade, assim como da última vez, podemos ter pessoas nos ajudando na peneiração do solo e no trabalho de laboratório dos artefatos para que as pessoas possam vê-los.
 Portanto, certamente nos esforçaremos para isso.
 E o que concluirá o nosso trabalho com a parte arqueológica será o limite que esperamos instalar entre
 vocês sabem, o passeio histórico de Pedro e a interpretação da casa e os painéis interpretativos e tudo isso para proteger este local de qualquer tipo de impacto negativo.
 Há muita poda de árvores para fazer.
 Então, para isso estamos olhando para as preocupações mais imediatas relacionadas às 50 árvores com aproximadamente 150 anos que estão neste local.
 Destas, existem 30 árvores históricas que estão em condições relativamente boas.
 Eles precisam de poda, tipo luz de poda, e só para tirar ali, alguns galhos mortos, alguns líderes quebraram, mas tem 10
 árvores dentro e ao redor do parque que estão completamente mortas.
 Você pode ver aqui à direita esta imagem onde seus líderes estão completamente divididos e não sobrou nada e essas árvores devem ser removidas para segurança pública.
 Em outras, como na imagem mais à esquerda, você pode ver que o líder se separou e está pendurado precariamente sobre algumas trilhas.
 Então estamos procurando
 Apare-os todos para que o cercadinho fique seguro de uma ponta à outra.
 E há dois bordos invasores da Noruega que estão completamente mortos.
 Eles se elevam sobre o local.
 Eles têm cerca de 6 metros de altura, mas têm apenas 15 anos de idade.
 Aqueles que esperamos remover porque são, qualquer árvore desse tamanho é um incômodo e contorna o direito de passagem da MBTA.
 Mas com toda aquela poda de árvores,
 Esperamos plantar 15 novas árvores.
 E eu digo carvalhos, mas falando com o City Tree Warden, poderia ser um carvalho, poderiam ser bordos-açucareiros, árvores que são nativas da Nova Inglaterra e nativas deste local que queremos substituir os bordos invasores da Noruega que estão aqui e temos um plano para continuar a plantar árvores que serão curadas, por assim dizer, para que o parque se torne um parque e mantenha aquela sensação de floresta.
 Agora, como parte deste projeto, uma das peças-chave mais importantes é que procuramos remover toda a madeira morta de todo o local.
 Portanto, sabemos que alguns pedaços de madeira morta foram removidos da rua quando ocorreu a tempestade de gelo na Grove Street.
 O DPW tem minado isso.
 Vamos concluir esse trabalho.
 E depois, claro, houve várias árvores que foram derrubadas durante o muro por razões de segurança pública.
 Todos esses serão eliminados.
 E então todos os vários excrementos de árvores provenientes de árvores históricas moribundas ou mortas serão removidos de uma extremidade à outra do parque.
 Então será uma limpeza total de cima para baixo.
 Grande parte desse material, se for muito grande, será removido do local.
 Se for menor,
 e pode ser triturado, colocaremos um pouco disso de volta na estrada para que haja alguma definição nas estradas.
 Para melhorias de acessibilidade, temos vários espalhados pelo parque.
 O mais importante é que iremos reconectar a calçada ao longo do lado leste da Grove Street, que atualmente termina na Newton Street, até a nova entrada na Jackson Road.
 Faremos cortes de calçada em todas as aberturas das paredes.
 Haverá passarelas listradas em Jackson Road, Gravine Road e Layard Road.
 Haverá sinalização para travessias de pedestres.
 E, claro, tudo isto levará muito tempo porque há muitos intervenientes importantes.
 Então, estamos explorando e trabalhando em projetos e conceitos, mas o departamento de obras públicas da cidade, o departamento de trânsito, todos eles têm que entrar em ação à medida que começamos a avançar com este projeto.
 Então, estamos apenas começando e ainda faltam muitos, muitos meses.
 mas esperamos começar a construção talvez na primavera de 2025 para que possamos basicamente começar o ano com o pé direito e no primeiro período de construção possível após o inverno começaremos e entregaremos essas coisas nas quais estamos trabalhando há mais de um ano.
 Para obter espaço, eles precisarão ser marcados em algum lugar próximo como parte da rota acessível e do caminho acessível ao redor do parque, uma vaga única de estacionamento.
 Quando estávamos originalmente desenvolvendo o plano diretor, fomos solicitados a manter os carros fora do parque.
 Portanto, temos que fornecer um espaço acessível para ADA em algum lugar.
 Trabalharemos com os moradores, todos vocês, para tentar localizá-lo em um local que seja conveniente tanto para a rota acessível quanto para os moradores.
 Mas também exige que a cidade realize uma audiência pública com o departamento de trânsito.
 Portanto, haverá muitas, muitas mais oportunidades para abordar onde e como este espaço se enquadra.
 E claro,
 Os pensamentos mudaram.
 Existe acesso.
 Não é preferível, mas poderíamos mover a vaga de estacionamento de volta para o local, se necessário.
 Para marcar calçadas, queremos mantê-lo simples.
 Você sabe, uma simples calçada pintada serve.
 Sinalização ao mínimo.
 Conversamos com o departamento de trânsito outro dia.
 A preferência talvez por um letreiro luminoso, se houver, seria Jackson Road.
 onde há uma grande concentração de pessoas atravessando em direção à entrada principal do parque, talvez até mesmo uma rota segura para os residentes que vão e voltam da escola.
 Mas dependendo do que ouvimos como feedback, isso está em discussão.
 E então, a sinalização do parque. Existem dois tipos diferentes de sinalização de parque.
 Existem as placas que dão as boas-vindas ao passeio histórico e as placas interpretativas.
 Mas realmente, para esta fase, procuramos identificar o parque como parque.
 E esperamos ter algo semelhante à placa da Brooks Estate na mesma rua.
 Este site está relacionado ao
 Propriedade da Brooks Estate, mas pode ter identidade própria.
 Portanto, ainda não temos um design verdadeiro, mas temos algo que o identifica como um parque urbano com alguma história, para que todos saibam que não é apenas um pedaço de floresta abandonado, que é realmente um lugar importante para Medford.
 E depois, claro, com planeamento contínuo, há coisas que estamos a considerar como parte deste projeto que levarão a outros projetos.
 Temos trabalhos históricos em árvores.
 A certa altura, há um beco de carvalhos e nozes pretas que gostaríamos de abrir e.
 talvez reduzir alguns dos invasores bordos da Noruega.
 Mas estamos ouvindo e entendemos que atualmente a vegetação funciona como uma espécie de tela sonora.
 Então, como parte disso, falaríamos sobre talvez plantar algumas árvores para que as árvores maiores e mais apropriadas possam aumentar de tamanho enquanto a paisagem existente diminui.
 E para que esse buffer de som seja sempre mantido.
 Mas, novamente, esta é uma fase posterior, muitas, muitas, muitas, muitas eliminações.
 Mas o maior deles é que parte do trabalho de árvore que está sendo feito irá aliviar os danos à cerca da MBTA.
 Portanto, faremos com que a MBTA trabalhe conosco para consertar a cerca, para que o parque fique seguro, para que ninguém possa cruzar o leito da ferrovia quando tudo estiver dito e feito.
 E esse é o cerne do que estamos fazendo para a fase dois.
 Portanto, sabemos que você tem comentários e perguntas.
 Então acho que se você quiser comentar ou tiver alguma dúvida para nós, ficaremos felizes em respondê-la.
 Pedimos apenas que as pessoas levantem a mão.
 E, claro, não é necessário fazer todos os comentários esta noite.
 Não é o fim de tudo.
 Vamos tentar continuar com o trabalho de campo arqueológico, que não
 qualquer impacto no parque além de cavar e cavar e depois tampar e alguns trabalhos de árvore por razões de segurança, mas o resto do trabalho novamente em seis meses para finalizar o projeto, então aceitaremos comentários e ficaremos felizes em receber e-mails se você souber que as coisas surgirão mais tarde e se quiser reservar algum tempo para digerir o que ouviu esta noite e colocá-lo em
 E claro, como falei no início da reunião, se não tivermos seu e-mail, se você não estiver em nossa lista de contatos, envie-nos um e-mail e teremos prazer em adicioná-lo em nossos e-mails e publicidade.</p>

 Obrigado, Pedro.
 E como Ryan disse, estou feliz em abrir espaço para comentários ou perguntas neste momento.

 14 Newton Road em West Medford, no lado sul do Thomas Brook Park.
 Muito brevemente, quero apenas agradecer a todos pela atenção, pela escuta da comunidade, pelas tentativas e pelo trabalho árduo para preservar o que há de histórico e endémico nesta zona.
 Eu só quero dizer obrigado.
 Obviamente, sua apresentação exigiu muito trabalho.
 Você está claramente ouvindo a comunidade e eu adoro o que você está fazendo e realmente aprecio isso.
 Então, muito obrigado por todo o seu trabalho duro.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2683.696s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muito obrigado.
 Dave, vejo sua mão se você quiser ativar o som.
 Podemos obter seu nome e endereço para registro, por favor?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2691.141s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: Então a minha pergunta é: alguma coisa foi levada em consideração?
 O que está acontecendo e acontece desde muito antes de morarmos aqui, as pessoas que vão ao parque simplesmente cortam ali e o muro do nosso lado não está acabado.
 Isso é um pouco chato para nós que moramos aqui.
 Muitas pessoas simplesmente cortam a grama, cortam a grama, cortam a calçada.
 E minha opinião é que se essa parte do muro não for concluída, as pessoas do nosso lado da rua até a High Street, todos naquela área, continuarão a passar por nossa propriedade e por Brooks Estate dessa forma.
 E menos pessoas usarão todos os objetivos que você tem com os diferentes
 Hum, você sabe, os locais e os corredores e tudo mais.
 Então não sei se tem se falado em terminar aquela parte do muro do nosso lado de onde moramos.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2766.663s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Então, posso fazer um comentário e Ryan provavelmente também quer intervir.
 Ouvimos muitos comentários sobre esse fim do muro.
 E exatamente pelo motivo que você está falando, que foi o motivo pelo qual estava fechado naquele local, porque as pessoas atravessavam propriedades privadas para entrar no parque.
 E por isso e pelas linhas de visão do ponto de vista do trânsito, a abertura foi elevada para que houvesse uma forma mais fácil de atravessar a rua.
 Agora sabemos que não é ideal ter que ziguezaguear de um lado para o outro.
 E é por isso que nesta próxima fase vamos alargar o passeio do mesmo lado da rua até à abertura que agora existe para que as pessoas não tenham de atravessar de um lado para o outro.
 Eles também não precisam atravessar a entrada de sua garagem, Dave, e entrar em sua propriedade para chegar à área gramada do parque.
 Então, estamos trabalhando nisso, entendemos e ouvimos as frustrações das pessoas na extremidade inferior da Grove Street e nessas ruas laterais, e estamos tentando tornar mais fácil para as pessoas daquele lado da rua não terem que atravessar a rua duas vezes.
 E Ryan, fique à vontade para intervir.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2841.618s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Sim, nós apenas, você sabe, definitivamente queremos colocar aquela calçada.
 Deliberadamente deixamos a parede um metro e meio atrás apenas para ter certeza de que havia espaço para colocar uma calçada.
 E haverá, você sabe, uma árvore daquele lado em que a parede se curva, então ela desaparecerá.
 E acho que há um sinal de lombada que precisará ser ajustado.
 Mas depois haverá um passeio agradável e acolhedor até à entrada principal.
 Vai ficar claro que, você sabe, se houver alguma sinalização na faixa de pedestres e, você sabe, se colocarmos alguma sinalização luminosa, por assim dizer, para que as pessoas saibam à noite ou quando há pouca luz que é uma faixa de pedestres, será mais óbvio descer até a entrada principal do parque e parar ali.
 Você sabe, atualmente é,
 É um caminho de desejo, mas se dermos às pessoas uma alternativa limpa e mantida, aos poucos ele se resolverá.
 Assim como na extremidade oposta do parque, também fechamos a outra extremidade na ponte ferroviária da Grove Street por razões de segurança pública.
 E novamente os moradores escalaram o muro porque as pessoas estavam fazendo isso, mas parece que tudo se resolveu sozinho.
 Então achamos que com o tempo isso também acontecerá.
 resolver sozinho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2930.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Zoe, estou vendo sua mão.
 Se você puder nos fornecer seu nome e endereço registrados, por favor.
 Sim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2935.229s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Sou Zoe Moutsos, da Avenida Johnson, 33.
 Olá, Dave.
 Vizinho de Dave.
 E eu sou um infrator que atravessa sua propriedade para entrar no parque.
 Quero falar sobre as pessoas que estão em nossa ilha de Tyler e Johnson Ave.
 e é por isso que fazemos isso.
 Na planta original que vi havia uma entrada na Newton Road, e isso teria sido ótimo.
 Não sei por que isso foi removido ou por que não aconteceu, mas moramos em uma parte de Medford que simplesmente não tem acesso fácil a espaços verdes.
 Nossos filhos têm que atravessar várias ruas movimentadas e assustadoras.
 Para começar a brincar, ele disse que estamos literalmente atravessando uma ferrovia e viramos esse caminho para a direita para chegar a este pequeno parque.
 Vamos atravessar, você sabe, a menos que possamos caminhar até o supermercado e entrar no parque.
 Você sabe, estamos atravessando a Grove Street, que é como uma rodovia.
 Então eu acho que esse é o motivo.
 É por isso que não me lembro qual a linguagem que Ryan usou, é por isso que as pessoas estão caminhando nessa direção, e é por isso que ficamos tão decepcionados quando o plano não foi seguido e foi fechado.
 Acho que poderíamos ter feito algo lá para derrubar algumas daquelas árvores e permitir que as pessoas entrassem e não andassem na propriedade de Dave, porque eu entendo que isso, isso não é,
 Adequado não é o ideal, mas o que nos resta é a opção de correr no trânsito com crianças e cães no escuro e mal iluminado, caminhando por um caminho. Duvido que esse caminho seja largo o suficiente para ser compatível com a ADA nas ruas.
 Não consigo imaginar que seja.
 E agora está cheio de buracos, está cheio de vidro, é mesmo,
 Grande parte desse parque é muito bonito e sei que será maravilhoso quando estiver concluído, mas é uma grande decepção, pelo menos para mim, na Johnson Ave, e conheço outras pessoas na área que estão essencialmente, novamente, presas em uma rodovia de ruas onde as pessoas aceleram.
 E não conseguimos chegar ao espaço verde mais próximo que temos.
 Então, acho que o que quero dizer é que talvez pudéssemos considerar colocar a Newton Road que deveria estar lá.
 E também, além de todo o meu discurso retórico sobre isso, obrigado por ouvir.
 Há muitos invasores naquele parque.
 Tem verruga negra, mostarda com alho, hera venenosa, conforme necessário, como se os invasores não fossem só os noruegueses, certo?
 Então, estou me perguntando: quando há pessoas lá, existe um plano para lidar com esses invasores?
 Porque, meu Deus, mostarda de alho dos últimos dois anos, se você gosta desse tipo,
 limpeza do parque.
 Não sei do que estamos falando.
 Nós realmente não prestamos muita atenção a essa área nesta apresentação, mas a área livre perto da Newton Road, se você olhar, agora é quase toda mostarda de alho e verruga preta.
 Isso só vai continuar a piorar.
 De qualquer forma, obrigado.
 Eu sei que vai ser ótimo, mas eu realmente adoraria pensar sobre uma entrada segura e o fato de que Grove Street é realmente perigosa.
 As pessoas dirigem muito rápido naquela estrada.
 Obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3125.498s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Obrigado Zoe.
 E também moro na Grove Street, então posso ouvir você perfeitamente.
 Gostaria apenas de falar com John Ardizzone, porque vejo sua mão levantada, e já vi isso antes, e sei que você não está usando a mão no Zoom.
 Então, eu só queria evitar que você levantasse a mão.
 Então, John, se você quiser ativar seu som e se pudermos obter seu nome e endereço para registro, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3147.976s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: John art mora na 53 Johnson Avenue há apenas 30 anos.
 Então eu conheço toda a história deste parque.
 e sou dono do número 69 da Grove Street.
 Meu inquilino é David.
 As pessoas andam pela minha garagem até o parque, não deveria ser assim.
 Era para estar trancado.
 Essa é apenas uma pergunta.
 O outro problema é todo esse processo de ganhar tanto, tem muito trânsito nessa rua e você está colocando cada vez mais trânsito nela.
 A outra coisa é que estamos falando de pessoas que trazem seus filhos.
 É estritamente um parque para cães.
 Eu sou um deles, estou aqui há mais tempo que qualquer outra pessoa nesta foto.
 Peter, Ryan, alguma dessas pessoas veio.
 Eles não estão lá há tanto tempo quanto eu.
 Eu estava lá quando era uma horta da vitória, quando havia hortas comunitárias lá.
 Foi lindo.
 Você está falando sobre quando eles construíram o muro, eles destruíram todas as plantas que estavam atrás daqueles muros e todas as árvores.
 Os caras que fizeram a parede deveriam levantá-la com cuidado, como fizeram no topo do supermercado.
 Esses caras simplesmente derrubaram.
 Eles fizeram pilhas de pedras.
 A outra coisa é que você está falando sobre sua visão ser muito sensível.
 Eles pegaram cinco ou dez rodas de pedra de três quartos de polegada na minha garagem, quebraram-nas e jogaram-nas no campo.
 Bem?
 Aquela pedra deveria ser usada como base daquele lindo muro que eles construíram.
 Eles nunca usaram nenhuma pedra.
 Quando terminaram, entraram com uma retroescavadeira e nivelaram a coisa.
 Eu trabalho na área.
 Trabalho na área há 30 anos.
 Eu conheço a história disso.
 Você está falando sobre canais e sobre escavações arqueológicas.
 A cidade, a cidade, corta a grama ali e vandaliza o local há anos.
 Costumava ser muito tranquilo na Grove Street.
 Agora tudo que você faz é ouvir os trens porque você removeu todo o lixo em volta daquelas pedras.
 Você tem que literalmente entrar e cortar 6 metros atrás daquela parede, derrubar todas as paredes ali.
 Eles não começaram assim.
 Quando eles começaram a ponte, eles a deixaram bonita e organizada.
 Eles até usam pedra no começo.
 Estou no ramo de construção.
 Eu sei.
 Quando você estiver a um terço do caminho, esqueça a pedra.
 Esqueça de contornar as árvores.
 Eles simplesmente destruíram tudo.
 Agora há uma bagunça lá atrás.
 O que você deveria ter feito é apenas limpar o parque.
 O barulho, a bebida, você quer tirar o bolso das pessoas.
 Mas o problema é que todas essas pessoas estão falando sobre como isso é maravilhoso.
 Eles não moram ao lado.
 Isso não os afeta.
 Você abriu um caminho.
 Meu amigo Mike David, sua esposa é minha sobrinha.
 Tem gente lá embaixo às 10 da noite, passeando com os cachorros.
 Não há crianças, as únicas crianças que brincam naquele parque moram na casa ao lado do 69 Grove.
 Eles vão lá, são garotos do lacrosse.
 Não há crianças lá, é um parque para cães.
 Ok, cheio de merda de cachorro.
 Você está falando de um lugar grande que deseja manter bonito e limpo.
 Você deixa cachorros cagarem lá há 30 anos.
 Ninguém conhece a história desta propriedade.
 Você está falando sobre história, sobre água.
 Você tem uma servidão de água em Massachusetts passando por lá.
 Há uma servidão MBTA ao lado da minha casa.
 Eu sou o único verdadeiro co-autor dessa propriedade.
 Você nunca me avisou.
 É tipo, por quê?
 Falei com o departamento de trânsito.
 Você vai colocar uma faixa de pedestres no final da minha garagem?
 O que acontecerá então quando alguém desistir?
 Se eles recuarem, estarão na faixa de pedestres novamente.
 As faixas de pedestres devem estar a 36 metros de uma estrutura existente, a menos que seja necessário.
 Não exige isso.
 Você vai caminhar, as pessoas vão caminhar e para onde elas vão?
 Você está falando e outra pessoa disse que é o único lugar para crianças.
 Medford tem mais espaços verdes.
 Meu filho é um animal selvagem.
 Conheça todos os espaços verdes desta cidade.
 Temos mais espaços verdes em Medford, Mystic Lakes e Brooks Estates.
 Deve haver 100 acres lá atrás.
 Você tem que atravessar a rua para um espaço verde.
 As pessoas têm muita sorte de viver em West Medford.
 E o que acontece é que eles estão destruindo isso fazendo coisas assim.
 Entre lá e limpe o parque.
 Minha parede de entrada, por que você não a completa?
 Você vai fazer um muro, vai colocar uma calçada, é só pegar, mandar seu pessoal amanhã e terminar o muro.
 Por que você não faz isso?
 Você acha que se você mora no supermercado 69 e sai e alguém passa atrás do seu carro, você ficaria louco.
 Às 10 da noite, tem gente passeando com seus cachorros.
 Não está no seu quintal, então não te incomoda.
 Uma pessoa mora em Jackson Road, uma pessoa mora em Tyler, uma pessoa mora em John.
 Nenhuma dessas pessoas está lá há tanto tempo quanto eu.
 Eu estava lá, nunca houve problema.
 Lindo bairro.
 As florestas eram muito melhores do que são agora.
 Você não cuidou deles durante anos.
 De vez em quando, você cortava a grama deles.
 Aquela abertura, aquela entrada, era uma abertura muito pequena.
 O que aconteceu foi que eles removeram as pedras grandes para poder colocar os cortadores de grama.
 Foi assim que tudo começou.
 Sou dono daquela casa desde 2003 e moro na Johnson Avenue há 30 anos.
 Acabei de vender minha casa lá e ainda possuo o 69 Grocery.
 Já fiz contatos.
 O departamento de trânsito virá aqui.
 Eles não querem problemas lá.
 Nunca tivemos problemas na Avenida Johnson.
 Eles destruíram a outra parte onde a Avenida Johnson encontra o supermercado.
 Eles destruíram aquela área.
 Nunca houve nenhum acidente lá.
 Juan, muito obrigado por seus comentários.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3494.426s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Preciso passar para alguns outros comentários agora.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3496.549s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Você deveria ter me avisado.
 Você nunca me avisou.
 Eu sou o único vizinho.
 Eu nunca irei notificá-lo.
 Recebo notificações de pessoas da vizinhança.
 Você sabe o que eles fazem?
 Você pode roubar os bolsos das pessoas.
 Não está no seu quintal, então não te incomoda.
 E é isso que é tudo.
 Você quer plantas invasoras.
 Você está desenterrando coisas e aqueles caras destruíram o lugar e você diz que é uma coisa delicada.
 Eu permitiria que você chegasse à minha propriedade com 510 510 rodas de pedra e as jogasse lá sem sequer me perguntar.
 Ele tinha a polícia lá.
 Eles disseram, ei, se eles quebrarem a entrada, eles terão que consertar.
 Quem permitiu isso?</p>

 Eu moro em 56 Grove, então sou um dos vizinhos que John diz.
 Então eu moro muito perto do parque, mais perto do que John morava.
 Meu neto brinca lá o tempo todo.
 Ele tem 10 anos.
 Ele o usou extensivamente.
 Vejo outras crianças lá também, então sei que é usado.
 Certamente as pessoas também levam seus cachorros para passear lá, mas fora isso, apenas algumas coisas.
 Em primeiro lugar, muito obrigado.
 Acho que é uma melhoria importante.
 Estou feliz que você esteja limpando tudo.
 Madeira morta e eu sempre me preocupo com um incêndio nelas por causa de toda a madeira morta e árvores mortas.
 Então isso é uma grande melhoria.
 E eu gosto de tudo que você está fazendo.
 A única coisa que me decepciona um pouco, porque acho que no plano inicial você disse que seriam calçadas cinzentas e parece que você se afastou disso.
 Então ainda é uma possibilidade?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3602.83s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Então, conversamos sobre fazer calçadas elevadas com o departamento de trânsito e o problema é que envolve a instalação de uma bacia de captação, o que agrega um custo monumental.
 Se já não houver um lá.
 E na maioria dos casos, não há nenhuma perto do local onde propomos a passadeira.
 Então estamos focando no obstáculo que existe aí.
 Poderíamos trabalhar com o trânsito para tentar colocar outro.
 A outra coisa sobre a qual conversamos com eles foi talvez estabelecer uma zona de segurança ao longo da borda do parque para que o limite de velocidade, em vez de ser 25 em toda a cidade, fosse mais
 tipo 20 milhas por hora.
 Mas sabemos que as pessoas aceleram nesta estrada, que as linhas de visão são um problema e que algumas pessoas querem torná-la segura fazendo com que reduzam a velocidade.
 E sabemos que é um atalho no caminho para chegar a alguns lugares.
 Eu mesmo passei por aqui vindo de outras partes de Medford, mas talvez fazer com que as pessoas diminuam a velocidade ajude a torná-lo mais seguro.
 Talvez até usá-lo com sinalização ajude.
 torná-lo um pouco mais seguro.
 Mas se pudermos colocar calçadas elevadas, nós o faremos.
 Mas caso contrário, faremos o oposto e apenas garantiremos que seja acessível com as rampas de ambos os lados.</p>

 Moro em 11 Newton Road, em frente ao parque, One House Inn.
 Penso que concordo com todos os oradores aqui, pelo menos num sentido, que é, muito obrigado por esta apresentação.
 Estou realmente impressionado e orgulhoso por estarmos olhando para a história de Medford e sendo muito atenciosos com ela.
 Então, obrigado por esse trabalho.
 Fazendo eco a John, gostaria de dizer que penso que a sensibilização da comunidade é fundamental.
 Sinto que se não tivesse assinado o seu boletim informativo e não estivesse interessado neste tópico, não teria ouvido falar desta reunião esta noite.
 E acho que há muitas pessoas interessadas na comunidade que simplesmente não estão cientes de que as decisões estão sendo tomadas.
 Então, não sei se isso significa literalmente como
 Olhando o bairro do ponto de vista do John, acho que não há muita transparência na tomada de decisões e há muito interesse.
 Uh, manteigas e membros da comunidade que eu acho que gostariam pelo menos de ter consciência, se não a capacidade de, você sabe, falar em reuniões.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3777.742s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Posso interromper rapidamente e fazer uma pergunta ao público em geral?
 Para aqueles de vocês aqui, algum de vocês recebeu uma ligação reversa para o 911 porque pedimos à cidade para fazer uma há cerca de duas semanas e se uma não foi feita, eu sei que eles colocaram no calendário da cidade, mas eu pedi para eles?
 uma ligação reversa só para divulgar, sabe, queremos ter certeza de que você sabe que existem outras maneiras para as pessoas que você conhece, postei isso nas redes sociais, a cidade colocou na agenda deles, mas sim, sabemos que nem todo mundo está no Facebook, nem todo mundo está nas redes sociais, então você sabe, queremos ter certeza de que pegaremos pessoas como você, John, que você conheceria, ouvindo o telefone e respondendo a mensagem como aquela que todo mundo costumava fazer.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3819.423s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: E eu consegui um, mas quero dizer, moro do outro lado do Grove e estou inscrito nos alertas da cidade.
 Então todos estão cadastrados para receber os alertas da cidade?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3826.977s">[Zoe Moutsos]</a>: Sim, não recebi nenhum.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3829.032s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ok, então vamos verificar porque solicitamos especificamente. Quer dizer, eu sei que foi cancelado porque eu o recebi.
 Mas de que adianta isso? Quer dizer, estou organizando uma reunião.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3836.496s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Então, se eu pudesse resumidamente, se você se inscreveu para receber alertas da cidade e não o fez, e está nesta área e não recebeu mensagem, pode não ter seu endereço no sistema.
 E isso é algo que identificamos como um problema.
 Para isso você pode acessar os alertas no site da cidade.
 Você pode personalizar, seja no seu celular, se for uma mensagem de texto, você pode receber no e-mail, pode receber no telefone fixo no papel, não no papel.
 Mas se você não tiver seu endereço lá, não receberá mensagens localizadas como esta.
 Então, eu só queria que as pessoas percebessem isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3876.048s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sim, eu sei que é difícil e sei que ninguém consegue mais um emprego, mas quero dizer, com certeza existem maneiras, tanto da velha escola quanto das redes sociais.
 Só sei que é muito difícil se concentrar nessas reuniões e tem tanta gente interessada nesse parque, nesse bairro.
 Acho que eles apreciariam mais conscientização.
 Então, se você pudesse colocar um pouco mais de esforço em caminhos diferentes para pelo menos
 espalhe a palavra.
 Eu acho que seria útil.
 Quero reiterar novamente a outro comentarista o fechamento da entrada da Newton Road.
 Obviamente, como pessoa da Newton Road, sinto muita falta disso.
 Isso realmente torna o final do parque quase um beco sem saída.
 para o lado sul, não só para acesso, mas também para diversão.
 Poucas pessoas vão para o meio do parque e depois voltam para aquela área, que na verdade era, até fecharem, a entrada, a entrada para literalmente todos do lado sul.
 E ouço a frustração de John e também a frustração do inquilino.
 todo mundo está frustrado.
 Você sabe, nós o queremos de volta.
 Queremos que a entrada volte apenas para abrir toda a extensão do parque.
 Então eu sei que é uma mensagem bastante consistente que quase todo mundo na vizinhança
 Além talvez de John e do direito de receber apoio.
 Mas, você sabe, basta fazer uma entrada que todos tiveram de volta.
 E então, e então meu, meu, meu comentário, que eu acho que é único e não foi dito até agora.
 Mais uma vez, acho que planejar é ótimo.
 Eu acho que o que você está fazendo é ótimo.
 Minha preocupação é sempre a manutenção e o status futuro.
 Uma coisa é ter um parque lindo feito e belas fotos, mas como vimos, se você não tem orçamento ou não pensa em mantê-lo,
 Pode ficar muito ruim em muito pouco tempo.
 Portanto, considere que, ao planejar, há um item em seu orçamento ou em seu pensamento sobre como mantê-lo o mais bonito possível no dia em que você fizer isso.
 Então, obrigado.
 Obrigado, Diana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4024.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Eu só quero pular para essa nota.
 E acho que esta é uma boa filosofia que toda a cidade deveria ter.
 Eu trataria esta paisagem como trataria um edifício histórico.
 Quanto mais manutenção e preservação você fizer, menos exigirá manutenção e atualização, por assim dizer.
 Então, sim, estamos avançando com a limpeza do parque na esperança de que ele permaneça limpo, bem conservado e bem utilizado para que receba o orçamento que merece.</p>

 Há muitas coisas acontecendo.
 Eu gosto do plano geral.
 Parece bom.
 Existem muitas árvores Widowmaker por aí.
 É como fazer um projeto em casa, certo?
 As bandeiras arqueológicas ainda estão lá.
 Então isso é lixo.
 Você percorre esses caminhos.
 Estou nesta floresta pelo menos 30 minutos por dia, todos os dias.
 Meu filho e eu saímos e tivemos que limpar todos os cacos de vidro que os construtores do muro jogaram e que estão no caminho.
 Ainda não estamos nem perto.
 Se você sair e quiser fazer uma calçada do lado do Bosque, esse lado não é largo o suficiente.
 Agora você não terá um caminho largo o suficiente.
 Portanto, o muro deveria ter sido empurrado naquele ponto para aliviar os problemas de John.
 E concordo, deveria haver uma entrada sul, 100%.
 Os restos de árvores que ainda estão lá levam toda a vizinhança a ir até o Bosque para jogar lá o próprio lixo.
 Está se transformando em uma pilha de lixo repetidas vezes.
 Eu concordo sobre espécies invasoras.
 Saímos e jogamos mostarda de alho o tempo todo.
 Eu faço isso em cada passeio com o cachorro.
 Eu bebo mostarda de alho enquanto ele cheira, você sabe, e há definitivamente áreas onde fizemos a diferença, mas
 Toda esta área costumava ser muito bonita.
 Agora há montes de lama porque a estrada está suja e profunda.
 Há vidro.
 Não consigo superar a quantidade de vidro que quebrou a parede.
 É ridículo.
 Há muito mais que pode ser feito.
 Mas, para preocupação de todos, este não é um parque público.
 Este é um parque local.
 Isto não será uma atração para as pessoas virem nos visitar.
 Eu moro em frente ao muro.
 talvez quatro vezes por ano, vejo alguém parar na Grove Street, subir e ler a placa.
 Você sabe o que eu quero dizer?
 Então eu agradeço muito a ideia de melhorar, mas acho que você só precisa se avaliar na hora de saber se não vai haver empate.
 ao público em geral.
 Você sabe o que eu quero dizer?
 Portanto, o mais importante é a opinião das pessoas ao seu redor, seja diretamente ou nas estradas ao seu redor.
 Quero dizer, se vai haver um jardim da vitória lá e... O jardim da vitória está fora de questão.
 Bem, isso é bom porque temos tido conversas internas sobre isso porque tivemos problemas com ratos em toda a área.
 Então, está tudo bem.
 Então isso era uma coisa, mas, você sabe, o campo quase não é aparado, talvez duas vezes por ano.
 Mesmo vindo de vocês, ainda há muito cascalho.
 Então, outro dia, literalmente tirei o fundo de um cone do parque e coloquei-o na beira da estrada, esperando que alguém da cidade finalmente viesse buscá-lo.
 Porque está lá desde que o muro foi construído.
 Hum, eu vi uma vez na solução C clicks, alguém reclamou de despejar lá.
 E acho que isso se transformou em uma discussão com quem veio vê-lo, mas
 Quer dizer, se você não fizer isso, se você começar um projeto e deixá-lo como lixo, as pessoas vão se virar e pensar, ah, isso ainda é lixo.
 Posso fazer o que quiser com isso.
 Portanto, parece que o projeto foi iniciado, mas não concluído na primeira fase.
 Você sabe, com as bandeiras em volta da guarda, é nojento estar lá.
 Eu costumava ser muito mais legal antes de o muro começar a ser honesto com você.
 Espero que o plano que você traçou se concretize e desapareça.
 Eu adoraria, sabe, espero que ainda esteja no quadro, a ponte para o parque, porque mais uma vez as pessoas têm que caminhar até o topo.
 As crianças têm que caminhar ao redor da Grove Street e contorná-la.
 Vou te dizer uma coisa, Mike, há uma cerca derrubada.
 Meu filho atravessa os trilhos do trem, você sabe, porque é quase mais seguro do que subir e dobrar a esquina do Grove para descer até o centro de recreação.
 Você sabe, essas são minhas preocupações.
 Existem muitos deles.
 Eu deveria ter feito uma lista, mas provavelmente levaria 30 minutos.
 Mas com certeza envolveria mais os cariocas, sabe, porque se você não mora por aqui, não vai vir a esse parque.
 Você sabe, isto não é um estacionamento.
 Isto não é um chupão.
 Isso não é nada disso.
 Então.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4334.142s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muito obrigado e fique à vontade para nos enviar um email se você pensar em mais coisas.
 Você sabe, esta é uma conversa contínua.
 E tenho mais um ponto.
 Espere, João.
 John, preciso disso, tenho outras pessoas que levantaram a mão então gostaria de deixar um comentário.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4351.289s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Muito rápido.
 Diane estava falando sobre seu filho andando pela calçada e trazendo as pessoas que caminhavam até lá.
 Como alguém se sentiria se morasse lá?
 E eles tinham filhos, e havia pessoas andando pela calçada.
 Minha privacidade está lá dentro.
 E por que não fecham o muro e colocam a abertura no meio da rua?
 Não entendo por que eles simplesmente não fazem isso.
 Feche aquele muro amanhã e abra-o na Grove Street.
 E aquela calçada, como eu estou certo, essa calçada não é larga o suficiente para fazer aquela calçada.
 E a parede era um trabalho terrível, e há uma bagunça lá dentro.
 E está mais barulhento do que antes, porque todo aquele lixo saiu de lá.
 Eles precisam voltar para a fase 1.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4392.777s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Obrigado, João.
 Muito obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4397.678s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Antes que as pessoas intervenham, deixe-me oferecer alguns esclarecimentos, que podem ajudar.
 Portanto, na discussão sobre fechar esse fim, há algumas coisas diferentes.
 Não podíamos colocar faixa de pedestres ali porque já existe faixa de pedestres.
 Não queremos pessoas atravessando a entrada.
 Mas além disso,
 Queremos, como mencionei antes, concentrar as pessoas no cruzamento principal da Jackson Road, por isso a calçada é necessária.
 Existem um metro e meio ao longo de toda a parede.
 Na verdade, há mais do que isso em alguns lugares, mas há um metro e meio.
 A calçada ADA deve ter 48 polegadas de parede a calçada e 36 polegadas de espaço livre.
 Nós temos isso.
 Medimos isso outro dia enquanto estávamos no
 parque.
 Em termos de custo, olhamos o custo de reabertura do muro ou o custo de alargamento da calçada.
 A calçada para Jackson Road é infinitamente mais barata, cerca de US$ 10 mil.
 Ia custar algo como
 US$ 36 mil para fazer o empreiteiro voltar, se movimentar, abrir a parede, retirar a calçada, retrair as paredes e fazer aquela abertura.
 Custará cerca de US$ 20.000 ou menos, dependendo de quanto se relaciona com o projeto maior, colocação da calçada, colocação do corte do meio-fio, colocação da faixa de pedestres e identificação.
 Então, estamos apenas tentando pesar os prós e os contras de ambos.
 comentários públicos versus também garantir que somos fiscalmente responsáveis ​​pela quantidade de dinheiro que recebemos em impostos.
 Mas, novamente, tudo isso está sujeito a discussão.
 Pessoal, é uma opinião.
 Então o trânsito pode dizer de repente: não, não faça isso.
 Voltemos à ideia de erguer o muro e faremos.
 Mas, você sabe, também temos que fornecer comodidades ADA para garantir que o parque seja acessível, porque recebemos feedback de que as pessoas querem usar o parque e somos obrigados.
 E como parte desse pré-trabalho, queríamos dizer que se formos abrir e fechar entradas, todas estarão acessíveis.
 O parque será universalmente acessível a todos, você sabe, e mesmo que não seja usado por pessoas de outras partes da comunidade, está lá para que possa estar.
 Bom.
 Então acho que o consenso geral é que mesmo que o público não venha ver, está disponível para eles se quiserem.
 Você certamente não pode fazer ninguém ou ninguém chegar a isso.
 Mas você sabe, eu.
 Vocês, como vizinhos, certamente querem que isto funcione para vocês, mas também precisamos ter certeza de que estamos fazendo tudo o que podemos para que isso funcione também para toda a cidade.
 Este é, você sabe, o M-Belt e a Royal House têm seus próprios pequenos locais, mas este é realmente o único parque da cidade que celebra qualquer parte da história.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4565.828s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Benjamin O'Cady, você pode fazer seu comentário.
 Se pudermos obter seu nome e endereço para registro, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4572.062s">[SPEAKER_06]</a>: Olá, sou Olga, Katie, sou esposa de Benjamín.
 Tenho alguns comentários que gostaria de compartilhar.
 E estamos na 38 Jackson Road.
 Então, obrigado por esta apresentação.
 E você obviamente levou a sério muitas contribuições da comunidade ao projetar a apresentação e ao voltar com outra interpretação para a fase dois.
 Então, agradeço que você ouça com atenção a comunidade, especialmente aqueles de nós que usam o parque todos os dias e estão
 atores muito ativos na sua preservação e utilidade para os membros desta comunidade.
 Os comentários que fiz referem-se especificamente ao planeamento das árvores do parque e da barreira acústica e à sua manutenção.
 Então o que notamos, meu marido e eu, nos últimos três anos que moramos aqui, é que desde que a primeira fase foi concluída, a barreira do som foi completamente destruída.
 O barulho do trem é
 É ridículo e nossa casa treme.
 Como se houvesse um mini terremoto acontecendo várias vezes ao dia devido ao tremor causado pelas árvores que foram derrubadas para a restauração do muro na primeira parte.
 Portanto, estou muito preocupado com as árvores adicionais que serão cortadas nas fases posteriores do projecto porque, embora algumas novas sejam plantadas, esperamos que o calendário não corresponda, porque o tempo que levará para essas árvores amadurecerem até ao nível
 Das árvores que estão cortadas atualmente serão 20, 30 anos.
 Portanto, antes que possam ser uma barreira sonora eficaz, levará algum tempo.
 E enquanto isso, o barulho dos trens é ridículo.
 O abalo é terrível em termos da destruição da barreira do som ocorrida.
 E está causando problemas com a fundação e apenas externalidades negativas adicionais nas quais você provavelmente não pensou inicialmente ao projetar este projeto.
 Então acho que é necessário adotar outras medidas.
 Foram tomadas medidas para reduzir o efeito da barreira sonora através do corte de árvores adicionais e quaisquer árvores plantadas devem crescer muito rapidamente para substituir essa barreira sonora.
 o mais rápido possível.
 A segunda preocupação que tenho é com relação à manutenção dessas árvores.
 Especificamente, quem gerencia esses projetos?
 É o Departamento Florestal de Medford?
 Será um arborista particular?
 Há dinheiro reservado para regar essas árvores, as novas árvores, e garantir que sobrevivam?
 Porque muitas das árvores plantadas em Medford, as novas árvores, em primeiro lugar, demoram uma eternidade a serem plantadas por razões que não vamos discutir hoje, mas também não há manutenção dessas árvores porque ninguém as rega porque não há dinheiro.
 Portanto, qualquer nova árvore plantada precisa basicamente de cuidados regulares durante pelo menos três anos para garantir que sobreviva.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4741.324s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Sim então,
 Você sabe, enquanto estou tentando pensar em boas ideias para a barreira do som, você sabe, e talvez faça sentido encontrar uma maneira de ajardinar a fronteira ao longo do lado da ferrovia com mais arbustos baixos que dissipem o ruído por todo o parque.
 E, você sabe, talvez pudéssemos aumentar o orçamento das árvores.
 Dessa forma, isso é algo que certamente podemos discutir com o Peter, que é arquiteto paisagista, que certamente poderia ajudar e analisar isso.
 E podemos resolver isso.
 Podemos tentar ver isso.
 A cerca da MBTA, como alguém mencionou, caiu.
 Queremos ter certeza de que funcionará novamente após a conclusão do trabalho da árvore.
 Feito para que ali não haja mais uma travessia insegura porque os trens, uma vez finalizada a construção, vão partir.
 Você sabe, volte a toda velocidade e nem todo mundo para por aí.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4806.644s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Então, eu odiaria falar um pouco, mas meu filho e eu podemos atestar isso porque ela zombou de mim no passado, mas.
 Na verdade, tentamos limpar a esquerda de Poms Walter Ravine para o lado da estrada e atrás dele, e na verdade arrancamos as ervas daninhas e entramos e plantamos flores nativas, como um verdadeiro jardim polinizado daquele lado.
 Tudo o que há na frente e atrás daquela parede é uma pitada de terra, não terra, terra, com nada além de rocha por baixo.
 Só o fato de termos amigos doando diferentes lírios e diferentes bulbos este ano que estamos tentando plantar no fundo do muro, sabe, ao lado, se você conhece a área, tem uma árvore, tipo uma pequena protuberância atrás do lado esquerdo do muro.
 Mas uma coisa a ter em mente é definitivamente regar, porque não tenho certeza se algum deles vai aguentar.
 Minhas sementes, coloquei $ 60 em sementes este ano, $ 80 em sementes no ano passado.
 Temos alguns que demoraram, mas odeio dizer o termo, porque tem gente que não gosta, não sei quem está aqui, mas com as mudanças climáticas tem sido um inverno muito quente e seco.
 Se você mora aqui, sabe de onde vem esse sol.
 O sol não brilha necessariamente diretamente nessa área.
 E aí está super, super seco e não tem sujeira.
 Não há chão.
 em cada lado dessa parede diretamente.
 Depois de entrar ou passar por ele, há uma tonelada de sujeira com ervas daninhas.
 Mas se você vai fazer algo decorativo, como lírios ou o que quer que sejam aquelas plantas, alguém tem que cuidar disso, principalmente com o plantio de árvores.
 Portanto, não há água direta ali.
 Pensei literalmente em pedir aos meus vizinhos para poder usar a casa deles na esquina e passar uma mangueira na casa deles do outro lado da rua.
 Acho que neste momento simplesmente não faz sentido.
 E as ervas daninhas são ridículas em todos os lugares.
 Quer dizer, a cidade vem uma vez por ano no outono e a grama destrói tudo.
 Na verdade, eu tinha um jardim que estava crescendo no ano passado e eles vieram e arrancaram ervas daninhas de tudo.
 Então, sim.
 Mas isso é tudo.
 Eu só quero ressaltar isso.
 Você terá que fazer um orçamento para outra coisa se estiver pensando em fazer isso.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=4942.083s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Muito obrigado.
 Obrigado Olga também por esses comentários e com certeza iremos revisitar o plano de paisagismo, árvores e manutenção.
 Fiz uma lista aqui e só para você saber, entraremos em contato com Peter e alguns de nossos colegas para conversar sobre isso e pensar mais profundamente sobre o assunto.
 Então, muito obrigado.
 Obrigado.
 Ok, a seguir vejo o BNIC.
 Se você puder ativar o som e nos fornecer seu nome e endereço para registro.
 Olá BNIC.
 Quer fazer um comentário?
 Você está com a mão levantada.
 Não podemos ouvi-lo se você estiver tentando falar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5002.169s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Eles se reativaram, mas não podemos ouvi-los.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5007.312s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Ok, passarei para a próxima pessoa e entrarei em contato com você.
 Diane, se você quiser fazer isso, vi sua mão levantada novamente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5014.375s">[XXXXXX00119_SPEAKER_04]</a>: Sim, sim, eu só queria abordar o comentário de Ryan sobre fazer uma análise de custos do que era, uma calçada versus uma parede.
 E, novamente, voltando ao feedback, acho que se eles tivessem perguntado antes de fechar o muro da Newton Road, poderíamos ter economizado US$ 36.000.
 Bom.
 Portanto, essa é uma frustração que acho que muitos de nós iremos abordar.
 Também acho que se você perguntar à comunidade, qual você prefere?
 Acho que todos diríamos que preferiríamos essa entrada a gastar o dinheiro.
 Por outras palavras, contacte a comunidade e obtenha volumes reais de respostas, não apenas os 20 de nós que tiveram a sorte de encontrar esta reunião.
 Faça uma enquete no Google, faça algo onde você realmente obtenha consenso antes de tomar decisões.
 Você sabe, não pedimos para você cortar esse acesso.
 Você fez isso.
 E agora pedimos que você devolva.
 E você está dizendo que seria caro, mas não é algo que você deveria ter feito em primeiro lugar.
 Essa é uma frustração real que acho que todos nós compartilhamos.
 Portanto, ouça e busque a opinião ampla da comunidade antes de tomar decisões como essa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5104.873s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Obrigado, Diana.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5211.993s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sim.
 Olá, Jen.
 E eu, você sabe, eu realmente concordo com muitos membros da nossa comunidade e ouço a frustração de John e a frustração de Diane e
 Acho que deveria haver acesso no lado sul da Grove Street que obviamente não interfira nos direitos pessoais e na propriedade pessoal de alguém.
 Então eu os ouço alto e claro.
 Sabe, John, sei que você está aqui há muito tempo, mas eu também estou aqui há mais de 20 anos.
 Você sabe, não sou um novato nesta comunidade e não é apenas um parque para cães.
 Vemos muitas crianças indo e vindo de lá.
 Eu gosto do parque.
 Eu sei que existem, você sabe,
 Relutância em mudar para muitos de nós, certo?
 Envelhecemos e chegamos a um ponto em nossas vidas em que não queremos ver muitas mudanças.
 Mas para mim, vejo-nos sentados num bairro onde temos acesso real a algo histórico.
 E também não pretendo inundar o nosso bairro com autocarros e um monte de crianças em idade escolar, ou com um afluxo maciço de pessoas em público.
 Mas, ao mesmo tempo, há uma história aqui e acho que devemos valorizá-la.
 Então, meu pensamento é, você sabe, vamos fazer como eu acho que as pessoas estão fazendo isso de uma forma cuidadosa, atenciosa e voltada para a comunidade, sem tentar introduzir muito tráfego desnecessário.
 Mas, ao mesmo tempo, esta é uma área que pode ser útil para
 Você sabe que as crianças da escola Brooks gostam de caminhar pela rua e fazer um passeio a pé um dia na primavera, onde entendem um pouco mais sobre a história desta área, o que acho muito valioso para eles aprenderem.
 E eu, entre muitas pessoas, talvez na convocação, não quero que a história seja esquecida.
 Quero que a história seja apreciada e acho que há algumas coisas realmente interessantes sobre a construção e o uso do navio.
 canal e outras coisas semelhantes que podem ter valor real.
 É tudo o que tenho a dizer, mas agradeço o cuidado e a consideração em tudo isso.
 Mas também não tenho a mesma preocupação com a mudança, desde que ela reflita a compreensão da comunidade e das pessoas de que há aqui uma parte real da história que pode ser contada e explorada de forma segura e modesta.
 Agradeço a todos que fazem o que estão fazendo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5346.996s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Obrigado, Tamara.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5388.638s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Olá Bill Stevens, Wellgate Road.
 Muito obrigado.
 Avançar.
 Como todo mundo, moro aqui há cerca de 30 anos.
 Estou um pouco preocupado porque acho que vocês avançaram em todo esse projeto sem falar com os vizinhos ou com os moradores desta comunidade.
 Também gosto de espaços verdes.
 Gosto de lagos místicos.
 Gosto deste pequeno parque que temos lá.
 Não sou fã da mudança, mas vejo o que estão tentando fazer para tornar o parque mais acessível para cadeiras de rodas e pessoas com deficiência, mas acho que
 Ninguém realmente pensou onde você pode estacionar uma van ADA ou o tipo de veículo nas ruas laterais que você propôs.
 Olho as plantas e até agora vi duas vagas de estacionamento nas ruas laterais.
 Alguém pode me explicar como eles acham que podem estacionar uma van ADA na rua lateral e permitir a entrada e saída de cadeiras de rodas?
 Alguém já pensou antes deste projeto que realmente havia progredido com as calçadas da ADA?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5452.147s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Portanto, o próximo passo para nós é pegar o projeto esquemático que temos e trabalhar com um engenheiro do departamento de trânsito, DPW e do departamento de planejamento, e realmente nos aprofundarmos nos detalhes dessa mesma questão.
 Você sabe, como isso seria viável ou não?
 estacionar uma van ou veículo ADA na rua ou no local, sabe, em algum lugar, certo?
 Então esses detalhes... Você colocou o policial antes do marido.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5489.141s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Tivemos todas essas conversas e todas essas leis de zoneamento e mudanças nos estatutos, e vocês ainda não descobriram o quão acessível este parque será para pessoas com deficiência.
 Portanto, estamos mudando toda a narrativa ao permitir que os carros estacionem no parque.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5507.249s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Bem, a comunidade nos pediu para não permitir carros no parque, mas certamente... Você não pode estacionar em uma rua lateral.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5512.773s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Precisamos de 96 polegadas de largura.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5514.875s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Correto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5515.315s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Então uma das coisas que certamente... Você não pode colocar uma rampa da lateral de uma caminhonete na calçada.
 Essa é uma passarela de residente.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5525.148s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Bem, não tenho certeza, porque teríamos que ter um engenheiro para dar uma olhada nisso, mas isso faz parte do próximo processo, agora que conseguimos o financiamento para ter os projetos.
 Preparados para que possamos pelo menos mostrá-los à comunidade para que tenhamos essas respostas específicas.
 Você sabe, este é apenas ele.
 O início dessa fase funciona, né?
 E, claro, o foco será cuidar da questão da segurança, das árvores, vocês sabem, e da arqueologia que não afeta mais nenhuma dessas outras.
 Eu não diria, você sabe, temas mais debatidos, certo?
 Então, para esses tópicos discutíveis, nós temos.
 Você sabe, pelo menos seis meses antes de sairmos para licitar ou construir.
 Então, mas queremos avançar rápido, certo?
 Então, assim que tivermos esses designs, poderemos apresentá-los à comunidade para feedback.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5580.401s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: E então... Vamos terminar por um minuto.
 O que acontece se esses designs não funcionarem?
 Gastamos três anos ou mais do dinheiro da equipe em um projeto que não pode avançar.
 Então, o que pode ser viável primeiro, antes de dedicar todo esse tempo e energia para seguir em frente?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5595.956s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Portanto, não se trata de funcionar ou não.
 É uma questão de fazer algo funcionar.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5601.962s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: Então moro aqui há 30 anos.
 Eu vi autoridades de estacionamento naquela rua.
 eu vi
 A polícia tenta diminuir a velocidade na estrada, você coloca lombadas e aquela estrada parece uma rodovia.
 Viajo por essa estrada 15 vezes por dia indo e voltando do trabalho, levando meus filhos para o trabalho e saindo para o trem.
 A estrada é uma rodovia.
 Você colocou essas placas, lombadas, nada controla a velocidade.
 Sim, realmente pensar que você pode desacelerar o caminho para alguém ir até lá de cadeira de rodas,
 alguém vai morrer.
 E eu não acho que vocês tenham pensado muito sobre isso.
 São todos cantos cegos.
 Portanto, antes de prosseguirmos, gostaria de realmente considerar antes de gastar mais dinheiro de impostos do que realmente preciso neste projeto.
 Eu sei que é um subsídio.
 Eu sei como tudo isso funciona.
 Eu sei que esta cidade está sofrendo com os trabalhadores de manutenção.
 Não temos planos de manutenção no orçamento para este imóvel.
 Faço eco da mulher que fala sobre as árvores.
 Na vizinhança, toda árvore cai na frente de cada casa.
 Toda casa tem árvores podres.
 Esta é uma terra abandonada.
 Eu só acho que vocês estão apressando esse projeto de lei, especialmente com as disposições sobre deficiência deste projeto.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5683.977s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Obrigado Bill.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5703.545s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: Sim, sou Bobby Nicotero, da 3 Newton Road e estou aqui desde sempre.
 A casa vibra no trem por volta de uma da manhã.
 algumas noites, e então, quero dizer, tudo o que todo mundo tocou aqui, desculpe-me, eu experimentei direta ou indiretamente, e devo dizer que minha esposa fez um comentário interessante quando nos mudamos para cá em 93.
 Ela disse: Bob, eu cresci em Medford, estudei na Medford High,
 Achava que sabia tudo sobre o Método, mas nem conhecia a Rose Street, nunca tinha estado aqui antes.
 E você não poderia estar mais certo.
 Esta é uma situação extremamente local, local aqui.
 E a gente fica muito sensível com isso porque moramos, eu moro aqui ao lado.
 E eu vi todas as coisas que as pessoas mencionaram.
 E seria uma pena se mudasse, para ser sincero, porque é esse o encanto que este parque e este bairro trazem às pessoas que aqui vivem.
 E as pessoas adoram isso aqui.
 Todo mundo faz isso.
 É uma ótima comunidade.
 Mas primeiro, John não poderia estar mais certo.
 Eu precisava que dois dos meus vizinhos me contassem sobre a reunião desta noite, então eles não me notificaram por algum motivo.
 Eu não culpo ninguém.
 é só isso
 Estamos em 2024, então sei que isso deveria ter sido dado pelo menos ao pessoal de Grove, e esses são melhores.
 Mas, novamente, é um parque local.
 Eu aprecio a história.
 Eu nunca saberia nada sobre o Parque Sagamore, a menos que meus filhos vagassem pelas ruas com os amigos e descobrissem que havia índios nativos nesta parte do país.
 Muito interessante sobre a história, e adoramos isso.
 Mas há um charme e um amor pela história em torno disso.
 E as pessoas respondem muito bem a tudo isso.
 Mas devo dizer que Grove Street é como uma luva para excesso de velocidade.
 Os carros parecem acelerar ou frear em ritmo acelerado.
 Infelizmente, um cachorro foi atropelado por um carro e morreu há pouco tempo em Grove.
 E foi muito, muito triste.
 E ele voltou para casa.
 E, você sabe, eu sempre tive medo de que meus filhos estivessem andando pelo Grove e meu cachorro corresse para dentro do Grove por medo, você sabe, dos carros que passavam.
 Você ouvirá um estrondo e coisas caindo de um caminhão quando ele parar na lombada.
 Então, todas essas coisas juntas, e então você tem um parque e mais pessoas estacionando, andando e visitando.
 Você sabe, a calçada é estreita.
 Sem dúvida.
 Se eu atravessar a rua naquela calçada, em frente à minha casa em Grove, naquela estrada de terra, parece, acho que tecnicamente pode parecer larga, mas não parece larga quando os carros passam por você.
 É muito, muito perigoso.
 Essa é a maior preocupação que tenho aí.
 E é uma rua movimentada, Newton e Grove.
 É um cruzamento muito movimentado.
 Ou os caminhões são novos e circulam entregando coisas.
 As pessoas viram lá o tempo todo, os motoristas do Uber viram aquela esquina.
 Concordo que é uma viagem local.
 Eu realmente acho que eles deveriam ter repensado essa entrada em grande estilo.
 Porque se eles repensassem e obtivessem muito mais informações, quero dizer, todos ficariam tão confusos quanto eu sobre essa entrada.
 E deveria ter sido bem, muito bem pensado.
 E deveria ter havido muito mais contribuições porque é uma coisa local.
 E eu digo gastar o dinheiro.
 O dinheiro gasto agora não é nada, apenas alguns centavos, comparado ao que poderia ser.
 Então, é claro, gaste o dinheiro.
 Gaste com sabedoria.
 Da última vez que verifiquei, não estava se movendo tão rápido.
 Então, quando você configura, é para sempre.
 E é histórico.
 É por isso que é muito importante fazê-lo corretamente.
 Então eu também sou diretamente afetado, como todo mundo.
 Todos nós estamos aqui há algum tempo.
 Todos nós investimos muito esforço em nossas casas aqui e adoramos isso aqui.
 É por isso que recomendo repensar aquela abertura perto da casa de John.
 John trabalha muito em casa e cuida bem de sua propriedade.
 Faça algo sobre o barulho.
 Quando você está no quintal, basicamente anos atrás, antes do COVID, tudo que você ouve é sempre ouvir um ônibus, um trem,
 um avião quando você está no seu quintal aqui.
 Portanto, qualquer coisa que você possa fazer para utilizar as árvores e arbustos como plantas seria fantástico.
 E quero dizer, é basicamente isso, mas a velocidade é como uma luva em Newton e Grove e esse é o elemento mais importante para mim.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6000.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Obrigado Bobby.
 Muito obrigado.
 E estou feliz por termos ouvido seu comentário.
 Muito obrigado.
 Elyse, você é a próxima.
 Nome e endereço para registro, por favor.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6009.428s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: Sim, Elyse Jennings, 94 Grove Street, em frente ao muro dos escravos.
 Obrigado por realizar esta reunião e por todas as informações.
 Concordo com muitas das coisas que foram ditas.
 Acordo pensando que houve um terremoto muitas noites desde que o trabalho foi concluído.
 Mas eu só queria levantar um ponto que ainda não havia surgido.
 Ah, e a propósito, sou dono de um cachorro e tenho um filho pequeno na Grove Street.
 Mas eu queria levantar a questão das faixas de pedestres.
 Bem, eu entendo a necessidade de acessibilidade e provavelmente ajudaria a desacelerar o tráfego.
 Eu só me preocupo com as monstruosidades de muitos sinais ou luzes piscando.
 Não sei como serão essas faixas de pedestres.
 Não sei de quantos realmente precisamos.
 Então, eu só queria levantar esse ponto porque ainda não tinha ouvido isso.
 E também quis fazer eco à divulgação de informação.
 Ouvi de um vizinho que sabe que moro aqui e me contou sobre isso e que tenho sorte de conhecer alguns dos vizinhos porque estou aqui há oito anos, mas temos alguns vizinhos mais novos com os quais eles ainda não estão tão conectados.
 Então seria ótimo se vocês pudessem obter mais facilmente a informação de que essas reuniões estão acontecendo e que esses planos estão sendo feitos.
 Depois, apenas um pequeno comentário sobre quando o muro dos escravos e todos os outros muros foram erguidos.
 Mais uma vez, falando sobre coisas desagradáveis, havia um porta-penico que estava bem na nossa frente.
 Os carros parariam e as pessoas usariam o penico.
 Ficou lá por meses após a conclusão do trabalho, ou pelo menos semanas após a conclusão do trabalho.
 Não sei se o próximo trabalho incluirá um penico, mas só por
 Para conectá-lo e talvez garantir que seja bem gerenciado, para que não precisemos ficar lá por mais tempo do que o trabalho.
 E sim, esses são apenas os comentários que eu queria fazer.
 Obrigado.
 Muito obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6140.425s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: Aliás, ali quem foi e grampeou as informações da reunião.
 postes, obrigado, foi assim que descobri, estava passeando com meu cachorro e alguém tinha grampeado a placa ali, então obrigado.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6162.239s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: Sim, também descobri por uma vizinha, na verdade pela Diane, infelizmente não da cidade.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6171.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Há algum outro comentário de alguém que você gostaria de fazer esta noite antes de concluirmos?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6176.912s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: Não, mas quero deixar claro que se as pessoas têm lugares onde vão para obter informações, seria melhor se quando nos enviarem um e-mail elas apenas nos dissessem, sabe, se você tem um lugar para ir, por exemplo, a gente tenta jogar na porta ao lado e.
 Uh, você sabe, e anos atrás existiam fóruns de bate-papo do Yahoo dos quais todos participavam.
 Mas, você sabe, se houver algo assim agora, ficaremos felizes em tentar aproveitar esses recursos para garantir que aproveitaremos todos os disponíveis.
 E Jen, talvez possamos tentar, você sabe, se avançarmos com o trabalho de design ou algo assim, se tivermos outra reunião, talvez você possa apresentar a lei tributária e, você sabe, isso afetará.
 Pelo menos a casa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6217.961s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: Sim, acho que conversei com Dennis sobre a conta da água.
 É simplesmente difícil.
 Como se você tivesse que acertar o e-mail.
 E você sabe, infelizmente, não temos realmente um orçamento, temos que trabalhar com a cidade para, você sabe, tentar fazer um mail-in.
 Então, mas nós ouvimos você e veremos o que podemos fazer e tentaremos fazer funcionar.
 E tente pegá-lo, você sabe, talvez façamos algumas jogadas de porta,
 você pode caminhar pelo bairro.
 Teremos algumas ideias e realmente apreciamos os comentários de todos esta noite.
 E, novamente, envie-nos um e-mail para a comissão se tiver alguma ideia após esta reunião.
 Isto não é, certamente não é o fim do processo.
 Este é o começo ou o meio e agradecemos feedback.
 Se você deseja estar em nossa mailing list, envie-nos o seu, se você nos enviar um email, garantiremos que você esteja em nossa lista.
 E estamos sempre abertos para receber comentários e sugestões.
 Então, obrigado como sempre.
 Obrigado a todos por terem vindo esta noite.
 Obrigado por ficar aqui por mais de 90 minutos e nos vemos na próxima vez.
 Muito obrigado.
 Tenha uma boa noite.</p>
