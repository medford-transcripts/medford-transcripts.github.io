    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=149.076s">[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  Thank you, Jen, for that introduction, and I think Ryan's going to get the.
 Presentation up on the screen.
 Great.
 Thanks, Ryan.
 So everybody should be looking at just the title slide here.
 My name is Peter Headland, a landscape architect and a planner based in Arlington right next door.
 I was fortunate enough to work on the master plan project and have now been doing a little study on this concept design.
 And we'll talk about that shortly here.
 Okay, next slide.
 Great.
 The 2020 master plan, we started in 2019.
 It was almost a year process.
 It went through 2020.
 And that's all on the historical commission website.
 And at the end of that, we came up with a series of phased implementation projects that could happen over a period of
 20 years, and we'll talk about the first phase of that with the next slide.
 So this shows the first, say, seven of these implementation ideas that came out of the master plan, restoring the wall, the historic wall right on the edge of Grove Street.
 an archaeological dig at the estate, which has also taken place.
 We'll talk about that a little bit.
 Making improvements to the Grove Street edge, the fieldstone wall there.
 Those were in phase one and we'll go over those in a little bit.
 Other projects
 from the master planning include new crosswalks, improvements to the trails, some type of signage to identify the park, and some planting in this central planted LA.
 Okay, on the next slide, we'll talk about that.
 The first step and really the reason for this whole park is what's now known as Pomp's Wall.
 In 2019, the image on the upper left, that was the condition when we began the master plan and we had a historic masonry consultant, Richard Irons, come and maybe some of you heard him talk.
 He gave a presentation a number of years ago.
 He evaluated the wall.
 I wrote up a pretty detailed technical memo about the wall and went over some options to restore the wall.
 Some of you might know that a wall that part of the, in the deed when this part was given to the city of Medford, it stipulated that this wall, they were so proud of this wall, that this wall needed to be forever maintained.
 The preservation and restoration of this wall is really important or else technically, the old estate could take this part back over, but luckily, that's not going to happen.
 The middle slide there shows the previous joint conditions, pretty deteriorated and the capstone needed some significant repair.
 So, in the next slide, we show the process in 2023.
 Mason was hired to do that work.
 This is that restoration.
 A lot of the wall really had to be taken apart and put back together.
 And maybe some of you.
 were there or witnessed some of that progress.
 And the brick on the right side is pretty interesting.
 The contractor pulled that out and you can see a fingerprints on the top of that brick.
 So that's
 Pretty interesting, the wall was said to have been built in 1760, and so those are over 250 years old.
 Were they from Pompeii, the former enslaved person who built the wall?
 Perhaps Medford was known for local brick making and these bricks were sourced locally, but that's really sort of a neat glimpse of history and all those bricks went back into that wall.
 On the next slide, you can see the final result from last year of the newly restored wall with newly pointed bricks.
 They ended up putting a new cap on top of it to really seal that with flashing.
 Hopefully, this will last for the next few generations.
 Okay, so the next project that came out of the master plan in phase 1 was improving the Grove Street edge, the old field stone wall.
 It's an interesting historic image on the right hand side of the screen here, which shows it's looking up Grove Street.
 That is the
 historic wall, formerly known as the slave wall, now known as Pompe's wall.
 And you can see the wall as it was historically, but over time, it had sort of fallen apart in some areas more than others.
 The image on the left here is showing prior to the master plan, you know, the
 wall in this area was pretty gone, and so the thought there was to improve this fieldstone wall.
 And so the next slide shows the results of that.
 With the wall repaired, it really helps to define the edge of the park.
 Also, cutouts were left at intersections for crosswalks to access the park.
 And...
 Another part of that project was for five feet behind that wall, clearing out the understory, a lot of invasive plants have popped up in there.
 Clearing that out a little bit, let these big trees, you can see this one over on the right side, give them a little bit more room to grow.
 Ryan, at the end, we'll talk a little bit about some upcoming planting maintenance improvements.
 Okay, on the next slide, we talk about the third part of this first phase of projects coming out of the master plan, the archaeological dig at the estate.
 Here we see illustration of the Thomas Brooks house that was right behind that wall.
 This later colored here, that's that wall, that's Pomp's Wall.
 You can see the drive right behind it and what this house looked like.
 It was built in 1727.
 The house was demolished in 1860.
 Then it just really sat there because it was never redeveloped and became a park.
 The archaeologists we brought on for the master plan were determined, and they were correct, that this is a highly sensitive area for archaeological findings.
 And the master plan proposed an archaeological dig
 with a professional and to work collaboratively with community volunteers, and that happened.
 And they thought that there was the possibility to find, very good possibility to find both pre-contact and post-contact artifacts.
 And on the next slide, we see that dig, which happened in 2022 and 23.
 Maybe some people on this call, this Zoom meeting were part of that.
 You can see some of the people from the community along with the professionals working on that dig.
 There were 23 test pits and over 1,600 post-contact artifacts and 64 pre-contact artifacts.
 And post-contact and pre-contact mean either pre-contact is pre-colonial settlement and post-contact is after settlers arrived.
 So there was both interesting findings from both of those areas, which is pretty neat.
 And here's some of the things that were found.
 That piece of pottery was on that site.
 Okay, next slide please Ryan.
 So there is a pretty detailed survey report from the master plan that made some recommendations.
 They recommended to protect and preserve this site, specifically this estate site area.
 They thought it was a highly sensitive area in and around the house site, and that in this area, that any below ground disturbance should be avoided or ideally kept at a real minimum.
 And that will come into play when we talk about the concept for this area.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan.
 We see where that area is.
 This is the approximate house location.
 We're looking south on the dirt path.
 You can kind of see the back of Pomp's wall there.
 So that's generally where that house was.
 On the next slide, we have a couple images looking both south on that site.
 Some low vinca has grown up there.
 Maybe,
 A remnant from ground cover that was planted originally that could be possible.
 And then this is looking north.
 It was a pretty open site originally around that estate, but trees have have grown in over time.
 Okay, and the next slide.
 We see a couple other just context views of the north entrance.
 This is the newly reconstructed wall and the break in the wall at the roadway opposite.
 This is looking south on the south approach and you can see the open lawn there.
 These are the two ways that visitors would get to this area.
 Next slide.
 Okay, so we've been working for the last number of months and through a couple meetings on a design concept for this central area for this historically sensitive area, and I'll walk you through the main.
 Concepts here, and with the 3 big ideas for the design concept to improve accessibility to the park.
 And help identify the park as such as as a park and to make some of this really interesting history visible.
 I remember when I first started working on the master plan, and I.
 was out exploring the park, it's definitely not evident that it is or was a town-owned property.
 And so the improvements to the walls certainly help.
 And some simple signage will help to identify it as an important historical park for the town of Medford.
 So the first concept is a history wall.
 which is a, these paths really sort of already exist, they're dirt pathways, mostly, and creating a loop here in this thicker orange line that would help to connect
 a number of these historically sensitive areas and use historic markers to interpret the history a little bit.
 And we'll go through each of those.
 But these blue circles are those 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 markers there.
 Also, two potential areas for welcome signs to the park.
 We'll talk about the
 interpretation and stabilization measures around the former estate site.
 And you have to be able to get to the park, so new crosswalks and accessible parking.
 Okay, the next slide, Ryan, we'll kind of walk through each of these.
 First is the history walk.
 The walk, again, in this thicker orange here, it would be an accessible path in terms of slope and surfacing.
 We haven't done a detailed, there hasn't been a detailed field survey done of this area of the park, but we think that it can be an accessible path below 5% slope.
 And we'd like to connect that to new crosswalks so people from this community, or maybe who are parking there could get into this park.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 There are 2 potential areas for welcome signs, and Ryan will talk a little bit more about this at the end.
 It would be great to identify the park, to name it, and to welcome visitors, to make them feel welcome.
 So here, opposite Jackson Road or potentially Ravine Road to the north are 2 potential areas for welcome signs.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 just a little bit history about Thomas Brooks Park.
 This is 1860 Brooks estate plan, which was pretty big.
 A lot of this land has since been given to the city of Medford.
 Our little sliver right there is Thomas Brooks Park.
 You can tell it's this almost like sharp triangle.
 Up on the upper right is
 at H.F.
 Walling Plan from 1855.
 And here we see our park there.
 It's easy to identify the railroad, which is this diagonal line, and then Grove Street.
 And so that sliver right there is what the future park looked like in 1855.
 It is adjacent to the Boston and Lowell Railroad.
 And then the six-acre park was conveyed to the city in 1924, again, with the stipulation that the
 brick wall, now known as Pomp's Wall, be forever maintained.
 On the next slide, we talk about these historic markers.
 Originally, in earlier iteration, this walk was just a linear path from here to here.
 But then as we took some feedback and evolved it a little bit, it's become more of a loop.
 Pomp's wall is right here just to orient everyone.
 It's great.
 And Grove Street is right here.
 So the proposal is to have a series of five simple historic markers so that visitors to the site would help to understand the rich history here a little bit better.
 Both the Native American history,
 which marker could be there, the African American history with this pretty remarkable wall, Pomp's Wall, that's just been restored.
 There's a pretty fascinating history of water systems and the Middlesex Canal here, and
 This is an appropriate place for that historic marker because it looks out over this lawn.
 We'll talk about that in a little bit.
 And then on the back of the park here, you're right next to the Boston and Lowell Railroad, now known as the MBTA Lowell Branch Railroad.
 which also has a rich history, and then coming around to the colonial American history of the site and the sort of remains of the Thomas Brooke estate and thinking about how to interpret and mark that.
 Okay, so over the next handful of slides, we move to the next one, we'll talk about how to do that and why that's important.
 So the Native American historic marker, again, with the archaic,
 I have a hard time saying that word today.
 With the dig that was just done, there were 64 pre-contact artifacts found collected during the 22-23 dig, which is pretty neat.
 Maybe some community members on this call or in this picture, I don't know.
 Largely, the items that were found were chipping debris and pottery shards.
 presumably from the middle to late Woodlands period, 2000 to 450 years ago.
 So pretty significant historical resource.
 And this has a potential for rich Native American history, given the proximity of water resources and the
 topography.
 So that's pretty invisible now, but it'd be great to make that history a little bit more visible, just with a simple interpretive marker.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we talk about Pomp's Wall.
 Okay, the existing marker, which is there, if you want to
 Sneak on the edge of the roadway and or peek at it from your car is shown on the upper right there.
 This upper left is a historic photo, which the date is unknown of, and the photo in the middle is from 1899.
 So you can look up Grove Street.
 You can see the wall, it's beginning to get overgrown there, but pretty open behind it, some of the big trees there.
 We know the wall was constructed around 1760, that the city is required to preserve and forever maintain it in that deed.
 to the city, it stipulates that.
 And then there was this recent, very important restoration and renaming of the wall.
 So that's an important history to help make visible.
 Okay, if we go to the next slide, we can help to mark in a way the importance of the Medford water systems.
 This picture on the left is a little hard to see.
 All these slides will be posted on the
 Historical Commission website.
 And if you look on there, there's a lot of information from the past number of years from all the studies and meetings that were done.
 This is a plaque elsewhere in Medford that shows the Middlesex Canal and the route.
 Our little park
 is right here.
 You can see the railroad and Grove Street.
 And so this Middlesex Canal was right to the south of this area.
 The Middlesex Canal was around from 1793 to 1853, ran from Charlestown to Lowell.
 It was partly financed by the Brooks family, which has such a prominent role.
 in the city of Medford.
 It supplied much of the lumber for shipbuilding in Medford.
 That was such a big industry in the city.
 On the lower right is an image of one of the bridges.
 There were a number of
 bridges, 50 bridges, all along the canal.
 And this was one in Medford that was taken down.
 But we think that some of these blocks were used in this Grove Street field stone wall, especially south of Pomp's Wall.
 You can go look and the stones there are more cut in.
 rectilinear blocks.
 I can't get into a lot of it here, but there's really a fascinating study that the head of the MWRA did on the role of Medford in the whole water and sewer development for the city of Boston in the nearby area.
 It's pretty fascinating.
 area where we're proposing this historic marker looking out on that field, well part of the reason the field is there and it's not overgrown is because there's a sewer easement that actually runs through there.
 And so there's a lot of interesting things to talk about for a potential historic marker talking about these water systems and the task will be how to distill this information in a concise way.
 Okay.
 If we go to the next slide, I talked a little bit about the Boston and Lowell Railroad and the proposals for historic marker on the backside of Thomas Brooks Park, talking about this, that this railroad was constructed in 1835.
 Also,
 partly financed by the Brooks family, the people didn't really want the railroad to happen, especially the people who were invested in the canal because the railroad made the canal not as necessary.
 And it essentially replaced the canal in order to speed up.
 Transportation provide year-round freight transportation because the canal would freeze in the winter.
 This railroad, it was the first major railroad in the state, one of the first in the whole Northeast, and it's still used today.
 It's an active rail line as the MBTA Lowell line.
 That's an image on the bottom right.
 You can see Boston and Lowell there.
 Okay, and Ryan, if you go to the next slide, the last historic marker kind of gets back to what we started with, with the dig on the site.
 Now, this is an image of the Brooks Estate House, and the historic marker would help to reinterpret that or interpret that history.
 that this house was built in 1727, you can see here there was a little curved driveway behind that brick wall.
 And that's essentially where, if you walk out there, where that dirt footpath is and where that history walk would be.
 Then you can see the brick wall between the street and the driveway, that's the palms wall.
 We know historically it was noted that there were three black walnut trees in front of the house.
 You can see them in this illustration and also those original trees aren't there.
 But if you're out there in that park, there are black walnut trees that are descendants, I think, of these original trees.
 Then as we know, there are a lot of artifacts recovered.
 from the dig over 1600 from the post-contact or colonial era.
 Okay, on the next slide, we looked at this site.
 This is the general area of that estate house, and the proposal is to both protect and preserve and interpret this site a little bit by marking the
 Corners of where the house was with simple stone blocks and stabilizing the surface with low plantings.
 And then this would be the blue circle that historic marker, which would be able to interpret it.
 So, if you go to the next slide.
 This was one of the site precedents that we looked at, Robbins Farm Park.
 It's a neat park right next door to Medford, up on the top of the hill.
 There's an old farm there.
 It was given to the city, turned into a park, and maybe probably 10 years or so ago,
 Park and Recreation Commission wanted to sort of memorialize the house in the former farm there.
 And so they put, they marked the foundation here with these stone blocks.
 These are kind of similar to what we're thinking for Thomas Brooks Park.
 And they had a simple sign in their case, it was right on the block.
 In our case, maybe it would be a separate standing element as a way to
 Talk about the former farmhouse that was there and give people a sense of that history a little bit.
 Okay, on the next slide we have another site that's interpreted the historic history, tracing the foundations of historic house.
 This is the Governor Winthrop House in Charleston, the great house site where they used found stones and some foundation stones and brought those to the surface and
 Trace that foundation there and then just a simple lawn is a very different setting their more urban area and more extensive historic sign that you can see on the bottom right.
 Okay, on the next slide.
 We also would like to stabilize the surface in a very simple way with ground cover planting.
 There's already a little bit of that there with a vinca that's taken over, naturalized the site a little bit.
 And on the next slide, we'd like to add to that a little bit with a nice native plant, gold star.
 It's native, shade-tolerant, a lot of trees around, pretty low, 6-12 inches tall, and has a nice bloom from the late spring into the fall.
 You can imagine walking on this path and coming across these blocks and a little burst of flowers might be a pretty elegant, beautiful, but yet subtle way to think about this site.
 On the next slide, we talked about another way that we could use plants to bring back the history.
 This is Syringa vulgaris, a common lilac, which is for hundreds of years been part of New England's horticultural heritage.
 And the quote on the bottom here is from the
 Medford paper in 1912, that some of the historic research which the state did, which predated the master plan, they pulled together, and I'll just read the quote, beside the street, Grove Street, and between the ends of the drive was this brick wall constructed and bordered with a row of lilacs.
 So they're talking about Palm's Wall and they're talking about Grove Street, which by the looks of this was originally bordered with lilac.
 So wouldn't it be neat, the upper right image is of the Arnold Arboretum on Lilac Sunday.
 Pro tip, that's a great place to go.
 Amazingly,
 blooms in the middle of May.
 We'd like to bring those lilacs back at the wall.
 On the next slide, we can see a picture of the wall.
 This is looking right up Grove Street and Palm's wall over on the right hand side with a field stone wall next to it.
 And on the next slide, just a little illustration of what some lilacs would look like right behind that wall.
 It would look pretty nice for vehicles or people on the sidewalk over on the other side here.
 It's a nice southern orientation there, southwest orientation.
 So I think those lilacs would do well.
 And at the same time, we could plant some, just a low ground cover on the roadside to help stabilize that embankment there.
 Okay, and on the next slide, we have a look at the existing conditions behind Pompe's wall and up that path so this would be the history walk and then the next slide shows a little illustration of
 what that might look like with some lilacs over on the side in this simple walkway that would then loop around with a series of historic markers and then the stone blocks at the estate house to give a deeper understanding of the rich history of this site.
 Okay, on the next slide, I believe we're hopping into some information Ryan from the historical commission can share on the upcoming improvements for the second phase at the park.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=1938.088s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 好吧，现在我只想快速深入了解第二阶段的构建更新。
 因此，重申一下 Jen 在开头所说的，我们有 2020 年总体规划，但该文件是一份动态文件，可能会发生变化。
 这将会发展。
 因此，无论总体规划中有什么内容，我相信你们中的一些人已经读过，我们使用的分期与施工中所需的分期不同。
 因此，对于这个资助阶段，完全得益于社区保护委员会的慷慨资助，我们打算进行更大规模的考古挖掘，我们打算根据《美国残疾人法案》的要求修剪一些树木并清除枯木，
 通往路边切口、人行道和停车位的建筑通道。
 我们试图通过标记和张贴一些标志来识别十字路口，然后，当然，我们试图将这个地方识别为公园。
 有几件事正在考虑中。
 当然，我们正在关注彼得刚才谈到的这个考古前沿，它正处于早期规划阶段。
 当然，我们正在考虑诸如改善步道清晰度、添加适合场地的树木以及在植树时进行一些灌木修剪和侵入式割草等措施。
 但当然，没有考虑到什么，我们很久以前在公众会议上就听说过，现在我们听到，即使在总体规划中，我们也没有以任何方式考虑社区花园或铁路桥。
 所以我要把这个放在一边，这样人们就知道我们正在考虑的是对公园影响较小的事情，好吗？
 因此，对于考古学，我们打算聘请一位考古学家来探索托马斯·布鲁克斯故居的遗址以及居住在那里的人们，包括布鲁克斯家族及其雇用的员工。
 这是一个鲜为人知的话题，但已被探索过。
 该遗址与新英格兰的奴隶制有很多联系，因此它是一个非常重要的地方。
 所以，在做出任何限制之前
 为了永久保护该遗址，我们希望完成对此事的考古尽职调查。
 我们将寻找社区志愿者，就像上次一样，我们可以让人帮助我们筛选土壤和对文物进行实验室工作，以便人们可以看到它们。
 所以我们一定会为此努力。
 我们考古部分的工作将是我们希望在两者之间设置的限制
 你知道，佩德罗的历史之旅以及对房子和解释面板的解释以及所有这些都是为了保护这个网站免受任何负面影响。
 有很多树木修剪工作要做。
 为此，我们正在研究与该地点 50 棵树龄约 150 年的树木相关的最直接问题。
 其中，保存状况较好的古树有30株。
 他们需要修剪，就像修剪灯一样，只是为了去除一些枯枝，一些领导者折断了，但有10
 公园内和周围的树木完全死了。
 您可以在右侧看到这张图片，其中他们的领导人完全分裂，什么都没有留下，为了公共安全，这些树必须被移除。
 在其他图像中，例如最左边的图像，您可以看到领导者已经分开并摇摇欲坠地悬挂在一些小路上。
 所以我们正在寻找
 将它们全部修剪，使婴儿围栏从一端到另一端都牢固。
 还有两棵入侵的挪威枫树已经完全死亡。
 它们高耸于这个地方。
 他们身高约20英尺，但只有15岁。
 我们希望将其移除，因为任何大小如此之大的树都会造成滋扰，并且会绕过 MBT​​A 的通行权。
 但随着树木的修剪，
 我们希望种植 15 棵新树。
 我说的是橡树，但与城市树木管理员交谈时，它可能是橡树，也可能是糖枫树，这些树原产于新英格兰，也原产于这个地方，我们希望取代这里的入侵性挪威枫树，我们有计划继续种植可以治愈的树木，可以这么说，以便公园成为一个公园并保持森林的感觉。
 现在，作为该项目的一部分，最重要的关键部分之一是我们希望清除整个场地中的所有死木。
 所以我们知道，当格罗夫街发生冰暴时，一些枯木被从街上移走。
 DPW 破坏了这一点。
 让我们完成这项工作吧。
 当然，出于公共安全原因，在隔离墙期间也砍伐了几棵树。
 所有这些都将被消除。
 然后，所有即将死亡或死去的历史树木的各种树便将从公园的一端移至另一端。
 所以这将是一次从上到下的彻底清洁。
 大部分此类材料如果太大，将会从网站上删除。
 如果再小一点的话
 它可以被压碎，我们会将其中一些放回到道路上，这样道路上就有了一些定义。
 为了改善无障碍环境，我们在整个公园内分布了多个设施。
 最重要的是，我们将重新连接格罗夫街东侧的人行道（目前终止于牛顿街）至杰克逊路的新入口。
 我们将在所有墙壁开口处切割人行道。
 Jackson Road、Gravine Road和Layard Road将设有条纹人行道。
 人行横道处将设有指示牌。
 当然，所有这一切都需要很长时间，因为有很多重要的参与者。
 所以我们正在探索和研究设计和概念，但是当我们开始推进这个项目时，城市的公共工程部门、交通部门都必须介入。
 所以我们才刚刚开始，还有很多很多个月的时间。
 但我们希望也许能在 2025 年春季开始施工，这样我们就可以基本上以正确的方式开始新的一年，并在冬季后的第一个可能的施工期间，我们将开始并交付我们已经工作了一年多的这些东西。
 为了获得空间，它们需要在附近的某个地方标记为无障碍路线和公园周围无障碍路径的一部分，即一个停车位。
 当我们最初制定总体规划时，我们被要求禁止汽车进入公园。
 因此，我们必须在某处提供 ADA 无障碍空间。
 我们将与居民以及你们所有人合作，尝试将其安置在一个对无障碍路线和居民都方便的位置。
 但它还要求该市与交通部门举行公开听证会。
 因此，将会有很多很多的机会来解决这个空间适合什么地方以及如何适合的问题。
 当然，
 想法改变了。
 有访问权。
 这并不可取，但如有必要，我们可以将停车位移回原位。
 对于人行道标记，我们希望保持简单。
 你知道，一条简单的油漆人行道就可以了。
 标牌尽量减少。
 前几天我们和交通部门谈过。
 也许人们更喜欢明亮的标志（如果有的话），那就是杰克逊路。
 那里有大量人群集中穿过公园的正门，这甚至可能是居民上下学的安全路线。
 但根据我们听到的反馈，这有待讨论。
 然后是公园标牌。有两种不同类型的公园标牌。
 有欢迎您参加历史之旅的标牌和解说标牌。
 但实际上，在这个阶段，我们试图将公园识别为公园。
 我们希望在同一条街上有类似布鲁克斯庄园标志的东西。
 该网站与
 归布鲁克斯庄园所有，但可能有自己的身份。
 所以我们还没有真正的设计，但我们确实有一些东西可以将其标识为具有一定历史的城市公园，以便每个人都知道它不仅仅是一片废弃的森林，它实际上是梅德福的一个重要场所。
 当然，通过持续的规划，我们正在考虑将一些事情作为该项目的一部分，这些事情将导致其他项目。
 我们有关于树木的历史工作。
 有一次，我们想打开一条种满橡树和黑胡桃木的小巷。
 或许可以减少一些入侵的挪威枫树。
 但我们正在倾听，我们了解到目前植被的作用就像一种声幕。
 因此，作为其中的一部分，我们会讨论种植一些树木，以便随着现有景观的缩小，更大、更合适的树木可以增加尺寸。
 并且这个声音缓冲区始终被维护。
 但同样，这是后期阶段，有很多很多很多淘汰。
 但最大的问题是，正在进行的一些树木修复工作将减轻对 MBTA 围栏的损坏。
 因此，我们将让 MBTA 与我们合作修复围栏，确保公园安全，最终确保没有人能够跨越铁道床。
 这就是我们第二阶段工作的核心。
 所以我们知道您有意见和问题。
 因此，我认为如果您想发表评论或对我们有任何疑问，我们很乐意回答。
 我们只是要求人们举手。
 当然，今晚没有必要发表所有评论。
 这并不是一切的结束。
 我们将尽力继续考古实地工作，这不是
 除了出于安全原因进行挖掘、封顶和一些树木工作之外，对公园有任何影响，但其余工作将在六个月内再次完成该项目，因此，如果您知道稍后会出现问题，并且如果您想花一些时间消化今晚听到的内容并将其放入其中，我们将接受评论并很高兴收到电子邮件
 当然，正如我在会议开始时所说，如果我们没有您的电子邮件，如果您不在我们的联系人列表中，请向我们发送电子邮件，我们将很乐意将您添加到我们的电子邮件和广告中。</p>

 고마워요 페드로.
 Ryan이 말했듯이 의견과 질문에 기꺼이 답변해 드리겠습니다.
 혹시 무슨 일 있으면 전화할게요.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2651.095s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 이것은 정확합니다.
 14 Newton Road, West Medford, Thomas Brook Park 남쪽.
 마지막으로, 이 지역의 역사와 독특함을 보존하기 위한 관심, 지역사회에 대한 관심, 노고, 헌신에 대해 모두에게 감사의 말씀을 전하고 싶습니다.
 나는 단지 당신에게 감사하고 싶습니다.
 분명히 프레젠테이션에는 많은 작업이 필요합니다.
 당신은 분명히 커뮤니티의 의견을 듣고 있으며 나는 당신이 하는 일을 정말 좋아하고 즐깁니다.
 귀하의 노력에 진심으로 감사드립니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2683.696s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 매우 감사합니다.
 데이브, 당신이 더 나은 것을 원한다면 내가 당신의 손을 볼 수 있습니다.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2691.141s">[SPEAKER_08]</a>: 제 질문은 이렇습니다. 그들은 무엇을 보고 있었나요?
 우리가 여기에 살기 오래 전에 일어났던 일은 우리 측벽이 아직 불완전한데도 공원 방문객들이 단지 공원을 건너고 있었다는 것입니다.
 여기 사시는 분들은 좀 답답하실 것 같아요.
 많은 사람들이 단순히 잔디밭과 보도를 깎습니다.
 나는 벽의 이 부분이 완성되지 않으면 고속도로로 향하는 우리 길 양쪽에 있는 사람들, 그 지역의 모든 사람들이 계속해서 우리 소유지와 Brooks의 소유지를 이런 식으로 건너게 될 것이라고 믿습니다.
 다른 목표로 모든 목표를 달성하는 사람은 더 적습니다.
 오, 당신은 홀의 배치와 모든 것을 알고 있습니다.
 그렇다면 누군가 우리 벽의 이 부분을 마무리하는 것에 대해 이야기하고 있는지 모르겠습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2766.663s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 그래서 제가 댓글을 달 수 있고 Ryan도 참여하고 싶어할 수도 있습니다.
 우리는 벽 반대편에서 많은 의견을 들었습니다.
 이것이 바로 말씀하신 이유로 이 장소가 폐쇄된 이유입니다. 사람들은 공원에 가기 위해 사유지를 건너갑니다.
 이에 따라 도로에서의 교통 가시성은 물론이고 지상고도 높아져 도로 횡단이 용이해진다.
 이제 우리는 좌우로 지그재그로 움직이는 것이 좋지 않다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 따라서 다음 단계에서는 도로 양쪽의 보도를 기존 개구부까지 확장하여 사람들이 한쪽에서 다른쪽으로 건너는 것을 방지할 것입니다.
 Dave, 그들은 또한 공원 지역에 가기 위해 길을 건너 집까지 걸어갈 필요도 없습니다.
 그래서 우리는 Grove Road 끝과 이 작은 거리에 있는 사람들의 좌절감을 이해하고 경청하며 도로에 있는 사람들이 길을 두 번 건너지 않아도 되도록 더 쉽게 만들기 위해 노력하고 있습니다.
 라이언, 부끄러워하지 말고 우리와 함께 하세요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=2841.618s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 네, 아시다시피 우리는 이 부두를 정말로 건설하고 싶습니다.
 우리는 보행 공간을 제공하기 위해 벽을 5피트 높이로 두려고 했습니다.
 곡선 벽 옆에 나무가 있을 거라는 걸 알고 있으니 사라질 거예요.
 속도 신호를 조정해야 할 것 같습니다.
 그런 다음 정문까지 즐겁고 친근한 산책이 있었습니다.
 분명히 보도에 몇 가지 표지판이 있습니다. 조명이 있는 표지판을 설치하면 밤이나 빛이 적을 때 이곳이 정문을 통과하는 보도이므로 사람들이 알 수 있도록 하면 공원이 더 깨끗해질 것입니다.
 이제 알잖아
 그럴 것 같지만 사람들에게 깨끗하고 잘 관리된 옵션을 제공하면 장기적으로 좋은 결과를 얻을 것입니다.
 공공 안전상의 이유로 공원 반대쪽 끝뿐만 아니라 그로브 스트리트 철교(Grove Street Rail Bridge)의 반대쪽 끝도 폐쇄했습니다.
 마을 사람들은 다른 사람들과 마찬가지로 다시 성벽을 올라갔지만 모든 것이 순조롭게 진행되는 것 같았습니다.
 그래서 우리는 이것이 시간이 지나면 일어날 것이라고 생각합니다.
 혼자서 해결해보세요.</p>

 ខ្ញុំជាអ្នករំលោភលើទ្រព្យសម្បត្តិរបស់អ្នកនៅក្នុងឧទ្យាន។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយអំពីអនាគតអ្នកកោះរបស់ Taylor និង Johnson ។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលយើងធ្វើនេះ។
 នៅក្នុងផែនការដើម ខ្ញុំមានអារម្មណ៍ថាច្រកចូលផ្លូវញូតុននឹងល្អ។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាហេតុអ្វីបានជាវាត្រូវបានដកចេញ ឬហេតុអ្វីបានជាវាមិនកើតឡើង ប៉ុន្តែយើងរស់នៅក្នុងតំបន់ Medford ដែលមិនងាយស្រួលចូលទៅកាន់កន្លែងបៃតង។
 កូន​របស់​យើង​ត្រូវ​ឆ្លង​កាត់​ផ្លូវ​ជា​ច្រើន​ដែល​ពោរពេញ​ដោយ​ការ​ភ័យ​ខ្លាច។
 ដើម្បីចាប់ផ្តើមរឿងកំប្លែង គាត់បាននិយាយថា ពួកយើងពិតជាបានឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវដែក ហើយបន្ទាប់មកបត់ស្តាំលើផ្លូវដើម្បីទៅដល់ឧទ្យានតូចមួយនេះ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងត្រូវឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវ លុះត្រាតែយើងអាចដើរទៅហាងលក់គ្រឿងទេស និងសួនច្បារ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងនឹងឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវ Grove ដូចជាផ្លូវហាយវេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​នោះ​ជា​ហេតុផល។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលខ្ញុំមិនចាំថា Ryan ប្រើភាសាអ្វី នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលមនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នាដើរក្នុងទិសដៅនោះ ហើយនោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលយើងមានការខកចិត្តជាខ្លាំង នៅពេលដែលផែនការនេះមិនទាន់បញ្ចប់។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា យើង​អាច​ធ្វើ​អ្វី​មួយ​នៅ​ទី​នោះ កាប់​ដើម​ឈើ​ខ្លះ ហើយ​ឲ្យ​មនុស្ស​ចូល​ទៅ​ក្នុង​ដី​របស់​លោក Dave ព្រោះ​ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​ថា​វា​មិន​មែន
 ជម្រើសជាច្រើនមិនសមស្របទេ ប៉ុន្តែជម្រើសគឺសម្រាប់ពួកគេក្នុងការរត់ក្នុងចរាចរណ៍ និងដើរលេងជាមួយកុមារ និងសត្វឆ្កែនៅក្នុងទីងងឹត និងក្នុងពន្លឺតិច។ ខ្ញុំសង្ស័យថាផ្លូវគឺធំទូលាយគ្រប់គ្រាន់ដើម្បីអនុលោមតាម ADA ។
 ខ្ញុំមិននឹកស្មានថាវាដូចនោះទេ។
 ពេលនេះពេញរន្ធ ពេញកញ្ចក់ពិតៗ
 សួនឧទ្យាននេះភាគច្រើនស្រស់ស្អាត ហើយខ្ញុំដឹងថាវានឹងអស្ចារ្យនៅពេលសាងសង់ ប៉ុន្តែនៅលើផ្លូវ Johnson Avenue យ៉ាងហោចណាស់សម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ វាជាការខកចិត្តដ៏ធំមួយ ហើយខ្ញុំដឹងថាមនុស្សផ្សេងទៀតនៅក្នុងតំបន់នេះគឺជាប់គាំងនៅលើផ្លូវល្បឿនលឿនជាមួយនឹងអ្នកបើកលឿន។
 ហើយយើងមិនអាចទៅដល់កន្លែងបៃតងដែលនៅជិតបំផុតនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​ទាយ​ថា​អ្វី​ដែល​ខ្ញុំ​កំពុង​និយាយ​គឺ​ប្រហែល​ជា​យើង​អាច​ពិចារណា​ការ​សាងសង់​ផ្លូវ​ញូវតុន។

 ឧទ្យានគឺស្អាត។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដឹងថាយើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីអ្វីទេ។
 យើងពិតជាមិនផ្តោតលើតំបន់នេះនៅក្នុងការបង្ហាញនេះទេ ប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើអ្នកក្រឡេកមើលឱ្យជិត ដីទំនេរនៅផ្លូវញូវតុនឥឡូវនេះត្រូវបានគ្របដណ្ដប់ដោយផ្សិតខ្ទឹម និងឬសខ្មៅស្ទើរតែទាំងស្រុង។
 នេះនឹងបន្តកាន់តែអាក្រក់ទៅៗ។

 ដូច្នេះតើមានអ្វីកើតឡើងនៅពេលដែលនរណាម្នាក់បោះបង់ចោល?
 បើ​ងាក​មក​ដល់​ផ្លូវ​ឆ្លង​វិញ​ម្ដង។

 គាត់មិនត្រូវការវាទេ។
 តើអ្នកអាចដើរបានទេ? តើអ្នកទាំងអស់គ្នាអាចដើរបានទេ? តើពួកគេទៅណា?
 អ្នក​កំពុង​និយាយ ហើយ​អ្នក​ផ្សេង​ទៀត​និយាយ​ថា​វា​ជា​កន្លែង​តែ​មួយ​គត់​សម្រាប់​កុមារ។
 Medford មានកន្លែងបៃតងច្រើនជាង។

 ត្រូវតែមានដី 100 ហិចតានៅខាងក្រោយ។
 អ្នកត្រូវឆ្លងកាត់ផ្លូវដើម្បីទៅដល់ទីធ្លាបៃតង។
 មនុស្សដែលរស់នៅក្នុង West Medford មានសំណាងណាស់។
 ជាលទ្ធផលពួកគេបំផ្លាញវាដោយធ្វើដូច្នេះ។
 ចូលហើយសម្អាតឧទ្យាន។
 ច្រកចូលរបស់ខ្ញុំ ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកមិនបញ្ចប់វា?
 អ្នក​សង់​ជញ្ជាំង សង់​ចិញ្ចើម​ផ្លូវ រើស​វា​ហើយ​បញ្ជូន​មនុស្ស​ទៅ​ថ្ងៃ​ស្អែក ដើម្បី​បញ្ចប់​ជញ្ជាំង។
 ហេតុអ្វីបានជាអ្នកមិនធ្វើវា?
 អ្នក​គិត​ថា​ប្រសិន​បើ​អ្នក​នៅ​ផ្សារ​ទំនើប 69 ហើយ​មាន​នរណា​ម្នាក់​បាន​បុក​រថយន្ត​របស់​អ្នក​ខណៈ​ពេល​ដែល​អ្នក​កំពុង​ដើរ​ចេញ​នោះ​អ្នក​នឹង​ឆ្កួត​។
 នៅម៉ោង 10 យប់មាននរណាម្នាក់កំពុងដើរឆ្កែរបស់ពួកគេ។
 វា​មិន​មែន​នៅ​ក្នុង​ផ្ទះ​របស់​អ្នក​ទេ ដូច្នេះ​វា​នឹង​មិន​រំខាន​អ្នក​ទេ។
 មាននរណាម្នាក់រស់នៅលើផ្លូវ Jackson, Tyler និង John ។
 គ្មាន​មនុស្ស​ទាំង​នេះ​ស្នាក់​នៅ​ទី​នោះ​ទេ ដរាប​ណា​ខ្ញុំ​ធ្វើ។
 ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ទៅ​ទី​នោះ​ហើយ​មិន​ដែល​មាន​បញ្ហា​ទេ។
 សង្កាត់ដ៏ស្រស់ស្អាត។
 ព្រៃ​នេះ​ស្អាត​ជាង​ឥឡូវ​ទៅ​ទៀត។
 អ្នកមិនបានការពារពួកគេប៉ុន្មានឆ្នាំមកនេះទេ។
 ម្តងម្កាល អ្នកកាត់ស្មៅ។
 ការបើកនេះ ច្រកចូលនេះគឺជាការបើកតូចមួយ។
 អ្វី​ដែល​កើត​ឡើង​គឺ​គេ​យក​ថ្ម​ធំ​ចេញ​ដើម្បី​ឲ្យ​គេ​ដាក់​ម៉ាស៊ីន​កាត់​ស្មៅ​នៅ​ទី​នោះ។
 នោះហើយជារបៀបដែលវាបានចាប់ផ្តើមទាំងអស់។
 ខ្ញុំបានកាន់កាប់ផ្ទះនេះតាំងពីឆ្នាំ 2003 ហើយបានរស់នៅ Johnson Avenue អស់រយៈពេល 30 ឆ្នាំ។
 ខ្ញុំទើបតែលក់ផ្ទះរបស់ខ្ញុំ ប៉ុន្តែនៅតែជាម្ចាស់ហាងលក់គ្រឿងទេសចំនួន 69 ។
 ខ្ញុំបានទាក់ទងរួចហើយ។
 នាយកដ្ឋានចរាចរណ៍កំពុងមក។
 ពួកគេមិនចង់បានបញ្ហាទេ។
 យើងមិនដែលមានបញ្ហាអ្វីនៅលើផ្លូវ Johnson Blvd ទេ។
 ផ្នែកមួយទៀតនៃ Johnson Avenue ដែលហាងលក់គ្រឿងទេសបានជួបត្រូវបានបំផ្លាញ។
 ពួកគេបានបំផ្លាញតំបន់នោះ។
 មិនដែលមានគ្រោះថ្នាក់អ្វីនៅទីនោះទេ។
 Juan សូម​អរគុណ​យ៉ាង​ខ្លាំង​ចំពោះ​ការ​បញ្ចេញ​មតិ​របស់​អ្នក​។</p>

 당신은 나에게 경고한 적이 없습니다.
 나는 유일한 이웃이다.
 나는 당신에게 경고하지 않을 것입니다.
 이웃으로부터 알림을 받았습니다.
 그들이 무엇을 하는지 아시나요?
 다른 사람의 가방을 훔칠 수 있습니다.

 “저는 56 Grove에 살기 때문에 그 동네에 살고 있습니다”라고 John은 말했습니다.
 그래서 나는 John이 살았던 곳과 가까운 공원 옆에 살았습니다.
 내 조카는 항상 거기서 놀아요.
 그는 10살이었습니다.
 그는 그것을 많이 사용했습니다.
 나는 또한 그곳에서 다른 아이들을 보았고 그가 착취당하고 있다는 것을 알았습니다.
 물론 사람들은 그곳에서도 개를 산책시키지만, 다른 것들도 있습니다.
 우선, 정말 감사드립니다.
 나는 이것이 큰 발전이라고 생각한다.
 이야기를 설명해주셔서 좋았어요.
 죽은 나무와 죽은 나무가 많아서 나는 항상 그것이 타버릴까봐 두려웠습니다.
 그래서 이것은 엄청난 개선입니다.
 나는 당신이 하는 모든 일을 사랑합니다.
 다만 조금 아쉬운 점은 원래 계획에는 회색 도크가 있을 거라고 말씀하신 줄 알았는데, 버린 것 같습니다.
 이것이 아직도 가능합니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3602.83s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 따라서 우리는 교통부와 높은 보도 건설에 대해 논의했으며 이는 저장 탱크 설치와 관련되어 비용이 증가합니다.
 아직 존재하지 않는 경우.
 대부분의 경우 근처에 보도가 없는 위치에 크로스오버를 설치하는 것이 좋습니다.
 따라서 우리는 기존 장벽에 중점을 둡니다.
 트래픽을 사용하여 더 많은 트래픽을 추가할 수 있습니다.
 우리는 또한 도시 전체의 속도 제한이 25km/h가 되지 않도록 공원 외곽에 안전 구역을 만드는 가능성에 대해서도 논의했습니다. 예를 들어 시속 20마일입니다.
 하지만 우리는 이 도로에서 사람들이 과속을 하고 시야가 문제가 되며 일부 사람들은 안전을 위해 속도를 늦추고 싶어한다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 우리는 이것이 특정 장소로 ​​가는 최단 경로라는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 나는 메드퍼드의 나머지 지역에서 직접 이곳으로 운전했지만, 사람들에게 속도를 줄여달라고 요청하는 것이 여행을 더 안전하게 만들 수도 있을 것입니다.
 어쩌면 마커와 함께 사용하는 것도 도움이 될 수 있습니다.
 조금 더 안전하게 만드세요.
 하지만 고가도로를 건설할 수 있다면 그렇게 할 것입니다.
 그러나 그렇지 않은 경우에는 반대 방향으로 진행하여 양쪽에서 경사로에 대한 접근을 제공할 것입니다.</p>

 저는 공원 맞은편, One House Inn, 11 Newton Street에 살고 있습니다.
 나는 여기서 말한 모든 사람의 의견에 적어도 어느 정도는 동의한다고 생각합니다. 이번 연설에 진심으로 감사드립니다.
 우리가 메드포드의 역사를 이토록 깊이 바라보고 고민하고 있다는 사실이 감동이고 자랑스럽습니다.
 그래서 고마워요.
 존처럼 나 역시 공동체 의식이 중요하다고 생각한다고 말할 수 있다.
 제가 귀하의 뉴스레터를 구독하지 않고 이 주제에 관심이 없었다면 오늘 회의에 대해 알지 못했을 것 같습니다.
 커뮤니티에는 결정이 내려지고 있다는 사실을 모르고 걱정하는 사람들이 많이 있다고 생각합니다.
 그래서 이것이 메시지인지는 모르겠습니다.
 존의 관점에서 이 커뮤니티를 보면 의사결정의 투명성이나 배려가 별로 없다고 생각합니다.
 오브라이언과 지역사회 구성원들은 적어도 회의에 아이디어를 가져오고 싶어한다고 생각합니다.</p>

 2주 전에 시에 일을 요청해서 911 전화를 받으신 분들, 그렇지 않다면 시 달력에 올려놓았을 텐데, 물어보셨나요?
 회신은 메시지를 전달하기 위한 것입니다. 우리는 귀하가 아는 사람이 누구인지 확인하고 싶습니다. 소셜 미디어에 게시하는 다른 방법이 있고 시에서는 이를 달력에 게시합니다. 하지만 모든 사람이 Facebook을 사용하는 것은 아니며 모든 사람이 소셜 미디어를 사용하는 것은 아닙니다. 따라서 우리는 John과 같은 사람, 자신이 좋아하는 메시지를 듣는 사람, 반응하는 사람이 있는지 확인하고 싶습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=3836.496s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 간단하게 설명하자면, 아직 도시 경보에 등록하지 않았고 해당 지역에 있는데 메시지를 받지 못했다면 귀하의 주소가 시스템에 없을 수도 있습니다.
 우리는 이것이 문제라고 생각합니다.
 이렇게 하려면 시 웹사이트의 경고로 이동하세요.
 휴대폰에서 맞춤 설정할 수 있고, 이메일을 통해 받을 수 있으며, SMS인 경우 종이 대신 인쇄본으로 휴대폰으로 배달되도록 할 수 있습니다.
 하지만 그곳에 주소가 없으면 번역된 메시지를 받을 수 없습니다.
 그래서 사람들이 그걸 알았으면 좋겠어요.</p>

 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែដឹងថាវាពិបាកក្នុងការផ្តោតលើការប្រជុំទាំងនេះ ហើយមានមនុស្សច្រើនណាស់ដែលយកចិត្តទុកដាក់ចំពោះសួនឧទ្យាននេះ នៅក្នុងសហគមន៍នេះ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា ពួក​គេ​នឹង​ដឹង​គុណ​ចំពោះ​ការ​យល់​ដឹង​បន្ថែម​ទៀត។

 ជាក់ស្តែងក្នុងនាមជាអ្នកដើរកាត់ញូវតុន ខ្ញុំពិតជានឹកវាណាស់។
 នេះធ្វើឱ្យចុងបញ្ចប់នៃឧទ្យាននេះស្ទើរតែជាទីបញ្ចប់។
 ចំណែក​ខាង​ត្បូង​មិន​គ្រាន់​តែ​ជា​ផ្លូវ​ចូល​ប៉ុណ្ណោះ​ទេ តែ​ក៏​ជា​កន្លែង​កម្សាន្ត​ដែរ។

 អ្នកដឹងទេ យើងចង់បានគាត់មកវិញ។
 យើងចង់ត្រលប់មកវិញដើម្បីបើកប្រវែងទាំងមូលនៃឧទ្យាន។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​ថា​នោះ​ជា​សារ​ស្រប​គ្នា​ខ្លាំង​សម្រាប់​មនុស្ស​ភាគ​ច្រើន​នៅ​ជុំវិញ​ទីនេះ

 ជាថ្មីម្តងទៀត ខ្ញុំគិតថាផែនការនេះល្អណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្វីដែលអ្នកបានធ្វើគឺអស្ចារ្យណាស់។
 ក្តីបារម្ភរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺតែងតែមានអំពីការថែទាំ និងស្ថានភាពនាពេលអនាគត។
 ការមានសួនកម្សាន្ត និងរូបថតស្អាតៗ គឺជារឿងមួយ ប៉ុន្តែដូចដែលយើងបានឃើញហើយ ប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនមានថវិកា ឬមិនគិតពីការរក្សាវាទេនោះ
 វាអាចអាក្រក់ក្នុងរយៈពេលដ៏ខ្លី។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលអ្នកកំពុងរៀបចំផែនការ សូមគិតអំពីវា ហើយមានធាតុនៅក្នុងថវិការបស់អ្នក ឬក្នុងចិត្តសម្រាប់របៀបរក្សាវាឱ្យមើលទៅល្អតាមដែលអាចធ្វើទៅបាននៅថ្ងៃនៃការអនុវត្ត។
 សូមអរគុណ។

 ខ្ញុំរស់នៅទល់មុខជញ្ជាំង។
 ប្រហែលបួនដងក្នុងមួយឆ្នាំ ខ្ញុំឃើញមនុស្សឈប់នៅផ្លូវ Grove ហើយដើរទៅអានផ្លាកសញ្ញា។
 តើអ្នកដឹងថាខ្ញុំមានន័យយ៉ាងណាទេ?
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំពិតជាពេញចិត្តចំពោះគំនិតនៃការកែលម្អ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកគ្រាន់តែត្រូវវិនិច្ឆ័យដោយខ្លួនឯងដើម្បីដឹងថាវាជាការស្មើឬអត់។
 ដល់សាធារណៈជន។
 តើអ្នកដឹងថាខ្ញុំមានន័យយ៉ាងណាទេ?
 ដូច្នេះហើយ អ្វី​ដែល​សំខាន់​បំផុត​នោះ​គឺ​ជា​យោបល់​របស់​អ្នក​ជុំវិញ​ខ្លួន​ទាំង​ផ្ទាល់ និង​អ្នក​ធ្វើ​ដំណើរ​ជុំវិញ​អ្នក។
 ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ន័យ​ថា ប្រសិន​បើ​មាន​សួន​ច្បារ​ជ័យ​ជម្នះ ហើយ​សួន​ច្បារ​ជ័យ​ជម្នះ​គឺ​មិន​អាច​ទៅ​រួច​ទេ។
 ជាការប្រសើរណាស់ ពីព្រោះយើងមានការសន្ទនាផ្ទៃក្នុង ដោយសារយើងមានបញ្ហាសត្វកណ្តុរពាសពេញផ្ទៃ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីៗគឺល្អ។
 ដូច្នេះ​វា​ដូច​គ្នា ប៉ុន្តែ​អ្នក​ដឹង​ទេ វាល​ស្រែ​ពិបាក​កាត់​ណាស់ ប្រហែល​ជា​ពីរ​ដង​ក្នុង​មួយ​ឆ្នាំ។
 សូម្បីតែពីអ្នកក៏ដោយ ក៏នៅតែមានគ្រួសជាច្រើនដែរ។
 ដូច្នេះថ្ងៃមួយ ខ្ញុំបានដកគល់កោណចេញពីសួនច្បារ ហើយដាក់វានៅសងខាងផ្លូវ សង្ឃឹមថានឹងមានអ្នកមកពីទីក្រុងមករកវានៅទីបំផុត។
 ព្រោះ​វា​នៅ​ទីនោះ​តាំង​ពី​ជញ្ជាំង​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​សាងសង់។
 មែនហើយ ខ្ញុំឃើញមានពេលមួយក្នុងដំណោះស្រាយមួយ ចុចលើ C ហើយមាននរណាម្នាក់ត្អូញត្អែរអំពីមនុស្សចោលសំរាមនៅទីនោះ។
 ទោះ​ជា​យ៉ាង​ណា ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា វា​បាន​ក្លាយ​ជា​ការ​ប្រកែក​ជាមួយ​អ្នក​ណា​ដែល​មក​ជួប​គាត់
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនធ្វើទេ ប្រសិនបើអ្នកចាប់ផ្តើមគម្រោង ហើយចាត់ទុកវាដូចជារឿងអាស្រូវ មនុស្សនឹងងាកមកគិត អូ វានៅតែឆ្កួត។
 ខ្ញុំអាចធ្វើអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំចង់បាន។
 ដូច្នេះ​ដំណាក់កាល​ដំបូង​នៃ​គម្រោង​នេះ​ហាក់​ដូច​ជា​ត្រូវ​បាន​ដាក់​ឱ្យ​ដំណើរការ ប៉ុន្តែ​មិន​ទាន់​បញ្ចប់​នៅឡើយ​ទេ ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេថា មានទង់ជាតិនៅជុំវិញឆ្មាំ ហើយវាគួរឱ្យខ្ពើមណាស់ដែលពួកគេបាននៅទីនោះ។
 ខ្ញុំធ្លាប់មានចិត្តសប្បុរសចំពោះអ្នក មុនពេលជញ្ជាំងចាប់ផ្តើមប្រាប់អ្នកពីការពិត។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាផែនការដែលអ្នកធ្វើនឹងក្លាយជាការពិត ហើយរលាយបាត់។
 ខ្ញុំសប្បាយចិត្តណាស់ អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថាវានៅតែនៅលើផ្លូវដើរនៅលើស្ពានក្នុងសួនឧទ្យាន ព្រោះមនុស្សត្រូវដើរនៅលើកំពូលម្តងទៀត។
 កុមារត្រូវដើរចូល និងជុំវិញផ្លូវ Grove។
 ខ្ញុំ​កំពុង​ប្រាប់ Mike របង​រលំ​ហើយ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ កូនប្រុសរបស់ខ្ញុំដើរកាត់ផ្លូវដែក ព្រោះវាស្ទើរតែមានសុវត្ថិភាពជាងការឡើងលើជ្រុង Grove ទៅមជ្ឈមណ្ឌលកម្សាន្ត។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ទាំងនេះគឺជាកង្វល់របស់ខ្ញុំ។
 មានពួកគេជាច្រើន។
 ខ្ញុំគួរតែធ្វើបញ្ជីមួយ ប៉ុន្តែវាអាចចំណាយពេល 30 នាទី។
 ប៉ុន្តែ ប្រាកដណាស់ វានឹងមានការចូលរួមពីអ្នកស្រុកកាន់តែច្រើន អ្នកដឹងទេ ព្រោះប្រសិនបើអ្នកមិនរស់នៅទីនេះ អ្នកនឹងមិនមកឧទ្យាននេះទេ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ នេះមិនមែនជាចំណតទេ។
 នេះមិនមែនជាអ្នកជិះសេះទេ។
 មិនមានរឿងបែបនេះទេ។
 នៅពេលនោះ។</p>

 ដូច្នេះ​មាន​រឿង​ខុស​គ្នា​មួយ​ចំនួន​ដែល​កំពុង​កើត​ឡើង​នៅ​ក្នុង​ការ​ពិភាក្សា​បញ្ចប់​នេះ។
 យើង​មិន​អាច​ដាក់​ផ្លូវ​ថ្មើរ​ជើង​នៅ​ទី​នោះ​ទេ ព្រោះ​មាន​ផ្លូវ​ថ្មើរ​ជើង​រួច​ហើយ។
 យើង​មិន​ចង់​ឲ្យ​អ្នក​ណា​ម្នាក់​ដើរ​តាម​ទ្វារ​ទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែក្រៅពីនោះ
 ដូចដែលខ្ញុំបានលើកឡើងពីមុន យើងចង់ប្រមូលផ្តុំចរាចរណ៍នៅចំនុចប្រសព្វសំខាន់នៃផ្លូវ Jackson ដូច្នេះត្រូវការចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ។
 ជញ្ជាំងទាំងមូលមានប្រវែងប្រាំហ្វីត។
 តាមពិតមានកន្លែងច្រើនជាងនេះ ប៉ុន្តែវាមានត្រឹមតែប្រាំហ្វីតប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ ADA ត្រូវតែមានទំហំ 48 អ៊ីងពីជញ្ជាំងដល់ផ្លូវកោង ហើយមាន 36 អ៊ីងនៃការបោសសំអាត។
 យើងមាននោះ។
 ប៉ុន្មានថ្ងៃមុនពួកយើង
 ឧទ្យាន។
 បើ​និយាយ​ពី​ការ​ចំណាយ យើង​នឹង​ពិនិត្យ​មើល​តម្លៃ​នៃ​ការ​បើក​ជញ្ជាំង​ឡើង​វិញ ឬ​ពង្រីក​ចិញ្ចើម​ផ្លូវ។
 ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវនៅផ្លូវ Jackson គឺថោកជាងប្រហែល $10,000។
 វានឹងត្រូវចំណាយ
 $36,000 យកអ្នកម៉ៅការត្រឡប់មកវិញ រើផ្ទះ បើកជញ្ជាំង រុះរើផ្លូវដើរ ដកជញ្ជាំង និងបើកចំហ។
 វាមានតម្លៃប្រហែល $20,000 ឬតិចជាងនេះ អាស្រ័យលើភាពពាក់ព័ន្ធរបស់វាទៅនឹងគម្រោងធំ ទីតាំងចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវ ទីតាំងផ្លូវកាត់ ទីតាំងផ្លូវបំបែក និងផ្លាកសញ្ញា។
 ដូច្នេះ យើង​គ្រាន់​តែ​ព្យាយាម​ថ្លឹងថ្លែង​ពី​គុណសម្បត្តិ និង​គុណវិបត្តិ​របស់​ទាំងពីរ។
 ត្រូវបើកចំហ និងធានាថាយើងទទួលខុសត្រូវផ្នែកហិរញ្ញវត្ថុសម្រាប់ប្រាក់ពន្ធដែលយើងទទួលបាន។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​ជា​ថ្មី​ម្តង​ទៀត នេះ​គឺ​ជា​ការ​ជជែក​ដេញ​ដោល។
 លោកម្ចាស់ នេះជាយោបល់។
 បន្ទាប់មក ចរាចរណ៍អាចនឹងនិយាយថា៖ ទេ កុំធ្វើបែបនោះ។
 ចូរយើងត្រលប់ទៅគំនិតនៃការសាងសង់ជញ្ជាំងចូរយើងធ្វើវា។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេ យើងក៏ត្រូវផ្តល់ឧបករណ៍ ADA ផងដែរ ដើម្បីធ្វើឱ្យប្រាកដថា ឧទ្យាននេះអាចចូលទៅដល់សាធារណៈជនបាន ពីព្រោះយើងទទួលបានមតិកែលម្អថាមនុស្សចង់ប្រើប្រាស់ឧទ្យាន ហើយយើងមានកាតព្វកិច្ចដើម្បីធ្វើដូច្នេះ។
 ជាផ្នែកមួយនៃការងារបឋម យើងចង់និយាយថា ប្រសិនបើយើងបើក និងបិទច្រកចូល ពួកគេទាំងអស់នឹងអាចចូលបាន។
 អ្នកដឹងទេថា អ្នករាល់គ្នាមានសិទ្ធិចូលទៅកាន់ឧទ្យាន ទោះបីជាមនុស្សនៅក្នុងផ្នែកផ្សេងទៀតនៃសហគមន៍មិនប្រើប្រាស់វាក៏ដោយ ក៏វានៅតែអាចប្រើប្រាស់បាន។
 មិនអីទេ
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា ការ​យល់​ស្រប​ទូទៅ​គឺ​ថា ទោះ​សាធារណជន​មិន​មក​មើល​ក៏​នៅ​តែ​អាច​មើល​បាន បើ​ចង់​បាន។
 អ្នកប្រាកដជាមិនអាចឱ្យនរណាម្នាក់ ឬនរណាម្នាក់ធ្វើបែបនោះទេ។
 ប៉ុន្តែអ្នកដឹងទេខ្ញុំ។

 ខ្ញុំមានយោបល់ខ្លះដើម្បីចែករំលែក។
 យើងនៅ 38 Jackson Street ។
 ដូច្នេះសូមអរគុណចំពោះការនិយាយរបស់អ្នក។
 អ្នកបានពិចារណាយ៉ាងច្បាស់នូវធាតុចូលសហគមន៍ជាច្រើននៅពេលរចនាបទបង្ហាញរបស់អ្នក ហើយបានចេញមកជាមួយនឹងការបកស្រាយជំនួសសម្រាប់ដំណាក់កាលទីពីរ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​សូម​អរគុណ​ចំពោះ​ការ​ស្តាប់​ដោយ​យកចិត្តទុកដាក់​ចំពោះ​សហគមន៍ ជាពិសេស​អ្នក​ដែល​ប្រើប្រាស់​សួនច្បារ​ជា​រៀងរាល់ថ្ងៃ​។
 សកម្មខ្លាំងណាស់ក្នុងការការពារ និងជួយសមាជិកនៃសហគមន៍នេះ។
 យោបល់របស់ខ្ញុំជាពិសេសទាក់ទងនឹងការធ្វើផែនការ និងការថែទាំដើមឈើសួន និងរបាំងការពារសំឡេង។
 ដូច្នេះស្វាមីខ្ញុំ និងខ្ញុំបានកត់សម្គាល់ក្នុងរយៈពេលបីឆ្នាំចុងក្រោយនេះ ដែលយើងរស់នៅទីនេះថា របាំងសំឡេងត្រូវបានវាយកម្ទេចចោលទាំងស្រុង ចាប់តាំងពីដំណាក់កាលដំបូងត្រូវបានបញ្ចប់។
 សំឡេងរថភ្លើងគឺ
 នេះកំប្លែងណាស់ ផ្ទះយើងញ័រ។
 វាហាក់ដូចជារាល់ថ្ងៃមានការរញ្ជួយដីតូចៗជាច្រើនដែលបណ្តាលមកពីដើមឈើរលំញ័រកំឡុងផ្នែកដំបូងនៃការជួសជុលជញ្ជាំង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំមានការព្រួយបារម្ភយ៉ាងខ្លាំងចំពោះដើមឈើផ្សេងទៀតដែលនឹងត្រូវកាប់នៅពេលក្រោយក្នុងគម្រោង ព្រោះទោះបីជាដើមឈើថ្មីខ្លះនឹងត្រូវដាំក៏ដោយ យើងសង្ឃឹមថាពេលវេលានឹងមិនស្របគ្នានោះទេ ព្រោះវានឹងត្រូវការពេលវេលាដើម្បីឱ្យដើមឈើទាំងនេះឈានដល់ការពេញវ័យ។
 ដើម​ឈើ​ដែល​គេ​កាប់​នោះ​មាន​អាយុ​២០​ទៅ​៣០​ឆ្នាំ​ហើយ។
 ដូច្នេះ វា​នឹង​ត្រូវ​ចំណាយ​ពេល​មួយ​រយៈ​មុន​ពេល​ពួកគេ​ក្លាយ​ជា​របាំង​សំឡេង​ដ៏​មាន​ប្រសិទ្ធភាព។
 ក្នុងពេលជាមួយគ្នានោះ សំឡេងរបស់រថភ្លើងគឺគួរឱ្យអស់សំណើចណាស់។
 រំញ័រ​គួរ​ឱ្យ​ភ័យខ្លាច​បាន​បំបែក​របាំង​សំឡេង។
 វា​អាច​នាំ​ឱ្យ​មាន​បញ្ហា​គ្រឹះ និង​ភាព​អវិជ្ជមាន​ខាង​ក្រៅ​ផ្សេង​ទៀត ដែល​អ្នក​ប្រហែល​ជា​មិន​បាន​ពិចារណា​ដំបូង​ឡើយ​នៅ​ពេល​រចនា​គម្រោង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាវិធានការផ្សេងទៀតគឺចាំបាច់។
 វិធានការនានាត្រូវបានធ្វើឡើងដើម្បីកាត់បន្ថយផលប៉ះពាល់នៃរបាំងសំឡេងដោយកាប់ដើមឈើផ្សេងទៀត ហើយដើមឈើណាដែលដាំត្រូវលូតលាស់យ៉ាងឆាប់រហ័សដើម្បីជំនួសរបាំងសំឡេង។
 កាន់តែឆាប់កាន់តែល្អ។
 សំណួរទីពីររបស់ខ្ញុំទាក់ទងនឹងការថែទាំរុក្ខជាតិទាំងនេះ។
 ជាពិសេស តើអ្នកណានឹងគ្រប់គ្រងគម្រោងទាំងនេះ?
 តើនោះជាសេវាកម្មព្រៃឈើ Medford មែនទេ?
 តើគាត់នឹងក្លាយជា arborist ផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនទេ?
 តើ​ពួក​គេ​ចំណាយ​ប្រាក់​ដើម្បី​ស្រោច​ទឹក​រុក្ខជាតិ​ថ្មី​ទាំង​នេះ​ហើយ​ធានា​ថា​វា​នៅ​រស់​ឬ?
 ដោយសារដើមឈើត្រូវបានដាំនៅ Medford ដំបូងបង្អស់ដើមឈើថ្មីចំណាយពេលយូរដើម្បីដាំដោយហេតុផលថាយើងមិនចូលថ្ងៃនេះហើយដើមឈើក៏មិនត្រូវបានគេយកចិត្តទុកដាក់ផងដែរព្រោះគ្មាននរណាម្នាក់ស្រោចទឹកពួកគេដោយសារតែខ្វះលុយ។
 ដូច្នេះ ដើមឈើដែលទើបនឹងដាំថ្មីត្រូវការការថែទាំជាប្រចាំយ៉ាងតិចបីឆ្នាំ ដើម្បីធានាបាននូវការរស់រានមានជីវិតរបស់វា។</p>

 មាន​ដី​នៅ​ខាង​មុខ​និង​ខាង​ក្រោយ​ជញ្ជាំង គ្មាន​ភាព​កខ្វក់​អ្វី​នៅ​ពី​ក្រោម​ឡើយ គ្រាន់​តែ​ថ្ម។
 ឆ្នាំនេះយើងពិតជាត្រូវបានមិត្តភក្តិរបស់យើងផ្តល់ផ្កាលីលី និងអំពូលផ្សេងៗគ្នា ហើយយើងកំពុងព្យាយាមដាំវានៅមូលដ្ឋានជញ្ជាំង អ្នកដឹងទេ នៅចំហៀង ប្រសិនបើអ្នកស្គាល់តំបន់នោះ មានដើមឈើមួយដូចបាល់តូចមួយនៅពីក្រោយជញ្ជាំងខាងឆ្វេង។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​រឿង​មួយ​ដែល​ត្រូវ​ចងចាំ​គឺ​ត្រូវ​ស្រោច​ទឹក​ឱ្យ​បាន​ច្រើន ព្រោះ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ប្រាកដ​ថា​តើ​មួយ​ណា​នឹង​រក្សា​ទុក។
 គ្រាប់ពូជរបស់ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំបានដាំគ្រាប់ពូជមានតម្លៃ 60 ដុល្លារក្នុងឆ្នាំនេះ និងគ្រាប់ពូជមានតម្លៃ 80 ដុល្លារកាលពីឆ្នាំមុន។
 ពួកយើងមានរឿងខ្លះដែលចំណាយពេលយូរ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំស្អប់ពាក្យនេះ ព្រោះមានមនុស្សមិនចូលចិត្ត ខ្ញុំមិនស្គាល់នរណាម្នាក់នៅទីនោះ ប៉ុន្តែជាមួយនឹងការប្រែប្រួលអាកាសធាតុ វាជារដូវរងាក្តៅ និងស្ងួតខ្លាំង។
 ប្រសិនបើអ្នករស់នៅទីនេះ អ្នកដឹងថាព្រះអាទិត្យមកពីណា។
 ពន្លឺព្រះអាទិត្យមិនត្រូវចាំងដោយផ្ទាល់ទៅលើតំបន់នោះទេ។
 បន្ទាប់មកស្ងួតខ្លាំង គ្មានជាតិកខ្វក់។
 មិនមានជាន់។
 ដោយផ្ទាល់នៅលើផ្នែកណាមួយនៃជញ្ជាំងនេះ។
 នៅពេលដែលអ្នកចូល ឬឆ្លងកាត់វា អ្នកនឹងឃើញដី និងស្មៅជាច្រើន។
 ប៉ុន្តែប្រសិនបើអ្នកចង់ធ្វើវត្ថុតុបតែងដូចជាផ្កាលីលី ឬរុក្ខជាតិផ្សេងទៀត នរណាម្នាក់ត្រូវតែថែរក្សាវា ជាពិសេសដាំវា។
 ដូច្នេះមិនមានទឹកដោយផ្ទាល់នៅទីនោះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំពិតជាគិតអំពីការសួរអ្នកជិតខាងរបស់ខ្ញុំថាតើខ្ញុំអាចប្រើប្រាស់ផ្ទះជ្រុងរបស់ពួកគេ និងស្រោចទឹកផ្ទះរបស់ពួកគេនៅតាមផ្លូវបានដែរឬទេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​វា​មិន​សម​ហេតុផល​ទេ​នៅ​ចំណុច​នេះ។
 ហើយស្មៅដុះនៅគ្រប់ទីកន្លែង។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា ការធ្លាក់មកម្តងក្នុងមួយឆ្នាំនៅក្នុងទីក្រុងនេះ ហើយស្មៅបំផ្លាញអ្វីៗទាំងអស់។
 ខ្ញុំ​ពិត​ជា​មាន​សួន​ដាំ​ដុះ​កាល​ពី​ឆ្នាំ​មុន ហើយ​បាន​កម្ចាត់​ស្មៅ​ទាំង​អស់។
 ដូច្នេះបាទ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនោះហើយជាវា។
 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បញ្ជាក់រឿងនេះ។
 បើ​អ្នក​ចង់​ធ្វើ​បែប​នេះ អ្នក​មាន​ថវិកា​សម្រាប់​អ្វី​ផ្សេង​ទៀត។</p>

 សួស្តីខែមិថុនា។
 ខ្ញុំ អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំពិតជាយល់ស្របជាមួយសមាជិកជាច្រើននៃសហគមន៍របស់យើង ហើយខ្ញុំលឺការខកចិត្តរបស់ John ហើយខ្ញុំលឺការខកចិត្តរបស់ Diane និង
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាគួរតែមានផ្លូវចូលនៅភាគខាងត្បូងនៃផ្លូវ Grove ដែលច្បាស់ណាស់ថាមិនជ្រៀតជ្រែកជាមួយសិទ្ធិផ្ទាល់ខ្លួន និងទ្រព្យសម្បត្តិផ្ទាល់ខ្លួនរបស់នរណាម្នាក់ឡើយ។
 ដូច្នេះ​ខ្ញុំ​អាច​ឮ​សំឡេង​ពួកគេ​ខ្លាំង​និង​ច្បាស់។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ចន ខ្ញុំដឹងថាអ្នកនៅទីនេះយូរហើយ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំក៏នៅទីនេះអស់រយៈពេលជាង 20 ឆ្នាំមកហើយ។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ខ្ញុំមិនមែនថ្មីសម្រាប់សហគមន៍នេះទេ វាលើសពីសួនឆ្កែទៅទៀត។
 យើង​បាន​ឃើញ​កុមារ​ជា​ច្រើន​ចូល​មក​ក្រៅ។
 ខ្ញុំស្រលាញ់សួនឧទ្យាននេះ។
 ខ្ញុំដឹងថាមាន អ្នកដឹងទេ
 ពួកយើងជាច្រើនខ្លាចការផ្លាស់ប្តូរ មែនទេ?
 នៅពេលយើងកាន់តែចាស់ យើងឈានទៅដល់ដំណាក់កាលមួយក្នុងជីវិតរបស់យើង ដែលយើងមិនចង់ឃើញការផ្លាស់ប្តូរខ្លាំងពេក។
 ប៉ុន្តែ​សម្រាប់​ខ្ញុំ ខ្ញុំ​ឃើញ​យើង​អង្គុយ​ក្នុង​សហគមន៍​ដែល​យើង​ពិត​ជា​អាច​ចូល​រួម​ក្នុង​រឿង​ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​មិន​ចង់​ជន់​លិច​សង្កាត់​របស់​យើង​ដោយ​មាន​ឡាន​សាលា និង​ហ្វូង​មនុស្ស ឬ​ជន់​លិច​ទីធ្លា​សាធារណៈ​ជា​ច្រើន​ដែរ។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលជាមួយគ្នានេះដែរ មានរឿងមួយនៅទីនេះ ដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាយើងគួរដឹងគុណ។
 ដូច្នេះការគិតរបស់ខ្ញុំគឺអ្នកដឹងទេ ចូរយើងធ្វើវាដោយគិតគូរ គិតគូរពីសហគមន៍ ដែលខ្ញុំគិតថាអ្នកគ្រប់គ្នាកំពុងធ្វើ ជាជាងការព្យាយាមនាំមកនូវចរាចរណ៍ដែលមិនចាំបាច់ច្រើន។
 ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលជាមួយគ្នានេះគឺជាតំបន់ដែលអាចមានប្រយោជន៍សម្រាប់:
 អ្នកដឹងទេថា ក្មេងៗនៅសាលា Brooks ចូលចិត្តដើរតាមផ្លូវនៅថ្ងៃនិទាឃរដូវ ហើយទៅដើរលេងដើម្បីស្វែងយល់បន្ថែមបន្តិចអំពីប្រវត្តិសាស្រ្តនៃតំបន់នោះ ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាវាមានសារៈសំខាន់ខ្លាំងណាស់សម្រាប់ពួកគេ។
 ខ្ញុំ​ក៏​ដូច​ជា​អ្នក​ដទៃ​ទៀត​ដែរ ប្រហែល​ជា​ក្នុង​សន្និសីទ​នេះ មិន​ចង់​ឲ្យ​ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ​ត្រូវ​បាន​គេ​បំភ្លេច​ចោល​ឡើយ។
 ខ្ញុំសង្ឃឹមថារឿងនេះត្រូវបានកោតសរសើរ ហើយខ្ញុំគិតថាមានអ្វីគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ខ្លាំងណាស់អំពីការសាងសង់ និងការប្រើប្រាស់កប៉ាល់នេះ។
 ប៉ុស្តិ៍ និង​ការ​ចូលចិត្ត​អាច​មាន​តម្លៃ​ពិត។
 នោះហើយជាអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំត្រូវនិយាយ ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំសូមកោតសរសើរចំពោះការយកចិត្តទុកដាក់ និងការពិចារណាដែលបានដាក់ចូលទៅក្នុងរឿងទាំងអស់នេះ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំមិនខ្វល់ច្រើនអំពីការផ្លាស់ប្តូរនោះទេ ដរាបណាវាឆ្លុះបញ្ចាំងពីការយល់ដឹងរបស់សហគមន៍ និងមនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នាថា មានផ្នែកពិតនៃរឿងនៅទីនេះ ដែលអាចប្រាប់ និងស្វែងយល់ដោយសុវត្ថិភាព និងសុភាពរាបសារ។
 ខ្ញុំ​សរសើរ​អ្នក​រាល់​គ្នា​ដែល​ធ្វើ​អ្វី​ដែល​គេ​ធ្វើ។</p>

 정말 감사합니다.
 다음.
 다른 사람들처럼 나도 이곳에서 약 30년 동안 살았습니다.
 나는 당신이 이웃이나 이 지역 사회의 사람들과 이야기하지 않고 이 전체 프로젝트를 추진할 것이라고 생각하기 때문에 조금 걱정됩니다.
 나는 또한 녹색 지역을 좋아합니다.
 나는 미스틱 레이크를 좋아한다.
 나는 거기 있는 작은 정원을 좋아해요.
 저는 이러한 변화가 마음에 들지 않지만 놀이공원이 특별한 도움이 필요하거나 휠체어를 사용하는 사람들이 더 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 노력하고 있다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.
 ADA를 어디에 주차할지, 제안된 진입로에 어떤 차량을 주차해야 할지에 대해 아무도 생각하지 않습니다.
 평면도를 보니 지금까지 도로 양쪽에 주차장이 두 군데나 보입니다.
 ADA 차량을 거리에 주차하는 방법과 휠체어 ​​접근을 제공하는 방법을 설명해 줄 수 있는 사람이 있습니까?
 이 프로젝트 이전에 ADA 포장의 발전에 대해 생각해 본 사람이 있었나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5452.147s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 그래서 우리의 다음 단계는 기존 레이아웃을 사용하고 DPW 엔지니어 및 기획 부서와 협력하여 문제의 세부 사항을 파악하는 것이었습니다.
 그것이 어떻게 작동하는지, 아니면 작동하지 않는지 아시나요?
 트럭이나 ADA 차량을 거리나 혼잡한 지역에 주차하고 싶으신가요?
 그래서 당신의 남편이 이러한 세부 사항을 경찰에 제출했습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5489.141s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 우리는 이러한 모든 대화, 모든 구역 규정 및 내부 변경 사항을 논의했지만 여전히 이 공원에서 장애인의 접근성 수준을 이해하지 못하고 있습니다.
 그래서 우리는 공원에 자동차를 주차하는 것을 금지함으로써 모든 것을 바꿨습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5507.249s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 지역사회에서는 공원에 차를 주차하지 말라고 요청했지만, 물론... 길 반대편에 주차할 수는 없습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5512.773s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 너비는 96인치가 필요합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5514.875s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 정확히.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5515.315s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 한 가지 확실한 점은 픽업트럭을 인도에 주차할 수 없다는 것입니다.
 주민들을 위한 길입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5525.148s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 글쎄요, 그것을 살펴보려면 엔지니어가 필요하기 때문에 잘 모르겠습니다. 하지만 설계에 대한 자금이 확보되면 다음 프로세스의 일부입니다.
 최소한 이러한 문제에 대한 실질적인 답변을 커뮤니티에 제시할 준비를 하십시오.
 아시다시피 그것은 사실입니다.
 이 기간의 시작이 맞죠?
 당연히 다른 것은 건드리지 않고 나무와 기념물의 안전 문제를 해결하는 데 중점을 둘 것입니다.
 아시다시피 저는 가장 논란이 많은 주제에 대해 이야기하지 않을 것입니다. 그렇죠?
 그래서 우리는 이러한 논란의 여지가 있는 주제를 가지고 있습니다.
 입찰이나 건설이 시작되기 최소 6개월 전이죠.
 그럼 우리는 빨리 움직이고 싶은 거겠죠?
 그런 다음 해당 디자인이 완성되면 커뮤니티에 보내 피드백을 받을 수 있습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5580.401s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 그럼... 먼저 이 이야기를 마치겠습니다.
 이 디자인이 작동하지 않으면 어떻게 되나요?
 우리는 완료되지 않은 프로젝트에 3년 이상의 팀 자금을 낭비합니다.
 그렇다면 앞으로 나아가는 데 시간과 에너지를 투자하기 전에 어떤 일이 일어날 수 있습니까?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5595.956s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 그래서 문제는 그것이 효과가 있느냐 없느냐이다.
 뭔가를 작동하게 만드는 문제입니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5601.962s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: 그래서 나는 이곳에서 30년 동안 살았습니다.
 이 거리에 주차장이 보이더군요.
 나는 보았다
 경찰은 속도를 줄이려고 했고 도로는 고속도로와 비슷해지기 시작했습니다.
 나는 이 길을 하루에 15번씩 직장을 오가며 걷고, 아이들을 데리고 출근한 다음 기차를 탑니다.
 이 길은 고속도로입니다.
 이 속도 부스터에는 속도 제어 기능이 없습니다.
 응, 알. 나한테는 그게 꽤 안 좋은 것 같아. BT도 나한테는 안 맞는 것 같다.
 누군가가 죽을 것입니다.
 다들 그렇게 생각하지 않는 것 같아요.
 다 끝났어.
 따라서 더 나아가기 전에 이 프로젝트에 필요한 것보다 더 많은 세금을 지출하기 전에 신중하게 생각하고 싶습니다.
 나는 그것이 도움이 된다는 것을 안다.
 나는 그것이 어떤 것인지 압니다.
 나는 시가 간병인으로 인해 어려움을 겪고 있다는 것을 알고 있습니다.
 우리 예산에는 이 부동산에 대한 계획된 수리가 포함되지 않습니다.
 나는 그 여자들이 나무에 관해 말한 것에 동의합니다.
 집집마다 나무가 쓰러졌습니다.
 집집마다 썩은 나무가 있다.
 이것은 버려진 나라입니다.
 특히 장애 조항을 추진하고 계신 것 같아요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5683.977s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 고마워요 빌.
 귀하의 의견에 진심으로 감사드립니다.
 우리는 확실히 그것을 조사할 것입니다.
 그럼 탈퇴를 원하시면 다시 BNIC로 연락주시기 바랍니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5697.584s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: 그럼 나는 어떻게 지내나요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=5703.545s">[SPEAKER_15]</a>: បាទ ខ្ញុំជា Bobby Nicotero មកពី 3 Newton Street ហើយខ្ញុំបាននៅទីនេះយូរហើយ។
 ម៉ោង​ប្រហែល​មួយ​ទៀប​ភ្លឺ ផ្ទះ​នៅ​លើ​កប៉ាល់​ញ័រ។
 ពីរបីយប់ ហើយបន្ទាប់មក ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា អ្វីគ្រប់យ៉ាងដែលមនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នាបានប៉ះពាល់នៅទីនេះ ខ្ញុំសុំទោស ខ្ញុំបានជួបប្រទះវាដោយផ្ទាល់ ឬដោយប្រយោល ខ្ញុំត្រូវតែនិយាយថា នៅពេលដែលយើងផ្លាស់មកទីនេះក្នុងឆ្នាំ 93 ប្រពន្ធរបស់ខ្ញុំបានធ្វើការបញ្ចេញមតិគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍មួយ។
 គាត់បាននិយាយថា Bob ខ្ញុំធំឡើងនៅ Medford បានទៅវិទ្យាល័យ Medford ។
 ខ្ញុំ​គិត​ថា​ខ្ញុំ​ដឹង​ទាំង​អស់​អំពី​វិធី​នេះ ប៉ុន្តែ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​បាន​សូម្បី​តែ​ដឹង​អំពី Rose Street ហើយ​ខ្ញុំ​មិន​ដែល​មក​ទីនេះ​ពី​មុន​មក​។
 អ្នក​មិន​អាច​ត្រូវ​ជាង​នេះ​ទេ។
 នេះ​គឺ​ជា​ស្ថានភាព​ដែល​មាន​មូលដ្ឋាន​ក្នុង​មូលដ្ឋាន​ខ្លាំង​ណាស់។
 យើងមានភាពរសើបខ្លាំងអំពីវា ព្រោះយើងរស់នៅជាមួយគ្នា ហើយខ្ញុំស្និទ្ធស្នាលណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំ​បាន​ឃើញ​អ្វី​គ្រប់​យ៉ាង​ដែល​អ្នក​រាល់​គ្នា​បាន​លើក​ឡើង។
 និយាយតាមត្រង់ទៅ វាពិតជាគួរឱ្យអាម៉ាស់ណាស់ ប្រសិនបើវាផ្លាស់ប្តូរ ព្រោះនោះជាអ្វីដែលឧទ្យាននេះ និងសហគមន៍នេះផ្តល់សម្រាប់ប្រជាជនដែលរស់នៅទីនេះ។
 មនុស្សចូលចិត្តវានៅទីនេះ។
 មនុស្សគ្រប់គ្នាធ្វើវា។
 នេះគឺជាសហគមន៍ដ៏អស្ចារ្យ។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាដំបូង ចនមិនអាចត្រូវជាងនេះទេ។
 ខ្ញុំត្រូវការអ្នកជិតខាងពីរនាក់ប្រាប់ខ្ញុំអំពីការប្រជុំនៅយប់នេះ ដូច្នេះពួកគេមិនបានព្រមានខ្ញុំដោយហេតុផលមួយចំនួន។
 ខ្ញុំមិនបន្ទោសនរណាម្នាក់ទេ។
 នោះហើយជាវា។
 វាជាឆ្នាំ 2024 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំដឹងថានេះយ៉ាងហោចណាស់គួរតែទៅ Grovers ហើយវាប្រសើរជាង។
 ប៉ុន្តែជាថ្មីម្តងទៀតនេះគឺជាឧទ្យានក្នុងស្រុក។
 ខ្ញុំសូមណែនាំរឿងនេះយ៉ាងខ្លាំង។
 ខ្ញុំមិនដែលដឹងអំពីឧទ្យាន Sagamore ទេ លុះត្រាតែកូនៗរបស់ខ្ញុំ និងមិត្តភ័ក្តិរបស់ពួកគេដើរតាមផ្លូវ ហើយបានរកឃើញថាមានជនជាតិអាមេរិកដើមនៅក្នុងផ្នែកនៃប្រទេសនោះ។
 រឿងនេះគួរឱ្យចាប់អារម្មណ៍ណាស់ ហើយយើងចូលចិត្តវាណាស់។
 ប៉ុន្តែមានភាពទាក់ទាញ និងស្រលាញ់ប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រជុំវិញវា។
 មនុស្សឆ្លើយតបយ៉ាងល្អចំពោះអ្វីៗ។
 ប៉ុន្តែខ្ញុំត្រូវតែនិយាយថា ផ្លូវ Grove គឺដូចជា gauntlet ល្បឿន។
 រថយន្តហាក់ដូចជាបង្កើនល្បឿនឬហ្វ្រាំងភ្លាមៗ។
 ជាអកុសល ថ្មីៗនេះ សត្វឆ្កែមួយក្បាលត្រូវបានរថយន្តបុក និងសម្លាប់នៅ Grove។
 នេះ​ជា​ការ​សោក​ស្តាយ​ខ្លាំង​ណាស់។
 បន្ទាប់មកគាត់បានត្រលប់ទៅផ្ទះវិញ។
 ហើយអ្នកដឹងទេថាខ្ញុំតែងតែព្រួយបារម្ភថាកូនរបស់ខ្ញុំនឹងទៅដើរលេងក្នុងព្រៃ ហើយឆ្កែរបស់ខ្ញុំនឹងរត់ក្នុងព្រៃព្រោះពួកគេខ្លាចរថយន្តឆ្លងកាត់។
 នៅពេលដែលរថយន្តនោះចតក្នុងល្បឿនលឿន អ្នកនឹងឮសំឡេងរដិបរដុប និងសំឡេងរបស់វត្ថុធ្លាក់មកលើរថយន្ត។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីៗទាំងអស់នេះបន្ថែមពីលើ ហើយបន្ទាប់មកអ្នកមានសួនឧទ្យានដែលមានមនុស្សច្រើនចត ដើរ និងទស្សនា។
 អ្នកដឹងទេ ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវតូចចង្អៀតណាស់។
 គ្មានការសង្ស័យទៀតទេ
 ប្រសិនបើខ្ញុំឆ្លងកាត់ចិញ្ចើមផ្លូវនេះ ទល់មុខផ្ទះរបស់ខ្ញុំនៅ Grove នៅលើផ្លូវដីហុយនេះ ខ្ញុំគិតថាតាមបច្ចេកទេសវាអាចមើលទៅធំទូលាយ ប៉ុន្តែនៅពេលដែលឡានឆ្លងកាត់អ្នក វាមិនធំទូលាយទេ។
 នេះពិតជាគ្រោះថ្នាក់ខ្លាំងណាស់។
 នេះជាកង្វល់ធំបំផុតរបស់ខ្ញុំ។
 វាជាផ្លូវដ៏មមាញឹក ផ្លូវញូតុន និងផ្លូវ Grove។
 នេះជាផ្លូវបំបែកដ៏មមាញឹក។
 ឬ​ឡាន​ថ្មី​ហើយ​ត្រៀម​ដឹក​ឥវ៉ាន់​ជុំវិញ។
 មនុស្សបើកនៅទីនោះគ្រប់ពេល ហើយអ្នកបើកបរ Uber ក៏បត់ជ្រុងនោះផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ស្របថានេះជាដំណើរកំសាន្តក្នុងស្រុក។
 ខ្ញុំ​ពិត​ជា​គិត​ថា​ពួក​គេ​គួរ​តែ​ពិចារណា​ឡើង​វិញ​ផ្នែក​នេះ​យ៉ាង​ហ្មត់ចត់។
 ព្រោះ​បើ​គេ​គិត​ម្ដង​ទៀត ហើយ​រៀន​ថែម​ទៀត នោះ​ខ្ញុំ​មាន​ន័យ​ថា អ្នក​រាល់​គ្នា​នឹង​យល់​ច្រឡំ​នឹង​អត្ថបទ​នេះ​ដូច​ខ្ញុំ។
 នេះគួរតែត្រូវបានគិតដោយប្រុងប្រយ័ត្ន។
 ត្រូវការការរួមចំណែកបន្ថែមទៀត ពីព្រោះនេះជាកិច្ចការក្នុងស្រុក។
 ខ្ញុំនិយាយថាចំណាយលុយ។
 លុយ​ដែល​ចំណាយ​ពេល​នេះ​គឺ​គ្មាន​អ្វី​ប្រៀប​ធៀប​នឹង​អ្វី​ដែល​អាច​ចំណាយ​បាន​ទេ គ្រាន់​តែ​កាក់​ប៉ុណ្ណោះ។
 បន្ទាប់មកពិតណាស់មានលុយ។
 ចំណាយលុយរបស់អ្នកដោយប្រាជ្ញា។
 លើកមុនខ្ញុំពិនិត្យវាមិនលឿនទេ។
 ដូច្នេះនៅពេលដែលអ្នកដំឡើងវា វានឹងដំណើរការជារៀងរហូត។
 នេះគឺជាប្រវត្តិសាស្ត្រ។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលវាមានសារៈសំខាន់ក្នុងការធ្វើវាឱ្យត្រឹមត្រូវ។
 ដូច្នេះ ខ្ញុំ​ត្រូវ​បាន​ប៉ះពាល់​ផ្ទាល់​ដូច​អ្នក​ដទៃ​ដែរ។
 យើងទាំងអស់គ្នាបាននៅជាមួយវាមួយរយៈ។
 យើងទាំងអស់គ្នាបានខិតខំប្រឹងប្រែងយ៉ាងខ្លាំងនៅក្នុងផ្ទះរបស់យើងនៅទីនេះ ហើយយើងស្រឡាញ់វានៅទីនេះ។
 នោះហើយជាមូលហេតុដែលខ្ញុំណែនាំអ្នកឱ្យពិចារណាឡើងវិញអំពីការបើកការិយាល័យនៅជិតផ្ទះរបស់លោក John ។
 John ធ្វើ​ការ​ជា​ច្រើន​នៅ​ជុំវិញ​ផ្ទះ និង​មើល​ថែ​ទ្រព្យ​សម្បត្តិ​របស់​គាត់។
 ធ្វើអ្វីមួយអំពីសំលេងរំខាន។
 នៅពេលដែលអ្នកនៅក្នុងទីធ្លាខាងក្រោយរបស់អ្នក ជាទូទៅកាលពីប៉ុន្មានឆ្នាំមុន មុនពេលកូវីដ អ្វីដែលអ្នកបានឮគឺឡានក្រុង រថភ្លើង។
 មានយន្តហោះមួយនៅពេលអ្នកនៅក្នុងទីធ្លារបស់អ្នក។
 ដូច្នេះអ្វីៗដែលប្រើដើមឈើ និងគុម្ពោតជារុក្ខជាតិគឺអស្ចារ្យណាស់។
 ខ្ញុំចង់និយាយថា នោះជាមូលដ្ឋានវា ប៉ុន្តែល្បឿនដូចជាស្រោមដៃរបស់ Newton និង Grove គឺជាកត្តាសំខាន់បំផុតសម្រាប់ខ្ញុំ។</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6000.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 감사합니다 바비.
 매우 감사합니다.
 나는 당신의 의견을 듣고 싶습니다.
 매우 감사합니다.
 앨리스, 다음은 당신이에요

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6009.428s">[SPEAKER_10]</a>: 예, Elise Jennings Street, 94 Grove, Slave Wall 앞입니다.
 이 회의를 조직하고 모든 정보를 제공해 주셔서 감사합니다.
 나는 이것에 동의합니다.
 일을 마친 후 며칠 밤, 나는 지진이 났다고 생각하면서 잠에서 깨어나곤 했습니다.
 하지만 아직 명확하게 밝혀지지 않은 점을 말씀드리고 싶습니다.
 아, 그로브 로드에는 개와 아들이 있어요.
 하지만 저는 보도 문제를 제기하고 싶습니다.
 글쎄요, 저는 액세스의 필요성을 이해하고 있으며 이는 트래픽을 줄이는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.
 내 유일한 관심사는 로고나 플래시가 너무 많은 몬스터입니다.
 이번 에피소드는 어떻게 될지 모르겠네요.
 우리에게 실제로 얼마나 필요한지 모르겠습니다.
 나는 이전에 들어본 적이 없기 때문에 이것을 언급하고 싶습니다.
 나는 또한 경력 발전에 대한 메시지를 반복하고 싶습니다.
 이웃들이 내가 여기에 사는 것을 알고 그렇게 말했다고 들었습니다. 저는 이곳에 8년 동안 살았기 때문에 이웃을 아는 행운이 있지만 아직 연락하지 않은 새로운 이웃도 몇 명 있습니다.
 그러므로 이러한 회의와 현재 진행 중인 계획에 대한 정보를 쉽게 찾을 수 있다면 가장 좋습니다.
 그리고 노예의 벽과 다른 벽들이 언제 만들어졌는지에 대해 조금 말씀해주세요.
 다시 한 번 불운을 말하자면, 우리 앞에는 양동이가 놓여 있습니다.
 차가 멈추고 사람들은 팟캐스트를 사용하기 시작할 것입니다.
 작업이 완료된 후 몇 달 또는 최소한 몇 주 동안 그대로 유지됩니다.
 내 다음 직업이 주방과 관련이 있을지는 모르겠지만 만약 그렇다면요.
 플러그를 꽂고 제대로 작동하는지 확인하세요. 그래야 근무 시간보다 더 오래 그곳에 머물 필요가 없습니다.
 음, 이것들은 제가 제안한 것 중 일부에 불과합니다.
 감사합니다
 정말 감사합니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6140.425s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: 실제로 회의에 대한 정보가있었습니다.
 고마워요, 제가 개를 산책시키고 있는데 누군가가 못을 박은 걸 알았습니다. 고마워요.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6162.239s">[SPEAKER_02]</a>: 예, 저는 이 정보를 실제로 Diana에 있는 이웃에게서도 배웠지만 안타깝게도 Diana에서는 그렇지 않았습니다.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6171.566s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 오늘 밤 마무리하기 전에 다른 생각 있으신가요?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6176.912s">[hsUGO5ihrRw_SPEAKER_31]</a>: 아니요. 하지만 사람들이 정보를 얻을 수 있는 곳이 있으면 이메일을 보낼 때 알려야 한다는 점을 분명히 하고 싶습니다. 예를 들어, 갈 곳이 있으면 주변을 둘러보도록 하겠습니다.
 몇 년 전 Yahoo에는 모두가 참여하는 채팅 포럼이 있었습니다.
 하지만 지금 이런 상황이 발생한다면 우리는 그러한 자원을 활용하여 우리가 사용할 수 있는 모든 자원을 활용하려고 노력하고 싶습니다.
 제인, 우리가 디자인 작업을 계속하거나 그런 식으로 시도해 볼 수도 있고, 또 다른 회의가 있으면 영향을 미칠 세금 계산서를 생각해 낼 수도 있을 것입니다.
 적어도 집에서는.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/MCM00001628&t=6217.961s">[Jennifer Keenan]</a>: 네, 내 생각엔 Dennis와 제가 수도요금에 관해 이야기하고 있었던 것 같아요.
 힘들었습니다.
 이메일을 올바르게 설정해야 하는 것과 같습니다.
 불행하게도 우리는 예산이 부족하고 이를 실현하기 위해 시와 협력해야 합니다.
 그래서 우리는 여러분의 말을 듣고, 우리가 할 수 있는 것이 무엇인지 알아보고, 그것을 하려고 노력할 것입니다.
 그를 구하려고 노력합시다. 어쩌면 그와 함께 뭔가를 할 수도 있습니다.
 근처에서 걸어갈 수 있습니다.
 우리는 몇 가지 아이디어를 갖고 있으며 오늘 밤 귀하의 피드백에 진심으로 감사드립니다.
 이번 회의 이후에도 의견이 있으신 경우 위원회에 이메일을 보내주시기 바랍니다.
 이것은 확실히 프로세스의 끝이 아닙니다.
 이것은 시작 또는 중간이며 피드백을 환영합니다.
 우리 메일링 리스트에 가입하고 싶으시면 메일링 리스트를 보내주시면 이메일을 보내 귀하가 우리 목록에 있는지 확인하겠습니다.
 우리는 언제나 의견과 제안을 환영합니다.
 항상 감사드립니다.
 오늘 밤 와주신 모든 분들께 감사드립니다.
 90분 넘게 여기 있어주셔서 감사합니다. 나중에 뵙겠습니다.
 매우 감사합니다.
 좋은 저녁이에요</p>
