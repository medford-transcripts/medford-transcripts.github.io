1
00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:03,733
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so welcome everybody for coming this evening.

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:15,129
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a small group here on the zoom, but we are also broadcast live on TV, and we are, we are always going to play in repeats as well.

3
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:19,132
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're hoping more people will watch this online after the fact.

4
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:21,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So good evening this evening, everybody.

5
00:00:21,794 --> 00:00:25,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for joining us for the first edition of Medford Talks Trash.

6
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:33,784
[SPEAKER_03]: We are here to talk to people about Medford's solid waste contract and to get feedback from people.

7
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:35,837
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Alicia Hunt.

8
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:46,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability for the City of Medford, and I am co-chairing this task force with Tim McGiven, our Commissioner of Public Works.

9
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:59,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I am bringing the sustainability and green to this effort, and Tim is bringing the operations and the continuity to this effort to make sure that you continue to get waste services.

10
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:05,729
[SPEAKER_03]: With us this evening is Madeline Levin, a graduate intern working with our office.

11
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:07,290
[SPEAKER_03]: She's staffing the task force.

12
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:08,651
[SPEAKER_03]: She's doing research.

13
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,132
[SPEAKER_03]: She's doing outreach for us.

14
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:12,674
[SPEAKER_03]: She is the everything for this project.

15
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:17,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And she is working the slides.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,961
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are on Zoom this evening.

17
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:26,727
[SPEAKER_03]: This is being recorded and broadcast live to TV, as I said, at the bottom of your screen.

18
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:32,732
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be a CC button, live transcript, or it might be under more.

19
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:37,116
[SPEAKER_03]: You can click on that to get subtitles for the meeting this evening.

20
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:42,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's on TV, I believe the subtitles are already being broadcast.

21
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:45,817
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a chat button at the bottom.

22
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:49,440
[SPEAKER_03]: You are welcome to use the chat button to ask questions.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:57,105
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll actually have a pretty short presentation, and then we'll have time for questions, or you may raise your hand.

24
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:01,689
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reactions button, and you can use the reactions button.

25
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:10,255
[SPEAKER_03]: If you click that, there'll be a raise hand option, and we'll try and have somebody looking at the actual pictures if you have your video on.

26
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:16,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna turn it over to Madeline to introduce the task force.

27
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:20,780
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we'll just have, thank you, Alicia.

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,745
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just have each of the members of the task force just go ahead and say your name in that order.

29
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:37,333
[SPEAKER_06]: We are missing tonight, Lois, Angelica, Dina, and Yvette, but we've got a few other members on the call tonight.

30
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,117
[SPEAKER_06]: So Steve, I'll start with you.

31
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, sorry.

32
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:48,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's kidding.

33
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi there.

34
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:52,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, all my Wi Fi connection is very shaky.

35
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,724
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm City Councilor Kip Collins.

36
00:02:55,985 --> 00:03:05,072
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Steven that are muted.

37
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:06,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Jim, you're muted.

38
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the unmuted Jim Schumann Task Force member.

39
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:16,218
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Jacqueline Torres, task force member.

40
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are also missing John Doherty tonight.

42
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,223
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I missed his name.

43
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:24,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

44
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:30,069
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, everybody.

45
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:47,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It is time times have changed medford has changed the world has changed resident needs have changed it's time to reevaluate our waste disposal in medford and we really want to hear from everybody we don't want to just sit here in city hall and say what services we think the city needs.

46
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,233
[SPEAKER_03]: We really want to hear from residents about what you all need.

47
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:54,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also want to hear from businesses.

48
00:03:54,495 --> 00:04:03,261
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been emphasizing our resident survey, but I will point out that there is a business survey for business owners to fill out for there as well.

49
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:07,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to hear about trash and recycling, business trash and recycling.

50
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:11,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to hear about what you want for other waste services.

51
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:15,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to us about composting, textiles, electronics, et cetera.

52
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:19,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Why now?

53
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:23,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Our current, we've had waste management for a very long time.

54
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,841
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had many contracts with them.

55
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:31,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually recently become aware that waste management has been our waste hauler since the

56
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:37,938
[SPEAKER_03]: the state privatized waste services and the city went to a private waste hauler.

57
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,759
[SPEAKER_03]: They were actually under a different name then.

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does your voice matter?

59
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,182
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we wanna hear what people want.

60
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:53,647
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of us live here in the city, actually just about every member of the task force and the staff involved in this.

61
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:59,490
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Madeline's actually the only one who's not literally a Medford resident who was involved in this effort.

62
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:08,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the right time to think about rates, services, how we approach waste services here in the city of Medford.

63
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:12,836
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna be doing, the survey will be open through October 1st.

64
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:17,338
[SPEAKER_03]: We already have 300 responses, but we wanna hear from everybody.

65
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:23,841
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 18,000 households in the city of Medford and almost 60,000 residents.

66
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:28,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So 300 is an amazing number for a survey, but it's not everybody.

67
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll be providing back feedback from that survey.

68
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:40,801
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have public interest meetings in October and November and be doing a request for proposals over the winter.

69
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are some examples of the types of questions that we're asking.

70
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:54,276
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also an opportunity to answer just a few questions and say you're done, or you can go on and answer.

71
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:57,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll ask you if you're willing to answer more questions for us.

72
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:01,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And here are just a couple of examples of the kinds of questions that we ask.

73
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,843
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do ask that you respond by October 1st.

74
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:12,724
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are watching this right now, you can do your survey on a phone.

75
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:19,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take your phone and your camera, turn on the camera and point it at the white and gray square.

76
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,026
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a QR code for people not yet familiar with them.

77
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:26,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you scan that, a URL will pop up on your screen.

78
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:30,548
[SPEAKER_03]: You can click on that URL and you can get straight to the survey.

79
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:39,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can type in the URL that is on your screen, which is bit.ly slash Medford Waste.

80
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:46,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So not everybody has a computer.

81
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:51,816
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be watching this on TV yelling at me right now that you don't have a computer and you can't fill it out.

82
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:58,279
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to have volunteers, members of the task force and Madeline are going to be taking turns

83
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:02,390
[SPEAKER_03]: They will be at the Medford Farmers Market from 3 to 5 p.m.

84
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,114
[SPEAKER_03]: for the next three Thursdays, the 8th, 15th, and 22nd.

85
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:10,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you haven't been to the Medford Farmers Market, you should check it out.

86
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,579
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of interesting stuff there, and they always have good music.

87
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:20,384
[SPEAKER_03]: They will also be at the Medford Public Library on Saturdays for the next three weeks from 10 a.m.

88
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:21,005
[SPEAKER_03]: to noon.

89
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:24,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have hard copies in City Hall.

90
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,821
[SPEAKER_03]: here in our office up in room 308 that you can grab anytime and fill out for us.

91
00:07:30,602 --> 00:07:45,006
[SPEAKER_03]: To get more updates and learn more about opportunities, things that's going on with the Solid Waste Force, to learn about the public meetings for October and November, which have not yet actually been scheduled, you can sign up for our newsletter.

92
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:48,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Our office has a newsletter that has a ton of information.

93
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,308
[SPEAKER_03]: We try to put it out about once a month.

94
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,175
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll do it more often when we have something urgent to come out.

95
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:59,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you're welcome to email Madeline, and she can add you to our newsletter.

96
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:06,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Her email address is on the screen, mlevin at gsd.harvard.edu.

97
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:15,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, I don't have that much to say, so we'd be happy to take questions now.

98
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:17,734
[SPEAKER_03]: You can raise your hand in Zoom.

99
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:18,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned this before.

100
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:23,219
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hover over Reactions and click the Raise Hand.

101
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,442
[SPEAKER_03]: You can call us on the phone.

102
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:29,865
[SPEAKER_03]: We have staff in our office right now who can answer it, 781-393-2480.

103
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:40,339
[SPEAKER_03]: or email us questions at OCD at Medford dash ma.gov.

104
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:50,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are watching this later on a repeat, this is if it's not Wednesday, September 7 that you're watching this, you're welcome to email us questions and we will get back to you.

105
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:55,253
[SPEAKER_03]: You can call us during business hours and one of our staff will answer the phone and

106
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:57,555
[SPEAKER_03]: or get back to you about it.

107
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:04,120
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry that I don't have any stunning, crazy information that you're all horrified and reacting to yet.

108
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:13,028
[SPEAKER_03]: We really want to hear from residents about what we should have in waste services before we try to make any changes.

109
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to be quiet now and see if anybody has any questions for us.

110
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:29,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we don't immediately have questions, I'll ask if any of the members of the task force or Tim have anything else they'd like to add.

111
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,763
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we do have a question.

112
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:34,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Eunice, do you wanna ask?

113
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks very much.

114
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Avenue.

115
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Couple of points.

116
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:49,907
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I see that there are currently,

117
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:52,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, first of all, I'll say this.

118
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:54,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're going to do more outreach.

119
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:55,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're doing the survey and things.

120
00:09:55,747 --> 00:10:02,993
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be more meetings coming down the pike, but there are currently 14 participants on the Zoom.

121
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:16,345
[SPEAKER_02]: And if my count is correct, at least half of them, maybe a little bit more, are either on the task force or are city employees.

122
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:18,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So that leaves maybe

123
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:22,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Four or five that are actually interested residents.

124
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,861
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, certainly not a very good showing.

125
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:30,464
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of like you guys are there talking to yourselves.

126
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:38,471
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you're not going to get much public participation when you've got probably four members of the public on here.

127
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:41,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there'll be other things coming down the pike, but.

128
00:10:43,676 --> 00:11:06,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I personally think, and I think I mentioned this in an email to you, Alicia, I'm not sure if you've seen it yet, is that I know it's hard to cram a ton of stuff in that goes on in the city, but to hold a meeting of this magnitude two days after Labor Day weekend, the day after an election, you know, while people are just kind of getting back in the groove after summer,

129
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was a wise idea, but it is what it is.

130
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, actually, can I address that first before your question?

131
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:16,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure thing.

132
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:23,024
[SPEAKER_03]: We are expecting to have meetings in October and November where we're providing information back to the public.

133
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:28,927
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a launch meeting to let the public know about this survey and that we want to hear from you.

134
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:32,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So we needed to have that at the very beginning of our outreach.

135
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,630
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be having a meeting in early October for additional

136
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,092
[SPEAKER_03]: to respond back, and we'll be replaying this.

137
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the very first thing.

138
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:48,979
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also very disappointed that there aren't more people here, but I think people get upset when you have something to tell them that they don't like, and then they show up for the public meeting.

139
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I should have announced that we're getting rid of recycling in Medford, and then we'd get a great turd out tonight, right?

140
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:56,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Possible, yeah.

141
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, this is the launch.

142
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, there's like four members of the public on this meeting.

143
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

144
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:06,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you have a question?

145
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:20,926
[SPEAKER_02]: More of a comment or a suggestion, and I put this in the survey that I filled out as far as what I want with my trash plan, so to speak.

146
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:22,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to have this 1,000 years ago.

147
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:34,639
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the turn of the century, but it used to be that our trash pickup people, if you put it out in the curb, they took it, didn't much matter what it was.

148
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:44,927
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it wasn't electronics, you couldn't put a TV out there, you couldn't put paint out there or anything hazard, but if you put it out there, they took it.

149
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:48,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes it really hard to, you know,

150
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,928
[SPEAKER_02]: on a Saturday, clean out your basement, clean out your garage.

151
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,949
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have a bunch of random crap that you're trying to get rid of.

152
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:59,350
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if it doesn't fit in the bin, then you have to get a dumpster.

153
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,991
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get a bag stir, whatever.

154
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:08,893
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when she was Councilor, Marilonga Kern lobbied for this.

155
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:15,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I'd like to see is in a perfect world, once a month from May through October,

156
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:34,333
[SPEAKER_02]: But if not once a month, at least maybe three, four times or twice is a pickup where whoever vendor is will come along and on your designated day or maybe pick a day and they do the entire city, but just take anything that you put out there.

157
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:40,196
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, other than hazardous or, you know, electronics or appliances and things.

158
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:48,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, maybe Memorial Day weekend, you're, you know, deciding to clean out the garage in the basement or sometime in a weekend in July.

159
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:53,085
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way to get rid of all that stuff that you excavate from your basement.

160
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I would like to see.

161
00:13:56,551 --> 00:14:00,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and we appreciate that Yvette, I'm sorry Yvette, Eunice.

162
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:14,706
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we've been trying to make people aware of is that the city's current contract, it used to not, one of the prices that have escalated over the years is the price per large item.

163
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,269
[SPEAKER_03]: For every large item that a resident puts out, the city pays $25.

164
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't, and that has been in our contract for many, many years.

165
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't charge back to residents at all.

166
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:33,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So while it's actually a very convenient idea for residents, we can't afford that under this current contract.

167
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:36,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is helpful to know that that's something that residents would like.

168
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:40,838
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've been trying to figure out how to manage that.

169
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:46,266
[SPEAKER_03]: The state would actually really like us to pass on charges for bulky items.

170
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:51,193
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll actually bribe us, they'll bribe us, sorry, they'll give us some, there are various,

171
00:14:52,598 --> 00:15:06,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that they will incentivize communities to do and charging for large items, at least $5 an item is something that they would like to see communities do to manage waste right now.

172
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:20,530
[SPEAKER_03]: We've tried to put information in our brochure about how to get other groups to come to pickups of large items that are worthwhile, simply because the costs of those bulky items have gotten very, very unmanageable for the city.

173
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:24,420
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't even know that it's necessarily a large items.

174
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're talking like furniture and things like that.

175
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:30,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's even necessarily that.

176
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:36,473
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just, you know, my understanding and, you know, please correct me if I'm wrong, but

177
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:40,934
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't sit in the bin currently, you cannot get rid of it.

178
00:15:42,695 --> 00:16:00,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So even things like, I have a couple of, you know, old mops and brooms and things that I would like to get rid of, you know, just stuff that, you know, sort of accumulates, you know, some wood, some, you know, various things.

179
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:03,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even name them, but they're not big bulky things.

180
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:05,826
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just things that just don't fit in the bin.

181
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:13,189
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's, you know, I would just like a, you know, Thursday, they come and take whatever I put out there.

182
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

183
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:19,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And waste management wants to charge us for every one of those things.

184
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:27,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you probably are aware that if you have smaller things, wood that can be made smaller, you can buy overflow bags.

185
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:32,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that a roll of bags is $10 and you can put out overflow.

186
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:42,135
[SPEAKER_03]: But it appears that they are charging us for everything that people put out outside their bins.

187
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:48,364
[SPEAKER_03]: which is part of one of the many things that we need to address in the new contract.

188
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:49,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, exactly.

189
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, what I'd like to see addressed.

190
00:16:52,227 --> 00:17:02,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I would, you know, next time you, you know, decide to clean out your basement or your garage, you know, look around and see what you're trying to get rid of.

191
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:08,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's just all sorts of, you know, random stuff that, you know, you can't seem to find an easy way to get rid of.

192
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:13,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So in redoing the contract, that would be something I'd like to see.

193
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:14,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

194
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:23,590
[SPEAKER_03]: It is perhaps helpful to let people know that you can take extra recycling at any time to the DPW yard.

195
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:29,611
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a compactor there now that was being filled up three times a week when it was just a dumpster.

196
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,411
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have a compactor that's emptied once a week.

197
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,912
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a scrap metal recycling bin.

198
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:43,533
[SPEAKER_03]: So if things are scrap metal, you can take it to DPW and dump it in the scrap metal bin there.

199
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thanks.

200
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:50,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got a bunch of heavy metal things out of my, my basement that way.

201
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:58,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just, you know, just all sorts of strange random crap that, you know, you need to find a way to get rid of.

202
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

203
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:02,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

204
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:09,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there other people who would like to share their thoughts and opinions or questions with us?

205
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:15,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see that this also the survey is available in multiple languages.

206
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:26,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Madeline has posted links in the chat to the Residential Survey in English, Arabic, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Spanish.

207
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,790
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as the business survey.

208
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:33,734
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is available there and it is available in multiple languages.

209
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,960
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're making those available on our website page as well.

210
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure somebody else has something else for us.

211
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:02,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we'll wrap this up early.

212
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:18,458
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll also, Madeline, can you put this, the version up that has the QR code for the survey so that if people are watching this later on TV, it's easy for them to get back to the survey?

213
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:23,113
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, so you'll have that available.

214
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:30,635
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can always contact us at OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

215
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,097
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll jump in with a question.

216
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:44,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Teresa Dupont, staff member for the city of Medford, also a resident.

217
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,540
[SPEAKER_00]: Question and comment that I have, maybe so much more is like a request, I think,

218
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:58,588
[SPEAKER_00]: having some attention paid to recycling grocery bags and film products.

219
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:04,630
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a call I get all the time here about how do I recycle grocery bags.

220
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:09,513
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now it seems like the onus is really to direct people towards grocery stores.

221
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:13,575
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Wegmans has a recycling program, I believe Stop and Shop does as well.

222
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:20,498
[SPEAKER_00]: So having something city sponsored or having collection bins at public buildings

223
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:26,013
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond the grocery store environment, I think would be something I'd like to personally see.

224
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:33,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that those bags end up in recycling bins and totally ruins the entire recycling process.

225
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:36,610
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a comment, if you will.

226
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:38,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

227
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:39,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, that's true.

228
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:48,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually had the opportunity to tour some of the recycling sorting stations in the Boston area.

229
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:55,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually seen both Casella's and waste management's and neither one of them has the capability of dealing with plastic bags.

230
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:57,396
[SPEAKER_03]: and thin films.

231
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:13,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at the very beginning of their sorting line, they have people who pull the plastic bags and thin film off the conveyor belt, because if they go too far, they jam up the equipment.

232
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:18,859
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll actually wrap, they have large spools that break up glass

233
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:25,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the plastic bags make it there, they wrap around them and they jam them up.

234
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:34,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And so periodically they have to stop the line and have people get up onto the spools that break the glass and cut the plastic films.

235
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,480
[SPEAKER_03]: off of that.

236
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have some great photos of that that we should put back up.

237
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're on the website, but we'll get them.

238
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:47,885
[SPEAKER_03]: We should link to some of the recycling images that we have from some of our sorting facilities.

239
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:56,068
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite fascinating.

240
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:00,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Other questions?

241
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:15,719
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not seeing very much, and while I could talk trash and recycling all evening, I don't want to keep people here longer than necessary.

242
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything that anybody would like to add from the committee?

243
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:18,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim?

244
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:28,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was just gonna add, Alicia, about Denise's comment on extra trash.

245
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:31,370
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also get an extra bin, but you have to pay for it.

246
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,171
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter which way you look at it, they want more money from you.

247
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:35,951
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think another bin is $50.

248
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:39,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

249
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:41,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see that Kit has her hands up.

250
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:45,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Alicia.

251
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:52,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, before we sign off, I just wanted to jump in and say, of course, big thanks to the 300 folks that have already filled out the survey.

252
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,071
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important that we hear from as many people as possible.

253
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:59,894
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're filling it out, you know, ideally, the questions will prompt you to be thinking this way.

254
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:20,430
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's both about how can this better suit for you for your current needs, your current waste and recycling disposal needs, and also the aspirational, what would you like to see that you're not currently seeing the version of whether that's iterating on current, how waste is picked up, how frequently recycling other add-ons like textile composting, so it's both.

255
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,623
[SPEAKER_04]: How's the status quo working for you as well as what are you not seeing that you'd like to be considered?

256
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:28,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks in advance to everybody who fills out the survey.

257
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:29,206
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important.

258
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you to everybody.

259
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:40,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm getting the report that there are no emails and there are no phone calls.

260
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:49,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you everybody for coming and we appreciate it.

261
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Be in touch.

262
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:54,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And sign up for our office newsletter and make sure you listen.

263
00:23:54,722 --> 00:24:02,011
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have some meetings in October and November where we'll be providing more feedback and running some, our ideas by you all.

264
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:03,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

265
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:04,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you everybody.

266
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:06,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.
