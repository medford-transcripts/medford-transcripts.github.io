1
00:00:00,308 --> 00:00:03,733
All right, so welcome everybody for coming this evening.

2
00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:15,129
We have a small group here on the zoom, but we are also broadcast live on TV, and we are, we are always going to play in repeats as well.

3
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:19,132
So we're hoping more people will watch this online after the fact.

4
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:21,754
So good evening this evening, everybody.

5
00:00:21,794 --> 00:00:25,758
Thank you for joining us for the first edition of Medford Talks Trash.

6
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:33,784
We are here to talk to people about Medford's solid waste contract and to get feedback from people.

7
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:35,837
My name is Alicia Hunt.

8
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:46,221
I am the Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability for the City of Medford, and I am co-chairing this task force with Tim McGiven, our Commissioner of Public Works.

9
00:00:47,061 --> 00:00:59,926
I am bringing the sustainability and green to this effort, and Tim is bringing the operations and the continuity to this effort to make sure that you continue to get waste services.

10
00:01:00,966 --> 00:01:05,729
With us this evening is Madeline Levin, a graduate intern working with our office.

11
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:07,290
She's staffing the task force.

12
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:08,651
She's doing research.

13
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,132
She's doing outreach for us.

14
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:12,674
She is the everything for this project.

15
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:17,177
And she is working the slides.

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,961
So we are on Zoom this evening.

17
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:26,727
This is being recorded and broadcast live to TV, as I said, at the bottom of your screen.

18
00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:32,732
There might be a CC button, live transcript, or it might be under more.

19
00:01:33,152 --> 00:01:37,116
You can click on that to get subtitles for the meeting this evening.

20
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:42,100
And if it's on TV, I believe the subtitles are already being broadcast.

21
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:45,817
There's a chat button at the bottom.

22
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:49,440
You are welcome to use the chat button to ask questions.

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:57,105
We'll actually have a pretty short presentation, and then we'll have time for questions, or you may raise your hand.

24
00:01:57,646 --> 00:02:01,689
There's a reactions button, and you can use the reactions button.

25
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:10,255
If you click that, there'll be a raise hand option, and we'll try and have somebody looking at the actual pictures if you have your video on.

26
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:16,737
So I'm gonna turn it over to Madeline to introduce the task force.

27
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:20,780
Yeah, we'll just have, thank you, Alicia.

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,745
We'll just have each of the members of the task force just go ahead and say your name in that order.

29
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:37,333
We are missing tonight, Lois, Angelica, Dina, and Yvette, but we've got a few other members on the call tonight.

30
00:02:41,176 --> 00:02:42,117
So Steve, I'll start with you.

31
00:02:43,576 --> 00:02:45,377
Okay, sorry.

32
00:02:46,238 --> 00:02:48,059
Oh, it's kidding.

33
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,521
Hi there.

34
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:52,943
Sorry, all my Wi Fi connection is very shaky.

35
00:02:53,323 --> 00:02:54,724
I'm City Councilor Kip Collins.

36
00:02:55,985 --> 00:03:05,072
My name is Steven that are muted.

37
00:03:05,613 --> 00:03:06,934
Oh, Jim, you're muted.

38
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,458
Now the unmuted Jim Schumann Task Force member.

39
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:16,218
I'm Jacqueline Torres, task force member.

40
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,080
Great.

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,942
And we are also missing John Doherty tonight.

42
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,223
I think I missed his name.

43
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:24,445
Great.

44
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:30,069
So thank you, everybody.

45
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:47,673
It is time times have changed medford has changed the world has changed resident needs have changed it's time to reevaluate our waste disposal in medford and we really want to hear from everybody we don't want to just sit here in city hall and say what services we think the city needs.

46
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,233
We really want to hear from residents about what you all need.

47
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:54,435
And we also want to hear from businesses.

48
00:03:54,495 --> 00:04:03,261
We've been emphasizing our resident survey, but I will point out that there is a business survey for business owners to fill out for there as well.

49
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:07,664
So we want to hear about trash and recycling, business trash and recycling.

50
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:11,047
And we want to hear about what you want for other waste services.

51
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:15,530
Talk to us about composting, textiles, electronics, et cetera.

52
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:19,753
Why now?

53
00:04:20,254 --> 00:04:23,398
Our current, we've had waste management for a very long time.

54
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:25,841
We've had many contracts with them.

55
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:31,488
I actually recently become aware that waste management has been our waste hauler since the

56
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:37,938
the state privatized waste services and the city went to a private waste hauler.

57
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,759
They were actually under a different name then.

58
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,641
Why does your voice matter?

59
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,182
Because we wanna hear what people want.

60
00:04:46,743 --> 00:04:53,647
Many of us live here in the city, actually just about every member of the task force and the staff involved in this.

61
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:59,490
I think Madeline's actually the only one who's not literally a Medford resident who was involved in this effort.

62
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:08,754
And this is the right time to think about rates, services, how we approach waste services here in the city of Medford.

63
00:05:09,774 --> 00:05:12,836
We're gonna be doing, the survey will be open through October 1st.

64
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:17,338
We already have 300 responses, but we wanna hear from everybody.

65
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:23,841
There are 18,000 households in the city of Medford and almost 60,000 residents.

66
00:05:24,301 --> 00:05:28,103
So 300 is an amazing number for a survey, but it's not everybody.

67
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,207
And then we'll be providing back feedback from that survey.

68
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:40,801
We'll have public interest meetings in October and November and be doing a request for proposals over the winter.

69
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:47,108
Here are some examples of the types of questions that we're asking.

70
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:54,276
There's also an opportunity to answer just a few questions and say you're done, or you can go on and answer.

71
00:05:54,316 --> 00:05:57,200
It'll ask you if you're willing to answer more questions for us.

72
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:01,105
And here are just a couple of examples of the kinds of questions that we ask.

73
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,843
So we do ask that you respond by October 1st.

74
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:12,724
If you are watching this right now, you can do your survey on a phone.

75
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:19,005
You can take your phone and your camera, turn on the camera and point it at the white and gray square.

76
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:22,026
That is a QR code for people not yet familiar with them.

77
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:26,287
And if you scan that, a URL will pop up on your screen.

78
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:30,548
You can click on that URL and you can get straight to the survey.

79
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:39,471
Or you can type in the URL that is on your screen, which is bit.ly slash Medford Waste.

80
00:06:44,994 --> 00:06:46,754
So not everybody has a computer.

81
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:51,816
You might be watching this on TV yelling at me right now that you don't have a computer and you can't fill it out.

82
00:06:52,977 --> 00:06:58,279
We are going to have volunteers, members of the task force and Madeline are going to be taking turns

83
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:02,390
They will be at the Medford Farmers Market from 3 to 5 p.m.

84
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:07,114
for the next three Thursdays, the 8th, 15th, and 22nd.

85
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:10,256
And if you haven't been to the Medford Farmers Market, you should check it out.

86
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,579
There's a lot of interesting stuff there, and they always have good music.

87
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:20,384
They will also be at the Medford Public Library on Saturdays for the next three weeks from 10 a.m.

88
00:07:20,484 --> 00:07:21,005
to noon.

89
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:24,047
And we have hard copies in City Hall.

90
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,821
here in our office up in room 308 that you can grab anytime and fill out for us.

91
00:07:30,602 --> 00:07:45,006
To get more updates and learn more about opportunities, things that's going on with the Solid Waste Force, to learn about the public meetings for October and November, which have not yet actually been scheduled, you can sign up for our newsletter.

92
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:48,347
Our office has a newsletter that has a ton of information.

93
00:07:48,387 --> 00:07:50,308
We try to put it out about once a month.

94
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,175
But we'll do it more often when we have something urgent to come out.

95
00:07:54,896 --> 00:07:59,402
Or you're welcome to email Madeline, and she can add you to our newsletter.

96
00:08:00,383 --> 00:08:06,451
Her email address is on the screen, mlevin at gsd.harvard.edu.

97
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:15,232
And really, I don't have that much to say, so we'd be happy to take questions now.

98
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:17,734
You can raise your hand in Zoom.

99
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:18,915
I mentioned this before.

100
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:23,219
You can hover over Reactions and click the Raise Hand.

101
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,442
You can call us on the phone.

102
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:29,865
We have staff in our office right now who can answer it, 781-393-2480.

103
00:08:35,575 --> 00:08:40,339
or email us questions at OCD at Medford dash ma.gov.

104
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:50,809
And if you are watching this later on a repeat, this is if it's not Wednesday, September 7 that you're watching this, you're welcome to email us questions and we will get back to you.

105
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:55,253
You can call us during business hours and one of our staff will answer the phone and

106
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:57,555
or get back to you about it.

107
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm sorry that I don't have any stunning, crazy information that you're all horrified and reacting to yet.

108
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:13,028
We really want to hear from residents about what we should have in waste services before we try to make any changes.

109
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,372
So I'm going to be quiet now and see if anybody has any questions for us.

110
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:29,222
And if we don't immediately have questions, I'll ask if any of the members of the task force or Tim have anything else they'd like to add.

111
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,763
Oh, we do have a question.

112
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:34,704
Eunice, do you wanna ask?

113
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,004
Yeah, thanks very much.

114
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,705
Eunice Brown, Greenleaf Avenue.

115
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:45,266
Couple of points.

116
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:49,907
First of all, I see that there are currently,

117
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:52,544
Oh, first of all, I'll say this.

118
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:54,085
I know you're going to do more outreach.

119
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:55,727
I know you're doing the survey and things.

120
00:09:55,747 --> 00:10:02,993
There'll be more meetings coming down the pike, but there are currently 14 participants on the Zoom.

121
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:16,345
And if my count is correct, at least half of them, maybe a little bit more, are either on the task force or are city employees.

122
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:18,126
So that leaves maybe

123
00:10:19,454 --> 00:10:22,957
Four or five that are actually interested residents.

124
00:10:23,618 --> 00:10:26,861
So that's, you know, certainly not a very good showing.

125
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:30,464
You know, it's kind of like you guys are there talking to yourselves.

126
00:10:31,145 --> 00:10:38,471
So, you know, you're not going to get much public participation when you've got probably four members of the public on here.

127
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:41,935
I know there'll be other things coming down the pike, but.

128
00:10:43,676 --> 00:11:06,730
You know, I personally think, and I think I mentioned this in an email to you, Alicia, I'm not sure if you've seen it yet, is that I know it's hard to cram a ton of stuff in that goes on in the city, but to hold a meeting of this magnitude two days after Labor Day weekend, the day after an election, you know, while people are just kind of getting back in the groove after summer,

129
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:11,459
I don't think it was a wise idea, but it is what it is.

130
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,061
Secondly, actually, can I address that first before your question?

131
00:11:16,081 --> 00:11:16,721
Sure thing.

132
00:11:17,381 --> 00:11:23,024
We are expecting to have meetings in October and November where we're providing information back to the public.

133
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:28,927
This is a launch meeting to let the public know about this survey and that we want to hear from you.

134
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:32,228
So we needed to have that at the very beginning of our outreach.

135
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,630
We'll be having a meeting in early October for additional

136
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,092
to respond back, and we'll be replaying this.

137
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,493
So this is the very first thing.

138
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:48,979
I'm also very disappointed that there aren't more people here, but I think people get upset when you have something to tell them that they don't like, and then they show up for the public meeting.

139
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,484
So maybe I should have announced that we're getting rid of recycling in Medford, and then we'd get a great turd out tonight, right?

140
00:11:55,844 --> 00:11:56,565
Possible, yeah.

141
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,126
Right, this is the launch.

142
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:04,470
Basically, there's like four members of the public on this meeting.

143
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:05,170
Yeah.

144
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:06,432
So did you have a question?

145
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:20,926
More of a comment or a suggestion, and I put this in the survey that I filled out as far as what I want with my trash plan, so to speak.

146
00:12:21,066 --> 00:12:22,668
And we used to have this 1,000 years ago.

147
00:12:25,153 --> 00:12:34,639
back in the turn of the century, but it used to be that our trash pickup people, if you put it out in the curb, they took it, didn't much matter what it was.

148
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:44,927
As long as it wasn't electronics, you couldn't put a TV out there, you couldn't put paint out there or anything hazard, but if you put it out there, they took it.

149
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:48,429
And it makes it really hard to, you know,

150
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:51,928
on a Saturday, clean out your basement, clean out your garage.

151
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:54,949
You just have a bunch of random crap that you're trying to get rid of.

152
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:59,350
And, you know, if it doesn't fit in the bin, then you have to get a dumpster.

153
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,991
You have to get a bag stir, whatever.

154
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:08,893
And I think when she was counselor, Marilonga Kern lobbied for this.

155
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:15,615
But what I'd like to see is in a perfect world, once a month from May through October,

156
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:34,333
But if not once a month, at least maybe three, four times or twice is a pickup where whoever vendor is will come along and on your designated day or maybe pick a day and they do the entire city, but just take anything that you put out there.

157
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:40,196
you know, other than hazardous or, you know, electronics or appliances and things.

158
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:48,262
But, you know, maybe Memorial Day weekend, you're, you know, deciding to clean out the garage in the basement or sometime in a weekend in July.

159
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:53,085
There's no way to get rid of all that stuff that you excavate from your basement.

160
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,327
So that's what I would like to see.

161
00:13:56,551 --> 00:14:00,835
Right, and we appreciate that Yvette, I'm sorry Yvette, Eunice.

162
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:14,706
One of the things that we've been trying to make people aware of is that the city's current contract, it used to not, one of the prices that have escalated over the years is the price per large item.

163
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,269
For every large item that a resident puts out, the city pays $25.

164
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:23,429
And we don't, and that has been in our contract for many, many years.

165
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,490
And we don't charge back to residents at all.

166
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:33,834
So while it's actually a very convenient idea for residents, we can't afford that under this current contract.

167
00:14:34,214 --> 00:14:36,956
So it is helpful to know that that's something that residents would like.

168
00:14:38,257 --> 00:14:40,838
But we've been trying to figure out how to manage that.

169
00:14:41,378 --> 00:14:46,266
The state would actually really like us to pass on charges for bulky items.

170
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:51,193
They'll actually bribe us, they'll bribe us, sorry, they'll give us some, there are various,

171
00:14:52,598 --> 00:15:06,004
Things that they will incentivize communities to do and charging for large items, at least $5 an item is something that they would like to see communities do to manage waste right now.

172
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:20,530
We've tried to put information in our brochure about how to get other groups to come to pickups of large items that are worthwhile, simply because the costs of those bulky items have gotten very, very unmanageable for the city.

173
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:24,420
But I don't even know that it's necessarily a large items.

174
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,784
I think you're talking like furniture and things like that.

175
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:30,527
I don't think it's even necessarily that.

176
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:36,473
I think it's just, you know, my understanding and, you know, please correct me if I'm wrong, but

177
00:15:37,072 --> 00:15:40,934
If it doesn't sit in the bin currently, you cannot get rid of it.

178
00:15:42,695 --> 00:16:00,283
So even things like, I have a couple of, you know, old mops and brooms and things that I would like to get rid of, you know, just stuff that, you know, sort of accumulates, you know, some wood, some, you know, various things.

179
00:16:00,343 --> 00:16:03,805
I can't even name them, but they're not big bulky things.

180
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:05,826
They're just things that just don't fit in the bin.

181
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:13,189
you know, that's, you know, I would just like a, you know, Thursday, they come and take whatever I put out there.

182
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:15,088
Right?

183
00:16:15,608 --> 00:16:19,389
And waste management wants to charge us for every one of those things.

184
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:27,351
So I think you probably are aware that if you have smaller things, wood that can be made smaller, you can buy overflow bags.

185
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:32,992
And I believe that a roll of bags is $10 and you can put out overflow.

186
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:42,135
But it appears that they are charging us for everything that people put out outside their bins.

187
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:48,364
which is part of one of the many things that we need to address in the new contract.

188
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:49,705
Right, exactly.

189
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,147
And that's, you know, what I'd like to see addressed.

190
00:16:52,227 --> 00:17:02,075
And, you know, I would, you know, next time you, you know, decide to clean out your basement or your garage, you know, look around and see what you're trying to get rid of.

191
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:08,240
And, you know, it's just all sorts of, you know, random stuff that, you know, you can't seem to find an easy way to get rid of.

192
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:13,084
So in redoing the contract, that would be something I'd like to see.

193
00:17:13,948 --> 00:17:14,888
Great, thank you.

194
00:17:16,228 --> 00:17:23,590
It is perhaps helpful to let people know that you can take extra recycling at any time to the DPW yard.

195
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:29,611
We have a compactor there now that was being filled up three times a week when it was just a dumpster.

196
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,411
So now we have a compactor that's emptied once a week.

197
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:36,912
We also have a scrap metal recycling bin.

198
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:43,533
So if things are scrap metal, you can take it to DPW and dump it in the scrap metal bin there.

199
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,223
Okay, thanks.

200
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:50,545
Yeah, I got a bunch of heavy metal things out of my, my basement that way.

201
00:17:51,525 --> 00:17:58,088
Yeah, just, you know, just all sorts of strange random crap that, you know, you need to find a way to get rid of.

202
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,288
Yeah.

203
00:18:02,018 --> 00:18:02,858
Great, thank you.

204
00:18:03,078 --> 00:18:09,380
Are there other people who would like to share their thoughts and opinions or questions with us?

205
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:15,582
I do see that this also the survey is available in multiple languages.

206
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:26,906
Madeline has posted links in the chat to the Residential Survey in English, Arabic, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Spanish.

207
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,790
as well as the business survey.

208
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:33,734
So it is available there and it is available in multiple languages.

209
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,960
And we're making those available on our website page as well.

210
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,881
I'm sure somebody else has something else for us.

211
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:02,423
I mean, we'll wrap this up early.

212
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:18,458
We'll also, Madeline, can you put this, the version up that has the QR code for the survey so that if people are watching this later on TV, it's easy for them to get back to the survey?

213
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:23,113
Great, so you'll have that available.

214
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:30,635
And then you can always contact us at OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

215
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,097
I'll jump in with a question.

216
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:44,058
Teresa Dupont, staff member for the city of Medford, also a resident.

217
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:50,540
Question and comment that I have, maybe so much more is like a request, I think,

218
00:19:51,184 --> 00:19:58,588
having some attention paid to recycling grocery bags and film products.

219
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:04,630
That's a call I get all the time here about how do I recycle grocery bags.

220
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:09,513
And right now it seems like the onus is really to direct people towards grocery stores.

221
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:13,575
I know Wegmans has a recycling program, I believe Stop and Shop does as well.

222
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:20,498
So having something city sponsored or having collection bins at public buildings

223
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:26,013
beyond the grocery store environment, I think would be something I'd like to personally see.

224
00:20:26,034 --> 00:20:33,585
Because I know that those bags end up in recycling bins and totally ruins the entire recycling process.

225
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:36,610
So just a comment, if you will.

226
00:20:37,762 --> 00:20:38,262
Thank you.

227
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:39,623
And yes, that's true.

228
00:20:39,643 --> 00:20:48,510
I've actually had the opportunity to tour some of the recycling sorting stations in the Boston area.

229
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:55,995
I've actually seen both Casella's and waste management's and neither one of them has the capability of dealing with plastic bags.

230
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:57,396
and thin films.

231
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:13,613
And so at the very beginning of their sorting line, they have people who pull the plastic bags and thin film off the conveyor belt, because if they go too far, they jam up the equipment.

232
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:18,859
They'll actually wrap, they have large spools that break up glass

233
00:21:19,787 --> 00:21:25,832
And if the plastic bags make it there, they wrap around them and they jam them up.

234
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:34,280
And so periodically they have to stop the line and have people get up onto the spools that break the glass and cut the plastic films.

235
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,480
off of that.

236
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,802
I actually have some great photos of that that we should put back up.

237
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,823
I think they're on the website, but we'll get them.

238
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:47,885
We should link to some of the recycling images that we have from some of our sorting facilities.

239
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:56,068
It's quite fascinating.

240
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:00,890
Other questions?

241
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:15,719
I am not seeing very much, and while I could talk trash and recycling all evening, I don't want to keep people here longer than necessary.

242
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:18,680
Is there anything that anybody would like to add from the committee?

243
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:18,760
Tim?

244
00:22:24,007 --> 00:22:28,088
Yeah, I was just gonna add, Alicia, about Denise's comment on extra trash.

245
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:31,370
You can also get an extra bin, but you have to pay for it.

246
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,171
So no matter which way you look at it, they want more money from you.

247
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:35,951
But I think another bin is $50.

248
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:39,252
Great, thank you.

249
00:22:39,773 --> 00:22:41,573
And I see that Kit has her hands up.

250
00:22:44,354 --> 00:22:45,014
Thanks, Alicia.

251
00:22:45,034 --> 00:22:52,077
Yeah, before we sign off, I just wanted to jump in and say, of course, big thanks to the 300 folks that have already filled out the survey.

252
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,071
It's really important that we hear from as many people as possible.

253
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:59,894
And when you're filling it out, you know, ideally, the questions will prompt you to be thinking this way.

254
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:20,430
But I think it's both about how can this better suit for you for your current needs, your current waste and recycling disposal needs, and also the aspirational, what would you like to see that you're not currently seeing the version of whether that's iterating on current, how waste is picked up, how frequently recycling other add-ons like textile composting, so it's both.

255
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,623
How's the status quo working for you as well as what are you not seeing that you'd like to be considered?

256
00:23:26,324 --> 00:23:28,485
So thanks in advance to everybody who fills out the survey.

257
00:23:28,505 --> 00:23:29,206
It's really important.

258
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,229
Yes, thank you to everybody.

259
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:40,294
And I'm getting the report that there are no emails and there are no phone calls.

260
00:23:44,096 --> 00:23:49,500
So thank you everybody for coming and we appreciate it.

261
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,441
Be in touch.

262
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:54,702
And sign up for our office newsletter and make sure you listen.

263
00:23:54,722 --> 00:24:02,011
We'll have some meetings in October and November where we'll be providing more feedback and running some, our ideas by you all.

264
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:03,914
Great.

265
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:04,835
Thank you everybody.

266
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:06,597
Good night.
