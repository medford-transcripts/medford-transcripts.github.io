1
00:00:11,218 --> 00:00:14,360
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'm calling the meeting to order.

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:27,067
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee on Tuesday, March 12, 6.30 p.m., and today is our annual public hearing.

3
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:35,170
[SPEAKER_08]: So this meeting of Medford's Community Preservation Committee is being conducted via remote participation.

4
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:48,194
[SPEAKER_08]: No in-person attendance of members of the public is permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in the order.

5
00:00:49,935 --> 00:00:55,737
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will post a recording of this meeting on the city website as soon as possible after the meeting.

6
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:00,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, welcome to everyone.

7
00:01:01,258 --> 00:01:10,002
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to begin with a very brief presentation with a background about CPA.

8
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:20,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we have a few new committee members and some staff in attendance who may not be familiar with all of it.

9
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:27,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So Teresa, we didn't discuss, are you planning to give the presentation or am I giving the presentation?

10
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,210
[SPEAKER_01]: I can certainly do that if you'd like.

11
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sure.

12
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,151
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so everybody should be seeing my screen right now.

13
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:38,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thank you all so much for coming out tonight.

14
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give us a little overview of 2023.

15
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:51,716
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as a quick overview of CPA for those who are unfamiliar, could use a refresher.

16
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:55,678
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a state act program that was enacted in year 2000.

17
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:03,605
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows communities to raise funds at the local level for local projects with local input.

18
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,426
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all very local.

19
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:10,730
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Medford, it was voted in by voters in 2015.

20
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,933
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started collecting surcharge in fiscal year 2017.

21
00:02:16,774 --> 00:02:19,035
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, we also appointed a committee.

22
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:26,080
[SPEAKER_01]: The committee is made up of experts of most of our boards and commissions, our conservation,

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:34,722
[SPEAKER_01]: historical, our community development, which is our planning board, our parks commission, as well as the local housing authority person.

24
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:41,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do have two mayoral appointees, which at this point, I will plug saying that we do have two openings on our committee.

25
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:48,345
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who is watching this and would be more interested in getting involved, please, we'd love to see your application.

26
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, just as overview of CPA here, this is nothing new.

27
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:05,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the applications we get, we have to look at them in terms of eligibility and the letters of the law of how we can spend money.

28
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:07,172
[SPEAKER_01]: So this chart is my best friend at work.

29
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:15,057
[SPEAKER_01]: even though I've been immersed in CPA for a while, it's very nice, very specific as to what we can do here.

30
00:03:15,177 --> 00:03:26,987
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't dive into everything here, but it's just, this is available on our website and it's just very clearly identifies how we can spend the money on our specific categories.

31
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,210
[SPEAKER_01]: CPA focuses on open space and recreation.

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are gonna be your parks, your athletic fields,

33
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:37,637
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that is out in the open.

34
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:43,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Historic preservation is another big bucket that CPA can help fund.

35
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:48,582
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those are your public buildings here in the area that have historic value to the community.

36
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:59,327
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, we also focus on housing and ways to produce, support, create affordable housing here in our community for our members.

37
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:12,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is just a graphic overview of the funds that projects that were funded in fiscal year 24, which is our previous year here.

38
00:04:13,971 --> 00:04:17,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So the graph just depicts how this money was distributed.

39
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:25,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say it's completely evenly, but that's a nice healthy kind of two third or three thirds here pie graph here.

40
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:33,479
[SPEAKER_01]: The green on the left where we spent $944, 944,000 is for open space and recreation.

41
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,245
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go over the specific projects here shortly just to give you an overview of how the pot of money was divided.

42
00:04:42,466 --> 00:04:46,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, about 944,000 for open space and recreation.

43
00:04:47,009 --> 00:04:50,731
[SPEAKER_01]: In affordable housing there, we spent about 869,000.

44
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And in historic preservation, the orange slice at the bottom

45
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,454
[SPEAKER_01]: about 728,000 went towards preserving historic properties here in Medford.

46
00:05:01,315 --> 00:05:05,999
[SPEAKER_01]: So all told, all that math adds up to just over about $2.5 million.

47
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:14,806
[SPEAKER_01]: We were blessed last year to be able to have some rollover funds that were carried over and able to be spent out.

48
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:18,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spent about $2.5 million last year.

49
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,532
[SPEAKER_01]: We received 19 applications

50
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,491
[SPEAKER_01]: 16 of which we were found to be eligible.

51
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:36,637
[SPEAKER_01]: We always kind of get some great projects that we absolutely would love to fund, but unfortunately, it has to be eligible by the ACT legal language there.

52
00:05:36,717 --> 00:05:50,225
[SPEAKER_01]: So nine of which of those 16 applications that we funded, nine were for historic preservation projects around the city, five were for open space, and then two were for affordable housing.

53
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:56,542
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into the specifics here as we're looking into the actual projects that were funded.

54
00:05:56,882 --> 00:06:03,604
[SPEAKER_01]: This slide makes me so happy to talk about just because you can see how the funding is distributed across the city.

55
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:09,525
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of our applicants, they've returned to us and asked for more funding.

56
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:16,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the Royal House, we were happy to help them with a project a couple of years ago for the slave quarters building.

57
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the Royal Mansion needed some work here.

58
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:23,844
[SPEAKER_01]: friends over at M-BELT, which is the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust.

59
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:28,486
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to fund a couple more projects at the Brooks Estate, which is great.

60
00:06:29,426 --> 00:06:36,909
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as we're going into like our parks projects here, Tufts and Cape and Park, their basketball court is going to be resurfaced.

61
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay, we're very excited about that.

62
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:42,552
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Logan Park,

63
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:58,195
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be seeing a playground refacing with some natural play elements, which we're really excited about, as well as, you know, big one, the big ones, the McGlynn School universally accessible playground, broke ground.

64
00:06:59,035 --> 00:07:02,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I want to say it was November, it may have been December, there was snow on the ground.

65
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:06,237
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're happy to see that that project is underway.

66
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:12,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be such a great asset for our community here to be able to have an accessible playground.

67
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:26,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and in our housing, you know, I'm not going to dive into every single project here, but, um, for our housing projects here, we continue to support the homelessness prevention program, which is a program.

68
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:26,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Oops.

69
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have ABCD here.

70
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:29,174
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unfortunate.

71
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:29,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

72
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:32,255
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's housing families, my error there.

73
00:07:33,015 --> 00:07:39,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so housing families helps with, uh, folks they're facing eviction.

74
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:43,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if they have rental arrears, it helps them with any back rent that's due.

75
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:48,481
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a great, great resource here in the city and we're so happy for their partnership.

76
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:59,993
[SPEAKER_01]: The Medford Housing Authority, we continue to fund the development there by funding another 800,000 and we're very excited about that project.

77
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:06,399
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of excitement going on, but we're very excited about it because that's going to bring 90, I believe it's 94 new units

78
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:12,487
[SPEAKER_01]: to that development that's so hugely needed here in the city.

79
00:08:12,507 --> 00:08:17,270
[SPEAKER_01]: We were honored to be partnered on that.

80
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So next steps.

81
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:23,253
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all the great stuff we did last year.

82
00:08:23,373 --> 00:08:23,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess what?

83
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,974
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to do it again this year.

84
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:31,598
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're happy to report out our timeline with our dates here.

85
00:08:31,638 --> 00:08:34,399
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2024 applications will be available on July 8th.

86
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,961
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who are

87
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:42,942
[SPEAKER_01]: watching that our repeat applicants or have reached out to me with interest, we will be sending out reminders on this.

88
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:54,290
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't feel like you need to scribble it on a post-it note, but July 8th, sorry, I'm letting somebody in from the waiting room, applications will be available.

89
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,774
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have our eligibility determination forms due on July 31st.

90
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:02,055
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, reminders will go out.

91
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:04,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be your partner throughout this whole process.

92
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Full applications will be due September 10th.

93
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:14,304
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already got the applicant presentation dates picked out for October 8th and 22nd.

94
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:21,588
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really trying to firm up those dates so people can plan their lives, especially the fall is always a very busy time for folks.

95
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:26,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, November, December this year will deliberate.

96
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:29,229
[SPEAKER_01]: Um internally is as well as in public.

97
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:35,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Um it will deliberate after hearing the presentations and then submit to City Council for their approval.

98
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:41,556
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's pretty much our timeline here for 2024.

99
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:49,301
[SPEAKER_01]: So here are some of the elements that are available in the city that we use as we look at our our

100
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:55,254
[SPEAKER_01]: our priorities as a committee and hearing back feedback from our community.

101
00:09:55,334 --> 00:10:14,922
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2017, at the establishment of this committee, we wrote a community preservation plan, which I'm not sure when we'll be looking to update that again, but every year we do an annual plan update where we take pieces of that 2017 community preservation plan.

102
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:24,622
[SPEAKER_01]: We also utilize these next three, open space and recreation plan, housing production plan, and comprehensive plan.

103
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:32,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Those all were citywide efforts led by the Office of Planning Development and Sustainability and Community Development, as it was before.

104
00:10:32,326 --> 00:10:45,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So these highlight what specific needs are in each neighborhood, as well as a total citywide plan of how we're going to improve across the city.

105
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:50,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I will also tout that we have published our survey.

106
00:10:50,898 --> 00:10:57,002
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great that if you're here with us right now, if you're watching it back, we would love your feedback.

107
00:10:57,562 --> 00:11:07,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Our survey is live and it is available on the city's website as well as here on the screen, tinyurl.com forward slash CPA 02155.

108
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:13,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna take feedback from that survey as well as any feedback that we gain here at the public hearing.

109
00:11:14,012 --> 00:11:14,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And

110
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:19,717
[SPEAKER_01]: use that as we formulate our plan for the coming year.

111
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,742
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a little graphic here that's highlighting some of our upcoming listening sessions.

112
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:31,803
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one held on Zoom Sunday evening.

113
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,534
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be at the public library tomorrow from five to seven.

114
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:37,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out with me on the second floor.

115
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:48,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next Tuesday, March 19th, from 11 to 12, we will be at the senior center taking more of kind of casual one-on-one conversations, not so much of a formal presentation.

116
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:52,867
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to be hearing from folks about what they'd like to be seeing in our community.

117
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:58,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I think I'll turn it back over to Roberta.

118
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,354
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Teresa.

119
00:12:04,044 --> 00:12:18,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So before we move on to ask for your input, I just wanted to see if there are any questions about the information that Teresa's just presented to us.

120
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:30,492
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, thank you everyone who is attending this evening.

121
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:34,796
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to frame the conversation that we're going to have.

122
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:43,542
[SPEAKER_08]: So as Teresa mentioned, every year we give an update to the community preservation plan.

123
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:48,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So what the committee is looking for is to think about overall whether there are

124
00:12:52,570 --> 00:13:17,835
[SPEAKER_08]: to look at changes in the context, what's going on in the city, what's happened recently, what's on the horizon, what do we anticipate coming up that affects each of these program areas so that the committee can think about whether we want to tweak our priorities or our procedures to reflect on how things are going in the city.

125
00:13:20,836 --> 00:13:33,181
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we may not have, you know, we're obviously not going to have answers about what are we going to fund this year, but we're really interested in hearing about what does the committee need to know?

126
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:48,528
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we anticipate coming up and what kinds of questions should we be prepared to discuss and consider this year as we evaluate the proposals coming forward?

127
00:13:49,143 --> 00:13:54,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted with, um, thank you to the PDS staff who are here.

128
00:13:54,509 --> 00:14:02,179
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to begin the conversation with on the subject of open space recreation.

129
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:03,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and then, um.

130
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:15,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first we can begin with open space recreation and just kind of an overall, what do we see going on around the city?

131
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:22,474
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'd like to delve a little more deeply into affordable housing and historic preservation.

132
00:14:25,436 --> 00:14:35,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, I'd like to open the floor and ask if Alicia, Amanda, you want to share anything that's going on?

133
00:14:36,022 --> 00:14:36,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

134
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Amanda was waiting for me to start.

135
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you unmuted first, so I think you should take it away.

136
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:50,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Alicia, for joining us tonight.

137
00:14:50,476 --> 00:15:04,308
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, as Roberta mentioned, if you want to give us kind of an overview of your experience with CPA, and then kind of take it from there, just talk about your experience with CPA.

138
00:15:05,455 --> 00:15:21,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so I think that Amanda can really get into the weeds on a lot of the stuff so for those of you who aren't aware, our office has been managing parks and open space upgrades renovations etc for the city, like capital improvements.

139
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:31,787
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing projects that include partnerships with like DCR and MassDOT for like shared paths, as well as park renovations.

140
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:32,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done everything.

141
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:41,930
[SPEAKER_06]: When it's very little park renovation, very small, like get a quote and have it installed, then usually DPW will handle that kind of project.

142
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:49,973
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it needs design work, when we need to hire a designer, when we need to do community outreach and get input, then our office oversees it.

143
00:15:51,008 --> 00:16:01,018
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that in a very big picture way, I really like the CPA for is because we can use this money for things.

144
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:06,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Often when we go for a grant, construction grants, they expect shovel ready projects.

145
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:14,011
[SPEAKER_06]: They want, if not full designs ready to go to bid, they want like detailed conceptuals.

146
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:19,216
[SPEAKER_06]: sketches, they want strong estimates, and they want to know that there's community support.

147
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:22,939
[SPEAKER_06]: So Medford has, relatively speaking, a small staff.

148
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:32,126
[SPEAKER_06]: So we look to CPA funding to actually fund that work, right, to hire the consultants to go out and talk to the public along with our staff.

149
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:46,170
[SPEAKER_06]: to understand the needs of the community, the needs of the park or the area or the open space, and to get the conceptual sketches done that we can then use to get bigger grants.

150
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:57,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And Amanda could speak very specifically, I think, but the model that we, if anybody has specific questions about the project, but the model that we used at Carr Park where the CPA funded upfront money

151
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:06,316
[SPEAKER_06]: where all we knew was that Carr Park was old and needed new stuff and needed renovation.

152
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:19,821
[SPEAKER_06]: And we were able to hire a consultant who could help us do extensive community outreach, understand community needs, draw up concept sketches, do some iterations, and help us put together.

153
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:23,342
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Amanda was able to apply for millions in dollars

154
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:29,086
[SPEAKER_06]: in state and federal grants to then be able to do the construction on that project.

155
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:42,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we ask CPA to help with some of the pockets of things, the smaller things in that park, particularly whenever there are things that are harder to get federal and state funding for.

156
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:46,401
[SPEAKER_06]: So conceptually, that's what we're looking at and what we like to see.

157
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:51,045
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some, we've been hearing about if people are like, well, what's next?

158
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,146
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some noise about Placedead Park.

159
00:17:53,226 --> 00:17:55,048
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some noise about Tufts Park.

160
00:17:55,728 --> 00:18:04,355
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also, we had been hearing about Barry Park, are all some things and we need to figure out what are the priorities of the city as to where we're going to go next.

161
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:13,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I say that because we have been hearing from the schools about Placedead and its importance with the baseball field to the Medford High School.

162
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:26,934
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've been hearing from the rec department that is basing a lot of rec programs out of Tufts Park, because of the proximity of Tufts pool, it gives them a building that they can run operations out of during the summer.

163
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:34,381
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just sort of, it's sort of like whetting your appetite for what's to come we still need to determine where we're going to be applying for things.

164
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:44,128
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'd be happy to actually speak as well about some of the more the cross between historic and open space.

165
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:57,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to mention that because of Oak Grove our cemetery and the Brooks estate are both very historic things that the city owns and not all the members of the public realize that we own it.

166
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:02,365
[SPEAKER_06]: and we need to maintain it, and it has future potential for revenue generating.

167
00:19:02,825 --> 00:19:10,068
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are also big open spaces there, and people go there for walks and for exercise.

168
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:19,772
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to, we have really found that particularly, I've heard from older people who want to walk someplace that they feel is a little bit more safe.

169
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:28,218
[SPEAKER_06]: that Oak Grove is a good place to walk around because they're not fighting with traffic, et cetera, particularly the paved roads in there.

170
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:38,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just kind of mentioned that because a lot of, usually those applications come in under historic, but they really, they can go both ways.

171
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:47,113
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can also talk a little bit about that when we come to historic, if you want, although I see that we have some of our historic experts on the call tonight.

172
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:53,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Amanda, do you want to add some more specifics about where we are with parks and open space and planning?

173
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:59,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, I think you gave a really great overview, and I can just add that

174
00:20:01,737 --> 00:20:13,005
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that we'll be looking at, I don't think it'll be so applicable this funding round for CPA, but our current open space and recreation plan is slotted for 2019 through 2026.

175
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're going to need a plan update in the nearest term.

176
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:22,492
[SPEAKER_05]: I think realistically, we, the city will ought to be looking at.

177
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:32,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting that process in the fall and winter of this year, so that, you know, come early 2026 we're all set with a plan.

178
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:40,549
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think CPC, the CPC should be part of that conversation that the city will have with

179
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:56,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Likely a consultant team and with the greater community at large, a part of that effort, I think, ought to also include sort of an inventory of all of our open space spaces and facilities.

180
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:58,182
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking at some of.

181
00:20:58,762 --> 00:21:22,851
[SPEAKER_05]: that kind of you know in a conceptual way but also looking at like the specifics of what we have in our open spaces and you know maybe going so far as understanding you know maintenance timelines in a kind of big picture way for various things so just sort of wanted to flag that as something that's going to be coming up on the horizon and that will really inform

182
00:21:23,832 --> 00:21:25,633
[SPEAKER_05]: city steps moving forward on that.

183
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:40,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think also to add to what Alicia was saying, this sort of model of applying for CPA funds to fund design and outreach has been extremely successful on our end.

184
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:45,779
[SPEAKER_05]: It really sets up the city for being able to apply for other funding out there.

185
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:50,641
[SPEAKER_05]: And other grant timelines make it very difficult to apply for design

186
00:21:52,744 --> 00:22:07,764
[SPEAKER_05]: With construction, you sort of would have to do, you'd probably probably apply for design only and then would have to wait for, you know, a new funding period or a different opportunity to figure out the construction piece of it.

187
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:16,126
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the case of both Carr Park and Ylis, which design was funded by CPA, it's been extremely helpful.

188
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:26,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And I could see that being a model we use going forward, in particular for some of the larger renovations that are on the horizon that Alicia mentioned.

189
00:22:26,148 --> 00:22:28,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So potentially Tufts or Playstead.

190
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:31,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll break there.

191
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,329
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are any specific questions, I'm happy to answer them.

192
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:37,650
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also know we've got other folks who have great insight to share.

193
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:41,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

194
00:22:41,495 --> 00:22:46,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there questions from committee members about the open space recreation projects?

195
00:22:55,483 --> 00:23:05,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to make a request, and you're probably already doing this, but it would be very helpful to include a mention in our plan update

196
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:13,553
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe to keep track of how much funding has been leveraged for these projects.

197
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:26,623
[SPEAKER_08]: So for each of the CPA projects that was part of funding that other, we had other funding sources that contributed to it.

198
00:23:27,183 --> 00:23:36,130
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to be able to see what the whole numbers are for those projects and how much CPA has actually leveraged for each of the program areas.

199
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug, thank you.

200
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:48,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just a quick question.

201
00:23:48,371 --> 00:24:06,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that's come up, I think, a couple of times over the last few years was looking at when we're evaluating the city of Medford, you know, it's a new park, you know, a resurfacing of a lot, rehab of, you know, it seems like there's a big park every year, which has been understandable and appreciated.

202
00:24:07,997 --> 00:24:09,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we be looking to the

203
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:17,734
[SPEAKER_04]: The last open space plan to be our guide for the context in which that request is made in terms of priorities and potential budgets.

204
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:21,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that's a question for you, Amanda, or somebody else.

205
00:24:23,403 --> 00:24:24,404
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to jump in.

206
00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:32,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I think absolutely that the Open Space and Recreation Plan ought to guide what we prioritize.

207
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:41,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that we've been looking to in the conversations that we've been having about Playstead Barrie, Tufts, and in thinking about to

208
00:24:43,757 --> 00:24:49,961
[SPEAKER_05]: that we are putting out a new request for qualifications for on-call landscape architect firms.

209
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,283
[SPEAKER_05]: We did that about three years ago.

210
00:24:52,303 --> 00:24:56,165
[SPEAKER_05]: And those contracts are about to be up at the end of April.

211
00:24:56,205 --> 00:25:02,109
[SPEAKER_05]: So we thought it was a very successful model for getting work done efficiently.

212
00:25:02,189 --> 00:25:03,390
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're doing it again.

213
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:10,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And in thinking about that, one of the things that we flagged in looking through the open space

214
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:20,714
[SPEAKER_05]: plan is, you know, is opportunities to integrate green infrastructure and resilient resiliency into our existing open spaces.

215
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:29,219
[SPEAKER_05]: and facilities, and that the OSRP is a really excellent guide for doing that work.

216
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:45,933
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we'll need to, as part of the next plan update, sort of assess what's been accomplished of the plan and, you know, prioritize or reevaluate what our most urgent next steps ought to be.

217
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:47,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

218
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:52,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And I might add for that just so I was one of the department heads that worked on the old open space plan.

219
00:25:53,764 --> 00:25:56,485
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did it in my role as the sustainability director.

220
00:25:56,505 --> 00:26:01,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also our Office of Community Development, which they're planning the department.

221
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,086
[SPEAKER_06]: They managed it.

222
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I was not in that department at that time.

223
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:15,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And the that plan was really good at the resiliency because we got an additional add on grant to look at climate resiliency and green infrastructure.

224
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:19,108
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was one of the first OSRPs in the state that did that.

225
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:21,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's required of OSRPs.

226
00:26:23,772 --> 00:26:27,975
[SPEAKER_06]: What we didn't really have the funding to do was a huge amount of outreach.

227
00:26:28,396 --> 00:26:32,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked to stakeholders, there was some surveys, but it wasn't.

228
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:41,447
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we say looking at it to guide what we're doing, it's really good at saying, this is where this infrastructure, this park needs a renovation.

229
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:45,729
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it starts to say, what should you actually do to it?

230
00:26:46,189 --> 00:26:50,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you're just going to upgrade it in kind, you can just kind of use that.

231
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:57,655
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you want to say, what does the community want and need at this location, that outreach still needs to be done.

232
00:26:57,715 --> 00:27:01,557
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a level of depth that we just couldn't.

233
00:27:01,657 --> 00:27:06,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And you couldn't really do it in OSRP because it's one, it's really targeted.

234
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,982
[SPEAKER_06]: And two, you really need to do it closer in time to when you're doing the project.

235
00:27:11,282 --> 00:27:23,367
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can all agree that what people wanna see in their open spaces has changed from 2015, 16 when we were working on that to today when we're actually using that plan.

236
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:32,991
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, I wanna caution, yes, in a big picture, get us there, but then we do wanna be careful about not skimping on community outreach.

237
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:36,392
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't want anybody to say, oh, we did that when we did the plan.

238
00:27:36,412 --> 00:27:39,093
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that clarity.

239
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:40,914
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't take it,

240
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:42,486
[SPEAKER_04]: for anything more than it is.

241
00:27:43,146 --> 00:27:51,951
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess my question is, in terms of dollars, you know, because I've been asked to do the same kind of thing for the Brooks Estate, frankly.

242
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:54,493
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we had a master plan that's 12 years old now.

243
00:27:55,734 --> 00:27:57,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I just dug up the old estimate from 2011, 2012.

244
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:09,082
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been asked by Robert and others to try to guesstimate what it would be today based on what CPC has funded in the last five years

245
00:28:09,576 --> 00:28:11,157
[SPEAKER_04]: plus inflation, plus other things.

246
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:13,818
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm in the process of doing that.

247
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:21,523
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take me a month or so to do that, maybe a little longer because I'm getting an estimate on the road from the actual consultant, Binesh.

248
00:28:22,163 --> 00:28:36,511
[SPEAKER_04]: But I feel like there's almost going to be a one page, maybe a one page just list of projects and numbers, big picture, like just one page that would say, here's the list of priorities as they were, here's what we've checked off, here's 400,000, 800,000, million,

249
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,742
[SPEAKER_04]: just so we get a nice context when we see something coming, we know that it's in this context.

250
00:28:43,782 --> 00:28:47,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know the plan is about to begin updated, but it's, I find that useful.

251
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:51,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think other people would too, to understand that we're not looking at things in a vacuum anymore.

252
00:28:52,766 --> 00:28:54,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Even by order of magnitude.

253
00:28:54,507 --> 00:29:05,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we can tell if this is a hundred thousand dollar kind of improvement, or if we're talking about a million plus or something like that.

254
00:29:06,423 --> 00:29:15,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and maybe I can't flip through it right this moment, but my instinct is that all the numbers in there are low.

255
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:25,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's scary to me is that I remember thinking, wow, these are really big, expensive park renovations when I first flipped through that book.

256
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:33,802
[SPEAKER_06]: But it tended to be things I want to say, maybe you have it, that it was saying like that a park renovation was like one and a half million dollars.

257
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:40,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, when you do what we're doing with car park, it's closer to seven and a half or $8 million.

258
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:48,510
[SPEAKER_06]: But they didn't envision adding a covered basketball court with solar panels.

259
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,532
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't envision water play in the playground.

260
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:54,595
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't envision pickleball courts.

261
00:29:55,115 --> 00:30:00,980
[SPEAKER_06]: We're setting our sights a lot higher than we did when we first did this plan.

262
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:04,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will share, I dropped this in the chat.

263
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:10,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a Go Green, we manage the website Go Green Medford, gogreenmedford.org.

264
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:21,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And on that web page is a parks update web page, which we try to keep updated, but it has like the big picture stuff that's going on.

265
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:27,853
[SPEAKER_06]: But really useful on that, at the top of that is a link to our ongoing

266
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:31,316
[SPEAKER_06]: a spreadsheet, how does it say?

267
00:30:31,356 --> 00:30:35,900
[SPEAKER_06]: The status of ongoing parks projects can be reviewed in this Google spreadsheet.

268
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:43,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And we try to use that and update that once a month or every other month to help the public know.

269
00:30:44,265 --> 00:30:51,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, it was our tracking spreadsheet in-house to understand what's going on and who's the point person, et cetera.

270
00:30:53,351 --> 00:31:01,627
[SPEAKER_06]: that we meet usually monthly with the mayor, our staff, DPW, recreation, forestry,

271
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:10,212
[SPEAKER_06]: finance to go through this spreadsheet and say, where do these projects stand?

272
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:16,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus some of our funders, like Teresa comes for CPA, Laurel for CDBG.

273
00:31:17,315 --> 00:31:22,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So we use this to keep us on track as to where things go.

274
00:31:24,587 --> 00:31:35,316
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to share that there should be a link to the open space and rec plan on that webpage, but I just found that it was broken, probably happened when we updated the city's website.

275
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:38,539
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll have to get that fixed when we're back in the office tomorrow.

276
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:50,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanna say that I really appreciate how much we've leveled up our park open space planning since 2017 when we started doing this.

277
00:31:52,462 --> 00:32:01,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so the current OSRP was developed during, you know, since we had CPA and developing a new one.

278
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:08,234
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, um, I appreciate how much more experience we all have at this.

279
00:32:08,614 --> 00:32:19,502
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, like it just feels like the decisions are so much better coordinated than in the very beginning.

280
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:19,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

281
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,080
[SPEAKER_08]: kudos to all of the city staff for making that happen.

282
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:37,770
[SPEAKER_08]: More questions on this subject or we can, I think, maybe

283
00:32:38,763 --> 00:32:40,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Move to housing next.

284
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:46,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just thinking of having Alicia and or Amanda available.

285
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:50,809
[SPEAKER_08]: What topics we may have the most overlap with them?

286
00:32:50,829 --> 00:33:03,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we're being recorded and people will watch it, but I still have to crack the joke that, oh no, keep me here, because as long as I'm here, I can't be at city council.

287
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:12,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we've actually sent Danielle to cover City Council for us tonight.

288
00:33:12,906 --> 00:33:16,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I really appreciate your making yourself available.

289
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,993
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, do we want to?

290
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Shall I jump in?

291
00:33:25,256 --> 00:33:25,616
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

292
00:33:26,017 --> 00:33:26,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

293
00:33:26,857 --> 00:33:27,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

294
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:29,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Take it away.

295
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:30,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Introduce yourself, please.

296
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:30,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

297
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:31,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

298
00:33:31,858 --> 00:33:32,579
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.

299
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:34,540
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Aditi Mugur.

300
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,783
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the housing planner, and I joined the city of Medford early this year.

301
00:33:39,803 --> 00:33:42,105
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to meet all of you.

302
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:47,649
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to take this opportunity to briefly introduce Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

303
00:33:48,409 --> 00:34:00,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that CPC is excited about the trust fund, so I just want to briefly talk about it and provide you some updates on where we are with the city's Affordable Housing Trust Fund.

304
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:13,900
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you the main goals of Affordable Housing Trust Fund is it would provide for the creation and preservation of affordable housing in a city.

305
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:24,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of its roles could entail providing financial support in construction of affordable homes by profit or not-for-profit developers.

306
00:34:24,945 --> 00:34:47,571
[SPEAKER_00]: implement rehabilitation programs that would convert existing home units into affordable housing, provide financial support to Medford Housing Authority, accept city-owned lands to provide infill developments for affordable housing, provide rental assistance support to low- and moderate-income households.

307
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:52,993
[SPEAKER_00]: But apart from this, the Affordable Housing Trust could act as

308
00:34:53,950 --> 00:35:01,436
[SPEAKER_00]: an advocate or as a role of advocacy, planning, and even policy development.

309
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:14,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So in particular, the Medford's Affordable Housing Trust Fund would primarily address some of the housing production strategies that have been outlined in the housing production plan.

310
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:18,329
[SPEAKER_00]: So as some of you may know that

311
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:29,139
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already had affordable housing trust fund within this region and met in Cambridge and Somerville for nearly 35 years.

312
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've had great success with it.

313
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:45,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, Cambridge was able to create 1500 affordable units and around 250 affordable home ownership units for first time home buyers.

314
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are really hoping that

315
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:54,618
[SPEAKER_00]: The city's affordable housing trust fund would be able to have a similar impact.

316
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:56,740
[SPEAKER_00]: So fingers crossed.

317
00:35:58,041 --> 00:36:05,107
[SPEAKER_00]: And Daniel and I are currently working to review applicants who applied for the board of trustees.

318
00:36:05,687 --> 00:36:12,493
[SPEAKER_00]: So this process would probably take another month or two.

319
00:36:13,174 --> 00:36:16,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are hoping to have the board of trustees

320
00:36:18,032 --> 00:36:21,753
[SPEAKER_00]: up and running by end of spring, early summer.

321
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:27,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are looking to apply for CPC funds.

322
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:30,336
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are hoping that, CPA funds.

323
00:36:30,516 --> 00:36:35,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are hoping that CPA would support in our funding applications.

324
00:36:37,258 --> 00:36:39,798
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, yeah, I'm happy to answer.

325
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,800
[SPEAKER_01]: See if anybody from the committee has any questions.

326
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:56,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we thought it was very important to get that.

327
00:36:56,836 --> 00:37:02,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, first of all, for giving us that overview of that affordable housing trust, you know, it is still so very new.

328
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:16,069
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning more about it is just incredibly helpful, especially since, you know, the whole point of this, this hearing here is to get feedback so that we can formulate our plan later in the year, as we're looking at applications.

329
00:37:16,129 --> 00:37:16,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really good

330
00:37:17,406 --> 00:37:22,928
[SPEAKER_01]: for us to understand the relationship that will be there between the CPC and the Affordable Housing Trust.

331
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:36,793
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what kind of collaboration we'll have in establishing, you know, reporting and, you know, and whatnot, those type of little questions, I'm sure will, there'll be a bunch of those, I'm sure down the road.

332
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:38,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

333
00:37:39,453 --> 00:37:43,715
[SPEAKER_00]: We are really hoping that we'll apply for some funding this year.

334
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:46,476
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, looking forward to

335
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:49,161
[SPEAKER_00]: working together with CPC.

336
00:37:49,942 --> 00:37:50,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

337
00:37:51,282 --> 00:38:15,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to ask maybe if you didn't already mention, what is the timeline you anticipate for having the Affordable Housing Trust Board established and for the board to be ready to start working on answering those questions in collaboration with the CPC?

338
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:25,751
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really hoping that by end of summer or end of spring and early summer, we'll get the board running.

339
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:35,177
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one of the primary tasks would be to have an action plan and then also set up a trust fund account.

340
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:38,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need funding to set up a trust fund account.

341
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:42,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably that'll be one of the first conversations that we are going to have.

342
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:46,264
[SPEAKER_00]: So really looking forward to having this

343
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:50,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Conversation sometime in end of summer.

344
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which is perfect because that aligns with our application period.

345
00:38:57,514 --> 00:38:57,994
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.

346
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:04,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm curious whether, um.

347
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:09,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I can take Alicia your question first and then I'll, okay.

348
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:25,527
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm curious whether committee members have questions or concerns about the future relationship between the CPC and the Affordable Housing Trust.

349
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:33,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Not that we'll have answers now, but I'm thinking ahead about what are the questions that

350
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:41,251
[SPEAKER_08]: we want to, that the Affordable Housing Trust will want to have in mind as they prepare their action plan.

351
00:39:53,228 --> 00:40:01,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I assume that that will be so dependent on how the incoming board decides they want the fund to function.

352
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:10,714
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm super excited that it's getting off the ground and look forward to kind of collaborating and seeing where those opportunities are.

353
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:11,614
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be there.

354
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:15,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say that I have a clear vision in my head of what they are.

355
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:22,558
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's possible that other folks have, you know, worked more closely with Somerville and Cambridge and have a clearer vision.

356
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:22,798
[SPEAKER_07]: But

357
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we'll do it differently.

358
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:31,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Ari.

359
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:38,773
[SPEAKER_11]: I can jump in.

360
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:41,754
[SPEAKER_11]: I would, off the top of my head, don't have questions.

361
00:40:41,834 --> 00:40:46,775
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd want to see what the application and how things are worded looks like in terms of how money is getting allocated.

362
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:49,656
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm probably going to hold off until then.

363
00:40:49,676 --> 00:40:51,956
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, that's fair.

364
00:40:53,897 --> 00:41:14,071
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the questions that I think the committee is going to need to consider before the time comes that we receive an application from the Affordable Housing Trust is when we determine in May what our annual budget is going to be in terms of

365
00:41:15,603 --> 00:41:18,586
[SPEAKER_08]: putting money into the reserve accounts.

366
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:28,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Typically, in most years, we've put the minimum 10% into each of the reserves in our annual budget.

367
00:41:29,715 --> 00:41:43,146
[SPEAKER_08]: There was at least one year when we made that 20% anticipating that or having observed that the affordable housing requests the previous year

368
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,928
[SPEAKER_08]: there hadn't been any requests in the previous year.

369
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:59,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So trying to make sure that we kept up our pace in affordable housing spending, we front loaded the money that we put into reserve for affordable housing.

370
00:42:00,612 --> 00:42:11,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So we may as a committee be thinking about whether we want to continue the minimum 10, 10, 10,

371
00:42:12,992 --> 00:42:18,175
[SPEAKER_08]: Distribution or whether we want to consider some other distribution.

372
00:42:18,295 --> 00:42:25,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Some communities have give 50% or more into affordable housing with the remaining being divided between

373
00:42:32,576 --> 00:42:35,677
[SPEAKER_08]: open space and recreation and historic preservation.

374
00:42:36,617 --> 00:42:43,358
[SPEAKER_08]: But some communities prefer to have the flexibility of each year deciding where the money is most needed.

375
00:42:43,378 --> 00:42:58,702
[SPEAKER_08]: And Medford, although we have distributed the funds overall fairly evenly between the three program areas, that's mostly been with flexible

376
00:43:01,973 --> 00:43:12,840
[SPEAKER_08]: response to the applications that are received rather than deciding, determining in advance that we're going to use the funds, distribute them evenly.

377
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a question that the committee is going to need to reflect on in the next month.

378
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:25,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think another thing to think on is, Aditi, from what you were saying,

379
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:33,721
[SPEAKER_01]: it sounds like there might be overlap, like we might have similar applications that you will hear for funding that we would also hear under housing.

380
00:43:34,282 --> 00:43:45,065
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I know you mentioned that there will be an action plan, but maybe that's something we can think of is how would we, you know, mitigate overlap?

381
00:43:45,765 --> 00:43:47,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that just front loading?

382
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:52,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly what it would be, but we might have to, I think we should think on that.

383
00:43:54,643 --> 00:43:56,805
[SPEAKER_00]: we should find a way to streamline the process.

384
00:43:57,225 --> 00:44:09,677
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the applications on affordable housing developments would come through the affordable housing trust fund, but that is something the board needs to also decide and work on.

385
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:12,660
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good question to think about.

386
00:44:19,912 --> 00:44:24,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there more questions or comments with respect to the affordable housing trust?

387
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe then I'll segue if I might.

388
00:44:33,678 --> 00:44:38,802
[SPEAKER_06]: because one of the things that I did wanna just sort of mention sort of somewhat for the record.

389
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So we met last week with the Medford Housing Authority.

390
00:44:42,745 --> 00:44:50,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that they talk about that I will say to be clear, so Aditi works in my office.

391
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:53,874
[SPEAKER_06]: I've asked her to become the expert on the Affordable Housing Trust.

392
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:56,856
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot answer any questions she cannot answer.

393
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:06,263
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the things is this idea, just like the parks, of pre-development money.

394
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:11,867
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually a legitimate actual term in housing development is pre-development.

395
00:45:12,387 --> 00:45:24,816
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is this idea of saying, I have an idea and I need to pay somebody to get sketches and drawings and to run finances and to understand what we can and cannot do here.

396
00:45:25,707 --> 00:45:32,517
[SPEAKER_06]: and to get things that are into a place where you can apply for multi-million dollar grants.

397
00:45:33,218 --> 00:45:36,543
[SPEAKER_06]: The housing authority, we're talking tens of millions and hundreds of millions.

398
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,201
[SPEAKER_06]: not the little bits that we apply for, for the parks.

399
00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:57,527
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have been working with affordable housing developers and starting, and some of them may have their own pre-development money, some may come to us for some pre-development, and some of it is simply that, yes, they have staff, but the state looks to see that the city

400
00:45:58,067 --> 00:45:59,588
[SPEAKER_06]: is invested in these projects.

401
00:46:00,108 --> 00:46:18,476
[SPEAKER_06]: And so whether the money comes from the Affordable Housing Trust or from the CPA or from the city's general fund, which we all know right now is not happening in the short run, we need, is that there is city skin in the game for doing these affordable housing projects.

402
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:26,480
[SPEAKER_06]: We've also written letters of support for the Medford Housing Authority to get state grants saying the city wants to see this.

403
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,102
[SPEAKER_06]: but the money talks louder than the words.

404
00:46:29,763 --> 00:46:46,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And so having, even though it feels like the hundreds of thousands of dollars we give them is nothing compared to the tens of millions of dollars and hundreds of millions in some cases that they need for their projects, it actually is meaningful in terms of

405
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,765
[SPEAKER_06]: showing to the state that we are part of this project.

406
00:46:50,546 --> 00:47:12,763
[SPEAKER_06]: And so whether it's the Medford Housing Authority or a non-profit housing developer that we might be talking to or might come independently, I will say that if a non-profit housing authority comes to the CPA, we would ask that they come and talk to my office and work with Aditi so that we're all on the same page, so we're not working at cross-purposes with each other,

407
00:47:13,443 --> 00:47:20,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so that if you're getting an application from one of them, you should actually also have our backing saying we want to see this project move forward.

408
00:47:20,788 --> 00:47:28,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and we will be looking at municipal property that may be available that we could use for affordable housing.

409
00:47:28,394 --> 00:47:31,656
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one of the things that's on our radar for the coming years.

410
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:34,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

411
00:47:34,118 --> 00:47:35,159
[SPEAKER_08]: That's helpful to know.

412
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:36,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug?

413
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:38,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, Alicia.

414
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:41,263
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the, at our very last meeting, we were having kind of a

415
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:48,047
[SPEAKER_04]: lessons learned debrief for the last year, and in some ways, the first five years of CPC.

416
00:47:48,067 --> 00:48:04,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things we batted around was what is the best way to leverage affordable housing funds to get the most units out of the system, whatever system we're plugging into, whether it's, you know, there's so many different ways you can do it.

417
00:48:04,512 --> 00:48:08,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I think every affordable housing project ever built has been a unique model, it seems.

418
00:48:09,918 --> 00:48:23,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for example, you know, we did a couple hundred thousand, you know, the round before this, and we did 600,000 for, or more than that, actually, for this, the last round off cycle.

419
00:48:24,824 --> 00:48:35,308
[SPEAKER_04]: But the first was really kickstart the project and really show the local, and it was, that was the one that was noted in the Boston Globe as a very positive way the Method's doing it.

420
00:48:35,908 --> 00:48:38,069
[SPEAKER_04]: The second one was, I viewed it as,

421
00:48:40,132 --> 00:48:47,934
[SPEAKER_04]: 2% of a much larger project and I was just wondering out loud and I would ask the DT and yourself and anyone else there is like, what can you recommend.

422
00:48:48,755 --> 00:48:53,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we spend our dollars to get the most units, the most leverage, the most affordable housing here.

423
00:48:53,936 --> 00:48:56,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on what, you know, what you've seen so far.

424
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:01,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, that's a great question and something we've been thinking about.

425
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,043
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will just preface it and be honest in that Medford's new in the affordable housing game.

426
00:49:07,423 --> 00:49:22,651
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not something that anybody in the city on staff, I've got to say, we have affordable housing developers who are residents in the city and I encourage them to come talk to my office, volunteer with us, volunteer with the affordable housing trust in this board.

427
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,833
[SPEAKER_06]: But that said, it's new to the administration.

428
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:30,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been trying to figure out what's the best way to do this.

429
00:49:33,475 --> 00:49:43,999
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an instinct that what we should be doing is working with affordable housing developers and looking at projects that are like 30 to 60 units, because that would be all affordable.

430
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:54,343
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other hand, there is a lot to be said about projects where that's where the people live who couldn't afford their own housing at market rate.

431
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:54,923
[SPEAKER_06]: We might

432
00:49:57,944 --> 00:50:13,174
[SPEAKER_06]: not love the way the 40Bs came to us and are happening, we might in the future bring forward a friendly 40B where we actually encourage a developer to do something that is 75% market rate and 25% affordable, because that's a lot of affordable housing

433
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:21,902
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's no stigma attached to any of it, right?

434
00:50:21,962 --> 00:50:26,447
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know who in that building is in an affordable unit versus the market rate unit.

435
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:29,431
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not a bad thing to be doing.

436
00:50:30,192 --> 00:50:35,518
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't be asking for CPA money for that, would be looking for CPA money

437
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:47,881
[SPEAKER_06]: If we had a affordable housing developer who wanted to do 30 or 40 units, that's pretty standard in our surrounding communities, and Medford's never done it.

438
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:53,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Never intentionally, as far as we have an awareness of, done it.

439
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,025
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something that we are working on.

440
00:50:58,364 --> 00:51:14,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, frankly, our Medford Housing Authority is excellent in what they're doing, and they're doing the smartest thing possible, is that they have Cambridge, who is tons of money and tons of experience, working as their project managers and advisors to do it.

441
00:51:15,295 --> 00:51:16,836
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not reinventing the wheel.

442
00:51:17,196 --> 00:51:19,377
[SPEAKER_06]: They have somebody super experienced helping them.

443
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:25,701
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not a for-profit developer who is, or for-profit consultant advising them, right?

444
00:51:25,741 --> 00:51:26,882
[SPEAKER_06]: It's another housing authority.

445
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:36,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have to say, if you were questioning between the first round and the second round, well, if you hadn't done that first round 100,000, that project would not have happened.

446
00:51:38,656 --> 00:51:45,639
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that I think CPA is particularly useful for and should think about is the gap funding, right?

447
00:51:45,919 --> 00:52:02,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody goes out and gets millions of dollars, and now they've had a change order, or the design shifted and they're short a couple of hundred thousand dollars here, or there's something that's not allowable under the grant that they got.

448
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:14,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, where were the places that CPA can fill in for the Affordable Housing Trust, which we're still learning about, that, like, they can't use other money or they can't use their tax credits on?

449
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:19,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes that might be the thing that makes the building a little bit better, right?

450
00:52:19,542 --> 00:52:26,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, CDBG is paying for community gardens at public housing, right?

451
00:52:26,407 --> 00:52:30,731
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to get federal funds for that, I don't think, although CDBG is federal.

452
00:52:30,811 --> 00:52:31,972
[SPEAKER_06]: But, right, it's different.

453
00:52:33,168 --> 00:52:43,396
[SPEAKER_06]: So thinking about what can, what do they need that, and asking them straight up, like, what are the things you need that other grants can't pay for?

454
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:51,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, you know, that's where I think we're the most useful because we're small, but we're so flexible.

455
00:52:51,422 --> 00:52:54,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

456
00:52:54,324 --> 00:52:54,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

457
00:52:54,645 --> 00:52:54,965
[SPEAKER_04]: That's helpful.

458
00:53:02,102 --> 00:53:16,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Your question and response bring to mind maybe it could be helpful to hear a little more about the context and what do you see on the horizon for affordable housing?

459
00:53:16,866 --> 00:53:22,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Like what has changed in the last year or two and what do you see coming?

460
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:28,804
[SPEAKER_06]: First thing I'm gonna say, we have a full-time housing planner for the first time.

461
00:53:30,244 --> 00:53:42,990
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like a full-time housing specialist in the city back before 2014, but it's been a very long time since the city's had a full-time housing planner.

462
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,311
[SPEAKER_06]: So that has changed.

463
00:53:44,811 --> 00:53:48,413
[SPEAKER_06]: But that said, DT has only been with us since mid-January.

464
00:53:49,793 --> 00:54:00,760
[SPEAKER_06]: So Aditi, are you comfortable talking about like any of the developers you've been talking to, sites you've been like, I don't know how detailed about sites we want to be, but other than we own property, but.

465
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:07,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we are looking at two, three different city owned lands.

466
00:54:07,764 --> 00:54:13,567
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are some developers who are interested to propose affordable housing units.

467
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:30,921
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're also figuring out how to convey city-owned lands to affordable housing developers, and this is a conversation that's been ongoing, but we're really excited to see how this process goes, but also looking at the housing production plan and seeing how

468
00:54:31,503 --> 00:54:39,368
[SPEAKER_00]: The affordable housing trust funds action plan aligns with the housing production plan is also pretty important.

469
00:54:40,088 --> 00:54:46,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are hoping that these initiatives will fill the gaps and move things forward.

470
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:50,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

471
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,875
[SPEAKER_06]: That's actually really helpful.

472
00:54:51,895 --> 00:54:52,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

473
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:52,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

474
00:54:52,896 --> 00:54:55,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are not the Medford square lots.

475
00:54:56,178 --> 00:54:59,720
[SPEAKER_06]: These are other smaller properties that we're looking at.

476
00:55:01,695 --> 00:55:16,747
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's actually really helpful for us to know that there are conversations that are on the horizon in the pipeline that could result in CPA requests in the next year or two.

477
00:55:17,628 --> 00:55:29,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So just to think that what we've seen as a pace for affordable housing requests might not reflect what's coming in the future given the

478
00:55:30,642 --> 00:55:38,687
[SPEAKER_08]: increased effort that we're making in PDS to generate more activity in that area.

479
00:55:38,707 --> 00:55:52,615
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could just echo what Alicia said earlier about the Friendly 40B, I actually was the project manager for Davis companies when they built 270 units in an office park.

480
00:55:52,695 --> 00:55:55,537
[SPEAKER_04]: They converted an empty lot into affordable housing in the

481
00:55:55,945 --> 00:56:00,426
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason it was a friendly 40B is they were no abutters, they were the abutters, they own the whole thing.

482
00:56:00,526 --> 00:56:13,430
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was literally no opposition because there was no one, the abutters was their own property and it gave them quite a number of affordable units in a relatively short period of time.

483
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:17,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And the quality of the building was as good as any market rate building I've ever built.

484
00:56:18,232 --> 00:56:21,573
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no distinction at all.

485
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:23,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Legally, it's impossible to do that.

486
00:56:23,753 --> 00:56:25,714
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have an affordable unit that's one quality

487
00:56:26,222 --> 00:56:28,343
[SPEAKER_04]: and everything else, every unit is the same.

488
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:34,105
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't even decide which are affordable until they're almost done with construction because it doesn't matter.

489
00:56:34,886 --> 00:56:36,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really a win-win for everyone.

490
00:56:36,566 --> 00:56:38,527
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can make it work at Medford, it's a great idea.

491
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:45,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

492
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:50,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Any more questions or observations with respect to affordable housing?

493
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:05,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I would like to move the conversation on to historic preservation, and we have Ryan Hayward and Doug.

494
00:57:06,778 --> 00:57:11,201
[SPEAKER_08]: both representing the Historical Commission.

495
00:57:11,221 --> 00:57:22,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd be very interested to hear what you see on the horizon, what changes have occurred, as well as from PDS.

496
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:27,874
[SPEAKER_08]: What changes have occurred or do we anticipate in this area?

497
00:57:29,014 --> 00:57:30,014
[SPEAKER_08]: in the near future.

498
00:57:30,635 --> 00:57:47,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm interested in particularly city buildings that have need for historic preservation, city properties, as we've been making improvements to some historic parks and cemeteries.

499
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:55,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would love to invite you to share what you know.

500
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:03,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, do you want to jump in on this?

501
00:58:03,623 --> 00:58:08,647
[SPEAKER_04]: I can start with the things that I'm close to, obviously, with the Brooks Estate and the Oak Grove Cemetery.

502
00:58:09,408 --> 00:58:21,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I think those are two, it was mentioned earlier, that those are definitely city assets that are, you know, not a lot of people, a lot of people use them, but a lot of people just can't or don't know about it.

503
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:30,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So the continuity between them, physical and otherwise, and the kind of rebirth of the historic components of those cemeteries,

504
00:58:31,627 --> 00:58:36,030
[SPEAKER_04]: are something that has come before Ryan and myself on the commission a number of times.

505
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:46,676
[SPEAKER_04]: We're obviously actively working with both the inbound board and the cemetery board as well to try to move those pieces forward.

506
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:58,183
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, Roberta, you've emphasized the need for the master plan overlook on both properties, I think, to really make sure that what's being done fits into a larger story and context.

507
00:58:58,223 --> 00:59:01,105
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's been a positive move.

508
00:59:05,397 --> 00:59:22,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, just to continue on with that conversation, you know, the commission's big project right now, as you guys know, is Thomas Brooks Park and just staying focused on working through and following through with the master plan that CPC was generous enough to fund.

509
00:59:23,032 --> 00:59:30,718
[SPEAKER_10]: But I am currently working with the cemetery trustees to work on an assessment for

510
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:35,381
[SPEAKER_10]: cross street cemetery that will ultimately lead to its restoration.

511
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:49,050
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be a several year, several thousand dollar project that easily, as the consultant has told me, there's at least five years worth of restoration work that will take place over multiple years.

512
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:54,574
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, and that's, you know, just one cemetery of three cemeteries in the city of Medford.

513
00:59:54,674 --> 01:00:00,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Salem Street has been addressed before they receive work, but there's definitely ongoing maintenance there.

514
01:00:01,398 --> 01:00:10,668
[SPEAKER_10]: To keep up with the deterioration and weathering of headstones, and then we will have to turn our attention to the larger cemetery Oak Grove.

515
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:17,996
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's already pieces that are coming into place there as we talked about the master plan and getting a plan in place for that.

516
01:00:19,437 --> 01:00:29,679
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of other city buildings, you know, I think the Historical Commission and CPC has been a partner in preservation with almost every department in the city.

517
01:00:29,739 --> 01:00:33,880
[SPEAKER_10]: We funded and supported work on all the historic fire stations.

518
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:40,242
[SPEAKER_10]: There's the Curtis Tufts School, which is the oldest school in Medford that still is functioning as a school.

519
01:00:40,282 --> 01:00:42,142
[SPEAKER_10]: We supported preservation efforts there.

520
01:00:43,382 --> 01:00:45,903
[SPEAKER_10]: We are working with the Cemetery Department and

521
01:00:46,603 --> 01:00:49,505
[SPEAKER_10]: have kind of encouraged them to restore their buildings.

522
01:00:49,705 --> 01:00:54,769
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, City Hall will probably need some maintenance too in the future.

523
01:00:54,849 --> 01:01:05,217
[SPEAKER_10]: I could imagine, you know, they did a lot of work on the exterior of the building, but there were conversations about window restorations and I'm sure the building will need repointing, that sort of thing.

524
01:01:06,097 --> 01:01:11,681
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, and there are other buildings that in Medford, I'm sure that will be deserving of attention.

525
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:16,204
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, so I think that there's always going to be a need for preservation.

526
01:01:16,825 --> 01:01:28,574
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be a way to partner preservation funding with, say, if they decide to do a facade improvement program, that might be a good use of CPC funding to kind of partner.

527
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:38,222
[SPEAKER_10]: If, say, you wanted to do something with a consistent community look in Haines Square or several of the Medford's commercial districts, that might be a good use of.

528
01:01:38,982 --> 01:01:46,169
[SPEAKER_10]: CPC funding but otherwise just sticking to these smaller more focused projects might be the way to go for a while.

529
01:01:52,615 --> 01:01:53,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

530
01:01:55,518 --> 01:02:03,646
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll chime in here that I've started some initial conversations with our facilities director to highlight and or

531
01:02:04,268 --> 01:02:08,911
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring to light any projects that he has in mind in our historic buildings.

532
01:02:09,331 --> 01:02:13,014
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been unable to connect this week.

533
01:02:13,194 --> 01:02:21,740
[SPEAKER_01]: It's budget season at City Hall, so if anybody has been trying to get in touch with anybody and experiencing delay, that might be the reason why.

534
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:33,488
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know that there are a couple of projects at City Hall, namely the bathrooms, water fountains, as well as the windows that

535
01:02:33,999 --> 01:02:35,080
[SPEAKER_01]: that Ryan mentioned there.

536
01:02:35,982 --> 01:02:40,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Those have been highlighted as ones to perhaps attack in the near future.

537
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:44,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Does our clock work in the tower?

538
01:02:45,013 --> 01:02:50,400
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody was just talking to me about the internal clock management system.

539
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia, would you like to take that one?

540
01:02:52,881 --> 01:02:54,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I, so let me put it this way.

541
01:02:54,962 --> 01:02:56,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it does.

542
01:02:57,283 --> 01:03:03,687
[SPEAKER_06]: As I'm saying this out loud I realized that maybe I should check in with Paul I feel that he knows about the clock system.

543
01:03:04,167 --> 01:03:12,131
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have in the city hall clocks that are wired into an internal clock timer, and I believe that it's the same one that

544
01:03:13,672 --> 01:03:15,534
[SPEAKER_06]: that, you know, the one up there, right?

545
01:03:15,974 --> 01:03:27,185
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to flip a switch in the City Hall break room to stop the clocks and then you should turn it back on at the right time to set them.

546
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:36,794
[SPEAKER_06]: And I should just check in with him that he has thought about that because I only think about it because that was my first office in City Hall was that little room.

547
01:03:37,854 --> 01:03:42,877
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I was very aware not to flip that switch or I'd screw up all the clocks in the city.

548
01:03:45,379 --> 01:03:57,206
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that little clock thing goes viral because I think that would get a lot more, a lot more eyes on these meetings than we've ever had before.

549
01:03:57,246 --> 01:04:04,490
[SPEAKER_04]: This might be a loaded question, but I've had a lot of meetings in my day within eastern Massachusetts, within

550
01:04:05,104 --> 01:04:09,666
[SPEAKER_04]: buildings that are about the same vintage as the City Hall building that you're in now, Alicia.

551
01:04:10,426 --> 01:04:16,209
[SPEAKER_04]: And most of them have an annex or something because you guys must not have enough space.

552
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:19,751
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had to, if I'm, my instincts are correct.

553
01:04:20,451 --> 01:04:26,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't, is there any thought given to how to expand that building?

554
01:04:26,174 --> 01:04:30,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it certainly seems like it has needed it for most of my lifetime, if you want to be, if I'm going to be honest here.

555
01:04:32,299 --> 01:04:40,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've talked about a few things here and there, but honestly, since I've been in this role, we've been in pandemic mode.

556
01:04:40,885 --> 01:04:49,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been focusing more on expanding the staff and keeping the staff that we have before we talk about expanding the spaces.

557
01:04:49,992 --> 01:04:52,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels like expanding the space is a luxury.

558
01:04:53,654 --> 01:04:56,176
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that we talked about is,

559
01:04:57,969 --> 01:05:08,679
[SPEAKER_06]: In the plans for redeveloping the lots at City Hall, one of them is to build a parking garage between City Hall and I-93.

560
01:05:09,479 --> 01:05:24,192
[SPEAKER_06]: And if one did that, we've been talking about attaching a gym and putting some rec department space there, except that doesn't actually offload space from within City Hall, but it might also make sense for parking department space in there.

561
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:28,576
[SPEAKER_06]: if we had that kind of a building at that location.

562
01:05:30,698 --> 01:05:44,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I've floated some ideas around buying the little tiny building behind City Hall, but really I want to buy it, use it as temporary annex, and then knock it down and make it part of the redevelopment of those lots because it would make a nice square.

563
01:05:44,329 --> 01:05:45,310
[SPEAKER_04]: It would.

564
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:47,672
[SPEAKER_06]: But there hasn't been the money to do that.

565
01:05:48,392 --> 01:05:49,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but I think

566
01:05:49,634 --> 01:05:58,845
[SPEAKER_04]: What about a feasibility study to expand the existing building footprint and take it from a T-shaped building to a much bigger volume behind it?

567
01:05:59,105 --> 01:06:00,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you could easily do that.

568
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:06,061
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that that falls into the level of wishlist, that there are so many other things.

569
01:06:06,502 --> 01:06:16,909
[SPEAKER_06]: If we floated that before, so I will tell you that I go to meetings about rebuilding or building a new fire headquarters.

570
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:21,232
[SPEAKER_06]: We have an OPM and an architect, contrary to what people might be saying.

571
01:06:21,993 --> 01:06:23,854
[SPEAKER_06]: They exist and I've been meeting with them.

572
01:06:25,803 --> 01:06:29,646
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but like that needs to move forward and that is urgent.

573
01:06:30,007 --> 01:06:33,029
[SPEAKER_06]: The city needs a new high school, right?

574
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:37,893
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not so crowded in city hall that it's a serious problem.

575
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:42,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, there are people who are in shared spaces.

576
01:06:42,477 --> 01:06:49,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Amanda and Aditi are not laughing at me and they don't look like they're gonna string me up, but they're two of four planners that share an office.

577
01:06:50,383 --> 01:06:54,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I've offered that we could put dividers or cubes if that would help in there.

578
01:06:56,955 --> 01:07:00,757
[SPEAKER_06]: But is it crowded?

579
01:07:01,677 --> 01:07:02,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

580
01:07:02,337 --> 01:07:03,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it too crowded?

581
01:07:03,618 --> 01:07:09,660
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that people would say we actually need enough staff to do all the work before we want to complain about all we need.

582
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:12,761
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels right now like a building would be a luxury.

583
01:07:12,781 --> 01:07:15,342
[SPEAKER_06]: There are things that we need first.

584
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:23,405
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just going to say you could hire a lot of staff for the cost that you can build a building addition.

585
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:43,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the risk of a policy that is not on the table right now, the way some of our peers are handling staffing, crowding is allowing, is having swing space and hoteling and stuff, which honestly, a lot of I've heard, if you're hoteling, people don't love it.

586
01:07:44,002 --> 01:07:49,665
[SPEAKER_06]: They like having their own desk, but it is not unheard of.

587
01:07:52,966 --> 01:07:54,207
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we do in Somerville.

588
01:07:57,324 --> 01:08:00,347
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to ask two things.

589
01:08:02,929 --> 01:08:21,225
[SPEAKER_08]: To add to the list of potential projects related to city assets that we need improvements is archives, not to overlook the need to create a space that we can safely store all of the archives that are stuffed in the basement right now.

590
01:08:21,345 --> 01:08:23,647
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should we restore those

591
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:30,443
[SPEAKER_08]: pieces of paper, preserve those pieces of paper that we have a place to safely store them.

592
01:08:31,624 --> 01:08:37,047
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, I wonder whether the Hagner Center could fulfill any of those needs.

593
01:08:37,867 --> 01:08:43,351
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure whether the Hagner Center has any historic preservation potential as a building, but

594
01:08:45,879 --> 01:08:58,347
[SPEAKER_08]: whether it has enough space to either fulfill the need for an annex, an archive, or some other community need that we have right now.

595
01:08:59,027 --> 01:09:10,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have requested, somebody tell me, has there been a press release by our congressional delegation about earmarks recently?

596
01:09:10,094 --> 01:09:13,876
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I remember seeing a press release about earmark for Hegner.

597
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:14,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

598
01:09:16,247 --> 01:09:21,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the difficulty of being in my job is knowing what is public news and what isn't.

599
01:09:21,849 --> 01:09:32,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had requested an earmark from the federal government to use the Hagner Center as a recreation location

600
01:09:32,612 --> 01:09:37,597
[SPEAKER_06]: for after school programming and recreation office space for the city of Medford.

601
01:09:38,878 --> 01:09:40,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is what we're looking at.

602
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:42,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I theory.

603
01:09:43,563 --> 01:09:45,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to look at whether that's a historic building.

604
01:09:48,868 --> 01:09:55,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Historically, it was the field house for a football stadium, for a football field that doesn't exist.

605
01:09:55,632 --> 01:09:59,073
[SPEAKER_06]: It was then used as a residential center and school.

606
01:09:59,514 --> 01:10:06,037
[SPEAKER_06]: So it doesn't look at all the way it did when it was originally built as the field house.

607
01:10:06,657 --> 01:10:18,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, that property, if we could take that and read to rebuild that as a, like a totally new larger building so it's two floors, and it's not accessible.

608
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:21,961
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no lift to the second floor.

609
01:10:23,101 --> 01:10:24,282
[SPEAKER_06]: So if, if I had.

610
01:10:26,107 --> 01:10:43,715
[SPEAKER_06]: $10 million and not the $850,000 we requested in the earmark, I would knock that building down and build like a four-story building there, fully accessible, that we could really use for some of these public spaces and recreation space.

611
01:10:44,355 --> 01:10:48,417
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need a resilience hub, like a location for

612
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:52,748
[SPEAKER_06]: social services and stuff.

613
01:10:54,068 --> 01:10:54,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be lovely.

614
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:56,750
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one house on the corner there.

615
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:08,234
[SPEAKER_06]: If that gentleman would like to sell to us at some point or will that property to the city, that would be amazing because that would give us like that whole corner because it butts up against Gillis.

616
01:11:08,294 --> 01:11:09,915
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have a big imagination.

617
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:15,337
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's partially and I think Ryan popped something into the chat about the

618
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,763
[SPEAKER_06]: They've determined it is they've already determined it was significant for CPC.

619
01:11:21,104 --> 01:11:27,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's kind of what I was like, I see really, I don't want to invest historic money into this building.

620
01:11:27,729 --> 01:11:31,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's so much more long term potential in this location.

621
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:33,390
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think your vision is good.

622
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:41,272
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, you know, this is the type of thing that we can say, you know, we're prioritizing preservation at other areas, so you can document it.

623
01:11:41,392 --> 01:11:42,712
[SPEAKER_10]: It'll be available for study.

624
01:11:42,812 --> 01:11:48,993
[SPEAKER_10]: We knew what it was, and now you have this bigger building and more functional use of the site.

625
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:50,593
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very much behind that.

626
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:53,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, significance doesn't mean it's off-limits.

627
01:11:53,494 --> 01:11:54,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something we needed.

628
01:11:55,114 --> 01:11:58,675
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done plenty of significant buildings that we just did exactly what Ryan said.

629
01:11:59,457 --> 01:12:04,759
[SPEAKER_04]: That should not be a hurdle to any planning you might be thinking of there.

630
01:12:04,839 --> 01:12:15,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had members of the public ask me if they should try and get it designated so they could apply for CPC money to restore that building so they could use it for like childcare.

631
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:20,223
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, if we're serious about using this building for childcare, we want it a lot bigger.

632
01:12:20,943 --> 01:12:26,065
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want our hands tied by having used historic money on it.

633
01:12:27,668 --> 01:12:28,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with that.

634
01:12:28,749 --> 01:12:30,430
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too small and too inefficient.

635
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,892
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't get enough kids in there to make it meaningful.

636
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:33,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

637
01:12:34,233 --> 01:12:40,878
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, if we can do a renovation and open up after school programming in the short run, we need that.

638
01:12:41,438 --> 01:12:48,443
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the long run, we should be looking for $10 or $20 million to really do something real there.

639
01:12:50,938 --> 01:13:02,063
[SPEAKER_08]: These other needs that we're talking about, the need for a childcare space, recreation space, for archives, maybe some city offices, I don't know.

640
01:13:02,483 --> 01:13:10,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder whether any of those needs could be met in a new high school building or a new fire station for that matter.

641
01:13:10,566 --> 01:13:19,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Could we stuff a little bit of extra room into any of those new buildings to fulfill any of these other community needs?

642
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:27,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so while I love that, and I wish, the difficulty is the cost per square foot of buildings.

643
01:13:29,032 --> 01:13:35,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And as they started working on the fire station, what happened was they had, here's what we'd love to have, here's the stuff.

644
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:38,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what are those square foots?

645
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And Doug could probably explain this process better than I can.

646
01:13:41,226 --> 01:13:57,186
[SPEAKER_06]: But in layman's terms, you know, what are the what is the program, what do we need with a square foot, and then they put a number in front of the mayor, and then she went, we can't we can't bond for that we can't afford that, along with doing a new high school, we need to trim back.

647
01:13:57,646 --> 01:13:59,987
[SPEAKER_06]: to what do we need in a fire headquarters?

648
01:14:00,407 --> 01:14:12,392
[SPEAKER_06]: So the most recent iteration I saw had space that was actually designated as future building expansion space in the event that the city needed more space and had the funding, right?

649
01:14:12,432 --> 01:14:15,834
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like two stories, it was like two and a half stories.

650
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:18,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess there's this weird mezzanine because you need a high.

651
01:14:18,515 --> 01:14:24,778
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like, but the second story didn't go out the whole of the first story because it's more expensive to build that.

652
01:14:25,498 --> 01:14:29,405
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but it was designed so that you could then go out and build more.

653
01:14:32,161 --> 01:14:43,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you work, so that's sort of like the, we already had a heart attack at the price there, and so we're kind of designing what we can, but expandable.

654
01:14:43,944 --> 01:15:01,448
[SPEAKER_06]: The high school, I haven't gotten into the weeds yet, and I'm afraid I'm gonna, but my understanding with MSBA, the Master School Building Authority, which is a big funder, is that they have formulas about square footage per student, and how big they think your building needs to be.

655
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:13,697
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the city of Medford is going to be extremely sad when they see what the square footage per student is and what that means for our extremely massive high school.

656
01:15:14,798 --> 01:15:24,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may actually be a reason why we might convince the community that we want to actually gut renovate rather than knock down and rebuild.

657
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:29,269
[SPEAKER_06]: If we got renovated, I would argue that there could be space for stuff.

658
01:15:29,289 --> 01:15:38,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now we have the all school administration, all the superintendents and stuff, central finance for the schools, central facilities.

659
01:15:39,219 --> 01:15:45,545
[SPEAKER_06]: They even have a facility shop in the back where like the mechanics have a workshop, right?

660
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:49,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that all is built into that existing building.

661
01:15:49,749 --> 01:15:55,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are some underutilized spaces in that building that perhaps could be better utilized.

662
01:15:56,351 --> 01:16:05,454
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some massive old water tanks for the heating system that we couldn't afford to cut up into little pieces and carry out, so they're still there.

663
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:09,256
[SPEAKER_06]: But in a gut renovation, you'd take that stuff out and reclaim the space.

664
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:19,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So there might, it might actually be rational if we were to move forward in that direction rather than a ground up new building.

665
01:16:21,001 --> 01:16:24,582
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm, this is very early stages.

666
01:16:25,463 --> 01:16:25,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Understood.

667
01:16:27,164 --> 01:16:28,944
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a quick question on the school.

668
01:16:29,064 --> 01:16:30,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So not to get distracted.

669
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:36,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you saying that the square footage for student would mean that the high school would get smaller because we don't have as many students?

670
01:16:37,989 --> 01:16:45,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and it's the formulas how they did it back when they built this building in 68 69 is different.

671
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,365
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it was designed for 4000 students.

672
01:16:48,385 --> 01:16:48,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

673
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:56,134
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have massive, I am told that our vocational shops are massive compared to other schools.

674
01:16:56,535 --> 01:17:07,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not personally toured them, but I've had people from other school systems tell me that we should be prepared for what actually MSBA thinks we need.

675
01:17:08,346 --> 01:17:12,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it possible that half of that building could become an annex for other uses?

676
01:17:14,624 --> 01:17:15,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

677
01:17:15,044 --> 01:17:20,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I wonder if there's, so we've talked about putting recreation up there, you know, if there was the space.

678
01:17:20,945 --> 01:17:21,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

679
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:34,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Or closing some of the, like, you know, the logical would tell you to close the Curtis tough school, the oldest building in the system and move them up to the high school and give them their own separate building wing.

680
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:35,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

681
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:44,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And then that would allow, then that would allow the city to take over the Curtis tough school as a annex right next to the park and rec or rec.

682
01:17:45,071 --> 01:17:47,894
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it'd be like shuffling schools around like they did in 2000 and 2001.

683
01:17:47,934 --> 01:17:48,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

684
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:51,897
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an interesting question.

685
01:17:51,937 --> 01:17:52,878
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder if it's possible.

686
01:17:52,898 --> 01:17:56,721
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Curtis Tufts is an alternative high school and it's for

687
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:08,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Students who are not function, I'm not exactly sure the terminology, but it's not like you're special needs, you're developmentally disabled.

688
01:18:08,209 --> 01:18:09,010
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that.

689
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:14,891
[SPEAKER_06]: It's you're like, you are a danger or you can't function.

690
01:18:15,152 --> 01:18:19,713
[SPEAKER_06]: You have such high anxiety, you can't function in a large school environment.

691
01:18:21,093 --> 01:18:24,114
[SPEAKER_06]: It's for kids who need something different.

692
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:26,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't,

693
01:18:27,018 --> 01:18:30,040
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past, they used to have girls who were pregnant go there.

694
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:42,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that that's something they still do today, but it actually allowed like for dramatic more flexibility around now you're not pregnant, but you have a baby and you can bring your baby to class.

695
01:18:42,888 --> 01:18:46,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very small kind of school kind of concept.

696
01:18:47,051 --> 01:18:54,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's still happening, but you could imagine that if somebody was carrying their baby around Medford High, that would become like,

697
01:18:55,776 --> 01:18:58,738
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such a stressful situation for everybody.

698
01:18:59,138 --> 01:19:03,522
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there would need to be a well thought out plan as to how the logistics of that would work.

699
01:19:03,582 --> 01:19:04,202
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, yes.

700
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:05,883
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I totally understand.

701
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:15,870
[SPEAKER_10]: I also do think that if we're pouring money into our school system, we might as well give all of the students equal treatment.

702
01:19:17,291 --> 01:19:24,857
[SPEAKER_06]: And that building got all new LED lights in 2016 or 17, give or take, the Curtis Tufts did.

703
01:19:26,317 --> 01:19:28,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got a grant for that.

704
01:19:28,318 --> 01:19:31,120
[SPEAKER_08]: But it could use a facelift on its cupola.

705
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know what condition the roof is.

706
01:19:34,222 --> 01:19:36,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Or even the interior.

707
01:19:36,363 --> 01:19:43,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Having gone through and traveled all the original schools, I could imagine what the condition of the interior looks like.

708
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:50,232
[SPEAKER_06]: It got an HVAC upgrade too, because it was oil until somewhere in the 2000s.

709
01:19:50,472 --> 01:19:55,554
[SPEAKER_06]: It got a natural gas heating system and there's a computer room in there.

710
01:19:56,114 --> 01:19:57,635
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better than you would think.

711
01:19:58,508 --> 01:20:05,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean, Medford must have, I guess this is just a good question, and maybe this is the thing that the city should fund.

712
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:09,851
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford must have a facilities assessment of all of their city-owned buildings, right?

713
01:20:09,891 --> 01:20:13,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And if not, that might be something that they consider getting, right?

714
01:20:13,672 --> 01:20:16,253
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, I worked with the town of Watertown.

715
01:20:16,313 --> 01:20:17,953
[SPEAKER_10]: They just took all of their buildings.

716
01:20:17,993 --> 01:20:21,474
[SPEAKER_10]: We assessed them one by one, and they had a life cycle.

717
01:20:21,534 --> 01:20:23,475
[SPEAKER_10]: They talked about what they needed over 10 years.

718
01:20:25,155 --> 01:20:30,537
[SPEAKER_10]: then the city went forth and started to apply for funding and the taxpayers knew what they needed to get.

719
01:20:30,557 --> 01:20:35,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to know what the assessment costs so we can start budgeting for it.

720
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,601
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing it more as needed, right?

721
01:20:39,641 --> 01:20:45,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the fire stations had a level of assessment done so we could do the upgrades that we knew we needed there.

722
01:20:46,085 --> 01:20:48,967
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I could imagine there's probably different pieces already there.

723
01:20:49,007 --> 01:20:54,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I could imagine the schools had one, you know, the fire stations have another, the police has a brand new building.

724
01:20:54,672 --> 01:20:56,953
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's got one, you know, that sort of thing.

725
01:20:57,073 --> 01:20:58,414
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah.

726
01:21:00,176 --> 01:21:10,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I really appreciate seeing the big picture, knowing how the specific requests that we receive fit into what the overall needs are.

727
01:21:10,884 --> 01:21:11,324
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um,

728
01:21:12,629 --> 01:21:13,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I second that.

729
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:26,514
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's also why we're looking at master planning for the Brooks and for the Oak Grove Cemetery, just so that we understand what is the priority of the thing that we're being asked for.

730
01:21:33,697 --> 01:21:41,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions, comments with respect to historic preservation or any of the program areas?

731
01:21:44,046 --> 01:21:55,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the application process and the observations from those of you who have participated in the application process about how that works.

732
01:21:57,905 --> 01:22:10,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I think for application process, I do it myself, but I think it would be super helpful to have a document that you can fill out ahead of time and then just copy and paste into Smartsheets.

733
01:22:11,616 --> 01:22:20,483
[SPEAKER_10]: I made one, but it might be nice just to make a PDF of your Smartsheets just so people can copy and paste that ahead of time so they know what questions they're answering.

734
01:22:20,503 --> 01:22:23,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's no way to save the application.

735
01:22:23,486 --> 01:22:26,448
[SPEAKER_10]: So having that would be super helpful.

736
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:28,403
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.

737
01:22:28,803 --> 01:22:29,384
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll happen.

738
01:22:30,224 --> 01:22:30,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Ryan.

739
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:46,601
[SPEAKER_05]: This might be a. I think in previous years, the CPC has taken different approaches to sort of some distinct feedback and also.

740
01:22:47,953 --> 01:22:57,243
[SPEAKER_05]: the setting up conversations with various entities to get ready ahead of the application period.

741
01:22:57,703 --> 01:23:08,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I wonder if it would make sense this year, we have like a monthly internal parks updates meeting where we convene a lot of the department

742
01:23:09,349 --> 01:23:34,665
[SPEAKER_05]: um, heads and staff that work on parks projects to discuss, and maybe it's a matter of, um, I just feel like it could be good if, whether it's Teresa or Roberta, um, if we, like, had a conversation maybe with, um, with that staff as an opportunity to sort of hear, like, ahead of or right around the application period, you know, what, what are people thinking?

743
01:23:34,685 --> 01:23:38,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it might be an opportunity to sort of vet stuff and also check

744
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:49,665
[SPEAKER_05]: in on what else the committee, from where else the committee has heard so that the city can get an understanding of how to prioritize their applications.

745
01:23:50,305 --> 01:23:50,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a thought.

746
01:23:52,546 --> 01:23:53,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, that's a great thought.

747
01:23:53,567 --> 01:24:04,171
[SPEAKER_01]: I do attend those meetings, but I like the idea of like formally just instead of being passive on it being like CPA applications coming up.

748
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:07,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely, I'll add that in on my

749
01:24:08,945 --> 01:24:09,325
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule.

750
01:24:11,627 --> 01:24:13,608
[SPEAKER_08]: And since the I'm sorry.

751
01:24:13,628 --> 01:24:17,850
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, you know, I never mind.

752
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:34,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also going to just to mention that this year will hold an info session for folks like yes, we're talking to to folks that have repeatedly applied for CPA funding, but

753
01:24:35,224 --> 01:24:43,477
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to open it up for everybody, so there will be an info session just to talk a little bit more about the program, help folks with application questions that they may have this year.

754
01:24:57,907 --> 01:25:00,549
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, thank you to all of you.

755
01:25:00,569 --> 01:25:19,145
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a great discussion and really helpful to learn more about what's going on and talk about kind of what it is that we need to keep in mind as we consider funding possibilities for this year.

756
01:25:23,887 --> 01:25:27,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Any last thoughts or comments before we close the public hearing?

757
01:25:29,248 --> 01:25:35,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that I hit the link for the parks Excel spreadsheet that was posted earlier.

758
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:37,270
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's exactly what I was looking for.

759
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:38,611
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great document.

760
01:25:38,631 --> 01:25:40,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't know it existed.

761
01:25:40,311 --> 01:25:41,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad I saw it.

762
01:25:41,212 --> 01:25:46,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really answers all my questions about the context of all the projects going on in the city.

763
01:25:47,928 --> 01:25:52,789
[SPEAKER_04]: only a fraction of them are funded by CPA, CPC, but it's good to see the context.

764
01:25:52,809 --> 01:25:53,930
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what I was looking for.

765
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:54,690
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for that.

766
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:59,611
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure that it can feel like you must be funding everything in the city.

767
01:25:59,631 --> 01:26:06,633
[SPEAKER_06]: The reality is the amount of things we're moving forward are just insane.

768
01:26:07,213 --> 01:26:10,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we can't put press releases out about everything we do.

769
01:26:10,054 --> 01:26:10,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

770
01:26:11,655 --> 01:26:12,675
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's an impressive list.

771
01:26:15,482 --> 01:26:21,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And we would love to do more ourselves to talk about what we're doing.

772
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:28,011
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, thank you for helping us get the message out.

773
01:26:33,975 --> 01:26:37,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need a motion to close the public hearing?

774
01:26:37,697 --> 01:26:38,398
[SPEAKER_08]: I think so.

775
01:26:38,458 --> 01:26:39,718
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the way it works.

776
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:41,660
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not the expert though.

777
01:26:47,311 --> 01:26:47,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Removed.

778
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:50,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I think I heard.

779
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:50,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Seconded.

780
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:54,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Reg first with Ari second.

781
01:26:55,634 --> 01:26:56,034
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

782
01:26:56,154 --> 01:26:57,635
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I will call the roll.

783
01:26:57,655 --> 01:26:59,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug?

784
01:27:00,516 --> 01:27:00,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

785
01:27:01,656 --> 01:27:01,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Ari?

786
01:27:02,977 --> 01:27:03,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

787
01:27:03,897 --> 01:27:04,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Craig?

788
01:27:04,897 --> 01:27:05,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

789
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:06,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Reg?

790
01:27:09,639 --> 01:27:09,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

791
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:11,760
[SPEAKER_08]: And myself, yes.

792
01:27:13,588 --> 01:27:15,611
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much to everyone.

793
01:27:15,631 --> 01:27:19,577
[SPEAKER_08]: And that concludes our public hearing, but we do still have one item.

794
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:38,596
[SPEAKER_08]: to cover on the agenda, which is when we recommended funding for Duggar, the tennis courts for the, there was an, yeah, the back wall for the courts.

795
01:27:38,616 --> 01:27:41,217
[SPEAKER_08]: We added on $2,000 to make sure that there was a,

796
01:27:46,458 --> 01:27:55,844
[SPEAKER_08]: a memorial signage that memorialized Clarence Roan, for whom the tennis courts are named.

797
01:27:56,925 --> 01:28:04,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And as it turns out, I was really late to the game because there's already a memorial to honor Clarence Roan.

798
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:10,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So Teresa, do you want to share with us?

799
01:28:11,234 --> 01:28:11,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

800
01:28:13,495 --> 01:28:17,496
[SPEAKER_01]: it was, again, a condition of the Bounce Back Wall award.

801
01:28:18,016 --> 01:28:25,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ideas here are, since the condition was to put in this plaque that's already preexisting, we could, here are our options.

802
01:28:25,599 --> 01:28:32,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Options three, the first one is, we could put up an updated plaque for Clarence Rhone.

803
01:28:32,761 --> 01:28:34,882
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that's there, I believe, was placed in the 70s.

804
01:28:35,642 --> 01:28:38,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Still very lovely, but we could do a secondary one.

805
01:28:38,703 --> 01:28:39,443
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's option one.

806
01:28:40,242 --> 01:28:44,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Option two would be to return the funds back into the CPA coffers.

807
01:28:44,583 --> 01:28:45,623
[SPEAKER_01]: This is estimated about $2,000.

808
01:28:46,043 --> 01:28:51,405
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would come back into our reserves to be able to be used on another project.

809
01:28:52,305 --> 01:29:03,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Or options three would be to actually put up a plaque for Lieutenant Colonel Edward Dugger, who the park is named after.

810
01:29:03,507 --> 01:29:06,748
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first African-American

811
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,421
[SPEAKER_01]: To have a park named after him.

812
01:29:09,441 --> 01:29:11,243
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in the state of Massachusetts.

813
01:29:11,843 --> 01:29:16,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe it was the Yeah, in the state of Massachusetts.

814
01:29:17,929 --> 01:29:27,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Local Very prominent and I believe he was born in like 1924 served overseas and World War One to World War Two.

815
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:29,921
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, options to

816
01:29:31,122 --> 01:29:46,931
[SPEAKER_01]: of button this one up is we could they could still proceed with putting a plaque in for Clarence Roan just it would be secondary to the existing we could return the money to the coffers or options three would be to commemorate another prominent member of the West Medford history.

817
01:29:48,391 --> 01:30:00,418
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point PDS has no preference really what it made most sense from our conversations perhaps to to think of a new placard for

818
01:30:01,058 --> 01:30:07,559
[SPEAKER_01]: and Colonel Edward Duggar, but I will open it up to the committee to see if anybody has any strong opinions either way.

819
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:12,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel strongly that it should not be one.

820
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel good about either two or three.

821
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:16,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I would agree with that.

822
01:30:17,721 --> 01:30:18,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Figured that would be an easy one.

823
01:30:18,861 --> 01:30:21,622
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Roberta?

824
01:30:21,642 --> 01:30:24,882
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't raise my hand for some reason.

825
01:30:24,902 --> 01:30:26,483
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can hear you, Reg, which is great.

826
01:30:27,183 --> 01:30:27,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh.

827
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:42,109
[SPEAKER_12]: I, the, uh, the existing memorial for, um, Mr. Rome, uh, is outside of the, outside of the, uh, actual tennis court.

828
01:30:42,949 --> 01:30:46,292
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it's primarily facing the tennis court.

829
01:30:47,313 --> 01:30:49,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it's an, it's in an awkward position right now.

830
01:30:50,595 --> 01:30:55,079
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I don't know that the wording could be updated or anything of that nature.

831
01:30:55,539 --> 01:30:56,640
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not really sure that.

832
01:30:57,101 --> 01:31:01,386
[SPEAKER_12]: anything's changed since the original memorial was put up.

833
01:31:02,927 --> 01:31:13,478
[SPEAKER_12]: In regards to the memorial for Colonel Duggar, I do believe that if you look over there by the bridge, the top of the bridge, there's a memorial for Colonel Duggar.

834
01:31:14,099 --> 01:31:14,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is there?

835
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:20,125
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll have to check it again tomorrow morning, but I believe, I mean, when I was a kid, there was a memorial there.

836
01:31:20,946 --> 01:31:26,268
[SPEAKER_12]: on a rock for, excuse me, a stone for Colonel Duggar.

837
01:31:26,328 --> 01:31:32,171
[SPEAKER_12]: So that might not be something that's appropriate to put up a second one.

838
01:31:32,791 --> 01:31:33,752
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not really sure.

839
01:31:35,873 --> 01:31:44,976
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you were talking about the tennis buyback or playback or whatever you call it.

840
01:31:45,677 --> 01:31:46,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Bounce back.

841
01:31:46,859 --> 01:31:50,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Bounce back, okay.

842
01:31:50,561 --> 01:31:58,985
[SPEAKER_12]: That might be something that would be more appropriate for that particular space.

843
01:32:02,267 --> 01:32:12,852
[SPEAKER_12]: I just think that that'd probably be a better use of our funds than memorializing something that's already there, to be honest with you.

844
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:20,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, just to clarify, and my mistake for not clarifying this, the award was for the bounce back.

845
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:30,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was just a condition that that here's here's the funding for the bounce back well but you also must use a portion of this funding to put in a plaque.

846
01:32:32,597 --> 01:32:34,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And we added to the budget.

847
01:32:34,378 --> 01:32:45,801
[SPEAKER_08]: So the funding was requested for the bounce back wall and we awarded that plus $2,000 to be able to add the sign.

848
01:32:47,702 --> 01:32:49,703
[SPEAKER_12]: So how big does the sign have to be?

849
01:32:51,223 --> 01:32:52,664
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't put parameters on it.

850
01:32:53,884 --> 01:32:58,525
[SPEAKER_08]: But we wanted it to be enough to actually design a nice sign and not just

851
01:33:01,832 --> 01:33:08,396
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a metal stuck into a rock plaque.

852
01:33:08,596 --> 01:33:27,969
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I would add to pick up on what Reggie said is that, and Ryan as well, we've discovered in the course of the Thomas Brooks Park project and others, that many of the plaques around Medford are actually historically inaccurate and need updating and correction on the historical record.

853
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:32,632
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if that's the case for Colonel Douglas Black.

854
01:33:33,453 --> 01:33:36,834
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a World War I veteran, commander.

855
01:33:37,995 --> 01:33:40,156
[SPEAKER_12]: World War I didn't start in 1926.

856
01:33:40,676 --> 01:33:43,878
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I think he was born in 1924.

857
01:33:44,038 --> 01:33:45,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I think- I had the numbers wrong.

858
01:33:45,639 --> 01:33:47,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to memorize them, Doug, I'm sorry.

859
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:56,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, there's like 50 Blacks in the city, so you're going to have to be Rain Man to make that happen, young lady, but that's fine.

860
01:33:56,901 --> 01:34:03,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we should look at what we've got first and just see if there's a way to improve or something that might be wrong that we can improve on it.

861
01:34:03,744 --> 01:34:09,106
[SPEAKER_04]: We can, I don't know if we need to figure it out right now, but I think we need to do a little bit of research of the context myself.

862
01:34:10,206 --> 01:34:22,371
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just put forward that if, if there's placards for, for both people there and they're both relatively accurate, I'd be a proponent of returning that funding to be used elsewhere.

863
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:28,804
[SPEAKER_11]: for things that we don't yet have, if what's out there is relatively accurate to start.

864
01:34:32,427 --> 01:34:33,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Alicia.

865
01:34:33,928 --> 01:34:37,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you have something or you just wanted to say that you're leaving?

866
01:34:37,771 --> 01:34:40,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, bye.

867
01:34:42,495 --> 01:34:44,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I would agree with all of you that we've

868
01:34:47,722 --> 01:34:52,143
[SPEAKER_08]: probably it would be probably the most appropriate to put the funding back.

869
01:34:52,623 --> 01:34:56,784
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just wanted to weigh in with respect to the signs.

870
01:34:59,705 --> 01:35:08,247
[SPEAKER_08]: The thinking was that the, so signage is not a standalone project for CPA.

871
01:35:08,787 --> 01:35:17,289
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be, we can use CPA funds to make appropriate signage for a project that's all

872
01:35:17,849 --> 01:35:20,130
[SPEAKER_08]: that is an eligible project.

873
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:33,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So building the tennis courts or adding this last feature to the tennis courts or any other playground improvement or building improvement for that matter is an eligible project.

874
01:35:33,793 --> 01:35:37,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We can add signage to that where appropriate.

875
01:35:37,054 --> 01:35:37,094
[SPEAKER_08]: So

876
01:35:39,932 --> 01:35:51,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Even using that $2,000 to commemorate somebody who's not associated with the tennis courts themselves, I'm not sure that I would have been comfortable with that solution.

877
01:35:51,939 --> 01:36:05,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to fund another playground, whether it's Duggar or another playground, and commemorate a person who's associated with the history of that site.

878
01:36:08,841 --> 01:36:16,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was the thinking behind adding the funds for the sign in the first place.

879
01:36:18,029 --> 01:36:24,475
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Roberta, the actual tennis courts of themselves don't have a sign.

880
01:36:24,535 --> 01:36:27,858
[SPEAKER_12]: They always did have a sign that indicated that it was

881
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:30,896
[SPEAKER_12]: the Clarence Rhone tennis courts.

882
01:36:32,296 --> 01:36:45,540
[SPEAKER_12]: It had been memorialized at that point, but since the new fencing and resurfacing and so on and so forth, there is no sign indicating that that specific tennis court is memorialized for.

883
01:36:47,161 --> 01:36:47,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

884
01:36:47,521 --> 01:36:50,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

885
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:54,023
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe what's missing is just

886
01:36:57,453 --> 01:37:05,495
[SPEAKER_08]: So we already have this nice plaque.

887
01:37:06,515 --> 01:37:07,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think you're right.

888
01:37:08,035 --> 01:37:12,377
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need to duplicate the plaque in the stone, the memorial.

889
01:37:12,757 --> 01:37:24,520
[SPEAKER_08]: But we could just have an aluminum dibond sign on the fence of the tennis court that says it's Clarence Roan Tennis Court.

890
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:34,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we don't, that can probably be accomplished in less than $50, I imagine.

891
01:37:34,984 --> 01:37:38,707
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we can put the rest of the money back in.

892
01:37:40,007 --> 01:37:40,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

893
01:37:42,349 --> 01:37:51,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless we want to design something nicer than just the words Clarence Roan Tennis Court, since Doug made that face.

894
01:37:51,254 --> 01:37:53,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a designer, nor

895
01:37:56,247 --> 01:37:58,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a lot of experience pricing things like this?

896
01:37:59,249 --> 01:38:03,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think your $50 might be a little low, but you're on the right track.

897
01:38:06,855 --> 01:38:14,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, for those of you who don't know Mr. Rome, he was a pretty fascinating individual.

898
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:23,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Back in my time, there were two clay courts down at Duggar Park.

899
01:38:26,453 --> 01:38:32,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Rome was there just about every day, giving anybody who needed to a lesson.

900
01:38:33,495 --> 01:38:41,338
[SPEAKER_12]: So a lot of young kids and some not so young kids got tennis lessons from him, gratis.

901
01:38:42,398 --> 01:38:54,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And like the pickleball folks that are using the Tenex foot now, it was a social gathering, if you will,

902
01:38:56,625 --> 01:39:00,348
[SPEAKER_12]: brought everybody in the neighborhood together that wanted to play tennis.

903
01:39:04,051 --> 01:39:04,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.

904
01:39:04,952 --> 01:39:05,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

905
01:39:07,474 --> 01:39:12,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, by the way, his great grandson still lives across the street.

906
01:39:13,259 --> 01:39:14,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's wonderful.

907
01:39:16,842 --> 01:39:17,222
[SPEAKER_08]: I love it.

908
01:39:18,788 --> 01:39:29,556
[SPEAKER_08]: So Teresa, I don't know if you're able to arrange for that design of a sign that just simply says Clarence Rowan Tennis Courts.

909
01:39:30,997 --> 01:39:32,958
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I can work with Amanda on that one.

910
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:34,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.

911
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:37,141
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to take a motion on that, right?

912
01:39:37,401 --> 01:39:39,503
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still fulfilling the condition.

913
01:39:39,563 --> 01:39:39,983
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sign.

914
01:39:40,918 --> 01:39:42,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think so.

915
01:39:42,258 --> 01:39:48,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, yeah, so we'll have a sign, we'll use the money for the sign, and then you just return all the unspent funds and we don't need a motion.

916
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.

917
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, everybody.

918
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:51,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.

919
01:39:52,520 --> 01:39:52,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

920
01:39:54,401 --> 01:39:56,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that cover the remainder of our agenda?

921
01:39:57,001 --> 01:39:57,401
