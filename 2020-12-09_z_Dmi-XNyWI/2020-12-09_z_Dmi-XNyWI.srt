1
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:17,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Marisa's on a call.

2
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:23,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, we can wait a minute.

3
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:24,039
[SPEAKER_01]: What should be done soon?

4
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:24,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know?

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,660
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's playing.

6
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:26,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

7
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:27,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure.

8
00:00:27,082 --> 00:00:37,950
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent her the document yesterday, so I don't imagine that'd be that much to really talk about today.

9
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:39,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully.

10
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:47,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, how are you?

11
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:53,648
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't put a tie on for us, I hope.

12
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:57,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I didn't even get my suit jacket out.

13
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:13,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello Melanie, how are you?

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,064
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good, I was just thinking I have an action item or two to get you and I was I saw you and I'm like oh I gotta get Tom these action items.

15
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:28,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay I'm here, we'll stay in touch so whenever you get the chance.

16
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:30,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I will, thank you.

17
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:35,392
[SPEAKER_05]: How's your, let's be some excitement soon about the return for your son and

18
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:37,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Very exciting.

19
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:45,920
[SPEAKER_04]: He's returning next Monday, but also we just got two acceptance letters to college, a merit scholarship, and an honor roll.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,863
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're happy campers this week.

21
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:49,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Which colleges?

22
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Regis and Framingham State, but they're all, he's playing, you know, so they're recruiting him for soccer.

23
00:01:55,591 --> 00:02:00,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's got six more in the pipeline that are calling pretty much every day the coaches are.

24
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:06,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're, we're all about those scholarships.

25
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:06,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for him.

26
00:02:07,814 --> 00:02:08,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

27
00:02:08,934 --> 00:02:09,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Exciting.

28
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:14,596
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was getting recruited without his senior season really under his belt too.

29
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:16,396
[SPEAKER_05]: So he must've had a decent,

30
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:20,926
[SPEAKER_05]: track record from his junior year or club or things like that, beyond that.

31
00:02:20,986 --> 00:02:22,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he does club and he does clinics.

32
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:26,970
[SPEAKER_04]: They come out to the clinics and scout them a lot.

33
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,471
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's been doing that.

34
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:32,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really happy that he's going either D2 or D3.

35
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:33,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't want him to do D1.

36
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,955
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just too much of a sacrifice.

37
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:37,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And college is an adjustment enough.

38
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:44,762
[SPEAKER_04]: So this way we get the benefit of a cohort and the ability to play without necessarily the grueling rigor of a D1.

39
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:52,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good, but it's another baby flying the nest, so always hard.

40
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

41
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:53,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

42
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:57,399
[SPEAKER_01]: That is exciting.

43
00:02:57,699 --> 00:02:58,279
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:11,505
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we should get started, just because I believe there's another METPR community media access that starts right after our meeting, so we want to make sure to be done on time.

45
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:15,127
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I should move the agenda.

46
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:15,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

47
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:22,746
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so it is 4.03.

48
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:30,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to call to order the Rules, Policy and Equity Subcommittee meeting for today, which is December 9th, 2020.

49
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:36,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be advised that on Wednesday, November 9th, from 4 p.m.

[SPEAKER_01]: The agenda for tonight is one item.

65
00:05:50,158 --> 00:05:59,824
[SPEAKER_01]: Our meeting objective is to continue to work on the school calendar 2021-2022 with specific attention paid to observations of holidays.

66
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I will take the attendance.

67
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:04,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Graham.

68
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:04,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

69
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:05,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Member McLaughlin.

70
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:05,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

71
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:13,045
[SPEAKER_01]: and a member or so present, three present.

72
00:06:13,905 --> 00:06:14,566
[SPEAKER_01]: We have quorum.

73
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:26,434
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did send out a link to, I took the existing policy and I wordsmithed it into a more modern format.

74
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:30,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect the old one was not, Google Docs probably didn't exist when it was written.

75
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:35,180
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna just share it since not everybody necessarily has that.

76
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,521
[SPEAKER_01]: If that sounds okay with the members.

77
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Peter, can I ask if you wouldn't mind muting?

78
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:47,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

79
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:49,872
[SPEAKER_01]: share screen.

80
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:05,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this too big on everybody's screen?

81
00:07:05,278 --> 00:07:06,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Or does zoom make magic?

82
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:25,389
[SPEAKER_01]: see it okay good so um this just follows this is the uh proposed new policy um it is we have an existing policy um which i will include in our packets um which is the icica policy um

83
00:07:26,468 --> 00:07:28,550
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually forget how they give IDs.

84
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:31,332
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the existing policy.

85
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:38,157
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an update using the format that we have started using the last couple of years.

86
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,722
[SPEAKER_01]: The name of the policy is the school year, school calendar policy.

87
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:44,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't actually make that up.

88
00:07:45,904 --> 00:07:55,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So the purpose aims to provide as much planning time for our students, families, and staff, and to ensure compliance with legally mandated

89
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,137
[SPEAKER_01]: structured learning time.

90
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:05,884
[SPEAKER_01]: This section here, unless anybody wants me to, it is pretty much the same text.

91
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:10,948
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the same text as the old policy, except for the inclusion of that.

92
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:17,953
[SPEAKER_01]: We will do it in November, which we actually previously approved at the school committee meeting, if memory serves me.

93
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,202
[SPEAKER_01]: We just made that, somebody made that motion or I made that motion and we approved it.

94
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:31,224
[SPEAKER_01]: It started in November, but it's actually part of a specific policy.

95
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's this language here.

96
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:36,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't necessarily agree with it, but it comes from the state.

97
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:37,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter what I think.

98
00:08:38,988 --> 00:08:47,852
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, the biggest thing I disagree with is that recess does not count as time and learning from a social emotional perspective.

99
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,113
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty hard to stomach,

100
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:56,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big addition here is the observance list.

101
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:04,737
[SPEAKER_01]: And after our last meeting, we did have some conversation around naming of things.

102
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:07,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's very difficult.

103
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:09,961
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no perfect words.

104
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:14,104
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, it's called the observance list.

105
00:09:14,485 --> 00:09:20,629
[SPEAKER_01]: It identifies important dates as variable or static, meaning they have the same date every year or they vary.

106
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:24,189
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be looked up.

107
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:29,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Static observances occur on the same day each year.

108
00:09:30,053 --> 00:09:38,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Variable observances occur on dates which vary from year to year and must be looked up each year prior to the publication of the observance list and creation of the school calendar.

109
00:09:38,931 --> 00:09:44,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Further observances are optionally categorized as no school, excused absence, or blocked.

110
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:54,498
[SPEAKER_01]: Blocked observances are dates when exams cannot be scheduled, major projects cannot be due or assigned, and events associated with Medford Public Schools should not be scheduled when possible.

111
00:09:55,038 --> 00:10:00,220
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to briefly mention this when possible because we had

112
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,312
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like after the last meeting, we were pretty serious that blocked meant blocked.

113
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:15,216
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges I realized is that there are many sports, for instance, that might have a Friday night sports event.

114
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:25,140
[SPEAKER_01]: And if an observance that we consider blocked is a variable date observance, it may end up being on a Friday.

115
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,501
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't say a football team isn't going to show up to a game.

116
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:39,328
[SPEAKER_01]: because the way those are scheduled, they're scheduled, in my understanding, in three-year blocks, or out for at least a year, I think three years.

117
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,132
[SPEAKER_01]: So I added that language.

118
00:10:42,252 --> 00:10:44,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if anybody has any comments on that.

119
00:10:50,861 --> 00:11:03,387
[SPEAKER_02]: My only thought was when we say events associated with Medford Public Schools, how like wide of a net are we casting with that language?

120
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:06,328
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like it could be open to interpretation.

121
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:13,111
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wasn't sure whether that was okay or really not okay.

122
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really,

123
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:30,361
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, without going through all of the events that happen in a year, which is probably 200 or 300 of them or more, I feel like it's hard to know the answer to that question.

124
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:39,468
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, you know, the clubs might schedule events, you know, the student clubs.

125
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

126
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:47,053
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that it,

127
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,280
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good question.

128
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:48,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

129
00:11:48,961 --> 00:11:54,704
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know how to handle that or answer that question.

130
00:11:55,925 --> 00:12:02,989
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if we start with when possible, we sort of give a little latitude here.

131
00:12:04,229 --> 00:12:14,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in future years, if we find out that some club is like, I don't care about these holidays, and they just keep scheduling events

132
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,691
[SPEAKER_01]: that are always landing on very important days that we said are blocked.

133
00:12:21,092 --> 00:12:30,156
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe we do come back and even add another category, like instead of just blocked, we have like really blocked or soft blocked and hard blocked.

134
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:32,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

135
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:39,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with the when possible, it'll give us a chance for that to play out.

136
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:55,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just publishing the list every year will give club leaders and anybody who's scheduling any event, at least they'll be able to go to the list, look and go, all right, look, that is the first day of Passover.

137
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,785
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not Jewish and I would never have known that.

138
00:12:58,286 --> 00:13:00,087
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we pick a different date?

139
00:13:02,318 --> 00:13:13,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also, as I was reading through it, I was struggling with the two lists to think about the calendar and sequence in my mind.

140
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:21,901
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know why it was done this way, because we can't necessarily lock in on when certain things occur if they're on the variable dates list.

141
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:34,046
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm assuming that when we publish the school calendar, like this list of observances would be with actual dates in sequence as part of that communication.

142
00:13:35,201 --> 00:13:35,902
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, yes.

143
00:13:37,323 --> 00:13:39,424
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be sorted by the actual dates.

144
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:53,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, I had this all based on the 2021 calendar, and then I realized this date will move above that one, and this will move below that one, and so the order became impossible.

145
00:13:55,183 --> 00:14:07,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't love this, but I found it, I thought it was better than creating a situation where, you know, the superintendent's office goes through, adjusts all the variable dates, and then we have things out of order because nobody was thinking about it.

146
00:14:08,773 --> 00:14:13,496
[SPEAKER_01]: At least this way, there's not going to be any question that you've got to actually do the re-sorting every year.

147
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:22,123
[SPEAKER_01]: And then evacuation day should be a no school day.

148
00:14:22,443 --> 00:14:23,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you just add the end, Jenny?

149
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,260
[SPEAKER_02]: should not be a no school day.

150
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,560
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it had an N in it.

151
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,442
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not a no school day.

152
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

153
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:32,783
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get rid of it.

154
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:39,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

155
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Elections and primary days.

156
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:45,810
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

157
00:14:48,048 --> 00:15:03,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of those places where like obviously it's variable in a number of ways, like whether a primary is planned or not, I think varies from year to year.

158
00:15:03,618 --> 00:15:12,444
[SPEAKER_02]: There was at least one year where the September primary like fell on like the first day of school for kindergartners or something.

159
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:16,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So stuff like that I think would be important to just have it be

160
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:19,281
[SPEAKER_02]: in mind as we are planning the school calendar?

161
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:24,027
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so maybe I should just add a sentence here.

162
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:35,501
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this list does not include elections and election days and schools.

163
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:45,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, you know, each year there's a different number of primaries or not.

164
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,361
[SPEAKER_01]: It's putting it on here would be a challenge.

165
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:51,941
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many would I put here?

166
00:15:53,362 --> 00:16:02,705
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be, you know, in a worst case scenario, we could have one primary per year, every year.

167
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the election.

168
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:18,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would think that when we publish the list each year that we would actually write those into some best of our ability.

169
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:26,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, we know if there's a November election, we may not know about primaries, but we may when we publish.

170
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:30,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on the year cycle it is.

171
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:44,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I also was going to add, I think that since this never existed in this type of a format, this is excellent and it's something that we can share widely throughout the district.

172
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:57,163
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give it to the athletic department, the coaches to know, for the teachers to get it as they're setting up their syllabi, the principals to give it to them as well.

173
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:00,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that we can definitely

174
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:18,046
[SPEAKER_00]: we can definitely, you know, say, keep these dates in mind and just make it something that is part of our new, you know, part of our new normal, a new way of operating.

175
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:21,367
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I would say.

176
00:17:21,927 --> 00:17:22,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

177
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:23,348
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

178
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:24,968
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great, Maurice.

179
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:25,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

180
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:40,248
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a sorry apparently I had some background noise I know exactly what it is

181
00:17:55,963 --> 00:18:03,688
[SPEAKER_02]: In an earlier meeting, my background noise was my dog running to the window and slamming her face on the window because she wanted to be outside with the kids.

182
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was also background.

183
00:18:08,692 --> 00:18:09,232
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.

184
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cuter than mine.

185
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:12,815
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's playing a video game.

186
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so let's see.

187
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:24,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've sort of written a little thing that I'm gonna read as well about like, you know, this isn't perfect.

188
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:29,586
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two categories of omissions I feel like I've come up with.

189
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:37,013
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no Sikh holidays and they do have lots of holidays and there's no native people, indigenous peoples.

190
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:39,960
[SPEAKER_01]: dates of observances in this list.

191
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:56,159
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'll do is I'll just sort of like, when I introduce this to the floor, assuming we approve it, I will actually say, this is a beginning and urge the public to identify omissions and frankly, any errors that we may have in here.

192
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,100
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Melanie.

193
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:01,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a great point.

194
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:03,425
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would also add disability.

195
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:07,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was not looking at it earlier, I apologize.

196
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:11,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would add April 2nd is Autism Awareness Day.

197
00:19:13,572 --> 00:19:17,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And- Do you know if that one's always April 2nd or is it- Yeah, it's static.

198
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:26,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And October, no, I'm sorry, March 21st is always Down Syndrome Awareness Day.

199
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a typo in autism, Paul.

200
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,331
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

201
00:19:38,231 --> 00:19:39,291
[SPEAKER_01]: You said April 2nd?

202
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:40,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, April 2nd.

203
00:19:43,792 --> 00:19:46,352
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the other one?

204
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:49,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Down syndrome, March 21st.

205
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:51,553
[SPEAKER_04]: March 21st.

206
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:00,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Down with an S, right?

207
00:20:01,755 --> 00:20:02,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Down space.

208
00:20:02,595 --> 00:20:03,095
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no S.

209
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,061
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a common mistake.

210
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:12,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody thinks it's with an S. And syndrome actually is lowercase S. Thank you.

211
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:18,446
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those, it's a whole bunch of things where it's like, is there an S or not?

212
00:20:18,466 --> 00:20:23,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's down and syndrome, the S blends with it.

213
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:24,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So everybody thinks it is.

214
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:27,510
[SPEAKER_04]: John Langdon Down discovered Down syndrome.

215
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,511
[SPEAKER_04]: John Langdon Down of London, so Down syndrome.

216
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:31,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

217
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:32,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the date?

218
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:36,658
[SPEAKER_04]: 321 for 321st chromosomes.

219
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:38,838
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.

220
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:39,579
[SPEAKER_01]: That's smart.

221
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,959
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

222
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,260
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, so.

223
00:21:16,763 --> 00:21:23,879
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so are there any other questions, comments, suggestions?

224
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:27,227
[SPEAKER_01]: Melanie?

225
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:36,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, no, I just really do like the idea of asking for, you know, community input and feedback.

226
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:58,367
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would just say really making that sort of a highlight, even in the doc, you know, just it certainly certainly an introduction, but also just even in the document with a caveat that like we have, you know, community we're awaiting community actively seeking out what have you, I think would be great, because I'm sure there's going to be, you know, the knee jerk response to this list, which will be, you know,

227
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:01,376
[SPEAKER_04]: But mine's not on there, or this is not included, or whatever.

228
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:08,678
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like that you're just addressing that right out front so people feel like it's inclusive.

229
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:09,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

230
00:22:09,118 --> 00:22:13,440
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

231
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't want to make this the shortest subcommittee meeting that's ever happened.

232
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:23,835
[SPEAKER_04]: That could be a new category for our award.

233
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:25,757
[SPEAKER_04]: You might be the winner of that one.

234
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:31,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa hi.

235
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:53,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi no I was just going to say this format like the superintendent was saying um principals kind of do a similar format for their calendars for the year so this would be so they would put it in order as well if that makes sense um you know what's happening for the month of September they would roll this in to their own calendars as well if we could get it to them early enough

236
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:57,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would work out fabulously, I think.

237
00:22:57,564 --> 00:23:02,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And then secondly, don't we have a Sikh temple on Mr. Gav or are they no longer there?

238
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:05,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there is one.

239
00:23:05,347 --> 00:23:13,330
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of ran out of, can't go really just knocking on the door and walk in.

240
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:18,312
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wonder if the clergy association could help you with that, maybe Reverend Wendy or something.

241
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:23,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Reverend Wendy certainly was looping in everybody she could.

242
00:23:24,511 --> 00:23:31,675
[SPEAKER_01]: She did include the, they have a group email list, I guess, because every time I reply, I reply all and I wasn't able to send to it.

243
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:36,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

244
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:46,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I will send her another email just to ask her and then, you know, whatever we approve tonight, if I do get response back, I will just amend it at the meeting.

245
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:50,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul, may I just add it's Down Syndrome Awareness Day.

246
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

247
00:23:56,761 --> 00:24:01,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had a question related to Juneteenth.

248
00:24:02,285 --> 00:24:14,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that we took a vote about Juneteenth, but did we vote to observe it or did we vote to have it be a no school day?

249
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:16,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the state voted to observe it, no?

250
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:20,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's a state holiday now, is that right?

251
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,637
[SPEAKER_00]: It is officially a state holiday.

252
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:26,279
[SPEAKER_00]: It became a state holiday, I think, this summer.

253
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

254
00:24:27,219 --> 00:24:37,005
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the specific date, but I'm not even sure with the... Yeah, the date.

255
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:39,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we normally start school in August, so by June 19th,

256
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:53,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford Public Schools will most likely not be in session for students because we start earlier than most.

257
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:56,029
[SPEAKER_00]: We're usually done by like the second week of June.

258
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if we end up with... I think it's a snow day issue though.

259
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:02,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

260
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:04,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking at the article.

261
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,471
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a recognized state holiday.

262
00:25:06,491 --> 00:25:10,492
[SPEAKER_01]: And does that mean state employees?

263
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:11,852
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think it would be closed.

264
00:25:12,593 --> 00:25:14,433
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

265
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:33,767
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, certainly, you know, in years where we have horrific snow and the snow day situation gets, I think after surviving that snow again a couple of years back, I think we hopefully won't have any problems like that again.

266
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:36,869
[SPEAKER_01]: But, all right, thank you.

267
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:38,110
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good catch.

268
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:42,212
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, all the members will have a chance to go over it in their packets as well.

269
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it OK to hold this in the notes?

270
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:48,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.

271
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:49,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

272
00:25:49,832 --> 00:25:51,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

273
00:25:51,193 --> 00:25:52,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I share this with you, Susie?

274
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:53,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

275
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:57,538
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

276
00:25:57,758 --> 00:26:03,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there any other comments or conversations to have?

277
00:26:04,924 --> 00:26:06,866
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a motion to approve this?

278
00:26:07,146 --> 00:26:10,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, a motion to approve.

279
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:10,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

280
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:32,250
[SPEAKER_01]: second all right i'll take the roll call on that member graham yes member mclaughlin yes member so yes three in the affirmative uh the uh policy recommendation will be sent to the school next school committee meeting i thank you everyone this is i think melanie has another motion though

281
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:37,173
