1
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:13,359
Looks like we're good.

2
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:13,639
Well.

3
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:27,147
We are good to go.

4
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:34,532

00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:31,005
Jenny Graham here.

16
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:31,926
Nicole Morrell?

17
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:33,206
Here.

18
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:34,507
Will Pippaselli?

19
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:38,277
Here.

20
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:40,379
Maria Dorsey.

21
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:43,741
Here.

22
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:46,622
And Marissa Desmond.

23
00:01:46,903 --> 00:01:49,264
I don't see Marissa on.

24
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:53,727
OK, so we have three present, one absent in terms of voting members.

25
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:54,547
So we have a quorum.

26
00:01:55,308 --> 00:02:00,311
And then welcome Emma, who is from the city of Medford's communications team.

27
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,212
Thank you for joining us.

28
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:03,093
I know it's like a busy night in Medford.

29
00:02:04,114 --> 00:02:05,875
But we think you picked the best meeting to come to.

30
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:09,720
I agree.

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,262
Thanks for having me.

32
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:24,914
And then the other folks on the call, I think, for those of you who may not have met some of the other folks in the call, Jen Carlson, Matt Galeno, Linda Laporto and Adele Sands are all from left field.

33
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:26,475
They're our owners project manager.

34
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:27,696
Hi, everyone.

35
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:32,001
And then Matt Rice and Helen Fantini are from SMMA.

36
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:34,324
They're from our team of architects.

37
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:35,225
So.

38
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:41,814
Welcome everybody, so our agenda tonight is a couple of things.

39
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:45,899
1 is to talk about.

40
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:54,431
both upcoming scheduled meetings and to think about who our key audiences are in Medford and how we reach them.

41
00:02:54,451 --> 00:02:58,372
So I think Emma, you'll be like really, really helpful in that conversation.

42
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:11,496
So I did put together with Linda's help, a starting point just to get us like going in the right direction in terms of like thinking about all the various audiences and what they might want to know.

43
00:03:11,516 --> 00:03:12,697
And I think,

44
00:03:14,697 --> 00:03:21,580
you know, we may or may not have identified all of the audiences or we may want to spike them out as we, as we move along.

45
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:30,463
So since it is a fairly small group, I think we can not worry so much about hand raising and those kinds of things.

46
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:36,605
But just go ahead and like, get this document in shape.

47
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,126
So let me share my screen.

48
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:50,929
Can you all see that?

49
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:53,371
Yep.

50
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:54,952
OK, great.

51
00:03:56,213 --> 00:04:13,944
OK, so the first thing that I did with Linda's help is just try to outline some of our different audiences and the kinds of things that they might want or expect from the SBC as we go forward.

52
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:21,858
So I'll start with the row across the top just to give you an orientation of what's here.

53
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:28,303
And then we can maybe move through the different audiences without, we don't have to repeat everything all along the way.

54
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:35,749
And then I think once we maybe go through all of them, we can talk about what's missing.

55
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:43,755
And specifically in places where we have some placeholders or some question marks or nothing at all, we can talk about how to fill those in.

56
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:50,352
So, like, if you go across the top of this grid, we have our stakeholder group.

57
00:04:50,372 --> 00:04:51,793
So, for example, the school committee.

58
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:59,258
And then what we tried to do was, like, group them into, like, some categories of what their primary concerns might be.

59
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:04,901
So, not everybody cares about the same things.

60
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:08,864
And lots of people, like, sort of end up in many of these buckets.

61
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:12,086
So, we tried to be—I tried to focus on, like, the primary things.

62
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:28,659
And then the communication objectives, really sort of like in a big broad sense, you know, keeping the school committee informed on the status of the project and the ed plan, obtaining the required votes on the ed plan, for example.

63
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,080
And then the preferred channels for the school committee is pretty easy.

64
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,201
We have meetings.

65
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:36,161
I provide a monthly update.

66
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:38,102
We hold special sessions.

67
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:39,002
It's all very, like,

68
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:41,568
streamlined and regulated.

69
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:44,990
So everything that happens with the school committee happens via a formal meeting.

70
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,351
So they're easy to articulate in this way.

71
00:05:49,211 --> 00:06:01,335
And then just some frequency and notes that I try to plug in, mostly so that if there are people who are joining us or watching, they have some sense of what is happening already, because there is actually a lot happening.

72
00:06:03,036 --> 00:06:04,616
So if I go down this list,

73
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:10,187
Hold on one second.

74
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:15,948
Where did that go?

75
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,649
I think I lost something here.

76
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:31,131
Here we go.

77
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:35,432
Just found a weird little loop in my document here.

78
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,331
Um, so.

79
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:47,842
Okay, so the 1st, 2 categories are school committee city council.

80
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:49,183
I think 1 of the things that.

81
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:59,974
You know, there will be times where the city council will have to meet that to take formal votes, but that will come much later in the process.

82
00:07:00,074 --> 00:07:07,641
So, I think for now, and for the feasibility study, just primarily what I'm hoping this document can can carry us.

83
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:31,116
through um there's not an active like set of requirements for the council to weigh in but we obviously want to keep them included and involved so um we did talk about we did have some members of the council join us on monday night when we reviewed the ed plan and the status of the project so that was great and then as we kind of look forward um

84
00:07:32,357 --> 00:07:41,445
You know, a couple of the things that I was thinking about is, like, do we do some sort of quarterly update for them, which I can certainly talk to the council about.

85
00:07:42,206 --> 00:07:52,554
And then the other things that I thought might be helpful is like, a CC to them on updates that go out to parents of students so that they know what they're.

86
00:07:53,255 --> 00:08:03,123
Constituents are getting, which might require some expansion superintendent of your Friday email list so that they have access to that same information.

87
00:08:03,143 --> 00:08:03,183
Um.

88
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:15,713
And then invitations to the meetings, um, particularly and I would, I think for those, like, particularly the ones that are, like, important meetings where we're going to do some extra outreach.

89
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:15,933
So.

90
00:08:16,803 --> 00:08:20,226
That's sort of how this whole thing is.

91
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:23,309
And then we have our legislators on the bottom of this page.

92
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:30,115
So, again, like, their needs in terms of the things that we're wanting to keep them.

93
00:08:31,936 --> 00:08:40,300
Apprised of they often tune into council meetings, so just including them in invitations to meetings that are already happening was sort of where I was thinking about.

94
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:52,345
Our state delegation, and then we will have an invitation to them in March to come meet our team so that our delegation has some dedicated time to ask their questions, et cetera.

95
00:08:53,352 --> 00:08:55,635
and then just ad hoc updates as we go.

96
00:08:55,655 --> 00:08:58,999
Excuse me, Jenny.

97
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,320
Excuse me.

98
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:01,662
I have a question.

99
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:02,303
Yeah.

100
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:03,204
It's Maria.

101
00:09:03,464 --> 00:09:04,225
Hi.

102
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:07,453
Um, are is there any requirement?

103
00:09:07,593 --> 00:09:10,555
MSBA seems to have requirements for everything.

104
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:13,056
Is there some requirement on their side?

105
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:16,417
Um, as far as communication with school committee?

106
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:17,338
Well, not school committee.

107
00:09:17,398 --> 00:09:18,678
Obviously, that's not the group.

108
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:23,721
Um, but with the city council with legislators, do they have some important in this?

109
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,964
Not here, so no, formally, no.

110
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:34,746
The MSB does not have its own requirements.

111
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:47,155
They tend to, and Matt and Linda, keep me honest here, they tend to rely on local communities to follow their own ordinances about how building committees and projects are done.

112
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:54,880
And to my knowledge, like Medford does not have any sort of structure that is outside of our SBC.

113
00:09:56,026 --> 00:10:13,129
And, um, like, in other communities, they have, like, standing building committees that are involved in projects like this, or they have, like, town meeting and there's all kind of any number of ordinances that some other communities follow in terms of these kinds of things.

114
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:13,330
Like.

115
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:22,913
I, in my research, I've not found anything that requires us to do anything here in Medford, although I consider the council partners in this work.

116
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:29,356
And so making sure they're informed and they know what's going on, I think is important, but not required.

117
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:50,874
Just to add to that too, Jenny, one of the very few requirements that MSBA somewhat not very clearly states is that they require us to have a certain number of community forum meetings during the first process of the PDP and PSR.

118
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:59,856
I think, Letfield, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe they require us to have three public meetings of some sort in the first stage.

119
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:02,338
Yeah, yeah, it's three.

120
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:06,381
Yeah, it's only three and we'll end up doing more than that.

121
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:08,702
You know for this we typically do.

122
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:14,026
But yeah, it's usually three formal like community forums that are required.

123
00:11:15,287 --> 00:11:22,552
I will add that, that the only approval that we really need from city council is the approval on the debt exclusion.

124
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:31,683
So they'll have to approve whatever the total project cost ends up being at the end of schematic design before it goes out to vote.

125
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:39,415
In Medford, the council will have to approve that debt exclusion, whatever it ends up being.

126
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:51,538
But from a scope and what's going in the building standpoint, unless it's specific to Medford, which as Jenny said, that doesn't seem to be the case.

127
00:11:51,598 --> 00:11:59,521
There's not really a requirement through the MSBA for city council to approve the project aside from the debt exclusion.

128
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:15,830
Um, this, the next grouping, um, are another, like, group of our, I'll say our, like, our heavy hitters in terms of people with high interest in the project.

129
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,070
Um, 1 is our butters.

130
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,612
So we have, I think, just for those of you who may or may not know this already.

131
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:24,512
Um.

132
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:30,134
We have, like, identified sort of the range for our butters.

133
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:31,494
So we have a, like, a.

134
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,942
Fenced off area on a map of who the abutters are.

135
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:42,106
And they're actually, all things considered, aren't that many abutters to this project because we're largely surrounded by fells.

136
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:48,910
But we have actively been working with abutters because there's been so much site work happening.

137
00:12:50,310 --> 00:13:05,355
And as the site work got started, we hand-delivered letters to all of our Abbotter homes and made contact with the folks at the temple so that they knew what was happening from a site work perspective.

138
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:13,677
And they also got an invitation to join our Abbotters email list so that we had a quick way to reach them.

139
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:16,658
The uptake on the, like,

140
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:25,462
Butter's email list is not huge just yet, and I expect that it will continue to grow as the project progresses.

141
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:36,011
We are also sort of in the end stages of putting together a postcard for the abutters, so they get like another kind of communication from us.

142
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:53,338
And that postcard will tell them, will invite them to two specific meetings we have on the calendar, particularly for abutters, where they can come in, they can like look at whatever, wherever we are in the project, provide input, get their specific questions answered as being abutters.

143
00:13:54,499 --> 00:14:11,562
So that's sort of the strategy for our butters is like knowing that they don't all have school age children and they're not all plugged in and that it's like a relatively small number like a postcard felt like the right way to like

144
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:21,386
Be less labor intensive than hand delivery of messages, but another way to reach people and invite them to be part of the process.

145
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:26,729
And then we'll hold some specific meetings for them so that they can come in and chat with us.

146
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,772
And then the next 2 groups are, I think.

147
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:37,149
They're similar in lots of ways, although maybe a bit different.

148
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:39,510
And we probably need to do a better job on the teachers.

149
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:47,813
But we have our teachers, obviously, big stakeholders in all of this, and our parents of current, our families of current students.

150
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:59,336
So the interest there is sort of everything from site work to project options to cost, all the things.

151
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:19,795
The things that we have been largely doing so far are making sure that things are going out in the superintendent's weekly update and posting information to social media with graphics and visuals and notices of upcoming meetings, things like that.

152
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:27,442
And then I think the other thing worth mentioning with teachers is that we have held

153
00:15:28,098 --> 00:15:33,740
Sort of in tandem with our community forums, like teacher based community forums.

154
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:45,145
Which I will add and we have another 1 coming up in March, which will actually occur on the professional day.

155
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:48,907
So we're hoping that we'll have great turnout at that 1.

156
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:52,786
Um, can I also just add to that?

157
00:15:53,606 --> 00:16:02,768
Um, just also do with all like the space programming meetings that they were that teachers were a part of a lot of the envisioning work that has been made it over November building tours.

158
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:11,871
Um, so we've definitely been thankful to have their voice at the table in multiple instances so far and more more to come.

159
00:16:14,053 --> 00:16:14,454
Thanks, Will.

160
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,618
I was like, this one is just incomplete, but I'm moving on for now.

161
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:21,641
Somebody will correct me.

162
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:38,437
So I think, you know, one question that I have about, like, these two groups in particular is, is there something, is there anything we're missing, like, in terms of how we want to be thinking about reaching these two stakeholder groups?

163
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,300
It's like Maria is trying to come up for me.

164
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,280
I'm going to give her a second.

165
00:17:20,294 --> 00:17:21,795
Maria, are you trying to come off mute?

166
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:24,537
There you are.

167
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:37,018
You're on mute again, Maria.

168
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:42,181
Sorry, I'm on a Chromebook rather than my Mac, and I'm having a little difficulty.

169
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,582
I'm not quite sure.

170
00:17:47,563 --> 00:17:53,065
Could you reframe your question about teachers and parents?

171
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:54,146
Sure.

172
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,846
So I think there's a couple of questions.

173
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,127
One is, have we

174
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:01,367
have we correctly identified the things that they care about?

175
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:08,051
And I think in these cases, like we've identified that these two groups care about all the things right in varying capacities.

176
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:22,681
And I think the other question is, if we, if we sort of think about these being the primary ways we're going to reach them, whether it's like the superintendent's weekly update and social media posts, um,

177
00:18:23,757 --> 00:18:33,701
Are there things we're missing in terms of making sure that we are reaching these folks in a proactive way when we need to reach them?

178
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:44,294
Jenny, it's Nicole and I apologize if you mentioned this, I'm operating on like two brain cells with a head cold.

179
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:56,238
But the Gotta Know Medford, I mean, maybe it's not all of the time, but them being one of our few news sources in the city, that's not social media, that's not direct email that could be useful.

180
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,859
Yeah, I think that's actually a great call out.

181
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,840
I'm gonna give them their own row.

182
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,702
And I was supposed to meet with one of the editors there today.

183
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:14,221
And we had to reschedule, so I'm going to just put them on as a placeholder right now.

184
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:18,265
But yeah, I think that's a great call out.

185
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:30,094
So if we scroll down, I think the other things that are, oh.

186
00:19:30,808 --> 00:19:31,528
Can you hear me, Jenny?

187
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:32,109
Yes.

188
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:33,910
Okay.

189
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:53,382
Really quickly, if it's okay, just based on street data feedback and then some of the preliminary feedback, which included parents and teachers in the survey about the strategic plan, there was a question in there around what is the

190
00:19:54,063 --> 00:20:13,769
mode of communication people most want to see when we're communicating important pieces and like the top three were the superintendent's newsletter or newsletters in general, school visits and listening sessions, and advisory councils.

191
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,330
Let's see.

192
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:35,256
So I think from a school visits perspective for teachers, the community forums I think are like meeting that need.

193
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:41,460
And for parents, was that feedback coming from parents as well?

194
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:42,581
Yes.

195
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:46,683
Interesting.

196
00:20:47,684 --> 00:20:51,787
So I guess the question, maybe a question for the group is like, how do we,

197
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:01,163
Is that simply a matter of bringing the project to various school buildings?

198
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:17,952
Because this project obviously actually is not going to really benefit the students that are there now, but instead be much more intriguing to folks that may not really interact with the high school very much at all right now, because their kids are much younger.

199
00:21:17,972 --> 00:21:22,615
So do you have any thoughts about how we might

200
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,521
add that?

201
00:21:26,562 --> 00:21:27,543
I think that's an option.

202
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:51,379
I think inviting people then up to the high school for a community meeting or a listening session or a community space like the Metro Public Library, which might be central, or like the McGlynn, which is definitely central to the city, but maybe using one of those opportunities.

203
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:52,680
I just think that

204
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:59,376
And I can like disaggregate that so that I can see clearly what educators said versus what caregivers said.

205
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:15,409
But if you just look at the top two responses, it's people want things in print, but they also want that personal touch and that human connection in a meeting where they could probably, you know, follow up and ask questions and gain better clarity.

206
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:40,319
I do think in a number of our projects, school tours have been very effective with community members, people who don't come to school regularly, don't know why it's necessary, why this project is important, and sometimes having students doing the tours, explaining why it's so

207
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,381
why it's difficult to do what they need to do, why it's difficult to get educated in this building.

208
00:22:48,382 --> 00:23:00,244
We've found, particularly with people who don't think it's necessary, suddenly they get a tour and they think, oh my goodness, how are kids functioning in this space?

209
00:23:00,284 --> 00:23:02,125
How are teachers functioning in this space?

210
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:11,147
And it does have a different impact, but a good impact for people to go home and really think about it.

211
00:23:13,547 --> 00:23:21,711
Adele, do you normally see the most success with those during the feasibility study phase, or is that a little bit further along, or both?

212
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:23,692
Both.

213
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:24,593
Both.

214
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:24,893
OK.

215
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:25,473
Great.

216
00:23:26,454 --> 00:23:26,734
Both.

217
00:23:26,854 --> 00:23:28,495
I think it's important.

218
00:23:29,915 --> 00:23:31,516
And it really depends on the community.

219
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:36,198
But in one school, very distinctly,

220
00:23:38,536 --> 00:23:45,359
We were just beginning our presentations with the architects and there was such a negative from some folks.

221
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,281
Once we took them through they were like, Oh, I didn't, I had no idea.

222
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:51,262
Yeah.

223
00:23:51,842 --> 00:23:56,085
And I do know that with my own project.

224
00:23:57,297 --> 00:24:03,181
I was getting a lot of pushback from some towns and their financial folks.

225
00:24:03,361 --> 00:24:07,664
And then I took them through classrooms where there was no heat source.

226
00:24:08,804 --> 00:24:18,550
And suddenly they were our biggest champions because kids were having classes with their coats on.

227
00:24:19,531 --> 00:24:22,373
We can take that away and find a place in the schedule to add that.

228
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:23,333
I think that's a great idea.

229
00:24:23,353 --> 00:24:24,574
And lots of people have asked for that.

230
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:25,755
I agree.

231
00:24:29,143 --> 00:24:43,190
Also, just to stay on the parents' side, something else that we've done successfully on other projects as well is going to the schools of the future students whenever there's events.

232
00:24:43,471 --> 00:24:46,012
Obviously, I think we need a little bit more

233
00:24:46,765 --> 00:25:15,614
information or move a little bit further into the project, but something that's been nice is for us to sort of be present with some presentation materials, whether it's a table at when there's parent-teacher conferences or some events at the other schools, so that the parents are already there, and then we're there to offer answers and just updates when they're already going to the school, and it just kind of keeps it on that educational level.

234
00:25:16,273 --> 00:25:20,395
So that's definitely something that we can start doing.

235
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:26,219
Maybe we need a little bit more information about the project, I think, before we can make that really successful.

236
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:38,926
But it's a nice way when parents are already there to have to arrange for childcare and get out of their homes and get to another location to find out more information.

237
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:47,870
Is that most useful when we talk about a narrowed set of options that we're considering?

238
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:57,332
So right now, I think most of you know, there's a lot of permutations, but there's 29 rough, high-level options.

239
00:25:58,232 --> 00:26:02,693
And by the end of April, that will narrow to three to five.

240
00:26:03,093 --> 00:26:03,813
That's our plan.

241
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:08,734
And so are those meetings best held

242
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:21,292
Like, when we have 29 options and we have 3 to 5 options, where is the right level of information to think about the calendar in that way, Linda?

243
00:26:22,544 --> 00:26:32,292
I think it really depends on what kind of information or amount of information and feedback we want back from the parents, right?

244
00:26:32,412 --> 00:26:51,507
If we're looking for feedback on what they think options should be, then maybe it's earlier on, but although I think it's just completely overwhelming with the number of options right now, but- I am hearing that, that it was overwhelming how many options there were.

245
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:52,707
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:26:52,867 --> 00:27:09,131
So I think it would probably be better served when we're really, really close to sort of narrowing down at least the educational piece of the project so that it's easier for the parents to sort of associate with that.

247
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:16,813
Right now, it's just too much for them to really, unless they're really keyed into the process, it's hard for them to understand.

248
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:23,724
I think from just passing by somebody in a hallway or standing at a meeting.

249
00:27:23,804 --> 00:27:30,787
So I think we need to get a little bit further into the project before we start doing that.

250
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:40,966
Yeah, if I can just add, I think the hardcore press is really when we start schematic, and that timing will be with fall open houses.

251
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:52,110
And that is a great opportunity to start to build knowledge of the project, or especially those parents of younger students, get them excited about it.

252
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:53,071
Sure.

253
00:27:54,418 --> 00:28:04,887
I am thinking that, like, once we have narrowed to, like, that 3 to 5 range, Helen, to, like, that will be a good time to seek input, right?

254
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:09,911
Like, in terms of, like, helping the SBC think about, like, narrowing that down.

255
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:37,687
So I think we can maybe look at the calendar, maybe a takeaway for Will and Dr. Glucy is to look at the spring calendar and work with the principals to identify the things that are happening in that sort of sweet spot of end of April and May, where planning to have some presence at things that are already happening would make sense.

256
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:44,711
Yeah, I mean, we definitely know that May is a really a full court sprint to get to the end of the year in terms of end of year events.

257
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:57,238
So I was just thinking, as we were talking, like, if we ask principals to identify three end of year events, and we can kind of coordinate, you know, what would be best for our purposes, that seems pretty easy and flexible for everybody.

258
00:28:58,081 --> 00:29:08,545
Yeah, and Emma, I think this is a great question for you from the city's perspective, and we're moving quickly into residents without current students.

259
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:15,908
I think a lot about them because many people are residents with very young children or

260
00:29:17,231 --> 00:29:19,592
hypothetical children just yet, right?

261
00:29:20,053 --> 00:29:22,614
And they will benefit greatly from this project.

262
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:35,742
But it is also really hard to find those folks and engage with them because they often aren't yet like woven into like and settled on like how they're going to participate.

263
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:38,203
or not in our community, right?

264
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:46,327
So they come to us with like their own lives that don't anchor them to Medford necessarily, right, in all cases.

265
00:29:46,748 --> 00:29:55,552
So I was curious, as we're talking about this, if you had any suggestions in terms of like, how do we reach the folks that don't have children in school?

266
00:29:55,613 --> 00:30:01,416
Like the people with kids in school, we have like a really, I think we have really clear pathways for them.

267
00:30:01,936 --> 00:30:03,617
I am worried about everybody else.

268
00:30:05,392 --> 00:30:05,972
Yeah, definitely.

269
00:30:05,992 --> 00:30:13,074
And I think it is going to be super important to educate those people on why they should even care about this project, which there are definitely reasons.

270
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:20,337
I would say on the city side, we're always willing to share stuff on the city social media.

271
00:30:21,077 --> 00:30:26,618
The mayor has newsletters that go out to 4,000-ish people around the city.

272
00:30:26,638 --> 00:30:30,980
Our robocall system is also super robust that goes out to

273
00:30:32,052 --> 00:30:37,319
We have almost 50,000 contacts in that, so that's a great way to reach a ton of people across the city.

274
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:41,544
Something else we've done for... How many people get the Mayor's newsletter?

275
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:46,110
About 4,000 I think right now, maybe a little less, but around there.

276
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,575
Something else we've done for bigger projects like zoning or...

277
00:30:52,254 --> 00:31:00,680
maybe waste collection, stuff like that, is sending out bill inserts within people's water bills and tax bills and stuff like that.

278
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,082
So that goes through the assessor's office, I'm pretty sure.

279
00:31:04,683 --> 00:31:08,625
And we can do a half page or full page just with general information.

280
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:11,747
You could put upcoming meetings, stuff like that on there.

281
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,070
And Emma, do you have a sense of,

282
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:22,258
The timing of the walks, we get a water bill every 3 months.

283
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:23,299
Is that right?

284
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:25,101
I think so.

285
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:26,061
That sounds right to me.

286
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:26,502
Yeah.

287
00:31:27,202 --> 00:31:31,966
And so I think I just paid my water bill actually in January.

288
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:33,408
So the next 1 would be.

289
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,541
Maybe March or April.

290
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:37,642
Yeah.

291
00:31:37,802 --> 00:31:44,628
Do you have a sense of, like, if we wanted to put a full page insert in a water bill, like, when would we have to have it to.

292
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:48,090
Whomever in order for that to be possible.

293
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:56,097
I can reach out to Judy, who's the treasure collector for better information on that, but I would say maybe.

294
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:09,583
I think she usually wants things maybe three weeks before the bills are sent out, because they have to be approved, obviously, and then go to print, and then go through the whole mailing process.

295
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:11,403
But I can reach out to her.

296
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:13,324
And the Mayors Newsletter goes out how often?

297
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:15,765
That's monthly, the first week of every month.

298
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:22,607
OK.

299
00:32:23,587 --> 00:32:25,848
Would it make sense for us to?

300
00:32:28,253 --> 00:32:39,780
like provide you like a monthly update for the mayor's newsletter so that in a standing way, we just know that we have to give you some sort of update to let people know what's happening.

301
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,040
Yeah, that would be great.

302
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:42,841
What's the timeline for that?

303
00:32:44,502 --> 00:32:46,824
Just like the last week of the month, if you could do that.

304
00:32:46,844 --> 00:32:49,485
That would be great.

305
00:32:50,086 --> 00:32:52,847
And we can leave like a standing section for school updates.

306
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:53,868
Yeah.

307
00:32:54,672 --> 00:33:00,615
And then the robocall platform, can you tell us a little bit about how that's used?

308
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:06,317
Yeah, so we use it for- I guess I would say.

309
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:08,398
Yeah.

310
00:33:08,418 --> 00:33:11,200
So we use it in two main ways.

311
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,861
I would say one way is for urgent updates.

312
00:33:13,881 --> 00:33:15,542
That would be snow emergencies.

313
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:20,864
We'll do construction notices to abutters, stuff like that.

314
00:33:22,505 --> 00:33:29,492
like if roadways are being repaved, things like that that are kind of time sensitive and maybe to more specific neighborhoods sometimes.

315
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:39,182
And then the other way is the mayor does about every other week kind of like events and general important reminder updates to the entire community.

316
00:33:41,825 --> 00:33:43,966
But yeah, we can target by location.

317
00:33:44,026 --> 00:33:51,731
So that might also be a good way to reach abutters, because we can target the calls and emails and texts by specific addresses.

318
00:33:52,392 --> 00:33:52,912
Oh, great.

319
00:33:53,192 --> 00:34:00,657
We should definitely do that, because we talked about that when there was real urgency to get to the abutters.

320
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:05,200
And we had some high school volunteers make the rounds, which was fun.

321
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,342
if they appreciated the volunteer hours.

322
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:13,045
But there's like two feet of snow now, so it's a little bit harder to do right now.

323
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:13,946
Yeah.

324
00:34:14,446 --> 00:34:15,907
OK.

325
00:34:16,528 --> 00:34:17,629
We can definitely do that.

326
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:25,835
And then there was something else that you said that I was interested in.

327
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:27,256
I'm trying to remember what it was.

328
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,718
I don't know.

329
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:32,987
Are there, oh, I know what it was.

330
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:38,688
Are there events in the spring that you think we should be really thinking about?

331
00:34:38,728 --> 00:34:50,691
And you don't have to answer that right now, but if there is the list of city events that we should be planning for, we'd love to put them on our calendar if you could get that to us at some point in time.

332
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:51,771
Yeah, definitely.

333
00:34:51,811 --> 00:34:53,291
I can think about that a little bit further.

334
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:59,753
I know there's obviously a ton of Pride events coming later May, but mostly in June.

335
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:05,894
I think we do Arab American Heritage Month events in April.

336
00:35:06,294 --> 00:35:07,234
So yeah, there's a bunch.

337
00:35:07,574 --> 00:35:08,555
So I can list a bunch of those.

338
00:35:09,215 --> 00:35:21,620
Yeah, I think if you can maybe give us a list of the things where you think it might make sense for us to have a table and provide people some updates or information, et cetera, that would be great.

339
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,741
Yep, definitely.

340
00:35:25,382 --> 00:35:30,404
The other question I had about the water bill, I think one of the things that I have heard

341
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:43,507
like consternation about is that the water bill reaches the homeowner and like half of our city are renters.

342
00:35:44,188 --> 00:35:47,293
So how do we reach renters?

343
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:54,186
that is a harder question that we're always kind of going back and forth about.

344
00:35:54,206 --> 00:36:06,050
I think the best way would probably just be a mailer to their address because that's not going to, you know, whatever owner address that's going to the people that live there that like get the mail from the bail box, you know?

345
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,511
So I think that's the best way along with like digital communications too.

346
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:20,742
And, um, does the city do those kinds of, like, all address mailers?

347
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:23,363
We have done them.

348
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:27,165
I know, like, the PDS office does them probably most often.

349
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:30,986
They're just kind of expensive, so we try not to do them.

350
00:36:31,006 --> 00:36:34,988
Or, you know, we're kind of cosperative from doing them too often.

351
00:36:37,709 --> 00:36:40,910
Well, that was going to be my next question was, what does that cost?

352
00:36:41,331 --> 00:36:42,811
Because it is a lot of houses.

353
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:44,132
Yeah.

354
00:36:45,397 --> 00:36:48,740
Yeah, PDS would probably have the most updated information on that.

355
00:36:52,043 --> 00:37:01,452
Is that something you think you could check with PDS about and just give us some understanding of what the costs might be that they have seen before?

356
00:37:01,472 --> 00:37:01,532
Yep.

357
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,389
This is Jen Carlson.

358
00:37:10,409 --> 00:37:12,390
Sorry, my camera is kind of funky today.

359
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:28,633
I was just going to say another thing that we've seen used in the past, even just, you know, mailing, not mailing, nailing up flyers with QR codes that say, are you interested in learning more about this project?

360
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:36,055
Like put them on telephone poles or especially where there's, you know, denser residential that you are trying to,

361
00:37:37,475 --> 00:37:38,416
get people's attention.

362
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:46,140
So something kind of flashy that's just kind of nailed up where people walk to kind of get passers-by.

363
00:37:52,164 --> 00:38:05,655
Yeah, and I think the other thing that I'm thinking about that has been suggested to me is like, do we create a. A mailing list of people interested in updates on this project that.

364
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:07,577
Perhaps get, like.

365
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:12,974
Similar info to what is going to go out and like a superintendent's update.

366
00:38:13,034 --> 00:38:17,715
So, like, if we're going to send an update to this to the school community, is there a listing?

367
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:21,096
Is there another mailing list of people who are interested in this?

368
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:27,717
And obviously, we could push that out easily on social media and we'll get a few hundred people signing up.

369
00:38:28,357 --> 00:38:32,418
But if we perhaps, if we took the approach, if we were going to do some kind of a mailer.

370
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:47,827
if we did some kind of a postcard or something like that, that gave them a QR code of like, here's the project website, here's how you learn more, here's how you sign up to get project updates to your email box.

371
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:55,994
I don't know if you've tried that before, Emma, or if you've had any success with some sort of loop like that.

372
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:59,097
We had mixed success so far with the Butters,

373
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:12,720
I also think, like, it's very early in the project for the abutters to, like, be super-duper plugged in unless they are, you know, plugged in because they have children or, you know, kids who work in the school or, like, those kinds of things, you know.

374
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:15,068
Yeah, I like that idea.

375
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:17,909
I've worked with Office of Prevention and Outreach.

376
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:23,291
We've done surveys for the new senior center website that we were trying to revamp.

377
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:28,812
And so we sent out postcards with a QR code to the website and to a survey.

378
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:32,053
And we got a pretty good amount of responses from that, I would say.

379
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:34,834
So I think people are pretty responsive to that.

380
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:42,665
And once we have all those emails, we can build the lists in final site relatively easily.

381
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:46,388
And so right now, our system is broken down by school and role.

382
00:39:46,448 --> 00:39:49,831
So parents at the McGlynn or students at the Brooks, for example.

383
00:39:50,332 --> 00:40:01,961
If we just make a list of MSBA info seekers, I guess, and we can just send MSBA specific or just general project updates to them as opposed to.

384
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,792
any school-based updates that may not be as relevant to them.

385
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:22,781
I think they then also put a sign up here, so to speak, on the project website with a button where you can just click on to enter your email address to be on the mailing list.

386
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:28,424
I think once you get them there, the easy part is gathering their email address.

387
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:31,065
The hard part is getting them.

388
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:33,027
It's like a bad circle, right?

389
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:33,367
Yeah.

390
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:37,426
I need to get them the QR code to go and sign up for the mailer.

391
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:54,914
The other group that I'm going to break out here is community members who require translation services.

392
00:40:57,665 --> 00:41:10,554
Um, and we've been doing a lot of work, um, with the folks at city hall with Catherine, um, to provide like in person translation to some of our meetings and then zoom translation services.

393
00:41:10,674 --> 00:41:19,381
So I will call them out just so that they are front of mind as we're talking about all of the audiences that we're interested in reaching.

394
00:41:19,401 --> 00:41:23,263
Um, so I will add them to the list.

395
00:41:25,105 --> 00:41:25,285
Um,

396
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:34,341
And then we have a couple of, like, specialty groups, so, like, our 1st responders, police department, et cetera.

397
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:42,966
I'm making a broad assumption that email is the easiest way to get to them, but I think we just might want to ask them that question.

398
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:48,409
And some of our upcoming meetings, because the things they're going to need to know are a little bit.

399
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,130
Different than the broader community.

400
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:57,443
Our boards and commissions, there's any number of boards and commissions.

401
00:41:57,523 --> 00:42:03,527
Will and I have a list of how to reach the folks on our boards and commissions.

402
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:23,659
And we have been talking about putting out an email that introduces where we are in the process and asks them to provide us some feedback about the kinds of things that they want to know about so that we can tailor how we are communicating with our boards and commissions and we're getting to the right people at the right time.

403
00:42:26,102 --> 00:42:28,292
So that is upcoming.

404
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:49,916
We have the Council on Aging here as like a separate group because I know that this project will be of great interest to our senior citizens, many of whom love our vocational programs and the services they're able to take part in there.

405
00:42:50,456 --> 00:42:59,660
And then also, obviously, when it comes time to talking about a high school and the reasons to say yes to a high school, to Adele's earlier point,

406
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:07,668
Um, it's sort of like a less direct line for for the folks at, um, at that the council and aging might have access to.

407
00:43:07,748 --> 00:43:07,988
So.

408
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:13,574
Um, I think we have to think about the right way to reach those folks beyond what we've already talked about.

409
00:43:14,275 --> 00:43:22,003
And I don't know if you have any secrets, um, in terms of, like, reaching that population that we should be adding to the list.

410
00:43:23,242 --> 00:43:29,567
Yeah, I mean, I know off the bat that Pam Kelly runs a really great newsletter for seniors that's also monthly.

411
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:36,432
And that gets mailed out and like hand delivered to a bunch of places across the city and like a bunch of addresses.

412
00:43:36,972 --> 00:43:38,474
So that's a really good option.

413
00:43:38,494 --> 00:43:42,196
I would also say for the senior center, they do a lot of like in person events there.

414
00:43:42,216 --> 00:43:50,303
So maybe during one of their like lunches or something like that, people could just go with a table and just kind of talk to people face to face.

415
00:43:50,363 --> 00:43:52,144
I think seniors would probably really appreciate that.

416
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:55,519
I concur, Emma, absolutely.

417
00:43:55,779 --> 00:44:15,792
I think bringing the culinary arts, bringing cookies from culinary arts or treats and having people go to them during an event, I think that's a very good opportunity.

418
00:44:18,997 --> 00:44:28,404
Right on target, I have two districts that preferred meatloaf lunch hour specifically to come and talk.

419
00:44:31,867 --> 00:44:38,331
I know the mayor is a regular there, and she likes to call bingo, but we can't let the kids gamble.

420
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:42,074
But other than that, I'm sure we can find something else.

421
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:45,417
I can reach out to Pam.

422
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:52,639
and find out if she has any other suggestions about, you know, how to make, like, more consistent contact with those folks.

423
00:44:53,219 --> 00:45:01,443
And again, like, invite them to be part of the mail list so that we start, like, amassing a list of, like, the people who are interested in knowing more about the project.

424
00:45:04,405 --> 00:45:12,710
And then we had MHS alumni on here, and I think that's a great idea.

425
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:21,562
I don't have a good sense of like how to reach the MHS alumni, or if we have a way to do that.

426
00:45:23,863 --> 00:45:30,845
I don't know if there's necessarily like a complete network, but I can work on that one.

427
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:39,068
I would probably start with athletics, as well as our like guidance department.

428
00:45:49,745 --> 00:45:53,128
There are stakeholders that we're missing.

429
00:45:54,629 --> 00:45:57,832
Did I miss a specific separate block for students?

430
00:46:01,475 --> 00:46:02,016
You did not.

431
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:04,478
And I'm going to add them right now.

432
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:17,740
I assume that includes both high school students and potentially middle school and or elementary.

433
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,640
And we might want to break it out there.

434
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:33,685
Sometimes elementary is like, it's great to do those events and we have done them in the past, but as well, like the, the, the, the benefit that's going to come from that may not be as directly tangible as talking with middle school students, potentially.

435
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:41,207
Do you have like eighth grade tours, Suzanne, or, or.

436
00:46:41,827 --> 00:46:43,228
Yeah, seventh and eighth grade tours.

437
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:44,489
That would be a great.

438
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,812
Yes, it was seventh grade.

439
00:46:50,814 --> 00:46:51,915
Yes, we can embed that.

440
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:53,537
That's a perfect time to.

441
00:46:55,818 --> 00:46:56,059
OK.

442
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,183
Yeah, we can have something set up for curriculum night that happens in the spring.

443
00:47:02,104 --> 00:47:02,924
Perfect, yes.

444
00:47:02,944 --> 00:47:09,950
OK.

445
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:21,137
They just narrow the list of things that they're interested in.

446
00:47:21,157 --> 00:47:28,883
I'm going to go out on a limb and say our students are less interested in project cost.

447
00:47:32,466 --> 00:47:33,967
How glorious for them.

448
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:35,008
Yes.

449
00:47:36,149 --> 00:47:40,012
The only group, the only stakeholders that don't care about that.

450
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:41,534
Yeah.

451
00:47:41,634 --> 00:47:41,754
OK.

452
00:47:42,381 --> 00:47:57,876
I would, I don't know if it's worth adding to that list, like how it would affect like their learning, because I was talking to a student who was filming the Mistletoe Concert last week and I was telling him about the project and he was asking like, oh, so like, does that mean like we're going to have to go to pods?

453
00:47:57,996 --> 00:47:58,997
And I was like, we don't know that.

454
00:47:59,037 --> 00:48:00,078
It's a little too early to tell.

455
00:48:01,019 --> 00:48:03,201
But that was one of the first things that he asked me about.

456
00:48:03,261 --> 00:48:06,344
So I would imagine that's on the top of mind for many of his peers.

457
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:17,551
Yeah, so I think, you know, one question I have is like, what is the best way for us to be reaching students right now?

458
00:48:24,158 --> 00:48:29,883
I think, I'd actually like to talk to the principals about that, because I do think it's going to vary from level to level.

459
00:48:31,525 --> 00:48:32,786
But I think there's multiple ways.

460
00:48:32,846 --> 00:48:34,027
I think there's clearly with

461
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:42,986
school counselors, there's with building leaders, and then I think there's also with clubs and activities.

462
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:53,013
I'm meeting actually with all principals on Friday, and I can start to bring this up.

463
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:55,935
Yeah, that would be great.

464
00:48:58,886 --> 00:49:03,210
And there are different ways that we can participate in that also.

465
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:22,388
I mean, if there are ways that you would like our group to engage with students, young students, and talk about the building, you know, the process, the building, we can change it up depending on the grade level as well.

466
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:41,733
Adele, do you have suggestions on how you've done that before beyond like a table at like a curriculum night kind of thing?

467
00:49:42,473 --> 00:49:43,074
Absolutely.

468
00:49:43,094 --> 00:49:56,905
I mean, actually, I can reach out because we have done at different schools, different levels, gone into classrooms and had kids build things.

469
00:49:57,666 --> 00:49:59,708
But I can certainly

470
00:50:00,722 --> 00:50:02,303
reach out.

471
00:50:02,763 --> 00:50:13,449
We have a couple of people on staff who've kind of made it a semi-career to go into elementary schools to do this, so I certainly can.

472
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:19,413
They've written it out, so I can gather that.

473
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:29,639
And as, you know, depending on the older grades, it's more interesting when we get

474
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:48,649
more in the design like when we're really designing the older kids can participate that a lot yeah but with the little ones do the elementary schools still do that exercise where they create like a

475
00:50:50,598 --> 00:50:50,998
Medford.

476
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:55,599
Create Medford or I forget what it was like the future of Medford.

477
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:56,920
Yes, kindergarten.

478
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:04,542
And is there like maybe an opportunity to like have them create a high school instead of Medford?

479
00:51:07,182 --> 00:51:08,943
I mean, is it a possibility?

480
00:51:08,963 --> 00:51:09,263
Yes.

481
00:51:10,283 --> 00:51:15,024
Do they have necessarily as kindergartners a frame of reference for what that might be?

482
00:51:15,124 --> 00:51:16,925
Yeah, that was what I was wondering about, too.

483
00:51:17,205 --> 00:51:17,425
Yeah.

484
00:51:18,892 --> 00:51:23,936
I mean, a lot of times when you see what they want Medford to be, it's like a giant amusement park.

485
00:51:23,976 --> 00:51:26,158
Disney.

486
00:51:26,258 --> 00:51:27,760
It's always a zip line.

487
00:51:29,141 --> 00:51:30,122
They're animals.

488
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:31,763
There's lots of slides.

489
00:51:34,185 --> 00:51:36,087
There's a giraffe in the court.

490
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:37,027
Yes.

491
00:51:37,568 --> 00:51:37,788
Yep.

492
00:51:38,389 --> 00:51:41,311
I think that could actually be really fun.

493
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:43,673
I can't imagine what they would come up with for a high school.

494
00:51:44,954 --> 00:51:46,716
I'll add it to the principal conversation.

495
00:51:51,565 --> 00:51:51,926
Okay.

496
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:59,889
Is there anybody else like audience-wise that we're missing that you all can think about?

497
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:00,830
Oh, Maria?

498
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:02,831
Yeah.

499
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:19,879
It's actually not an audience question, but we really haven't talked about the community media or, you know, the TV where people can view maybe interviews, meet the architect, meet the designer,

500
00:52:20,685 --> 00:52:41,270
Um, I don't know how well used or how well, um, if people are taking advantage of our community stations, but I, I know when Suzanne's dad was the chairperson of the, of the building, the future, I watched that weekly show that he had that he was showing progress and.

501
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:44,079
talking to people that were involved.

502
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,580
And it wasn't question and answer, it was just, you know, information that they wanted to get out.

503
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,341
And I found it very interesting.

504
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,962
So I think maybe that's something we could think about too.

505
00:52:54,462 --> 00:53:05,766
And when Will and I had talked with the teachers in the TV area at the Vogue, he very much wants to get involved and have the students involved.

506
00:53:06,566 --> 00:53:07,927
Yeah, I think that would be great.

507
00:53:09,783 --> 00:53:16,208
And we actually have a little mini project Matt and I are working on in the next week or so.

508
00:53:16,248 --> 00:53:27,696
So we'll start airing some fun content around some of the space considerations that we're talking about now.

509
00:53:28,736 --> 00:53:37,683
And I don't know if it's for this meeting, a separate meeting, this list, a different list, but what about community partners, places of business,

510
00:53:39,689 --> 00:53:40,129
Tufts.

511
00:53:44,031 --> 00:53:44,972
We can add them.

512
00:53:45,953 --> 00:53:46,773
Oh, sorry.

513
00:53:47,694 --> 00:53:49,655
Sometimes we go to the Chamber of Commerce meetings.

514
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:50,615
I was just going to say that.

515
00:53:50,675 --> 00:53:50,915
Yeah.

516
00:53:57,979 --> 00:54:02,382
And Suzanne, as you're thinking that,

517
00:54:04,934 --> 00:54:14,702
we would want to reach them separately somehow, or that they have a different level of interest, or what are you thinking about?

518
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:17,605
I would say yes, and.

519
00:54:18,205 --> 00:54:31,816
I think in my mind, there's a lot of businesses that have legacy holds here in Medford, or community partnerships that do a lot to support.

520
00:54:33,225 --> 00:54:38,848
Um, the schools, a lot of the programs associated with the schools.

521
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:53,897
And I think it would, some of the outreach might look different, but I think there's a lot of community partnerships and businesses that would be, would be helpful to lend a hand.

522
00:54:54,477 --> 00:54:54,617
Yeah.

523
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,335
I agree.

524
00:54:56,736 --> 00:55:05,979
The other thing is, Chad has to have two advisory meetings a year with all of his programs.

525
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,302
And that's a great place to get to them to do a presentation.

526
00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:13,762
I don't know how he does it.

527
00:55:14,343 --> 00:55:19,845
Sometimes it's one time it's just a working event and the other is more of a

528
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:46,674
eating event, but to do a presentation for the whole, through all of the advisories together and then send them off to their groups to talk about specifics is also a way to get your, your local businesses, the people who co-op your students have them involved.

529
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:47,715
Yeah.

530
00:55:51,426 --> 00:56:04,617
Is that like a schematic design activity or is it more of a like right now activity or both?

531
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:16,646
I always think that involving the advisories because from the very beginning, it doesn't have to be specific later on.

532
00:56:20,442 --> 00:56:21,863
next year's advisory.

533
00:56:21,903 --> 00:56:23,623
I mean, there's a fall and there's a spring.

534
00:56:24,704 --> 00:56:46,772
One can just be, we're here, this is what we're doing, this is where we are presentation with questions just to keep them invested and involved and feel like they're volunteering to be on this advisory to say your input matters to us.

535
00:56:47,192 --> 00:56:49,753
But then later it becomes more,

536
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:52,451
Are we missing something?

537
00:56:53,052 --> 00:56:55,334
Have we not thought about something with your program?

538
00:56:55,434 --> 00:57:03,641
Have we, because these are the people in industry and say, have we not considered something that you think is coming down the pike in your program?

539
00:57:06,004 --> 00:57:09,727
And Suzanne, did you have other thoughts about reaching community partners?

540
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,674
I mean, I can still continue to think about that, but

541
00:57:23,735 --> 00:57:30,841
I, my first inkling was what Matt said about starting with the board of commerce.

542
00:57:31,742 --> 00:57:50,158
But I think there are a lot of groups that also sponsor or assist some of our school based groups between clubs, activities, athletics, that I think we could maybe also generate a list

543
00:57:52,567 --> 00:58:03,672
Even if it's just also to like establishing a relationship and hanging like a flyer, like learn more about the Medford High School project, like just expanding awareness about it as well.

544
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:16,118
Is there anyone else that we're missing?

545
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:37,301
Okay, so I've been keeping notes of some of the to do's and the details that I'll weave into all of this as we talk.

546
00:58:38,121 --> 00:58:42,322
The next table, give me just one second, I'm gonna drop it all onto one page.

547
00:58:42,783 --> 00:58:47,204
This next table is our planned community meetings coming up.

548
00:58:48,544 --> 00:58:56,066
And sort of the, I'll say the goals of each meeting in terms of what we're trying to accomplish to give people a better feel for

549
00:58:58,154 --> 00:59:15,535
what the pathway is, and I think the question that I had, and I'll go through the list, is are there other things we should be doing to reach the stakeholders beyond what we've already talked about that would be unique or different

550
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:24,603
Um, as it relates to, like, getting the word out about, like, particular meetings, or are there things that should happen before certain meetings?

551
00:59:24,783 --> 00:59:27,303
Are there, like, places where we should be adding things in?

552
00:59:27,443 --> 00:59:32,725
So, I'm just, I'll run through the list from top to bottom, and we'll, like, do it in chunks.

553
00:59:32,965 --> 00:59:34,746
So, February's busy.

554
00:59:36,886 --> 00:59:39,407
So, on the 2nd, we have a school committee meeting.

555
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:45,169
That's where we're expecting the school committee to approve the educational plan so that it can be submitted later in the month.

556
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:49,595
On the 11th, we'll have a building committee meeting.

557
00:59:50,515 --> 01:00:00,921
We'll be reviewing our space planning findings of all the surveying work and the work that Helen and Matt's team has been doing so far.

558
01:00:01,522 --> 01:00:07,245
And we will see a review of the cost of the 29 initial alternatives.

559
01:00:12,495 --> 01:00:22,742
On the 23rd, we will have a meeting that we will, where we will approve the PDP submission that's due later that week to be submitted to MSBA.

560
01:00:22,762 --> 01:00:32,650
And on the 25th, we'll have a meeting, it's very targeted around whether or not we pursue a construction manager at risk model.

561
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:39,615
And there's a presentation that we have to hear about what those options are versus design bid build.

562
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:53,381
An application that has to go in and then ultimately a selection committee to pick up to select the that and that all that work would happen in the spring as well.

563
01:00:55,962 --> 01:01:02,464
And that brings us to, like, community for number 2, I didn't have the date handy, but I think it's like, the 1st, week of March.

564
01:01:04,925 --> 01:01:08,167
So, the idea of that community form is to say.

565
01:01:09,785 --> 01:01:25,947
Here is this sort of bigger point of view of all the options that are on the table, that are still on the table, and the rough costs associated with each of those to solicit some more input there.

566
01:01:28,848 --> 01:01:32,490
And then at the end of March, the building committee will meet.

567
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:40,955
And what we'll be doing there is sort of taking all the input that we have so far and saying, what is our decision matrix, essentially?

568
01:01:41,015 --> 01:01:44,356
So what are the criteria that are important to us?

569
01:01:44,637 --> 01:01:45,537
What is the weighting?

570
01:01:45,617 --> 01:01:51,600
And then how are we going to have a thoughtful approach that moves from 29 to 3 to 5?

571
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,282
So that's all happening in February and March.

572
01:01:56,782 --> 01:02:02,304
Any questions about any of those things or anything that you think is.

573
01:02:03,944 --> 01:02:09,746
Not that we should be thinking about adding in that timeline, given what we have to do in meetings.

574
01:02:15,387 --> 01:02:20,289
I know the, uh, the March 3rd PD day for staff can definitely add it to this list.

575
01:02:22,329 --> 01:02:24,350
Is it the 5th for the community forum?

576
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,931
A fifth for the forum and then a third for staff.

577
01:02:40,614 --> 01:02:42,014
I think we got a time for that too.

578
01:02:42,074 --> 01:02:45,315
Just we have a lot of key people on this meeting.

579
01:02:46,936 --> 01:02:47,656
Did that already go out?

580
01:02:49,396 --> 01:02:51,017
I don't think so yet, but OK.

581
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:58,659
Okay, so then.

582
01:02:58,679 --> 01:03:15,005
At the end of April is where we'll be narrowing from 29 or 25 or however many we have that we submit at the end of February to 3 to 5 using that decision matrix.

583
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:17,586
So I do think.

584
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,028
Something there should be some sort of input.

585
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:30,656
Um, session before that meeting on the 27th, or some sort of, like, I think there'll be high community interest in.

586
01:03:31,457 --> 01:03:36,600
Like, the narrowing of the options, so I'm curious for this group.

587
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:42,925
If you have thoughts about the kinds of things we should be thinking about adding to the calendar.

588
01:03:44,346 --> 01:03:46,627
In this space where we're going to go from, like, 29 to 5, say, to 5.

589
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:08,052
Would that be, like, the right time to be doing an open house?

590
01:04:09,233 --> 01:04:14,975
That could also double as, like, here are all of the options on big pieces of paper, so you can take a look at them.

591
01:04:14,995 --> 01:04:23,819
Yeah, I mean, the week before that is April break.

592
01:04:25,139 --> 01:04:25,640
I believe.

593
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:26,760
Yeah.

594
01:04:34,888 --> 01:04:40,530
So the, the March, the March community form is essentially like, this is the, this is the latest updates.

595
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,411
These are some of the designs.

596
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:45,292
March 23rd.

597
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:46,612
Yeah.

598
01:04:46,873 --> 01:04:47,233
And then.

599
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:58,677
So what's, what would we then need between collecting that input and then late April when we narrow it down?

600
01:05:02,499 --> 01:05:05,101
I think it's just another touch.

601
01:05:06,742 --> 01:05:10,205
That's a big narrowing of options.

602
01:05:10,305 --> 01:05:17,711
So just giving people another opportunity and maybe bundling it on a day where there can be some building tours would make sense.

603
01:05:21,594 --> 01:05:25,717
So does that mean you want it during either the April break or a Saturday?

604
01:05:25,737 --> 01:05:28,499
I definitely don't want it during April break.

605
01:05:31,103 --> 01:05:38,347
Because I don't think there will be enough people around to do it, but maybe, like, early April, like, I think we could certainly do that in early April.

606
01:05:40,968 --> 01:05:44,149
Just looking at the calendar and we could do it on a Saturday.

607
01:05:44,169 --> 01:05:44,730
That'd be fine.

608
01:05:52,053 --> 01:05:53,214
So, we can find a date for it.

609
01:05:53,714 --> 01:05:59,637
Yeah, like, add another date, but I think does everyone on the call think that's like a good idea or is that a horrible idea?

610
01:06:00,727 --> 01:06:01,667
Oh, that's a good idea.

611
01:06:02,148 --> 01:06:02,948
OK, perfect.

612
01:06:03,908 --> 01:06:08,410
Oh, go ahead, Adele.

613
01:06:08,871 --> 01:06:25,398
No, I was going to say, I mean, if you could get some kids, I mean, either Honor Society kids who need some time or any programs that really are underwhelming right now, we could have kids.

614
01:06:25,578 --> 01:06:28,139
Kids are very compelling on these tours.

615
01:06:29,923 --> 01:06:31,884
They will tell you the straight story.

616
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:36,646
They will definitely tell you the straight story.

617
01:06:40,928 --> 01:06:49,771
Okay, then May 4th, we have a. A school committee meeting where we have a plan status update on May 20th.

618
01:06:50,652 --> 01:06:51,172
We'll like.

619
01:06:51,828 --> 01:06:59,573
again have a school building committee meeting and we'll have like a this is where we'll have a refined cost estimate of the three to five options that we selected in April.

620
01:06:59,593 --> 01:07:08,899
We have a meeting on the 27th just for like additional discussion about those three to five options wherever we're at whatever the like back and forth is.

621
01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:17,425
And then the decision of which singular option will go forward is slated to be made on the June at the June 10th meeting.

622
01:07:18,546 --> 01:07:20,487
So I think the other question I have is in the like

623
01:07:21,184 --> 01:07:31,911
In the May-June timeframe, are there other things, like, we'll plan to do some community-based events in that timeframe, it sounds like.

624
01:07:32,412 --> 01:07:34,273
So we'll add those to the calendar for sure.

625
01:07:35,574 --> 01:07:41,558
But are there other, like, bigger events that we should be thinking about doing in that timeframe?

626
01:07:51,495 --> 01:07:56,236
Is this where you want to be weaving in some of those community events?

627
01:07:56,876 --> 01:08:03,678
Because I think Will and I can work on that with principals as well as May is typically arts month.

628
01:08:04,598 --> 01:08:08,219
So I think there'll also be a lot of performances, art shows.

629
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:10,559
Yeah.

630
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:19,982
Got it.

631
01:08:23,272 --> 01:08:24,293
They get the whole chart.

632
01:08:24,313 --> 01:08:25,554
They get a whole row.

633
01:08:28,315 --> 01:08:34,299
So I do think that if that's our May strategy, I think that makes sense.

634
01:08:34,499 --> 01:08:48,547
And if we have done the community meeting legwork, like the bigger community meeting legwork in the lead up, we can be focused in May then on getting out to all of these events and not trying to do both of those things at the same time.

635
01:08:49,608 --> 01:08:52,129
Does that make sense to everybody?

636
01:08:54,142 --> 01:08:54,362
Yes.

637
01:08:54,382 --> 01:08:57,565
OK.

638
01:08:58,606 --> 01:08:59,727
What else are we missing?

639
01:09:04,291 --> 01:09:08,034
That seems like a question for the experts who have gone through this several times.

640
01:09:08,515 --> 01:09:09,315
Or Emma and Will.

641
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,522
This looks very comprehensive.

642
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:17,502
It really does.

643
01:09:17,522 --> 01:09:20,045
And as we go through this,

644
01:09:21,597 --> 01:09:28,643
we also may see things, see opportunities, or people may bring opportunities to us.

645
01:09:31,005 --> 01:09:34,048
You may hear somebody say, oh, can you come too?

646
01:09:34,448 --> 01:09:35,149
Yes, we will.

647
01:09:36,029 --> 01:09:36,249
Yeah.

648
01:09:37,511 --> 01:09:37,731
Okay.

649
01:09:40,233 --> 01:09:49,701
And as you start going through the process too, you might get a better feel for who feels like they're getting good information and who,

650
01:09:50,989 --> 01:10:02,233
they might give you ideas of, oh, this group is not somebody that we had thought about, but now we have two people that have said, oh, hey, I'm with this, and we didn't know about this or such a thing.

651
01:10:02,293 --> 01:10:15,917
So I think once you have the starting plan of reaching out, people will also give you opinions on where it's missing or where it could be useful.

652
01:10:17,758 --> 01:10:29,866
I think the key is just to make sure that we don't give out too much information too early and that it's concise and it's the same consistent message to everyone, right?

653
01:10:29,906 --> 01:10:35,149
So that nobody ever feels left out or too clued in, if you will.

654
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:40,313
Does it make sense to have any additional touch points for Butters?

655
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:50,809
Um, on this list, um, later in the process, I know we talked early on about it, but, um, like a special meeting, um, primarily for butter is obviously public.

656
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:56,754
Anyone can attend, but really to let them vocalize their concerns in a more direct way to the project team.

657
01:10:57,975 --> 01:11:01,838
We have two meetings on the calendar, one in March and one in.

658
01:11:04,147 --> 01:11:05,929
I think it's May.

659
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:07,130
Yeah.

660
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:08,351
Yeah.

661
01:11:08,371 --> 01:11:08,831
We do.

662
01:11:08,871 --> 01:11:09,352
We have two.

663
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:10,392
Yeah.

664
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:11,794
March and April right now.

665
01:11:12,594 --> 01:11:12,775
Okay.

666
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:12,875
Yeah.

667
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:29,990
And I think, you know, one of the things that's like challenging about this is like, to the extent that you have like a lot of offshoot meetings, you are, you are then like having a lot of conversations that everyone doesn't have the benefit of hearing.

668
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:30,450
Right.

669
01:11:31,032 --> 01:11:42,343
And that becomes, I think that becomes could become challenging for the building committee to keep track of, because they're not going to be able to be at all these meetings and things are going to be, like, changing or suggested based on something they didn't hear.

670
01:11:42,503 --> 01:11:42,763
Right.

671
01:11:43,264 --> 01:11:47,728
And so I think 1 of the things that we've been trying to do, at least so far.

672
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:54,225
is like funnel people to the places where those big conversations are happening, which is the building committee meeting.

673
01:11:54,245 --> 01:12:04,793
And we did have a number of people come out and I think the feedback about the, the Mentimeter like way to interact with the presentation has been pretty positive.

674
01:12:04,873 --> 01:12:15,821
So I think, um, you know, for those like bigger input sessions, um, it is helpful to, for those to stay like focused, but I think there'll be like, you know,

675
01:12:16,716 --> 01:12:25,619
lots of good, if we can come up with like a presentation that we take out to all of these different places and a way that we collect input.

676
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:29,120
So just so that it can be shared back with everybody, I think that will be key.

677
01:12:35,782 --> 01:12:36,163
Okay.

678
01:12:37,223 --> 01:12:40,104
Is there anything that we didn't talk about that we're missing?

679
01:12:48,558 --> 01:12:58,147
And is there a vote to allow me to update this per our discussion and submit it to the larger building committee for input?

680
01:13:02,972 --> 01:13:04,333
So moved is Nicole.

681
01:13:05,674 --> 01:13:06,255
Thanks, Nicole.

682
01:13:06,295 --> 01:13:08,557
So a motion by Nicole.

683
01:13:08,637 --> 01:13:12,761
Is there a second Maria?

684
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:13,882
Thank you.

685
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:27,847
Maria, was that a second?

686
01:13:29,147 --> 01:13:29,687
Yes, it is.

687
01:13:29,747 --> 01:13:30,107
Sorry.

688
01:13:30,487 --> 01:13:31,528
That's okay.

689
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,448
Okay, I'll call the roll.

690
01:13:32,528 --> 01:13:33,508
So, Jenny Graham, yes.

691
01:13:33,548 --> 01:13:34,168
Nicole Morrell?

692
01:13:35,429 --> 01:13:35,649
Yes.

693
01:13:36,449 --> 01:13:37,369
And Maria Dorsey?

694
01:13:38,249 --> 01:13:38,529
Yes.

695
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:40,950
And Marissa Desmond is absent.

696
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:44,691
So, three in the affirmative, one absent.

697
01:13:44,751 --> 01:13:45,811
That motion is approved.

698
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:47,792
Is there a motion to adjourn?

699
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:51,513
Motion to adjourn.

700
01:13:52,275 --> 01:13:54,737
Motion by Maria, second by Nicole.

701
01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:57,259
Roll call, Jenny Graham, yes.

702
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,060
Nicole Rell?

703
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:58,841
Yes.

704
01:13:59,321 --> 01:14:00,062
Maria Dorsey?

705
01:14:01,483 --> 01:14:01,783
Yes.

706
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:03,825
And Marissa Desmond is absent.

707
01:14:03,885 --> 01:14:05,606
So three in the affirmative, one absent.

708
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,907
The meeting is adjourned.

709
01:14:06,927 --> 01:14:07,668
Thank you, everyone.

710
01:14:08,449 --> 01:14:09,049
Thank you.

711
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:10,330
You have a good night.

712
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:10,851
Good night.

713
01:14:10,871 --> 01:14:11,671
Good night, everyone.

714
01:14:11,691 --> 01:14:12,692
Thank you very much, everyone.

715
01:14:13,093 --> 01:14:18,257
Jenny, what's the language on the motion, the first one, the communications plan?

716
01:14:19,763 --> 01:14:28,551
to update the plan based on our conversation and submit it to the building committee for input.

717
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:35,178
All right.

718
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:38,221
I guess I'll stop sharing.

719
01:14:39,061 --> 01:14:39,422
Perfect.

720
01:14:40,122 --> 01:14:40,703
Have a good night.

721
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,724
We're a few minutes early.
