    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1012.85s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1014.771s">This</a>  is something that I've put on the council agenda before, probably three, four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1021.714s">And</a>  it's something we discuss and bring up usually every budget season, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1028.659s">And</a>  in light of what's gone on in the last several weeks especially, I believe that we truly need somebody qualified to help us write grants, to help our department heads write grants, to be able to tap into the funding that is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1044.131s">We</a>  saw and we've been discussing grants for police stations and other facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1050.385s">We</a>  just saw our neighbor Malden get $9.8 million in a grant, which is approximately half of the new build for their police station that just was opened in the last couple months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1064.368s">There's</a>  also other possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1066.209s">I</a>  know that we could start off by getting a mentor, somebody to help the people here at City Hall that do write an occasional grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1074.591s">We</a>  are lucky and have good department heads that will write a grant here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1079.423s">But</a>  they're not dedicated full-time grant writers, and I think we're missing out on something that can be so beneficial and pay for itself tenfold, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1091.231s">It's</a>  just something that I think the city needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1094.454s">Also,</a>  grant mentor, I was given some information today from a resident who said that the service co-ops of retired executives make mentors available. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1102.78s">So</a>  in the meantime, while we're exploring the possibility of <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1106.632s">hiring,</a>  whether it be a part-time or full-time grant writer, there are mentors out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1110.733s">And</a>  these are the things that the city needs to tap into so that we could do more projects and more projects that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1119.455s">We</a>  could be able to spend more of our general fund on maintenance and things that obviously we sometimes fall short on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1127.877s">So</a>  I would ask for a roll call vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1130.158s">And</a>  we really look into this to get a grant writer and put it in the next budget, if not sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1135.199s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1473.1s">So</a>  Mr. President, if we could just ask, typically, in your opinion, what does this add to the overall cost of a project? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1483.562s">Are</a>  we looking at, is there an industry standard? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1486.663s">Is</a>  there an additional 10%, 20% that you add on to a cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1490.784s">Or</a>  has that already been considered?</p>

    <p>[Jeff Shaw]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1494.43s">The</a>  project as was conceived already has a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1497.852s">It</a>  considers the site costs at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1501.113s">The</a>  actual configuration and how the site is dealt with during construction would be done at that later date when the design is completed.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1511.537s">So</a>  potentially there could be a request for additional funding if need be?</p>

    <p>[Jeff Shaw]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1518.22s">I</a>  don't think I can answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1519.68s">I</a>  think it takes into consideration a hypothetical. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1524.022s">information</a>  about.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1525.303s">Well,</a>  the fact that it's on a floodplain is not hypothetical.</p>

    <p>[Jeff Shaw]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1528.385s">The</a>  fact that it's located in a sign haven't been determined yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1532.588s">I</a>  don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1535.11s">I</a>  don't know exactly if there would be any consideration of additional costs because we haven't done the actual design. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1542.295s">So</a>  there may be none. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1543.816s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1544.576s">We,</a>  we, we heard just the president last night that, uh, you know, money's tight in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1550.133s">And</a>  the only reason why we bring this up is that if there is an additional cost, I think we should know it ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1556.016s">Uh,</a>  so that, that's the only reason why I ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1558.418s">And</a>  I don't know if council along with current already made a recommendation, but I think we need to know, and maybe they have to do some more homework on it, but if there is additional cost because of the property being located in a floodplain, uh, according to, uh, our own energy and environment office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1575.228s">So</a>  I'd make that part of the report.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1576.709s">If</a>  council, I don't think for the city engineer, the,</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1639.401s">The</a>  motion is to send it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1641.341s">I</a>  would like that withdrawn so we can get an update first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1644.882s">This</a>  isn't something that can linger in committee for months and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1648.303s">I</a>  mean, we have eight months.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1649.083s">Then</a>  it would be incumbent upon the committee to meet and to request the pertinent information that's necessary to make an informed, you know, to get the questions answered as soon as possible and request any information that they like.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1658.044s">To</a>  get the pertinent information?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1659.064s">I</a>  would like to get this information, meet, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1663.099s">with</a>  the information and then ask additional questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1665.96s">There's</a>  no reason why we have to delay it two, three, four weeks to even refer the questions out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1672.463s">We're</a>  being rushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1673.844s">This</a>  is being shoved down our throat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1675.544s">We</a>  have questions that need to be answered, and this should be answered first before we send it to committee in a month or two, whenever we decide to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1684.848s">So</a>  I'd ask for a roll call vote on my resolution to get an update.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1840.383s">uh,</a>  Mark Romley city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1841.924s">It's</a>  not under my jurisdiction at all, but I can tell you this, that no one has been designated at this juncture. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1848.949s">Is</a>  there a plan to designate someone? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1850.309s">There</a>  has to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1850.85s">It's</a>  required under the law for a project of this size.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1853.792s">So,</a>  so it's required prior to any design. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1856.934s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1857.814s">No,</a>  it is not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1858.435s">It's</a>  required during the design phase, which hasn't begun yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1863.478s">So</a>  when is the design phase that well, once we get a loan order to pay for the design services, the architectural services.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1869.662s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1870.186s">Because</a>  the way I read the law, it says that OPM has to be hired before the project designer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1876.11s">Okay,</a>  so we're on the same page.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1877.711s">I</a>  think, yeah, we're pretty much on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1879.112s">It's</a>  also concurrently. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1880.593s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1880.693s">So</a>  if you want to use that synonym, that might work also.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1883.595s">That's</a>  fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1884.535s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2181.784s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President, members of the council, Mark Rumley city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2185.206s">I</a>  reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2188.013s">The</a>  communication that the council received late this afternoon or early this evening, I have with me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2196.698s">The</a>  mayor has asked that I read it because not everybody has received a copy, and that would give them the information of what's included. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2204.902s">And</a>  it is to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2209.504s">Dear</a>  Mr. President and councilors, this month, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2212.994s">I</a>  have put before the city council my request for a loan order to finance the cost of architectural services for a new police station at 90 main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2224.102s">I</a>  consider this long overdue effort to be one of which we can all be proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2229.826s">Concurrently,</a>  I have heard the concerns of the Medford firefighters about their training facility and fire headquarters on main street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2239.152s">With</a>  this in mind, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2240.861s">I</a>  have met with representatives of the fire department and have given them my commitment to address their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2247.843s">And</a>  as I said last night, my commitment will be more than words, it is action. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2254.485s">The</a>  action to which I commit is as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2258.026s">One,</a>  I will appoint a working group of fire personnel to assess appropriate sites for the construction of a new fire station slash headquarters and fire training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2270.872s">The</a>  amount of $500,000 will be appropriated for the construction of a fire training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2278.716s">The</a>  sites to be reviewed will include, but not be limited to, the current headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2285.119s">Number</a>  two, the working group will submit a written report to the mayor 18 months after it commences its assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2295.125s">Its</a>  report will primarily include its recommendation as to preferred sites, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2299.894s">for</a>  the construction of a new fire station slash headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2303.695s">It</a>  shall also recommend a site for a fire training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2308.777s">Number</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2310.557s">After</a>  the mayor receives the recommendations of the working group, the mayor will seek cost estimates for the construction of the new fire station slash headquarters and fire training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2323.661s">Number</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2326.482s">The</a>  mayor will submit a loan order to request <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2329.621s">of</a>  the city council to finance the costs of architectural services for a new fire station slash headquarters no later than the end of fiscal year 2019 provided the working group meets all the above deadlines and requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2347.808s">I</a>  am proud to make this commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2350.329s">I</a>  consider it the best way to serve those who serve us so well, the members of our police and fire departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2357.748s">respectfully</a>  submitted, Stephanie M.

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2363.053s">Thank</a>  you, Solicitor Rumley. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2367.116s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2368.117s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2370.939s">We</a>  did meet a couple hours last night with regards to some just some additional questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2375.763s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2376.384s">I</a>  treasure, if you could come up, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2379.086s">Irwin.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2380.247s">We</a>  had requested just the numbers of that break-even point of where <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2385.065s">where</a>  we would have to possibly do, you know, an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2388.568s">And</a>  you said you'd provide those to us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2390.35s">Was</a>  it?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2390.91s">I</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2391.39s">I</a>  did get a handout to the clerk's office today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2395.013s">So</a>  hopefully you received that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2396.375s">I</a>  didn't see that.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2410.066s">It</a>  has a legal sheet on the back.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2417.553s">So</a>  if you could maybe just break this down for us.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2419.455s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2419.895s">I,</a>  as I, um, we talked about last night, the, uh, new growth and how we were going to be able to consider that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2428.362s">I</a>  think Councilor Kern, you asked us to maybe do a 10 year average. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2433.225s">And</a>  so what we did was I looked back starting in 2005, uh, through 2017 and the average new growth was about 1.1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2438.99s">Um,</a>  but, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2446.02s">That</a>  factored in a couple of years that were really meager. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2449.882s">2005,</a>  I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2450.863s">In</a>  2011, we had some really short new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2455.605s">So</a>  what we did going forward on the first page, if you look, is that we used 1.75 as a new growth number. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2465.551s">And</a>  actually, you can see on page 3, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2472.215s">that</a>  our levy of $105 million, just below that you'll see a 2.5 increase and then a new growth number of 1.75. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2480.521s">And</a>  so that brings us to $4,378,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2482.423s">And</a>  that continues all the way down through, let's see, FY, looks like FY 31, all the way down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2495.741s">So</a>  that number on the end there, 4378-373, is the amount of revenue that we'll be able to levy going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2504.788s">And</a>  so what we did was take that number, and then if you do look on the first sheet, you'll see that it's a little convoluted, but I think if you stay with me, you can follow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2518.798s">The</a>  first column is personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2521.988s">And</a>  that is then followed by ordinary income, which is, I mean, revenue, which is just about everything, and then enterprise and debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2533.135s">And</a>  so what we did was take personnel, and we increased that by 2% each fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2541.14s">We</a>  took out the insurance costs and multiplied those out at an 8% increase each year going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2550.028s">So</a>  in the final column, you'll see that we have, in 2017, $3,475,000 worth of debt service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2560.174s">And</a>  going forward, as we get into the years where we'll start to pay back the architect and the police construction fees debt service, you'll see, on the right-hand side, that we will have an increase in our budget in FY <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2578.678s">18</a>  of $4,020,000, excuse me, and we'll have a levy of $4,378,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2581.279s">Are</a>  you following me? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2582.679s">Am</a>  I making sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2583.439s">And</a>  so that gives us $357,000 left. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2584.96s">Now,</a>  if you follow that down, you're going to see that in 2020, we will be in a deficit of $998,000, which is going to require <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2608.625s">free</a>  cash to make those debt payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2613.127s">Going</a>  beyond that, we level out for a while, and then when the schools are paid, and then on the final one, or the second to last one, you'll see that that includes a payment for a new fire station with the architect rolled into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2631.875s">And</a>  so that brings us to a $6,454,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2637.201s">increase</a>  in our budget, but we'll get $5,204,000 in our levy, which will then again require an infusion of free cash.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2647.325s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2647.485s">If</a>  I may ask questions of the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2649.965s">So</a>  this breakdown, I understand the breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2651.826s">Is</a>  this just with regards to our police station or this is if we did both?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2656.688s">You'll</a>  see at the bottom, um, in FY 25, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2660.772s">there's</a>  a payment, which would essentially mean that the police would come online first, and then in five years, we would have the fire come online. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2671.84s">A</a>  fire bond.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2673.121s">In</a>  2025?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2674.361s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2674.982s">That</a>  would be the first debt service payment.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2679.785s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2680.085s">So</a>  in 2020, with just doing the police station, we're going to need to borrow from Free Cash to balance the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2688.571s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2689.909s">But</a>  by you telling us that, that means we will not be able to put another bond on our books unless we were going to take more from free cash until 2021.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2698.751s">Unless</a>  we had an infusion of more new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2704.193s">It</a>  would have to, you know, that these are just projections. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2706.733s">These</a>  aren't, you know, hard and fast numbers, certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2709.234s">So</a>  we would have to see, you know, what happens in the next fiscal year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2713.479s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2713.679s">There'd</a>  never be enough new growth to sustain a library in between the police and the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2720.963s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2721.143s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2730.107s">I</a>  think I understand the breakdown.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2735.79s">Vice</a>  president box. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2737.37s">If</a>  I could, and thank you for providing this in my, my question last night was at what point, because, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2743.437s">we</a>  were told if we were moving forward with the police headquarters, uh, there was no talk about any proposition two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2751.781s">It</a>  was only when we mentioned about combining police and fire headquarters, it was mentioned last night, well, we're going to need a proposition of a two and a half override to afford that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2761.185s">And</a>  my question was at what dollar amount triggers the two and a half override? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2767.155s">And</a>  I thought that's what you were going to provide.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2768.796s">Well,</a>  I can't give you the exact dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2771.597s">I</a>  can tell you that we would be, uh, with 1 million with the police station and a dual, uh, facility, we'd be at about two and a half million, uh, in the negative in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2784.362s">And</a>  that would require an override because we, I don't know where else we would get it to pay for in the next 30 years, every year.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2794.743s">So</a>  you're saying an additional $2 million every year if we were to build? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2798.886s">A</a>  dual facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2799.827s">A</a>  dual facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2800.808s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2801.609s">And</a>  the need, based on the current $38 million you're talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2806.913s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2808.134s">So</a>  if we were able to offset some of that with free cash, the $9 million in free cash, or if we were able to offset that with some grant funding, that would no longer be the case, correct?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2820.325s">Well,</a>  I mean, those are scenarios that I can't give you a definite answer to that it would or would not require an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2828.01s">Today,</a>  I can't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2830.292s">I</a>  can say fairly certainly that, you know, a $2.5 million deficit probably would require it because that's an ongoing debt that would be 30 years, it would be continuing, excuse me, for 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2846.856s">It's</a>  not a one-year thing where we could borrow free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2850.519s">And</a>  again, our free cash is our rainy day fund, our stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2856.984s">We</a>  can't use it to pay debt service for 30 years.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2861.047s">No,</a>  but you can use it in cases of public safety and needs that arise.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2865.191s">Yes,</a>  and generally in cases where you're using it for a one-time fix or an emergency or something to that effect, but for debt service that's going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2875.275s">uh,</a>  30 years, you know, using free cash is, is, is not wise. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2880.616s">And</a>  it's obviously not, not something we can afford to do.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2884.737s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2885.257s">So,</a>  so I guess my question is that, uh, we heard tonight from the mayor and her response. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2891.118s">Um,</a>  so just so I understand, it appears that, uh, we're not looking for at least a payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2897.979s">If</a>  we were eventually to go through with a new fire station, the first payment wouldn't come, uh, until, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2906.736s">2025?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2907.036s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2908.557s">And</a>  typically, how long does it take for us to pay off? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2912.4s">When</a>  would the building be built in order for us to have a first payment?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2916.382s">Well,</a>  it wouldn't necessarily mean when it's built, but when we go to bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2921.165s">So</a>  we would get the architect first, then we would wait for the plans, and then we would do some cost estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2930.031s">And</a>  then we would go to bond based on your approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2933.815s">And</a>  we would have a, you know, a payment probably about 18 months after we bond it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2939.839s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2940.159s">So,</a>  so I'm just trying to figure out the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2942.24s">So,</a>  so if, uh, we were to move forward with the proposal that was mentioned tonight, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2948.904s">And,</a>  uh, the firefighters got together with their group and the firefighters, uh, after their due diligence of 18 months, which puts us in what, 2019, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2962.973s">make</a>  their recommendations to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2964.835s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2965.335s">The</a>  mayor then moves forward as she stated within the paper that she will initiate another design.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2972.721s">She</a>  would anticipate a loan order for another design for architectural fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2977.245s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2978.005s">And</a>  that would take us how long roughly for the plans?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2983.79s">I</a>  would say probably 10 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2985.031s">Same</a>  as the police station.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2985.932s">So</a>  close to a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2986.712s">So</a>  that brings us to 2020 then we get that back and then we go out for an RFP once we get <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2992.981s">The</a>  design, which takes how long, roughly?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=2998.786s">I</a>  would say probably six months.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3000.747s">Six</a>  months, so that's mid of 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3002.989s">And</a>  then what happens between the next five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3008.433s">Is</a>  that when the building's built?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3010.715s">Well,</a>  we have to prepare for building it, and provided all those things go into sync, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3017.64s">And</a>  then at some point, we would be here again asking for a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3021.957s">and</a>  we would do that borrowing based on the time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3025.138s">Ideally,</a>  we want the schools to be paid for before we can go forward on that project.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3033.022s">So</a>  what was stated last night more or less is being stated again tonight that we're looking at 2025 before we see anything.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3042.725s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3043.946s">Well,</a>  I don't believe so because we also, if we bond an architect, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3051.309s">In</a>  2019, excuse me, we have five years to repay that or roll that into a new construction bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3057.931s">So</a>  we would obviously anticipate rolling that into a construction bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3062.372s">So</a>  we would have to do that within a five-year period. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3066.473s">And</a>  the goal is to get that done sooner rather than later, but not until the schools come offline.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3073.936s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3074.556s">So</a>  it seems like we can't afford this until 2025.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3078.452s">No,</a>  we can start the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3081.273s">We</a>  can't afford the debt service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3083.314s">We</a>  could probably even afford it in 2024 based on these numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3091.117s">But</a>  it would give us a little breathing room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3095.078s">If</a>  you see right here, we'll have excess of $329,000 in the year before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3100.1s">So</a>  if we take on that debt, it would probably be similar.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3103.876s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3104.056s">But,</a>  but it seems like, uh, from what I gathered last night, the city's trying to get away as far down the line as possible from the year 2020 when the police department comes online as a payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3115.745s">Is</a>  that, is that not correct?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3116.705s">You're</a>  trying to get as far away as possible to kind of as far away, but we're trying to absorb the costs of the police department and get back on our feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3124.411s">And</a>  then the, uh,</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3126.621s">I'm</a>  just trying to figure out for the firefighters when they could possibly, if everything works out perfect and we know it's not a perfect world, when they could possibly see a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3138.071s">That's</a>  all I'm trying to gather. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3140.573s">And</a>  if it's 2025 or 2024, I don't know, but I think some type of timeline.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3147.179s">Those</a>  are the dates that the debt service would be due. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3150.902s">So</a>  when we bond, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3153.151s">We</a>  don't make those debt service payments sometimes for a year or 18 months after. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3158.535s">So</a>  it could come online before that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3163.138s">Is</a>  there any way we can get a timeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3165.58s">I</a>  mean, is there any way we can get some type of time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3168.462s">Maybe</a>  the firefighters have this in their head already, but I'm trying to get my hands around it just to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3174.107s">What</a>  the timeline is on this?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3175.488s">The</a>  timeline shapes up as it goes along. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3178.109s">As</a>  the mayor indicated in her letter, by FY19, if we bond an architect, we are on our way to building a fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3188.635s">And</a>  so once that starts, then there are obviously, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3193.413s">I</a>  can't tell you what those are, but once we bond it, then our debt service, we can roll it into another bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3202.123s">There</a>  are other ways to look at it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3205.367s">I</a>  realize what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3206.588s">My</a>  only concern is that 2019 and 2024 and 2025 is a big difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3209.051s">That's</a>  a five-year span. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3214.866s">So,</a>  and I don't think the process takes that long, to be quite honest.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3218.687s">And</a>  it may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3219.567s">It</a>  may not.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3220.088s">I've</a>  been here through the building of the new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3221.888s">I've</a>  been here through the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3223.689s">I've</a>  been here under a lot of projects, and it seems like a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3227.73s">And</a>  I just want to fight.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3228.83s">And</a>  it may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3229.33s">We</a>  want to avoid escalation costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3230.991s">We're</a>  not going to start and get architectural services and get cost estimates and then wait three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3238.453s">We're</a>  just going to lose money on that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3239.713s">You</a>  want to wait so we don't have to go towards Proposition 2.5, correct?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3243.395s">Well,</a>  we can't do that in 2017 is what I'm talking about.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3246.056s">No,</a>  but I mean even 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3247.077s">2020</a>  is going to be a tough year, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3251.238s">If</a>  the process was sped up, just say the process weren't perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3255.8s">In</a>  2020, would we be able to go out for a bond with a new fire station? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3261.082s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3261.583s">No,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3262.083s">So</a>  that's what I'm getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3263.523s">So</a>  we're looking down the line for a purpose.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3267.465s">We're</a>  not looking at 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3271.026s">That's</a>  when our debt service <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3272.758s">becomes</a>  due.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3273.938s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3274.358s">So</a>  it might be the year before that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3275.539s">I</a>  understand.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3276.279s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3276.739s">So</a>  I understand your situation where you're saying there's a big time gap between 2019 and 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3283.22s">There's</a>  five years there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3285.041s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3286.101s">That</a>  is not necessarily how it's all going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3289.041s">I</a>  mean, when you're at the end of fiscal 19, you're going to move right into fiscal 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3294.743s">You're</a>  already in fiscal 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3296.363s">That's</a>  the year that we have to get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3298.283s">And</a>  we would still be waiting for architectural services <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3302.272s">to</a>  do their plans and to come back to us and have cost estimates and do RFPs and then decide how much we're going to spend and how we're going to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3312.239s">And</a>  then we would start the bonding process.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3314.241s">But</a>  remember, it's 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3315.322s">We</a>  already kicked the can to 2019 saying this is when their recommendation is going to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3321.666s">So</a>  we've already bought ourselves almost two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3324.948s">So</a>  it sounds, it just sounds like a real lengthy process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3329.672s">I</a>  just want the firefighters to know <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3331.962s">when</a>  we could eventually see a building and having a timeline, just a sketch of a draft saying, this is the timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3340.165s">We</a>  look to get back the firefighters proposal, this, you know, 2019 and May of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3348.608s">Shortly</a>  after that, the Bay is gonna go out for an architectural design in June of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3352.93s">Then</a>  we're gonna get back and review this for six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3356.411s">I'm</a>  sure you could put that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3358.652s">That</a>  doesn't seem like, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3360.156s">complex.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3361.277s">As</a>  I said there are a lot of factors that go into that and you know the mayor's had conversations regarding this and she's eager to get this headquarters built or fire station built. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3375.223s">We</a>  just have to be patient with regard to our debt and that's all I can tell you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3379.185s">I</a>  know she's eager but we're equally as eager.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3381.786s">Everybody</a>  is eager and as I said the longer we go the escalation costs are greater <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3387.14s">And</a>  it doesn't behoove us to, would there are other projects that are going to want to come online?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3391.501s">We,</a>  and I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3392.722s">I</a>  was prepared to vote on a combined center last week, so I don't want to wait another day, but, but needless to say, that doesn't seem to be the druthers of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3401.484s">So</a>  all I want to know is what, what is the timeline? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3403.925s">If</a>  you don't have it tonight, I would ask that the administration provide us at least from myself would be very helpful to see a timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3411.8s">on</a>  when this is all going to take place.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3413.301s">Well,</a>  I just gave you anticipated dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3415.983s">I</a>  mean, you can extrapolate from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3419.725s">I</a>  cannot guarantee you when we're going to have a ribbon cutting at a fire station.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3423.987s">I</a>  don't want to guarantee, but I think the firefighters should have an idea if it's 2024 or if it's 2027. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3429.09s">I</a>  think they should have an idea.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3431.092s">Well,</a>  I mean, clearly, we've factored it in as a debt service payment for 2025, which means that it would be bonded sometime in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3440.337s">21,</a>  22 maybe, maybe 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3441.678s">So</a>  you're looking at 24, 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3443.018s">For</a>  the building to open? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3443.978s">For</a>  it to open? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3453.196s">we</a>  have some type of, I, I, well, I, I'm not, I'm not the procurement person and I'm not the, um, I'm just trying to get it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3460.577s">I'm</a>  just trying to get a handle in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3461.757s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3462.378s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3462.698s">And</a>  I, and I think we've, uh, you know, the mayor has worked with the firefighters to, to let them know how eager she is to have this happen as we all are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3471.339s">So,</a>  I mean, there's no, no, one's going to be dragging their feet in 2000 and 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3476.74s">Um,</a>  about one of the clarification council among occurring.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3482.672s">Even</a>  though nobody's dragging their feet and we're eager, you also just said we can't afford it till 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3486.894s">And</a>  when we can, we're still going to have to take $1,000,000.25 from free cash to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3492.576s">No,</a>  I said we couldn't afford, really, to do a dual facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3497.378s">But</a>  your breakdown says we're still going to have to take almost $1,000,000.25 from free cash in 2025 when the fire station comes on the books. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3506.481s">Right,</a>  and we could do that in 2024.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3509.413s">because</a>  the schools will no longer be online. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3512.334s">That</a>  goes away, all that debt.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3515.056s">Right,</a>  but I thought that was factored in and we still needed to take from free cash.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3518.598s">We</a>  still will need to take from free cash because we have other borrowings.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3523.54s">That's</a>  my, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3525.841s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3526.482s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3527.762s">This</a>  is all assuming that we don't receive any outside funding sources, number one, and number two, that we don't also incur any acquisition, land acquisition costs to find a new facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3540.696s">for</a>  to locate a new facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3542.016s">If</a>  it's not in the existing facility, you know, there might be land acquisition costs as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3546.137s">So</a>  it's going to be a dynamic and moving object.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3547.917s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3551.898s">You</a>  all set another question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3556.739s">So,</a>  and, and, and I, and I appreciate all the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3559.219s">If</a>  you could put together some type of timeline that that'd be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3563.54s">I'm</a>  sure the firefighters would like to see a timeline and I know it's not exact, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3569.042s">something</a>  that at least we can go by.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3570.703s">I'd</a>  be happy to work with ShopCon, who's our procurement director, and with the mayor's office.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3575.804s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3576.484s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3577.845s">My</a>  other question, Mr. President, is regarding the advisory committee that's set up under this particular agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3587.628s">It</a>  is just consisting of all firefighter personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3590.869s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3592.97s">I</a>  don't believe so, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3594.23s">I</a>  believe it's a working group that will be <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3597.436s">have</a>  mayoral appointees, and have appointees by the fire chief.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3601.657s">So</a>  it says, I will appoint a working group of fire personnel.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3606.298s">I</a>  think there will be people besides fire personnel on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3613.901s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3617.021s">So</a>  do we know what it's going to consist of?</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3620.602s">Excuse</a>  me, Madam Treasurer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3623.241s">I</a>  don't no one has been appointed yet but when I was speaking to the mayor today she talked about her conversations with the chief and the chief alluded to that last night that he was going to be providing her with some suggestions also and I know that she had also talked with the president of the union about that but there have been no names designated no I think if your question is if they are going to be exclusively Medford firefighters I think that certainly they're going to be represented to a significant and substantive degree <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3650.313s">But</a>  there could be other professional people that are engaged in not necessarily like fire departments and buildings and that sort of thing or the proper locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3662.377s">There</a>  are all kinds of people that could lend relevant information to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3666.859s">But</a>  the thrust of this and the substance of this <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3669.529s">is</a>  to have fire personnel on this working group. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3672.131s">Even</a>  the numbers, I haven't heard what numbers they're going to be like, how many. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3676.735s">So</a>  could we just reword that because when you read it, honestly ‑‑ I understand your sentiments, Councilor, and the reason we can't reword it is this is a statement of commitment by the mayor and I'm not authorized to change that wording.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3688.904s">under</a>  this commitment, the mayor is saying it's gonna exist solely of fire personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3692.187s">That's</a>  the way, I don't see how else you'd read that.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3695.389s">You</a>  can define fire personnel as being members of the Medford Fire Department, and that certainly would be true, and you can also define it as fire professionals, perhaps who are retired, who are not on the active force, and those who have, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3707.777s">So</a>  if we're going to get down to nuance, definitionally, what working group of fire personnel means, we could take some time with that, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3715.973s">But</a>  I think that the honest truth is that this commitment indicates that the mayor is working with our immediate fire personnel, being the chief, and has talked to the union leadership about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3727.162s">And</a>  I don't think anybody feels for one second that Medford fire personnel are not going to be a substantial part of this, but there's always the possibility there could be retirees or others who could lend their experience and talents to this.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3739.311s">The</a>  only reason why I want to bring it up is because when the original proposal was made two weeks ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3746.428s">there</a>  was no input from, uh, the fire rank and fire personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3750.35s">There</a>  was no input from the rank and file police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3753.072s">So</a>  I want to make sure now as this process goes along that at least we're, we're talking about a new fire headquarters that the fire department personnel be at the table.</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3762.857s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3763.418s">And</a>  I, and I think that's the only reason why I bring it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3765.439s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3765.699s">And</a>  I think those sentiments are prudent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3767.38s">I</a>  understand those, those sentiments and there is the mayoral commitment before the council this evening.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3772.763s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3775.403s">So</a>  Mr. President, just one of the, one of the question if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3778.225s">Um,</a>  so, uh, onto a council and I mentioned if, uh, this working group were to get together and decide that, uh, uh, they need a new fire station possibly, uh, behind here at city hall and a lot behind city hall and, uh, their training, uh, tower, uh, possibly in another section of the city on a private property that needs to be purchased. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3802.802s">These</a>  factors will all be taken into consideration regarding the cost, correct?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3809.643s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3810.063s">But</a>  the architect has a $10 million land acquisition line item in the proposal that he has if we were to build a dual facility on a new site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3821.806s">So</a>  obviously the $18 million price tag for the fire station at the current site would change if there were land acquisition costs.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3831.228s">So</a>  the current cost of $38 million has a $10 million built in or no?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3835.771s">No,</a>  that's what would be for dual site at the present site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3839.593s">But</a>  the larger one, which I think is 49 million includes a $10 million land acquisition fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3845.177s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3845.277s">I</a>  don't remember seeing that one, but was that part of what we would give a part of the original one? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3850.28s">49</a>  million.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3851.741s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3852.981s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3854.482s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3858.485s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3859.026s">A</a>  few things with regards to, I know there's a number of requests and serious issues on the police side that need to be taken care of before this build out in two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3870.488s">And</a>  I know that has been provided to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3874.609s">So</a>  with regards to, is there any going to be anything done to the police station, current police station within the two year period to resolve those issues? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3884.131s">And</a>  then on the same token, we have now nine years before <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3889.733s">you</a>  know, possible nine years before a new fire station is built. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3892.974s">It'll</a>  be online before nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3897.495s">Well,</a>  2017, 2025, eight, nine years.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3898.855s">Yeah,</a>  but 2025 is again when a debt service payment would be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3903.577s">So</a>  it could be two years before that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3905.577s">Point</a>  being, there's some serious concerns in station one on the fire side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3912.019s">What</a>  will we be doing for both departments in the meantime to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3917.522s">living</a>  conditions and working conditions are up to par, such as the mold and the asbestos and the building coming apart with rainwater coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3930.032s">I</a>  mean, some of the living conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3931.353s">Are</a>  we going to put any money into either department?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3933.755s">And</a>  I don't know if it's a question for you, but I would have to defer to either the chief of staff or the city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3940.28s">Yeah,</a>  we can maybe get an idea on that, because not only that, but thankfully, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3946.715s">If</a>  this all pans out, we have two years for the police, 789 for the fire department, and there's some, we discussed them last night, those issues I've already mentioned, plus the diesel trucks in with the kitchen, in with the equipment, you know, a number of different things that need to be addressed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3965.683s">And</a>  I know, Chief, I know there's been a list given to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3969.085s">I</a>  don't know exactly what's on it, but when I walk in your station, I feel like it's unsafe for the officers that are in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3976.243s">I</a>  mean, no bulletproof glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3977.563s">I</a>  think maybe something's been put in recently, but not up to par. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3980.724s">That</a>  concerns me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3981.604s">And</a>  we have two, two, two years before this is built. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3983.905s">So</a>  on both sides, what are we, what are we, what is the city going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3986.765s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Dever]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3988.906s">Jennifer</a>  Dever, chief of staff to Maybrook 85. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3991.467s">George</a>  P has a tribe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3992.967s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3994.487s">Good</a>  evening all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=3995.648s">Um,</a>  to address Councilor Curran's concerns relative to what is going to be done between now and then in respects to the firefighter, uh, to fire headquarters, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4006.696s">the</a>  chief and I have an active dialogue in respects to any kind of needs or concerns that may happen, um, that will happen relative to the working conditions, much like we've had with chief Sacco relative to the cleanliness of the fire, cleanliness of the police headquarters, in addition to the replacement of the windows for bulletproof glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4028.025s">So</a>  we will listen to, um, future concerns, current concerns, um, relative to the safety and the conditions of the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4036.858s">headquarters.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4037.919s">Again,</a>  I'll state that we will work with the chief and we will work with the union as well to listen to these concerns and move forward much like we have, um, with chief Sacco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4046.823s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4047.344s">Name</a>  and address of the record please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4050.926s">Leo</a>  Sacco, chief of police, uh, resided 227 Elm street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4056.068s">Uh,</a>  I've been authorized by the mayor to make the necessary corrections in the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4060.751s">Uh,</a>  but obviously we're not going to do anything that's going to be a budget break. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4065.501s">Uh,</a>  one of the items that we need is, is a, uh, the female officers locker room facility and a shower facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4072.844s">And,</a>  uh, the cost of that, putting that into an old building, uh, would be prohibitive would make any, any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4080.166s">So</a>  we have to make some minor modifications. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4082.647s">There</a>  has been some bulletproof glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4085.188s">I</a>  don't know if anything's really bulletproof, bullet resistant glass, uh, on the forefront windows that are on the outside and two of the lobby windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4093.671s">And,</a>  uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4094.817s">You</a>  know, that, that was something that the mayor probably could have waited if she, where she decided to move forward with a new station, but she didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4102.683s">She</a>  went ahead and authorized that purchase and it didn't come out of the police department budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4108.427s">Uh,</a>  so things are being done to, to remedy the situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4112.09s">Nothing's</a>  going to make it perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4114.232s">Uh,</a>  but definitely there's, there's, there was a cleanup over a couple of weekend periods and we need to continue the maintenance recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4122.9s">the</a>  custodian that's been provided by the company has changed and is doing a much better job than what we've had in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4130.124s">So</a>  the place is a little more cleaner and that just a lot of work needs to be done and we're not going to spend a lot of money on, uh, we're not going to waste it, but the necessary repairs will be made.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4143.772s">If</a>  I can, if I, thank you chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4145.573s">Um,</a>  if I could add a B paper that, um, I know the asbestos was cleaned up in the police department side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4151.78s">If</a>  we can add a B paper that mold testing and air quality testing be done on the fire department, I think that's extremely one of the major concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4160.467s">I</a>  mean, along with a whole list of others. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4163.169s">But</a>  I think that's one of the major concerns that is causing potential or possible health conditions for our firefighters that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4173.176s">I</a>  believe the asbestos in the mold has been remediation in the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4177.119s">And</a>  that's one of the so the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4179.501s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4181.105s">I</a>  mean, it would be great to do it in both, but we know work has been done in the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4185.409s">We</a>  have two, you know, depending on this vote, I think it needs to be done in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4189.573s">It</a>  needs to be done in the first floor and the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4192.836s">So</a>  if we can have that as a B paper.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4194.958s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4199.499s">Gene</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4203.222s">I</a>  have a few points as they pertain to finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4207.946s">We've</a>  talked a lot about Prop 2.5 and tripping Prop 2.5, but no one has mentioned at all the offset of the maintenance of the systems that are in place <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4221.357s">for</a>  the fire department if they wait another five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4224.598s">I</a>  can't imagine that those costs will come down to continue to repair old equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4231.36s">So</a>  there also has to be an offset value on the operating side of the equation that I don't hear being factored in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4242.083s">I</a>  hear and I'm glad to hear <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4245.888s">that</a>  discussions are underway about additional maintenance to these facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4251.21s">But</a>  respectfully, the City of Medford does not do a good job at preventative maintenance anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4258.532s">So</a>  our buildings wouldn't be in the conditions that they're in right now for fire and police, the two sides of these facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4266.814s">if</a>  we had the proper preventative maintenance in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4271.395s">So</a>  instead, we're doing these emergency repairs and these band-aid solutions, and they cost significantly more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4277.537s">So</a>  I'd be interested in hearing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4279.937s">Additionally,</a>  with respect to finance, we're talking about $18 million with respect to the fire department getting a new facility at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4289.439s">I'm</a>  hearing five or so years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4293.523s">The</a>  escalation right now for construction sits at about 5%, and it's upticking since 2009, 2010. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4300.866s">It</a>  was in the negatives then. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4303.067s">It</a>  started to tick back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4305.548s">And</a>  it looks like it's increasing about a percent, a half a percent, depending upon the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4310.93s">So</a>  five today, next year, five and a half to six, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4315.432s">And</a>  that doesn't include if the current administration under <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4322.68s">If</a>  President Trump passes anything to do with infrastructure, you're going to see those costs increase exponentially. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4328.865s">So</a>  everyone's saying $18 million, but it's significantly more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4334.95s">So,</a>  again, I think there's a lot of complexities, and I respect that there are a lot of underlying issues that need to be addressed, but I think that also stresses the need <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4346.999s">to</a>  really look at this overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4351.421s">The</a>  other point I would make with respect to committees and work groups, I think it's pivotal and I'm glad to hear that the police will have representation among their membership as will fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4364.506s">However,</a>  the mayor stood here last night and said it is potentially her intention to redevelop that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4371.649s">So</a>  there should be some citizenry <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4374.192s">represented</a>  on that committee as well, because if that parcel is going to go up for redevelopment, voters and taxpayers should have a say as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4382.057s">And</a>  right now we don't have a good venue to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4388.76s">We</a>  have some other committees that do a good job, but we don't have a citizen development committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4393.183s">So</a>  if there are people at the table, there should be some folks that represent the general population to talk about <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4400.638s">who</a>  and how they may redevelop that lot if the fire department moves. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4405.98s">And</a>  the last point I wanted to make with respect to financing and schedule, in all of these conversations, these past few minutes, I've heard repeatedly about the architect, I've heard repeatedly about what construction's gonna be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4421.185s">I'm</a>  still not hearing anything about an OPM. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4423.986s">And</a>  an OPM will be able to help you guys navigate <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4427.126s">will</a>  help to determine some value engineering and we'll put together that schedule you're looking for very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4434.35s">So</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4436.511s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4438.412s">Councilor</a>  Dolo Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4439.833s">Move</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4440.933s">We</a>  have citizens still willing to speak.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4444.475s">Councilor</a>  name address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4448.217s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4450.799s">I</a>  just wanted to make a comment about the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4454.077s">cost</a>  of the dual facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4457.439s">I</a>  heard $38 million for a dual facility, and I know it would take a couple of years, and then I heard that it would be $10 million to purchase property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4465.302s">My</a>  question is, is it up to $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4467.323s">Because</a>  if you're moving the facility and going to another area, is it really $10 million to purchase a piece of property? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4476.008s">offsetting</a>  that cost, wouldn't you be redeveloping or selling the property that exists currently? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4482.39s">So</a>  really you're not looking at $38 million, I mean $49 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4486.571s">You're</a>  looking at something that's much, much lower than what's being presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4491.172s">And</a>  you won't know that until there's a cost analysis done on either the property you're currently in or both properties, the one that you're considering or the property <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4500.859s">or</a>  the property that you're in right now and the property that you're considering. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4504.541s">Cause</a>  it just might offset, um, entirely and you're still back to the 38 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4509.543s">So</a>  that's something to consider.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4512.744s">When</a>  the clarification council, the administration's estimating 38 million if you stayed on site and then a potential up to 49 if we did not.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4521.969s">So,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4522.869s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4523.229s">But</a>  if you did not and you went to another area, are you, are you seriously paying $10 million for a piece of property? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4528.952s">And</a>  if so, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4530.09s">is</a>  your property worth $10 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4532.331s">So</a>  if your property is worth $5 million, wouldn't you purchase a piece of property worth $5 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4536.492s">It</a>  would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4537.933s">So</a>  you'd stay at the $38 million cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4540.554s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4541.654s">Number</a>  two, as far as the OPM, I've heard it a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4545.215s">Here's</a>  something that actually, if you read into this law, the Massachusetts law that was presented earlier, at the bottom of it, there is an addendum <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4553.469s">that</a>  basically clarifies the law allows a public agency to assign an existing employee to serve as its OPM provided that the designated employee meets or exceeds the minimum of qualifications set forth for retaining a private sector project manager and has experience in the construction and supervision of construction of building of similar size and scope of complexity <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4577.019s">as</a>  the project to which the existing employee would be assigned. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4580.32s">I</a>  don't know if that helps you or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4582.021s">But</a>  if you read into that, if there's somebody that is on board right now that has had that experience, you could probably bring them in as an interim until you find the OPM that you need to get this project going the way it should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4594.126s">Because</a>  I think everybody in Medford would agree that this is something that is incredibly important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4600.029s">And</a>  we should have a state-of-the-art facility for both the firemen and the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4604.231s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4605.051s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4607.432s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4610.116s">Mr.</a>  President, I was wondering if someone from the administration can clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4614.281s">We</a>  were talking about the dates when we could get a possible headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4619.548s">Does</a>  the headquarters and the training tower have to come on board at the same time or <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4625.981s">Can</a>  the training tower be something that can quickly be arrived at, knowing that the nature of building a training tower is far less of an endeavor than building a headquarters? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4637.788s">Is</a>  that something that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4638.868s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4640.129s">I'd</a>  be happy to address that, because the discussion that I had with the mayor, other members of the administration, and Jeff Shaw in the course of the last few days. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4650.715s">Let's</a>  segregate out what you consider to be the lesser of the two, obviously, which is the training tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4655.689s">Uh,</a>  that could be done separately from waiting for a new fire department that does not have to wait that period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4661.97s">So</a>  it's, it's clear that that, that while they have, that will both be under the domain of the working group, that their recommendations on a training tower could easily and well precede, uh, their later recommendations, which I would presume would be later on the fire, uh, fire headquarters slash station.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4681.094s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4682.395s">And</a>  Mr. Mr. President, maybe, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4684.91s">uh,</a>  chief Gilberti can answer this question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4686.751s">Uh,</a>  we got, you know, we, we, we heard a lot tonight about the condition of the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4693.196s">We</a>  know already the condition of the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4696.078s">Um,</a>  the fire department has a number of, uh, specialized, uh, equipment trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4701.342s">And,</a>  uh, if we're looking at a potential building in 2025 or 24, can you address a chief, uh, the need for additional space? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4711.977s">We</a>  know the deplorable condition of the station, but the needs of the equipment needs and space is equally as important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4722.859s">Can</a>  you address what's gonna happen over the next eight years relative to the equipment?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4729.241s">Are</a>  you asking me if we're gonna incorporate it into a new station, the additional space?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4733.322s">No,</a>  storage need. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4734.862s">We</a>  know even with the police department now, and that's one of the reasons, in addition to <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4739.33s">the</a>  condition of the building, uh, the, the fact that these buildings are no longer suitable because they lack the storage for our, our, our equipment, what's going to be done in the meantime, there's about seven or eight years span.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4752.56s">Well,</a>  if we have no way to put, I mean, we, we have to live with what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4757.044s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4757.804s">We're</a>  as cramped as can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4759.606s">I'm</a>  storing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4760.947s">I'm</a>  storing equipment outside today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4764.189s">So</a>  the plans out to, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4766.904s">continue</a>  to store equipment outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4768.425s">Where</a>  else can I put it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4769.646s">I</a>  mean... That's what I'm asking you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4771.407s">Where</a>  else can I put it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4772.828s">We</a>  put as much as inside as we can.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4774.69s">And</a>  we're losing storage when we lose the training academy, correct?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4779.953s">I</a>  will lose two bays over there that we keep reserve equipment in, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4785.797s">And</a>  the anticipation is that equipment's going to just be stored outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4789.18s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4789.48s">No,</a>  we're going to have to find... We're going to have to either auction off some equipment, some older equipment, to make room.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4799.22s">So</a>  there's really been no thought process in what we're going to do with this storage need? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4804.821s">I</a>  mean, we haven't talked to DPW.</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4808.102s">We</a>  haven't talked to even maybe- We have talked to the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4811.283s">There's</a>  no room down at the DPW to store equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4814.124s">And</a>  that storage is all outside anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4817.064s">I</a>  can't store a fire engine outside in the wintertime.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4821.388s">What</a>  about the private sector? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4822.629s">Is</a>  it possible in some of the garages on Mystic Ave or Commercial Street?</p>

    <p>[Frank Giliberti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4827.013s">Oh,</a>  maybe that is a possibility, but we haven't explored that yet.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4830.796s">Well,</a>  I think, Chief, the reason why I bring it up, I think it's an important issue because I think we're centered around the deplorable condition of the buildings, but equally we're moving forward because of the lack of storage within these both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4842.146s">Agreed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4842.627s">And</a>  that's equally an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4845.809s">And</a>  as you know, you don't want to, we saw what happened to the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4849.113s">They</a>  left there because their garages were leaking and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4852.334s">They</a>  left their equipment outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4854.034s">And</a>  vehicles that were purchased two and three years ago were becoming rusted and a whole other host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4860.015s">And</a>  the last thing I want to see, even though our equipment needs something to desire in the fire department, as well as the police department, I'd hate to see this equipment being stored outside, this precious equipment that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4873.218s">So</a>  I'd like to at least get some feedback on what are the plans over the next seven or eight years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4879.207s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4879.767s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4881.148s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4883.229s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4887.091s">Thank</a>  you, Council President Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4894.855s">I've</a>  said many times, if the city needs it, we should just get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4900.318s">What</a>  I don't understand is, however, the building is only 55 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4904.4s">It's</a>  brick and mortar. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4906.427s">And</a>  now it's almost condemned. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4907.667s">We</a>  have thousands of homes that are over 200 years old, and they seem to be in fine shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4913.209s">How</a>  did this station or multiple buildings get to this situation? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4920.312s">It</a>  seems like we have a maintenance problem for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4925.513s">Very</a>  sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4927.574s">I'm</a>  now hearing the city's using new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4932.476s">We,</a>  the taxpayers, should get all that new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4936.568s">that</a>  new real estate tax to offset prop two and a half, or in this city it seems to be prop 2.49%. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4947.637s">And</a>  give the middle class a break on the real estate, home real estate taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4953.022s">And</a>  now I'm here and talking about an override. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4958.226s">It's</a>  never happened as far as I know in 02-155 Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4964.173s">has</a>  had many Prop 2.5 overrides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4967.634s">But</a>  here, I don't think that would be a wise move against the real estate taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4975.696s">And</a>  I believe for every $20 million borrowed, it's going to cost us, the taxpayers, 50% more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4982.238s">It</a>  would be a $3 million bill in the 20-year payback. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4988.239s">By</a>  the way, maintenance is still key. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4991.02s">If</a>  anything is done, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=4994.925s">If</a>  I was in charge, I would make damn sure that so much is put aside for maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5004.288s">Because</a>  the old high school on Forest Street will still be standing, and the new schools will turn to dust. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5011.27s">Please</a>  adhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5012.091s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5013.491s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5018.653s">Mr.</a>  Penter, I think you cut in front of that young lady.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5020.953s">No,</a>  we agreed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5021.554s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5022.996s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5024.136s">I</a>  wouldn't be that rude. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5025.697s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5026.597s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5026.937s">My</a>  name is Robert Pinter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5027.937s">I</a>  live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5032.078s">I</a>  have some concerns as it relates to whatever this agreement might be between the city and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5038.839s">And</a>  the one glaring thing that stands out with me is that the mayor is going to appoint a committee of fire personnel to work as it relates to a new fire station or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5050.082s">Why</a>  didn't that take place for the police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5052.888s">If</a>  she's so concerned about the fire department, it's obvious that she was less concerned about the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5058.392s">And</a>  it's quite obvious by this particular writing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5061.254s">And</a>  it's more obvious because of the fact that no one from rank and file of the police union were part and parcel of where we're going with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5069.619s">Second</a>  thing, as it relates to the location or relocation possibly of a new fire station, the chief is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5076.544s">He</a>  can answer for himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5077.525s">But</a>  last night, he indicated that the present location is the best place for the fire <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5082.952s">location</a>  here in the city of Medford for its headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5085.593s">So</a>  we take that into consideration because the talk seems to be supposedly getting a new fire station at a new location at a later time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5094.175s">And</a>  then we go to point number four where the mayor says she's going to submit a loan order no later than the 2019 fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5102.697s">That</a>  brings you up to May of June of 2020, no later than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5108.119s">But</a>  all you're going to be getting <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5109.678s">is</a>  allegedly a proposal for one, a new station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5113.68s">And</a>  number two, you know, maybe what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5117.142s">There's</a>  no proviso in here as it's going to relate to how it's going to be paid for, whether it's going to be the Medford taxpayer, because we know right now there's no grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5126.267s">She's</a>  still looking for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5127.508s">As</a>  she said last night, she's on the hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5129.609s">And</a>  in some places there's no grants to be found. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5132.651s">So</a>  you're looking at Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer who seems to be the person that's going to be paying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5138.076s">So</a>  I think you have some financial concerns that really need to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5142.638s">Nothing</a>  that's been discussed right now is an obligation of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5146.08s">It's</a>  a, is it's approximate $28 million pension deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5150.182s">You</a>  folks haven't mentioned that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5151.723s">And</a>  there's no upticking on paying that down at a faster rate because the interest rates keep going higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5158.166s">The</a>  other night there was a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5159.507s">There</a>  was a car, excuse me, there was a meeting as it relates to a multimillion dollar refurbishing of Medford high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5166.802s">It's</a>  going to cost factor that's going to have to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5169.604s">Most</a>  recently, this council voted on, and excitedly, for the Medford Library and a $20 million bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5175.508s">And</a>  if that comes through, there's a 40% payback on the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5179.791s">These</a>  are things that really have to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5182.954s">And</a>  you, President Caraviello, in your first term, on the second year of your first term, you introduced a document that talked about $1.3 million of necessary repairs on the six new schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5193.441s">That's</a>  up to almost $1.5 million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5196.724s">This</a>  city has a bad history of taking care of its buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5199.805s">The</a>  private administration ignored all these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5202.985s">This</a>  city council is now being faced with altogether, all at once, a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5209.527s">It's</a>  obvious that the priorities have not been set. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5212.507s">But</a>  the priorities of this particular mayor, her little baby, being this police department thing, and now with the fire department thrown in, she should be here discussing this and making her plea with you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5224.63s">This</a>  is totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5226.91s">You</a>  folks have never had an opportunity to discuss this issue, nevermind the location, nevermind the 35,000 square foot building, nevermind a three story building, nevermind the fact that if you put a combined operation there, according to Dunn and Sweeney, it won't even fit today's standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5243.457s">And</a>  if you look at the 600 plus pages of the report, it alludes to the fact that even if you were to build a new police station and leave the fire station alone, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5251.981s">what</a>  you're going to have is you're going to have mechanical problems that also will have code problems that will not bone up for the next 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5259.764s">And</a>  that's going to be a cost factor to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5263.105s">If</a>  you're talking about a possible 10 to 18 month period or 10 to 12 month period for a designer to come in and an OPM person hired first, everyone keeps forgetting to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5273.789s">The</a>  OPM needs to be hired first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5276.389s">Once</a>  you put that together, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5278.763s">Why</a>  wait and do an 18-month period for the fire? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5281.084s">Why</a>  can't you do both at the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5283.505s">And</a>  if you do both at the same time, maybe you can work out a process that basically says you can build this station in increments as it relates to building a new police station and then working on the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5296.21s">Because</a>  we all know on the fire station side of the building, the building is probably in better shape and a better condition than the police side. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5302.621s">But</a>  who's to say it isn't because nobody's gone through there and council logo hit it right in the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5306.504s">Maybe</a>  you should go in there and have any equality. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5308.386s">Maybe</a>  that building should be reviewed for his aesthetic qualities and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5313.37s">You</a>  know, running around, not having any money from the outside and only dealing with nine, approximately $9 million in your free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5321.317s">That</a>  doesn't leave, that doesn't leave an awful lot because then we can talk about your almost $8 million that you have in your water and sewer account for which Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5331.39s">has</a>  been paying for, and a surplus just sits there, and there is no ongoing proposed work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5336.912s">And</a>  you're hitting the taxpayers with that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5339.233s">You're</a>  also hitting the taxpayer with the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, which in effect is almost $1 million plus you're taking away from the taxpayers, and there is no known program for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5350.978s">So</a>  how much can you keep going back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and say to them, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5355.72s">We're</a>  charging you for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5357.1s">This</a>  is what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5358.961s">And</a>  readily acknowledged by our own treasurer, the fact of the matter is there's going to be some deficit mode as you continue to go forward that's going to have to be offset. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5367.524s">Who's</a>  going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5369.024s">Do</a>  you really want to tell the taxpayer you need a Proposition 2.5 override? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5373.766s">Do</a>  you really want to sell that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5375.766s">And</a>  if everything comes before you, Mr. President, and before your council, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5379.419s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5380.159s">Where's</a>  the conversation as it relates to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5382.721s">Where's</a>  the priority going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5383.982s">Is</a>  it going to be the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5385.383s">Is</a>  it going to be the library? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5386.643s">Is</a>  it going to be the police department? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5387.904s">Is</a>  it going to be the fire station? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5389.945s">The</a>  fire chief made an excellent point, something I never even thought of, and thank you for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5394.748s">Talking</a>  about storage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5396.77s">If</a>  you can't even store what you have on the property that you have right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5401.18s">Where</a>  in God's creation are you going to put that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5403.322s">He</a>  said possibly auctioning it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5404.883s">Two</a>  bays you're going to possibly be losing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5407.284s">You</a>  talked about regionalization the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5409.426s">The</a>  mayor readily said that we could possibly go to regionalization. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5413.149s">And</a>  I believe we heard the fire department indicate and say to you that if we did go to regionalization and we did take one of our trucks and a group of our guys to go there, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5420.674s">and</a>  to do whatever it might takes place at one of these fire academies, so to speak, there needs to be a backup here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5427.556s">And</a>  where's the backup to the backup in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5429.637s">God</a>  forbid there's a major fire that takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5432.418s">These</a>  are things that haven't been discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5434.438s">That's</a>  what you folks should be discussing before you rush into this thing and say we want to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5439.18s">There</a>  is nobody, not one person in this room that would be against a fire in the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5443.321s">I</a>  don't think there's anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5444.222s">It</a>  would all be crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5445.682s">if</a>  there was one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5446.663s">We</a>  all recognize the fact that the need is there, but we also recognize the fact that the city has been extremely diligent in not maintaining its buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5454.849s">But</a>  there needs to be a priority that's set. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5457.532s">There</a>  has to be a goal set here, and there has to be a timeline met. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5461.575s">And</a>  if it's 2022 that was stated last night, now it's up to 2024 before you start to be making these paybacks, what's the cost going to be as it relates to the new station? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5472.804s">Mr.</a>  McCulloch made an excellent point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5474.785s">And</a>  the point is simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5476.567s">If</a>  you have to buy another piece of property for $10 million, is the at-present property worth $10 million? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5481.551s">Are</a>  thereabouts? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5482.612s">And</a>  if it isn't, but it comes close to it, and between the sale and the taxes that it generates, it offsets the cost of where you might be going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5490.298s">These</a>  are things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5491.038s">And</a>  I thank you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5491.839s">I</a>  think it was you, Councilor Lungo-Koehn, who asked to maybe go into executive session to find out who are these other people that the city sat down and spoke with as it relates to possibly moving it around. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5502.823s">You</a>  seem to forget one thing as it relates to where the public works department is, because we can't put any equipment in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5508.907s">But</a>  the new public works building was being discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5511.369s">What</a>  was discussed before this council was building something that could be oversized, not only to handle public works, but to handle our other buildings, whether it be our fire trucks, our police cars, and whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5523.236s">And</a>  there was a pushback by the then administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5526.058s">Why</a>  there was a pushback, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5528.12s">And</a>  there was also a thought process that told us we could just wrap the whole thing around public works, fire, and police. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5534.506s">And</a>  all you would be doing is asking and moving people that are presently there without taking their property, moving their property, so nobody would lose any space. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5542.694s">As</a>  a matter of fact, they'd probably have better space, they'd have front view space, but you'd still have the availability of a fire department that's right there in the middle of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5551.982s">Police</a>  department, maybe move back a little bit one way or the other, but they can get around with their cars a lot quicker than a fire truck could. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5559.27s">I</a>  don't think you should make a mistake by saying, no, we're not going to vote for this or yes, we're going to vote for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5564.694s">It's</a>  the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5566.315s">And</a>  once again, the process has been broken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5569.116s">It's</a>  been broken down because there's been no communication, a lack of leadership from the mayor's office with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5575.661s">And</a>  all you folks are being required to do is to vote for this thing up and down with absolutely not an ounce of input. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5582.594s">And</a>  today is another perfect example of what took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5585.455s">If</a>  the fire department can meet with the mayor to get this resolution between themselves, then why wasn't the council involved before or after? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5594.978s">And</a>  who's to say that this mayor is going to be here in 18 months? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5599.34s">That's</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5600.841s">And</a>  that's what you need to ask yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5602.763s">So</a>  why are you going out on 18 months when in fact, if you're going to be doing this thing for a police department, why don't you do it for a fire department at the same time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5611.41s">That</a>  way they'll have a better understanding and a better acknowledgement to the fact where the fire and police can be housed together like they were in 1962 and like the report said. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5621.058s">That</a>  report of multiple pages from Dunham and Sweeney going back to 2013 is probably the best example that you can have to tell you and to show you why a dual building should work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5632.187s">But</a>  if not, and you decide to go separately in a separate way, that generates and should generate positive discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5638.832s">And</a>  one last thing for Mr. Falco, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5641.954s">When</a>  you talked about that training tower, while it seems to be something that, you know, it's going to be there and might cost $500,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5649.8s">But</a>  where in the city is it going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5651.921s">And</a>  you don't want that to be regionalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5653.422s">Because</a>  if you want that regionalized, you're taking firefighters out of service, out of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5657.803s">You're</a>  taking a truck out of our service, out of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5660.364s">You're</a>  putting backup there, and there's nobody there for the backup. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5663.706s">And</a>  that's the problem that we're going to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5665.187s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5665.827s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Joyce Paul]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5675.751s">Joyce</a>  Paul, 8 Mason Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5679.658s">I'm</a>  not here to criticize. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5681.239s">I'm</a>  just here to express my opinion, my concern, and some amazement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5687.702s">We</a>  all understand that we have major decisions to be made and that major money is involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5697.046s">I</a>  was a contracting officer for the federal government for 22 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5701.728s">I</a>  dealt with from the architectural services to the completion of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5709.361s">I</a>  dealt with the new federal courthouse at Springfield, border stations, the Coast Guard building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5715.906s">And</a>  I feel every time I come here and I listen to what goes on, we don't understand, we have misinformation, we have lots of questions, and it's very difficult for me to understand why things are happening with the mayor, if you will, offside, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5737.49s">and</a>  why you people most especially are being excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5742.531s">We</a>  hired you, voted for you, in essence hired you to represent us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5749.233s">And</a>  it seems like it is very unfair the way you are being treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5754.434s">And</a>  when you are being asked to, two weeks ago or last week, I was watching it on television, it was like, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5762.47s">$2</a>  million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5762.91s">You</a>  know, $2 million, like it's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5766.692s">Property</a>  taxes have gone up, I think, 35 years in a row. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5771.594s">And</a>  now, as I understood it, we definitely need the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5777.157s">We've</a>  needed it for like 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5779.198s">All</a>  of a sudden, out of nowhere, comes we need the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5782.459s">Well,</a>  I'm not disagreeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5784.76s">But</a>  yikes, every time you turn around, there's this or that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5788.782s">Then</a>  the mayor has some kind of meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5791.505s">and</a>  something happens and the communication to me is just awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5799.109s">And</a>  when you are being expected to vote on things, this is not the way things should be handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5806.153s">The</a>  federal government wanted open, found that open government worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5811.918s">and</a>  I would suggest that we need some of that in Medford because we, the taxpayers, are going to pay for this and we like it to work and you are being held responsible for things that I think it's just very poorly <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5830.205s">very</a>  poor management and I don't blame you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5832.487s">I</a>  just think there's all this cloak and dagger stuff going on that's really not right and it's really not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5840.473s">So</a>  I hope things get better for you because I hope things get better for us and things get a little bit better organized.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5848.099s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Joyce Paul]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5848.559s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5849.48s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5852.302s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5853.163s">I</a>  just wanted to go back to Mr. Petra's point about the <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5856.27s">regionalization</a>  of the tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5857.751s">I'm</a>  not in favor of regionalizing the tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5859.672s">The</a>  questions I had last night were just basically, what are the disadvantages of regionalizing the tower? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5865.316s">That</a>  was it, but I want to keep the tower here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5868.358s">I</a>  think it's advantageous to us.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5871.921s">I</a>  think our tower's the regional tower.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5874.002s">Yeah,</a>  and it benefits our firefighters, so I mean, I want to keep the tower here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5877.644s">I</a>  just want to make that clear.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5878.925s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5879.446s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5880.346s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, as seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5887.11s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Bill O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5888.37s">Bill</a>  O'Brien, present local 1032, office of 340 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5893.672s">Councilor</a>  Marks, I just wanted to clarify something or have something clarified, is that you had a very good question of when the fire <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5901.937s">when</a>  the fire headquarters could be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5904.298s">And</a>  I think that, you know, that wasn't the agreement that we, we worked out was that we're looking down the road for five years and not 2025 for a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5915.423s">Um,</a>  and if the, if the treasurer can have that information, I believe what our understanding was, we could go out to bond, um, and have a fire station in the city by 2023 it's physically, it's financially possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5929.249s">Am</a>  I correct?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Irwin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5931.029s">If</a>  I may, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5933.15s">I</a>  think that there is a little sort of misunderstanding with regard to debt service versus ability to bond and start projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5944.295s">And</a>  so that does need to be clarified, that I do believe that we would be able to have a fire station certainly underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5954.039s">And</a>  I can't say when it would be completed, but 2023 would certainly be what was in the <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5961.559s">what</a>  was being planned, I would, I would think five years out and a debt service payment would be in 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5968.062s">So</a>  everyone's on the same page on that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5974.745s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5975.865s">And</a>  that's precisely why I asked for, for a timeframe because I wasn't privy to the meeting this afternoon between the union and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5985.31s">But</a>  it's clear to me that they weren't on the same page because from what I heard tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5990.608s">We're</a>  looking at more of 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=5993.189s">But</a>  needless to say, Mr. President, you know, to get everything lined up and to make sure that we're working on a process now where one didn't exist the last two weeks is extremely important if we're going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6007.736s">So</a>  I think it's vital, Mr. President, that we get some type of timeline from the administration on this on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6015.079s">So</a>  I don't know if you know, I'm prepared to make a vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6019.979s">I'll</a>  be quite frank, I am not happy, Mr. President, with the results that took place after today's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6029.107s">I</a>  still feel strongly that a combined center is the fiscally prudent thing to do for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6036.574s">According</a>  to the $100,000 report, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6039.633s">that</a>  we commissioned for feasibility study back in 2013 from Dunham and Sweeney for the Medford Police and Fire Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6047.597s">They</a>  recommended a combined center. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6051.959s">Also,</a>  the mayor's transition team that was put together by Mayor Burke, the Business and Economic Development Committee, held countless meetings, met with the general public, and their recommendation was to sell the land and build a combined center somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6067.327s">So</a>  clearly, Mr. President, we have not taken the recommendations of the mayor's transition team, and we have not taken the recommendations of $100,000 study that we commissioned, and we went off in a different direction, and with very little fanfare, very little input. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6083.754s">So</a>  I am not happy, but again, as I told the union reps today that contacted me, I will not stand in the way, Mr. President, but I think clearly for everyone's sake, for the unions, for the taxpayers of this community, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6096.688s">and</a>  for this council that we should have a timeline on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6100.529s">I</a>  can't state it enough, Mr. President, because I don't want tomorrow for the union to pick up the phone and say, you know what, we didn't realize this was going to take place because you know, if we vote on our first reading tonight, there's no, there's no going back.</p>

    <p>[Bill O'Brien]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6114.254s">We</a>  understand that Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6115.655s">And</a>  we, we did talk, we talked at length about a timeline and it's spelled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6123.358s">Now</a>  we can't, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6124.827s">we</a>  can't predict about, you know, this fire personnel, the working group of fire personnel will be prepared in 18 months to make a recommendation to this, to the mayor of where a new head fire headquarters will go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6140.074s">We</a>  will be ready in 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6142.155s">That's</a>  our timeline going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6144.476s">After</a>  the 18 months by fiscal year 19, which starts a fiscal year starts June, July 1st of 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6154.679s">18</a>  so anytime between that we're looking to have this council vote on a bond for an architectural services. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6162.566s">That's</a>  what we're looking for with assurances from this administration that once we're done, do this and we're moving forward with the new fire headquarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6171.233s">That's,</a>  I can't predict month to month, you know, week to week or what goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6175.336s">And</a>  I, and I agree with you and maybe make sure you guys know what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6179.119s">I</a>  agree with your Councilor and, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6180.627s">And</a>  from what, you know, we're going to, you sat down and we talked to the administration and we're hoping that, you know, going forward, they're going to hold up their rent because we're going to make sure they hold up their rent.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6192.372s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6192.872s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6193.912s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6195.873s">I'll</a>  yield.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6198.694s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6200.555s">Cheryl</a>  Rodriguez, 281 Park Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6203.676s">So</a>  I've heard a lot of people talking about the combined facility would be $38 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6209.244s">We</a>  heard at the debates that they got $10 million in Malden for their police station, and that this administration didn't apply for any because of time restrictions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6218.727s">But</a>  if they had gotten $10 million for the facility, that would have brought our costs down to $28 million, which would be only $6 million more than they were talking about for just building a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6229.859s">when</a>  we still have a fire station that will be looming over our heads waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6233.96s">Do</a>  we have any assurances that there'll be time to file for grants for the fire station, or are we just going to pay full price for that one too? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6241.383s">Because</a>  I heard that they're very concerned about us as taxpayers having to shoulder these bills, but I haven't heard of any grant applications going out to help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6250.846s">to</a>  offset these bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6252.247s">I've</a>  seen grants for libraries. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6253.547s">I've</a>  seen grants for renovating sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6255.728s">Yes,</a>  we're renovating sidewalks at a cost to the taxpayer of a quarter of a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6260.63s">So</a>  I would encourage, strongly encourage, and I hope that other people do encourage <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6266.065s">The</a>  administration to go after these grants because we just left $10 million on the table for the police station at a minimum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6272.352s">Perhaps</a>  there were more grants if we combined a police and fire station and we could be having a ribbon cutting or a shoveling for a combined police and fire station.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6281.823s">Can</a>  I ask you where this $10 million grant was?</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6286.278s">When</a>  we had the debates, there was a Malden City Councilor who was overseeing it at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6292.081s">That</a>  was in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6293.021s">And</a>  he said that in Malden, they got $9.8 million for their police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6297.123s">So</a>  we know that the mayor is aware of these grants because she was present at the stage <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6302.242s">and</a>  clapped vigorously at the grants that he received. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6305.583s">And</a>  I would have assumed that a phone call to the mayor would have yielded details. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6310.704s">I'm</a>  not the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6311.844s">Had</a>  I made the phone call, it wouldn't have had any effect on this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6315.225s">I'm</a>  more than happy to make the phone call and call the mayor's office and let her know what the grants are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6322.732s">What</a>  we need to do now is since we're clearly going to go forward on just a police station, before the fire tower is knocked down, a new location should be picked for that fire tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6332.836s">Money</a>  should be allocated for that fire tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6335.416s">The</a>  firefighters should be confident that in conjunction with their tower being torn down, a new one will be placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6342.319s">They</a>  shouldn't wait until 2023 or 2024. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6346.658s">or</a>  2022 or whenever to get their tower. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6348.76s">They</a>  should get their tower immediately because as we're told our insurance rates will go up if they don't have a tower because they'll not be able to do training here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6356.627s">And</a>  we also need to figure out where they're going to store their equipment because the very idea of the police, the fire chief thinking that he has to auction off equipment because he has nowhere to store it is chilling and upsetting to me as a taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6370.71s">I</a>  saw the reaction on some of the Councilors' faces and it was upsetting to them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6374.154s">And</a>  that's something that would have been addressed had these meetings not taken place behind closed doors with a handful of people who all nodded in unison because they agreed with what was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6385.185s">We</a>  need diverse voices at the table so that multiple layered conversations can take place <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6390.71s">And</a>  these things don't come upon us at the last minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6393.792s">So</a>  I encourage the administration to invite people to the table who will give her different ideas, and not just ideas that agree with hers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6401.298s">That's</a>  very important to any administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6403.84s">And</a>  I encourage a future administration in Medford to do the same.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6407.984s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6408.404s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6409.945s">And</a>  I know the administration did state that they are looking for grants, both the federal and state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6416.47s">Councilor</a>  Longo-Chagran.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6417.971s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6420.289s">I</a>  think I stated two weeks ago, this is probably the worst way anything's ever been proposed with regards to a bond in 16 years I've been on the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6431.212s">I</a>  think the right way to do it is exactly what's written in the memo today, dated February 28th, where a working group will be set up and it will take 18 months to assess and figure out the best location and <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6447.438s">figure</a>  out everything that's going to be needed for a new fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6450.841s">That's</a>  the proper way to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6453.342s">And</a>  that's what should have been done nine months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6456.385s">It</a>  should have been open and transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6458.987s">I'm</a>  having a tough time knowing really the position we were put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6463.21s">It's</a>  extremely tough to make a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6467.253s">The</a>  lack of transparency, lack of communication, closed-door discussions, I feel like this is being shoved down our throat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6478.562s">I</a>  truly feel that a dual facility is going to be the most fiscally responsible way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6485.828s">And</a>  I think that has to take place after a few months of multiple, multiple working groups to figure out, number one, a working group to research grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6497.418s">The</a>  mayor stated yesterday that she's been in discussions with, I believe, Representative Donato, Catherine Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6506.698s">What</a>  time has been put into finding a grant and are there grants out there for dual facility? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6513.441s">That</a>  needs to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6515.582s">I</a>  would, for the taxpayers, we're under a lot of pressure tonight, one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6521.965s">Um,</a>  we're the, we're the ones that are trying to figure out the best way to go here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6526.507s">And</a>  it is very upsetting how much we need a new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6531.549s">And</a>  obviously now know the concerns of the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6534.574s">and</a>  this is still being pushed down our throat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6538.056s">I</a>  don't know how I will vote if the questions move forward, but I think three months of multiple working groups, that be it the fire department, the police department, the administration, with the city council, with the people, with the taxpayers and the citizens of this community, I believe if everybody puts their heads together, we can figure out a way to rule out or continue on with a dual facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6564.252s">In</a>  a few months after cost analysis is done, Mr. McKillop is exactly right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6569.82s">What</a>  are the cost analysis? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6571.362s">We</a>  don't have any. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6573.024s">We</a>  were given five days before we could even ask any questions, and we were asked to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6578.972s">Now,</a>  thankfully, we've got two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6580.634s">We've</a>  got some breakdowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6582.165s">We've</a>  got some questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6584.166s">We</a>  still don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6584.926s">I</a>  think it was Councilor Scarpelli last night that asked, what other locations were looked at? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6591.249s">We</a>  can't be told until those property owners are discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6594.671s">That's</a>  something we should know before we take this vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6597.852s">And</a>  I know it's not what the police department wants to hear, nor should they have to hear it, because it has been too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6604.155s">But</a>  that's the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6605.075s">That's</a>  the way this council should be moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6609.705s">for</a>  the benefit of the whole community and what is right, and for us to be completely 100% educated on a financial decision that is going to impact us for 30 to 39 years that our children will be paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6626.969s">So</a>  I'm going to move that we take three months to create multiple working groups, and we get started tomorrow to figure out the right way to do this.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6649.388s">Chief.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6650.608s">Mr.</a>  President, Leo Sacco, chief, chief of police. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6653.329s">Uh,</a>  I just want to make a couple of comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6656.991s">So</a>  basically one major comment with regard to the grants, everyone's talking about all the grants that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6663.633s">I</a>  can tell you that been chief now a little over 26 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6668.855s">And</a>  a couple of weeks ago, I told you for the past 20 years, we needed a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6674.297s">I</a>  can tell you at least once a week, I've been scouring, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6678.403s">different</a>  areas looking for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6680.805s">No</a>  money was left on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6682.586s">There</a>  has been no money, whether at the federal level or the state level, for brick and mortar construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6688.55s">Absolutely</a>  nothing, because they believe that's a local issue that should be dealt with locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6694.454s">Malden,</a>  to the best of my understanding, received money because they relocated their police station to Eastern Avenue, the further end of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6704.762s">And</a>  it's, I guess it's labeled as a redevelopment zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6708.064s">So</a>  they receive redevelopment money for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6711.465s">We</a>  don't have such an area, or at least I don't think we have such an area in our city, but I don't want anyone, people have come up to the podium and talked about grants and money left on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6720.409s">I</a>  don't want the public to think that the city of Medford was negligent and not looking for funding sources because if it was out there, we would have nailed it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6728.653s">Ladies</a>  in the back, please have respect for the chief on the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6732.135s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6733.382s">That's</a>  all I wanted to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6734.322s">I</a>  just want to make sure the record is straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6736.403s">We</a>  have looked for grants for the, at least the past 20 years for a police station, either through block grants or through federal government, through the state and to private entities for grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6746.807s">There</a>  has been nothing out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6748.988s">So</a>  no money was left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6750.648s">If</a>  there was, if it was out there, we would have been looking for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=6753.63s">Thank</a>  you, chief.</p>

    <p>[Eddie Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7303.146s">Walter</a>  Buckley, Vice President, Local 1032, 340 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7308.53s">I</a>  just want to thank the councilors that were in favor of at least taking the two weeks to consider and answer some questions that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7317.555s">Unfortunately,</a>  it didn't come out in our favor tonight, but we want to thank you who put the time and effort into answering our questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7326.181s">And</a>  that's all I got. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7328.443s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7357.622s">This</a>  paper is in regards to Tufts University notifying the city of Medford of all their students that are living in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7367.926s">And</a>  the address is and how many people are living in each apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7372.708s">So</a>  if there are any code violations that our code enforcement officer will be able to rectify them so we don't have any further tragedies going forward like we had seven years ago.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7386.35s">Well</a>  said, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7387.811s">If</a>  I could, I want to thank the Ad Hoc Education Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7391.632s">I</a>  think it was chaired by Councilor Falco, Councilor Cohen, and Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7398.675s">They</a>  did yeoman's work in an issue that's been lingering in this community for a number of years, and one that has an impact on neighborhoods that abut, in particular, Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7413.903s">The</a>  issues that are involved, Mr. President, this is not gonna solve all the issues, but as was mentioned in the subcommittee meeting, it's gonna be another tool in the toolbox to allow our code enforcement officers to be proactive in some cases and reactive in other cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7433.613s">So</a>  I see this as a good step forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7437.035s">As</a>  I stated at the meeting, Mr. President, I think we need something citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7442.358s">And</a>  this is an issue that impacts every segment of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7447.401s">We</a>  have illegal basement apartments, illegal attic apartments, and at some point it's a quality of life issue in all our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7456.986s">So</a>  I'm thankful of the subcommittee's work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7460.408s">I'm</a>  thankful for the neighbors that showed up at each of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7464.288s">to</a>  express their opinions on this very issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7468.33s">And</a>  I'm thankful that we now have a tool like Somerville in Boston that will allow us to not only safeguard neighborhoods and the quality of life in a neighborhood, but also, Mr. President, safeguard the students that are living within these apartments, Mr. President, that landlords don't have any care regarding the number of people they're trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7493.12s">cram</a>  into an apartment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7494.901s">Uh,</a>  so I look forward to the implementation of this and eventual use as a, an effective tool for, uh, the neighbors of salt method in the hillside area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7506.771s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7507.291s">Mr.</a>  Clark, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7511.354s">I'll</a>  be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7512.115s">I</a>  just want to thank my subcommittee members as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7514.396s">And,</a>  uh, the committee as a whole, because at some point this did go to committee as a whole as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7519.26s">And</a>  there were a lot of great questions that were asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7522.04s">and</a>  just thank the City Solicitor Rumley and John Babuso, our Code Enforcement Officer as well, but also to thank the neighbors that showed up to the meetings, that attended the meetings, and that there are some neighbors that are here tonight that just want to assure that this gets through, and I'm confident that it will, and I think that, like Councilor Mark said, this is another tool that the, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7546.588s">that</a>  the code enforcement officer has to keep our neighborhoods safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7550.91s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7552.131s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7552.991s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7554.012s">Mr.</a>  President, I think it's also important to point out the work of Barbara Rubel and Rocco DiRico and their work with the council in ensuring that this is an ordinance that is going to be operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7563.116s">So</a>  I'd like to thank the work of the Tufts University Community Affairs Office, especially Mr. DiRico, who's here in the audience this evening.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7569.78s">A</a>  lot of work was done by a lot of people on this very good mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7573.101s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7611.284s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7613.325s">Some</a>  of these questions were answered last night during our Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7617.227s">It</a>  looks like Donovan Sweeney was paid $150 an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7621.229s">They</a>  estimated less than $10,000 has been spent <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7627.97s">for</a>  their services thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7629.63s">So</a>  if we could just get the only question now that needs to be answered is where did that $10,000, what account or which line item did that $10,000 come from?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7638.132s">Okay,</a>  on the motion by Councilor Lockern, that we find out where the $10,000, what account the $10,000 came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7646.615s">Although,</a>  do we have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7650.435s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7651.696s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7652.396s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7671.959s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7674.3s">Apparently</a>  this quarter it's my turn to bring this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7677.303s">I</a>  think one of us at one time or another have taken the opportunity to bring this resolution forward and request that the Massachusetts Highway Department, MassDOT, come down and beautify the retaining wall <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7688.338s">along</a>  Roosevelt Circle, which is right now plagued with very pretty pink graffiti. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7693.081s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues support me in sending a correspondence to MassDOT requesting that that issue be resolved.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7698.865s">And</a>  if we could maybe send it to Councilor, Representative Donato, that is his district, for his help. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7705.43s">Seconded.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7706.931s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Alango-Kern. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7709.252s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7749.536s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd like to amend the paper and request that the Massachusetts Highway Department submit to the Medford City Council a maintenance schedule for the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7756.201s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7775.686s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7777.347s">As</a>  the Council and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinances begins its discussion on zoning, one of the concerns that's been raised is the <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7785.041s">number</a>  of commercial and industrial parcels that are coming off the rolls with residential development and the city's future ability to provide an equitable tax shift from the residential tax burden to the commercial and industrial properties, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7798.832s">So</a>  with that being said, there are certain streets in the vicinity of large commercial developments, such as the Meadowglen Mall, Linden Street being one, that is a dead-end street that abuts the private property of the Meadowglen Mall site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7810.481s">And</a>  I'm asking the city solicitor, with the support of this council hopefully, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7814.153s">To</a>  provide us with an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a thruway for the purpose of future examination of developing a strong commercial or industrial based district down there for tax revenue purposes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7826.947s">We've</a>  talked with some of the neighbors in the area, some of the residents and property owners on the street, and it's something that they've expressed concern about for a number of years in terms of making Linden Street a thruway. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7837.144s">Also,</a>  currently, at the present time, there is a construction fence that is up at the end of the dead-end roadway, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7845.768s">And</a>  in previous years past, due to the involvement and efforts of Fire Chief McCabe at the time, there was a breakaway fence that was put there for public safety purposes so that if there was ever a situation where fire trucks could not enter Linden Street from the Riverside Ave side of the property, they would be able to do so through the abutting property of Meadowland Mall, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7865.296s">So</a>  I'd ask that this paper be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7866.517s">I'd</a>  ask my council colleagues to support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7868.039s">And</a>  as we move forward, I look forward to updating you with any information that we receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7871.162s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7872.263s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7873.043s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7873.744s">President</a>  Caraviello, I don't mind getting an opinion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7876.927s">I</a>  just do want to point out there are neighbors that have reached out to me within the last week, curious why this was on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7884.093s">And</a>  they're, you know, I don't know if they're necessarily opposed to it, but they had very grave concerns of opening up Linden Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7891.766s">I</a>  just wanted to point that out, and an opinion is fine, but whether or not we do it, I definitely think it's something that we need to get that whole neighborhood involved with before we move forward on anything.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7902.032s">Councilor</a>  Nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7902.793s">I'd</a>  certainly make myself readily available to any constituent that has a question about a piece of paper or legislation that I've put forward, so they're always more than welcome to contact me directly as well, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7913.219s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7914.24s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Nice, as seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7919.883s">The</a>  motion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7922.357s">Be</a>  it resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a through way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7929.962s">There's</a>  currently a gate at the end because it will go on to private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7936.466s">There's</a>  a fire gate which the fire department has the keys to. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7943.55s">Whether</a>  that gate can come down and that public street can go on to private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7952.6s">No,</a>  we're just asking for an opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7955.102s">An</a>  opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7959.266s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7961.047s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight is seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7964.33s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7966.292s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7968.333s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7970.595s">17-090</a>  offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7973.178s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council request <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7976.407s">a</a>  cost estimate for the repointing of the wall and replacement of the wrought iron gates at Royal Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7982.93s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7984.131s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7985.471s">It's</a>  been brought to my attention that the gates down at Royal Park were removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7989.893s">And</a>  the reason that they were removed was because for a number of years they were not being utilized as open and closed as often as they have been in recent past. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=7998.858s">The</a>  infrastructure wasn't able to sustain the ongoing use. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8002.7s">I</a>  believe the, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8004.221s">gates</a>  were put up sometime in the 20s according to some of the research that Mr. Lincoln and the friends of the Royal House and the slave quarters have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8010.546s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, there were innate gates that did serve a purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8014.889s">I</a>  feel as though it's something that should go back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8017.431s">I</a>  feel as though the rotating wall surrounding Royal Park is in disrepair at this point in time and a cost estimate as to what it would take to repoint the brick wall and put up the wrought iron gates is the subject matter of this resolution.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8029.96s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8030.461s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8033.435s">I'll</a>  yield to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8034.475s">Councilor</a>  Feckel, we yield to the gentleman at the podium.</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8038.097s">Thank</a>  you, Tom Lincoln. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8039.838s">I'm</a>  the executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8043.539s">We've</a>  been a neighbor of the park for well over 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8046.901s">It</a>  wasn't there then, but sometimes it feels like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8050.142s">In</a>  fact, I believe the park was actually either given or sold to the city of Medford in the 1920s as part of the royal estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8057.125s">We</a>  get a lot of visitors from out of town that come to Medford to visit the Royal House and Slave Quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8063.046s">I</a>  had a few comments about the state of the gates in the park, and we'd certainly like to see this done, and we greatly appreciate Councilor Knight's resolution along these lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8074.333s">You</a>  may recall, just as a piece of this, that there was an auto accident on the main street side of the park sometime in the last 10 years, I would guess, which caused a lot of damage, and that was repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8087.662s">But</a>  the masonry, including the low base of some of the wall, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8092.615s">on</a>  the George Street side is not in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8094.776s">In</a>  addition, we share a common border, a common boundary with the park, a mixed masonry and historic wooden fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8105.679s">And</a>  we've actually had some discussion previously with the DPW and the city about working on that, which we intend to revisit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8117.862s">We'd</a>  be delighted, as neighbours, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8121.407s">sort</a>  of historic co-owners, shall we say, to see some progress on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8126.609s">I'm</a>  sure the gates, I assume the gates have been stored someplace and could be put up, but I had not realized that the state of the masonry was the main reason that they were removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8138.293s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8140.014s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8140.894s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8141.734s">Mr.</a>  Lincoln, if I can ask you a quick question, just because while we're on the topic of the royal house, um, you know, it's, it's a historic, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8150.142s">It's</a>  something that people drive by, and it's part of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8154.686s">And</a>  it's been here for hundreds of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8159.111s">But</a>  if you drive by at night, you never know it was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8161.213s">So</a>  my question is, has there ever been lighting in the front? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8165.517s">Because</a>  I don't know if there has. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8170.207s">Is</a>  there any thought of actually reinstalling lighting or putting lighting in so people can see it at night?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8174.951s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8175.892s">I</a>  know this question was raised earlier, and I think I sent a letter to the council about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8179.875s">I</a>  think Jay Griffin actually was here about it a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8183.358s">Is</a>  that possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8186.5s">At</a>  one time, we had what's called architectural lighting on our property to light up the facade of the main building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8194.326s">There</a>  was also a light on the slave quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8197.298s">On</a>  the slave quarters, we provided other lighting, more like security lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8202.079s">In</a>  fact, we have another problem with the lantern actually on George Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8207.38s">Some</a>  of this conduit, et cetera, was installed many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8212.141s">Since</a>  that time, the lighting failed on the facade, but in this period, the whole practice for historic monuments, like National Historic Landmarks, which this is, which is the highest category of historic <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8226.85s">protection</a>  in the United States have changed, the technology has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8233.393s">At</a>  this point, we don't feel we can, two things, we're struggling with, struggling is too strong a word, we're debating about what to do, if anything, on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8242.658s">Of</a>  course, the building is set way back from the Main Street side, and so that you need a lot of lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8252.943s">And,</a>  you know, the cost of that, the aesthetics, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8257.107s">There's</a>  some debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8258.828s">One</a>  of the co-presidents, Peter Gittleman of the Royal House Board, actually manages 36 buildings for historic New England. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8267.992s">They</a>  have the Otis House downtown, and they've had a lot of issues involving architectural lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8276.575s">And</a>  I think that's become, it's an issue in the rather rarefied world of historic <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8284.141s">properties.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8284.721s">We've</a>  made other improvements on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8287.583s">If</a>  you haven't been there for a while, the front entrance has been, we've added an accessible pathway, repaved a long section from the sidewalk up to the slave quarters entrance, and we've done other work on the grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8307.953s">It's</a>  often said in the historic preservation business, at least <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8311.461s">with</a>  18th century buildings, these buildings are almost 300 years old at this point, that you might be better off digging a hole in the ground and shoveling $100 bills in terms of the costs of maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8324.492s">But</a>  rest assured, it's something that we're thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8326.754s">It's</a>  not my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8327.694s">I'm</a>  merely the administrator in terms of further lighting there.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8334.08s">Do</a>  you know if, has anybody taken a look at what that would cost?</p>

    <p>[Tom Lincoln]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8339.337s">We</a>  don't have a cost estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8341.438s">We've</a>  been playing catch-up ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8343.119s">We</a>  redid the decorative fence last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8345.46s">We</a>  need to work on the fence between the royal house and the park, as I mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8350.022s">We've</a>  replaced two restrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8354.143s">We've</a>  done a lot of plumbing, a lot of electrical upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8357.725s">Construction</a>  in old buildings with these very high standards is very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8362.647s">So</a>  I don't have an estimate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8364.608s">It</a>  would involve a new conduit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8368.542s">And</a>  then the tricky part, as I understand it, and I'm no expert on the technology, is what kind of lights, how far away they are, what they get you in efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8380.048s">The</a>  lights we had there were the low sodium, which are incredibly inefficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8387.191s">And</a>  in fact, the bulbs are like $75 now, and they don't last long. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8393.134s">But</a>  the problem is that the conduit is shot, so there's not even any power. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8396.7s">So</a>  it's, it's on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8398.14s">We</a>  have, we have a fairly long list of, of interior and exterior, uh, maintenance and, and restoration, uh, items.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8406.843s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8407.183s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8407.463s">Thank</a>  you for your hard work.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8541.447s">I'm</a>  not sure which one, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8542.948s">I</a>  think that would go to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8546.009s">So</a>  if you would like to refer that there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8547.789s">I'd</a>  like to refer that there, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8549.43s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8550.19s">On</a>  the motion by, uh, counseling by President Caraviello, all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8554.991s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8557.251s">Offered</a>  by President Caraviello and Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its consolances and have a moment of silence to the family of Anna Consolino on her recent passing after a long illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8570.134s">Uh,</a>  if you're from West Medford, anyone, anyone who knows Anna Consolino, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8575.038s">She</a>  was a fixture in that square for many, many years, and she passed away last week after a lengthy illness. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8581.986s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8583.448s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could, I grew up with the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8587.768s">in</a>  West Medford, and the Consolino's name is synonymous with West Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8594.149s">The</a>  ARCO service station was in business under Dick Consolino for 61 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8600.831s">And</a>  that service station was a landmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8603.751s">And</a>  every time I drive by and see a bank there, I just, I don't even recognize the area anymore, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8611.213s">But</a>  Anna Consolino will solely be missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8614.351s">And</a>  she was a terrific mother and grandmother and a loving wife and a tremendous business person for a lot of people in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8623.917s">When</a>  you brought your car down there and you didn't have the funds to pay, Mr. President, the Consolinos would say, don't worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8629.521s">When</a>  you have the money, give it to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8631.642s">And</a>  that just doesn't happen in this day and age anymore.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8633.904s">I,</a>  being a longtime customer, my dad was a customer of the Consolinos and good people, good family.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8841.906s">Mr.</a>  President, if we could, I believe last year this council made a recommendation that the poll workers that are so diligent and do a great job in the city elections be fed because they're spending 13 hours <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8855.658s">In</a>  some locations, because of the lack of personnel, it's tough for people to get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8861.722s">And</a>  I would ask, once again, if the city clerk would be so kind to make sure the poll workers get some type of bagged lunch or pizza or something, Mr. President, to show our appreciation for the effort that they put in.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8973.418s">Mr.</a>  President, I think I'm not sure if it was you or one of the other councils offered a resolution to have many of the plaques on our veteran memorials to be refurbished. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8983.543s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8983.943s">Have</a>  we got any response regarding the plaques?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8986.444s">We</a>  have not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8988.365s">I've</a>  spoken to the Veterans Service Office, and I think that's a funding issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8992.007s">Some</a>  of the plaques are old and they're tin. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8996.733s">And</a>  I have talked to some people who do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=8998.594s">They're</a>  unsure if they can even be redone again because of the age and the wear of them.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9005.617s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9005.837s">So</a>  if we can't refurbish them, we have to replace them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9007.878s">I</a>  would hope that the mayor would appropriate some funds to get that done.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9013.301s">Well,</a>  I would ask that that be part of your paper also, Mr. President, that we get an update on the refurbishment of the plaques.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9018.824s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if we could add that onto the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9020.265s">If</a>  we could look at adding some additional funds to get some of the older plaques. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9025.631s">while</a>  the city cleaned and replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9035.437s">All</a>  those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9041.722s">17</a>  0 9 1 petition by Jean Martin, 10 coming street, Medford mess to address the council on not erasing Medford's history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9051.728s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9079.12s">inaccurate</a>  and harmful as it denies our legacy in reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9083.422s">Medford</a>  was discovered as a, discovered in quotes, as a result of the Sprague brothers finding the existing footpaths of the Indian inhabitants from Salem to Charlestown in 1629. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9096.55s">They</a>  crossed the Saugus Plains into Malden and then to the edge of the Middlesex Fells all the way to what would become Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9104.814s">The</a>  square is a result of the continued use of this area <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9108.665s">as</a>  it was the narrowest point in the river at low tide for crossing over, as originally used by the Indian population. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9117.53s">Just</a>  on the other side was another Indian footpath up to present day Winter Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9123.213s">And</a>  from there, the Sprague brothers continued down to Charlestown. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9127.436s">In</a>  1630, the governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, Matthew Craddock, London merchant and dedicated Puritan, formed his own peculiar plantation <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9139.912s">which</a>  became our city today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9142.714s">It</a>  was seen as peculiar because unlike Cambridge, it was not set up as a town but a private plantation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9150.699s">The</a>  original people whose land started to be taken away from them by these English intruders were known as the Pawtuckets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9160.065s">That</a>  was the name of the native tribe, the Pawtuckets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9162.947s">A</a>  man named Sagamore John was chief of the Pawtuckets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9166.628s">Sagamore</a>  John and his people died of smallpox in 1633. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9171.37s">In</a>  1644, the Indians remaining in Massachusetts put themselves under the English government. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9179.752s">Once</a>  there had been about 20,000 Indians within 50 miles of Plymouth alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9185.014s">By</a>  the close of the century, there were only about 4,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9189.375s">We</a>  know that by the 18th century, not all residents were free. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9193.757s">And</a>  that's in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9195.461s">Blacks,</a>  Indians, and forgive me for using the term mulattos, that is what is written in the history book that I got this from. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9202.364s">It's</a>  called Medford on the Mystic, and it was by Carl Seberg, who lived in West Medford on Madison Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9207.267s">I</a>  knew him because I took care of his aunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9209.648s">Amazing</a>  man. <a

these servants were held in slavery. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9221.514s">In</a>  a census of Negro slaves in <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9224.026s">Massachusetts</a>  in 1755, there were 34 slaves over the age of 16 living in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9231.651s">27</a>  were men and seven were women. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9234.614s">By</a>  1764, the slave population in Medford had increased to 49. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9243.84s">And</a>  in case you were wondering if Northern slavery was any better than Southern slavery, think again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9248.844s">Medford</a>  selectmen, Medford selectmen, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9251.27s">In</a>  1734, voted, quote, all Negro, Indian, and mulatto servants that are found abroad without leave and not on their master's business shall be taken up and whipped 10 stripes on their naked body by any freeholder of the town and be carried to that respective master's. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9270.156s">And</a>  said master's shall be obligated to pay the sum of 2S6D in money to said person that shall do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9280.304s">Slavery</a>  existed in Medford until 1787, when in the case of the Commonwealth versus Jennison, this institution was finally outlawed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9290.911s">Our</a>  nation was not founded on the, quote, fundamental principle that all persons are entitled to equal protection under law, unquote. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9297.515s">The</a>  Declaration of Independence, paragraph two, when Thomas Jefferson wrote, quote, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9307.312s">He</a>  currently owned 175 black slaves, including five of his own children, by Sally Hemings, who was herself his property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9314.978s">Even</a>  at the time of his death, he only freed the slaves of his bloodline, and Hemings herself still remained in bondage to another relative. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9323.645s">The</a>  document's prime author, Jefferson, was clearly speaking only on behalf of a white class. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9329.77s">In</a>  one of the complaints Jefferson charged the King of England in the Declaration of Independence, paragraph 29, quote, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9337.028s">meaning</a>  the king, has excited insurrection amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguishable destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9354.053s">Clearly,</a>  Jefferson was not including quote, Indian diversity, as a result of himself, as equal as to himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9362.916s">And</a>  furthermore, it could actually be argued that women as sexes, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9366.874s">were</a>  to be protected by the white man from the Indian, which, again, involves non-equality with the Native American. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9378.143s">The</a>  Constitution of the United States, Article I, Section 2, Paragraph 3 states, representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included within the union according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9396.08s">of</a>  free persons, this is in the Constitution of the United States and this is in the Declaration of Independence, our founding documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9403.922s">Just</a>  wanted to let you know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9405.942s">The</a>  number of free persons included those bound to service for a term of years and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all persons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9417.925s">In</a>  the Federalist Papers, Madison expressed the Southerner's own conflict between his self-interest <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9423.088s">and</a>  having his slaves counted as persons for the purpose of the numbers of representatives in Congress, quote, one representative for every 30,000, unquote, due to the South's low rural white population comparative to the northern states and the incongruent concept that slaves were solely property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9442.146s">The</a>  two concepts required mental gymnastics. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9444.883s">as</a>  they also used northern and southern women to argue in favor of using slaves in their census by suggesting that states already counted women who are also without suffrage in their census for the purpose of representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9460.126s">Northerners</a>  are just as guilty, for they had just as much self-interest in denying slaves as persons for the same reason, congressional representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9470.768s">Northerners,</a>  through Madison, stated, all this is admitted <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9474.327s">It</a>  will perhaps be said, but does it follow from an admission of the numbers for the measure of representation or of slaves combined with free citizens as a ratio of taxation? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9486.329s">That</a>  slaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9490.21s">Slaves</a>  are considered as property, not as persons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9494.491s">This</a>  was the Northern argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9496.931s">They</a>  ought, therefore, to be comprehended in estimates of taxation, which are founded on property. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9503.146s">and</a>  to be excluded from the representation which is regulated by a census of persons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9509.171s">Indians</a>  not taxed means that some Indians were taxed, which I infer to indicate that some Indians were still enslaved peoples at the time of this writing of the US Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9521.121s">In</a>  either case of our founding, does the white man view either the African slave or the Indian as persons entitled to the equal protection under law? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9532.575s">Article</a>  1, Section 8, Paragraph 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9536.636s">To</a>  regulate commerce in foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9541.978s">Explanation,</a>  Madison states that, quote, the regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations of the Articles of Confederation, which render the provision obscure and contradictory. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9558.783s">The</a>  power is their restraint to Indians, again, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9562.455s">The</a>  power is there restrained to Indians, not members of any of the states, and not to violate or infringe the legislative right, meaning US legislative right, not the Indians' rights, of any state within its own limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9577.299s">What</a>  description of Indians are to be deemed members of a state is not yet settled and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils and how the trade with Indians <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9591.618s">Though</a>  not members of a state, so the Indians were not considered members of the state, yet resided within its legislative jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9602.664s">Without</a>  so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation is absolutely incomprehensible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9608.347s">Article</a>  1, section 9, paragraph 1, quote, the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9618.5s">shall</a>  not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9624.722s">But</a>  a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding $10 for each person. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9632.124s">Madison's</a>  papers, in short, compromised with southern state leaders in order to grandfather out slavery by stopping its international trade starting in 1808, 20 years after the signing of the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9647.68s">Article</a>  4, Section 2, Paragraph 2 and 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9651.861s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9655.001s">Well,</a>  I do find this history lesson very entertaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9657.202s">I'm</a>  having trouble connecting its pertinence to the deliberations of the Medford City Council at the current time.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9662.703s">I</a>  will get that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9663.743s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9665.764s">This</a>  is evidence that the mayor's statement that you guys signed off on is inaccurate in its statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9672.745s">When</a>  you say that this country was founded on <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9679.162s">equal</a>  protection under law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9680.203s">It's</a>  absolutely not right, and it's inaccurate, and it's harmful, and I'm gonna argue that point in a minute too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9689.011s">Okay,</a>  and entertaining, no, but it should be educational. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9693.856s">A</a>  person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime who shall flee from justice and be found in another state shall, on demand of the executioner, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9704.91s">executive</a>  authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up to be removed to the state having jurisdiction over the crime.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9715.073s">I'm</a>  almost done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9715.693s">You're</a>  coming up on your 10 minutes.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9716.773s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9717.533s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9719.654s">No</a>  person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered upon <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9735.005s">claim</a>  of the party to whom such service or labor may be due, which is used to justify the fugitive slave law. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9742.151s">Here</a>  I come into my argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9743.212s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9744.713s">In</a>  conclusion, your political worldview, and that includes you guys because you signed off on it, does a disservice to the city by erasing its history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9753.76s">It</a>  ignores the brutal historic context that both Native Americans and African Americans have had to live under in our economic and political system throughout our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9762.883s">which</a>  denied their basic humanity and collective legitimate grievances. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9766.525s">This</a>  country still lives with the legacy of the racially motivated slaughter of Native Americans and human bondage of African Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9779.972s">Again,</a>  respect for diversity is not an original concept of the founders. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9784.394s">It</a>  is my belief that you have adopted this concept of diversity because it is politically advantageous to all the new groups coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9791.688s">to</a>  the city, including women, gays, people of color, races. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9796.191s">While</a>  I applaud your intent to include diversity, I cannot allow you to exclude the hard, cruel facts of our founding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9803.315s">And</a>  I do recognize that some of other racial groups and religious groups have faced discrimination. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9808.338s">Nothing</a>  comes close to these two collective experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9811.28s">Erasing</a>  history as it actually happened contributes to not only the pain and suffering of the two primary racial groups here described, but denies them reasonable mitigation <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9821.608s">for</a>  the institutional legacy we are required by conscience to assist in resolving. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9827.372s">Therefore,</a>  the city needs to retract that diversity statement and rewrite it in a way that reflects their reality, not comforts yours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9836.118s">And</a>  I would say in all, one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9839.6s">When</a>  you point a finger at somebody, you're pointing three back at yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9842.382s">But</a>  somebody else told me, a wise woman told me, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9844.763s">If</a>  you have a criticism, you should have three responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9847.704s">So</a>  I, I will help rewrite this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9851.065s">That's</a>  what I'm saying.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9851.885s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9856.447s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9856.767s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9859.968s">Joe</a>  Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9863.069s">I</a>  want to thank Jean Martin because she helps us not be doomed to repeat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9869.831s">Erasing</a>  Medford history is key and I thank her. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9874.348s">for</a>  bringing that information to the public here at the People's Forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9878.952s">The</a>  etch-a-sketch history of a city not documenting room 207 meetings is exactly bringing that point into the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9891.202s">This</a>  city council works very hard in those room 207 meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9894.525s">Now,</a>  I took a video with my camera to preserve Medford history because this is history tonight, the last day of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9904.292s">2017,</a>  this is history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9907.754s">We're</a>  doomed to repeat it if we don't document and study and analyze what goes on in room 2207, if we don't tape our athletic events, our cooking shows, Wright's Pond, fiction and nonfiction in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9924.463s">We</a>  don't have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9926.704s">And</a>  Gene's absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9928.725s">When</a>  there's a state of the city address and the people here <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9933.607s">didn't</a>  seem diverse, it seems like a polarized city, that should be documented. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9938.668s">It</a>  should be on public access TV. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9940.889s">And</a>  I appreciate the Councilors that are respectful and listen to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9943.849s">Martin,</a>  because she worked hard on that paper, and I appreciate it, and I think she did a great job tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9950.471s">But</a>  Room 207 is sometimes like an executive session at a board meeting, where people are excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9957.192s">An</a>  open meeting law should include documenting important history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9961.403s">And</a>  the citizens of Medford want to know what's going on with our fire department, with our police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9967.966s">As</a>  we found out tonight, this room was packed very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9973.288s">How</a>  do we preserve Medford history? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9976.129s">Those</a>  being paid $30,000 a year need to sit in their seats and listen to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9981.132s">One</a>  Councilor was rustling papers, cleaning up a desk while Jean was talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9984.593s">That</a>  was very disrespectful because she pays his salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9989.042s">Clank</a>  clangs the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9990.323s">Councilor</a>  Penta speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9991.964s">One</a>  Councilor shutting doors and getting water. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9994.405s">Very</a>  disrespectful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=9995.606s">We</a>  do not preserve our history by futzing around and being disrespectful and then demanding respect, demanding respect when you don't earn it, but you take out $30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=10007.294s">So</a>  Jean, it would be great when we get a TV station, let's take your essay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=10013.438s">Let's</a>  get the kids of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=10015.859s">Let's</a>  get the seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=10017.372s">to</a>  speak into the camera and preserve our history. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=10021.194s">Those</a>  who don't preserve it are doomed to repeat if they don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=10025.715s">Thank</a>  you, City Council of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=10028.677s">Have</a>  a good end of February.</p>
