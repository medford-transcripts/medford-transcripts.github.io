    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1012.85s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1014.771s">This</a>  is something that I've put on the council agenda before, probably three, four years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1021.714s">And</a>  it's something we discuss and bring up usually every budget season, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1028.659s">And</a>  in light of what's gone on in the last several weeks especially, I believe that we truly need somebody qualified to help us write grants, to help our department heads write grants, to be able to tap into the funding that is out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1044.131s">We</a>  saw and we've been discussing grants for police stations and other facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1050.385s">We</a>  just saw our neighbor Malden get $9.8 million in a grant, which is approximately half of the new build for their police station that just was opened in the last couple months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1064.368s">There's</a>  also other possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1066.209s">I</a>  know that we could start off by getting a mentor, somebody to help the people here at City Hall that do write an occasional grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1074.591s">We</a>  are lucky and have good department heads that will write a grant here and there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1079.423s">But</a>  they're not dedicated full-time grant writers, and I think we're missing out on something that can be so beneficial and pay for itself tenfold, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1091.231s">It's</a>  just something that I think the city needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1094.454s">Also,</a>  grant mentor, I was given some information today from a resident who said that the service co-ops of retired executives make mentors available. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1102.78s">So</a>  in the meantime, while we're exploring the possibility of <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1106.632s">hiring,</a>  whether it be a part-time or full-time grant writer, there are mentors out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1110.733s">And</a>  these are the things that the city needs to tap into so that we could do more projects and more projects that are needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1119.455s">We</a>  could be able to spend more of our general fund on maintenance and things that obviously we sometimes fall short on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1127.877s">So</a>  I would ask for a roll call vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1130.158s">And</a>  we really look into this to get a grant writer and put it in the next budget, if not sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1135.199s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1473.1s">So</a>  Mr. President, if we could just ask, typically, in your opinion, what does this add to the overall cost of a project? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1483.562s">Are</a>  we looking at, is there an industry standard? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1486.663s">Is</a>  there an additional 10%, 20% that you add on to a cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1490.784s">Or</a>  has that already been considered?</p>

    <p>[Jeff Shaw]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1494.43s">The</a>  project as was conceived already has a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1497.852s">It</a>  considers the site costs at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1501.113s">The</a>  actual configuration and how the site is dealt with during construction would be done at that later date when the design is completed.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1511.537s">So</a>  potentially there could be a request for additional funding if need be?</p>

    <p>[Jeff Shaw]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1518.22s">I</a>  don't think I can answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1519.68s">I</a>  think it takes into consideration a hypothetical. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1524.022s">information</a>  about.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1525.303s">Well,</a>  the fact that it's on a floodplain is not hypothetical.</p>

    <p>[Jeff Shaw]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1528.385s">The</a>  fact that it's located in a sign haven't been determined yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1532.588s">I</a>  don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1535.11s">I</a>  don't know exactly if there would be any consideration of additional costs because we haven't done the actual design. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1542.295s">So</a>  there may be none. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1543.816s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1544.576s">We,</a>  we, we heard just the president last night that, uh, you know, money's tight in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1550.133s">And</a>  the only reason why we bring this up is that if there is an additional cost, I think we should know it ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1556.016s">Uh,</a>  so that, that's the only reason why I ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1558.418s">And</a>  I don't know if council along with current already made a recommendation, but I think we need to know, and maybe they have to do some more homework on it, but if there is additional cost because of the property being located in a floodplain, uh, according to, uh, our own energy and environment office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1575.228s">So</a>  I'd make that part of the report.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1576.709s">If</a>  council, I don't think for the city engineer, the,</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1639.401s">The</a>  motion is to send it to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1641.341s">I</a>  would like that withdrawn so we can get an update first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1644.882s">This</a>  isn't something that can linger in committee for months and months. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1648.303s">I</a>  mean, we have eight months.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1649.083s">Then</a>  it would be incumbent upon the committee to meet and to request the pertinent information that's necessary to make an informed, you know, to get the questions answered as soon as possible and request any information that they like.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1658.044s">To</a>  get the pertinent information?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1659.064s">I</a>  would like to get this information, meet, <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1663.099s">with</a>  the information and then ask additional questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1665.96s">There's</a>  no reason why we have to delay it two, three, four weeks to even refer the questions out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1672.463s">We're</a>  being rushed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1673.844s">This</a>  is being shoved down our throat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1675.544s">We</a>  have questions that need to be answered, and this should be answered first before we send it to committee in a month or two, whenever we decide to meet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1684.848s">So</a>  I'd ask for a roll call vote on my resolution to get an update.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1690.733s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Wong-Tam to get an update on the flood plain conditions.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1697.555s">From</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1698.275s">Alicia</a>  Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1700.055s">I</a>  know there's a committee working on it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1704.716s">I</a>  believe there was a committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1706.697s">I'm</a>  not exactly sure when it was scheduled for but it was pretty recent and this was information that was divulged. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1714.119s">We</a>  just would like her written opinion on it and to know more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1718.68s">I</a>  wasn't at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2hZdDePQb_Y&t=1720.322s">I</a>  don't exactly know when it was, but it's information that we need as soon as possible, not in a few months.</p>
