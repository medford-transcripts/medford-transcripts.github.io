I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. On the motion by Councilor Marks for suspension of the rules so that we can present a citation to Reverend Noah Evans.

3
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:34,795
Welcome to City Council. You've been here many times. For those of you who don't know, for the last nine years, Reverend Noah Evans has been the pastor of the Grace Episcopal Church. On March 5th will be the last Sunday Mass for Noah Evans at the church. Reverend Noah will be moving to Mount Lebanon Episcopal Church. The Reverend has been an integral part of our community and has helped build relationships

4
00:07:35,335 --> 00:08:03,348
of support to many in our community. Reverend, you have been a positive spiritual presence for everyone in the city of Medford and have been an inspiration to all who have known you. Today, we want to say thank you for how you walked in truth, for how you shared God's word, salvation, life, and for each soul you renewed. Thank you for the time you have spent and the hours you have gladly gave to our community in unfolding

5
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:31,023
of God's perfect way at Medford. The residents of Medford wish you and your family the best and hope you have more wonderful opportunities on the road ahead. We will miss you, but in more ways than you'll know. We thank you and we owe you a great debt of gratitude. Your presence in our community is going to be missed more than you know. Reverend.

6
00:08:42,717 --> 00:09:11,371
I think before we give you a citation, I think maybe some of our counselors may want to give you a couple of words. Counselor Marks, would you like to start out with something for the Reverend? Thank you, Mr. President. As you mentioned so eloquently, Reverend Noah has been an integral part of this community and has been a voice of reason. He was at the council meeting, I don't know, maybe a month ago or so in representing

7
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:40,177
issues of concern in this community. And I know his shoes are going to be sorely missed in our community. And I wish you well in your new endeavor. And if you ever need anything, give us a call. Thank you. Councilor DelaRusso. Mr. President, thank you. Reverend Noah, it's been a pleasure working with you over these years and an honor to work with you in your parish and to minister alongside of you.

8
00:09:40,548 --> 00:09:55,229
as we both walk people through the darkest moments of their life. I know the skill set that you have. I know the concern that you have, not only for the people of the parish, but also in the greater community in the outreach you've done.

9
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:20,710
in the urban centers of this area for the poor. So I wish you well. I know you have a great task before you to minister to the people of Pittsburgh, and I wish you, your wife, and your children well. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Duda. Councilor Falco. Reverend Owens, thank you for all that you've done for our community throughout the years. You have

10
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:50,562
been a big part of just leading the interfaith group within our community, all churches, Catholic, Protestant, Episcopalian. And I know you brought that group together like it's never been before in our community. And that's meant a lot. And I wish you well in your future endeavors. And on a personal note, I know my in-laws belong to the Episcopal church. And when my father-in-law passed away,

11
00:10:51,018 --> 00:11:20,482
with him to the end, and that meant a lot to our family. And I thank you for everything that you've done on a personal note and for our community. Thank you. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much, and Father Noah, thank you very much as well. You've been a great next-door neighbor. I've lived next door to the Grace Church now for a number of years, and I've certainly seen the parish grow under Father Evans' leadership. You've done a great job here in the community, and we really can't thank you enough for the efforts that you put forward in building social capital

12
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:46,604
creating an engaged citizenry with the parishioners. So thank you very much, Father Evans. You're going to be sadly missed. But I'd ask that even though you're down there in Pittsburgh, you still pray for us up here in Medford. Thank you very much. Thank you. Councilor Lungo-Kern. Thank you, President Caravaglio. I just want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues. You've done great work in Medford, and we're going to sorely miss you. Best of luck in your future. Thank you. Councilor Scarpelli. Again.

13
00:11:47,077 --> 00:12:15,713
I echo what my colleagues have said, Reverend Noah. Your vision and your leadership within our community is going to be sorely missed. I just, something they all missed. I just hope that you remember that you left a Patriots fan and hopefully you don't become a Stalers fan. So, thank you very much and God bless. Thank you. Solicitor Rumley. Thank you. Reverend Noah, I speak to you tonight just briefly and as a friend.

14
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:39,980
And I only want to say one particular thing, that there's a quality of Christianity that you exhibit so well. And it's one that I've observed over all the times that we've been together in the past years. And that is, you are genuine and authentic, and I've been blessed to know you. Thank you. Thank you. At this point, it gives me great pleasure

15
00:12:40,503 --> 00:13:09,477
to present this citation to Reverend Noah Evans. The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Noah Evans, Rector, Grace Episcopal Church, in recognition of your leadership to the members of the Grace Episcopal Church and to the community of the city of Medford. Since your arrival in 2008, the Grace Episcopal Church has seen 50% growth in attendance, significant growth in stewardship, growth in the Children's Center,

16
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:39,008
in the completion of a major capital campaign in the building project at the parish. You've restarted the Protestant chaplaincy at Tufts University and have been a leader in the Medford Conversation project, as well as spearheaded green improvements throughout the parish. It is with great pleasure that the Medford City Council rises up to join you and your family and friends on this remarkable milestone. On the behalf of the citizens of the city of Medford, we wish you good fortune on your new home as rector

17
00:13:39,295 --> 00:14:08,624
at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Mount Lebanon, the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It has been such a blessing to be able to serve both at Grace Church and be able to serve with you all in the city of Medford.

18
00:14:08,843 --> 00:14:35,371
I've learned so much from this city and the way that you're committed to your life together and working things out and living in the diversity of this community and moving this changing community forward. I really truly believe that Medford is a beacon to the world of a way for people to live together, especially a diverse people to live together. And thank you for all of your leadership.

19
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:44,416
all of your leadership in that. It's been an honor. Thank you.

20
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:45,520
Oops.

21
00:15:46,972 --> 00:16:10,073
Sorry, Rick. Here we are. Oh, that's a good shot. This is going to cost you $5, Cop Yellow. OK. Take it off my salary. Thank you very much. Good luck. Thank you. Have a good day. I hope that the parish can find someone that's as equal to you.

22
00:16:32,163 --> 00:17:01,373
Motion by Councilor DelaRusso to return to regular order of business. 17-084 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern. Be it resolved that the administration hire a full-time qualified grant writer. Councilor Langel-Kern. Thank you, President Carviello. This is something that I've put on the council agenda before, probably three, four years ago.

23
00:17:01,694 --> 00:17:30,095
And it's something we discuss and bring up usually every budget season, if not more. And in light of what's gone on in the last several weeks especially, I believe that we truly need somebody qualified to help us write grants, to help our department heads write grants, to be able to tap into the funding that is out there. We saw and we've been discussing grants for police stations and other facilities.

24
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:59,052
We just saw our neighbor Malden get $9.8 million in a grant, which is approximately half of the new build for their police station that just was opened in the last couple months. There's also other possibilities. I know that we could start off by getting a mentor, somebody to help the people here at City Hall that do write an occasional grant. We are lucky and have good department heads that will write a grant here and there.

25
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:26,002
But they're not dedicated full-time grant writers, and I think we're missing out on something that can be so beneficial and pay for itself tenfold, if not more. It's just something that I think the city needs. Also, grant mentor, I was given some information today from a resident who said that the service co-ops of retired executives make mentors available. So in the meantime, while we're exploring the possibility of

26
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:55,499
hiring, whether it be a part-time or full-time grant writer, there are mentors out there. And these are the things that the city needs to tap into so that we could do more projects and more projects that are needed. We could be able to spend more of our general fund on maintenance and things that obviously we sometimes fall short on. So I would ask for a roll call vote on this. And we really look into this to get a grant writer and put it in the next budget, if not sooner. Thank you.

27
00:18:56,343 --> 00:19:24,558
Councilor Knight. Mr. President, I feel as though this is a great resolution. I second Councilor Lungo's motion for approval. On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kern, seconded by Councilor Knight, a roll call vote has been requested. Councilor DelaRusso. Yes. Councilor Falcone. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Lungo-Kern. Yes. Vice President Marks. Yes. Councilor Scott Kelly. Yes.

28
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:52,250
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative. Motion passes. 17. Yes, Mr. Councilor Del Rosso. Second by Councilor Knight. 17-075.

29
00:19:54,477 --> 00:20:20,178
Loan order. Oh, okay, I'm sorry, wrong one. 17-018. Thank you. Committee of the whole meeting report from February 22nd, 2017 regarding the bond order for the police station. Councilor De La Rosa.

30
00:20:22,507 --> 00:20:49,186
We have met in great detail, not only last Wednesday, but last night. We received over the weekend of a number of responses as to questions that were sent to the administration. They've been answered. We had multiple opportunities for discussion, remonstration, and sharing of diverse opinions.

31
00:20:49,642 --> 00:21:07,546
Uh, Mr. President, uh, we've gotten our answers and a motion to, uh, as it was re uh, reported out of committee motion to adopt the committee report. I think a solicitor Romney Romley as a wants to make a statement. No.

32
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:40,047
I do have the mayor's communication that she had submitted to the council. Yes. I don't know if this would be the appropriate time with the reporting out of committee, but I think it would be assuming that other procedural things fall into place. Okay. Motion by Councilor DelaRusso that the committee report be adopted. Seconded by Councilor Knight. All those in favor? Aye. Motion. While we're under suspension. 17-086. 17-086.

33
00:21:41,043 --> 00:22:09,950
Offered by Councilor Lungo, Kern, and Mox, be it resolved that the Energy and Environmental Office update the Memphis City Council with regards to concerns they may have about 92 Main Street being on a flood plain. Councilor Lungo, Kern. Thank you, President Carvio. I just feel a couple of these resolutions. 90 Main Street. 92 Main. 90 Main Street. 90 Main.

34
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:33,305
I feel a couple of these resolutions probably come first. They're pertinent to I think something that will come in a little bit. It was brought to my attention that 90 Main Street is on a flood plain. I believe climate change in Medford, it's a group that's working on mapping out the city.

35
00:22:33,727 --> 00:23:03,325
finding future floodplain issues. They did detailed mapping, including air quality, heat gain, sea level rise, and the potential flooding of lots. And 90 Main Street is on that list of a potential floodplain. So I think it's just extremely important to get an update from our Energy and Environment Office. I'm not sure if our consultant can discuss whether or not that's on a floodplain. And I'm not sure if anybody's here to answer any questions, because I know that's pertinent

36
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:29,667
potential vote that may take place in a little bit. Thank you. Councilor Knight motion to refer to the subcommittee on environmental affairs. Mr. President. Second. Seconded by Councilor Dela Russo. All those, uh, all those in favor. Aye. Aye. You didn't push a button. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey, that's all right.

37
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:58,625
Mr. President, I concur with the sentiment of my colleague, Counsel Lungo Kern, and where we have the gentleman from Dunneman Sweeney, is it possible maybe if you can get up and explain if this would have an impact on the cost of the project itself? If he's not able to answer that, Mr. President, that's fine, but I'm just concerned that if this wasn't taken into consideration and if it needs to be taken into consideration. Mr. President?

38
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:26,384
Councilor Don Rosso. Also, do we need to be concerned that where it's on a floodplain, do we have to be concerned whether Route 16 and half of Medford Square will be swept away? I would hope that the gentleman maybe will have an answer for us. Thank you. Name and address of the record, please. Jeff Shaw, Donovan Sweeney, Architects on 16 J Street in Somerville. I can say that it's always going to be a consideration for any project going into construction.

39
00:24:26,738 --> 00:24:53,705
to take into consideration all of the environmental characteristics of the site. So Mr. President, if we could just ask, typically, in your opinion, what does this add to the overall cost of a project? Are we looking at, is there an industry standard? Is there an additional 10%, 20% that you add on to a cost? Or has that already been considered?

40
00:24:54,110 --> 00:25:23,742
The project as was conceived already has a budget. It considers the site costs at this point in time. The actual configuration and how the site is dealt with during construction would be done at that later date when the design is completed. So potentially there could be a request for additional funding if need be? I don't think I can answer that question. I think it takes into consideration a hypothetical.

41
00:25:23,962 --> 00:25:49,780
information about. Well, the fact that it's on a floodplain is not hypothetical. The fact that it's located in a sign haven't been determined yet. I don't understand. I don't know exactly if there would be any consideration of additional costs because we haven't done the actual design. So there may be none. Right. We, we, we heard just the president last night that, uh, you know, money's tight in this community.

42
00:25:50,033 --> 00:26:19,210
And the only reason why we bring this up is that if there is an additional cost, I think we should know it ahead of time. Uh, so that, that's the only reason why I ask. And I don't know if council along with current already made a recommendation, but I think we need to know, and maybe they have to do some more homework on it, but if there is additional cost because of the property being located in a floodplain, uh, according to, uh, our own energy and environment office. So I'd make that part of the report. If council, I don't think for the city engineer, the,

43
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:42,920
Well, the environmental office. Okay. Ed, do you have that? Refer to the environmental office? Councilor Lococo. Thank you. It may be pertinent to send into more to have more discussion in committee, but I think we need an update from our environment and energy environment office first. So if we could get,

44
00:26:44,050 --> 00:27:12,991
have the administration look into a cost, if it is on a floodplain, how much, obviously, Council Member Mox's amendment, but we need an update with regards to this before we meet in committee, so if we could maybe change that around, get an update, get cost estimates, figure out how much additional cost it's going to be, and get an update, and then we can put it into committee. I would ask my colleagues to get an update first.

45
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:42,505
Do you want to withdraw the motion? The motion is to send it to committee. I would like that withdrawn so we can get an update first. This isn't something that can linger in committee for months and months. I mean, we have eight months. Then it would be incumbent upon the committee to meet and to request the pertinent information that's necessary to make an informed, you know, to get the questions answered as soon as possible and request any information that they like. To get the pertinent information? I would like to get this information, meet,

46
00:27:43,079 --> 00:28:08,830
with the information and then ask additional questions. There's no reason why we have to delay it two, three, four weeks to even refer the questions out. We're being rushed. This is being shoved down our throat. We have questions that need to be answered, and this should be answered first before we send it to committee in a month or two, whenever we decide to meet. So I'd ask for a roll call vote on my resolution to get an update.

47
00:28:10,653 --> 00:28:39,880
On the motion by Councillor Wong-Tam to get an update on the flood plain conditions. From Ms. Alicia Hunt. I know there's a committee working on it right now. I believe there was a committee meeting. I'm not exactly sure when it was scheduled for but it was pretty recent and this was information that was divulged. We just would like her written opinion on it and to know more information. I wasn't at that meeting.

48
00:28:40,302 --> 00:29:07,792
I don't exactly know when it was, but it's information that we need as soon as possible, not in a few months. Okay. So your motion is to get an update from, from, from the office of environment and energy regards to the floodplain. And if there will be any additional costs regarding the product. Yes, please. On the second by council marks second by council marks, all those in favor roll call. Aye.

49
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:39,297
Roll call has been requested. Mr. Clark. So the motion to refer the committee is withdrawn. Yes. Oh no. We'll also go to committee also. We'll get an update from the engine from the city engineer table before the council at this point in time is to request the information and then have a subcommittee schedule so that they can be discussed. Okay. Roll call has been requested. Mr. Clark. Yes. Yes.

50
00:29:39,685 --> 00:30:08,930
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Seven in the affirmative. None negative motion passes. 17 0 8 7 offered by counselors. Longo Kern and vice-president of mocks. We have resolved that the city of Medford update the Memphis city council. We regard to who has been hired to be the OPM on this project manager for the, for the potential new building at 92 main street. Counselor Longo Kern.

51
00:30:10,837 --> 00:30:38,528
Yes, we could just get an update. I'm sure somebody would be able to answer this today. Who's going to be the owner's project manager? I believe that needs to be decided before we go out for architectural studies. Councilor Locks. Thank you, Mr. President. We have the mayor's staff here. Maybe they can enlighten us on who's going to be the OPM for this particular project.

52
00:30:40,283 --> 00:31:09,882
uh, Mark Romley city solicitor. It's not under my jurisdiction at all, but I can tell you this, that no one has been designated at this juncture. Is there a plan to designate someone? There has to be. It's required under the law for a project of this size. So, so it's required prior to any design. Is that correct? No, it is not. It's required during the design phase, which hasn't begun yet. So when is the design phase that well, once we get a loan order to pay for the design services, the architectural services. Okay.

53
00:31:10,186 --> 00:31:31,600
Because the way I read the law, it says that OPM has to be hired before the project designer. Okay, so we're on the same page. I think, yeah, we're pretty much on the same page. It's also concurrently. Okay. So if you want to use that synonym, that might work also. That's fine with me. Thank you. Name and address of the record, please. Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street, Medford, Mass.

54
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:55,850
I actually have in front of me from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the Office of Administration and Finance for the Division of Capital Asset Management, the Owner's Project Manager Guidelines for Mass General Law, Chapter 149, Section 44A 1⁄2. I'd like to read it, just to be clear. Effective on July 19, 2004,

55
00:31:56,238 --> 00:32:07,628
Chapter 193 of the Acts of 2004 inserted a new provision into Mass General Law 14944, which governs public building procurement.

56
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:37,784
The new provision requires public awarding authorities to engage the services of an owner's project manager on all building projects estimated to cost $1.5 million or more. The law requires that the owner's project manager, also known as the OPM, be hired before the project designer, meet required minimal qualification standards, and be selected through a qualifications-based selection process.

57
00:32:37,784 --> 00:33:04,700
The OPM acts as the awarding authority's agent and consultant throughout the project from the design through completion and must be completely independent from the designer, general contractor, and any subcontractors involved in the projects at all times. The law provides a listing of the minimally required duties of the OPM as follows. And I'll just read this and then I'll stop.

58
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:28,156
The duties of the owner's project manager shall include, but need not be limited to, providing advice and consultation with respect to design, value engineering, scope of work, cost estimating, general contractor and subcontractor prequalifications pursuant to 44D.5 or 44D.75 where applicable.

59
00:33:29,523 --> 00:33:48,642
scheduling, construction, the selection, negotiation with oversight of a designer, and as a control standards for monitoring performance of the building project and assisting in project evaluation, including but not limited to written evaluation of the performance of the design professional.

60
00:33:49,047 --> 00:34:18,443
contractors and subcontractors. And attached to this seven-page document, it outlines what the OPM is required to do by law and what you can ask them to do. According to this law, your OPM should have been hired before you even engaged with the architect. And I can give that to you so you guys can see it. Thank you. Thank you. On the motion.

61
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:41,545
On the motion by Councilor Langley-Curran, seconded by Councilor Martins. So we ask that we be apprised of who the OPM is once the selection is made. That is correct. Yes. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. Mr. President, while we're on suspension. Yes. Can we take the paper off the table? And which one would you like that to be? I would like that paper to be

62
00:34:42,119 --> 00:35:10,722
On the motion of Councilor Del Rosso to take paper 17075 off the table. Councilor Del Rosso. Present. Motion to approve. Motion to approve by Councilor Del Rosso.

63
00:35:12,933 --> 00:35:41,114
seconded by Councilor Knight. All those in favor? Roll call vote is required. Mr. Clark. Mr. We have, uh, the only update I have is whatever you received from the mayor this, this afternoon. Taking out of it. It's asking to take its first reading. Yes.

64
00:35:41,603 --> 00:36:00,942
Councilor Lococo. Okay. So that's a motion for approval. Okay. Of the paper. Um, no, I just didn't know if we had any updates from anybody before we take that vote. The only update you have is whatever the mayor sent you earlier today. And I think the people should be apprised of it. Thank you.

65
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:27,487
Name and address of the record. Hello, Brian, president of local 10 32 officer three 40 Salem street. Uh, I was just coming up here. Counselors that, uh, we'd like this, this paper read aloud. Um, that, uh, okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council, Mark Rumley city solicitor. I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

66
00:36:27,993 --> 00:36:52,546
The communication that the council received late this afternoon or early this evening, I have with me tonight. The mayor has asked that I read it because not everybody has received a copy, and that would give them the information of what's included. And it is to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council. Dear Mr. President and councilors, this month,

67
00:36:52,934 --> 00:37:20,153
I have put before the city council my request for a loan order to finance the cost of architectural services for a new police station at 90 main street. I consider this long overdue effort to be one of which we can all be proud. Concurrently, I have heard the concerns of the Medford firefighters about their training facility and fire headquarters on main street. With this in mind,

68
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:49,769
I have met with representatives of the fire department and have given them my commitment to address their concerns. And as I said last night, my commitment will be more than words, it is action. The action to which I commit is as follows. One, I will appoint a working group of fire personnel to assess appropriate sites for the construction of a new fire station slash headquarters and fire training tower.

69
00:37:50,832 --> 00:38:19,587
The amount of $500,000 will be appropriated for the construction of a fire training tower. The sites to be reviewed will include, but not be limited to, the current headquarters. Number two, the working group will submit a written report to the mayor 18 months after it commences its assessment. Its report will primarily include its recommendation as to preferred sites,

70
00:38:19,874 --> 00:38:48,983
for the construction of a new fire station slash headquarters. It shall also recommend a site for a fire training tower. Number three. After the mayor receives the recommendations of the working group, the mayor will seek cost estimates for the construction of the new fire station slash headquarters and fire training tower. Number four. The mayor will submit a loan order to request

71
00:38:49,321 --> 00:39:17,232
of the city council to finance the costs of architectural services for a new fire station slash headquarters no later than the end of fiscal year 2019 provided the working group meets all the above deadlines and requirements. I am proud to make this commitment. I consider it the best way to serve those who serve us so well, the members of our police and fire departments.

72
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:44,671
respectfully submitted, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor. Thank you. Thank you, Solicitor Rumley. Councilor Lungo-Kern. Thank you, President Carviello. We did meet a couple hours last night with regards to some just some additional questions. I'm not sure. I treasure, if you could come up, Ms. Irwin. We had requested just the numbers of that break-even point of where

73
00:39:45,025 --> 00:40:12,228
where we would have to possibly do, you know, an override. And you said you'd provide those to us today. Was it? I did. I did get a handout to the clerk's office today. So hopefully you received that. I didn't see that. It has a legal sheet on the back.

74
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:45,455
So if you could maybe just break this down for us. Sure. I, as I, um, we talked about last night, the, uh, new growth and how we were going to be able to consider that in the future. I think Councillor Kern, you asked us to maybe do a 10 year average. And so what we did was I looked back starting in 2005, uh, through 2017 and the average new growth was about 1.1 million. Um, but,

75
00:40:45,860 --> 00:41:09,873
That factored in a couple of years that were really meager. 2005, I believe. In 2011, we had some really short new growth. So what we did going forward on the first page, if you look, is that we used 1.75 as a new growth number. And actually, you can see on page 3,

76
00:41:11,915 --> 00:41:35,472
that our levy of $105 million, just below that you'll see a 2.5 increase and then a new growth number of 1.75. And so that brings us to $4,378,000. And that continues all the way down through, let's see, FY, looks like FY 31, all the way down.

77
00:41:35,641 --> 00:42:01,240
So that number on the end there, 4378-373, is the amount of revenue that we'll be able to levy going forward. And so what we did was take that number, and then if you do look on the first sheet, you'll see that it's a little convoluted, but I think if you stay with me, you can follow it. The first column is personnel.

78
00:42:01,848 --> 00:42:29,185
And that is then followed by ordinary income, which is, I mean, revenue, which is just about everything, and then enterprise and debt. And so what we did was take personnel, and we increased that by 2% each fiscal year. We took out the insurance costs and multiplied those out at an 8% increase each year going forward.

79
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:58,244
So in the final column, you'll see that we have, in 2017, $3,475,000 worth of debt service. And going forward, as we get into the years where we'll start to pay back the architect and the police construction fees debt service, you'll see, on the right-hand side, that we will have an increase in our budget in FY

80
00:42:58,598 --> 00:43:27,505
18 of $4,020,000, excuse me, and we'll have a levy of $4,378,000. Are you following me? Am I making sense? And so that gives us $357,000 left. Now, if you follow that down, you're going to see that in 2020, we will be in a deficit of $998,000, which is going to require

81
00:43:28,045 --> 00:43:56,817
free cash to make those debt payments. Going beyond that, we level out for a while, and then when the schools are paid, and then on the final one, or the second to last one, you'll see that that includes a payment for a new fire station with the architect rolled into it. And so that brings us to a $6,454,000

82
00:43:57,121 --> 00:44:20,189
increase in our budget, but we'll get $5,204,000 in our levy, which will then again require an infusion of free cash. Okay. If I may ask questions of the chair. So this breakdown, I understand the breakdown. Is this just with regards to our police station or this is if we did both? You'll see at the bottom, um, in FY 25,

83
00:44:20,712 --> 00:44:49,552
there's a payment, which would essentially mean that the police would come online first, and then in five years, we would have the fire come online. A fire bond. In 2025? Yes. That would be the first debt service payment. OK. So in 2020, with just doing the police station, we're going to need to borrow from Free Cash to balance the budget. That's correct.

84
00:44:49,889 --> 00:45:13,075
But by you telling us that, that means we will not be able to put another bond on our books unless we were going to take more from free cash until 2021. Unless we had an infusion of more new growth. It would have to, you know, that these are just projections. These aren't, you know, hard and fast numbers, certainly. So we would have to see, you know, what happens in the next fiscal year.

85
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:43,113
Right. There'd never be enough new growth to sustain a library in between the police and the fire. No. Okay. I think I understand the breakdown. Vice president box. If I could, and thank you for providing this in my, my question last night was at what point, because,

86
00:45:43,417 --> 00:46:06,687
we were told if we were moving forward with the police headquarters, uh, there was no talk about any proposition two and a half override. It was only when we mentioned about combining police and fire headquarters, it was mentioned last night, well, we're going to need a proposition of a two and a half override to afford that. And my question was at what dollar amount triggers the two and a half override?

87
00:46:07,075 --> 00:46:33,485
And I thought that's what you were going to provide. Well, I can't give you the exact dollar amount. I can tell you that we would be, uh, with 1 million with the police station and a dual, uh, facility, we'd be at about two and a half million, uh, in the negative in 2018. And that would require an override because we, I don't know where else we would get it to pay for in the next 30 years, every year.

88
00:46:34,683 --> 00:47:00,164
So you're saying an additional $2 million every year if we were to build? A dual facility. A dual facility. Correct. And the need, based on the current $38 million you're talking? Yes. So if we were able to offset some of that with free cash, the $9 million in free cash, or if we were able to offset that with some grant funding, that would no longer be the case, correct?

89
00:47:00,265 --> 00:47:25,763
Well, I mean, those are scenarios that I can't give you a definite answer to that it would or would not require an override. Today, I can't say that. I can say fairly certainly that, you know, a $2.5 million deficit probably would require it because that's an ongoing debt that would be 30 years, it would be continuing, excuse me, for 30 years.

90
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:54,518
It's not a one-year thing where we could borrow free cash. And again, our free cash is our rainy day fund, our stabilization fund. We can't use it to pay debt service for 30 years. No, but you can use it in cases of public safety and needs that arise. Yes, and generally in cases where you're using it for a one-time fix or an emergency or something to that effect, but for debt service that's going to be

91
00:47:55,075 --> 00:48:24,320
uh, 30 years, you know, using free cash is, is, is not wise. And it's obviously not, not something we can afford to do. Right. So, so I guess my question is that, uh, we heard tonight from the mayor and her response. Um, so just so I understand, it appears that, uh, we're not looking for at least a payment. If we were eventually to go through with a new fire station, the first payment wouldn't come, uh, until,

92
00:48:24,995 --> 00:48:53,193
2025? Correct. And typically, how long does it take for us to pay off? When would the building be built in order for us to have a first payment? Well, it wouldn't necessarily mean when it's built, but when we go to bond. So we would get the architect first, then we would wait for the plans, and then we would do some cost estimates. And then we would go to bond based on your approval.

93
00:48:53,615 --> 00:49:22,572
And we would have a, you know, a payment probably about 18 months after we bond it. Right. So, so I'm just trying to figure out the time. So, so if, uh, we were to move forward with the proposal that was mentioned tonight, correct. And, uh, the firefighters got together with their group and the firefighters, uh, after their due diligence of 18 months, which puts us in what, 2019, um,

94
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:52,357
make their recommendations to the mayor. Correct. The mayor then moves forward as she stated within the paper that she will initiate another design. She would anticipate a loan order for another design for architectural fees. Correct. And that would take us how long roughly for the plans? I would say probably 10 months. Same as the police station. So close to a year. So that brings us to 2020 then we get that back and then we go out for an RFP once we get

95
00:49:52,981 --> 00:50:21,263
The design, which takes how long, roughly? I would say probably six months. Six months, so that's mid of 2020. And then what happens between the next five years? Is that when the building's built? Well, we have to prepare for building it, and provided all those things go into sync, yes. And then at some point, we would be here again asking for a bond.

96
00:50:21,837 --> 00:50:48,888
and we would do that borrowing based on the time frame. Ideally, we want the schools to be paid for before we can go forward on that project. So what was stated last night more or less is being stated again tonight that we're looking at 2025 before we see anything. No. Well, I don't believe so because we also, if we bond an architect,

97
00:50:49,208 --> 00:51:18,217
In 2019, excuse me, we have five years to repay that or roll that into a new construction bond. So we would obviously anticipate rolling that into a construction bond. So we would have to do that within a five-year period. And the goal is to get that done sooner rather than later, but not until the schools come offline. Right. So it seems like we can't afford this until 2025.

98
00:51:18,352 --> 00:51:43,141
No, we can start the project. We can't afford the debt service. We could probably even afford it in 2024 based on these numbers. But it would give us a little breathing room. If you see right here, we'll have excess of $329,000 in the year before. So if we take on that debt, it would probably be similar.

99
00:51:43,816 --> 00:52:05,872
Right. But, but it seems like, uh, from what I gathered last night, the city's trying to get away as far down the line as possible from the year 2020 when the police department comes online as a payment. Is that, is that not correct? You're trying to get as far away as possible to kind of as far away, but we're trying to absorb the costs of the police department and get back on our feet. And then the, uh,

100
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:32,804
I'm just trying to figure out for the firefighters when they could possibly, if everything works out perfect and we know it's not a perfect world, when they could possibly see a new fire station. That's all I'm trying to gather. And if it's 2025 or 2024, I don't know, but I think some type of timeline. Those are the dates that the debt service would be due. So when we bond,

101
00:52:33,091 --> 00:52:53,746
We don't make those debt service payments sometimes for a year or 18 months after. So it could come online before that. Is there any way we can get a timeline? I mean, is there any way we can get some type of time? Maybe the firefighters have this in their head already, but I'm trying to get my hands around it just to see.

102
00:52:54,067 --> 00:53:13,118
What the timeline is on this? The timeline shapes up as it goes along. As the mayor indicated in her letter, by FY19, if we bond an architect, we are on our way to building a fire station. And so once that starts, then there are obviously, you know,

103
00:53:13,253 --> 00:53:34,297
I can't tell you what those are, but once we bond it, then our debt service, we can roll it into another bond. There are other ways to look at it. I realize what you're saying. My only concern is that 2019 and 2024 and 2025 is a big difference. That's a five-year span.

104
00:53:34,786 --> 00:54:02,714
So, and I don't think the process takes that long, to be quite honest. And it may not. It may not. I've been here through the building of the new schools. I've been here through the DPW. I've been here under a lot of projects, and it seems like a long time. And I just want to fight. And it may not. We want to avoid escalation costs. We're not going to start and get architectural services and get cost estimates and then wait three years. We're just going to lose money on that. You want to wait so we don't have to go towards Proposition 2.5, correct?

105
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:32,347
Well, we can't do that in 2017 is what I'm talking about. No, but I mean even 2020. 2020 is going to be a tough year, yes. If the process was sped up, just say the process weren't perfect. In 2020, would we be able to go out for a bond with a new fire station? No. No, OK. So that's what I'm getting at. So we're looking down the line for a purpose. We're not looking at 2025. That's when our debt service

106
00:54:32,718 --> 00:55:01,304
becomes due. Right. So it might be the year before that. I understand. Right. So I understand your situation where you're saying there's a big time gap between 2019 and 2024. There's five years there. Right. That is not necessarily how it's all going to happen. I mean, when you're at the end of fiscal 19, you're going to move right into fiscal 20. You're already in fiscal 20. That's the year that we have to get through. And we would still be waiting for architectural services

107
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:31,493
to do their plans and to come back to us and have cost estimates and do RFPs and then decide how much we're going to spend and how we're going to pay for it. And then we would start the bonding process. But remember, it's 2017. We already kicked the can to 2019 saying this is when their recommendation is going to come out. So we've already bought ourselves almost two years. So it sounds, it just sounds like a real lengthy process. I just want the firefighters to know

108
00:55:31,882 --> 00:55:59,472
when we could eventually see a building and having a timeline, just a sketch of a draft saying, this is the timeline. We look to get back the firefighters proposal, this, you know, 2019 and May of 2019. Shortly after that, the Bay is gonna go out for an architectural design in June of 2019. Then we're gonna get back and review this for six months. I'm sure you could put that together. That doesn't seem like,

109
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:26,708
complex. As I said there are a lot of factors that go into that and you know the mayor's had conversations regarding this and she's eager to get this headquarters built or fire station built. We just have to be patient with regard to our debt and that's all I can tell you. I know she's eager but we're equally as eager. Everybody is eager and as I said the longer we go the escalation costs are greater

110
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:51,447
And it doesn't behoove us to, would there are other projects that are going to want to come online? We, and I agree with that. I was prepared to vote on a combined center last week, so I don't want to wait another day, but, but needless to say, that doesn't seem to be the druthers of the administration. So all I want to know is what, what is the timeline? If you don't have it tonight, I would ask that the administration provide us at least from myself would be very helpful to see a timeline.

111
00:56:51,700 --> 00:57:20,017
on when this is all going to take place. Well, I just gave you anticipated dates. I mean, you can extrapolate from there. I cannot guarantee you when we're going to have a ribbon cutting at a fire station. I don't want to guarantee, but I think the firefighters should have an idea if it's 2024 or if it's 2027. I think they should have an idea. Well, I mean, clearly, we've factored it in as a debt service payment for 2025, which means that it would be bonded sometime in 2020.

112
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:32,842
21, 22 maybe, maybe 23. So you're looking at 24, 2024. For the building to open? For it to open?

113
00:57:33,196 --> 00:58:02,221
we have some type of, I, I, well, I, I'm not, I'm not the procurement person and I'm not the, um, I'm just trying to get it. I'm just trying to get a handle in. That's all. Right. And I, and I think we've, uh, you know, the mayor has worked with the firefighters to, to let them know how eager she is to have this happen as we all are. So, I mean, there's no, no, one's going to be dragging their feet in 2000 and 22. Um, about one of the clarification council among occurring.

114
00:58:02,592 --> 00:58:28,782
Even though nobody's dragging their feet and we're eager, you also just said we can't afford it till 2025. And when we can, we're still going to have to take $1,000,000.25 from free cash to do it. No, I said we couldn't afford, really, to do a dual facility. But your breakdown says we're still going to have to take almost $1,000,000.25 from free cash in 2025 when the fire station comes on the books. Right, and we could do that in 2024.

115
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:59,208
because the schools will no longer be online. That goes away, all that debt. Right, but I thought that was factored in and we still needed to take from free cash. We still will need to take from free cash because we have other borrowings. That's my, yeah. Thank you. Point of information, Councilor Knight. This is all assuming that we don't receive any outside funding sources, number one, and number two, that we don't also incur any acquisition, land acquisition costs to find a new facility.

116
00:59:00,676 --> 00:59:28,621
for to locate a new facility. If it's not in the existing facility, you know, there might be land acquisition costs as well. So it's going to be a dynamic and moving object. Yes. You all set another question. So, and, and, and I, and I appreciate all the information. If you could put together some type of timeline that that'd be very helpful. I'm sure the firefighters would like to see a timeline and I know it's not exact,

117
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:56,971
something that at least we can go by. I'd be happy to work with ShopCon, who's our procurement director, and with the mayor's office. That's great. Thank you. My other question, Mr. President, is regarding the advisory committee that's set up under this particular agreement. It is just consisting of all firefighter personnel. Is that correct? I don't believe so, no. I believe it's a working group that will be

118
00:59:57,376 --> 01:00:23,043
have mayoral appointees, and have appointees by the fire chief. So it says, I will appoint a working group of fire personnel. I think there will be people besides fire personnel on there. Yes. So do we know what it's going to consist of? Excuse me, Madam Treasurer.

119
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:50,060
I don't no one has been appointed yet but when I was speaking to the mayor today she talked about her conversations with the chief and the chief alluded to that last night that he was going to be providing her with some suggestions also and I know that she had also talked with the president of the union about that but there have been no names designated no I think if your question is if they are going to be exclusively Medford firefighters I think that certainly they're going to be represented to a significant and substantive degree

120
01:00:50,313 --> 01:01:09,280
But there could be other professional people that are engaged in not necessarily like fire departments and buildings and that sort of thing or the proper locations. There are all kinds of people that could lend relevant information to this. But the thrust of this and the substance of this

121
01:01:09,449 --> 01:01:28,484
is to have fire personnel on this working group. Even the numbers, I haven't heard what numbers they're going to be like, how many. So could we just reword that because when you read it, honestly ‑‑ I understand your sentiments, Councillor, and the reason we can't reword it is this is a statement of commitment by the mayor and I'm not authorized to change that wording.

122
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:55,703
under this commitment, the mayor is saying it's gonna exist solely of fire personnel. That's the way, I don't see how else you'd read that. You can define fire personnel as being members of the Medford Fire Department, and that certainly would be true, and you can also define it as fire professionals, perhaps who are retired, who are not on the active force, and those who have, right. So if we're going to get down to nuance, definitionally, what working group of fire personnel means, we could take some time with that,

123
01:01:55,973 --> 01:02:25,876
But I think that the honest truth is that this commitment indicates that the mayor is working with our immediate fire personnel, being the chief, and has talked to the union leadership about this. And I don't think anybody feels for one second that Medford fire personnel are not going to be a substantial part of this, but there's always the possibility there could be retirees or others who could lend their experience and talents to this. The only reason why I want to bring it up is because when the original proposal was made two weeks ago,

124
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:53,163
there was no input from, uh, the fire rank and fire personnel. There was no input from the rank and file police department. So I want to make sure now as this process goes along that at least we're, we're talking about a new fire headquarters that the fire department personnel be at the table. Yes. And I, and I think that's the only reason why I bring it up. Right. And I think those sentiments are prudent. I understand those, those sentiments and there is the mayoral commitment before the council this evening. Thank you.

125
01:02:55,323 --> 01:03:22,222
So Mr. President, just one of the, one of the question if I could. Um, so, uh, onto a council and I mentioned if, uh, this working group were to get together and decide that, uh, uh, they need a new fire station possibly, uh, behind here at city hall and a lot behind city hall and, uh, their training, uh, tower, uh, possibly in another section of the city on a private property that needs to be purchased.

126
01:03:22,762 --> 01:03:49,947
These factors will all be taken into consideration regarding the cost, correct? Correct. But the architect has a $10 million land acquisition line item in the proposal that he has if we were to build a dual facility on a new site. So obviously the $18 million price tag for the fire station at the current site would change if there were land acquisition costs.

127
01:03:51,128 --> 01:04:18,685
So the current cost of $38 million has a $10 million built in or no? No, that's what would be for dual site at the present site. But the larger one, which I think is 49 million includes a $10 million land acquisition fee. Okay. I don't remember seeing that one, but was that part of what we would give a part of the original one? 49 million. Yep. Thank you, Mr. President. Counselor Lungo Kern. Um,

128
01:04:19,006 --> 01:04:48,672
A few things with regards to, I know there's a number of requests and serious issues on the police side that need to be taken care of before this build out in two years. And I know that has been provided to the administration. So with regards to, is there any going to be anything done to the police station, current police station within the two year period to resolve those issues? And then on the same token, we have now nine years before

129
01:04:49,313 --> 01:05:16,280
you know, possible nine years before a new fire station is built. It'll be online before nine years. Well, 2017, 2025, eight, nine years. Yeah, but 2025 is again when a debt service payment would be made. So it could be two years before that. Point being, there's some serious concerns in station one on the fire side. What will we be doing for both departments in the meantime to make sure

130
01:05:17,242 --> 01:05:46,064
living conditions and working conditions are up to par, such as the mold and the asbestos and the building coming apart with rainwater coming in. I mean, some of the living conditions. Are we going to put any money into either department? And I don't know if it's a question for you, but I would have to defer to either the chief of staff or the city solicitor. Yeah, we can maybe get an idea on that, because not only that, but thankfully,

131
01:05:46,655 --> 01:06:15,848
If this all pans out, we have two years for the police, 789 for the fire department, and there's some, we discussed them last night, those issues I've already mentioned, plus the diesel trucks in with the kitchen, in with the equipment, you know, a number of different things that need to be addressed now. And I know, Chief, I know there's been a list given to the mayor. I don't know exactly what's on it, but when I walk in your station, I feel like it's unsafe for the officers that are in there.

132
01:06:16,203 --> 01:06:45,970
I mean, no bulletproof glass. I think maybe something's been put in recently, but not up to par. That concerns me. And we have two, two, two years before this is built. So on both sides, what are we, what are we, what is the city going to do? Name and address for the record, please. Jennifer Dever, chief of staff to Maybrook 85. George P has a tribe. Mr. President, if I may. Good evening all. Um, to address Councilor Curran's concerns relative to what is going to be done between now and then in respects to the firefighter, uh, to fire headquarters, um,

133
01:06:46,696 --> 01:07:16,548
the chief and I have an active dialogue in respects to any kind of needs or concerns that may happen, um, that will happen relative to the working conditions, much like we've had with chief Sacco relative to the cleanliness of the fire, cleanliness of the police headquarters, in addition to the replacement of the windows for bulletproof glass. So we will listen to, um, future concerns, current concerns, um, relative to the safety and the conditions of the fire.

134
01:07:16,818 --> 01:07:44,813
headquarters. Again, I'll state that we will work with the chief and we will work with the union as well to listen to these concerns and move forward much like we have, um, with chief Sacco. Thank you. Name and address of the record please. Leo Sacco, chief of police, uh, resided 227 Elm street in Medford. Uh, I've been authorized by the mayor to make the necessary corrections in the police department. Uh, but obviously we're not going to do anything that's going to be a budget break.

135
01:07:45,421 --> 01:08:14,311
Uh, one of the items that we need is, is a, uh, the female officers locker room facility and a shower facility. And, uh, the cost of that, putting that into an old building, uh, would be prohibitive would make any, any sense at all. So we have to make some minor modifications. There has been some bulletproof glass. I don't know if anything's really bulletproof, bullet resistant glass, uh, on the forefront windows that are on the outside and two of the lobby windows. And, uh,

136
01:08:14,817 --> 01:08:42,458
You know, that, that was something that the mayor probably could have waited if she, where she decided to move forward with a new station, but she didn't. She went ahead and authorized that purchase and it didn't come out of the police department budget. Uh, so things are being done to, to remedy the situation. Nothing's going to make it perfect. Uh, but definitely there's, there's, there was a cleanup over a couple of weekend periods and we need to continue the maintenance recently.

137
01:08:42,880 --> 01:09:11,416
the custodian that's been provided by the company has changed and is doing a much better job than what we've had in the past. So the place is a little more cleaner and that just a lot of work needs to be done and we're not going to spend a lot of money on, uh, we're not going to waste it, but the necessary repairs will be made. If I can, if I, thank you chief. Um, if I could add a B paper that, um, I know the asbestos was cleaned up in the police department side.

138
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:39,901
If we can add a B paper that mold testing and air quality testing be done on the fire department, I think that's extremely one of the major concerns. I mean, along with a whole list of others. But I think that's one of the major concerns that is causing potential or possible health conditions for our firefighters that needs to be addressed. I believe the asbestos in the mold has been remediation in the police department. And that's one of the so the fire department. Yes.

139
01:09:41,065 --> 01:09:59,122
I mean, it would be great to do it in both, but we know work has been done in the police department. We have two, you know, depending on this vote, I think it needs to be done in the fire department. It needs to be done in the first floor and the second floor. So if we can have that as a B paper. Name and address of the record, please.

140
01:09:59,459 --> 01:10:20,857
Gene Nuzzo, 35 Parish Street. I have a few points as they pertain to finance. We've talked a lot about Prop 2.5 and tripping Prop 2.5, but no one has mentioned at all the offset of the maintenance of the systems that are in place

141
01:10:20,857 --> 01:10:45,224
for the fire department if they wait another five years. I can't imagine that those costs will come down to continue to repair old equipment. So there also has to be an offset value on the operating side of the equation that I don't hear being factored in. I hear and I'm glad to hear

142
01:10:45,848 --> 01:11:06,554
that discussions are underway about additional maintenance to these facilities. But respectfully, the City of Medford does not do a good job at preventative maintenance anywhere. So our buildings wouldn't be in the conditions that they're in right now for fire and police, the two sides of these facilities.

143
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:32,660
if we had the proper preventative maintenance in place. So instead, we're doing these emergency repairs and these band-aid solutions, and they cost significantly more. So I'd be interested in hearing that. Additionally, with respect to finance, we're talking about $18 million with respect to the fire department getting a new facility at some point. I'm hearing five or so years.

144
01:11:33,503 --> 01:12:01,955
The escalation right now for construction sits at about 5%, and it's upticking since 2009, 2010. It was in the negatives then. It started to tick back up. And it looks like it's increasing about a percent, a half a percent, depending upon the year. So five today, next year, five and a half to six, et cetera. And that doesn't include if the current administration under

145
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:26,879
If President Trump passes anything to do with infrastructure, you're going to see those costs increase exponentially. So everyone's saying $18 million, but it's significantly more than that. So, again, I think there's a lot of complexities, and I respect that there are a lot of underlying issues that need to be addressed, but I think that also stresses the need

146
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:53,710
to really look at this overall. The other point I would make with respect to committees and work groups, I think it's pivotal and I'm glad to hear that the police will have representation among their membership as will fire. However, the mayor stood here last night and said it is potentially her intention to redevelop that property. So there should be some citizenry

147
01:12:54,132 --> 01:13:20,187
represented on that committee as well, because if that parcel is going to go up for redevelopment, voters and taxpayers should have a say as well. And right now we don't have a good venue to be involved. We have some other committees that do a good job, but we don't have a citizen development committee. So if there are people at the table, there should be some folks that represent the general population to talk about

148
01:13:20,558 --> 01:13:46,647
who and how they may redevelop that lot if the fire department moves. And the last point I wanted to make with respect to financing and schedule, in all of these conversations, these past few minutes, I've heard repeatedly about the architect, I've heard repeatedly about what construction's gonna be. I'm still not hearing anything about an OPM. And an OPM will be able to help you guys navigate

149
01:13:47,086 --> 01:14:13,040
will help to determine some value engineering and we'll put together that schedule you're looking for very quickly. So thank you for your time. Thank you. Counselor Dolo Russo. Move the question. We have citizens still willing to speak. Counselor name address of the record, please. David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. I just wanted to make a comment about the, um,

150
01:14:13,597 --> 01:14:35,247
cost of the dual facility. I heard $38 million for a dual facility, and I know it would take a couple of years, and then I heard that it would be $10 million to purchase property. My question is, is it up to $10 million? Because if you're moving the facility and going to another area, is it really $10 million to purchase a piece of property?

151
01:14:35,888 --> 01:15:00,374
offsetting that cost, wouldn't you be redeveloping or selling the property that exists currently? So really you're not looking at $38 million, I mean $49 million. You're looking at something that's much, much lower than what's being presented. And you won't know that until there's a cost analysis done on either the property you're currently in or both properties, the one that you're considering or the property

152
01:15:00,779 --> 01:15:29,652
or the property that you're in right now and the property that you're considering. Cause it just might offset, um, entirely and you're still back to the 38 million. So that's something to consider. When the clarification council, the administration's estimating 38 million if you stayed on site and then a potential up to 49 if we did not. So, correct. Yeah. But if you did not and you went to another area, are you, are you seriously paying $10 million for a piece of property? And if so,

153
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:52,838
is your property worth $10 million. So if your property is worth $5 million, wouldn't you purchase a piece of property worth $5 million? It would make sense. So you'd stay at the $38 million cost. That's number one. Number two, as far as the OPM, I've heard it a couple of times. Here's something that actually, if you read into this law, the Massachusetts law that was presented earlier, at the bottom of it, there is an addendum

154
01:15:53,429 --> 01:16:16,345
that basically clarifies the law allows a public agency to assign an existing employee to serve as its OPM provided that the designated employee meets or exceeds the minimum of qualifications set forth for retaining a private sector project manager and has experience in the construction and supervision of construction of building of similar size and scope of complexity

155
01:16:16,919 --> 01:16:46,872
as the project to which the existing employee would be assigned. I don't know if that helps you or not. But if you read into that, if there's somebody that is on board right now that has had that experience, you could probably bring them in as an interim until you find the OPM that you need to get this project going the way it should go. Because I think everybody in Medford would agree that this is something that is incredibly important. And we should have a state-of-the-art facility for both the firemen and the police. Thank you. Thank you.

156
01:16:47,412 --> 01:17:05,536
Councilor Marks. Mr. President, I was wondering if someone from the administration can clarify. We were talking about the dates when we could get a possible headquarters. Does the headquarters and the training tower have to come on board at the same time or

157
01:17:05,941 --> 01:17:35,017
Can the training tower be something that can quickly be arrived at, knowing that the nature of building a training tower is far less of an endeavor than building a headquarters? Is that something that? Yes. I'd be happy to address that, because the discussion that I had with the mayor, other members of the administration, and Jeff Shaw in the course of the last few days. Let's segregate out what you consider to be the lesser of the two, obviously, which is the training tower.

158
01:17:35,489 --> 01:18:04,295
Uh, that could be done separately from waiting for a new fire department that does not have to wait that period of time. So it's, it's clear that that, that while they have, that will both be under the domain of the working group, that their recommendations on a training tower could easily and well precede, uh, their later recommendations, which I would presume would be later on the fire, uh, fire headquarters slash station. Thank you. And Mr. Mr. President, maybe, uh,

159
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:31,109
uh, chief Gilberti can answer this question. Uh, we got, you know, we, we, we heard a lot tonight about the condition of the fire department. We know already the condition of the police department. Um, the fire department has a number of, uh, specialized, uh, equipment trucks. And, uh, if we're looking at a potential building in 2025 or 24, can you address a chief, uh, the need for additional space?

160
01:18:31,497 --> 01:18:59,003
We know the deplorable condition of the station, but the needs of the equipment needs and space is equally as important. Can you address what's gonna happen over the next eight years relative to the equipment? Are you asking me if we're gonna incorporate it into a new station, the additional space? No, storage need. We know even with the police department now, and that's one of the reasons, in addition to

161
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:26,611
the condition of the building, uh, the, the fact that these buildings are no longer suitable because they lack the storage for our, our, our equipment, what's going to be done in the meantime, there's about seven or eight years span. Well, if we have no way to put, I mean, we, we have to live with what we have. Okay. We're as cramped as can be. I'm storing it. I'm storing equipment outside today. So the plans out to,

162
01:19:26,864 --> 01:19:56,665
continue to store equipment outside? Where else can I put it? I mean... That's what I'm asking you. Where else can I put it? We put as much as inside as we can. And we're losing storage when we lose the training academy, correct? I will lose two bays over there that we keep reserve equipment in, yes. And the anticipation is that equipment's going to just be stored outside? No. No, we're going to have to find... We're going to have to either auction off some equipment, some older equipment, to make room.

163
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:20,425
So there's really been no thought process in what we're going to do with this storage need? I mean, we haven't talked to DPW. We haven't talked to even maybe- We have talked to the DPW. There's no room down at the DPW to store equipment. And that storage is all outside anyway. I can't store a fire engine outside in the wintertime.

164
01:20:20,948 --> 01:20:49,012
What about the private sector? Is it possible in some of the garages on Mystic Ave or Commercial Street? Oh, maybe that is a possibility, but we haven't explored that yet. Well, I think, Chief, the reason why I bring it up, I think it's an important issue because I think we're centered around the deplorable condition of the buildings, but equally we're moving forward because of the lack of storage within these both sides. Agreed. And that's equally an important issue. And as you know, you don't want to, we saw what happened to the DPW.

165
01:20:49,113 --> 01:21:18,239
They left there because their garages were leaking and so forth. They left their equipment outside. And vehicles that were purchased two and three years ago were becoming rusted and a whole other host of issues. And the last thing I want to see, even though our equipment needs something to desire in the fire department, as well as the police department, I'd hate to see this equipment being stored outside, this precious equipment that we have. So I'd like to at least get some feedback on what are the plans over the next seven or eight years.

166
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:46,201
Thank you, Chief. You're welcome. Thank you. Name and address of the record, please. Thank you, Council President Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts. I've said many times, if the city needs it, we should just get it done. What I don't understand is, however, the building is only 55 years old. It's brick and mortar.

167
01:21:46,387 --> 01:22:16,137
And now it's almost condemned. We have thousands of homes that are over 200 years old, and they seem to be in fine shape. How did this station or multiple buildings get to this situation? It seems like we have a maintenance problem for sure. Very sad. I'm now hearing the city's using new growth. We, the taxpayers, should get all that new growth.

168
01:22:16,508 --> 01:22:43,390
that new real estate tax to offset prop two and a half, or in this city it seems to be prop 2.49%. And give the middle class a break on the real estate, home real estate taxes. And now I'm here and talking about an override. It's never happened as far as I know in 02-155 Winchester.

169
01:22:44,133 --> 01:23:12,280
has had many Prop 2.5 overrides. But here, I don't think that would be a wise move against the real estate taxpayer. And I believe for every $20 million borrowed, it's going to cost us, the taxpayers, 50% more. It would be a $3 million bill in the 20-year payback. By the way, maintenance is still key. If anything is done,

170
01:23:14,845 --> 01:23:42,554
If I was in charge, I would make damn sure that so much is put aside for maintenance. Because the old high school on Forest Street will still be standing, and the new schools will turn to dust. Please adhere. Thank you for listening. Thank you, Mr. Castaneda. Mr. Penter, I think you cut in front of that young lady. No, we agreed. Oh, OK.

171
01:23:42,976 --> 01:24:12,102
Name and address of the record, please. I wouldn't be that rude. Thank you, Mr. President. Good evening. My name is Robert Pinter. I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of the Saugus party. I have some concerns as it relates to whatever this agreement might be between the city and the fire department. And the one glaring thing that stands out with me is that the mayor is going to appoint a committee of fire personnel to work as it relates to a new fire station or whatever it might be. Why didn't that take place for the police department?

172
01:24:12,828 --> 01:24:42,308
If she's so concerned about the fire department, it's obvious that she was less concerned about the police department. And it's quite obvious by this particular writing here. And it's more obvious because of the fact that no one from rank and file of the police union were part and parcel of where we're going with all of this. Second thing, as it relates to the location or relocation possibly of a new fire station, the chief is here. He can answer for himself. But last night, he indicated that the present location is the best place for the fire

173
01:24:42,612 --> 01:25:09,359
location here in the city of Medford for its headquarters. So we take that into consideration because the talk seems to be supposedly getting a new fire station at a new location at a later time. And then we go to point number four where the mayor says she's going to submit a loan order no later than the 2019 fiscal year. That brings you up to May of June of 2020, no later than that. But all you're going to be getting

174
01:25:09,578 --> 01:25:37,253
is allegedly a proposal for one, a new station. And number two, you know, maybe what the cost is going to be. There's no proviso in here as it's going to relate to how it's going to be paid for, whether it's going to be the Medford taxpayer, because we know right now there's no grants. She's still looking for grants. As she said last night, she's on the hunt. And in some places there's no grants to be found. So you're looking at Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer who seems to be the person that's going to be paying it.

175
01:25:37,996 --> 01:26:06,110
So I think you have some financial concerns that really need to be taken into consideration. Nothing that's been discussed right now is an obligation of the city. It's a, is it's approximate $28 million pension deficit. You folks haven't mentioned that yet. And there's no upticking on paying that down at a faster rate because the interest rates keep going higher. The other night there was a contract. There was a car, excuse me, there was a meeting as it relates to a multimillion dollar refurbishing of Medford high school.

176
01:26:06,802 --> 01:26:35,843
It's going to cost factor that's going to have to come in. Most recently, this council voted on, and excitedly, for the Medford Library and a $20 million bond. And if that comes through, there's a 40% payback on the city side. These are things that really have to be taken into consideration. And you, President Caviello, in your first term, on the second year of your first term, you introduced a document that talked about $1.3 million of necessary repairs on the six new schools. That's up to almost $1.5 million right now.

177
01:26:36,704 --> 01:27:06,050
This city has a bad history of taking care of its buildings. The private administration ignored all these buildings. This city council is now being faced with altogether, all at once, a whole host of issues. It's obvious that the priorities have not been set. But the priorities of this particular mayor, her little baby, being this police department thing, and now with the fire department thrown in, she should be here discussing this and making her plea with you folks. This is totally unfair.

178
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:31,801
You folks have never had an opportunity to discuss this issue, nevermind the location, nevermind the 35,000 square foot building, nevermind a three story building, nevermind the fact that if you put a combined operation there, according to Dunn and Sweeney, it won't even fit today's standards. And if you look at the 600 plus pages of the report, it alludes to the fact that even if you were to build a new police station and leave the fire station alone,

179
01:27:31,801 --> 01:27:57,890
what you're going to have is you're going to have mechanical problems that also will have code problems that will not bone up for the next 20 years. And that's going to be a cost factor to take into consideration. If you're talking about a possible 10 to 18 month period or 10 to 12 month period for a designer to come in and an OPM person hired first, everyone keeps forgetting to say that. The OPM needs to be hired first. Once you put that together,

180
01:27:58,683 --> 01:28:22,493
Why wait and do an 18-month period for the fire? Why can't you do both at the same time? And if you do both at the same time, maybe you can work out a process that basically says you can build this station in increments as it relates to building a new police station and then working on the fire station. Because we all know on the fire station side of the building, the building is probably in better shape and a better condition than the police side.

181
01:28:22,561 --> 01:28:50,945
But who's to say it isn't because nobody's gone through there and council logo hit it right in the head. Maybe you should go in there and have any equality. Maybe that building should be reviewed for his aesthetic qualities and whatever it might be. You know, running around, not having any money from the outside and only dealing with nine, approximately $9 million in your free cash. That doesn't leave, that doesn't leave an awful lot because then we can talk about your almost $8 million that you have in your water and sewer account for which Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer.

182
01:28:51,350 --> 01:29:15,160
has been paying for, and a surplus just sits there, and there is no ongoing proposed work. And you're hitting the taxpayers with that money. You're also hitting the taxpayer with the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, which in effect is almost $1 million plus you're taking away from the taxpayers, and there is no known program for it. So how much can you keep going back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and say to them,

183
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:38,667
We're charging you for this. This is what the cost is going to be. And readily acknowledged by our own treasurer, the fact of the matter is there's going to be some deficit mode as you continue to go forward that's going to have to be offset. Who's going to pay for it? Do you really want to tell the taxpayer you need a Proposition 2.5 override? Do you really want to sell that? And if everything comes before you, Mr. President, and before your council,

184
01:29:39,359 --> 01:30:00,892
Okay? Where's the conversation as it relates to that? Where's the priority going to be? Is it going to be the high school? Is it going to be the library? Is it going to be the police department? Is it going to be the fire station? The fire chief made an excellent point, something I never even thought of, and thank you for bringing it up. Talking about storage. If you can't even store what you have on the property that you have right now,

185
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:20,534
Where in God's creation are you going to put that? He said possibly auctioning it off. Two bays you're going to possibly be losing. You talked about regionalization the other night. The mayor readily said that we could possibly go to regionalization. And I believe we heard the fire department indicate and say to you that if we did go to regionalization and we did take one of our trucks and a group of our guys to go there,

186
01:30:20,534 --> 01:30:45,442
and to do whatever it might takes place at one of these fire academies, so to speak, there needs to be a backup here in the city. And where's the backup to the backup in the city? God forbid there's a major fire that takes place. These are things that haven't been discussed. That's what you folks should be discussing before you rush into this thing and say we want to go forward. There is nobody, not one person in this room that would be against a fire in the police station. I don't think there's anybody. It would all be crazy.

187
01:30:45,442 --> 01:31:14,585
if there was one person. We all recognize the fact that the need is there, but we also recognize the fact that the city has been extremely diligent in not maintaining its buildings. But there needs to be a priority that's set. There has to be a goal set here, and there has to be a timeline met. And if it's 2022 that was stated last night, now it's up to 2024 before you start to be making these paybacks, what's the cost going to be as it relates to the new station? Mr. McCulloch made an excellent point.

188
01:31:14,585 --> 01:31:42,648
And the point is simply this. If you have to buy another piece of property for $10 million, is the at-present property worth $10 million? Are thereabouts? And if it isn't, but it comes close to it, and between the sale and the taxes that it generates, it offsets the cost of where you might be going. These are things. And I thank you folks. I think it was you, Councilor Langel-Kern, who asked to maybe go into executive session to find out who are these other people that the city sat down and spoke with as it relates to possibly moving it around.

189
01:31:42,783 --> 01:32:05,918
You seem to forget one thing as it relates to where the public works department is, because we can't put any equipment in there. But the new public works building was being discussed. What was discussed before this council was building something that could be oversized, not only to handle public works, but to handle our other buildings, whether it be our fire trucks, our police cars, and whatever it might be. And there was a pushback by the then administration.

190
01:32:05,918 --> 01:32:31,822
Why there was a pushback, I don't know. And there was also a thought process that told us we could just wrap the whole thing around public works, fire, and police. And all you would be doing is asking and moving people that are presently there without taking their property, moving their property, so nobody would lose any space. As a matter of fact, they'd probably have better space, they'd have front view space, but you'd still have the availability of a fire department that's right there in the middle of the square.

191
01:32:31,822 --> 01:32:38,757
Police department, maybe move back a little bit one way or the other, but they can get around with their cars a lot quicker than a fire truck could.

192
01:32:39,230 --> 01:33:02,365
I don't think you should make a mistake by saying, no, we're not going to vote for this or yes, we're going to vote for that. It's the process. And once again, the process has been broken down. It's been broken down because there's been no communication, a lack of leadership from the mayor's office with this council. And all you folks are being required to do is to vote for this thing up and down with absolutely not an ounce of input.

193
01:33:02,534 --> 01:33:19,240
And today is another perfect example of what took place. If the fire department can meet with the mayor to get this resolution between themselves, then why wasn't the council involved before or after? And who's to say that this mayor is going to be here in 18 months?

194
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:40,638
That's the question. And that's what you need to ask yourself. So why are you going out on 18 months when in fact, if you're going to be doing this thing for a police department, why don't you do it for a fire department at the same time? That way they'll have a better understanding and a better acknowledgement to the fact where the fire and police can be housed together like they were in 1962 and like the report said.

195
01:33:40,638 --> 01:34:09,680
That report of multiple pages from Dunham and Sweeney going back to 2013 is probably the best example that you can have to tell you and to show you why a dual building should work. But if not, and you decide to go separately in a separate way, that generates and should generate positive discussion. And one last thing for Mr. Falco, Councilor Falco. When you talked about that training tower, while it seems to be something that, you know, it's going to be there and might cost $500,000,

196
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:38,232
But where in the city is it going to be? And you don't want that to be regionalized. Because if you want that regionalized, you're taking firefighters out of service, out of our community. You're taking a truck out of our service, out of our community. You're putting backup there, and there's nobody there for the backup. And that's the problem that we're going to have. Thank you. Thank you. Name and address for the record, please. Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street, Medford.

197
01:34:38,958 --> 01:35:08,371
I'm not here to criticize. I'm just here to express my opinion, my concern, and some amazement. We all understand that we have major decisions to be made and that major money is involved. I was a contracting officer for the federal government for 22 years. I dealt with from the architectural services to the completion of the building.

198
01:35:09,181 --> 01:35:36,603
I dealt with the new federal courthouse at Springfield, border stations, the Coast Guard building. And I feel every time I come here and I listen to what goes on, we don't understand, we have misinformation, we have lots of questions, and it's very difficult for me to understand why things are happening with the mayor, if you will, offside,

199
01:35:37,210 --> 01:36:01,696
and why you people most especially are being excluded. We hired you, voted for you, in essence hired you to represent us. And it seems like it is very unfair the way you are being treated. And when you are being asked to, two weeks ago or last week, I was watching it on television, it was like,

200
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:30,923
$2 million. You know, $2 million, like it's nothing. Property taxes have gone up, I think, 35 years in a row. And now, as I understood it, we definitely need the police station. We've needed it for like 20 years. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, comes we need the fire station. Well, I'm not disagreeing. But yikes, every time you turn around, there's this or that. Then the mayor has some kind of meeting.

201
01:36:31,345 --> 01:36:51,376
and something happens and the communication to me is just awful. And when you are being expected to vote on things, this is not the way things should be handled. The federal government wanted open, found that open government worked.

202
01:36:51,798 --> 01:37:09,685
and I would suggest that we need some of that in Medford because we, the taxpayers, are going to pay for this and we like it to work and you are being held responsible for things that I think it's just very poorly

203
01:37:09,685 --> 01:37:35,825
very poor management and I don't blame you. I just think there's all this cloak and dagger stuff going on that's really not right and it's really not fair. So I hope things get better for you because I hope things get better for us and things get a little bit better organized. Thank you. Thank you. Councillor Falco. Thank you Mr. President. I just wanted to go back to Mr. Petra's point about the

204
01:37:36,230 --> 01:38:04,529
regionalization of the tower. I'm not in favor of regionalizing the tower. The questions I had last night were just basically, what are the disadvantages of regionalizing the tower? That was it, but I want to keep the tower here. I think it's advantageous to us. I think our tower's the regional tower. Yeah, and it benefits our firefighters, so I mean, I want to keep the tower here. I just want to make that clear. Thank you. Thank you. On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, as seconded by Councilor Knight.

205
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:20,915
Name and address of the record, please. Bill O'Brien, present local 1032, office of 340 Salem Street. Councillor Marks, I just wanted to clarify something or have something clarified, is that you had a very good question of when the fire

206
01:38:21,877 --> 01:38:49,889
when the fire headquarters could be built. And I think that, you know, that wasn't the agreement that we, we worked out was that we're looking down the road for five years and not 2025 for a new fire station. Um, and if the, if the treasurer can have that information, I believe what our understanding was, we could go out to bond, um, and have a fire station in the city by 2023 it's physically, it's financially possible. Am I correct?

207
01:38:50,969 --> 01:39:20,922
If I may, yes. I think that there is a little sort of misunderstanding with regard to debt service versus ability to bond and start projects. And so that does need to be clarified, that I do believe that we would be able to have a fire station certainly underway. And I can't say when it would be completed, but 2023 would certainly be what was in the

208
01:39:21,479 --> 01:39:50,352
what was being planned, I would, I would think five years out and a debt service payment would be in 2025. So everyone's on the same page on that. Councilor Marks. And that's precisely why I asked for, for a timeframe because I wasn't privy to the meeting this afternoon between the union and the mayor. But it's clear to me that they weren't on the same page because from what I heard tonight,

209
01:39:50,588 --> 01:40:19,141
We're looking at more of 2024. But needless to say, Mr. President, you know, to get everything lined up and to make sure that we're working on a process now where one didn't exist the last two weeks is extremely important if we're going to move forward. So I think it's vital, Mr. President, that we get some type of timeline from the administration on this on this issue. So I don't know if you know, I'm prepared to make a vote tonight.

210
01:40:19,799 --> 01:40:39,256
I'll be quite frank, I am not happy, Mr. President, with the results that took place after today's meeting. I still feel strongly that a combined center is the fiscally prudent thing to do for this community. According to the $100,000 report,

211
01:40:39,593 --> 01:41:07,167
that we commissioned for feasibility study back in 2013 from Dunham and Sweeney for the Meffitt Police and Fire Station. They recommended a combined center. Also, the mayor's transition team that was put together by Mayor Burke, the Business and Economic Development Committee, held countless meetings, met with the general public, and their recommendation was to sell the land and build a combined center somewhere else.

212
01:41:07,167 --> 01:41:36,479
So clearly, Mr. President, we have not taken the recommendations of the mayor's transition team, and we have not taken the recommendations of $100,000 study that we commissioned, and we went off in a different direction, and with very little fanfare, very little input. So I am not happy, but again, as I told the union reps today that contacted me, I will not stand in the way, Mr. President, but I think clearly for everyone's sake, for the unions, for the taxpayers of this community,

213
01:41:36,648 --> 01:42:04,238
and for this council that we should have a timeline on this project. I can't state it enough, Mr. President, because I don't want tomorrow for the union to pick up the phone and say, you know what, we didn't realize this was going to take place because you know, if we vote on our first reading tonight, there's no, there's no going back. We understand that counselor. And we, we did talk, we talked at length about a timeline and it's spelled out. Now we can't,

214
01:42:04,627 --> 01:42:33,500
we can't predict about, you know, this fire personnel, the working group of fire personnel will be prepared in 18 months to make a recommendation to this, to the mayor of where a new head fire headquarters will go. We will be ready in 18 months. That's our timeline going forward. After the 18 months by fiscal year 19, which starts a fiscal year starts June, July 1st of 2000.

215
01:42:34,259 --> 01:43:00,280
18 so anytime between that we're looking to have this council vote on a bond for an architectural services. That's what we're looking for with assurances from this administration that once we're done, do this and we're moving forward with the new fire headquarters. That's, I can't predict month to month, you know, week to week or what goes on. And I, and I agree with you and maybe make sure you guys know what's happening. I agree with your counselor and,

216
01:43:00,567 --> 01:43:28,478
And from what, you know, we're going to, you sat down and we talked to the administration and we're hoping that, you know, going forward, they're going to hold up their rent because we're going to make sure they hold up their rent. Thank you. Thank you. Councilor Lugo-Kern. I'll yield. Name and address of the record, please. Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street in Medford. So I've heard a lot of people talking about the combined facility would be $38 million.

217
01:43:29,204 --> 01:43:49,471
We heard at the debates that they got $10 million in Malden for their police station, and that this administration didn't apply for any because of time restrictions. But if they had gotten $10 million for the facility, that would have brought our costs down to $28 million, which would be only $6 million more than they were talking about for just building a police station.

218
01:43:49,859 --> 01:44:10,666
when we still have a fire station that will be looming over our heads waiting. Do we have any assurances that there'll be time to file for grants for the fire station, or are we just going to pay full price for that one too? Because I heard that they're very concerned about us as taxpayers having to shoulder these bills, but I haven't heard of any grant applications going out to help us.

219
01:44:10,666 --> 01:44:25,972
to offset these bills. I've seen grants for libraries. I've seen grants for renovating sidewalks. Yes, we're renovating sidewalks at a cost to the taxpayer of a quarter of a million dollars. So I would encourage, strongly encourage, and I hope that other people do encourage

220
01:44:26,005 --> 01:44:45,327
The administration to go after these grants because we just left $10 million on the table for the police station at a minimum. Perhaps there were more grants if we combined a police and fire station and we could be having a ribbon cutting or a shoveling for a combined police and fire station. Can I ask you where this $10 million grant was?

221
01:44:46,238 --> 01:45:01,865
When we had the debates, there was a Malden City Councilor who was overseeing it at the high school. That was in Malden. And he said that in Malden, they got $9.8 million for their police station. So we know that the mayor is aware of these grants because she was present at the stage

222
01:45:02,202 --> 01:45:21,727
and clapped vigorously at the grants that he received. And I would have assumed that a phone call to the mayor would have yielded details. I'm not the mayor. Had I made the phone call, it wouldn't have had any effect on this process. I'm more than happy to make the phone call and call the mayor's office and let her know what the grants are.

223
01:45:22,672 --> 01:45:45,520
What we need to do now is since we're clearly going to go forward on just a police station, before the fire tower is knocked down, a new location should be picked for that fire tower. Money should be allocated for that fire tower. The firefighters should be confident that in conjunction with their tower being torn down, a new one will be placed. They shouldn't wait until 2023 or 2024.

224
01:45:45,757 --> 01:46:10,040
or 2022 or whenever to get their tower. They should get their tower immediately because as we're told our insurance rates will go up if they don't have a tower because they'll not be able to do training here. And we also need to figure out where they're going to store their equipment because the very idea of the police, the fire chief thinking that he has to auction off equipment because he has nowhere to store it is chilling and upsetting to me as a taxpayer.

225
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:30,610
I saw the reaction on some of the Councillors' faces and it was upsetting to them as well. And that's something that would have been addressed had these meetings not taken place behind closed doors with a handful of people who all nodded in unison because they agreed with what was happening. We need diverse voices at the table so that multiple layered conversations can take place

226
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:59,973
And these things don't come upon us at the last minute. So I encourage the administration to invite people to the table who will give her different ideas, and not just ideas that agree with hers. That's very important to any administration. And I encourage a future administration in Medford to do the same. Thank you. Thank you. And I know the administration did state that they are looking for grants, both the federal and state level. Counselor Longo-Chagran. Thank you, President Carviello.

227
01:47:00,209 --> 01:47:26,315
I think I stated two weeks ago, this is probably the worst way anything's ever been proposed with regards to a bond in 16 years I've been on the Council. I think the right way to do it is exactly what's written in the memo today, dated February 28th, where a working group will be set up and it will take 18 months to assess and figure out the best location and

228
01:47:27,378 --> 01:47:57,280
figure out everything that's going to be needed for a new fire station. That's the proper way to do business. And that's what should have been done nine months ago. It should have been open and transparent. I'm having a tough time knowing really the position we were put in. It's extremely tough to make a decision. The lack of transparency, lack of communication, closed-door discussions, I feel like this is being shoved down our throat.

229
01:47:58,462 --> 01:48:26,305
I truly feel that a dual facility is going to be the most fiscally responsible way to go. And I think that has to take place after a few months of multiple, multiple working groups to figure out, number one, a working group to research grants. The mayor stated yesterday that she's been in discussions with, I believe, Representative Donato, Catherine Clark.

230
01:48:26,558 --> 01:48:54,250
What time has been put into finding a grant and are there grants out there for dual facility? That needs to come first. I would, for the taxpayers, we're under a lot of pressure tonight, one way or another. Um, we're the, we're the ones that are trying to figure out the best way to go here. And it is very upsetting how much we need a new police station. And obviously now know the concerns of the fire station.

231
01:48:54,554 --> 01:49:23,393
and this is still being pushed down our throat. I don't know how I will vote if the questions move forward, but I think three months of multiple working groups, that be it the fire department, the police department, the administration, with the city council, with the people, with the taxpayers and the citizens of this community, I believe if everybody puts their heads together, we can figure out a way to rule out or continue on with a dual facility.

232
01:49:24,052 --> 01:49:41,956
In a few months after cost analysis is done, Mr. McKillop is exactly right. What are the cost analysis? We don't have any. We were given five days before we could even ask any questions, and we were asked to vote on it. Now, thankfully, we've got two weeks. We've got some breakdowns.

233
01:49:42,125 --> 01:50:08,517
We've got some questions answered. We still don't know. I think it was Councilor Scarpelli last night that asked, what other locations were looked at? We can't be told until those property owners are discussed. That's something we should know before we take this vote. And I know it's not what the police department wants to hear, nor should they have to hear it, because it has been too long. But that's the truth. That's the way this council should be moving forward.

234
01:50:09,665 --> 01:50:38,251
for the benefit of the whole community and what is right, and for us to be completely 100% educated on a financial decision that is going to impact us for 30 to 39 years that our children will be paying for. So I'm going to move that we take three months to create multiple working groups, and we get started tomorrow to figure out the right way to do this.

235
01:50:49,388 --> 01:51:17,738
Chief. Mr. President, Leo Sacco, chief, chief of police. Uh, I just want to make a couple of comments. So basically one major comment with regard to the grants, everyone's talking about all the grants that are out there. I can tell you that been chief now a little over 26 years. And a couple of weeks ago, I told you for the past 20 years, we needed a police station. I can tell you at least once a week, I've been scouring,

236
01:51:18,363 --> 01:51:43,760
different areas looking for grants. No money was left on the table. There has been no money, whether at the federal level or the state level, for brick and mortar construction. Absolutely nothing, because they believe that's a local issue that should be dealt with locally. Malden, to the best of my understanding, received money because they relocated their police station to Eastern Avenue, the further end of the city.

237
01:51:44,722 --> 01:52:12,515
And it's, I guess it's labeled as a redevelopment zone. So they receive redevelopment money for that. We don't have such an area, or at least I don't think we have such an area in our city, but I don't want anyone, people have come up to the podium and talked about grants and money left on the table. I don't want the public to think that the city of Medford was negligent and not looking for funding sources because if it was out there, we would have nailed it. Ladies in the back, please have respect for the chief on the podium. Thank you.

238
01:52:13,342 --> 01:52:42,653
That's all I wanted to say. I just want to make sure the record is straight. We have looked for grants for the, at least the past 20 years for a police station, either through block grants or through federal government, through the state and to private entities for grants. There has been nothing out there. So no money was left behind. If there was, if it was out there, we would have been looking for it. Thank you, chief. On the motion by councilor DelaRusso is seconded by councilor Knight. Mr. Clerk.

239
01:52:48,070 --> 01:53:10,632
The motion was made the first motion. It's a financial paper. If you could, Mr. Clerk, if you could make that as a beat paper.

240
01:53:11,527 --> 01:53:33,076
We already have one B paper you gave already about the mold. Make this a C paper. You take a three month study group, is that correct? Multiple working groups.

241
01:53:45,850 --> 01:54:15,027
On the, on the C paper, all those in favor. All those opposed. Roll call vote has been requested. C paper is for the, uh, three for the three month work study group. Counselor Knight. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. It would be a, uh,

242
01:54:15,719 --> 01:54:45,419
a work study group of police and fire officials and residents to determine location, finances of all the police and fire stations. Is that correct, Councilor Lohengrin? And all the options available. Thank you. Thank you.

243
01:54:45,841 --> 01:55:14,157
Mr. Clay, please call the roll. Councilor DelaRusso. Yes. Councilor Fevella. Yes. Councilor Mayne. No. Councilor McCurdy. Yes. Vice President Montz. Yes. Councilor Scott Kelly. Yes. President Caviello. Yes. Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes. On the B paper, that the city do a mold study in the fire station? Mold and air quality in the fire station.

244
01:55:15,389 --> 01:55:42,068
All those in favor? All in favor and done. Motion passes. Councilor Marks. I'm of emotion, but I did ask several times that we have a project timeline for both the police and the fire station. Yes. If we could take a vote on that too, Mr. We'll have, we'll do it. That'll be a separate paper. That's fine. That's fine. On the motion by council marks that we have a timeline,

245
01:55:42,440 --> 01:56:11,667
Project timeline. For both fire and police. For both fire and police. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. On Councilor DelaRosso's motion that is take the first reading as seconded by Councilor Knight. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor Langlois-Kern. I have these interruptions, Mr. President. Oh, you interrupt all the time. Councilor Langlois-Kern. The C paper, I believe they kind of

246
01:56:12,292 --> 01:56:40,844
The C paper and the main motion. They are kind of contradictory. Contradictory. So maybe we can have a little discussion table. I would move to table. Uh, no discussion. If I table what the bond motion. Yes. I'm table. I don't, I think we've already tabled it once. I don't think it is, uh, you can table at any time. You can't section 22 it. I don't, I don't know if we can table that. Mr. Sure. You can table for a second time. Third, fourth, fifth time.

247
01:56:41,941 --> 01:57:11,000
It's the vote of the floor, Madam Presidents. I moved to table. Mr. President, if you will, uh, section 22 can only be invoked once. That's under the, uh, mass general laws, section 22 of chapter 43. The motion to table is separate from a request for it to invoke section 22 and emotion for table would require the acquiescence of the council. Although the ruling is the chairs, but that is the back on council. Council logo occurrence motion to table.

248
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:40,362
Seconded by... What's the reasoning for the table? Just so I can agree. I think it contradicts to paper C. If we're going to explore, create working groups to explore dual facility and different locations and get cost analysis, wouldn't it be contradictory to approving the bond? One is a resolution and one is a bond order.

249
01:57:40,649 --> 01:58:09,860
The resolution would go to the mayor. Right, so why can't we do both together? Why can't we do both together? Because they're contradictory. It's not contradictory. They're creating a working group while the process is going on. I don't see that as contradictory. On Councilor Longo-Kern's motion to table. Do I have a second? Second. Seconded by Councilor Martz. All those in favor?

250
01:58:10,923 --> 01:58:36,758
The chair seems to be in doubt. Mr. Clerk, if you could please call the roll. Yes. Yes. No.

251
01:58:38,581 --> 01:58:59,000
2 in the affirmative, 5 in the negative. Motion fails. On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso and seconded by an item for the main motion. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll for the law and order. Mr. President, please. You do not get into the roll call vote.

252
01:59:00,265 --> 01:59:27,653
He can speak as many times as he wants. Mr. President, you just don't like me, so that's your problem, Councilor De La Russo. The people out there have elected you people. We're voting on the motion. On your motion, Mr. President. We are voting on the motion. On the motion. But apparently, as Councilor Longo-Kearns alluded to, it is contradictory to the point number C. Councilor Longo-Kearns, there's a resolution that will go to the mayor's office. That will go to the mayor's office, which the mayor can decide to accept or decline.

253
01:59:28,548 --> 01:59:52,662
It's not the mayor's privilege. It's the council's privilege. It's your prerogative, not the mayor's. We are voting on the loan order right at the moment. On the loan order in and of itself. It's your prerogative, not the mayor's prerogative. And you've already voted on point number C, which is contradictory to the main motion. We are voting on the loan order, Councilor Penta. I think you better go. Thank you.

254
01:59:53,641 --> 02:00:21,232
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso and seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. To take its first reading. Councilor DelaRusso? Yes. Councilor Falcone? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Lockhart? Yes. Vice President Marks? Yes. Councilor Scott-Bell? Yes. President Caviello? Yes. The paper will take its first reading. Thank you.

255
02:00:21,788 --> 02:00:44,030
Suspension by Councilor Knight. This paper is eligible for its third reading this evening, which is the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Education, Chapter 26. Mr. Clerk, do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion?

256
02:00:45,346 --> 02:01:08,296
Mr. President, I just wanted to say thank you to all the council members for your support. I know that you've been, it's been a long grind, but you've always been supportive of what we needed in the police station. I want to say thank you for that. I want to thank the mayor for her efforts and

257
02:01:08,515 --> 02:01:32,596
her staff, all the work that they've done in making this possible. But one group I have to note is the police officers, the patrol officers and the superiors. They made this a front burner item and they kept it there. And they deserve a lot of credit for it. That's like we heard the other night about a home. That's their home. So again, thank you. And I want to thank all of them as well. Thanks.

258
02:01:40,004 --> 02:02:09,063
Yeah. One more question, Mr. President. Walter Buckley, Vice President, Local 1032, 340 Salem Street. I just want to thank the councilors that were in favor of at least taking the two weeks to consider and answer some questions that we had. Unfortunately, it didn't come out in our favor tonight, but we want to thank you who put the time and effort into answering our questions. And that's all I got. Thank you.

259
02:02:10,598 --> 02:02:37,160
15, 16, 5, 7, 4, as offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, that it take its third reading this evening. Roll call. Roll call, Mr. Clerk. Sorry? Move approval. Move approval. Roll call vote. Mr. President. Councilor Marks. Maybe for the edification of the audience, they don't really know what this paper is about. You want to give a brief synopsis? Yes.

260
02:02:37,582 --> 02:03:04,092
This paper is in regards to Tufts University notifying the city of Medford of all their students that are living in the city. And the address is and how many people are living in each apartment. So if there are any code violations that our code enforcement officer will be able to rectify them so we don't have any further tragedies going forward like we had seven years ago.

261
02:03:06,050 --> 02:03:33,640
Well said, Mr. President. If I could, I want to thank the Ad Hoc Education Committee. I think it was chaired by Councilor Falco, Councilor Cohen, and Councilor Scarpelli. They did yeoman's work in an issue that's been lingering in this community for a number of years, and one that has an impact on neighborhoods that abut, in particular, Tufts University.

262
02:03:33,843 --> 02:04:01,737
The issues that are involved, Mr. President, this is not gonna solve all the issues, but as was mentioned in the subcommittee meeting, it's gonna be another tool in the toolbox to allow our code enforcement officers to be proactive in some cases and reactive in other cases. So I see this as a good step forward. As I stated at the meeting, Mr. President, I think we need something citywide.

263
02:04:02,058 --> 02:04:24,130
And this is an issue that impacts every segment of this community. We have illegal basement apartments, illegal attic apartments, and at some point it's a quality of life issue in all our neighborhoods. So I'm thankful of the subcommittee's work on this. I'm thankful for the neighbors that showed up at each of the meetings.

264
02:04:24,248 --> 02:04:53,020
to express their opinions on this very issue, Mr. President. And I'm thankful that we now have a tool like Somerville in Boston that will allow us to not only safeguard neighborhoods and the quality of life in a neighborhood, but also, Mr. President, safeguard the students that are living within these apartments, Mr. President, that landlords don't have any care regarding the number of people they're trying to

265
02:04:53,020 --> 02:05:21,522
cram into an apartment. Uh, so I look forward to the implementation of this and eventual use as a, an effective tool for, uh, the neighbors of salt method in the hillside area. Thank you. Mr. Clark, please call the roll. I'll be very brief. I just want to thank my subcommittee members as well. And, uh, the committee as a whole, because at some point this did go to committee as a whole as well. And there were a lot of great questions that were asked.

266
02:05:21,860 --> 02:05:46,345
and just thank the City Solicitor Rumley and John Babuso, our Code Enforcement Officer as well, but also to thank the neighbors that showed up to the meetings, that attended the meetings, and that there are some neighbors that are here tonight that just want to assure that this gets through, and I'm confident that it will, and I think that, like Councilor Mark said, this is another tool that the,

267
02:05:46,548 --> 02:06:14,442
that the code enforcement officer has to keep our neighborhoods safe. Thank you, Councilor Falco. Thank you. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out the work of Barbara Rubel and Rocco DiRico and their work with the council in ensuring that this is an ordinance that is going to be operational. So I'd like to thank the work of the Tufts University Community Affairs Office, especially Mr. DiRico, who's here in the audience this evening. A lot of work was done by a lot of people on this very good mission. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

268
02:06:15,742 --> 02:06:37,308
Councilor DelaRusso? Yes. Councilor Falco? Yes. Councilor Nye? Yes. Councilor Kern? Yes. Vice President Mox? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. President Caviello? Yes. Seven in the affirmative. Motion passes. Motion by Councilor Nye to revert back to regular business. 17085 offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

269
02:06:37,898 --> 02:07:07,632
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be updated with regards to how the plans for the potential new police station were presented to the public last week and how they were paid for. Councilor Lungo-Kern. Thank you, President Carviello. Some of these questions were answered last night during our Committee of the Whole meeting. It looks like Donovan Sweeney was paid $150 an hour. They estimated less than $10,000 has been spent

270
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:36,657
for their services thus far. So if we could just get the only question now that needs to be answered is where did that $10,000, what account or which line item did that $10,000 come from? Okay, on the motion by Councilor Lockern, that we find out where the $10,000, what account the $10,000 came from. Although, do we have a second? Seconded by Councilor Marks. All those in favor? Aye. Aye. All those opposed? Aye. Motion passes.

271
02:07:38,108 --> 02:08:08,011
17088, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request MassDOT take the appropriate steps to have the graffiti at Roosevelt Circle removed. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much. Apparently this quarter it's my turn to bring this resolution forward. I think one of us at one time or another have taken the opportunity to bring this resolution forward and request that the Massachusetts Highway Department, MassDOT, come down and beautify the retaining wall

272
02:08:08,298 --> 02:08:37,778
along Roosevelt Circle, which is right now plagued with very pretty pink graffiti. So, Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues support me in sending a correspondence to MassDOT requesting that that issue be resolved. And if we could maybe send it to Councilor, Representative Donato, that is his district, for his help. Seconded. Seconded by Councilor Alango-Kern. Name and address for the record. Castanetti, Cushing Street. Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing up graffiti. Sometimes it is a problem, visually to the eyes.

273
02:08:38,318 --> 02:09:03,530
On the other hand, it's more important that the state, whoever's in charge, around that circle, the N93, getting on and off, going up towards Wright's Pond. That area, a lot of times, is overgrown with kind of like trees that are wild. And it's a visual obstruction to the drivers.

274
02:09:03,952 --> 02:09:22,126
And that's not an easy place to negotiate vehicles back and forth. Thank you, Councilor Knight. That's correct. Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request that the Massachusetts Highway Department submit to the Memphis City Council a maintenance schedule for the area. Thank you. Do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion? Seconded by Councilor De La Russa. All those in favor?

275
02:09:22,598 --> 02:09:44,452
Motion passes. 17-089, offered by Councilor Knight. Be it resolved that the City Solicitor provide an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a through way. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much. As the Council and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinances begins its discussion on zoning, one of the concerns that's been raised is the

276
02:09:44,941 --> 02:10:13,443
number of commercial and industrial parcels that are coming off the rolls with residential development and the city's future ability to provide an equitable tax shift from the residential tax burden to the commercial and industrial properties, Mr. President. So with that being said, there are certain streets in the vicinity of large commercial developments, such as the Meadowglen Mall, Linden Street being one, that is a dead-end street that abuts the private property of the Meadowglen Mall site. And I'm asking the city solicitor, with the support of this council hopefully,

277
02:10:13,713 --> 02:10:36,477
To provide us with an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a thruway for the purpose of future examination of developing a strong commercial or industrial based district down there for tax revenue purposes, Mr. President. We've talked with some of the neighbors in the area, some of the residents and property owners on the street, and it's something that they've expressed concern about for a number of years in terms of making Linden Street a thruway.

278
02:10:36,764 --> 02:11:04,675
Also, currently, at the present time, there is a construction fence that is up at the end of the dead-end roadway, Mr. President. And in previous years past, due to the involvement and efforts of Fire Chief McCabe at the time, there was a breakaway fence that was put there for public safety purposes so that if there was ever a situation where fire trucks could not enter Linden Street from the Riverside Ave side of the property, they would be able to do so through the abutting property of Meadowland Mall, Mr. President.

279
02:11:04,996 --> 02:11:31,220
So I'd ask that this paper be approved. I'd ask my council colleagues to support it. And as we move forward, I look forward to updating you with any information that we receive. Thank you. Council Member Kern. Thank you. President Carviello, I don't mind getting an opinion on this. I just do want to point out there are neighbors that have reached out to me within the last week, curious why this was on. And they're, you know, I don't know if they're necessarily opposed to it, but they had very grave concerns of opening up Linden Street.

280
02:11:31,726 --> 02:12:01,004
I just wanted to point that out, and an opinion is fine, but whether or not we do it, I definitely think it's something that we need to get that whole neighborhood involved with before we move forward on anything. Councilor Nice. I'd certainly make myself readily available to any constituent that has a question about a piece of paper or legislation that I've put forward, so they're always more than welcome to contact me directly as well, Mr. President. Thank you. On the motion by Councilor Nice, as seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor. The motion is.

281
02:12:02,337 --> 02:12:31,835
Be it resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a through way. There's currently a gate at the end because it will go on to private property. There's a fire gate which the fire department has the keys to. Whether that gate can come down and that public street can go on to private property.

282
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:56,000
No, we're just asking for an opinion. An opinion. Yes. On the motion by Councilor Knight is seconded by Councilor Falco. All those in favor? All those opposed? Motion passes. 17-090 offered by Councilor Knight. Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request

283
02:12:56,287 --> 02:13:23,540
a cost estimate for the repointing of the wall and replacement of the wrought iron gates at Royal Park. Councillor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much. It's been brought to my attention that the gates down at Royal Park were removed. And the reason that they were removed was because for a number of years they were not being utilized as open and closed as often as they have been in recent past. The infrastructure wasn't able to sustain the ongoing use. I believe the,

284
02:13:24,181 --> 02:13:52,042
gates were put up sometime in the 20s according to some of the research that Mr. Lincoln and the friends of the Royal House and the slave quarters have done. So with that being said, Mr. President, there were innate gates that did serve a purpose. I feel as though it's something that should go back up. I feel as though the rotating wall surrounding Royal Park is in disrepair at this point in time and a cost estimate as to what it would take to repoint the brick wall and put up the wrought iron gates is the subject matter of this resolution. Thank you. Counselor Falco.

285
02:13:53,375 --> 02:14:22,467
I'll yield to that. Councilor Feckel, we yield to the gentleman at the podium. Thank you, Tom Lincoln. I'm the executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street. We've been a neighbor of the park for well over 100 years. It wasn't there then, but sometimes it feels like it. In fact, I believe the park was actually either given or sold to the city of Medford in the 1920s as part of the royal estate. We get a lot of visitors from out of town that come to Medford to visit the Royal House and Slave Quarters.

286
02:14:22,906 --> 02:14:51,644
I had a few comments about the state of the gates in the park, and we'd certainly like to see this done, and we greatly appreciate Councillor Knight's resolution along these lines. You may recall, just as a piece of this, that there was an auto accident on the main street side of the park sometime in the last 10 years, I would guess, which caused a lot of damage, and that was repaired. But the masonry, including the low base of some of the wall,

287
02:14:52,235 --> 02:15:20,483
on the George Street side is not in good shape. In addition, we share a common border, a common boundary with the park, a mixed masonry and historic wooden fence. And we've actually had some discussion previously with the DPW and the city about working on that, which we intend to revisit. We'd be delighted, as neighbours,

288
02:15:21,327 --> 02:15:49,677
sort of historic co-owners, shall we say, to see some progress on this. I'm sure the gates, I assume the gates have been stored someplace and could be put up, but I had not realized that the state of the masonry was the main reason that they were removed. So thank you. Councilor Felco. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Lincoln, if I can ask you a quick question, just because while we're on the topic of the royal house, um, you know, it's, it's a historic,

289
02:15:50,082 --> 02:16:09,961
It's something that people drive by, and it's part of Medford. And it's been here for hundreds of years. But if you drive by at night, you never know it was there. So my question is, has there ever been lighting in the front? Because I don't know if there has.

290
02:16:10,147 --> 02:16:36,488
Is there any thought of actually reinstalling lighting or putting lighting in so people can see it at night? Yeah. I know this question was raised earlier, and I think I sent a letter to the council about it. I think Jay Griffin actually was here about it a few weeks ago. Is that possible? At one time, we had what's called architectural lighting on our property to light up the facade of the main building. There was also a light on the slave quarters.

291
02:16:36,978 --> 02:17:06,003
On the slave quarters, we provided other lighting, more like security lighting. In fact, we have another problem with the lantern actually on George Street. Some of this conduit, et cetera, was installed many, many years ago. Since that time, the lighting failed on the facade, but in this period, the whole practice for historic monuments, like National Historic Landmarks, which this is, which is the highest category of historic

292
02:17:06,610 --> 02:17:36,445
protection in the United States have changed, the technology has changed. At this point, we don't feel we can, two things, we're struggling with, struggling is too strong a word, we're debating about what to do, if anything, on that. Of course, the building is set way back from the Main Street side, and so that you need a lot of lighting. And, you know, the cost of that, the aesthetics,

293
02:17:36,867 --> 02:18:03,378
There's some debate. One of the co-presidents, Peter Gittleman of the Royal House Board, actually manages 36 buildings for historic New England. They have the Otis House downtown, and they've had a lot of issues involving architectural lighting. And I think that's become, it's an issue in the rather rarefied world of historic

294
02:18:03,901 --> 02:18:31,255
properties. We've made other improvements on the ground. If you haven't been there for a while, the front entrance has been, we've added an accessible pathway, repaved a long section from the sidewalk up to the slave quarters entrance, and we've done other work on the grounds. It's often said in the historic preservation business, at least

295
02:18:31,441 --> 02:18:58,103
with 18th century buildings, these buildings are almost 300 years old at this point, that you might be better off digging a hole in the ground and shoveling $100 bills in terms of the costs of maintenance. But rest assured, it's something that we're thinking about. It's not my decision. I'm merely the administrator in terms of further lighting there. Do you know if, has anybody taken a look at what that would cost?

296
02:18:58,897 --> 02:19:27,989
We don't have a cost estimate. We've been playing catch-up ball. We redid the decorative fence last year. We need to work on the fence between the royal house and the park, as I mentioned. We've replaced two restrooms. We've done a lot of plumbing, a lot of electrical upgrade. Construction in old buildings with these very high standards is very expensive. So I don't have an estimate. It would involve a new conduit.

297
02:19:28,242 --> 02:19:56,356
And then the tricky part, as I understand it, and I'm no expert on the technology, is what kind of lights, how far away they are, what they get you in efficiency. The lights we had there were the low sodium, which are incredibly inefficient. And in fact, the bulbs are like $75 now, and they don't last long. But the problem is that the conduit is shot, so there's not even any power.

298
02:19:56,660 --> 02:20:24,908
So it's, it's on the list. We have, we have a fairly long list of, of interior and exterior, uh, maintenance and, and restoration, uh, items. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for your hard work. Appreciate it. Thank you. On the motion by council at night is seconded by council. All those in favor. I motion passes motion by the take hands and the clerk.

299
02:20:30,781 --> 02:20:57,342
17 0 9 4. Be it resolved offered by council by president Caravello. Be it resolved that the code enforcement officer contact the representative of planet aid donation boxes. Many of the sites where the boxes are located are overflowing with bags and falling onto the ground. Uh, I have, I have gone by the box on mystic Avenue, uh, up in the heights at, at, uh, on Fulton street and the one at the,

300
02:20:57,646 --> 02:21:22,435
book school and there's bags all over the place. So they haven't been emptied for some time. If the code enforcement officer could, uh, contact them to get them emptied because they are quite unsightly. All those in favor. Councilor Marks. Thank you, Mr. President. And maybe at some point we could send this issue to one of our subcommittees.

301
02:21:22,807 --> 02:21:41,403
because it's a real large issue in this community regarding these metal boxes. I've had the circumstance to go down to Fells Plaza on a number of occasions, and I've talked to the management company, and I've asked them about particular boxes because it may be a clothing box, but there's 22 TVs that are broken.

302
02:21:41,572 --> 02:21:59,527
outside the clothing box, or it's a box just for books, and there's all old clothes out in front of the box. And the management company said, we don't even know why the box is here. So these companies are going around, and I'm not going to pinpoint any company, and they're throwing them on private lots.

303
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:29,750
that's just leaving them there. So I think we need an ordinance, Mr. President, that addresses these boxes. They should have a contact number on the side of the box, a person's name, a phone number, and there should be some type of permitting process if you want to put one of these large metal boxes on your property. So I think we need to send that to a subcommittee, Mr. President. You are correct. I'm not sure which one, but. I think that would go to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances. So if you would like to refer that there. I'd like to refer that there, Mr. President. Thank you.

304
02:22:30,070 --> 02:22:54,455
On the motion by, uh, counseling by President Caravello, all those in favor. Motion passes. Offered by President Caravello and Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its consolances and have a moment of silence to the family of Anna Consolino on her recent passing after a long illness. Uh, if you're from West Medford, anyone, anyone who knows Anna Consolino,

305
02:22:54,758 --> 02:23:07,212
She was a fixture in that square for many, many years, and she passed away last week after a lengthy illness. Counselor Marks. Mr. President, just if I could, I grew up with the family.

306
02:23:07,448 --> 02:23:33,773
in West Meffitt, and the Consolino's name is synonymous with West Meffitt Square. The ARCO service station was in business under Dick Consolino for 61 years. And that service station was a landmark. And every time I drive by and see a bank there, I just, I don't even recognize the area anymore, Mr. President. But Anna Consolino will solely be missed.

307
02:23:34,111 --> 02:23:58,647
And she was a terrific mother and grandmother and a loving wife and a tremendous business person for a lot of people in West Medford. When you brought your car down there and you didn't have the funds to pay, Mr. President, the Consolinos would say, don't worry about it. When you have the money, give it to us. And that just doesn't happen in this day and age anymore. I, being a longtime customer, my dad was a customer of the Consolinos and good people, good family.

308
02:24:10,223 --> 02:24:38,877
Motion to revert back to regular business. 1-7-0-9-2. Communications to the Memphis City Council from the Registrar of Voters and the Chief Election Office. Be it ordered that the Memphis City Council hereby fix following dates and hours for the 2017 city preliminary and election

314
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:35,272
Monday, January 22 final campaign finances do. Thank you. Motion by council for approval. Mr. President, if we could, I believe last year this council made a recommendation that the poll workers that are so diligent and do a great job in the city elections be fed because they're spending 13 hours

315
02:27:35,558 --> 02:28:03,115
In some locations, because of the lack of personnel, it's tough for people to get out. And I would ask, once again, if the city clerk would be so kind to make sure the poll workers get some type of bagged lunch or pizza or something, Mr. President, to show our appreciation for the effort that they put in. Second. Second by Councilor Dela Rosa. Thank you, Councilor Marks. On the motion. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes.

316
02:28:03,352 --> 02:28:33,001
Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scott Pelley. 17-0-9-3 offered by President Caraviello. It resolved that the Memphis City Council announced that the mayor will be commemorating the plaques at War Memorial Park and the city will be looking for any additional names to be added to the list there. I'm glad that the mayor took this up pretty quickly. It's something we asked her for a couple of weeks ago.

317
02:28:33,389 --> 02:29:00,322
And if anyone knows of any names, uh, that need to be added, please inform the veteran services of the mayor's office as soon as possible. So we can get these, uh, get the names on the plaque on the motion by, by, by councilor Del Rosso, all the councilor, councilor Scott Pelley, but I can't real quick. Is there a timeline when we'd like to have that on? I know that's been, um, I think, uh, our original paper said we were, we,

318
02:29:00,608 --> 02:29:25,651
like to maybe get them done by maybe Memorial Day or at the least by Veterans Day. So if we can get the name, I think there's about 10 ish names there at the moment. So if anybody else knows of any names, please get them in. All those in favor. Council Marks. Thank you, Mr. President. You called on me and then you went to Scott Pelley, but that's all right.

319
02:29:27,355 --> 02:29:56,009
He shines a little bit. Mr. President, I think I'm not sure if it was you or one of the other councils offered a resolution to have many of the plaques on our veteran memorials to be refurbished. Yes. Have we got any response regarding the plaques? We have not. I've spoken to the Veterans Service Office, and I think that's a funding issue. Some of the plaques are old and they're tin.

320
02:29:56,633 --> 02:30:25,287
And I have talked to some people who do it. They're unsure if they can even be redone again because of the age and the wear of them. Right. So if we can't refurbish them, we have to replace them. I would hope that the mayor would appropriate some funds to get that done. Well, I would ask that that be part of your paper also, Mr. President, that we get an update on the refurbishment of the plaques. Mr. Clerk, if we could add that onto the paper. If we could look at adding some additional funds to get some of the older plaques.

321
02:30:25,591 --> 02:30:54,650
while the city cleaned and replaced. All those in favor. 17 0 9 1 petition by Jean Martin, 10 coming street, Medford mess to address the council on not erasing Medford's history. Name and address for the record, please. Gene Martin, 10 coming street.

322
02:30:55,088 --> 02:31:18,781
and I'm in a great mood tonight because I played pickleball, and I never played pickleball before, and it was a lot of fun. All right, thank you. I'm not trying to be adversarial, but educational. After attending the mayor's State of the City address, I'm once again compelled by conscience to challenge Mayor Burke's political view, which this council signed off on, as it is

323
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:48,076
inaccurate and harmful as it denies our legacy in reality. Medford was discovered as a, discovered in quotes, as a result of the Sprague brothers finding the existing footpaths of the Indian inhabitants from Salem to Charlestown in 1629. They crossed the Saugus Plains into Malden and then to the edge of the Middlesex Fells all the way to what would become Medford Square. The square is a result of the continued use of this area

324
02:31:48,565 --> 02:32:18,502
as it was the narrowest point in the river at low tide for crossing over, as originally used by the Indian population. Just on the other side was another Indian footpath up to present day Winter Hill. And from there, the Sprague brothers continued down to Charlestown. In 1630, the governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, Matthew Craddock, London merchant and dedicated Puritan, formed his own peculiar plantation

325
02:32:19,852 --> 02:32:46,109
which became our city today. It was seen as peculiar because unlike Cambridge, it was not set up as a town but a private plantation. The original people whose land started to be taken away from them by these English intruders were known as the Pawtuckets. That was the name of the native tribe, the Pawtuckets. A man named Sagamore John was chief of the Pawtuckets.

326
02:32:46,548 --> 02:33:14,577
Sagamore John and his people died of smallpox in 1633. In 1644, the Indians remaining in Massachusetts put themselves under the English government. Once there had been about 20,000 Indians within 50 miles of Plymouth alone. By the close of the century, there were only about 4,000. We know that by the 18th century, not all residents were free. And that's in Medford.

327
02:33:15,421 --> 02:33:43,535
Blacks, Indians, and forgive me for using the term mulattos, that is what is written in the history book that I got this from. It's called Medford on the Mystic, and it was by Carl Seberg, who lived in West Medford on Madison Street. I knew him because I took care of his aunt. Amazing man. Okay. What was I? Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Servants. So these servants were held in slavery. In a census of Negro slaves in

328
02:33:43,906 --> 02:34:10,805
Massachusetts in 1755, there were 34 slaves over the age of 16 living in Medford. 27 were men and seven were women. By 1764, the slave population in Medford had increased to 49. And in case you were wondering if Northern slavery was any better than Southern slavery, think again. Medford selectmen, Medford selectmen,

329
02:34:11,210 --> 02:34:39,779
In 1734, voted, quote, all Negro, Indian, and mulatto servants that are found abroad without leave and not on their master's business shall be taken up and whipped 10 stripes on their naked body by any freeholder of the town and be carried to that respective master's. And said master's shall be obligated to pay the sum of 2S6D in money to said person that shall do so.

330
02:34:40,184 --> 02:35:06,340
Slavery existed in Medford until 1787, when in the case of the Commonwealth versus Jennison, this institution was finally outlawed. Our nation was not founded on the, quote, fundamental principle that all persons are entitled to equal protection under law, unquote. The Declaration of Independence, paragraph two, when Thomas Jefferson wrote, quote, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.

331
02:35:07,252 --> 02:35:36,715
He currently owned 175 black slaves, including five of his own children, by Sally Hemings, who was herself his property. Even at the time of his death, he only freed the slaves of his bloodline, and Hemings herself still remained in bondage to another relative. The document's prime author, Jefferson, was clearly speaking only on behalf of a white class. In one of the complaints Jefferson charged the King of England in the Declaration of Independence, paragraph 29, quote,

332
02:35:36,968 --> 02:36:06,517
meaning the king, has excited insurrection amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguishable destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions. Clearly, Jefferson was not including quote, Indian diversity, as a result of himself, as equal as to himself. And furthermore, it could actually be argued that women as sexes,

333
02:36:06,854 --> 02:36:35,677
were to be protected by the white man from the Indian, which, again, involves non-equality with the Native American. The Constitution of the United States, Article I, Section 2, Paragraph 3 states, representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included within the union according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number

334
02:36:35,980 --> 02:37:02,626
of free persons, this is in the Constitution of the United States and this is in the Declaration of Independence, our founding documents. Just wanted to let you know that. The number of free persons included those bound to service for a term of years and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all persons. In the Federalist Papers, Madison expressed the Southerner's own conflict between his self-interest

335
02:37:03,048 --> 02:37:24,428
and having his slaves counted as persons for the purpose of the numbers of representatives in Congress, quote, one representative for every 30,000, unquote, due to the South's low rural white population comparative to the northern states and the incongruent concept that slaves were solely property. The two concepts required mental gymnastics.

336
02:37:24,783 --> 02:37:53,909
as they also used northern and southern women to argue in favor of using slaves in their census by suggesting that states already counted women who are also without suffrage in their census for the purpose of representation. Northerners are just as guilty, for they had just as much self-interest in denying slaves as persons for the same reason, congressional representation. Northerners, through Madison, stated, all this is admitted

337
02:37:54,247 --> 02:38:22,732
It will perhaps be said, but does it follow from an admission of the numbers for the measure of representation or of slaves combined with free citizens as a ratio of taxation? That slaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of representation. Slaves are considered as property, not as persons. This was the Northern argument. They ought, therefore, to be comprehended in estimates of taxation, which are founded on property.

338
02:38:23,086 --> 02:38:50,069
and to be excluded from the representation which is regulated by a census of persons. Indians not taxed means that some Indians were taxed, which I infer to indicate that some Indians were still enslaved peoples at the time of this writing of the US Constitution. In either case of our founding, does the white man view either the African slave or the Indian as persons entitled to the equal protection under law?

339
02:38:52,415 --> 02:39:22,064
Article 1, Section 8, Paragraph 3. To regulate commerce in foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes. Explanation, Madison states that, quote, the regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations of the Articles of Confederation, which render the provision obscure and contradictory. The power is their restraint to Indians, again,

340
02:39:22,435 --> 02:39:50,363
The power is there restrained to Indians, not members of any of the states, and not to violate or infringe the legislative right, meaning US legislative right, not the Indians' rights, of any state within its own limits. What description of Indians are to be deemed members of a state is not yet settled and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils and how the trade with Indians

341
02:39:51,578 --> 02:40:18,072
Though not members of a state, so the Indians were not considered members of the state, yet resided within its legislative jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external authority. Without so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation is absolutely incomprehensible. Article 1, section 9, paragraph 1, quote, the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit

342
02:40:18,460 --> 02:40:46,608
shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808. But a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding $10 for each person. Madison's papers, in short, compromised with southern state leaders in order to grandfather out slavery by stopping its international trade starting in 1808, 20 years after the signing of the Constitution.

343
02:40:47,620 --> 02:41:17,506
Article 4, Section 2, Paragraph 2 and 3. Councillor Knight. Well, I do find this history lesson very entertaining. I'm having trouble connecting its pertinence to the deliberations of the Memphis City Council at the current time. I will get that. Thank you. This is evidence that the mayor's statement that you guys signed off on is inaccurate in its statement. When you say that this country was founded on

344
02:41:18,181 --> 02:41:43,865
equal protection under law. It's absolutely not right, and it's inaccurate, and it's harmful, and I'm gonna argue that point in a minute too. Okay, and entertaining, no, but it should be educational. A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime who shall flee from justice and be found in another state shall, on demand of the executioner,

345
02:41:44,810 --> 02:42:14,138
executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up to be removed to the state having jurisdiction over the crime. I'm almost done. You're coming up on your 10 minutes. Yep. Thank you. No person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered upon

346
02:42:14,965 --> 02:42:42,387
claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due, which is used to justify the fugitive slave law. Here I come into my argument. Thank you very much. In conclusion, your political worldview, and that includes you guys because you signed off on it, does a disservice to the city by erasing its history. It ignores the brutal historic context that both Native Americans and African Americans have had to live under in our economic and political system throughout our history.

347
02:42:42,843 --> 02:43:11,058
which denied their basic humanity and collective legitimate grievances. This country still lives with the legacy of the racially motivated slaughter of Native Americans and human bondage of African Americans. Again, respect for diversity is not an original concept of the founders. It is my belief that you have adopted this concept of diversity because it is politically advantageous to all the new groups coming in.

348
02:43:11,648 --> 02:43:41,146
to the city, including women, gays, people of color, races. While I applaud your intent to include diversity, I cannot allow you to exclude the hard, cruel facts of our founding. And I do recognize that some of other racial groups and religious groups have faced discrimination. Nothing comes close to these two collective experiences. Erasing history as it actually happened contributes to not only the pain and suffering of the two primary racial groups here described, but denies them reasonable mitigation

349
02:43:41,568 --> 02:44:04,383
for the institutional legacy we are required by conscience to assist in resolving. Therefore, the city needs to retract that diversity statement and rewrite it in a way that reflects their reality, not comforts yours. And I would say in all, one more thing. When you point a finger at somebody, you're pointing three back at yourself. But somebody else told me, a wise woman told me,

350
02:44:04,703 --> 02:44:33,712
If you have a criticism, you should have three responses. So I, I will help rewrite this. That's what I'm saying. Thank you very much. Thank you. Name and address for the record, please. Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass. I want to thank Jean Martin because she helps us not be doomed to repeat it. Erasing Medford history is key and I thank her.

351
02:44:34,268 --> 02:45:03,192
for bringing that information to the public here at the People's Forum. The etch-a-sketch history of a city not documenting room 207 meetings is exactly bringing that point into the future. This city council works very hard in those room 207 meetings. Now, I took a video with my camera to preserve Medford history because this is history tonight, the last day of February.

352
02:45:03,952 --> 02:45:32,487
2017, this is history. We're doomed to repeat it if we don't document and study and analyze what goes on in room 2207, if we don't tape our athletic events, our cooking shows, Wright's Pond, fiction and nonfiction in Medford. We don't have that. And Gene's absolutely right. When there's a state of the city address and the people here

353
02:45:33,567 --> 02:46:00,753
didn't seem diverse, it seems like a polarized city, that should be documented. It should be on public access TV. And I appreciate the counselors that are respectful and listen to Ms. Martin, because she worked hard on that paper, and I appreciate it, and I think she did a great job tonight. But Room 207 is sometimes like an executive session at a board meeting, where people are excluded. An open meeting law should include documenting important history.

354
02:46:01,343 --> 02:46:28,715
And the citizens of Medford want to know what's going on with our fire department, with our police station. As we found out tonight, this room was packed very good. How do we preserve Medford history? Those being paid $30,000 a year need to sit in their seats and listen to people. One counselor was rustling papers, cleaning up a desk while Jean was talking. That was very disrespectful because she pays his salary.

355
02:46:29,002 --> 02:46:56,980
Clank clangs the doors. Counselor Penta speaking. One counselor shutting doors and getting water. Very disrespectful. We do not preserve our history by futzing around and being disrespectful and then demanding respect, demanding respect when you don't earn it, but you take out $30,000. So Jean, it would be great when we get a TV station, let's take your essay. Let's get the kids of the school. Let's get the seniors.

356
02:46:57,352 --> 02:47:21,922
to speak into the camera and preserve our history. Those who don't preserve it are doomed to repeat if they don't know. Thank you, City Council of Medford. Have a good end of February. Thank you. Records of February 14th were passed to Councilor Dela Russo, who is not feeling well. Councilor Dela Russo, are you feeling better this evening, and have you reviewed the records?

357
02:47:27,305 --> 02:47:56,532
Mr. President, though my health has recovered, a discrepancy in the records has been pointed out to me. Until a thorough investigation can be conducted into the whereabouts of a counselor on the evening in question, I shall not take these records off the table. Thank you very much, and if you could bring that matter to the clerk for his attention, we would appreciate it. The records of the meeting of February 21st, 2017 were passed to Counselor Falco

358
02:47:56,718 --> 02:48:23,262
Councilor Falco, how did you find them? Thank you, Mr. President. I reviewed the records and found them to be in order and I move approval. Motion for approval by Councilor Falco. Second by Councilor Mox. Mr. President. All those in favor? Aye. Aye. Motion to adjourn by Councilor- Happy Fat Tuesday. Motion to adjourn by Vice President Mox. Larry.
