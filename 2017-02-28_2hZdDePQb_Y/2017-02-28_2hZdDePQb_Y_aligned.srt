I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:06:53,458 --> 00:07:00,803
On the motion by Councilor Marks for suspension of the rules so that we can present a citation to Reverend Noah Evans.

21
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:07,548
Welcome to City Council.

22
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:08,528
You've been here many times.

23
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:18,070
For those of you who don't know, for the last nine years, Reverend Noah Evans has been the pastor of the Grace Episcopal Church.

24
00:07:19,991 --> 00:07:24,392
On March 5th will be the last Sunday Mass for Noah Evans at the church.

25
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:29,354
Reverend Noah will be moving to Mount Lebanon Episcopal Church.

26
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:34,535
The Reverend has been an integral part of our community and has helped build relationships

27
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:37,736
of support to many in our community.

28
00:07:38,657 --> 00:07:45,580
Reverend, you have been a positive spiritual presence for everyone in the city of Medford and have been an inspiration to all who have known you.

29
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:57,705
Today, we want to say thank you for how you walked in truth, for how you shared God's word, salvation, life, and for each soul you renewed.

30
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:03,188
Thank you for the time you have spent and the hours you have gladly gave to our community in unfolding

31
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:05,634
of God's perfect way at Medford.

32
00:08:06,254 --> 00:08:13,657
The residents of Medford wish you and your family the best and hope you have more wonderful opportunities on the road ahead.

33
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:21,680
We will miss you, but in more ways than you'll know.

34
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,341
We thank you and we owe you a great debt of gratitude.

35
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:29,723
Your presence in our community is going to be missed more than you know.

36
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,743
Reverend.

37
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:48,760
I think before we give you a citation, I think maybe some of our counselors may want to give you a couple of words.

38
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,262
Counselor Marks, would you like to start out with something for the Reverend?

39
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:56,904
Thank you, Mr. President.

40
00:08:57,224 --> 00:09:04,948
As you mentioned so eloquently, Reverend Noah has been an integral part of this community and has been a voice of reason.

41
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:11,211
He was at the council meeting, I don't know, maybe a month ago or so in representing

42
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,528
issues of concern in this community.

43
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:18,329
And I know his shoes are going to be sorely missed in our community.

44
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,650
And I wish you well in your new endeavor.

45
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,752
And if you ever need anything, give us a call.

46
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:25,772
Thank you.

47
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:27,012
Councilor DelaRusso.

48
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:29,353
Mr. President, thank you.

49
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:39,997
Reverend Noah, it's been a pleasure working with you over these years and an honor to work with you in your parish and to minister alongside of you.

50
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:43,592
as we both walk people through the darkest moments of their life.

51
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:46,637
I know the skill set that you have.

52
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:55,109
I know the concern that you have, not only for the people of the parish, but also in the greater community in the outreach you've done.

53
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,121
in the urban centers of this area for the poor.

54
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:01,222
So I wish you well.

55
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:11,406
I know you have a great task before you to minister to the people of Pittsburgh, and I wish you, your wife, and your children well.

56
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:12,187
Thank you.

57
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:13,067
Thank you, Councilor Duda.

58
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:14,127
Councilor Falco.

59
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:19,249
Reverend Owens, thank you for all that you've done for our community throughout the years.

60
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,310
You have

61
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:31,451
been a big part of just leading the interfaith group within our community, all churches, Catholic, Protestant, Episcopalian.

62
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:36,734
And I know you brought that group together like it's never been before in our community.

63
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:37,474
And that's meant a lot.

64
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,816
And I wish you well in your future endeavors.

65
00:10:40,976 --> 00:10:47,520
And on a personal note, I know my in-laws belong to the Episcopal church.

66
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,782
And when my father-in-law passed away,

67
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:53,700
with him to the end, and that meant a lot to our family.

68
00:10:54,401 --> 00:10:57,703
And I thank you for everything that you've done on a personal note and for our community.

69
00:10:58,004 --> 00:10:58,264
Thank you.

70
00:10:59,225 --> 00:10:59,765
Councilor Knight.

71
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:04,069
Mr. President, thank you very much, and Father Noah, thank you very much as well.

72
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:05,810
You've been a great next-door neighbor.

73
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:14,677
I've lived next door to the Grace Church now for a number of years, and I've certainly seen the parish grow under Father Evans' leadership.

74
00:11:15,198 --> 00:11:20,262
You've done a great job here in the community, and we really can't thank you enough for the efforts that you put forward in building social capital

75
00:11:20,741 --> 00:11:23,123
creating an engaged citizenry with the parishioners.

76
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:24,504
So thank you very much, Father Evans.

77
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:25,605
You're going to be sadly missed.

78
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:29,889
But I'd ask that even though you're down there in Pittsburgh, you still pray for us up here in Medford.

79
00:11:30,109 --> 00:11:30,610
Thank you very much.

80
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,890
Thank you.

81
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,171
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

82
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:35,394
Thank you, President Caravaglio.

83
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,716
I just want to echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

84
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:41,119
You've done great work in Medford, and we're going to sorely miss you.

85
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,761
Best of luck in your future.

86
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:43,802
Thank you.

87
00:11:43,842 --> 00:11:44,762
Councilor Scarpelli.

88
00:11:45,263 --> 00:11:45,563
Again.

89
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:50,339
I echo what my colleagues have said, Reverend Noah.

90
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:54,861
Your vision and your leadership within our community is going to be sorely missed.

91
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:56,983
I just, something they all missed.

92
00:11:57,043 --> 00:12:02,406
I just hope that you remember that you left a Patriots fan and hopefully you don't become a Stalers fan.

93
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:04,887
So, thank you very much and God bless.

94
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:05,687
Thank you.

95
00:12:07,508 --> 00:12:08,269
Solicitor Rumley.

96
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,050
Thank you.

97
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,393
Reverend Noah, I speak to you tonight just briefly and as a friend.

98
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:23,765
And I only want to say one particular thing, that there's a quality of Christianity that you exhibit so well.

99
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:29,590
And it's one that I've observed over all the times that we've been together in the past years.

100
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:35,696
And that is, you are genuine and authentic, and I've been blessed to know you.

101
00:12:36,197 --> 00:12:36,557
Thank you.

102
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:37,618
Thank you.

103
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:39,800
At this point, it gives me great pleasure

104
00:12:40,523 --> 00:12:43,805
to present this citation to Reverend Noah Evans.

105
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:57,711
The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council commendation to Noah Evans, Rector, Grace Episcopal Church, in recognition of your leadership to the members of the Grace Episcopal Church and to the community of the city of Medford.

106
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:09,397
Since your arrival in 2008, the Grace Episcopal Church has seen 50% growth in attendance, significant growth in stewardship, growth in the Children's Center,

107
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:14,540
in the completion of a major capital campaign in the building project at the parish.

108
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:25,003
You've restarted the Protestant chaplaincy at Tufts University and have been a leader in the Medford Conversation project, as well as spearheaded green improvements throughout the parish.

109
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:33,186
It is with great pleasure that the Medford City Council rises up to join you and your family and friends on this remarkable milestone.

110
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:38,928
On the behalf of the citizens of the city of Medford, we wish you good fortune on your new home as rector

111
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:39,735
at St.

112
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:46,257
Paul's Episcopal Church in Mount Lebanon, the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

113
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:47,738
Thank you very much.

114
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:57,541
Thank you.

115
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:00,241
Thank you.

116
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:00,682
Thank you.

117
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:08,524
It has been such a blessing to be able to serve both at Grace Church and be able to serve with you all in the city of Medford.

118
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:22,627
I've learned so much from this city and the way that you're committed to your life together and working things out and living in the diversity of this community and moving this changing community forward.

119
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:33,430
I really truly believe that Medford is a beacon to the world of a way for people to live together, especially a diverse people to live together.

120
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,291
And thank you for all of your leadership.

121
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,916
all of your leadership in that.

122
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,019
It's been an honor.

123
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,621
Thank you.

124
00:15:17,388 --> 00:15:17,548
Oops.

125
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:47,613
Sorry, Rick.

126
00:15:48,373 --> 00:15:51,076
Here we are.

127
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,700
Oh, that's a good shot.

128
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,662
This is going to cost you $5, Cop Yellow.

129
00:15:57,822 --> 00:15:57,942
OK.

130
00:15:57,982 --> 00:16:01,525
Take it off my salary.

131
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:03,547
Thank you very much.

132
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:04,108
Good luck.

133
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:04,768
Thank you.

134
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:05,409
Have a good day.

135
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:09,372
I hope that the parish can find someone that's as equal to you.

136
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:40,886
Motion by Councilor DelaRusso to return to regular order of business.

137
00:16:40,906 --> 00:16:43,687
17-084 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern.

138
00:16:44,427 --> 00:16:50,449
Be it resolved that the administration hire a full-time qualified grant writer.

139
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,330
Councilor Langel-Kern.

140
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,371
Thank you, President Carviello.

141
00:16:54,771 --> 00:17:01,193
This is something that I've put on the council agenda before, probably three, four years ago.

142
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:08,139
And it's something we discuss and bring up usually every budget season, if not more.

143
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:23,670
And in light of what's gone on in the last several weeks especially, I believe that we truly need somebody qualified to help us write grants, to help our department heads write grants, to be able to tap into the funding that is out there.

144
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:29,795
We saw and we've been discussing grants for police stations and other facilities.

145
00:17:30,385 --> 00:17:42,988
We just saw our neighbor Malden get $9.8 million in a grant, which is approximately half of the new build for their police station that just was opened in the last couple months.

146
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:46,149
There's also other possibilities.

147
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:54,491
I know that we could start off by getting a mentor, somebody to help the people here at City Hall that do write an occasional grant.

148
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:58,932
We are lucky and have good department heads that will write a grant here and there.

149
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:09,971
But they're not dedicated full-time grant writers, and I think we're missing out on something that can be so beneficial and pay for itself tenfold, if not more.

150
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:12,933
It's just something that I think the city needs.

151
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:22,720
Also, grant mentor, I was given some information today from a resident who said that the service co-ops of retired executives make mentors available.

152
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,902
So in the meantime, while we're exploring the possibility of

153
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:30,633
hiring, whether it be a part-time or full-time grant writer, there are mentors out there.

154
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:38,735
And these are the things that the city needs to tap into so that we could do more projects and more projects that are needed.

155
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:47,397
We could be able to spend more of our general fund on maintenance and things that obviously we sometimes fall short on.

156
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,958
So I would ask for a roll call vote on this.

157
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:54,859
And we really look into this to get a grant writer and put it in the next budget, if not sooner.

158
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:55,459
Thank you.

159
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,983
Councilor Knight.

160
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:59,685
Mr. President, I feel as though this is a great resolution.

161
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:02,606
I second Councilor Lungo's motion for approval.

162
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:11,191
On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kern, seconded by Councilor Knight, a roll call vote has been requested.

163
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:14,953
Councilor DelaRusso.

164
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:15,713
Yes.

165
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:17,274
Councilor Falcone.

166
00:19:17,374 --> 00:19:17,534
Yes.

167
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:18,775
Councilor Knight.

168
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:19,135
Yes.

169
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:20,836
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

170
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:20,956
Yes.

171
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:22,277
Vice President Marks.

172
00:19:22,377 --> 00:19:22,637
Yes.

173
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:23,918
Councilor Scott Kelly.

174
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:24,258
Yes.

175
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,512
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

176
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:31,274
Motion passes.

177
00:19:31,294 --> 00:19:31,274
17.

178
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:34,116
Yes, Mr. Councilor Del Rosso.

179
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:35,697
Second by Councilor Knight.

180
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:35,737
17-075.

181
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:55,838
Loan order.

182
00:19:55,858 --> 00:20:03,945
Oh, okay, I'm sorry, wrong one.

183
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:04,425
17-018.

184
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:05,866
Thank you.

185
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:14,073
Committee of the whole meeting report from February 22nd, 2017 regarding the bond order for the police station.

186
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,018
Councilor De La Rosa.

187
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:29,372
We have met in great detail, not only last Wednesday, but last night.

188
00:20:29,872 --> 00:20:38,438
We received over the weekend of a number of responses as to questions that were sent to the administration.

189
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:39,239
They've been answered.

190
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:49,006
We had multiple opportunities for discussion, remonstration, and sharing of diverse opinions.

191
00:20:49,762 --> 00:21:01,197
Uh, Mr. President, uh, we've gotten our answers and a motion to, uh, as it was re uh, reported out of committee motion to adopt the committee report.

192
00:21:01,538 --> 00:21:05,583
I think a solicitor Romney Romley as a wants to make a statement.

193
00:21:07,286 --> 00:21:07,366
No.

194
00:21:10,174 --> 00:21:14,796
I do have the mayor's communication that she had submitted to the council.

195
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:14,996
Yes.

196
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:22,960
I don't know if this would be the appropriate time with the reporting out of committee, but I think it would be assuming that other procedural things fall into place.

197
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,920
Okay.

198
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,221
Motion by Councilor DelaRusso that the committee report be adopted.

199
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:29,622
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

200
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:30,403
All those in favor?

201
00:21:30,903 --> 00:21:31,023
Aye.

202
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:32,084
Motion.

203
00:21:32,644 --> 00:21:33,624
While we're under suspension.

204
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:33,664
17-086.

205
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:33,704
17-086.

206
00:21:41,143 --> 00:22:00,008
Offered by Councilor Lungo, Kern, and Mox, be it resolved that the Energy and Environmental Office update the Memphis City Council with regards to concerns they may have about 92 Main Street being on a flood plain.

207
00:22:00,468 --> 00:22:01,348
Councilor Lungo, Kern.

208
00:22:02,008 --> 00:22:03,548
Thank you, President Carvio.

209
00:22:03,668 --> 00:22:06,269
I just feel a couple of these resolutions.

210
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:07,749
90 Main Street.

211
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,030
92 Main.

212
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,490
90 Main Street.

213
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:09,670
90 Main.

214
00:22:10,324 --> 00:22:12,926
I feel a couple of these resolutions probably come first.

215
00:22:12,966 --> 00:22:17,551
They're pertinent to I think something that will come in a little bit.

216
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:25,778
It was brought to my attention that 90 Main Street is on a flood plain.

217
00:22:25,838 --> 00:22:31,423
I believe climate change in Medford, it's a group that's working on mapping out the city.

218
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:35,888
finding future floodplain issues.

219
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:42,632
They did detailed mapping, including air quality, heat gain, sea level rise, and the potential flooding of lots.

220
00:22:43,313 --> 00:22:46,555
And 90 Main Street is on that list of a potential floodplain.

221
00:22:47,055 --> 00:22:52,478
So I think it's just extremely important to get an update from our Energy and Environment Office.

222
00:22:52,578 --> 00:22:56,601
I'm not sure if our consultant can discuss whether or not that's on a floodplain.

223
00:22:59,182 --> 00:23:03,145
And I'm not sure if anybody's here to answer any questions, because I know that's pertinent

224
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,033
potential vote that may take place in a little bit.

225
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:06,593
Thank you.

226
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:11,356
Councilor Knight motion to refer to the subcommittee on environmental affairs.

227
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:11,836
Mr. President.

228
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:12,396
Second.

229
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:14,218
Seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

230
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,320
All those, uh, all those in favor.

231
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:18,800
Aye.

232
00:23:19,101 --> 00:23:23,443
Aye.

233
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:24,624
You didn't push a button.

234
00:23:26,265 --> 00:23:27,706
Oh, I'm sorry.

235
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:28,746
I'm sorry.

236
00:23:29,047 --> 00:23:29,627
Hey, that's all right.

237
00:23:30,548 --> 00:23:45,337
Mr. President, I concur with the sentiment of my colleague, Counsel Lungo Kern, and where we have the gentleman from Dunneman Sweeney, is it possible maybe if you can get up and explain if this would have an impact on the cost of the project itself?

238
00:23:46,578 --> 00:23:56,944
If he's not able to answer that, Mr. President, that's fine, but I'm just concerned that if this wasn't taken into consideration and if it needs to be taken into consideration.

239
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:58,485
Mr. President?

240
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:00,653
Councilor Don Rosso.

241
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:09,837
Also, do we need to be concerned that where it's on a floodplain, do we have to be concerned whether Route 16 and half of Medford Square will be swept away?

242
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,438
I would hope that the gentleman maybe will have an answer for us.

243
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:14,419
Thank you.

244
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,860
Name and address of the record, please.

245
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,161
Jeff Shaw, Donovan Sweeney, Architects on 16 J Street in Somerville.

246
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:26,224
I can say that it's always going to be a consideration for any project going into construction.

247
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:32,920
to take into consideration all of the environmental characteristics of the site.

248
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:43,162
So Mr. President, if we could just ask, typically, in your opinion, what does this add to the overall cost of a project?

249
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:46,063
Are we looking at, is there an industry standard?

250
00:24:46,663 --> 00:24:50,704
Is there an additional 10%, 20% that you add on to a cost?

251
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:52,785
Or has that already been considered?

252
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,411
The project as was conceived already has a budget.

253
00:24:57,852 --> 00:25:00,773
It considers the site costs at this point in time.

254
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:09,856
The actual configuration and how the site is dealt with during construction would be done at that later date when the design is completed.

255
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:15,459
So potentially there could be a request for additional funding if need be?

256
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,640
I don't think I can answer that question.

257
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,401
I think it takes into consideration a hypothetical.

258
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:24,723
information about.

259
00:25:25,303 --> 00:25:27,504
Well, the fact that it's on a floodplain is not hypothetical.

260
00:25:28,385 --> 00:25:32,568
The fact that it's located in a sign haven't been determined yet.

261
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:35,050
I don't understand.

262
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:42,075
I don't know exactly if there would be any consideration of additional costs because we haven't done the actual design.

263
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:43,336
So there may be none.

264
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:43,956
Right.

265
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:49,660
We, we, we heard just the president last night that, uh, you know, money's tight in this community.

266
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:55,296
And the only reason why we bring this up is that if there is an additional cost, I think we should know it ahead of time.

267
00:25:56,016 --> 00:25:57,978
Uh, so that, that's the only reason why I ask.

268
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:14,307
And I don't know if council along with current already made a recommendation, but I think we need to know, and maybe they have to do some more homework on it, but if there is additional cost because of the property being located in a floodplain, uh, according to, uh, our own energy and environment office.

269
00:26:15,228 --> 00:26:16,689
So I'd make that part of the report.

270
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:18,630
If council, I don't think for the city engineer, the,

271
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:20,529
Well, the environmental office.

272
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:20,749
Okay.

273
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,230
Ed, do you have that?

274
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,473
Refer to the environmental office?

275
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:30,133
Councilor Lococo.

276
00:26:30,694 --> 00:26:31,034
Thank you.

277
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:41,159
It may be pertinent to send into more to have more discussion in committee, but I think we need an update from our environment and energy environment office first.

278
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:42,880
So if we could get,

279
00:26:44,170 --> 00:27:08,208
have the administration look into a cost, if it is on a floodplain, how much, obviously, Council Member Mox's amendment, but we need an update with regards to this before we meet in committee, so if we could maybe change that around, get an update, get cost estimates, figure out how much additional cost it's going to be, and get an update, and then we can put it into committee.

280
00:27:08,468 --> 00:27:12,771
I would ask my colleagues to get an update first.

281
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,941
Do you want to withdraw the motion?

282
00:27:19,401 --> 00:27:20,701
The motion is to send it to committee.

283
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:23,882
I would like that withdrawn so we can get an update first.

284
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:28,203
This isn't something that can linger in committee for months and months.

285
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:29,063
I mean, we have eight months.

286
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:38,004
Then it would be incumbent upon the committee to meet and to request the pertinent information that's necessary to make an informed, you know, to get the questions answered as soon as possible and request any information that they like.

287
00:27:38,044 --> 00:27:39,044
To get the pertinent information?

288
00:27:39,064 --> 00:27:41,545
I would like to get this information, meet,

289
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:45,920
with the information and then ask additional questions.

290
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,062
There's no reason why we have to delay it two, three, four weeks to even refer the questions out.

291
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,183
We're being rushed.

292
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:55,264
This is being shoved down our throat.

293
00:27:55,544 --> 00:28:02,367
We have questions that need to be answered, and this should be answered first before we send it to committee in a month or two, whenever we decide to meet.

294
00:28:04,848 --> 00:28:08,590
So I'd ask for a roll call vote on my resolution to get an update.

295
00:28:10,733 --> 00:28:16,754
On the motion by Councillor Wong-Tam to get an update on the flood plain conditions.

296
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:18,235
From Ms.

297
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:19,795
Alicia Hunt.

298
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:23,776
I know there's a committee working on it right now.

299
00:28:24,716 --> 00:28:26,637
I believe there was a committee meeting.

300
00:28:26,697 --> 00:28:33,779
I'm not exactly sure when it was scheduled for but it was pretty recent and this was information that was divulged.

301
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:38,660
We just would like her written opinion on it and to know more information.

302
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,580
I wasn't at that meeting.

303
00:28:40,322 --> 00:28:45,384
I don't exactly know when it was, but it's information that we need as soon as possible, not in a few months.

304
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:47,525
Okay.

305
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:55,948
So your motion is to get an update from, from, from the office of environment and energy regards to the floodplain.

306
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:58,889
And if there will be any additional costs regarding the product.

307
00:28:59,209 --> 00:28:59,629
Yes, please.

308
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:07,492
On the second by council marks second by council marks, all those in favor roll call.

309
00:29:07,532 --> 00:29:07,632
Aye.

310
00:29:09,567 --> 00:29:10,667
Roll call has been requested.

311
00:29:10,847 --> 00:29:11,388
Mr. Clark.

312
00:29:12,848 --> 00:29:15,369
So the motion to refer the committee is withdrawn.

313
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:15,809
Yes.

314
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:16,869
Oh no.

315
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,190
We'll also go to committee also.

316
00:29:22,911 --> 00:29:29,834
We'll get an update from the engine from the city engineer table before the council at this point in time is to request the information and then have a subcommittee schedule so that they can be discussed.

317
00:29:29,874 --> 00:29:30,014
Okay.

318
00:29:33,135 --> 00:29:33,975
Roll call has been requested.

319
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:34,475
Mr. Clark.

320
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:35,136
Yes.

321
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:35,216
Yes.

322
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:40,585
Yes.

323
00:29:42,305 --> 00:29:42,565
Yes.

324
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:43,986
Yes.

325
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:45,406
Yes.

326
00:29:45,866 --> 00:29:46,066
Yes.

327
00:29:46,126 --> 00:29:46,986
Seven in the affirmative.

328
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:50,767
None negative motion passes.

329
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:53,547
17 0 8 7 offered by counselors.

330
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,248
Longo Kern and vice-president of mocks.

331
00:29:56,288 --> 00:29:59,348
We have resolved that the city of Medford update the Memphis city council.

332
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:07,690
We regard to who has been hired to be the OPM on this project manager for the, for the potential new building at 92 main street.

333
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:08,810
Counselor Longo Kern.

334
00:30:10,897 --> 00:30:12,418
Yes, we could just get an update.

335
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:15,519
I'm sure somebody would be able to answer this today.

336
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:19,180
Who's going to be the owner's project manager?

337
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,782
I believe that needs to be decided before we go out for architectural studies.

338
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,344
Councilor Locks.

339
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:30,405
Thank you, Mr. President.

340
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,286
We have the mayor's staff here.

341
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:38,508
Maybe they can enlighten us on who's going to be the OPM for this particular project.

342
00:30:40,383 --> 00:30:41,864
uh, Mark Romley city solicitor.

343
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:47,708
It's not under my jurisdiction at all, but I can tell you this, that no one has been designated at this juncture.

344
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,269
Is there a plan to designate someone?

345
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:50,830
There has to be.

346
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,251
It's required under the law for a project of this size.

347
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,874
So, so it's required prior to any design.

348
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:57,454
Is that correct?

349
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:58,355
No, it is not.

350
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:01,577
It's required during the design phase, which hasn't begun yet.

351
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:09,162
So when is the design phase that well, once we get a loan order to pay for the design services, the architectural services.

352
00:31:09,662 --> 00:31:09,862
Okay.

353
00:31:10,186 --> 00:31:15,129
Because the way I read the law, it says that OPM has to be hired before the project designer.

354
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,691
Okay, so we're on the same page.

355
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,072
I think, yeah, we're pretty much on the same page.

356
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,112
It's also concurrently.

357
00:31:20,593 --> 00:31:20,673
Okay.

358
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:23,275
So if you want to use that synonym, that might work also.

359
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:24,335
That's fine with me.

360
00:31:24,535 --> 00:31:24,836
Thank you.

361
00:31:27,357 --> 00:31:28,518
Name and address of the record, please.

362
00:31:28,918 --> 00:31:31,200
Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street, Medford, Mass.

363
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:48,885
I actually have in front of me from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the Office of Administration and Finance for the Division of Capital Asset Management, the Owner's Project Manager Guidelines for Mass General Law, Chapter 149, Section 44A 1⁄2.

364
00:31:49,786 --> 00:31:51,947
I'd like to read it, just to be clear.

365
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:54,109
Effective on July 19, 2004,

366
00:31:56,278 --> 00:32:07,068
Chapter 193 of the Acts of 2004 inserted a new provision into Mass General Law 14944, which governs public building procurement.

367
00:32:08,239 --> 00:32:21,381
The new provision requires public awarding authorities to engage the services of an owner's project manager on all building projects estimated to cost $1.5 million or more.

368
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:36,924
The law requires that the owner's project manager, also known as the OPM, be hired before the project designer, meet required minimal qualification standards, and be selected through a qualifications-based selection process.

369
00:32:37,964 --> 00:32:55,755
The OPM acts as the awarding authority's agent and consultant throughout the project from the design through completion and must be completely independent from the designer, general contractor, and any subcontractors involved in the projects at all times.

370
00:32:56,755 --> 00:33:01,738
The law provides a listing of the minimally required duties of the OPM as follows.

371
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,020
And I'll just read this and then I'll stop.

372
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:24,994
The duties of the owner's project manager shall include, but need not be limited to, providing advice and consultation with respect to design, value engineering, scope of work, cost estimating, general contractor and subcontractor prequalifications pursuant to 44D.5 or 44D.75 where applicable.

373
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:48,582
scheduling, construction, the selection, negotiation with oversight of a designer, and as a control standards for monitoring performance of the building project and assisting in project evaluation, including but not limited to written evaluation of the performance of the design professional.

374
00:33:49,107 --> 00:33:50,988
contractors and subcontractors.

375
00:33:51,488 --> 00:34:00,233
And attached to this seven-page document, it outlines what the OPM is required to do by law and what you can ask them to do.

376
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:06,076
According to this law, your OPM should have been hired before you even engaged with the architect.

377
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:09,498
And I can give that to you so you guys can see it.

378
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:10,399
Thank you.

379
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:10,959
Thank you.

380
00:34:17,843 --> 00:34:18,263
On the motion.

381
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:22,467
On the motion by Councilor Langley-Curran, seconded by Councilor Martins.

382
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:26,231
So we ask that we be apprised of who the OPM is once the selection is made.

383
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:26,791
That is correct.

384
00:34:26,851 --> 00:34:27,092
Yes.

385
00:34:27,952 --> 00:34:28,693
All those in favor?

386
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:29,053
Aye.

387
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:31,075
Motion passes.

388
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:33,518
Mr. President, while we're on suspension.

389
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:34,539
Yes.

390
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,161
Can we take the paper off the table?

391
00:34:38,202 --> 00:34:39,223
And which one would you like that to be?

392
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,045
I would like that paper to be

393
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,665
On the motion of Councilor Del Rosso to take paper 17075 off the table.

394
00:34:49,745 --> 00:34:51,426
Councilor Del Rosso.

395
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:51,687
Present.

396
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:55,069
Motion to approve.

397
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:58,152
Motion to approve by Councilor Del Rosso.

398
00:35:13,053 --> 00:35:14,674
seconded by Councilor Knight.

399
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:16,936
All those in favor?

400
00:35:18,597 --> 00:35:20,278
Roll call vote is required.

401
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:20,899
Mr. Clark.

402
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:30,346
Mr. We have, uh, the only update I have is whatever you received from the mayor this, this afternoon.

403
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:35,910
Taking out of it.

404
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,072
It's asking to take its first reading.

405
00:35:40,734 --> 00:35:40,874
Yes.

406
00:35:41,643 --> 00:35:45,967
Councilor Lococo.

407
00:35:45,987 --> 00:35:46,127
Okay.

408
00:35:46,147 --> 00:35:47,249
So that's a motion for approval.

409
00:35:47,269 --> 00:35:47,789
Okay.

410
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:48,590
Of the paper.

411
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,676
Um, no, I just didn't know if we had any updates from anybody before we take that vote.

412
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:58,319
The only update you have is whatever the mayor sent you earlier today.

413
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,341
And I think the people should be apprised of it.

414
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:00,882
Thank you.

415
00:36:02,055 --> 00:36:02,895
Name and address of the record.

416
00:36:03,096 --> 00:36:05,937
Hello, Brian, president of local 10 32 officer three 40 Salem street.

417
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,478
Uh, I was just coming up here.

418
00:36:07,518 --> 00:36:11,039
Counselors that, uh, we'd like this, this paper read aloud.

419
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:17,662
Um, that, uh, okay.

420
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:18,503
Thank you.

421
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:20,003
Thank you very much.

422
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:20,484
Thank you.

423
00:36:21,784 --> 00:36:25,146
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council, Mark Rumley city solicitor.

424
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:27,447
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

425
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:36,658
The communication that the council received late this afternoon or early this evening, I have with me tonight.

426
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:44,122
The mayor has asked that I read it because not everybody has received a copy, and that would give them the information of what's included.

427
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,284
And it is to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council.

428
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:52,406
Dear Mr. President and councilors, this month,

429
00:36:52,994 --> 00:37:02,881
I have put before the city council my request for a loan order to finance the cost of architectural services for a new police station at 90 main street.

430
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:08,445
I consider this long overdue effort to be one of which we can all be proud.

431
00:37:09,826 --> 00:37:18,172
Concurrently, I have heard the concerns of the Medford firefighters about their training facility and fire headquarters on main street.

432
00:37:19,152 --> 00:37:19,993
With this in mind,

433
00:37:20,861 --> 00:37:26,823
I have met with representatives of the fire department and have given them my commitment to address their concerns.

434
00:37:27,843 --> 00:37:33,344
And as I said last night, my commitment will be more than words, it is action.

435
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,945
The action to which I commit is as follows.

436
00:37:38,026 --> 00:37:49,609
One, I will appoint a working group of fire personnel to assess appropriate sites for the construction of a new fire station slash headquarters and fire training tower.

437
00:37:50,872 --> 00:37:57,375
The amount of $500,000 will be appropriated for the construction of a fire training tower.

438
00:37:58,716 --> 00:38:03,759
The sites to be reviewed will include, but not be limited to, the current headquarters.

439
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:14,084
Number two, the working group will submit a written report to the mayor 18 months after it commences its assessment.

440
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:19,467
Its report will primarily include its recommendation as to preferred sites,

441
00:38:19,894 --> 00:38:22,935
for the construction of a new fire station slash headquarters.

442
00:38:23,695 --> 00:38:27,616
It shall also recommend a site for a fire training tower.

443
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:29,317
Number three.

444
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:41,941
After the mayor receives the recommendations of the working group, the mayor will seek cost estimates for the construction of the new fire station slash headquarters and fire training tower.

445
00:38:43,661 --> 00:38:44,222
Number four.

446
00:38:46,482 --> 00:38:48,903
The mayor will submit a loan order to request

447
00:38:49,621 --> 00:39:06,248
of the city council to finance the costs of architectural services for a new fire station slash headquarters no later than the end of fiscal year 2019 provided the working group meets all the above deadlines and requirements.

448
00:39:07,808 --> 00:39:09,429
I am proud to make this commitment.

449
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:17,112
I consider it the best way to serve those who serve us so well, the members of our police and fire departments.

450
00:39:17,748 --> 00:39:21,371
respectfully submitted, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

451
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:22,752
Thank you.

452
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:24,154
Thank you, Solicitor Rumley.

453
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:27,997
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

454
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,219
Thank you, President Carviello.

455
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:35,723
We did meet a couple hours last night with regards to some just some additional questions.

456
00:39:35,763 --> 00:39:36,364
I'm not sure.

457
00:39:36,384 --> 00:39:39,046
I treasure, if you could come up, Ms.

458
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:39,326
Irwin.

459
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:44,551
We had requested just the numbers of that break-even point of where

460
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:48,448
where we would have to possibly do, you know, an override.

461
00:39:48,568 --> 00:39:50,329
And you said you'd provide those to us today.

462
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:50,470
Was it?

463
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,190
I did.

464
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,913
I did get a handout to the clerk's office today.

465
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,355
So hopefully you received that.

466
00:39:56,375 --> 00:40:02,940
I didn't see that.

467
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:12,028
It has a legal sheet on the back.

468
00:40:17,553 --> 00:40:19,435
So if you could maybe just break this down for us.

469
00:40:19,455 --> 00:40:19,715
Sure.

470
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:28,342
I, as I, um, we talked about last night, the, uh, new growth and how we were going to be able to consider that in the future.

471
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:32,625
I think Councillor Kern, you asked us to maybe do a 10 year average.

472
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:38,970
And so what we did was I looked back starting in 2005, uh, through 2017 and the average new growth was about 1.1 million.

473
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,170
Um, but,

474
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,982
That factored in a couple of years that were really meager.

475
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:50,823
2005, I believe.

476
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:55,025
In 2011, we had some really short new growth.

477
00:40:55,605 --> 00:41:03,850
So what we did going forward on the first page, if you look, is that we used 1.75 as a new growth number.

478
00:41:05,551 --> 00:41:08,492
And actually, you can see on page 3,

479
00:41:12,215 --> 00:41:20,441
that our levy of $105 million, just below that you'll see a 2.5 increase and then a new growth number of 1.75.

480
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,542
And so that brings us to $4,378,000.

481
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:26,946
And that continues all the way down through, let's see, FY, looks like FY 31, all the way down.

482
00:41:35,741 --> 00:41:44,287
So that number on the end there, 4378-373, is the amount of revenue that we'll be able to levy going forward.

483
00:41:44,788 --> 00:41:58,638
And so what we did was take that number, and then if you do look on the first sheet, you'll see that it's a little convoluted, but I think if you stay with me, you can follow it.

484
00:41:58,798 --> 00:42:01,000
The first column is personnel.

485
00:42:01,988 --> 00:42:13,015
And that is then followed by ordinary income, which is, I mean, revenue, which is just about everything, and then enterprise and debt.

486
00:42:13,135 --> 00:42:20,400
And so what we did was take personnel, and we increased that by 2% each fiscal year.

487
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:29,125
We took out the insurance costs and multiplied those out at an 8% increase each year going forward.

488
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:39,253
So in the final column, you'll see that we have, in 2017, $3,475,000 worth of debt service.

489
00:42:40,174 --> 00:42:58,064
And going forward, as we get into the years where we'll start to pay back the architect and the police construction fees debt service, you'll see, on the right-hand side, that we will have an increase in our budget in FY

490
00:42:58,678 --> 00:43:01,219
18 of $4,020,000, excuse me, and we'll have a levy of $4,378,000.

491
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:02,639
Are you following me?

492
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:03,279
Am I making sense?

493
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:04,940
And so that gives us $357,000 left.

494
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,521
Now, if you follow that down, you're going to see that in 2020, we will be in a deficit of $998,000, which is going to require

495
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:31,166
free cash to make those debt payments.

496
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:50,794
Going beyond that, we level out for a while, and then when the schools are paid, and then on the final one, or the second to last one, you'll see that that includes a payment for a new fire station with the architect rolled into it.

497
00:43:51,875 --> 00:43:53,836
And so that brings us to a $6,454,000

498
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:06,004
increase in our budget, but we'll get $5,204,000 in our levy, which will then again require an infusion of free cash.

499
00:44:07,325 --> 00:44:07,445
Okay.

500
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:08,985
If I may ask questions of the chair.

501
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:11,726
So this breakdown, I understand the breakdown.

502
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:15,807
Is this just with regards to our police station or this is if we did both?

503
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:19,209
You'll see at the bottom, um, in FY 25,

504
00:44:20,772 --> 00:44:29,178
there's a payment, which would essentially mean that the police would come online first, and then in five years, we would have the fire come online.

505
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,500
A fire bond.

506
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,161
In 2025?

507
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:34,562
Yes.

508
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:36,463
That would be the first debt service payment.

509
00:44:39,785 --> 00:44:40,045
OK.

510
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:48,431
So in 2020, with just doing the police station, we're going to need to borrow from Free Cash to balance the budget.

511
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:49,072
That's correct.

512
00:44:49,909 --> 00:44:58,451
But by you telling us that, that means we will not be able to put another bond on our books unless we were going to take more from free cash until 2021.

513
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,872
Unless we had an infusion of more new growth.

514
00:45:04,193 --> 00:45:06,673
It would have to, you know, that these are just projections.

515
00:45:06,733 --> 00:45:09,114
These aren't, you know, hard and fast numbers, certainly.

516
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:12,935
So we would have to see, you know, what happens in the next fiscal year.

517
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:13,659
Right.

518
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:20,943
There'd never be enough new growth to sustain a library in between the police and the fire.

519
00:45:20,963 --> 00:45:21,003
No.

520
00:45:21,143 --> 00:45:29,967
Okay.

521
00:45:30,107 --> 00:45:31,608
I think I understand the breakdown.

522
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:36,630
Vice president box.

523
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:42,973
If I could, and thank you for providing this in my, my question last night was at what point, because,

524
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:51,320
we were told if we were moving forward with the police headquarters, uh, there was no talk about any proposition two and a half override.

525
00:45:51,781 --> 00:46:00,744
It was only when we mentioned about combining police and fire headquarters, it was mentioned last night, well, we're going to need a proposition of a two and a half override to afford that.

526
00:46:01,185 --> 00:46:06,507
And my question was at what dollar amount triggers the two and a half override?

527
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:08,736
And I thought that's what you were going to provide.

528
00:46:08,796 --> 00:46:11,497
Well, I can't give you the exact dollar amount.

529
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:24,322
I can tell you that we would be, uh, with 1 million with the police station and a dual, uh, facility, we'd be at about two and a half million, uh, in the negative in 2018.

530
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:31,204
And that would require an override because we, I don't know where else we would get it to pay for in the next 30 years, every year.

531
00:46:34,743 --> 00:46:38,326
So you're saying an additional $2 million every year if we were to build?

532
00:46:38,886 --> 00:46:39,727
A dual facility.

533
00:46:39,827 --> 00:46:40,588
A dual facility.

534
00:46:40,808 --> 00:46:41,088
Correct.

535
00:46:41,609 --> 00:46:46,513
And the need, based on the current $38 million you're talking?

536
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:47,834
Yes.

537
00:46:48,134 --> 00:46:59,864
So if we were able to offset some of that with free cash, the $9 million in free cash, or if we were able to offset that with some grant funding, that would no longer be the case, correct?

538
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:07,610
Well, I mean, those are scenarios that I can't give you a definite answer to that it would or would not require an override.

539
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,552
Today, I can't say that.

540
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:24,702
I can say fairly certainly that, you know, a $2.5 million deficit probably would require it because that's an ongoing debt that would be 30 years, it would be continuing, excuse me, for 30 years.

541
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:29,738
It's not a one-year thing where we could borrow free cash.

542
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:35,983
And again, our free cash is our rainy day fund, our stabilization fund.

543
00:47:36,984 --> 00:47:40,127
We can't use it to pay debt service for 30 years.

544
00:47:41,047 --> 00:47:45,171
No, but you can use it in cases of public safety and needs that arise.

545
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:54,378
Yes, and generally in cases where you're using it for a one-time fix or an emergency or something to that effect, but for debt service that's going to be

546
00:47:55,275 --> 00:48:00,536
uh, 30 years, you know, using free cash is, is, is not wise.

547
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:04,357
And it's obviously not, not something we can afford to do.

548
00:48:04,737 --> 00:48:04,917
Right.

549
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:10,298
So, so I guess my question is that, uh, we heard tonight from the mayor and her response.

550
00:48:11,118 --> 00:48:17,579
Um, so just so I understand, it appears that, uh, we're not looking for at least a payment.

551
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:24,140
If we were eventually to go through with a new fire station, the first payment wouldn't come, uh, until,

552
00:48:26,736 --> 00:48:27,336
2025?

553
00:48:27,036 --> 00:48:27,336
Correct.

554
00:48:28,557 --> 00:48:31,759
And typically, how long does it take for us to pay off?

555
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,602
When would the building be built in order for us to have a first payment?

556
00:48:36,382 --> 00:48:40,485
Well, it wouldn't necessarily mean when it's built, but when we go to bond.

557
00:48:41,165 --> 00:48:49,831
So we would get the architect first, then we would wait for the plans, and then we would do some cost estimates.

558
00:48:50,031 --> 00:48:53,133
And then we would go to bond based on your approval.

559
00:48:53,815 --> 00:48:58,858
And we would have a, you know, a payment probably about 18 months after we bond it.

560
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:00,039
Right.

561
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:02,220
So, so I'm just trying to figure out the time.

562
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:08,504
So, so if, uh, we were to move forward with the proposal that was mentioned tonight, correct.

563
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:19,150
And, uh, the firefighters got together with their group and the firefighters, uh, after their due diligence of 18 months, which puts us in what, 2019, um,

564
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:24,514
make their recommendations to the mayor.

565
00:49:24,835 --> 00:49:25,115
Correct.

566
00:49:25,335 --> 00:49:31,840
The mayor then moves forward as she stated within the paper that she will initiate another design.

567
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:37,205
She would anticipate a loan order for another design for architectural fees.

568
00:49:37,245 --> 00:49:37,545
Correct.

569
00:49:38,005 --> 00:49:43,370
And that would take us how long roughly for the plans?

570
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:45,011
I would say probably 10 months.

571
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:45,912
Same as the police station.

572
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:46,692
So close to a year.

573
00:49:46,712 --> 00:49:52,297
So that brings us to 2020 then we get that back and then we go out for an RFP once we get

574
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:56,063
The design, which takes how long, roughly?

575
00:49:58,786 --> 00:50:00,347
I would say probably six months.

576
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,368
Six months, so that's mid of 2020.

577
00:50:02,989 --> 00:50:07,512
And then what happens between the next five years?

578
00:50:08,433 --> 00:50:09,934
Is that when the building's built?

579
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:17,560
Well, we have to prepare for building it, and provided all those things go into sync, yes.

580
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:21,163
And then at some point, we would be here again asking for a bond.

581
00:50:21,957 --> 00:50:24,518
and we would do that borrowing based on the time frame.

582
00:50:25,138 --> 00:50:31,881
Ideally, we want the schools to be paid for before we can go forward on that project.

583
00:50:33,022 --> 00:50:42,365
So what was stated last night more or less is being stated again tonight that we're looking at 2025 before we see anything.

584
00:50:42,725 --> 00:50:42,946
No.

585
00:50:43,946 --> 00:50:48,688
Well, I don't believe so because we also, if we bond an architect,

586
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:57,391
In 2019, excuse me, we have five years to repay that or roll that into a new construction bond.

587
00:50:57,931 --> 00:51:01,992
So we would obviously anticipate rolling that into a construction bond.

588
00:51:02,372 --> 00:51:06,013
So we would have to do that within a five-year period.

589
00:51:06,473 --> 00:51:13,195
And the goal is to get that done sooner rather than later, but not until the schools come offline.

590
00:51:13,936 --> 00:51:14,156
Right.

591
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:16,877
So it seems like we can't afford this until 2025.

592
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:21,233
No, we can start the project.

593
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:22,894
We can't afford the debt service.

594
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:30,196
We could probably even afford it in 2024 based on these numbers.

595
00:51:31,117 --> 00:51:33,618
But it would give us a little breathing room.

596
00:51:35,078 --> 00:51:40,040
If you see right here, we'll have excess of $329,000 in the year before.

597
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,081
So if we take on that debt, it would probably be similar.

598
00:51:43,876 --> 00:51:44,036
Right.

599
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:55,084
But, but it seems like, uh, from what I gathered last night, the city's trying to get away as far down the line as possible from the year 2020 when the police department comes online as a payment.

600
00:51:55,745 --> 00:51:56,685
Is that, is that not correct?

601
00:51:56,705 --> 00:52:04,251
You're trying to get as far away as possible to kind of as far away, but we're trying to absorb the costs of the police department and get back on our feet.

602
00:52:04,411 --> 00:52:05,432
And then the, uh,

603
00:52:06,621 --> 00:52:17,711
I'm just trying to figure out for the firefighters when they could possibly, if everything works out perfect and we know it's not a perfect world, when they could possibly see a new fire station.

604
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:19,372
That's all I'm trying to gather.

605
00:52:20,573 --> 00:52:27,059
And if it's 2025 or 2024, I don't know, but I think some type of timeline.

606
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:30,402
Those are the dates that the debt service would be due.

607
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:32,704
So when we bond,

608
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:37,894
We don't make those debt service payments sometimes for a year or 18 months after.

609
00:52:38,535 --> 00:52:41,657
So it could come online before that.

610
00:52:43,138 --> 00:52:44,840
Is there any way we can get a timeline?

611
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,422
I mean, is there any way we can get some type of time?

612
00:52:48,462 --> 00:52:53,626
Maybe the firefighters have this in their head already, but I'm trying to get my hands around it just to see.

613
00:52:54,107 --> 00:52:55,448
What the timeline is on this?

614
00:52:55,488 --> 00:52:57,869
The timeline shapes up as it goes along.

615
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:08,095
As the mayor indicated in her letter, by FY19, if we bond an architect, we are on our way to building a fire station.

616
00:53:08,635 --> 00:53:12,658
And so once that starts, then there are obviously, you know,

617
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:22,003
I can't tell you what those are, but once we bond it, then our debt service, we can roll it into another bond.

618
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:24,586
There are other ways to look at it.

619
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:26,548
I realize what you're saying.

620
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:29,031
My only concern is that 2019 and 2024 and 2025 is a big difference.

621
00:53:29,051 --> 00:53:29,692
That's a five-year span.

622
00:53:34,866 --> 00:53:38,127
So, and I don't think the process takes that long, to be quite honest.

623
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,367
And it may not.

624
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:40,068
It may not.

625
00:53:40,088 --> 00:53:41,768
I've been here through the building of the new schools.

626
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:43,388
I've been here through the DPW.

627
00:53:43,689 --> 00:53:47,270
I've been here under a lot of projects, and it seems like a long time.

628
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,810
And I just want to fight.

629
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:49,310
And it may not.

630
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,951
We want to avoid escalation costs.

631
00:53:50,991 --> 00:53:57,072
We're not going to start and get architectural services and get cost estimates and then wait three years.

632
00:53:58,453 --> 00:53:59,673
We're just going to lose money on that.

633
00:53:59,713 --> 00:54:02,014
You want to wait so we don't have to go towards Proposition 2.5, correct?

634
00:54:03,395 --> 00:54:05,996
Well, we can't do that in 2017 is what I'm talking about.

635
00:54:06,056 --> 00:54:06,936
No, but I mean even 2020.

636
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:11,158
2020 is going to be a tough year, yes.

637
00:54:11,238 --> 00:54:15,640
If the process was sped up, just say the process weren't perfect.

638
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:21,042
In 2020, would we be able to go out for a bond with a new fire station?

639
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:21,202
No.

640
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:22,063
No, OK.

641
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:23,083
So that's what I'm getting at.

642
00:54:23,523 --> 00:54:26,745
So we're looking down the line for a purpose.

643
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:29,666
We're not looking at 2025.

644
00:54:31,026 --> 00:54:32,267
That's when our debt service

645
00:54:32,758 --> 00:54:33,518
becomes due.

646
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:34,118
Right.

647
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:35,479
So it might be the year before that.

648
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:36,059
I understand.

649
00:54:36,279 --> 00:54:36,459
Right.

650
00:54:36,739 --> 00:54:42,420
So I understand your situation where you're saying there's a big time gap between 2019 and 2024.

651
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,981
There's five years there.

652
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:45,921
Right.

653
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:48,921
That is not necessarily how it's all going to happen.

654
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:54,683
I mean, when you're at the end of fiscal 19, you're going to move right into fiscal 20.

655
00:54:54,743 --> 00:54:56,263
You're already in fiscal 20.

656
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:58,183
That's the year that we have to get through.

657
00:54:58,283 --> 00:55:01,104
And we would still be waiting for architectural services

658
00:55:02,272 --> 00:55:12,079
to do their plans and to come back to us and have cost estimates and do RFPs and then decide how much we're going to spend and how we're going to pay for it.

659
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:14,181
And then we would start the bonding process.

660
00:55:14,241 --> 00:55:15,222
But remember, it's 2017.

661
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:21,606
We already kicked the can to 2019 saying this is when their recommendation is going to come out.

662
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:24,168
So we've already bought ourselves almost two years.

663
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:29,291
So it sounds, it just sounds like a real lengthy process.

664
00:55:29,672 --> 00:55:31,333
I just want the firefighters to know

665
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:39,925
when we could eventually see a building and having a timeline, just a sketch of a draft saying, this is the timeline.

666
00:55:40,165 --> 00:55:47,108
We look to get back the firefighters proposal, this, you know, 2019 and May of 2019.

667
00:55:48,608 --> 00:55:52,870
Shortly after that, the Bay is gonna go out for an architectural design in June of 2019.

668
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:56,111
Then we're gonna get back and review this for six months.

669
00:55:56,411 --> 00:55:58,612
I'm sure you could put that together.

670
00:55:58,652 --> 00:55:59,432
That doesn't seem like,

671
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:00,736
complex.

672
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:14,843
As I said there are a lot of factors that go into that and you know the mayor's had conversations regarding this and she's eager to get this headquarters built or fire station built.

673
00:56:15,223 --> 00:56:19,165
We just have to be patient with regard to our debt and that's all I can tell you.

674
00:56:19,185 --> 00:56:21,005
I know she's eager but we're equally as eager.

675
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:26,568
Everybody is eager and as I said the longer we go the escalation costs are greater

676
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:31,141
And it doesn't behoove us to, would there are other projects that are going to want to come online?

677
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:32,662
We, and I agree with that.

678
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:41,124
I was prepared to vote on a combined center last week, so I don't want to wait another day, but, but needless to say, that doesn't seem to be the druthers of the administration.

679
00:56:41,484 --> 00:56:43,905
So all I want to know is what, what is the timeline?

680
00:56:43,925 --> 00:56:51,367
If you don't have it tonight, I would ask that the administration provide us at least from myself would be very helpful to see a timeline.

681
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,281
on when this is all going to take place.

682
00:56:53,301 --> 00:56:55,923
Well, I just gave you anticipated dates.

683
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:59,565
I mean, you can extrapolate from there.

684
00:56:59,725 --> 00:57:03,907
I cannot guarantee you when we're going to have a ribbon cutting at a fire station.

685
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:09,030
I don't want to guarantee, but I think the firefighters should have an idea if it's 2024 or if it's 2027.

686
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,032
I think they should have an idea.

687
00:57:11,092 --> 00:57:19,317
Well, I mean, clearly, we've factored it in as a debt service payment for 2025, which means that it would be bonded sometime in 2020.

688
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:21,577
21, 22 maybe, maybe 23.

689
00:57:21,678 --> 00:57:22,958
So you're looking at 24, 2024.

690
00:57:23,018 --> 00:57:23,818
For the building to open?

691
00:57:23,978 --> 00:57:24,399
For it to open?

692
00:57:33,196 --> 00:57:40,397
we have some type of, I, I, well, I, I'm not, I'm not the procurement person and I'm not the, um, I'm just trying to get it.

693
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:41,717
I'm just trying to get a handle in.

694
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:42,118
That's all.

695
00:57:42,378 --> 00:57:42,578
Right.

696
00:57:42,698 --> 00:57:51,019
And I, and I think we've, uh, you know, the mayor has worked with the firefighters to, to let them know how eager she is to have this happen as we all are.

697
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:56,340
So, I mean, there's no, no, one's going to be dragging their feet in 2000 and 22.

698
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:02,201
Um, about one of the clarification council among occurring.

699
00:58:02,672 --> 00:58:06,493
Even though nobody's dragging their feet and we're eager, you also just said we can't afford it till 2025.

700
00:58:06,894 --> 00:58:12,556
And when we can, we're still going to have to take $1,000,000.25 from free cash to do it.

701
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:16,477
No, I said we couldn't afford, really, to do a dual facility.

702
00:58:17,378 --> 00:58:25,801
But your breakdown says we're still going to have to take almost $1,000,000.25 from free cash in 2025 when the fire station comes on the books.

703
00:58:26,481 --> 00:58:27,421
Right, and we could do that in 2024.

704
00:58:29,413 --> 00:58:31,774
because the schools will no longer be online.

705
00:58:32,334 --> 00:58:34,315
That goes away, all that debt.

706
00:58:35,056 --> 00:58:38,257
Right, but I thought that was factored in and we still needed to take from free cash.

707
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:41,899
We still will need to take from free cash because we have other borrowings.

708
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,401
That's my, yeah.

709
00:58:45,841 --> 00:58:46,181
Thank you.

710
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:47,642
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

711
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:59,068
This is all assuming that we don't receive any outside funding sources, number one, and number two, that we don't also incur any acquisition, land acquisition costs to find a new facility.

712
00:59:00,696 --> 00:59:01,996
for to locate a new facility.

713
00:59:02,016 --> 00:59:05,837
If it's not in the existing facility, you know, there might be land acquisition costs as well.

714
00:59:06,137 --> 00:59:07,637
So it's going to be a dynamic and moving object.

715
00:59:07,917 --> 00:59:11,238
Yes.

716
00:59:11,898 --> 00:59:14,518
You all set another question.

717
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:19,179
So, and, and, and I, and I appreciate all the information.

718
00:59:19,219 --> 00:59:23,160
If you could put together some type of timeline that that'd be very helpful.

719
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:28,401
I'm sure the firefighters would like to see a timeline and I know it's not exact,

720
00:59:29,042 --> 00:59:30,683
something that at least we can go by.

721
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:35,784
I'd be happy to work with ShopCon, who's our procurement director, and with the mayor's office.

722
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:36,444
That's great.

723
00:59:36,484 --> 00:59:36,805
Thank you.

724
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:45,587
My other question, Mr. President, is regarding the advisory committee that's set up under this particular agreement.

725
00:59:47,628 --> 00:59:50,809
It is just consisting of all firefighter personnel.

726
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:51,729
Is that correct?

727
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:53,890
I don't believe so, no.

728
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,791
I believe it's a working group that will be

729
00:59:57,436 --> 01:00:00,857
have mayoral appointees, and have appointees by the fire chief.

730
01:00:01,657 --> 01:00:04,798
So it says, I will appoint a working group of fire personnel.

731
01:00:06,298 --> 01:00:09,419
I think there will be people besides fire personnel on there.

732
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:14,121
Yes.

733
01:00:17,021 --> 01:00:19,522
So do we know what it's going to consist of?

734
01:00:20,602 --> 01:00:22,923
Excuse me, Madam Treasurer.

735
01:00:23,241 --> 01:00:50,020
I don't no one has been appointed yet but when I was speaking to the mayor today she talked about her conversations with the chief and the chief alluded to that last night that he was going to be providing her with some suggestions also and I know that she had also talked with the president of the union about that but there have been no names designated no I think if your question is if they are going to be exclusively Medford firefighters I think that certainly they're going to be represented to a significant and substantive degree

736
01:00:50,313 --> 01:01:02,337
But there could be other professional people that are engaged in not necessarily like fire departments and buildings and that sort of thing or the proper locations.

737
01:01:02,377 --> 01:01:06,439
There are all kinds of people that could lend relevant information to this.

738
01:01:06,859 --> 01:01:09,180
But the thrust of this and the substance of this

739
01:01:09,529 --> 01:01:11,791
is to have fire personnel on this working group.

740
01:01:12,131 --> 01:01:15,554
Even the numbers, I haven't heard what numbers they're going to be like, how many.

741
01:01:16,735 --> 01:01:27,924
So could we just reword that because when you read it, honestly ‑‑ I understand your sentiments, Councillor, and the reason we can't reword it is this is a statement of commitment by the mayor and I'm not authorized to change that wording.

742
01:01:28,904 --> 01:01:32,107
under this commitment, the mayor is saying it's gonna exist solely of fire personnel.

743
01:01:32,187 --> 01:01:35,349
That's the way, I don't see how else you'd read that.

744
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:47,437
You can define fire personnel as being members of the Medford Fire Department, and that certainly would be true, and you can also define it as fire professionals, perhaps who are retired, who are not on the active force, and those who have, right.

745
01:01:47,777 --> 01:01:55,643
So if we're going to get down to nuance, definitionally, what working group of fire personnel means, we could take some time with that,

746
01:01:55,973 --> 01:02:07,102
But I think that the honest truth is that this commitment indicates that the mayor is working with our immediate fire personnel, being the chief, and has talked to the union leadership about this.

747
01:02:07,162 --> 01:02:18,931
And I don't think anybody feels for one second that Medford fire personnel are not going to be a substantial part of this, but there's always the possibility there could be retirees or others who could lend their experience and talents to this.

748
01:02:19,311 --> 01:02:25,576
The only reason why I want to bring it up is because when the original proposal was made two weeks ago,

749
01:02:26,428 --> 01:02:30,050
there was no input from, uh, the fire rank and fire personnel.

750
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:32,732
There was no input from the rank and file police department.

751
01:02:33,072 --> 01:02:42,477
So I want to make sure now as this process goes along that at least we're, we're talking about a new fire headquarters that the fire department personnel be at the table.

752
01:02:42,857 --> 01:02:43,037
Yes.

753
01:02:43,418 --> 01:02:45,199
And I, and I think that's the only reason why I bring it up.

754
01:02:45,439 --> 01:02:45,639
Right.

755
01:02:45,699 --> 01:02:47,260
And I think those sentiments are prudent.

756
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,762
I understand those, those sentiments and there is the mayoral commitment before the council this evening.

757
01:02:52,763 --> 01:02:53,023
Thank you.

758
01:02:55,403 --> 01:02:58,205
So Mr. President, just one of the, one of the question if I could.

759
01:02:58,225 --> 01:03:22,142
Um, so, uh, onto a council and I mentioned if, uh, this working group were to get together and decide that, uh, uh, they need a new fire station possibly, uh, behind here at city hall and a lot behind city hall and, uh, their training, uh, tower, uh, possibly in another section of the city on a private property that needs to be purchased.

760
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:28,763
These factors will all be taken into consideration regarding the cost, correct?

761
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:29,983
Correct.

762
01:03:30,063 --> 01:03:41,485
But the architect has a $10 million land acquisition line item in the proposal that he has if we were to build a dual facility on a new site.

763
01:03:41,806 --> 01:03:49,827
So obviously the $18 million price tag for the fire station at the current site would change if there were land acquisition costs.

764
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:55,191
So the current cost of $38 million has a $10 million built in or no?

765
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:58,993
No, that's what would be for dual site at the present site.

766
01:03:59,593 --> 01:04:05,137
But the larger one, which I think is 49 million includes a $10 million land acquisition fee.

767
01:04:05,177 --> 01:04:05,257
Okay.

768
01:04:05,277 --> 01:04:10,260
I don't remember seeing that one, but was that part of what we would give a part of the original one?

769
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,100
49 million.

770
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:11,941
Yep.

771
01:04:12,981 --> 01:04:13,822
Thank you, Mr. President.

772
01:04:14,482 --> 01:04:15,423
Counselor Lungo Kern.

773
01:04:18,485 --> 01:04:18,545
Um,

774
01:04:19,026 --> 01:04:30,408
A few things with regards to, I know there's a number of requests and serious issues on the police side that need to be taken care of before this build out in two years.

775
01:04:30,488 --> 01:04:33,669
And I know that has been provided to the administration.

776
01:04:34,609 --> 01:04:43,511
So with regards to, is there any going to be anything done to the police station, current police station within the two year period to resolve those issues?

777
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:48,472
And then on the same token, we have now nine years before

778
01:04:49,733 --> 01:04:52,954
you know, possible nine years before a new fire station is built.

779
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:56,995
It'll be online before nine years.

780
01:04:57,495 --> 01:04:58,815
Well, 2017, 2025, eight, nine years.

781
01:04:58,855 --> 01:05:03,077
Yeah, but 2025 is again when a debt service payment would be made.

782
01:05:03,577 --> 01:05:05,357
So it could be two years before that.

783
01:05:05,577 --> 01:05:11,079
Point being, there's some serious concerns in station one on the fire side.

784
01:05:12,019 --> 01:05:16,080
What will we be doing for both departments in the meantime to make sure

785
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:29,992
living conditions and working conditions are up to par, such as the mold and the asbestos and the building coming apart with rainwater coming in.

786
01:05:30,032 --> 01:05:31,213
I mean, some of the living conditions.

787
01:05:31,353 --> 01:05:33,695
Are we going to put any money into either department?

788
01:05:33,755 --> 01:05:40,240
And I don't know if it's a question for you, but I would have to defer to either the chief of staff or the city solicitor.

789
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:45,964
Yeah, we can maybe get an idea on that, because not only that, but thankfully,

790
01:05:46,715 --> 01:06:04,923
If this all pans out, we have two years for the police, 789 for the fire department, and there's some, we discussed them last night, those issues I've already mentioned, plus the diesel trucks in with the kitchen, in with the equipment, you know, a number of different things that need to be addressed now.

791
01:06:05,683 --> 01:06:08,705
And I know, Chief, I know there's been a list given to the mayor.

792
01:06:09,085 --> 01:06:15,708
I don't know exactly what's on it, but when I walk in your station, I feel like it's unsafe for the officers that are in there.

793
01:06:16,243 --> 01:06:17,523
I mean, no bulletproof glass.

794
01:06:17,563 --> 01:06:20,284
I think maybe something's been put in recently, but not up to par.

795
01:06:20,724 --> 01:06:21,484
That concerns me.

796
01:06:21,604 --> 01:06:23,705
And we have two, two, two years before this is built.

797
01:06:23,905 --> 01:06:26,745
So on both sides, what are we, what are we, what is the city going to do?

798
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:28,646
Name and address for the record, please.

799
01:06:28,906 --> 01:06:31,147
Jennifer Dever, chief of staff to Maybrook 85.

800
01:06:31,467 --> 01:06:32,487
George P has a tribe.

801
01:06:32,967 --> 01:06:33,927
Mr. President, if I may.

802
01:06:34,487 --> 01:06:35,067
Good evening all.

803
01:06:35,648 --> 01:06:45,630
Um, to address Councilor Curran's concerns relative to what is going to be done between now and then in respects to the firefighter, uh, to fire headquarters, um,

804
01:06:46,696 --> 01:07:07,584
the chief and I have an active dialogue in respects to any kind of needs or concerns that may happen, um, that will happen relative to the working conditions, much like we've had with chief Sacco relative to the cleanliness of the fire, cleanliness of the police headquarters, in addition to the replacement of the windows for bulletproof glass.

805
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:16,388
So we will listen to, um, future concerns, current concerns, um, relative to the safety and the conditions of the fire.

806
01:07:16,858 --> 01:07:17,358
headquarters.

807
01:07:17,919 --> 01:07:26,183
Again, I'll state that we will work with the chief and we will work with the union as well to listen to these concerns and move forward much like we have, um, with chief Sacco.

808
01:07:26,823 --> 01:07:27,304
Thank you.

809
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:30,705
Name and address of the record please.

810
01:07:30,926 --> 01:07:35,148
Leo Sacco, chief of police, uh, resided 227 Elm street in Medford.

811
01:07:36,068 --> 01:07:40,731
Uh, I've been authorized by the mayor to make the necessary corrections in the police department.

812
01:07:40,751 --> 01:07:44,693
Uh, but obviously we're not going to do anything that's going to be a budget break.

813
01:07:45,501 --> 01:07:52,764
Uh, one of the items that we need is, is a, uh, the female officers locker room facility and a shower facility.

814
01:07:52,844 --> 01:08:00,146
And, uh, the cost of that, putting that into an old building, uh, would be prohibitive would make any, any sense at all.

815
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:02,087
So we have to make some minor modifications.

816
01:08:02,647 --> 01:08:04,768
There has been some bulletproof glass.

817
01:08:05,188 --> 01:08:12,911
I don't know if anything's really bulletproof, bullet resistant glass, uh, on the forefront windows that are on the outside and two of the lobby windows.

818
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:14,211
And, uh,

819
01:08:14,817 --> 01:08:22,243
You know, that, that was something that the mayor probably could have waited if she, where she decided to move forward with a new station, but she didn't.

820
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:27,427
She went ahead and authorized that purchase and it didn't come out of the police department budget.

821
01:08:28,427 --> 01:08:31,490
Uh, so things are being done to, to remedy the situation.

822
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:33,571
Nothing's going to make it perfect.

823
01:08:34,232 --> 01:08:42,258
Uh, but definitely there's, there's, there was a cleanup over a couple of weekend periods and we need to continue the maintenance recently.

824
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:49,484
the custodian that's been provided by the company has changed and is doing a much better job than what we've had in the past.

825
01:08:50,124 --> 01:09:01,871
So the place is a little more cleaner and that just a lot of work needs to be done and we're not going to spend a lot of money on, uh, we're not going to waste it, but the necessary repairs will be made.

826
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,112
If I can, if I, thank you chief.

827
01:09:05,573 --> 01:09:11,356
Um, if I could add a B paper that, um, I know the asbestos was cleaned up in the police department side.

828
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:20,306
If we can add a B paper that mold testing and air quality testing be done on the fire department, I think that's extremely one of the major concerns.

829
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:22,808
I mean, along with a whole list of others.

830
01:09:23,169 --> 01:09:33,116
But I think that's one of the major concerns that is causing potential or possible health conditions for our firefighters that needs to be addressed.

831
01:09:33,176 --> 01:09:37,099
I believe the asbestos in the mold has been remediation in the police department.

832
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:39,381
And that's one of the so the fire department.

833
01:09:39,501 --> 01:09:39,661
Yes.

834
01:09:41,105 --> 01:09:45,329
I mean, it would be great to do it in both, but we know work has been done in the police department.

835
01:09:45,409 --> 01:09:49,553
We have two, you know, depending on this vote, I think it needs to be done in the fire department.

836
01:09:49,573 --> 01:09:52,336
It needs to be done in the first floor and the second floor.

837
01:09:52,836 --> 01:09:54,117
So if we can have that as a B paper.

838
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:58,902
Name and address of the record, please.

839
01:09:59,499 --> 01:10:01,080
Gene Nuzzo, 35 Parish Street.

840
01:10:03,222 --> 01:10:06,025
I have a few points as they pertain to finance.

841
01:10:07,946 --> 01:10:20,497
We've talked a lot about Prop 2.5 and tripping Prop 2.5, but no one has mentioned at all the offset of the maintenance of the systems that are in place

842
01:10:21,357 --> 01:10:23,898
for the fire department if they wait another five years.

843
01:10:24,598 --> 01:10:30,880
I can't imagine that those costs will come down to continue to repair old equipment.

844
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:38,702
So there also has to be an offset value on the operating side of the equation that I don't hear being factored in.

845
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:45,044
I hear and I'm glad to hear

846
01:10:45,888 --> 01:10:50,729
that discussions are underway about additional maintenance to these facilities.

847
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:57,731
But respectfully, the City of Medford does not do a good job at preventative maintenance anywhere.

848
01:10:58,532 --> 01:11:05,954
So our buildings wouldn't be in the conditions that they're in right now for fire and police, the two sides of these facilities.

849
01:11:06,814 --> 01:11:11,155
if we had the proper preventative maintenance in place.

850
01:11:11,395 --> 01:11:16,896
So instead, we're doing these emergency repairs and these band-aid solutions, and they cost significantly more.

851
01:11:17,537 --> 01:11:19,057
So I'd be interested in hearing that.

852
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:28,899
Additionally, with respect to finance, we're talking about $18 million with respect to the fire department getting a new facility at some point.

853
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:32,440
I'm hearing five or so years.

854
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:39,305
The escalation right now for construction sits at about 5%, and it's upticking since 2009, 2010.

855
01:11:40,866 --> 01:11:43,007
It was in the negatives then.

856
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:44,268
It started to tick back up.

857
01:11:45,548 --> 01:11:50,070
And it looks like it's increasing about a percent, a half a percent, depending upon the year.

858
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:55,332
So five today, next year, five and a half to six, et cetera.

859
01:11:55,432 --> 01:12:01,775
And that doesn't include if the current administration under

860
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:08,785
If President Trump passes anything to do with infrastructure, you're going to see those costs increase exponentially.

861
01:12:08,865 --> 01:12:13,148
So everyone's saying $18 million, but it's significantly more than that.

862
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:26,038
So, again, I think there's a lot of complexities, and I respect that there are a lot of underlying issues that need to be addressed, but I think that also stresses the need

863
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:29,380
to really look at this overall.

864
01:12:31,421 --> 01:12:43,666
The other point I would make with respect to committees and work groups, I think it's pivotal and I'm glad to hear that the police will have representation among their membership as will fire.

865
01:12:44,506 --> 01:12:51,229
However, the mayor stood here last night and said it is potentially her intention to redevelop that property.

866
01:12:51,649 --> 01:12:53,490
So there should be some citizenry

867
01:12:54,192 --> 01:13:01,936
represented on that committee as well, because if that parcel is going to go up for redevelopment, voters and taxpayers should have a say as well.

868
01:13:02,057 --> 01:13:08,740
And right now we don't have a good venue to be involved.

869
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:13,143
We have some other committees that do a good job, but we don't have a citizen development committee.

870
01:13:13,183 --> 01:13:20,047
So if there are people at the table, there should be some folks that represent the general population to talk about

871
01:13:20,638 --> 01:13:25,060
who and how they may redevelop that lot if the fire department moves.

872
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:40,445
And the last point I wanted to make with respect to financing and schedule, in all of these conversations, these past few minutes, I've heard repeatedly about the architect, I've heard repeatedly about what construction's gonna be.

873
01:13:41,185 --> 01:13:43,406
I'm still not hearing anything about an OPM.

874
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:46,507
And an OPM will be able to help you guys navigate

875
01:13:47,126 --> 01:13:53,970
will help to determine some value engineering and we'll put together that schedule you're looking for very quickly.

876
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:55,511
So thank you for your time.

877
01:13:56,511 --> 01:13:56,911
Thank you.

878
01:13:58,412 --> 01:13:59,393
Counselor Dolo Russo.

879
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:00,913
Move the question.

880
01:14:00,933 --> 01:14:04,435
We have citizens still willing to speak.

881
01:14:04,475 --> 01:14:06,877
Counselor name address of the record, please.

882
01:14:08,217 --> 01:14:10,238
David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

883
01:14:10,799 --> 01:14:12,860
I just wanted to make a comment about the, um,

884
01:14:14,077 --> 01:14:16,919
cost of the dual facility.

885
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:24,682
I heard $38 million for a dual facility, and I know it would take a couple of years, and then I heard that it would be $10 million to purchase property.

886
01:14:25,302 --> 01:14:27,263
My question is, is it up to $10 million?

887
01:14:27,323 --> 01:14:34,307
Because if you're moving the facility and going to another area, is it really $10 million to purchase a piece of property?

888
01:14:36,008 --> 01:14:41,769
offsetting that cost, wouldn't you be redeveloping or selling the property that exists currently?

889
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:46,551
So really you're not looking at $38 million, I mean $49 million.

890
01:14:46,571 --> 01:14:51,032
You're looking at something that's much, much lower than what's being presented.

891
01:14:51,172 --> 01:15:00,234
And you won't know that until there's a cost analysis done on either the property you're currently in or both properties, the one that you're considering or the property

892
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:04,040
or the property that you're in right now and the property that you're considering.

893
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:09,043
Cause it just might offset, um, entirely and you're still back to the 38 million.

894
01:15:09,543 --> 01:15:10,663
So that's something to consider.

895
01:15:12,744 --> 01:15:21,728
When the clarification council, the administration's estimating 38 million if you stayed on site and then a potential up to 49 if we did not.

896
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:22,809
So, correct.

897
01:15:22,869 --> 01:15:23,029
Yeah.

898
01:15:23,229 --> 01:15:28,391
But if you did not and you went to another area, are you, are you seriously paying $10 million for a piece of property?

899
01:15:28,952 --> 01:15:29,472
And if so,

900
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,771
is your property worth $10 million.

901
01:15:32,331 --> 01:15:36,392
So if your property is worth $5 million, wouldn't you purchase a piece of property worth $5 million?

902
01:15:36,492 --> 01:15:37,553
It would make sense.

903
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:40,034
So you'd stay at the $38 million cost.

904
01:15:40,554 --> 01:15:41,254
That's number one.

905
01:15:41,654 --> 01:15:45,155
Number two, as far as the OPM, I've heard it a couple of times.

906
01:15:45,215 --> 01:15:52,678
Here's something that actually, if you read into this law, the Massachusetts law that was presented earlier, at the bottom of it, there is an addendum

907
01:15:53,469 --> 01:16:15,564
that basically clarifies the law allows a public agency to assign an existing employee to serve as its OPM provided that the designated employee meets or exceeds the minimum of qualifications set forth for retaining a private sector project manager and has experience in the construction and supervision of construction of building of similar size and scope of complexity

908
01:16:17,019 --> 01:16:19,980
as the project to which the existing employee would be assigned.

909
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,661
I don't know if that helps you or not.

910
01:16:22,021 --> 01:16:33,686
But if you read into that, if there's somebody that is on board right now that has had that experience, you could probably bring them in as an interim until you find the OPM that you need to get this project going the way it should go.

911
01:16:34,126 --> 01:16:39,429
Because I think everybody in Medford would agree that this is something that is incredibly important.

912
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:43,991
And we should have a state-of-the-art facility for both the firemen and the police.

913
01:16:44,231 --> 01:16:44,551
Thank you.

914
01:16:45,051 --> 01:16:45,311
Thank you.

915
01:16:47,432 --> 01:16:48,153
Councilor Marks.

916
01:16:50,116 --> 01:16:54,261
Mr. President, I was wondering if someone from the administration can clarify.

917
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:58,847
We were talking about the dates when we could get a possible headquarters.

918
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:05,135
Does the headquarters and the training tower have to come on board at the same time or

919
01:17:05,981 --> 01:17:17,607
Can the training tower be something that can quickly be arrived at, knowing that the nature of building a training tower is far less of an endeavor than building a headquarters?

920
01:17:17,788 --> 01:17:18,528
Is that something that?

921
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:19,088
Yes.

922
01:17:20,129 --> 01:17:29,394
I'd be happy to address that, because the discussion that I had with the mayor, other members of the administration, and Jeff Shaw in the course of the last few days.

923
01:17:30,715 --> 01:17:34,957
Let's segregate out what you consider to be the lesser of the two, obviously, which is the training tower.

924
01:17:35,689 --> 01:17:41,170
Uh, that could be done separately from waiting for a new fire department that does not have to wait that period of time.

925
01:17:41,970 --> 01:18:00,234
So it's, it's clear that that, that while they have, that will both be under the domain of the working group, that their recommendations on a training tower could easily and well precede, uh, their later recommendations, which I would presume would be later on the fire, uh, fire headquarters slash station.

926
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:01,534
Thank you.

927
01:18:02,395 --> 01:18:04,175
And Mr. Mr. President, maybe, uh,

928
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:06,731
uh, chief Gilberti can answer this question.

929
01:18:06,751 --> 01:18:12,876
Uh, we got, you know, we, we, we heard a lot tonight about the condition of the fire department.

930
01:18:13,196 --> 01:18:15,338
We know already the condition of the police department.

931
01:18:16,078 --> 01:18:20,381
Um, the fire department has a number of, uh, specialized, uh, equipment trucks.

932
01:18:21,342 --> 01:18:30,909
And, uh, if we're looking at a potential building in 2025 or 24, can you address a chief, uh, the need for additional space?

933
01:18:31,977 --> 01:18:42,239
We know the deplorable condition of the station, but the needs of the equipment needs and space is equally as important.

934
01:18:42,859 --> 01:18:47,380
Can you address what's gonna happen over the next eight years relative to the equipment?

935
01:18:49,241 --> 01:18:53,302
Are you asking me if we're gonna incorporate it into a new station, the additional space?

936
01:18:53,322 --> 01:18:54,162
No, storage need.

937
01:18:54,862 --> 01:18:58,803
We know even with the police department now, and that's one of the reasons, in addition to

938
01:18:59,330 --> 01:19:12,540
the condition of the building, uh, the, the fact that these buildings are no longer suitable because they lack the storage for our, our, our equipment, what's going to be done in the meantime, there's about seven or eight years span.

939
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:15,963
Well, if we have no way to put, I mean, we, we have to live with what we have.

940
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:17,344
Okay.

941
01:19:17,804 --> 01:19:19,025
We're as cramped as can be.

942
01:19:19,606 --> 01:19:20,867
I'm storing it.

943
01:19:20,947 --> 01:19:24,009
I'm storing equipment outside today.

944
01:19:24,189 --> 01:19:26,551
So the plans out to,

945
01:19:26,904 --> 01:19:28,345
continue to store equipment outside?

946
01:19:28,425 --> 01:19:29,326
Where else can I put it?

947
01:19:29,646 --> 01:19:31,167
I mean... That's what I'm asking you.

948
01:19:31,407 --> 01:19:32,248
Where else can I put it?

949
01:19:32,828 --> 01:19:34,670
We put as much as inside as we can.

950
01:19:34,690 --> 01:19:39,833
And we're losing storage when we lose the training academy, correct?

951
01:19:39,953 --> 01:19:45,397
I will lose two bays over there that we keep reserve equipment in, yes.

952
01:19:45,797 --> 01:19:49,160
And the anticipation is that equipment's going to just be stored outside?

953
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:49,220
No.

954
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:56,445
No, we're going to have to find... We're going to have to either auction off some equipment, some older equipment, to make room.

955
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:04,801
So there's really been no thought process in what we're going to do with this storage need?

956
01:20:04,821 --> 01:20:08,042
I mean, we haven't talked to DPW.

957
01:20:08,102 --> 01:20:11,243
We haven't talked to even maybe- We have talked to the DPW.

958
01:20:11,283 --> 01:20:13,623
There's no room down at the DPW to store equipment.

959
01:20:14,124 --> 01:20:16,104
And that storage is all outside anyway.

960
01:20:17,064 --> 01:20:19,585
I can't store a fire engine outside in the wintertime.

961
01:20:21,388 --> 01:20:22,569
What about the private sector?

962
01:20:22,629 --> 01:20:26,973
Is it possible in some of the garages on Mystic Ave or Commercial Street?

963
01:20:27,013 --> 01:20:29,936
Oh, maybe that is a possibility, but we haven't explored that yet.

964
01:20:30,796 --> 01:20:41,826
Well, I think, Chief, the reason why I bring it up, I think it's an important issue because I think we're centered around the deplorable condition of the buildings, but equally we're moving forward because of the lack of storage within these both sides.

965
01:20:42,146 --> 01:20:42,466
Agreed.

966
01:20:42,627 --> 01:20:45,269
And that's equally an important issue.

967
01:20:45,809 --> 01:20:48,512
And as you know, you don't want to, we saw what happened to the DPW.

968
01:20:49,113 --> 01:20:52,034
They left there because their garages were leaking and so forth.

969
01:20:52,334 --> 01:20:53,634
They left their equipment outside.

970
01:20:54,034 --> 01:20:59,615
And vehicles that were purchased two and three years ago were becoming rusted and a whole other host of issues.

971
01:21:00,015 --> 01:21:12,698
And the last thing I want to see, even though our equipment needs something to desire in the fire department, as well as the police department, I'd hate to see this equipment being stored outside, this precious equipment that we have.

972
01:21:13,218 --> 01:21:17,799
So I'd like to at least get some feedback on what are the plans over the next seven or eight years.

973
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:19,707
Thank you, Chief.

974
01:21:19,767 --> 01:21:20,087
You're welcome.

975
01:21:21,148 --> 01:21:21,468
Thank you.

976
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:24,490
Name and address of the record, please.

977
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:31,433
Thank you, Council President Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

978
01:21:34,855 --> 01:21:39,157
I've said many times, if the city needs it, we should just get it done.

979
01:21:40,318 --> 01:21:44,120
What I don't understand is, however, the building is only 55 years old.

980
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:45,501
It's brick and mortar.

981
01:21:46,427 --> 01:21:47,607
And now it's almost condemned.

982
01:21:47,667 --> 01:21:52,529
We have thousands of homes that are over 200 years old, and they seem to be in fine shape.

983
01:21:53,209 --> 01:22:00,292
How did this station or multiple buildings get to this situation?

984
01:22:00,312 --> 01:22:03,293
It seems like we have a maintenance problem for sure.

985
01:22:05,513 --> 01:22:06,054
Very sad.

986
01:22:07,574 --> 01:22:11,115
I'm now hearing the city's using new growth.

987
01:22:12,476 --> 01:22:15,577
We, the taxpayers, should get all that new growth.

988
01:22:16,568 --> 01:22:24,735
that new real estate tax to offset prop two and a half, or in this city it seems to be prop 2.49%.

989
01:22:27,637 --> 01:22:32,061
And give the middle class a break on the real estate, home real estate taxes.

990
01:22:33,022 --> 01:22:35,744
And now I'm here and talking about an override.

991
01:22:38,226 --> 01:22:40,608
It's never happened as far as I know in 02-155 Winchester.

992
01:22:44,173 --> 01:22:46,454
has had many Prop 2.5 overrides.

993
01:22:47,634 --> 01:22:51,735
But here, I don't think that would be a wise move against the real estate taxpayer.

994
01:22:55,696 --> 01:23:02,157
And I believe for every $20 million borrowed, it's going to cost us, the taxpayers, 50% more.

995
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:05,938
It would be a $3 million bill in the 20-year payback.

996
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:10,380
By the way, maintenance is still key.

997
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,060
If anything is done,

998
01:23:14,925 --> 01:23:22,507
If I was in charge, I would make damn sure that so much is put aside for maintenance.

999
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:30,250
Because the old high school on Forest Street will still be standing, and the new schools will turn to dust.

1000
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:31,931
Please adhere.

1001
01:23:32,091 --> 01:23:32,971
Thank you for listening.

1002
01:23:33,491 --> 01:23:34,451
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

1003
01:23:38,653 --> 01:23:40,793
Mr. Penter, I think you cut in front of that young lady.

1004
01:23:40,953 --> 01:23:41,534
No, we agreed.

1005
01:23:41,554 --> 01:23:42,034
Oh, OK.

1006
01:23:42,996 --> 01:23:44,076
Name and address of the record, please.

1007
01:23:44,136 --> 01:23:44,996
I wouldn't be that rude.

1008
01:23:45,697 --> 01:23:46,557
Thank you, Mr. President.

1009
01:23:46,597 --> 01:23:46,917
Good evening.

1010
01:23:46,937 --> 01:23:47,917
My name is Robert Pinter.

1011
01:23:47,937 --> 01:23:51,738
I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., a former member of the Saugus party.

1012
01:23:52,078 --> 01:23:58,239
I have some concerns as it relates to whatever this agreement might be between the city and the fire department.

1013
01:23:58,839 --> 01:24:09,081
And the one glaring thing that stands out with me is that the mayor is going to appoint a committee of fire personnel to work as it relates to a new fire station or whatever it might be.

1014
01:24:10,082 --> 01:24:12,042
Why didn't that take place for the police department?

1015
01:24:12,888 --> 01:24:17,951
If she's so concerned about the fire department, it's obvious that she was less concerned about the police department.

1016
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:20,733
And it's quite obvious by this particular writing here.

1017
01:24:21,254 --> 01:24:28,779
And it's more obvious because of the fact that no one from rank and file of the police union were part and parcel of where we're going with all of this.

1018
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:36,524
Second thing, as it relates to the location or relocation possibly of a new fire station, the chief is here.

1019
01:24:36,544 --> 01:24:37,485
He can answer for himself.

1020
01:24:37,525 --> 01:24:42,228
But last night, he indicated that the present location is the best place for the fire

1021
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:45,073
location here in the city of Medford for its headquarters.

1022
01:24:45,593 --> 01:24:53,575
So we take that into consideration because the talk seems to be supposedly getting a new fire station at a new location at a later time.

1023
01:24:54,175 --> 01:25:02,677
And then we go to point number four where the mayor says she's going to submit a loan order no later than the 2019 fiscal year.

1024
01:25:02,697 --> 01:25:07,258
That brings you up to May of June of 2020, no later than that.

1025
01:25:08,119 --> 01:25:09,239
But all you're going to be getting

1026
01:25:09,678 --> 01:25:13,140
is allegedly a proposal for one, a new station.

1027
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:16,642
And number two, you know, maybe what the cost is going to be.

1028
01:25:17,142 --> 01:25:25,407
There's no proviso in here as it's going to relate to how it's going to be paid for, whether it's going to be the Medford taxpayer, because we know right now there's no grants.

1029
01:25:26,267 --> 01:25:27,448
She's still looking for grants.

1030
01:25:27,508 --> 01:25:29,569
As she said last night, she's on the hunt.

1031
01:25:29,609 --> 01:25:31,890
And in some places there's no grants to be found.

1032
01:25:32,651 --> 01:25:37,193
So you're looking at Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer who seems to be the person that's going to be paying it.

1033
01:25:38,076 --> 01:25:41,918
So I think you have some financial concerns that really need to be taken into consideration.

1034
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:45,480
Nothing that's been discussed right now is an obligation of the city.

1035
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,602
It's a, is it's approximate $28 million pension deficit.

1036
01:25:50,182 --> 01:25:51,683
You folks haven't mentioned that yet.

1037
01:25:51,723 --> 01:25:57,246
And there's no upticking on paying that down at a faster rate because the interest rates keep going higher.

1038
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,487
The other night there was a contract.

1039
01:25:59,507 --> 01:26:06,030
There was a car, excuse me, there was a meeting as it relates to a multimillion dollar refurbishing of Medford high school.

1040
01:26:06,802 --> 01:26:08,763
It's going to cost factor that's going to have to come in.

1041
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:15,448
Most recently, this council voted on, and excitedly, for the Medford Library and a $20 million bond.

1042
01:26:15,508 --> 01:26:18,751
And if that comes through, there's a 40% payback on the city side.

1043
01:26:19,791 --> 01:26:22,633
These are things that really have to be taken into consideration.

1044
01:26:22,954 --> 01:26:33,401
And you, President Caviello, in your first term, on the second year of your first term, you introduced a document that talked about $1.3 million of necessary repairs on the six new schools.

1045
01:26:33,441 --> 01:26:34,802
That's up to almost $1.5 million right now.

1046
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:39,245
This city has a bad history of taking care of its buildings.

1047
01:26:39,805 --> 01:26:42,405
The private administration ignored all these buildings.

1048
01:26:42,985 --> 01:26:48,666
This city council is now being faced with altogether, all at once, a whole host of issues.

1049
01:26:49,527 --> 01:26:51,747
It's obvious that the priorities have not been set.

1050
01:26:52,507 --> 01:27:03,650
But the priorities of this particular mayor, her little baby, being this police department thing, and now with the fire department thrown in, she should be here discussing this and making her plea with you folks.

1051
01:27:04,630 --> 01:27:05,730
This is totally unfair.

1052
01:27:06,910 --> 01:27:23,037
You folks have never had an opportunity to discuss this issue, nevermind the location, nevermind the 35,000 square foot building, nevermind a three story building, nevermind the fact that if you put a combined operation there, according to Dunn and Sweeney, it won't even fit today's standards.

1053
01:27:23,457 --> 01:27:31,701
And if you look at the 600 plus pages of the report, it alludes to the fact that even if you were to build a new police station and leave the fire station alone,

1054
01:27:31,981 --> 01:27:39,384
what you're going to have is you're going to have mechanical problems that also will have code problems that will not bone up for the next 20 years.

1055
01:27:39,764 --> 01:27:42,205
And that's going to be a cost factor to take into consideration.

1056
01:27:43,105 --> 01:27:53,528
If you're talking about a possible 10 to 18 month period or 10 to 12 month period for a designer to come in and an OPM person hired first, everyone keeps forgetting to say that.

1057
01:27:53,789 --> 01:27:55,469
The OPM needs to be hired first.

1058
01:27:56,389 --> 01:27:57,510
Once you put that together,

1059
01:27:58,763 --> 01:28:01,024
Why wait and do an 18-month period for the fire?

1060
01:28:01,084 --> 01:28:02,785
Why can't you do both at the same time?

1061
01:28:03,505 --> 01:28:15,750
And if you do both at the same time, maybe you can work out a process that basically says you can build this station in increments as it relates to building a new police station and then working on the fire station.

1062
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:21,813
Because we all know on the fire station side of the building, the building is probably in better shape and a better condition than the police side.

1063
01:28:22,621 --> 01:28:26,464
But who's to say it isn't because nobody's gone through there and council logo hit it right in the head.

1064
01:28:26,504 --> 01:28:28,066
Maybe you should go in there and have any equality.

1065
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:32,750
Maybe that building should be reviewed for his aesthetic qualities and whatever it might be.

1066
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:40,436
You know, running around, not having any money from the outside and only dealing with nine, approximately $9 million in your free cash.

1067
01:28:41,317 --> 01:28:50,905
That doesn't leave, that doesn't leave an awful lot because then we can talk about your almost $8 million that you have in your water and sewer account for which Mr. And Mrs. Medford taxpayer.

1068
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:56,072
has been paying for, and a surplus just sits there, and there is no ongoing proposed work.

1069
01:28:56,912 --> 01:28:58,673
And you're hitting the taxpayers with that money.

1070
01:28:59,233 --> 01:29:10,018
You're also hitting the taxpayer with the CPA, the Community Preservation Act, which in effect is almost $1 million plus you're taking away from the taxpayers, and there is no known program for it.

1071
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:14,680
So how much can you keep going back to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and say to them,

1072
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:16,680
We're charging you for this.

1073
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,521
This is what the cost is going to be.

1074
01:29:18,961 --> 01:29:26,483
And readily acknowledged by our own treasurer, the fact of the matter is there's going to be some deficit mode as you continue to go forward that's going to have to be offset.

1075
01:29:27,524 --> 01:29:28,404
Who's going to pay for it?

1076
01:29:29,024 --> 01:29:33,025
Do you really want to tell the taxpayer you need a Proposition 2.5 override?

1077
01:29:33,766 --> 01:29:34,906
Do you really want to sell that?

1078
01:29:35,766 --> 01:29:38,507
And if everything comes before you, Mr. President, and before your council,

1079
01:29:39,419 --> 01:29:39,719
Okay?

1080
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:42,201
Where's the conversation as it relates to that?

1081
01:29:42,721 --> 01:29:43,922
Where's the priority going to be?

1082
01:29:43,982 --> 01:29:45,102
Is it going to be the high school?

1083
01:29:45,383 --> 01:29:46,403
Is it going to be the library?

1084
01:29:46,643 --> 01:29:47,884
Is it going to be the police department?

1085
01:29:47,904 --> 01:29:49,045
Is it going to be the fire station?

1086
01:29:49,945 --> 01:29:54,168
The fire chief made an excellent point, something I never even thought of, and thank you for bringing it up.

1087
01:29:54,748 --> 01:29:55,849
Talking about storage.

1088
01:29:56,770 --> 01:30:00,132
If you can't even store what you have on the property that you have right now,

1089
01:30:01,180 --> 01:30:03,001
Where in God's creation are you going to put that?

1090
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:04,843
He said possibly auctioning it off.

1091
01:30:04,883 --> 01:30:06,584
Two bays you're going to possibly be losing.

1092
01:30:07,284 --> 01:30:09,146
You talked about regionalization the other night.

1093
01:30:09,426 --> 01:30:12,728
The mayor readily said that we could possibly go to regionalization.

1094
01:30:13,149 --> 01:30:20,474
And I believe we heard the fire department indicate and say to you that if we did go to regionalization and we did take one of our trucks and a group of our guys to go there,

1095
01:30:20,674 --> 01:30:26,976
and to do whatever it might takes place at one of these fire academies, so to speak, there needs to be a backup here in the city.

1096
01:30:27,556 --> 01:30:29,597
And where's the backup to the backup in the city?

1097
01:30:29,637 --> 01:30:31,658
God forbid there's a major fire that takes place.

1098
01:30:32,418 --> 01:30:33,998
These are things that haven't been discussed.

1099
01:30:34,438 --> 01:30:39,160
That's what you folks should be discussing before you rush into this thing and say we want to go forward.

1100
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:43,201
There is nobody, not one person in this room that would be against a fire in the police station.

1101
01:30:43,321 --> 01:30:44,202
I don't think there's anybody.

1102
01:30:44,222 --> 01:30:45,322
It would all be crazy.

1103
01:30:45,682 --> 01:30:46,543
if there was one person.

1104
01:30:46,663 --> 01:30:54,269
We all recognize the fact that the need is there, but we also recognize the fact that the city has been extremely diligent in not maintaining its buildings.

1105
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:56,951
But there needs to be a priority that's set.

1106
01:30:57,532 --> 01:31:01,074
There has to be a goal set here, and there has to be a timeline met.

1107
01:31:01,575 --> 01:31:12,744
And if it's 2022 that was stated last night, now it's up to 2024 before you start to be making these paybacks, what's the cost going to be as it relates to the new station?

1108
01:31:12,804 --> 01:31:14,485
Mr. McCulloch made an excellent point.

1109
01:31:14,785 --> 01:31:15,866
And the point is simply this.

1110
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:21,431
If you have to buy another piece of property for $10 million, is the at-present property worth $10 million?

1111
01:31:21,551 --> 01:31:22,271
Are thereabouts?

1112
01:31:22,612 --> 01:31:29,557
And if it isn't, but it comes close to it, and between the sale and the taxes that it generates, it offsets the cost of where you might be going.

1113
01:31:30,298 --> 01:31:30,898
These are things.

1114
01:31:31,038 --> 01:31:31,799
And I thank you folks.

1115
01:31:31,839 --> 01:31:41,427
I think it was you, Councilor Langel-Kern, who asked to maybe go into executive session to find out who are these other people that the city sat down and spoke with as it relates to possibly moving it around.

1116
01:31:42,823 --> 01:31:48,467
You seem to forget one thing as it relates to where the public works department is, because we can't put any equipment in there.

1117
01:31:48,907 --> 01:31:51,168
But the new public works building was being discussed.

1118
01:31:51,369 --> 01:32:02,656
What was discussed before this council was building something that could be oversized, not only to handle public works, but to handle our other buildings, whether it be our fire trucks, our police cars, and whatever it might be.

1119
01:32:03,236 --> 01:32:05,378
And there was a pushback by the then administration.

1120
01:32:06,058 --> 01:32:07,660
Why there was a pushback, I don't know.

1121
01:32:08,120 --> 01:32:14,046
And there was also a thought process that told us we could just wrap the whole thing around public works, fire, and police.

1122
01:32:14,506 --> 01:32:22,473
And all you would be doing is asking and moving people that are presently there without taking their property, moving their property, so nobody would lose any space.

1123
01:32:22,694 --> 01:32:31,161
As a matter of fact, they'd probably have better space, they'd have front view space, but you'd still have the availability of a fire department that's right there in the middle of the square.

1124
01:32:31,982 --> 01:32:38,256
Police department, maybe move back a little bit one way or the other, but they can get around with their cars a lot quicker than a fire truck could.

1125
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:44,153
I don't think you should make a mistake by saying, no, we're not going to vote for this or yes, we're going to vote for that.

1126
01:32:44,694 --> 01:32:45,714
It's the process.

1127
01:32:46,315 --> 01:32:48,676
And once again, the process has been broken down.

1128
01:32:49,116 --> 01:32:55,160
It's been broken down because there's been no communication, a lack of leadership from the mayor's office with this council.

1129
01:32:55,661 --> 01:33:01,865
And all you folks are being required to do is to vote for this thing up and down with absolutely not an ounce of input.

1130
01:33:02,594 --> 01:33:04,995
And today is another perfect example of what took place.

1131
01:33:05,455 --> 01:33:14,358
If the fire department can meet with the mayor to get this resolution between themselves, then why wasn't the council involved before or after?

1132
01:33:14,978 --> 01:33:18,100
And who's to say that this mayor is going to be here in 18 months?

1133
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,261
That's the question.

1134
01:33:20,841 --> 01:33:22,263
And that's what you need to ask yourself.

1135
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:30,630
So why are you going out on 18 months when in fact, if you're going to be doing this thing for a police department, why don't you do it for a fire department at the same time?

1136
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:38,676
That way they'll have a better understanding and a better acknowledgement to the fact where the fire and police can be housed together like they were in 1962 and like the report said.

1137
01:33:41,058 --> 01:33:51,686
That report of multiple pages from Dunham and Sweeney going back to 2013 is probably the best example that you can have to tell you and to show you why a dual building should work.

1138
01:33:52,187 --> 01:33:58,472
But if not, and you decide to go separately in a separate way, that generates and should generate positive discussion.

1139
01:33:58,832 --> 01:34:01,594
And one last thing for Mr. Falco, Councilor Falco.

1140
01:34:01,954 --> 01:34:07,698
When you talked about that training tower, while it seems to be something that, you know, it's going to be there and might cost $500,000,

1141
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,221
But where in the city is it going to be?

1142
01:34:11,921 --> 01:34:13,382
And you don't want that to be regionalized.

1143
01:34:13,422 --> 01:34:17,643
Because if you want that regionalized, you're taking firefighters out of service, out of our community.

1144
01:34:17,803 --> 01:34:20,144
You're taking a truck out of our service, out of our community.

1145
01:34:20,364 --> 01:34:23,366
You're putting backup there, and there's nobody there for the backup.

1146
01:34:23,706 --> 01:34:25,167
And that's the problem that we're going to have.

1147
01:34:25,187 --> 01:34:25,787
Thank you.

1148
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:26,187
Thank you.

1149
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:35,491
Name and address for the record, please.

1150
01:34:35,751 --> 01:34:38,012
Joyce Paul, 8 Mason Street, Medford.

1151
01:34:39,658 --> 01:34:41,079
I'm not here to criticize.

1152
01:34:41,239 --> 01:34:46,801
I'm just here to express my opinion, my concern, and some amazement.

1153
01:34:47,702 --> 01:34:55,165
We all understand that we have major decisions to be made and that major money is involved.

1154
01:34:57,046 --> 01:35:00,908
I was a contracting officer for the federal government for 22 years.

1155
01:35:01,728 --> 01:35:08,271
I dealt with from the architectural services to the completion of the building.

1156
01:35:09,361 --> 01:35:14,625
I dealt with the new federal courthouse at Springfield, border stations, the Coast Guard building.

1157
01:35:15,906 --> 01:35:36,423
And I feel every time I come here and I listen to what goes on, we don't understand, we have misinformation, we have lots of questions, and it's very difficult for me to understand why things are happening with the mayor, if you will, offside,

1158
01:35:37,490 --> 01:35:41,751
and why you people most especially are being excluded.

1159
01:35:42,531 --> 01:35:48,453
We hired you, voted for you, in essence hired you to represent us.

1160
01:35:49,233 --> 01:35:53,474
And it seems like it is very unfair the way you are being treated.

1161
01:35:54,434 --> 01:36:01,556
And when you are being asked to, two weeks ago or last week, I was watching it on television, it was like,

1162
01:36:02,470 --> 01:36:02,870
$2 million.

1163
01:36:02,910 --> 01:36:06,372
You know, $2 million, like it's nothing.

1164
01:36:06,692 --> 01:36:10,974
Property taxes have gone up, I think, 35 years in a row.

1165
01:36:11,594 --> 01:36:17,117
And now, as I understood it, we definitely need the police station.

1166
01:36:17,157 --> 01:36:18,998
We've needed it for like 20 years.

1167
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:22,419
All of a sudden, out of nowhere, comes we need the fire station.

1168
01:36:22,459 --> 01:36:23,840
Well, I'm not disagreeing.

1169
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:28,642
But yikes, every time you turn around, there's this or that.

1170
01:36:28,782 --> 01:36:30,503
Then the mayor has some kind of meeting.

1171
01:36:31,505 --> 01:36:38,209
and something happens and the communication to me is just awful.

1172
01:36:39,109 --> 01:36:45,613
And when you are being expected to vote on things, this is not the way things should be handled.

1173
01:36:46,153 --> 01:36:51,196
The federal government wanted open, found that open government worked.

1174
01:36:51,918 --> 01:37:09,465
and I would suggest that we need some of that in Medford because we, the taxpayers, are going to pay for this and we like it to work and you are being held responsible for things that I think it's just very poorly

1175
01:37:10,205 --> 01:37:12,467
very poor management and I don't blame you.

1176
01:37:12,487 --> 01:37:19,833
I just think there's all this cloak and dagger stuff going on that's really not right and it's really not fair.

1177
01:37:20,473 --> 01:37:27,799
So I hope things get better for you because I hope things get better for us and things get a little bit better organized.

1178
01:37:28,099 --> 01:37:28,479
Thank you.

1179
01:37:28,559 --> 01:37:28,960
Thank you.

1180
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,281
Councillor Falco.

1181
01:37:32,302 --> 01:37:33,103
Thank you Mr. President.

1182
01:37:33,163 --> 01:37:35,745
I just wanted to go back to Mr. Petra's point about the

1183
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:37,731
regionalization of the tower.

1184
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:39,652
I'm not in favor of regionalizing the tower.

1185
01:37:39,672 --> 01:37:45,296
The questions I had last night were just basically, what are the disadvantages of regionalizing the tower?

1186
01:37:45,316 --> 01:37:48,318
That was it, but I want to keep the tower here.

1187
01:37:48,358 --> 01:37:51,560
I think it's advantageous to us.

1188
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:53,542
I think our tower's the regional tower.

1189
01:37:54,002 --> 01:37:57,624
Yeah, and it benefits our firefighters, so I mean, I want to keep the tower here.

1190
01:37:57,644 --> 01:37:58,445
I just want to make that clear.

1191
01:37:58,925 --> 01:37:59,245
Thank you.

1192
01:37:59,446 --> 01:37:59,706
Thank you.

1193
01:38:00,346 --> 01:38:04,389
On the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, as seconded by Councilor Knight.

1194
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:08,190
Name and address of the record, please.

1195
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:12,532
Bill O'Brien, present local 1032, office of 340 Salem Street.

1196
01:38:13,672 --> 01:38:20,735
Councillor Marks, I just wanted to clarify something or have something clarified, is that you had a very good question of when the fire

1197
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:23,578
when the fire headquarters could be built.

1198
01:38:24,298 --> 01:38:34,903
And I think that, you know, that wasn't the agreement that we, we worked out was that we're looking down the road for five years and not 2025 for a new fire station.

1199
01:38:35,423 --> 01:38:48,628
Um, and if the, if the treasurer can have that information, I believe what our understanding was, we could go out to bond, um, and have a fire station in the city by 2023 it's physically, it's financially possible.

1200
01:38:49,249 --> 01:38:49,689
Am I correct?

1201
01:38:51,029 --> 01:38:52,029
If I may, yes.

1202
01:38:53,150 --> 01:39:03,795
I think that there is a little sort of misunderstanding with regard to debt service versus ability to bond and start projects.

1203
01:39:04,295 --> 01:39:13,939
And so that does need to be clarified, that I do believe that we would be able to have a fire station certainly underway.

1204
01:39:14,039 --> 01:39:20,782
And I can't say when it would be completed, but 2023 would certainly be what was in the

1205
01:39:21,559 --> 01:39:26,881
what was being planned, I would, I would think five years out and a debt service payment would be in 2025.

1206
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:29,623
So everyone's on the same page on that.

1207
01:39:34,745 --> 01:39:35,405
Councilor Marks.

1208
01:39:35,865 --> 01:39:44,749
And that's precisely why I asked for, for a timeframe because I wasn't privy to the meeting this afternoon between the union and the mayor.

1209
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:50,272
But it's clear to me that they weren't on the same page because from what I heard tonight,

1210
01:39:50,608 --> 01:39:52,749
We're looking at more of 2024.

1211
01:39:53,189 --> 01:40:07,356
But needless to say, Mr. President, you know, to get everything lined up and to make sure that we're working on a process now where one didn't exist the last two weeks is extremely important if we're going to move forward.

1212
01:40:07,736 --> 01:40:13,618
So I think it's vital, Mr. President, that we get some type of timeline from the administration on this on this issue.

1213
01:40:15,079 --> 01:40:19,061
So I don't know if you know, I'm prepared to make a vote tonight.

1214
01:40:19,979 --> 01:40:27,906
I'll be quite frank, I am not happy, Mr. President, with the results that took place after today's meeting.

1215
01:40:29,107 --> 01:40:35,853
I still feel strongly that a combined center is the fiscally prudent thing to do for this community.

1216
01:40:36,574 --> 01:40:37,975
According to the $100,000 report,

1217
01:40:39,633 --> 01:40:47,097
that we commissioned for feasibility study back in 2013 from Dunham and Sweeney for the Meffitt Police and Fire Station.

1218
01:40:47,597 --> 01:40:50,539
They recommended a combined center.

1219
01:40:51,959 --> 01:41:06,547
Also, the mayor's transition team that was put together by Mayor Burke, the Business and Economic Development Committee, held countless meetings, met with the general public, and their recommendation was to sell the land and build a combined center somewhere else.

1220
01:41:07,327 --> 01:41:23,354
So clearly, Mr. President, we have not taken the recommendations of the mayor's transition team, and we have not taken the recommendations of $100,000 study that we commissioned, and we went off in a different direction, and with very little fanfare, very little input.

1221
01:41:23,754 --> 01:41:36,379
So I am not happy, but again, as I told the union reps today that contacted me, I will not stand in the way, Mr. President, but I think clearly for everyone's sake, for the unions, for the taxpayers of this community,

1222
01:41:36,688 --> 01:41:40,469
and for this council that we should have a timeline on this project.

1223
01:41:40,529 --> 01:41:53,394
I can't state it enough, Mr. President, because I don't want tomorrow for the union to pick up the phone and say, you know what, we didn't realize this was going to take place because you know, if we vote on our first reading tonight, there's no, there's no going back.

1224
01:41:54,254 --> 01:41:55,355
We understand that counselor.

1225
01:41:55,655 --> 01:42:03,038
And we, we did talk, we talked at length about a timeline and it's spelled out.

1226
01:42:03,358 --> 01:42:04,098
Now we can't,

1227
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:19,274
we can't predict about, you know, this fire personnel, the working group of fire personnel will be prepared in 18 months to make a recommendation to this, to the mayor of where a new head fire headquarters will go.

1228
01:42:20,074 --> 01:42:21,355
We will be ready in 18 months.

1229
01:42:22,155 --> 01:42:24,116
That's our timeline going forward.

1230
01:42:24,476 --> 01:42:32,440
After the 18 months by fiscal year 19, which starts a fiscal year starts June, July 1st of 2000.

1231
01:42:34,679 --> 01:42:41,965
18 so anytime between that we're looking to have this council vote on a bond for an architectural services.

1232
01:42:42,566 --> 01:42:50,572
That's what we're looking for with assurances from this administration that once we're done, do this and we're moving forward with the new fire headquarters.

1233
01:42:51,233 --> 01:42:55,116
That's, I can't predict month to month, you know, week to week or what goes on.

1234
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:59,079
And I, and I agree with you and maybe make sure you guys know what's happening.

1235
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:00,200
I agree with your counselor and,

1236
01:43:00,627 --> 01:43:09,871
And from what, you know, we're going to, you sat down and we talked to the administration and we're hoping that, you know, going forward, they're going to hold up their rent because we're going to make sure they hold up their rent.

1237
01:43:12,372 --> 01:43:12,692
Thank you.

1238
01:43:12,872 --> 01:43:13,212
Thank you.

1239
01:43:13,912 --> 01:43:14,773
Councilor Lugo-Kern.

1240
01:43:15,873 --> 01:43:16,453
I'll yield.

1241
01:43:18,694 --> 01:43:19,795
Name and address of the record, please.

1242
01:43:20,555 --> 01:43:22,796
Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street in Medford.

1243
01:43:23,676 --> 01:43:27,298
So I've heard a lot of people talking about the combined facility would be $38 million.

1244
01:43:29,244 --> 01:43:38,647
We heard at the debates that they got $10 million in Malden for their police station, and that this administration didn't apply for any because of time restrictions.

1245
01:43:38,727 --> 01:43:49,371
But if they had gotten $10 million for the facility, that would have brought our costs down to $28 million, which would be only $6 million more than they were talking about for just building a police station.

1246
01:43:49,859 --> 01:43:53,460
when we still have a fire station that will be looming over our heads waiting.

1247
01:43:53,960 --> 01:44:00,963
Do we have any assurances that there'll be time to file for grants for the fire station, or are we just going to pay full price for that one too?

1248
01:44:01,383 --> 01:44:10,426
Because I heard that they're very concerned about us as taxpayers having to shoulder these bills, but I haven't heard of any grant applications going out to help us.

1249
01:44:10,846 --> 01:44:11,906
to offset these bills.

1250
01:44:12,247 --> 01:44:13,507
I've seen grants for libraries.

1251
01:44:13,547 --> 01:44:15,708
I've seen grants for renovating sidewalks.

1252
01:44:15,728 --> 01:44:20,090
Yes, we're renovating sidewalks at a cost to the taxpayer of a quarter of a million dollars.

1253
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:25,632
So I would encourage, strongly encourage, and I hope that other people do encourage

1254
01:44:26,065 --> 01:44:32,072
The administration to go after these grants because we just left $10 million on the table for the police station at a minimum.

1255
01:44:32,352 --> 01:44:41,803
Perhaps there were more grants if we combined a police and fire station and we could be having a ribbon cutting or a shoveling for a combined police and fire station.

1256
01:44:41,823 --> 01:44:45,027
Can I ask you where this $10 million grant was?

1257
01:44:46,278 --> 01:44:52,061
When we had the debates, there was a Malden City Councilor who was overseeing it at the high school.

1258
01:44:52,081 --> 01:44:52,501
That was in Malden.

1259
01:44:53,021 --> 01:44:56,703
And he said that in Malden, they got $9.8 million for their police station.

1260
01:44:57,123 --> 01:45:01,805
So we know that the mayor is aware of these grants because she was present at the stage

1261
01:45:02,242 --> 01:45:04,763
and clapped vigorously at the grants that he received.

1262
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:10,504
And I would have assumed that a phone call to the mayor would have yielded details.

1263
01:45:10,704 --> 01:45:11,484
I'm not the mayor.

1264
01:45:11,844 --> 01:45:14,945
Had I made the phone call, it wouldn't have had any effect on this process.

1265
01:45:15,225 --> 01:45:19,426
I'm more than happy to make the phone call and call the mayor's office and let her know what the grants are.

1266
01:45:22,732 --> 01:45:32,455
What we need to do now is since we're clearly going to go forward on just a police station, before the fire tower is knocked down, a new location should be picked for that fire tower.

1267
01:45:32,836 --> 01:45:35,136
Money should be allocated for that fire tower.

1268
01:45:35,416 --> 01:45:42,279
The firefighters should be confident that in conjunction with their tower being torn down, a new one will be placed.

1269
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:43,119
They shouldn't wait until 2023 or 2024.

1270
01:45:46,658 --> 01:45:48,740
or 2022 or whenever to get their tower.

1271
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:56,287
They should get their tower immediately because as we're told our insurance rates will go up if they don't have a tower because they'll not be able to do training here.

1272
01:45:56,627 --> 01:46:08,999
And we also need to figure out where they're going to store their equipment because the very idea of the police, the fire chief thinking that he has to auction off equipment because he has nowhere to store it is chilling and upsetting to me as a taxpayer.

1273
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:13,893
I saw the reaction on some of the Councillors' faces and it was upsetting to them as well.

1274
01:46:14,154 --> 01:46:24,904
And that's something that would have been addressed had these meetings not taken place behind closed doors with a handful of people who all nodded in unison because they agreed with what was happening.

1275
01:46:25,185 --> 01:46:30,310
We need diverse voices at the table so that multiple layered conversations can take place

1276
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:33,272
And these things don't come upon us at the last minute.

1277
01:46:33,792 --> 01:46:41,058
So I encourage the administration to invite people to the table who will give her different ideas, and not just ideas that agree with hers.

1278
01:46:41,298 --> 01:46:43,480
That's very important to any administration.

1279
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,463
And I encourage a future administration in Medford to do the same.

1280
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:48,384
Thank you.

1281
01:46:48,404 --> 01:46:49,345
Thank you.

1282
01:46:49,945 --> 01:46:55,369
And I know the administration did state that they are looking for grants, both the federal and state level.

1283
01:46:56,470 --> 01:46:57,411
Counselor Longo-Chagran.

1284
01:46:57,971 --> 01:46:59,813
Thank you, President Carviello.

1285
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:10,151
I think I stated two weeks ago, this is probably the worst way anything's ever been proposed with regards to a bond in 16 years I've been on the Council.

1286
01:47:11,212 --> 01:47:26,115
I think the right way to do it is exactly what's written in the memo today, dated February 28th, where a working group will be set up and it will take 18 months to assess and figure out the best location and

1287
01:47:27,438 --> 01:47:30,360
figure out everything that's going to be needed for a new fire station.

1288
01:47:30,841 --> 01:47:33,202
That's the proper way to do business.

1289
01:47:33,342 --> 01:47:36,104
And that's what should have been done nine months ago.

1290
01:47:36,385 --> 01:47:38,366
It should have been open and transparent.

1291
01:47:38,987 --> 01:47:43,110
I'm having a tough time knowing really the position we were put in.

1292
01:47:43,210 --> 01:47:45,892
It's extremely tough to make a decision.

1293
01:47:47,253 --> 01:47:54,958
The lack of transparency, lack of communication, closed-door discussions, I feel like this is being shoved down our throat.

1294
01:47:58,562 --> 01:48:05,348
I truly feel that a dual facility is going to be the most fiscally responsible way to go.

1295
01:48:05,828 --> 01:48:16,897
And I think that has to take place after a few months of multiple, multiple working groups to figure out, number one, a working group to research grants.

1296
01:48:17,418 --> 01:48:25,444
The mayor stated yesterday that she's been in discussions with, I believe, Representative Donato, Catherine Clark.

1297
01:48:26,698 --> 01:48:32,260
What time has been put into finding a grant and are there grants out there for dual facility?

1298
01:48:33,441 --> 01:48:35,102
That needs to come first.

1299
01:48:35,582 --> 01:48:41,945
I would, for the taxpayers, we're under a lot of pressure tonight, one way or another.

1300
01:48:41,965 --> 01:48:45,846
Um, we're the, we're the ones that are trying to figure out the best way to go here.

1301
01:48:46,507 --> 01:48:51,529
And it is very upsetting how much we need a new police station.

1302
01:48:51,549 --> 01:48:54,130
And obviously now know the concerns of the fire station.

1303
01:48:54,574 --> 01:48:56,495
and this is still being pushed down our throat.

1304
01:48:58,056 --> 01:49:23,333
I don't know how I will vote if the questions move forward, but I think three months of multiple working groups, that be it the fire department, the police department, the administration, with the city council, with the people, with the taxpayers and the citizens of this community, I believe if everybody puts their heads together, we can figure out a way to rule out or continue on with a dual facility.

1305
01:49:24,252 --> 01:49:29,079
In a few months after cost analysis is done, Mr. McKillop is exactly right.

1306
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:30,901
What are the cost analysis?

1307
01:49:31,362 --> 01:49:32,503
We don't have any.

1308
01:49:33,024 --> 01:49:38,571
We were given five days before we could even ask any questions, and we were asked to vote on it.

1309
01:49:38,972 --> 01:49:40,574
Now, thankfully, we've got two weeks.

1310
01:49:40,634 --> 01:49:41,816
We've got some breakdowns.

1311
01:49:42,165 --> 01:49:43,766
We've got some questions answered.

1312
01:49:44,166 --> 01:49:44,886
We still don't know.

1313
01:49:44,926 --> 01:49:49,949
I think it was Councilor Scarpelli last night that asked, what other locations were looked at?

1314
01:49:51,249 --> 01:49:54,651
We can't be told until those property owners are discussed.

1315
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:57,332
That's something we should know before we take this vote.

1316
01:49:57,852 --> 01:50:03,675
And I know it's not what the police department wants to hear, nor should they have to hear it, because it has been too long.

1317
01:50:04,155 --> 01:50:04,975
But that's the truth.

1318
01:50:05,075 --> 01:50:08,417
That's the way this council should be moving forward.

1319
01:50:09,705 --> 01:50:25,388
for the benefit of the whole community and what is right, and for us to be completely 100% educated on a financial decision that is going to impact us for 30 to 39 years that our children will be paying for.

1320
01:50:26,969 --> 01:50:37,911
So I'm going to move that we take three months to create multiple working groups, and we get started tomorrow to figure out the right way to do this.

1321
01:50:49,388 --> 01:50:49,608
Chief.

1322
01:50:50,608 --> 01:50:53,309
Mr. President, Leo Sacco, chief, chief of police.

1323
01:50:53,329 --> 01:50:56,971
Uh, I just want to make a couple of comments.

1324
01:50:56,991 --> 01:51:03,073
So basically one major comment with regard to the grants, everyone's talking about all the grants that are out there.

1325
01:51:03,633 --> 01:51:07,875
I can tell you that been chief now a little over 26 years.

1326
01:51:08,855 --> 01:51:13,256
And a couple of weeks ago, I told you for the past 20 years, we needed a police station.

1327
01:51:14,297 --> 01:51:17,618
I can tell you at least once a week, I've been scouring,

1328
01:51:18,403 --> 01:51:19,804
different areas looking for grants.

1329
01:51:20,805 --> 01:51:22,266
No money was left on the table.

1330
01:51:22,586 --> 01:51:28,170
There has been no money, whether at the federal level or the state level, for brick and mortar construction.

1331
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:33,233
Absolutely nothing, because they believe that's a local issue that should be dealt with locally.

1332
01:51:34,454 --> 01:51:43,740
Malden, to the best of my understanding, received money because they relocated their police station to Eastern Avenue, the further end of the city.

1333
01:51:44,762 --> 01:51:47,663
And it's, I guess it's labeled as a redevelopment zone.

1334
01:51:48,064 --> 01:51:50,205
So they receive redevelopment money for that.

1335
01:51:51,465 --> 01:51:59,989
We don't have such an area, or at least I don't think we have such an area in our city, but I don't want anyone, people have come up to the podium and talked about grants and money left on the table.

1336
01:52:00,409 --> 01:52:07,593
I don't want the public to think that the city of Medford was negligent and not looking for funding sources because if it was out there, we would have nailed it.

1337
01:52:08,653 --> 01:52:12,075
Ladies in the back, please have respect for the chief on the podium.

1338
01:52:12,135 --> 01:52:12,415
Thank you.

1339
01:52:13,382 --> 01:52:14,302
That's all I wanted to say.

1340
01:52:14,322 --> 01:52:15,903
I just want to make sure the record is straight.

1341
01:52:16,403 --> 01:52:26,427
We have looked for grants for the, at least the past 20 years for a police station, either through block grants or through federal government, through the state and to private entities for grants.

1342
01:52:26,807 --> 01:52:28,308
There has been nothing out there.

1343
01:52:28,988 --> 01:52:30,568
So no money was left behind.

1344
01:52:30,648 --> 01:52:33,109
If there was, if it was out there, we would have been looking for it.

1345
01:52:33,630 --> 01:52:34,190
Thank you, chief.

1346
01:52:36,191 --> 01:52:39,992
On the motion by councilor DelaRusso is seconded by councilor Knight.

1347
01:52:42,013 --> 01:52:42,533
Mr. Clerk.

1348
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:52,715
The motion was made the first motion.

1349
01:52:52,735 --> 01:53:02,144
It's a financial paper.

1350
01:53:02,164 --> 01:53:10,432
If you could, Mr. Clerk, if you could make that as a beat paper.

1351
01:53:11,867 --> 01:53:17,530
We already have one B paper you gave already about the mold.

1352
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:22,812
Make this a C paper.

1353
01:53:23,072 --> 01:53:28,614
You take a three month study group, is that correct?

1354
01:53:29,515 --> 01:53:30,435
Multiple working groups.

1355
01:53:46,030 --> 01:53:49,712
On the, on the C paper, all those in favor.

1356
01:53:53,214 --> 01:53:53,935
All those opposed.

1357
01:53:55,015 --> 01:53:56,456
Roll call vote has been requested.

1358
01:54:02,180 --> 01:54:06,322
C paper is for the, uh, three for the three month work study group.

1359
01:54:06,442 --> 01:54:06,942
Counselor Knight.

1360
01:54:09,624 --> 01:54:10,905
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1361
01:54:13,786 --> 01:54:14,287
It would be a, uh,

1362
01:54:15,779 --> 01:54:29,228
a work study group of police and fire officials and residents to determine location, finances of all the police and fire stations.

1363
01:54:29,288 --> 01:54:32,450
Is that correct, Councilor Lohengrin?

1364
01:54:32,490 --> 01:54:37,474
And all the options available.

1365
01:54:42,797 --> 01:54:43,157
Thank you.

1366
01:54:43,318 --> 01:54:43,618
Thank you.

1367
01:54:45,881 --> 01:54:46,922
Mr. Clay, please call the roll.

1368
01:54:47,082 --> 01:54:48,062
Councilor DelaRusso.

1369
01:54:48,322 --> 01:54:48,543
Yes.

1370
01:54:49,643 --> 01:54:50,364
Councilor Fevella.

1371
01:54:50,444 --> 01:54:50,664
Yes.

1372
01:54:51,504 --> 01:54:52,024
Councilor Mayne.

1373
01:54:52,125 --> 01:54:52,305
No.

1374
01:54:53,645 --> 01:54:54,346
Councilor McCurdy.

1375
01:54:54,426 --> 01:54:54,626
Yes.

1376
01:54:56,207 --> 01:54:56,907
Vice President Montz.

1377
01:54:57,087 --> 01:54:57,327
Yes.

1378
01:54:58,008 --> 01:54:58,788
Councilor Scott Kelly.

1379
01:54:59,149 --> 01:54:59,369
Yes.

1380
01:55:00,289 --> 01:55:00,930
President Caviello.

1381
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:01,310
Yes.

1382
01:55:03,131 --> 01:55:05,392
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

1383
01:55:05,732 --> 01:55:11,275
On the B paper, that the city do a mold study in the fire station?

1384
01:55:12,376 --> 01:55:13,877
Mold and air quality in the fire station.

1385
01:55:15,449 --> 01:55:16,170
All those in favor?

1386
01:55:18,151 --> 01:55:18,891
All in favor and done.

1387
01:55:19,532 --> 01:55:20,232
Motion passes.

1388
01:55:21,633 --> 01:55:22,294
Councilor Marks.

1389
01:55:23,074 --> 01:55:29,799
I'm of emotion, but I did ask several times that we have a project timeline for both the police and the fire station.

1390
01:55:29,819 --> 01:55:29,999
Yes.

1391
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:34,963
If we could take a vote on that too, Mr. We'll have, we'll do it.

1392
01:55:34,983 --> 01:55:35,864
That'll be a separate paper.

1393
01:55:36,664 --> 01:55:37,425
That's fine.

1394
01:55:37,565 --> 01:55:37,985
That's fine.

1395
01:55:38,726 --> 01:55:41,888
On the motion by council marks that we have a timeline,

1396
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:43,800
Project timeline.

1397
01:55:43,820 --> 01:55:44,681
For both fire and police.

1398
01:55:44,721 --> 01:55:45,681
For both fire and police.

1399
01:55:46,061 --> 01:55:46,701
All those in favor?

1400
01:55:46,721 --> 01:55:47,641
Aye.

1401
01:55:48,161 --> 01:55:48,922
Motion passes.

1402
01:55:49,782 --> 01:55:56,923
On Councilor DelaRosso's motion that is take the first reading as seconded by Councilor Knight.

1403
01:55:56,963 --> 01:55:59,364
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1404
01:56:00,804 --> 01:56:01,785
Councilor Langlois-Kern.

1405
01:56:02,785 --> 01:56:05,305
I have these interruptions, Mr. President.

1406
01:56:05,325 --> 01:56:06,446
Oh, you interrupt all the time.

1407
01:56:07,006 --> 01:56:08,486
Councilor Langlois-Kern.

1408
01:56:08,566 --> 01:56:11,407
The C paper, I believe they kind of

1409
01:56:12,292 --> 01:56:14,293
The C paper and the main motion.

1410
01:56:14,373 --> 01:56:15,393
They are kind of contradictory.

1411
01:56:15,413 --> 01:56:16,114
Contradictory.

1412
01:56:16,134 --> 01:56:18,335
So maybe we can have a little discussion table.

1413
01:56:18,555 --> 01:56:19,335
I would move to table.

1414
01:56:21,036 --> 01:56:21,696
Uh, no discussion.

1415
01:56:21,736 --> 01:56:23,477
If I table what the bond motion.

1416
01:56:23,917 --> 01:56:24,077
Yes.

1417
01:56:24,137 --> 01:56:24,697
I'm table.

1418
01:56:24,717 --> 01:56:27,178
I don't, I think we've already tabled it once.

1419
01:56:27,238 --> 01:56:30,380
I don't think it is, uh, you can table at any time.

1420
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:31,240
You can't section 22 it.

1421
01:56:31,480 --> 01:56:34,661
I don't, I don't know if we can table that.

1422
01:56:34,701 --> 01:56:36,282
Mr. Sure.

1423
01:56:36,302 --> 01:56:38,403
You can table for a second time.

1424
01:56:38,423 --> 01:56:39,744
Third, fourth, fifth time.

1425
01:56:41,941 --> 01:56:43,182
It's the vote of the floor, Madam Presidents.

1426
01:56:45,403 --> 01:56:46,044
I moved to table.

1427
01:56:48,505 --> 01:56:52,388
Mr. President, if you will, uh, section 22 can only be invoked once.

1428
01:56:52,808 --> 01:56:56,010
That's under the, uh, mass general laws, section 22 of chapter 43.

1429
01:56:56,350 --> 01:57:05,416
The motion to table is separate from a request for it to invoke section 22 and emotion for table would require the acquiescence of the council.

1430
01:57:05,997 --> 01:57:09,119
Although the ruling is the chairs, but that is the back on council.

1431
01:57:09,279 --> 01:57:10,860
Council logo occurrence motion to table.

1432
01:57:11,610 --> 01:57:16,952
Seconded by... What's the reasoning for the table?

1433
01:57:17,192 --> 01:57:17,893
Just so I can agree.

1434
01:57:17,913 --> 01:57:34,480
I think it contradicts to paper C. If we're going to explore, create working groups to explore dual facility and different locations and get cost analysis, wouldn't it be contradictory to approving the bond?

1435
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:37,261
One is a resolution and one is a bond order.

1436
01:57:40,689 --> 01:57:42,010
The resolution would go to the mayor.

1437
01:57:43,970 --> 01:57:46,531
Right, so why can't we do both together?

1438
01:57:46,931 --> 01:57:48,192
Why can't we do both together?

1439
01:57:50,133 --> 01:57:52,894
Because they're contradictory.

1440
01:57:53,014 --> 01:57:53,954
It's not contradictory.

1441
01:57:54,934 --> 01:57:57,255
They're creating a working group while the process is going on.

1442
01:57:58,796 --> 01:57:59,916
I don't see that as contradictory.

1443
01:58:01,557 --> 01:58:03,498
On Councilor Longo-Kern's motion to table.

1444
01:58:05,478 --> 01:58:06,139
Do I have a second?

1445
01:58:06,739 --> 01:58:07,059
Second.

1446
01:58:07,379 --> 01:58:08,540
Seconded by Councilor Martz.

1447
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:09,420
All those in favor?

1448
01:58:12,204 --> 01:58:16,006
The chair seems to be in doubt.

1449
01:58:16,426 --> 01:58:18,267
Mr. Clerk, if you could please call the roll.

1450
01:58:24,751 --> 01:58:24,991
Yes.

1451
01:58:25,011 --> 01:58:25,071
Yes.

1452
01:58:25,091 --> 01:58:25,151
No.

1453
01:58:38,761 --> 01:58:39,942
2 in the affirmative, 5 in the negative.

1454
01:58:40,182 --> 01:58:40,803
Motion fails.

1455
01:58:42,805 --> 01:58:46,208
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso and seconded by an item for the main motion.

1456
01:58:46,248 --> 01:58:49,011
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll for the law and order.

1457
01:58:51,113 --> 01:58:52,894
Mr. President, please.

1458
01:58:53,175 --> 01:58:54,636
You do not get into the roll call vote.

1459
01:59:00,305 --> 01:59:01,845
He can speak as many times as he wants.

1460
01:59:01,865 --> 01:59:05,166
Mr. President, you just don't like me, so that's your problem, Councilor De La Russo.

1461
01:59:05,427 --> 01:59:07,687
The people out there have elected you people.

1462
01:59:07,707 --> 01:59:08,767
We're voting on the motion.

1463
01:59:09,328 --> 01:59:10,448
On your motion, Mr. President.

1464
01:59:10,488 --> 01:59:11,528
We are voting on the motion.

1465
01:59:11,848 --> 01:59:12,429
On the motion.

1466
01:59:12,469 --> 01:59:21,851
But apparently, as Councilor Longo-Kearns alluded to, it is contradictory to the point number C. Councilor Longo-Kearns, there's a resolution that will go to the mayor's office.

1467
01:59:23,472 --> 01:59:27,493
That will go to the mayor's office, which the mayor can decide to accept or decline.

1468
01:59:28,608 --> 01:59:30,369
It's not the mayor's privilege.

1469
01:59:30,409 --> 01:59:31,750
It's the council's privilege.

1470
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:34,511
It's your prerogative, not the mayor's.

1471
01:59:34,531 --> 01:59:36,833
We are voting on the loan order right at the moment.

1472
01:59:37,233 --> 01:59:38,854
On the loan order in and of itself.

1473
01:59:38,914 --> 01:59:42,236
It's your prerogative, not the mayor's prerogative.

1474
01:59:42,676 --> 01:59:47,359
And you've already voted on point number C, which is contradictory to the main motion.

1475
01:59:47,739 --> 01:59:49,900
We are voting on the loan order, Councilor Penta.

1476
01:59:51,181 --> 01:59:51,741
I think you better go.

1477
01:59:52,002 --> 01:59:52,282
Thank you.

1478
01:59:53,741 --> 01:59:58,663
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso and seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1479
02:00:00,024 --> 02:00:01,344
To take its first reading.

1480
02:00:01,664 --> 02:00:02,505
Councilor DelaRusso?

1481
02:00:02,525 --> 02:00:02,665
Yes.

1482
02:00:03,345 --> 02:00:04,025
Councilor Falcone?

1483
02:00:04,125 --> 02:00:04,205
Yes.

1484
02:00:04,765 --> 02:00:05,346
Councilor Knight?

1485
02:00:05,366 --> 02:00:05,666
Yes.

1486
02:00:06,166 --> 02:00:06,926
Councilor Lockhart?

1487
02:00:07,587 --> 02:00:07,807
Yes.

1488
02:00:08,947 --> 02:00:09,607
Vice President Marks?

1489
02:00:10,088 --> 02:00:10,348
Yes.

1490
02:00:10,928 --> 02:00:11,688
Councilor Scott-Bell?

1491
02:00:11,808 --> 02:00:12,028
Yes.

1492
02:00:12,789 --> 02:00:13,489
President Caviello?

1493
02:00:13,949 --> 02:00:14,169
Yes.

1494
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:18,131
The paper will take its first reading.

1495
02:00:18,771 --> 02:00:19,111
Thank you.

1496
02:00:21,828 --> 02:00:25,632
Suspension by Councilor Knight.

1497
02:00:30,316 --> 02:00:39,045
This paper is eligible for its third reading this evening, which is the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Education, Chapter 26.

1498
02:00:39,886 --> 02:00:43,149
Mr. Clerk, do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion?

1499
02:00:45,946 --> 02:00:57,731
Mr. President, I just wanted to say thank you to all the council members for your support.

1500
02:00:57,771 --> 02:01:04,414
I know that you've been, it's been a long grind, but you've always been supportive of what we needed in the police station.

1501
02:01:04,434 --> 02:01:06,215
I want to say thank you for that.

1502
02:01:06,335 --> 02:01:08,196
I want to thank the mayor for her efforts and

1503
02:01:08,615 --> 02:01:11,538
her staff, all the work that they've done in making this possible.

1504
02:01:11,958 --> 02:01:18,544
But one group I have to note is the police officers, the patrol officers and the superiors.

1505
02:01:19,445 --> 02:01:21,907
They made this a front burner item and they kept it there.

1506
02:01:22,367 --> 02:01:23,968
And they deserve a lot of credit for it.

1507
02:01:24,009 --> 02:01:27,071
That's like we heard the other night about a home.

1508
02:01:27,431 --> 02:01:28,172
That's their home.

1509
02:01:28,252 --> 02:01:30,674
So again, thank you.

1510
02:01:30,714 --> 02:01:32,096
And I want to thank all of them as well.

1511
02:01:32,176 --> 02:01:32,416
Thanks.

1512
02:01:40,805 --> 02:01:41,065
Yeah.

1513
02:01:41,125 --> 02:01:42,025
One more question, Mr. President.

1514
02:01:43,146 --> 02:01:47,329
Walter Buckley, Vice President, Local 1032, 340 Salem Street.

1515
02:01:48,530 --> 02:01:56,275
I just want to thank the councilors that were in favor of at least taking the two weeks to consider and answer some questions that we had.

1516
02:01:57,555 --> 02:02:05,040
Unfortunately, it didn't come out in our favor tonight, but we want to thank you who put the time and effort into answering our questions.

1517
02:02:06,181 --> 02:02:08,142
And that's all I got.

1518
02:02:08,443 --> 02:02:08,703
Thank you.

1519
02:02:11,018 --> 02:02:17,984
15, 16, 5, 7, 4, as offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, that it take its third reading this evening.

1520
02:02:18,004 --> 02:02:20,666
Roll call.

1521
02:02:20,686 --> 02:02:21,727
Roll call, Mr. Clerk.

1522
02:02:22,488 --> 02:02:22,608
Sorry?

1523
02:02:22,628 --> 02:02:23,168
Move approval.

1524
02:02:23,909 --> 02:02:24,510
Move approval.

1525
02:02:25,550 --> 02:02:26,171
Roll call vote.

1526
02:02:26,211 --> 02:02:26,912
Mr. President.

1527
02:02:28,673 --> 02:02:29,434
Councilor Marks.

1528
02:02:30,875 --> 02:02:34,898
Maybe for the edification of the audience, they don't really know what this paper is about.

1529
02:02:34,918 --> 02:02:36,660
You want to give a brief synopsis?

1530
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:36,880
Yes.

1531
02:02:37,622 --> 02:02:47,246
This paper is in regards to Tufts University notifying the city of Medford of all their students that are living in the city.

1532
02:02:47,926 --> 02:02:52,688
And the address is and how many people are living in each apartment.

1533
02:02:52,708 --> 02:03:03,892
So if there are any code violations that our code enforcement officer will be able to rectify them so we don't have any further tragedies going forward like we had seven years ago.

1534
02:03:06,350 --> 02:03:07,330
Well said, Mr. President.

1535
02:03:07,811 --> 02:03:11,612
If I could, I want to thank the Ad Hoc Education Committee.

1536
02:03:11,632 --> 02:03:17,654
I think it was chaired by Councilor Falco, Councilor Cohen, and Councilor Scarpelli.

1537
02:03:18,675 --> 02:03:32,039
They did yeoman's work in an issue that's been lingering in this community for a number of years, and one that has an impact on neighborhoods that abut, in particular, Tufts University.

1538
02:03:33,903 --> 02:03:53,053
The issues that are involved, Mr. President, this is not gonna solve all the issues, but as was mentioned in the subcommittee meeting, it's gonna be another tool in the toolbox to allow our code enforcement officers to be proactive in some cases and reactive in other cases.

1539
02:03:53,613 --> 02:03:56,374
So I see this as a good step forward.

1540
02:03:57,035 --> 02:04:01,477
As I stated at the meeting, Mr. President, I think we need something citywide.

1541
02:04:02,358 --> 02:04:07,061
And this is an issue that impacts every segment of this community.

1542
02:04:07,401 --> 02:04:16,526
We have illegal basement apartments, illegal attic apartments, and at some point it's a quality of life issue in all our neighborhoods.

1543
02:04:16,986 --> 02:04:20,068
So I'm thankful of the subcommittee's work on this.

1544
02:04:20,408 --> 02:04:23,890
I'm thankful for the neighbors that showed up at each of the meetings.

1545
02:04:24,288 --> 02:04:27,629
to express their opinions on this very issue, Mr. President.

1546
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:52,680
And I'm thankful that we now have a tool like Somerville in Boston that will allow us to not only safeguard neighborhoods and the quality of life in a neighborhood, but also, Mr. President, safeguard the students that are living within these apartments, Mr. President, that landlords don't have any care regarding the number of people they're trying to

1547
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,181
cram into an apartment.

1548
02:04:54,901 --> 02:05:04,729
Uh, so I look forward to the implementation of this and eventual use as a, an effective tool for, uh, the neighbors of salt method in the hillside area.

1549
02:05:06,771 --> 02:05:07,111
Thank you.

1550
02:05:07,291 --> 02:05:11,274
Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1551
02:05:11,354 --> 02:05:12,095
I'll be very brief.

1552
02:05:12,115 --> 02:05:14,196
I just want to thank my subcommittee members as well.

1553
02:05:14,396 --> 02:05:19,200
And, uh, the committee as a whole, because at some point this did go to committee as a whole as well.

1554
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:21,422
And there were a lot of great questions that were asked.

1555
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:45,685
and just thank the City Solicitor Rumley and John Babuso, our Code Enforcement Officer as well, but also to thank the neighbors that showed up to the meetings, that attended the meetings, and that there are some neighbors that are here tonight that just want to assure that this gets through, and I'm confident that it will, and I think that, like Councilor Mark said, this is another tool that the,

1556
02:05:46,588 --> 02:05:50,830
that the code enforcement officer has to keep our neighborhoods safe.

1557
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:52,011
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

1558
02:05:52,131 --> 02:05:52,451
Thank you.

1559
02:05:52,991 --> 02:05:53,552
Councilor Knight.

1560
02:05:54,012 --> 02:06:02,796
Mr. President, I think it's also important to point out the work of Barbara Rubel and Rocco DiRico and their work with the council in ensuring that this is an ordinance that is going to be operational.

1561
02:06:03,116 --> 02:06:09,419
So I'd like to thank the work of the Tufts University Community Affairs Office, especially Mr. DiRico, who's here in the audience this evening.

1562
02:06:09,780 --> 02:06:12,801
A lot of work was done by a lot of people on this very good mission.

1563
02:06:13,101 --> 02:06:14,302
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1564
02:06:15,762 --> 02:06:16,862
Councilor DelaRusso?

1565
02:06:16,962 --> 02:06:17,282
Yes.

1566
02:06:17,723 --> 02:06:18,423
Councilor Falco?

1567
02:06:18,483 --> 02:06:18,763
Yes.

1568
02:06:19,183 --> 02:06:19,723
Councilor Nye?

1569
02:06:19,823 --> 02:06:20,183
Yes.

1570
02:06:20,583 --> 02:06:21,384
Councilor Kern?

1571
02:06:21,424 --> 02:06:21,584
Yes.

1572
02:06:22,184 --> 02:06:22,944
Vice President Mox?

1573
02:06:23,224 --> 02:06:23,504
Yes.

1574
02:06:23,884 --> 02:06:24,684
Councilor Scarpelli?

1575
02:06:24,745 --> 02:06:25,025
Yes.

1576
02:06:25,565 --> 02:06:26,285
President Caviello?

1577
02:06:26,345 --> 02:06:26,585
Yes.

1578
02:06:26,945 --> 02:06:27,885
Seven in the affirmative.

1579
02:06:28,245 --> 02:06:29,186
Motion passes.

1580
02:06:29,206 --> 02:06:34,107
Motion by Councilor Nye to revert back to regular business.

1581
02:06:35,027 --> 02:06:37,108
17085 offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1582
02:06:37,918 --> 02:06:48,123
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be updated with regards to how the plans for the potential new police station were presented to the public last week and how they were paid for.

1583
02:06:48,603 --> 02:06:49,764
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1584
02:06:51,284 --> 02:06:53,085
Thank you, President Carviello.

1585
02:06:53,325 --> 02:06:56,787
Some of these questions were answered last night during our Committee of the Whole meeting.

1586
02:06:57,227 --> 02:07:01,209
It looks like Donovan Sweeney was paid $150 an hour.

1587
02:07:01,229 --> 02:07:03,050
They estimated less than $10,000 has been spent

1588
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:09,490
for their services thus far.

1589
02:07:09,630 --> 02:07:18,112
So if we could just get the only question now that needs to be answered is where did that $10,000, what account or which line item did that $10,000 come from?

1590
02:07:18,132 --> 02:07:25,814
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Lockern, that we find out where the $10,000, what account the $10,000 came from.

1591
02:07:26,615 --> 02:07:27,895
Although, do we have a second?

1592
02:07:30,435 --> 02:07:31,616
Seconded by Councilor Marks.

1593
02:07:31,696 --> 02:07:32,376
All those in favor?

1594
02:07:32,396 --> 02:07:32,536
Aye.

1595
02:07:32,876 --> 02:07:32,956
Aye.

1596
02:07:33,416 --> 02:07:34,356
All those opposed?

1597
02:07:34,576 --> 02:07:34,677
Aye.

1598
02:07:35,517 --> 02:07:36,317
Motion passes.

1599
02:07:39,369 --> 02:07:51,218
17088, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request MassDOT take the appropriate steps to have the graffiti at Roosevelt Circle removed.

1600
02:07:51,318 --> 02:07:51,939
Councilor Knight.

1601
02:07:51,959 --> 02:07:53,980
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1602
02:07:54,300 --> 02:07:57,263
Apparently this quarter it's my turn to bring this resolution forward.

1603
02:07:57,303 --> 02:08:07,931
I think one of us at one time or another have taken the opportunity to bring this resolution forward and request that the Massachusetts Highway Department, MassDOT, come down and beautify the retaining wall

1604
02:08:08,338 --> 02:08:12,401
along Roosevelt Circle, which is right now plagued with very pretty pink graffiti.

1605
02:08:13,081 --> 02:08:18,205
So, Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues support me in sending a correspondence to MassDOT requesting that that issue be resolved.

1606
02:08:18,865 --> 02:08:25,390
And if we could maybe send it to Councilor, Representative Donato, that is his district, for his help.

1607
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:25,630
Seconded.

1608
02:08:26,931 --> 02:08:28,472
Seconded by Councilor Alango-Kern.

1609
02:08:29,252 --> 02:08:30,273
Name and address for the record.

1610
02:08:30,493 --> 02:08:31,774
Castanetti, Cushing Street.

1611
02:08:32,094 --> 02:08:34,496
Thank you, Councilor Knight, for bringing up graffiti.

1612
02:08:34,536 --> 02:08:36,877
Sometimes it is a problem, visually to the eyes.

1613
02:08:38,398 --> 02:08:50,184
On the other hand, it's more important that the state, whoever's in charge, around that circle, the N93, getting on and off, going up towards Wright's Pond.

1614
02:08:51,084 --> 02:08:58,468
That area, a lot of times, is overgrown with kind of like trees that are wild.

1615
02:08:58,988 --> 02:09:03,410
And it's a visual obstruction to the drivers.

1616
02:09:04,032 --> 02:09:07,615
And that's not an easy place to negotiate vehicles back and forth.

1617
02:09:08,135 --> 02:09:09,096
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1618
02:09:09,116 --> 02:09:09,496
That's correct.

1619
02:09:09,536 --> 02:09:15,941
Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper and request that the Massachusetts Highway Department submit to the Memphis City Council a maintenance schedule for the area.

1620
02:09:16,201 --> 02:09:16,522
Thank you.

1621
02:09:16,822 --> 02:09:18,623
Do we have a second on Councilor Knight's motion?

1622
02:09:19,624 --> 02:09:21,045
Seconded by Councilor De La Russa.

1623
02:09:21,065 --> 02:09:21,726
All those in favor?

1624
02:09:22,638 --> 02:09:25,480
Motion passes.

1625
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:26,601
17-089, offered by Councilor Knight.

1626
02:09:26,981 --> 02:09:34,486
Be it resolved that the City Solicitor provide an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a through way.

1627
02:09:34,646 --> 02:09:35,306
Councilor Knight.

1628
02:09:35,686 --> 02:09:37,027
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1629
02:09:37,347 --> 02:09:44,292
As the Council and the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinances begins its discussion on zoning, one of the concerns that's been raised is the

1630
02:09:45,041 --> 02:09:58,071
number of commercial and industrial parcels that are coming off the rolls with residential development and the city's future ability to provide an equitable tax shift from the residential tax burden to the commercial and industrial properties, Mr. President.

1631
02:09:58,832 --> 02:10:09,820
So with that being said, there are certain streets in the vicinity of large commercial developments, such as the Meadowglen Mall, Linden Street being one, that is a dead-end street that abuts the private property of the Meadowglen Mall site.

1632
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:13,403
And I'm asking the city solicitor, with the support of this council hopefully,

1633
02:10:14,153 --> 02:10:26,887
To provide us with an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a thruway for the purpose of future examination of developing a strong commercial or industrial based district down there for tax revenue purposes, Mr. President.

1634
02:10:26,947 --> 02:10:36,437
We've talked with some of the neighbors in the area, some of the residents and property owners on the street, and it's something that they've expressed concern about for a number of years in terms of making Linden Street a thruway.

1635
02:10:37,144 --> 02:10:45,407
Also, currently, at the present time, there is a construction fence that is up at the end of the dead-end roadway, Mr. President.

1636
02:10:45,768 --> 02:11:04,655
And in previous years past, due to the involvement and efforts of Fire Chief McCabe at the time, there was a breakaway fence that was put there for public safety purposes so that if there was ever a situation where fire trucks could not enter Linden Street from the Riverside Ave side of the property, they would be able to do so through the abutting property of Meadowland Mall, Mr. President.

1637
02:11:05,296 --> 02:11:06,457
So I'd ask that this paper be approved.

1638
02:11:06,517 --> 02:11:08,019
I'd ask my council colleagues to support it.

1639
02:11:08,039 --> 02:11:11,142
And as we move forward, I look forward to updating you with any information that we receive.

1640
02:11:11,162 --> 02:11:12,223
Thank you.

1641
02:11:12,263 --> 02:11:12,883
Council Member Kern.

1642
02:11:13,043 --> 02:11:13,424
Thank you.

1643
02:11:13,744 --> 02:11:16,847
President Carviello, I don't mind getting an opinion on this.

1644
02:11:16,927 --> 02:11:24,033
I just do want to point out there are neighbors that have reached out to me within the last week, curious why this was on.

1645
02:11:24,093 --> 02:11:30,780
And they're, you know, I don't know if they're necessarily opposed to it, but they had very grave concerns of opening up Linden Street.

1646
02:11:31,766 --> 02:11:40,852
I just wanted to point that out, and an opinion is fine, but whether or not we do it, I definitely think it's something that we need to get that whole neighborhood involved with before we move forward on anything.

1647
02:11:42,032 --> 02:11:42,633
Councilor Nice.

1648
02:11:42,793 --> 02:11:53,079
I'd certainly make myself readily available to any constituent that has a question about a piece of paper or legislation that I've put forward, so they're always more than welcome to contact me directly as well, Mr. President.

1649
02:11:53,219 --> 02:11:53,599
Thank you.

1650
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:59,003
On the motion by Councilor Nice, as seconded by Councilor Falco, all those in favor.

1651
02:11:59,883 --> 02:12:00,544
The motion is.

1652
02:12:02,357 --> 02:12:09,882
Be it resolved that the city solicitor provide an opinion as to what steps are required to make Linden Street a through way.

1653
02:12:09,962 --> 02:12:15,225
There's currently a gate at the end because it will go on to private property.

1654
02:12:16,466 --> 02:12:19,808
There's a fire gate which the fire department has the keys to.

1655
02:12:23,550 --> 02:12:31,295
Whether that gate can come down and that public street can go on to private property.

1656
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:34,001
No, we're just asking for an opinion.

1657
02:12:35,102 --> 02:12:35,543
An opinion.

1658
02:12:39,266 --> 02:12:39,426
Yes.

1659
02:12:41,047 --> 02:12:44,290
On the motion by Councilor Knight is seconded by Councilor Falco.

1660
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:45,071
All those in favor?

1661
02:12:46,292 --> 02:12:47,593
All those opposed?

1662
02:12:48,333 --> 02:12:50,575
Motion passes.

1663
02:12:50,595 --> 02:12:52,577
17-090 offered by Councilor Knight.

1664
02:12:53,178 --> 02:12:55,820
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request

1665
02:12:56,407 --> 02:13:02,750
a cost estimate for the repointing of the wall and replacement of the wrought iron gates at Royal Park.

1666
02:13:02,930 --> 02:13:03,651
Councillor Knight.

1667
02:13:04,131 --> 02:13:05,411
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1668
02:13:05,471 --> 02:13:09,573
It's been brought to my attention that the gates down at Royal Park were removed.

1669
02:13:09,893 --> 02:13:18,037
And the reason that they were removed was because for a number of years they were not being utilized as open and closed as often as they have been in recent past.

1670
02:13:18,858 --> 02:13:22,600
The infrastructure wasn't able to sustain the ongoing use.

1671
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:23,340
I believe the,

1672
02:13:24,221 --> 02:13:30,166
gates were put up sometime in the 20s according to some of the research that Mr. Lincoln and the friends of the Royal House and the slave quarters have done.

1673
02:13:30,546 --> 02:13:34,709
So with that being said, Mr. President, there were innate gates that did serve a purpose.

1674
02:13:34,889 --> 02:13:37,391
I feel as though it's something that should go back up.

1675
02:13:37,431 --> 02:13:49,340
I feel as though the rotating wall surrounding Royal Park is in disrepair at this point in time and a cost estimate as to what it would take to repoint the brick wall and put up the wrought iron gates is the subject matter of this resolution.

1676
02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:50,341
Thank you.

1677
02:13:50,461 --> 02:13:51,882
Counselor Falco.

1678
02:13:53,435 --> 02:13:54,095
I'll yield to that.

1679
02:13:54,475 --> 02:13:57,737
Councilor Feckel, we yield to the gentleman at the podium.

1680
02:13:58,097 --> 02:13:59,798
Thank you, Tom Lincoln.

1681
02:13:59,838 --> 02:14:03,479
I'm the executive director of the Royal House and Slave Quarters at 15 George Street.

1682
02:14:03,539 --> 02:14:06,881
We've been a neighbor of the park for well over 100 years.

1683
02:14:06,901 --> 02:14:09,742
It wasn't there then, but sometimes it feels like it.

1684
02:14:10,142 --> 02:14:16,785
In fact, I believe the park was actually either given or sold to the city of Medford in the 1920s as part of the royal estate.

1685
02:14:17,125 --> 02:14:22,367
We get a lot of visitors from out of town that come to Medford to visit the Royal House and Slave Quarters.

1686
02:14:23,046 --> 02:14:34,313
I had a few comments about the state of the gates in the park, and we'd certainly like to see this done, and we greatly appreciate Councillor Knight's resolution along these lines.

1687
02:14:34,333 --> 02:14:47,581
You may recall, just as a piece of this, that there was an auto accident on the main street side of the park sometime in the last 10 years, I would guess, which caused a lot of damage, and that was repaired.

1688
02:14:47,662 --> 02:14:51,584
But the masonry, including the low base of some of the wall,

1689
02:14:52,615 --> 02:14:54,556
on the George Street side is not in good shape.

1690
02:14:54,776 --> 02:15:05,319
In addition, we share a common border, a common boundary with the park, a mixed masonry and historic wooden fence.

1691
02:15:05,679 --> 02:15:17,622
And we've actually had some discussion previously with the DPW and the city about working on that, which we intend to revisit.

1692
02:15:17,862 --> 02:15:19,763
We'd be delighted, as neighbours,

1693
02:15:21,407 --> 02:15:26,569
sort of historic co-owners, shall we say, to see some progress on this.

1694
02:15:26,609 --> 02:15:37,833
I'm sure the gates, I assume the gates have been stored someplace and could be put up, but I had not realized that the state of the masonry was the main reason that they were removed.

1695
02:15:38,293 --> 02:15:38,813
So thank you.

1696
02:15:40,014 --> 02:15:40,674
Councilor Felco.

1697
02:15:40,894 --> 02:15:41,714
Thank you, Mr. President.

1698
02:15:41,734 --> 02:15:49,497
Mr. Lincoln, if I can ask you a quick question, just because while we're on the topic of the royal house, um, you know, it's, it's a historic,

1699
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:54,426
It's something that people drive by, and it's part of Medford.

1700
02:15:54,686 --> 02:15:57,269
And it's been here for hundreds of years.

1701
02:15:59,111 --> 02:16:00,812
But if you drive by at night, you never know it was there.

1702
02:16:01,213 --> 02:16:05,497
So my question is, has there ever been lighting in the front?

1703
02:16:05,517 --> 02:16:06,538
Because I don't know if there has.

1704
02:16:10,207 --> 02:16:14,711
Is there any thought of actually reinstalling lighting or putting lighting in so people can see it at night?

1705
02:16:14,951 --> 02:16:15,391
Yeah.

1706
02:16:15,892 --> 02:16:19,474
I know this question was raised earlier, and I think I sent a letter to the council about it.

1707
02:16:19,875 --> 02:16:23,338
I think Jay Griffin actually was here about it a few weeks ago.

1708
02:16:23,358 --> 02:16:26,220
Is that possible?

1709
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:33,986
At one time, we had what's called architectural lighting on our property to light up the facade of the main building.

1710
02:16:34,326 --> 02:16:36,388
There was also a light on the slave quarters.

1711
02:16:37,298 --> 02:16:41,259
On the slave quarters, we provided other lighting, more like security lighting.

1712
02:16:42,079 --> 02:16:45,900
In fact, we have another problem with the lantern actually on George Street.

1713
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:50,860
Some of this conduit, et cetera, was installed many, many years ago.

1714
02:16:52,141 --> 02:17:05,903
Since that time, the lighting failed on the facade, but in this period, the whole practice for historic monuments, like National Historic Landmarks, which this is, which is the highest category of historic

1715
02:17:06,850 --> 02:17:11,693
protection in the United States have changed, the technology has changed.

1716
02:17:13,393 --> 02:17:22,418
At this point, we don't feel we can, two things, we're struggling with, struggling is too strong a word, we're debating about what to do, if anything, on that.

1717
02:17:22,658 --> 02:17:31,643
Of course, the building is set way back from the Main Street side, and so that you need a lot of lighting.

1718
02:17:32,943 --> 02:17:36,245
And, you know, the cost of that, the aesthetics,

1719
02:17:37,107 --> 02:17:37,827
There's some debate.

1720
02:17:38,828 --> 02:17:47,071
One of the co-presidents, Peter Gittleman of the Royal House Board, actually manages 36 buildings for historic New England.

1721
02:17:47,992 --> 02:17:56,495
They have the Otis House downtown, and they've had a lot of issues involving architectural lighting.

1722
02:17:56,575 --> 02:18:03,118
And I think that's become, it's an issue in the rather rarefied world of historic

1723
02:18:04,141 --> 02:18:04,641
properties.

1724
02:18:04,721 --> 02:18:07,523
We've made other improvements on the ground.

1725
02:18:07,583 --> 02:18:26,052
If you haven't been there for a while, the front entrance has been, we've added an accessible pathway, repaved a long section from the sidewalk up to the slave quarters entrance, and we've done other work on the grounds.

1726
02:18:27,953 --> 02:18:31,055
It's often said in the historic preservation business, at least

1727
02:18:31,461 --> 02:18:44,192
with 18th century buildings, these buildings are almost 300 years old at this point, that you might be better off digging a hole in the ground and shoveling $100 bills in terms of the costs of maintenance.

1728
02:18:44,492 --> 02:18:46,714
But rest assured, it's something that we're thinking about.

1729
02:18:46,754 --> 02:18:47,654
It's not my decision.

1730
02:18:47,694 --> 02:18:53,099
I'm merely the administrator in terms of further lighting there.

1731
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:57,903
Do you know if, has anybody taken a look at what that would cost?

1732
02:18:59,337 --> 02:19:01,398
We don't have a cost estimate.

1733
02:19:01,438 --> 02:19:03,079
We've been playing catch-up ball.

1734
02:19:03,119 --> 02:19:05,400
We redid the decorative fence last year.

1735
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:09,161
We need to work on the fence between the royal house and the park, as I mentioned.

1736
02:19:10,022 --> 02:19:13,503
We've replaced two restrooms.

1737
02:19:14,143 --> 02:19:17,565
We've done a lot of plumbing, a lot of electrical upgrade.

1738
02:19:17,725 --> 02:19:21,746
Construction in old buildings with these very high standards is very expensive.

1739
02:19:22,647 --> 02:19:23,547
So I don't have an estimate.

1740
02:19:24,608 --> 02:19:27,809
It would involve a new conduit.

1741
02:19:28,542 --> 02:19:39,588
And then the tricky part, as I understand it, and I'm no expert on the technology, is what kind of lights, how far away they are, what they get you in efficiency.

1742
02:19:40,048 --> 02:19:45,591
The lights we had there were the low sodium, which are incredibly inefficient.

1743
02:19:47,191 --> 02:19:52,874
And in fact, the bulbs are like $75 now, and they don't last long.

1744
02:19:53,134 --> 02:19:56,296
But the problem is that the conduit is shot, so there's not even any power.

1745
02:19:56,700 --> 02:19:57,940
So it's, it's on the list.

1746
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:06,543
We have, we have a fairly long list of, of interior and exterior, uh, maintenance and, and restoration, uh, items.

1747
02:20:06,843 --> 02:20:07,143
Okay.

1748
02:20:07,183 --> 02:20:07,443
Thank you.

1749
02:20:07,463 --> 02:20:08,143
Thank you for your hard work.

1750
02:20:08,283 --> 02:20:08,743
Appreciate it.

1751
02:20:09,084 --> 02:20:09,424
Thank you.

1752
02:20:11,924 --> 02:20:14,445
On the motion by council at night is seconded by council.

1753
02:20:14,465 --> 02:20:16,406
All those in favor.

1754
02:20:16,726 --> 02:20:24,708
I motion passes motion by the take hands and the clerk.

1755
02:20:32,622 --> 02:20:37,847
17 0 9 4.

1756
02:20:35,044 --> 02:20:37,847
Be it resolved offered by council by president Caravello.

1757
02:20:37,887 --> 02:20:43,311
Be it resolved that the code enforcement officer contact the representative of planet aid donation boxes.

1758
02:20:43,831 --> 02:20:49,256
Many of the sites where the boxes are located are overflowing with bags and falling onto the ground.

1759
02:20:50,637 --> 02:20:57,202
Uh, I have, I have gone by the box on mystic Avenue, uh, up in the heights at, at, uh, on Fulton street and the one at the,

1760
02:20:57,666 --> 02:20:59,387
book school and there's bags all over the place.

1761
02:20:59,407 --> 02:21:00,987
So they haven't been emptied for some time.

1762
02:21:01,607 --> 02:21:08,390
If the code enforcement officer could, uh, contact them to get them emptied because they are quite unsightly.

1763
02:21:11,451 --> 02:21:12,191
All those in favor.

1764
02:21:13,812 --> 02:21:14,532
Councilor Marks.

1765
02:21:17,073 --> 02:21:18,053
Thank you, Mr. President.

1766
02:21:18,193 --> 02:21:22,275
And maybe at some point we could send this issue to one of our subcommittees.

1767
02:21:22,827 --> 02:21:27,991
because it's a real large issue in this community regarding these metal boxes.

1768
02:21:29,032 --> 02:21:41,283
I've had the circumstance to go down to Fells Plaza on a number of occasions, and I've talked to the management company, and I've asked them about particular boxes because it may be a clothing box, but there's 22 TVs that are broken.

1769
02:21:41,632 --> 02:21:47,777
outside the clothing box, or it's a box just for books, and there's all old clothes out in front of the box.

1770
02:21:48,458 --> 02:21:53,222
And the management company said, we don't even know why the box is here.

1771
02:21:53,942 --> 02:21:59,307
So these companies are going around, and I'm not going to pinpoint any company, and they're throwing them on private lots.

1772
02:22:00,140 --> 02:22:01,661
that's just leaving them there.

1773
02:22:01,981 --> 02:22:06,222
So I think we need an ordinance, Mr. President, that addresses these boxes.

1774
02:22:06,502 --> 02:22:17,126
They should have a contact number on the side of the box, a person's name, a phone number, and there should be some type of permitting process if you want to put one of these large metal boxes on your property.

1775
02:22:17,506 --> 02:22:20,927
So I think we need to send that to a subcommittee, Mr. President.

1776
02:22:20,947 --> 02:22:21,427
You are correct.

1777
02:22:21,447 --> 02:22:22,648
I'm not sure which one, but.

1778
02:22:22,948 --> 02:22:25,989
I think that would go to the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances.

1779
02:22:26,009 --> 02:22:27,729
So if you would like to refer that there.

1780
02:22:27,789 --> 02:22:29,410
I'd like to refer that there, Mr. President.

1781
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:29,690
Thank you.

1782
02:22:30,190 --> 02:22:34,011
On the motion by, uh, counseling by President Caravello, all those in favor.

1783
02:22:34,991 --> 02:22:35,731
Motion passes.

1784
02:22:37,251 --> 02:22:49,894
Offered by President Caravello and Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its consolances and have a moment of silence to the family of Anna Consolino on her recent passing after a long illness.

1785
02:22:50,134 --> 02:22:54,295
Uh, if you're from West Medford, anyone, anyone who knows Anna Consolino,

1786
02:22:55,038 --> 02:23:01,946
She was a fixture in that square for many, many years, and she passed away last week after a lengthy illness.

1787
02:23:01,986 --> 02:23:02,647
Counselor Marks.

1788
02:23:03,448 --> 02:23:07,032
Mr. President, just if I could, I grew up with the family.

1789
02:23:07,768 --> 02:23:13,169
in West Meffitt, and the Consolino's name is synonymous with West Meffitt Square.

1790
02:23:14,149 --> 02:23:19,650
The ARCO service station was in business under Dick Consolino for 61 years.

1791
02:23:20,831 --> 02:23:23,391
And that service station was a landmark.

1792
02:23:23,751 --> 02:23:30,852
And every time I drive by and see a bank there, I just, I don't even recognize the area anymore, Mr. President.

1793
02:23:31,213 --> 02:23:33,673
But Anna Consolino will solely be missed.

1794
02:23:34,351 --> 02:23:43,697
And she was a terrific mother and grandmother and a loving wife and a tremendous business person for a lot of people in West Medford.

1795
02:23:43,917 --> 02:23:49,261
When you brought your car down there and you didn't have the funds to pay, Mr. President, the Consolinos would say, don't worry about it.

1796
02:23:49,521 --> 02:23:51,202
When you have the money, give it to us.

1797
02:23:51,642 --> 02:23:53,604
And that just doesn't happen in this day and age anymore.

1798
02:23:53,904 --> 02:23:58,547
I, being a longtime customer, my dad was a customer of the Consolinos and good people, good family.

1799
02:24:10,263 --> 02:24:19,027
Motion to revert back to regular business.

1800
02:24:19,047 --> 02:24:20,528
1-7-0-9-2.

Thank you.

1830
02:27:16,884 --> 02:27:18,805
Motion by council for approval.

1831
02:27:21,906 --> 02:27:34,572
Mr. President, if we could, I believe last year this council made a recommendation that the poll workers that are so diligent and do a great job in the city elections be fed because they're spending 13 hours

1832
02:27:35,658 --> 02:27:41,221
In some locations, because of the lack of personnel, it's tough for people to get out.

1833
02:27:41,722 --> 02:27:54,510
And I would ask, once again, if the city clerk would be so kind to make sure the poll workers get some type of bagged lunch or pizza or something, Mr. President, to show our appreciation for the effort that they put in.

1834
02:27:55,851 --> 02:27:56,171
Second.

1835
02:27:56,191 --> 02:27:57,371
Second by Councilor Dela Rosa.

1836
02:27:57,391 --> 02:27:58,292
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1837
02:27:58,712 --> 02:27:59,393
On the motion.

1838
02:28:00,113 --> 02:28:00,694
All those in favor?

1839
02:28:00,714 --> 02:28:00,814
Aye.

1840
02:28:01,674 --> 02:28:02,475
Motion passes.

1841
02:28:03,392 --> 02:28:11,775
Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Scott Pelley.

1842
02:28:11,795 --> 02:28:13,355
17-0-9-3 offered by President Caraviello.

1843
02:28:13,375 --> 02:28:29,200
It resolved that the Memphis City Council announced that the mayor will be commemorating the plaques at War Memorial Park and the city will be looking for any additional names to be added to the list there.

1844
02:28:29,240 --> 02:28:31,140
I'm glad that the mayor took this up pretty quickly.

1845
02:28:31,160 --> 02:28:32,821
It's something we asked her for a couple of weeks ago.

1846
02:28:33,689 --> 02:28:41,573
And if anyone knows of any names, uh, that need to be added, please inform the veteran services of the mayor's office as soon as possible.

1847
02:28:42,053 --> 02:28:53,179
So we can get these, uh, get the names on the plaque on the motion by, by, by councilor Del Rosso, all the councilor, councilor Scott Pelley, but I can't real quick.

1848
02:28:53,219 --> 02:28:55,920
Is there a timeline when we'd like to have that on?

1849
02:28:55,960 --> 02:29:00,142
I know that's been, um, I think, uh, our original paper said we were, we,

1850
02:29:00,648 --> 02:29:05,072
like to maybe get them done by maybe Memorial Day or at the least by Veterans Day.

1851
02:29:05,092 --> 02:29:09,776
So if we can get the name, I think there's about 10 ish names there at the moment.

1852
02:29:10,337 --> 02:29:13,400
So if anybody else knows of any names, please get them in.

1853
02:29:16,683 --> 02:29:17,403
All those in favor.

1854
02:29:18,544 --> 02:29:19,185
Council Marks.

1855
02:29:19,966 --> 02:29:21,267
Thank you, Mr. President.

1856
02:29:21,287 --> 02:29:25,531
You called on me and then you went to Scott Pelley, but that's all right.

1857
02:29:28,195 --> 02:29:33,378
He shines a little bit.

1858
02:29:33,418 --> 02:29:43,423
Mr. President, I think I'm not sure if it was you or one of the other councils offered a resolution to have many of the plaques on our veteran memorials to be refurbished.

1859
02:29:43,543 --> 02:29:43,763
Yes.

1860
02:29:43,943 --> 02:29:46,404
Have we got any response regarding the plaques?

1861
02:29:46,444 --> 02:29:47,065
We have not.

1862
02:29:48,365 --> 02:29:51,667
I've spoken to the Veterans Service Office, and I think that's a funding issue.

1863
02:29:52,007 --> 02:29:54,768
Some of the plaques are old and they're tin.

1864
02:29:56,733 --> 02:29:58,274
And I have talked to some people who do it.

1865
02:29:58,594 --> 02:30:04,577
They're unsure if they can even be redone again because of the age and the wear of them.

1866
02:30:05,617 --> 02:30:05,817
Right.

1867
02:30:05,837 --> 02:30:07,818
So if we can't refurbish them, we have to replace them.

1868
02:30:07,878 --> 02:30:12,321
I would hope that the mayor would appropriate some funds to get that done.

1869
02:30:13,301 --> 02:30:18,804
Well, I would ask that that be part of your paper also, Mr. President, that we get an update on the refurbishment of the plaques.

1870
02:30:18,824 --> 02:30:20,245
Mr. Clerk, if we could add that onto the paper.

1871
02:30:20,265 --> 02:30:25,127
If we could look at adding some additional funds to get some of the older plaques.

1872
02:30:25,631 --> 02:30:29,914
while the city cleaned and replaced.

1873
02:30:35,437 --> 02:30:41,702
All those in favor.

1874
02:30:41,722 --> 02:30:51,148
17 0 9 1 petition by Jean Martin, 10 coming street, Medford mess to address the council on not erasing Medford's history.

1875
02:30:51,728 --> 02:30:53,109
Name and address for the record, please.

1876
02:30:53,409 --> 02:30:54,570
Gene Martin, 10 coming street.

1877
02:30:55,148 --> 02:31:00,711
and I'm in a great mood tonight because I played pickleball, and I never played pickleball before, and it was a lot of fun.

1878
02:31:01,431 --> 02:31:05,914
All right, thank you.

1879
02:31:06,034 --> 02:31:08,275
I'm not trying to be adversarial, but educational.

1880
02:31:08,896 --> 02:31:18,601
After attending the mayor's State of the City address, I'm once again compelled by conscience to challenge Mayor Burke's political view, which this council signed off on, as it is

1881
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:22,782
inaccurate and harmful as it denies our legacy in reality.

1882
02:31:23,422 --> 02:31:35,509
Medford was discovered as a, discovered in quotes, as a result of the Sprague brothers finding the existing footpaths of the Indian inhabitants from Salem to Charlestown in 1629.

1883
02:31:36,550 --> 02:31:44,194
They crossed the Saugus Plains into Malden and then to the edge of the Middlesex Fells all the way to what would become Medford Square.

1884
02:31:44,814 --> 02:31:47,976
The square is a result of the continued use of this area

1885
02:31:48,665 --> 02:31:56,610
as it was the narrowest point in the river at low tide for crossing over, as originally used by the Indian population.

1886
02:31:57,530 --> 02:32:02,973
Just on the other side was another Indian footpath up to present day Winter Hill.

1887
02:32:03,213 --> 02:32:07,296
And from there, the Sprague brothers continued down to Charlestown.

1888
02:32:07,436 --> 02:32:18,382
In 1630, the governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony, Matthew Craddock, London merchant and dedicated Puritan, formed his own peculiar plantation

1889
02:32:19,912 --> 02:32:21,293
which became our city today.

1890
02:32:22,714 --> 02:32:29,878
It was seen as peculiar because unlike Cambridge, it was not set up as a town but a private plantation.

1891
02:32:30,699 --> 02:32:38,984
The original people whose land started to be taken away from them by these English intruders were known as the Pawtuckets.

1892
02:32:40,065 --> 02:32:42,046
That was the name of the native tribe, the Pawtuckets.

1893
02:32:42,947 --> 02:32:45,989
A man named Sagamore John was chief of the Pawtuckets.

1894
02:32:46,628 --> 02:32:49,949
Sagamore John and his people died of smallpox in 1633.

1895
02:32:51,370 --> 02:32:58,252
In 1644, the Indians remaining in Massachusetts put themselves under the English government.

1896
02:32:59,752 --> 02:33:04,134
Once there had been about 20,000 Indians within 50 miles of Plymouth alone.

1897
02:33:05,014 --> 02:33:07,435
By the close of the century, there were only about 4,000.

1898
02:33:09,375 --> 02:33:12,516
We know that by the 18th century, not all residents were free.

1899
02:33:13,757 --> 02:33:14,537
And that's in Medford.

1900
02:33:15,461 --> 02:33:22,044
Blacks, Indians, and forgive me for using the term mulattos, that is what is written in the history book that I got this from.

1901
02:33:22,364 --> 02:33:26,867
It's called Medford on the Mystic, and it was by Carl Seberg, who lived in West Medford on Madison Street.

1902
02:33:27,267 --> 02:33:28,748
I knew him because I took care of his aunt.

1903
02:33:29,648 --> 02:33:30,929
Amazing man.

1904
02:33:33,650 --> 02:33:33,890
Okay.

1905
02:33:34,611 --> 02:33:34,971
What was I?

1906
02:33:37,112 --> 02:33:37,312
Okay.

1907
02:33:37,652 --> 02:33:38,112
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1908
02:33:38,633 --> 02:33:38,993
Servants.

1909
02:33:39,233 --> 02:33:41,054
So these servants were held in slavery.

1910
02:33:41,514 --> 02:33:43,395
In a census of Negro slaves in

1911
02:33:44,026 --> 02:33:50,671
Massachusetts in 1755, there were 34 slaves over the age of 16 living in Medford.

1912
02:33:51,651 --> 02:33:53,793
27 were men and seven were women.

1913
02:33:54,614 --> 02:34:00,298
By 1764, the slave population in Medford had increased to 49.

1914
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:08,243
And in case you were wondering if Northern slavery was any better than Southern slavery, think again.

1915
02:34:08,844 --> 02:34:10,745
Medford selectmen, Medford selectmen,

1916
02:34:11,270 --> 02:34:29,716
In 1734, voted, quote, all Negro, Indian, and mulatto servants that are found abroad without leave and not on their master's business shall be taken up and whipped 10 stripes on their naked body by any freeholder of the town and be carried to that respective master's.

1917
02:34:30,156 --> 02:34:39,479
And said master's shall be obligated to pay the sum of 2S6D in money to said person that shall do so.

1918
02:34:40,304 --> 02:34:50,010
Slavery existed in Medford until 1787, when in the case of the Commonwealth versus Jennison, this institution was finally outlawed.

1919
02:34:50,911 --> 02:34:56,894
Our nation was not founded on the, quote, fundamental principle that all persons are entitled to equal protection under law, unquote.

1920
02:34:57,515 --> 02:35:06,260
The Declaration of Independence, paragraph two, when Thomas Jefferson wrote, quote, we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.

1921
02:35:07,312 --> 02:35:14,277
He currently owned 175 black slaves, including five of his own children, by Sally Hemings, who was herself his property.

1922
02:35:14,978 --> 02:35:22,604
Even at the time of his death, he only freed the slaves of his bloodline, and Hemings herself still remained in bondage to another relative.

1923
02:35:23,645 --> 02:35:28,889
The document's prime author, Jefferson, was clearly speaking only on behalf of a white class.

1924
02:35:29,770 --> 02:35:35,254
In one of the complaints Jefferson charged the King of England in the Declaration of Independence, paragraph 29, quote,

1925
02:35:37,028 --> 02:35:53,253
meaning the king, has excited insurrection amongst us and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguishable destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions.

1926
02:35:54,053 --> 02:36:02,136
Clearly, Jefferson was not including quote, Indian diversity, as a result of himself, as equal as to himself.

1927
02:36:02,916 --> 02:36:06,417
And furthermore, it could actually be argued that women as sexes,

1928
02:36:06,874 --> 02:36:12,939
were to be protected by the white man from the Indian, which, again, involves non-equality with the Native American.

1929
02:36:18,143 --> 02:36:35,577
The Constitution of the United States, Article I, Section 2, Paragraph 3 states, representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states, which may be included within the union according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number

1930
02:36:36,080 --> 02:36:43,102
of free persons, this is in the Constitution of the United States and this is in the Declaration of Independence, our founding documents.

1931
02:36:43,922 --> 02:36:45,862
Just wanted to let you know that.

1932
02:36:45,942 --> 02:36:57,305
The number of free persons included those bound to service for a term of years and excluding Indians not taxed, three-fifths of all persons.

1933
02:36:57,925 --> 02:37:02,586
In the Federalist Papers, Madison expressed the Southerner's own conflict between his self-interest

1934
02:37:03,088 --> 02:37:20,684
and having his slaves counted as persons for the purpose of the numbers of representatives in Congress, quote, one representative for every 30,000, unquote, due to the South's low rural white population comparative to the northern states and the incongruent concept that slaves were solely property.

1935
02:37:22,146 --> 02:37:24,308
The two concepts required mental gymnastics.

1936
02:37:24,883 --> 02:37:39,246
as they also used northern and southern women to argue in favor of using slaves in their census by suggesting that states already counted women who are also without suffrage in their census for the purpose of representation.

1937
02:37:40,126 --> 02:37:50,068
Northerners are just as guilty, for they had just as much self-interest in denying slaves as persons for the same reason, congressional representation.

1938
02:37:50,768 --> 02:37:53,829
Northerners, through Madison, stated, all this is admitted

1939
02:37:54,327 --> 02:38:05,589
It will perhaps be said, but does it follow from an admission of the numbers for the measure of representation or of slaves combined with free citizens as a ratio of taxation?

1940
02:38:06,329 --> 02:38:09,730
That slaves ought to be included in the numerical rule of representation.

1941
02:38:10,210 --> 02:38:14,090
Slaves are considered as property, not as persons.

1942
02:38:14,491 --> 02:38:15,691
This was the Northern argument.

1943
02:38:16,931 --> 02:38:22,652
They ought, therefore, to be comprehended in estimates of taxation, which are founded on property.

1944
02:38:23,146 --> 02:38:28,371
and to be excluded from the representation which is regulated by a census of persons.

1945
02:38:29,171 --> 02:38:40,060
Indians not taxed means that some Indians were taxed, which I infer to indicate that some Indians were still enslaved peoples at the time of this writing of the US Constitution.

1946
02:38:41,121 --> 02:38:49,909
In either case of our founding, does the white man view either the African slave or the Indian as persons entitled to the equal protection under law?

1947
02:38:52,575 --> 02:38:55,596
Article 1, Section 8, Paragraph 3.

1948
02:38:56,636 --> 02:39:00,998
To regulate commerce in foreign nations and among the several states and with the Indian tribes.

1949
02:39:01,978 --> 02:39:17,883
Explanation, Madison states that, quote, the regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is very properly unfettered from two limitations of the Articles of Confederation, which render the provision obscure and contradictory.

1950
02:39:18,783 --> 02:39:21,964
The power is their restraint to Indians, again,

1951
02:39:22,455 --> 02:39:36,519
The power is there restrained to Indians, not members of any of the states, and not to violate or infringe the legislative right, meaning US legislative right, not the Indians' rights, of any state within its own limits.

1952
02:39:37,299 --> 02:39:49,883
What description of Indians are to be deemed members of a state is not yet settled and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in the federal councils and how the trade with Indians

1953
02:39:51,618 --> 02:40:01,803
Though not members of a state, so the Indians were not considered members of the state, yet resided within its legislative jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external authority.

1954
02:40:02,664 --> 02:40:07,586
Without so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation is absolutely incomprehensible.

1955
02:40:08,347 --> 02:40:17,932
Article 1, section 9, paragraph 1, quote, the migration or importation of such persons as any of the states now existing shall think proper to admit

1956
02:40:18,500 --> 02:40:23,862
shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the year 1808.

1957
02:40:24,722 --> 02:40:30,984
But a tax or duty may be imposed on such importation not exceeding $10 for each person.

1958
02:40:32,124 --> 02:40:46,548
Madison's papers, in short, compromised with southern state leaders in order to grandfather out slavery by stopping its international trade starting in 1808, 20 years after the signing of the Constitution.

1959
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:50,080
Article 4, Section 2, Paragraph 2 and 3.

1960
02:40:51,861 --> 02:40:54,501
Councillor Knight.

1961
02:40:55,001 --> 02:40:57,182
Well, I do find this history lesson very entertaining.

1962
02:40:57,202 --> 02:41:02,483
I'm having trouble connecting its pertinence to the deliberations of the Memphis City Council at the current time.

1963
02:41:02,703 --> 02:41:03,323
I will get that.

1964
02:41:03,743 --> 02:41:04,043
Thank you.

1965
02:41:05,764 --> 02:41:12,445
This is evidence that the mayor's statement that you guys signed off on is inaccurate in its statement.

1966
02:41:12,745 --> 02:41:17,386
When you say that this country was founded on

1967
02:41:19,162 --> 02:41:20,183
equal protection under law.

1968
02:41:20,203 --> 02:41:27,290
It's absolutely not right, and it's inaccurate, and it's harmful, and I'm gonna argue that point in a minute too.

1969
02:41:29,011 --> 02:41:32,655
Okay, and entertaining, no, but it should be educational.

1970
02:41:33,856 --> 02:41:43,845
A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime who shall flee from justice and be found in another state shall, on demand of the executioner,

1971
02:41:44,910 --> 02:41:53,112
executive authority of the state from which he fled, be delivered up to be removed to the state having jurisdiction over the crime.

1972
02:41:55,073 --> 02:41:55,633
I'm almost done.

1973
02:41:55,693 --> 02:41:56,673
You're coming up on your 10 minutes.

1974
02:41:56,773 --> 02:41:56,933
Yep.

1975
02:41:57,533 --> 02:41:57,874
Thank you.

1976
02:41:59,654 --> 02:42:13,978
No person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered upon

1977
02:42:15,005 --> 02:42:21,670
claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due, which is used to justify the fugitive slave law.

1978
02:42:22,151 --> 02:42:23,192
Here I come into my argument.

1979
02:42:23,212 --> 02:42:23,792
Thank you very much.

1980
02:42:24,713 --> 02:42:33,400
In conclusion, your political worldview, and that includes you guys because you signed off on it, does a disservice to the city by erasing its history.

1981
02:42:33,760 --> 02:42:42,367
It ignores the brutal historic context that both Native Americans and African Americans have had to live under in our economic and political system throughout our history.

1982
02:42:42,883 --> 02:42:46,005
which denied their basic humanity and collective legitimate grievances.

1983
02:42:46,525 --> 02:42:59,432
This country still lives with the legacy of the racially motivated slaughter of Native Americans and human bondage of African Americans.

1984
02:42:59,972 --> 02:43:04,014
Again, respect for diversity is not an original concept of the founders.

1985
02:43:04,394 --> 02:43:10,958
It is my belief that you have adopted this concept of diversity because it is politically advantageous to all the new groups coming in.

1986
02:43:11,688 --> 02:43:14,110
to the city, including women, gays, people of color, races.

1987
02:43:16,191 --> 02:43:22,675
While I applaud your intent to include diversity, I cannot allow you to exclude the hard, cruel facts of our founding.

1988
02:43:23,315 --> 02:43:28,278
And I do recognize that some of other racial groups and religious groups have faced discrimination.

1989
02:43:28,338 --> 02:43:30,860
Nothing comes close to these two collective experiences.

1990
02:43:31,280 --> 02:43:41,106
Erasing history as it actually happened contributes to not only the pain and suffering of the two primary racial groups here described, but denies them reasonable mitigation

1991
02:43:41,608 --> 02:43:46,992
for the institutional legacy we are required by conscience to assist in resolving.

1992
02:43:47,372 --> 02:43:55,277
Therefore, the city needs to retract that diversity statement and rewrite it in a way that reflects their reality, not comforts yours.

1993
02:43:56,118 --> 02:43:59,059
And I would say in all, one more thing.

1994
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:02,001
When you point a finger at somebody, you're pointing three back at yourself.

1995
02:44:02,382 --> 02:44:04,323
But somebody else told me, a wise woman told me,

1996
02:44:04,763 --> 02:44:07,324
If you have a criticism, you should have three responses.

1997
02:44:07,704 --> 02:44:10,585
So I, I will help rewrite this.

1998
02:44:11,065 --> 02:44:11,705
That's what I'm saying.

1999
02:44:11,885 --> 02:44:16,427
Thank you very much.

2000
02:44:16,447 --> 02:44:16,747
Thank you.

2001
02:44:16,767 --> 02:44:19,548
Name and address for the record, please.

2002
02:44:19,968 --> 02:44:22,789
Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

2003
02:44:23,069 --> 02:44:28,830
I want to thank Jean Martin because she helps us not be doomed to repeat it.

2004
02:44:29,831 --> 02:44:33,572
Erasing Medford history is key and I thank her.

2005
02:44:34,348 --> 02:44:38,532
for bringing that information to the public here at the People's Forum.

2006
02:44:38,952 --> 02:44:50,562
The etch-a-sketch history of a city not documenting room 207 meetings is exactly bringing that point into the future.

2007
02:44:51,202 --> 02:44:54,465
This city council works very hard in those room 207 meetings.

2008
02:44:54,525 --> 02:45:02,912
Now, I took a video with my camera to preserve Medford history because this is history tonight, the last day of February.

2009
02:45:04,292 --> 02:45:06,173
2017, this is history.

2010
02:45:07,754 --> 02:45:23,983
We're doomed to repeat it if we don't document and study and analyze what goes on in room 2207, if we don't tape our athletic events, our cooking shows, Wright's Pond, fiction and nonfiction in Medford.

2011
02:45:24,463 --> 02:45:25,143
We don't have that.

2012
02:45:26,704 --> 02:45:27,905
And Gene's absolutely right.

2013
02:45:28,725 --> 02:45:32,147
When there's a state of the city address and the people here

2014
02:45:33,607 --> 02:45:37,868
didn't seem diverse, it seems like a polarized city, that should be documented.

2015
02:45:38,668 --> 02:45:40,389
It should be on public access TV.

2016
02:45:40,889 --> 02:45:43,809
And I appreciate the counselors that are respectful and listen to Ms.

2017
02:45:43,849 --> 02:45:48,650
Martin, because she worked hard on that paper, and I appreciate it, and I think she did a great job tonight.

2018
02:45:50,471 --> 02:45:56,092
But Room 207 is sometimes like an executive session at a board meeting, where people are excluded.

2019
02:45:57,192 --> 02:46:00,593
An open meeting law should include documenting important history.

2020
02:46:01,403 --> 02:46:07,306
And the citizens of Medford want to know what's going on with our fire department, with our police station.

2021
02:46:07,966 --> 02:46:10,767
As we found out tonight, this room was packed very good.

2022
02:46:13,288 --> 02:46:14,869
How do we preserve Medford history?

2023
02:46:16,129 --> 02:46:20,151
Those being paid $30,000 a year need to sit in their seats and listen to people.

2024
02:46:21,132 --> 02:46:24,553
One counselor was rustling papers, cleaning up a desk while Jean was talking.

2025
02:46:24,593 --> 02:46:27,575
That was very disrespectful because she pays his salary.

2026
02:46:29,042 --> 02:46:30,243
Clank clangs the doors.

2027
02:46:30,323 --> 02:46:31,544
Counselor Penta speaking.

2028
02:46:31,964 --> 02:46:34,185
One counselor shutting doors and getting water.

2029
02:46:34,405 --> 02:46:35,366
Very disrespectful.

2030
02:46:35,606 --> 02:46:47,074
We do not preserve our history by futzing around and being disrespectful and then demanding respect, demanding respect when you don't earn it, but you take out $30,000.

2031
02:46:47,294 --> 02:46:52,597
So Jean, it would be great when we get a TV station, let's take your essay.

2032
02:46:53,438 --> 02:46:55,319
Let's get the kids of the school.

2033
02:46:55,859 --> 02:46:56,900
Let's get the seniors.

2034
02:46:57,372 --> 02:47:00,673
to speak into the camera and preserve our history.

2035
02:47:01,194 --> 02:47:04,855
Those who don't preserve it are doomed to repeat if they don't know.

2036
02:47:05,715 --> 02:47:07,216
Thank you, City Council of Medford.

2037
02:47:08,677 --> 02:47:10,037
Have a good end of February.

2038
02:47:10,057 --> 02:47:10,437
Thank you.

2039
02:47:11,898 --> 02:47:18,140
Records of February 14th were passed to Councilor Dela Russo, who is not feeling well.

2040
02:47:18,220 --> 02:47:21,562
Councilor Dela Russo, are you feeling better this evening, and have you reviewed the records?

2041
02:47:27,325 --> 02:47:33,426
Mr. President, though my health has recovered, a discrepancy in the records has been pointed out to me.

2042
02:47:34,027 --> 02:47:43,429
Until a thorough investigation can be conducted into the whereabouts of a counselor on the evening in question, I shall not take these records off the table.

2043
02:47:43,449 --> 02:47:48,110
Thank you very much, and if you could bring that matter to the clerk for his attention, we would appreciate it.

2044
02:47:49,750 --> 02:47:53,751
The records of the meeting of February 21st, 2017 were passed to Counselor Falco

2045
02:47:56,838 --> 02:47:58,920
Councilor Falco, how did you find them?

2046
02:47:59,160 --> 02:48:00,001
Thank you, Mr. President.

2047
02:48:00,021 --> 02:48:03,224
I reviewed the records and found them to be in order and I move approval.

2048
02:48:03,524 --> 02:48:05,586
Motion for approval by Councilor Falco.

2049
02:48:06,207 --> 02:48:07,728
Second by Councilor Mox.

2050
02:48:07,948 --> 02:48:08,869
Mr. President.

2051
02:48:09,149 --> 02:48:09,950
All those in favor?

2052
02:48:10,310 --> 02:48:10,410
Aye.

2053
02:48:10,891 --> 02:48:10,991
Aye.

2054
02:48:11,772 --> 02:48:15,975
Motion to adjourn by Councilor- Happy Fat Tuesday.

2055
02:48:16,596 --> 02:48:19,399
Motion to adjourn by Vice President Mox.

2056
02:48:19,579 --> 02:48:19,839
Larry.
