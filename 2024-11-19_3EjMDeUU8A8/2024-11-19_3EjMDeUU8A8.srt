[SPEAKER_09]: I know the four cars in front sound good.

134
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,600
[SPEAKER_09]: It is mostly a commercial area.

135
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,944
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have other car dealerships up and down Mystic Ave.

136

00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:36,188

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Thank You mr. President

142
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:55,608
[SPEAKER_25]: I have a question.

143
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:58,089
[SPEAKER_25]: How many cars in total are gonna be there?

144
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:09,475
[SPEAKER_25]: for sale just for just walk and I my other concern was I know There's a lot of heavy equipment.

145
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:22,662
[SPEAKER_25]: I know it doesn't belong to you but yeah, there's you know, there's a big backhoe there and a bulldozer sir, I'm Concerned with people, you know, they're coming in with children the kids going over around that equipment.

146
00:16:22,762 --> 00:16:23,503
[SPEAKER_25]: Is there any way to

147
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:34,758
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe put a temporary fence there or a plastic fence so kids don't go over there when their parents are looking at a car.

148
00:16:36,911 --> 00:16:42,636
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk to the landlord and I can have him put something because it's that all that equipment belongs to him.

149
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:57,590
[SPEAKER_25]: I know there is a fence already, but I believe that there's an excavator and that's He had that big backhoe up there and there's a bunch of other stuff and I know some of the neighbors in the past have complained about that equipment being there but

150
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,652
[SPEAKER_25]: It's zoned properly and I guess you can keep it there.

151
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:03,133
[SPEAKER_25]: So but that's that was my concern about that.

152
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:14,080
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, just don't It's maybe like a plastic fence or something Take down really quickly That was my concern.

153
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,341
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do this.

154
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:20,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can put a fence problem plastic chain or anything you guys like

155
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,968
[SPEAKER_25]: But they have that orange fence that they sell.

156
00:17:26,008 --> 00:17:27,509
[SPEAKER_25]: You just roll it up and roll it back.

157
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,411
[SPEAKER_25]: That's just to keep the kids away from that.

158
00:17:31,031 --> 00:17:31,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

159
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:33,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

160
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:33,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

161
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:37,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

162
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,416
[SPEAKER_13]: What was that?

163
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:43,557
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

164
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:47,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I think he froze.

166
00:17:54,975 --> 00:18:00,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I certainly have no problem with this.

167
00:18:01,656 --> 00:18:06,338
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President.

168
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:15,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Adam, we're having some trouble hearing you.

169
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,941
[SPEAKER_06]: While Consul Knight is trying to resolve that issue, do any other consulates have questions regarding this?

170
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,281
[SPEAKER_13]: No?

171
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:26,123
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

172
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:26,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

173
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:28,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Narizio?

174
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:39,396
[SPEAKER_09]: These are one of the hiccups, Councilor Falco.

175
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:40,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we can hear you.

176
00:18:40,877 --> 00:18:41,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

177
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:46,340
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd just like to make a motion to add restrictions onto the permit.

178
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:48,842
[SPEAKER_16]: I certainly have no problem supporting it this evening.

179
00:18:48,882 --> 00:18:52,424
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the special permit should be attached to the business and not the business address.

180
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:57,708
[SPEAKER_16]: And also if we could place a 90 day review on it, Mr. President, I'd certainly have no problem supporting it this evening.

181
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

182
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,171

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

186
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:11,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank Councilor Knight for that.

187
00:19:11,154 --> 00:19:13,716
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that was something I was gonna add in, but I appreciate you jumping in.

188
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:20,741
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that I see everything else is in order, Mr. President, see we move forward favorably.

00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:44,599
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a request.

195
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:50,781
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not going to force him to put it, but for safety reasons, I would just have them keep that in mind.

196
00:19:54,864 --> 00:19:57,005
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting a thumbs up from Mr. McHugh.

[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I oppose making it illegal to build a second building on a lot because though right now we're in a COVID-19 emergency, as soon as this is over, we'll be back to our ordinary trifecta of emergencies of a housing shortage, traffic jams, and environmental emergencies.

279
00:26:07,337 --> 00:26:12,978
[SPEAKER_00]: And so given that situation, I think it's really inadvisable

280
00:26:13,418 --> 00:26:29,086
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to make it more difficult to build housing here in Medford near where people work and need to be and so forth, increasing commute times, forcing people away from areas where they could take the T into areas where they can't, et cetera, et cetera.

281
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:36,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am generally in support of building housing here, and I worry that this kind of thing would make it more difficult.

282
00:26:37,651 --> 00:26:37,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

283
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:39,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

284
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:39,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Appreciate it.

285
00:26:52,252 --> 00:27:00,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now we have... Hi, Alexander Lassenhop.

286
00:27:00,474 --> 00:27:01,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you guys can hear me?

287
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:03,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, if you could please add your name and address for the record.

288
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, Alexander Lassenhop, 28 Wright Avenue.

289
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:17,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have some concerns about the proposal, mostly because it seems like it could prevent the addition of needed housing either through new construction or the conversion of an existing structure on the lot.

290
00:27:18,739 --> 00:27:21,320
[SPEAKER_04]: If a lot is large enough for a second structure, I see no reason why

291
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:23,606
[SPEAKER_04]: the construction of one should not be allowed.

292
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:30,208
[SPEAKER_04]: And I worry that it could restrict Medford's ability to do something like allow accessory dwelling units in the future.

293
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:40,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are a really important tool for housing affordability and it can help seniors and family members age in place and provide additional density in neighborhoods without great visual impact.

294
00:27:41,313 --> 00:27:41,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I would

295
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:50,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand, as you read Andre's letter, that the CDB recommended not adopting this proposal and recommended a six-month moratorium in place.

296
00:27:51,064 --> 00:27:58,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I would strongly prefer that recommendation to the amendment as written, if you feel you must act on this issue one way or another.

297
00:27:58,265 --> 00:27:58,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

298
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:00,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

299
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:08,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ringbar.

300
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:10,047
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

301
00:28:11,412 --> 00:28:17,600
[SPEAKER_26]: Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street, and welcome everybody to my study.

302
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:27,351
[SPEAKER_26]: So I agree with the previous two speakers that this ordinance might prevent the creation

303
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:35,483
[SPEAKER_26]: through construction or conversion of affordable and environmentally friendly housing units.

304
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:51,846
[SPEAKER_26]: And if it's a response to the situation that came up at the end of the year on Forest Street, it seems to me a rather extreme response, kind of like gutting your kitchen because the faucet is leaking.

305
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:55,027
[SPEAKER_26]: So I would encourage

306
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:58,204
[SPEAKER_26]: rejecting that proposal.

307
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,325
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

308
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:00,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Ingber.

309
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:04,730
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

310
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:07,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Catalo, could we please have your name and address for the record?

311
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,641
[SPEAKER_24]: Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford.

312
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:15,681
[SPEAKER_24]: I would also urge you all to vote against that.

313
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:26,543
[SPEAKER_24]: Number one, I don't think we should be doing zoning piecemeal when we know that we have a lot of issues, but it does inflict a hardship in regards to affordable housing.

314
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:36,405
[SPEAKER_24]: So the more creative that we can get with housing in Medford, the more that we can develop housing that actually fits our neighborhoods and suits the people that lives here.

315
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:52,808
[SPEAKER_24]: There are some lots that are out there that you've all seen, I've already pointed out a few of them, that putting the second dwelling on that piece of land, that it fits, it works in the neighborhood, everyone's happy there.

316
00:29:53,229 --> 00:30:02,012
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't agree that every single lot should have two houses on it, but I do think that many of them actually could.

317
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:05,554
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a lot of property out there and I think it needs to be piece by piece.

318
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,061
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

319
00:30:08,522 --> 00:30:08,802
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

320
00:30:08,822 --> 00:30:21,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, anyone else in opposition?

321
00:30:23,393 --> 00:30:26,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Mr. Clerk, any emails?

322
00:30:33,681 --> 00:30:34,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk.

323
00:30:35,571 --> 00:30:37,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize, Mr. President, I was on mute.

324
00:30:37,913 --> 00:30:41,416
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't figure out how to end the mute.

325
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:43,578
[SPEAKER_14]: There are no emails with questions.

326
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:44,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

327
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:51,085
[SPEAKER_06]: So hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

328
00:30:52,346 --> 00:30:58,191
[SPEAKER_06]: If there are any councilors that would like to comment with regard to the response from the CD board.

329
00:30:58,651 --> 00:30:59,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

330
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:02,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

331
00:31:02,055 --> 00:31:15,522
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Mr. Husenhoff, was it, from Wright Avenue, had the right idea when he said that this is something that could be very restrictive for our ability to develop accessory dwelling uses and also build upon existing conversions.

332
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:21,165
[SPEAKER_18]: When Mr. Mulkey appeared before the council some time ago to discuss this, I raised this as an issue.

333
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:22,926
[SPEAKER_18]: I could certainly

334
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:29,529
[SPEAKER_18]: see the CD board's position, but at this point in time, Mr. President, I don't feel as though any action is warranted.

335
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,931
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's where I will stay on this issue.

336
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:33,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

337
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:36,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

338
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:31:37,994 --> 00:31:43,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate all the input from our constituents and Councilor Knight.

340
00:31:44,638 --> 00:31:45,078
[SPEAKER_09]: We had some

341
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:53,613
[SPEAKER_09]: We had some families reach out to us at the time that, as Mr. Engbert has mentioned, that this might be just a reaction to.

342
00:31:54,771 --> 00:32:19,251
[SPEAKER_09]: an issue on Forest Street and the reaction that I got back from some constituents are you have residents that are aging in place now and have might have the opportunity to possibly use that land to build and continue their family legacies and actually support our senior citizens to stay in our community and to To put this this limit into order.

343
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I think would drastically

344
00:32:22,213 --> 00:32:24,074
[SPEAKER_09]: affect our community in a negative way.

345
00:32:24,174 --> 00:32:27,315
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things we talked about, and I know that Ms.

346
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:43,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Catalo brought it up, is that we have some zoning issues that we're looking into, but at the same time, we're chasing away what makes Medford what's so great about it, and that's the ability for families to move into our community.

347
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:49,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've done so much acceptance for these one and two bedroom condominium complexes,

348
00:32:49,662 --> 00:33:02,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And now looking at the opportunity with the housing shortage, looking at affordable housing and having that opportunity to build on some lots, I think it would be a detriment to our community.

349
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:05,025
[SPEAKER_09]: So I agree with Councilor Knight.

350
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:13,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we're at a holding pattern right now, at least until we go through our zoning concerns and we really jump into this full force.

351
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's my two cents, Mr. President.

352
00:33:17,477 --> 00:33:18,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

353
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:20,859
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Councilor Caraviello and then Councilor Morell.

354
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

355
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:24,180
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

356
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,601
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree with my other colleagues in regards to this, Joe.

357
00:33:27,662 --> 00:33:37,226
[SPEAKER_25]: Everybody in Medford talks about affordable housing, affordable housing, and here we are having possible opportunities for affordable housing and we're shutting them down.

358
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,881
[SPEAKER_25]: So I said I cannot support this either.

359
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:51,608
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, we do have some zoning issues to address, but I think going down the line, if we feel that a change is needed, we can make it then.

360
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:55,651
[SPEAKER_25]: But currently right now, I cannot support this motion.

361
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:57,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

362
00:33:57,813 --> 00:33:58,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell.

363
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:00,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

364
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:03,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I also agree with my colleagues as far as this not being

365
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,496
[SPEAKER_05]: of the road we want to go down or the response.

366
00:34:06,617 --> 00:34:13,682
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think something is important with the city board recommendation is that for design standards that the building commissioner could draft up.

367
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:31,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, as I understand it, there is a little bit of a gray area with some of this stuff that if the building commissioner could draft some design standards, it would help him to act a little bit more in favor with the attended existing ordinances as far as enforcement and what goes on on lots right now.

368
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:36,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that's something we want to bring up at a later date, but I think it's just something we don't want to lose.

369
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:37,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I agree.

370
00:34:37,866 --> 00:34:46,211
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something we should go forward with in general, the zoning change in general, but I do think the design standards are something important we should look into.

371
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

372
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:49,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

373
00:34:50,744 --> 00:34:51,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

374
00:34:51,845 --> 00:34:57,590
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with council morale about design standards, and that's something that we should be exploring as a council.

375
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:10,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, when we do take a comprehensive look at our, uh, zoning ordinance, um, the six month moratorium that was stated, uh, in my opinion, uh, doesn't make any sense at this particular point.

376
00:35:11,461 --> 00:35:19,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, because I think if we were to put a moratorium in place, um, it would be for a very

377
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:23,665
[SPEAKER_15]: finite period of time, because we haven't looked at zoning.

378
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,147
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's the next logical step.

379
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:30,470
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wouldn't support at this time any type of moratorium either.

380
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:38,096
[SPEAKER_15]: I think this all came about and this is no secret that over the last year or two, there's been a number of projects in the city where

381
00:35:38,817 --> 00:35:42,060
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been some questionable lots in the community that have expanded.

382
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:53,151
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that raised eyebrows in the community and some people concerned about what was happening in the community and didn't want to see the face of method change.

383
00:35:54,112 --> 00:36:07,365
[SPEAKER_15]: But I agree with some logical standards regarding design review, a comprehensive approach to zoning that the council is going to be looking at hopefully very shortly, Mr. President, under your leadership.

384
00:36:08,326 --> 00:36:11,169
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we can move forward with a lot of these issues.

385
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,853
[SPEAKER_15]: And the last thing we want to do is curtail

386
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:23,757
[SPEAKER_15]: uh, building and especially building that adds, uh, additional affordable units, potential in-law apartments, which no one wants to talk about.

387
00:36:23,797 --> 00:36:26,940
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that's another issue that I hear over and over again.

388
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,345
[SPEAKER_15]: How come I can't have someone, my mother that lives out in Cambridge, come and live with me.

389
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:35,248
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to build a small in-law unit for her to live in.

390
00:36:35,668 --> 00:36:41,192
[SPEAKER_15]: that's not a rental, and believe it or not, many of those get denied by the zoning board.

391
00:36:41,612 --> 00:36:46,375
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are the issues I think we have to look at, but I cannot support this here tonight.

392
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:48,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

393
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:49,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears?

394
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,519
[SPEAKER_19]: I won't belabor the points.

395
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:03,827
[SPEAKER_19]: I think my colleagues have said most of what I wanted to say, but I think, you know, I agree that, you know, six months may not be the time frame right now, given everything that's going on, and so I would not support

396
00:37:04,582 --> 00:37:11,266
[SPEAKER_19]: the moratorium, and I certainly don't support the complete ban on something like this.

397
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:27,756
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just think this would prevent the development that we actually want to come here, which is small development and people developing, you know, their own homes and for, you know, their land for their family, or, you know, really small development for people who live here, not big development.

398
00:37:27,876 --> 00:37:29,317
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think we should reject it.

399
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:32,799
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

400
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:34,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight, did you have a question?

401
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:38,935
[SPEAKER_13]: No, sir, I did not.

402
00:37:39,476 --> 00:37:42,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

403
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:50,541
[SPEAKER_06]: Any Councilors have questions as far as this paper goes or how, any further questions on this?

404
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:53,802
Okay.

405
00:37:54,342 --> 00:37:55,243
[SPEAKER_13]: So make sure I get everybody.

406
00:37:55,363 --> 00:37:56,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

407
00:37:57,964 --> 00:38:00,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clark, do you have nothing on your end?

408
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:04,127
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no emails, Mr. President.

409
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:11,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So does someone want to make a recommendation as to what we should do with the CD recommendation?

410
00:38:11,365 --> 00:38:16,370
[SPEAKER_19]: So it would be a motion to accept the CD recommendation to reject the zoning amendment.

411
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:19,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clark, do you have that?

412
00:38:19,974 --> 00:38:22,978
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm working on it.

413
00:38:38,305 --> 00:38:44,348

00:44:38,377 --> 00:44:38,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Brody?

500
00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:41,020
[SPEAKER_19]: He's muted.

501
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,521
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to unmute him again.

502
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I can't see him.

503
00:44:44,303 --> 00:44:45,404
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize, yes.

504
00:44:46,462 --> 00:44:54,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I do see everything in order, Mr. President, and this does fall in a commercial area.

505
00:44:55,329 --> 00:45:12,462
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that with the recent closing of a neighboring gym in the same area, that the five o'clock hours are really what our constituents are looking for, the five to seven o'clock hours.

506
00:45:13,263 --> 00:45:23,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't, if I can, could Mr. Brody just give us a little more insight of what type of health and fitness location this will be?

507
00:45:24,026 --> 00:45:25,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it more of an individual?

508
00:45:25,507 --> 00:45:28,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this more of a, how is it going to be set up, Mr. Brody?

509
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:30,248
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, I'd be happy to.

510
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,969
[SPEAKER_21]: It's actually a small group fitness studio.

511
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,150
[SPEAKER_21]: It originated out of Australia.

512
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,711
[SPEAKER_21]: It's now in 40 countries.

513
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:40,571
[SPEAKER_21]: It is in the US.

514
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,872
[SPEAKER_21]: It started in the Los Angeles area.

515
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:45,082
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it's making its way here.

516
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,925
[SPEAKER_21]: They've recently opened one in Saugus in.

517
00:45:48,505 --> 00:45:50,887
[SPEAKER_21]: And Hadley, Massachusetts.

518
00:45:51,568 --> 00:45:57,913
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, it's really based off of, um, community and, uh, it's small group, as I mentioned.

519
00:45:57,973 --> 00:46:02,517
[SPEAKER_21]: So there may be 20 to 35 people at any one time.

520
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:11,464
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a functional workout based off of high intensity interval training, where you might do 45 seconds of an exercise.

521
00:46:11,962 --> 00:46:15,403
[SPEAKER_21]: rest for 15 seconds, and then move through various stations.

522
00:46:16,223 --> 00:46:22,365
[SPEAKER_21]: There's always two trainers there, and the whole idea is to give kind of personal training in a group setting.

523
00:46:24,026 --> 00:46:25,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all inside, correct?

524
00:46:25,646 --> 00:46:29,108
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nothing that we'll bring outside, any apparatus outside?

525
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:30,188
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

526
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:43,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, my biggest issue was looking at the traffic pattern impact and I see that the chief has followed up with no issues and the fire chief has followed up with no issues.

527
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,922
[SPEAKER_09]: So I yield to my colleagues if they have any comments.

528
00:46:47,442 --> 00:46:51,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, at this point I recognize, thank you Councilor Scarpelli, at this point I'll recognize Councilor Knight.

529
00:46:52,775 --> 00:46:56,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem supporting this measure this evening.

530
00:46:56,539 --> 00:47:05,747
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I would like to put restrictions upon the special permit, that the special permit goes with the business and not with the property address, and also that we conduct a 90-day review.

531
00:47:06,848 --> 00:47:09,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I offer those in the form of an amendment or restriction.

532
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Council.

533
00:47:11,352 --> 00:47:14,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the Council?

534
00:47:15,912 --> 00:47:28,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Move forward then Mr. President, I appreciate Councilor Knight for that follow-up and as he always does, make sure it's thorough and we're protecting that future business and people that will be residing there.

535
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:35,185
[SPEAKER_09]: So I move forward and accept and move this paper, this license forward with favorability.

536
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

537
00:47:37,907 --> 00:47:42,870
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Scott, Councilor Scarpelli seconded by Councilor-

538
00:47:44,535 --> 00:47:45,955
[SPEAKER_06]: seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

539
00:47:46,436 --> 00:47:49,856
[SPEAKER_06]: With the provisions, can you please read the provisions, Clerk Urbeas?

540
00:47:51,017 --> 00:47:59,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight's provision, his amendment restriction, is that the permit go with the business and not the address, and he's also asking for a 90-day review.

541
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,640
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, Clerk Urbeas, please call the roll.

611
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:11,461
[SPEAKER_20]: He's muted.

00:52:11,982 --> 00:52:12,562

614
00:52:13,962 --> 00:52:16,363
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm touching my nose, I'm sorry about that.

615
00:52:17,004 --> 00:52:18,524
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so you're not opposed?

616
00:52:19,184 --> 00:52:19,885
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not opposed.

617
00:52:20,005 --> 00:52:20,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Mitch knows.

618
00:52:21,245 --> 00:52:21,565
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

619
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:22,786
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Mitch knows, thank you.

620
00:52:22,866 --> 00:52:23,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck.

621
00:52:26,267 --> 00:52:28,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone opposed to the petition?

622
00:52:33,212 --> 00:52:37,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, have you received any e-mails from anyone that is opposed?

623
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:41,940
[SPEAKER_14]: No, there are no e-mails from anyone that is opposed.

624
00:52:42,541 --> 00:52:45,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

625
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:50,108
[SPEAKER_06]: I now call upon the chairperson of licensing, Councilor Scarpelli.

626
00:52:51,364 --> 00:52:58,668
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, Mr. President, before we discuss this item, can the clerk refresh my memory?

627
00:52:59,328 --> 00:53:09,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that we had this in front of us, but we're waiting on the permit to be approved, but we're waiting on one department to approve it.

628
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Am I mistaken?

629
00:53:11,413 --> 00:53:13,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a concern?

630
00:53:14,475 --> 00:53:16,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Council, I would need to do a little research on that.

631
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:32,371
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought that you had voted to approve the common victuals license, but that there was something else, but the petitioner needed to come back to amend for hours of operation.

632
00:53:32,391 --> 00:53:38,795
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thought the common vic license had already been approved and you were waiting, and the last piece was the extended hours.

633
00:53:39,335 --> 00:53:46,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Curnaby, I believe you are correct, but Councilor Knight would like to comment.

634
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:52,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Mr. President, I believe that they came for a common victorless license before they were open.

635
00:53:53,635 --> 00:53:57,318
[SPEAKER_18]: And because the Board of Health didn't sign off on it, we got some clarification.

636
00:53:57,358 --> 00:53:59,439
[SPEAKER_18]: And they came back with that clarification.

637
00:53:59,479 --> 00:54:02,261
[SPEAKER_18]: We voted to approve the common victorless license.

638
00:54:03,042 --> 00:54:08,746
[SPEAKER_18]: In the interim, I do believe the applicant had gone to the liquor commission to get a liquor license.

639
00:54:08,826 --> 00:54:11,328
[SPEAKER_18]: And now they're back here for extended hours, if I'm not mistaken.

640
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

641
00:54:14,482 --> 00:54:15,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

642
00:54:16,484 --> 00:54:21,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight, so I know that I just wanted to make sure that we're following the proper protocol with this.

643
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:31,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Sandoval, I know that this is probably one of the most anticipated establishments in Medford right now.

644
00:54:31,862 --> 00:54:32,442
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't wait to

645
00:54:33,023 --> 00:54:34,445
[SPEAKER_09]: to see this establishment open.

646
00:54:34,485 --> 00:54:44,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that I see everything is in order, but I yield to my colleagues for their comments.

647
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

648
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:52,383
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

649
00:54:52,443 --> 00:55:03,794
[SPEAKER_16]: In similar form to the previous Council before us, relative to special permits, I'd ask that the special permit be attached to the business, not to the property address, as a restriction.

650
00:55:04,835 --> 00:55:10,440
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do have some concern about a 2 a.m.

651
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,781
[SPEAKER_16]: license, Mr. President.

652
00:55:13,845 --> 00:55:15,546
[SPEAKER_18]: Most of our communities have 1 a.m.

653
00:55:15,606 --> 00:55:23,191
[SPEAKER_18]: licenses, and I'd hate to see Medford Square being the destination for last call between 1 o'clock in the morning and 2 o'clock in the morning.

654
00:55:24,271 --> 00:55:34,678
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that in the past we've addressed some of these applications through phasing in of extended hours, similar to what we did at Shanghai Moon.

655
00:55:35,018 --> 00:55:37,278
[SPEAKER_18]: and that's something that we may want to discuss.

656
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:44,740
[SPEAKER_18]: I do think that a restriction on hours or fading in of hours to 2 a.m.

657
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,641
[SPEAKER_18]: is something that deserves pertinent discussion at this point in time, Mr. President.

658
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:51,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

659
00:55:52,401 --> 00:55:54,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other councilors would you like to speak on this?

660
00:55:56,522 --> 00:55:57,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, I would.

661
00:55:58,323 --> 00:55:59,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Cavill.

662
00:55:59,763 --> 00:56:00,643
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice-President Cavill.

663
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:04,066
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree with Councilor Knight with the 2 a.m.

664
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:11,388
[SPEAKER_25]: License also I don't feel this appropriate for Medford Square Especially being a last stop and everybody else is closing.

665
00:56:11,908 --> 00:56:28,252
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'll support Councilor Knight's Amendment to this and I will I don't know if the if the petitioner wants to change it to 1 a.m Whichever which most of the other restaurants in method to have so but I will not support a 2 a.m.

666
00:56:28,312 --> 00:56:30,933
[SPEAKER_06]: License Thank You console caviar

667
00:56:32,802 --> 00:56:37,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, was that an amendment to change it to 1 a.m.

668
00:56:37,586 --> 00:56:38,567
[SPEAKER_06]: with a 90-day review?

669
00:56:39,587 --> 00:56:44,751
[SPEAKER_16]: The amendment that I made, Mr. President, was a restriction for restricting it to the property.

670
00:56:45,932 --> 00:56:47,453
[SPEAKER_18]: If we did a 1 a.m.

671
00:56:47,493 --> 00:56:50,395
[SPEAKER_18]: license with a 90-day review, I'd certainly be supportive of that this evening.

672
00:56:50,856 --> 00:56:51,436
[SPEAKER_18]: A 2 a.m.

673
00:56:51,476 --> 00:56:57,781
[SPEAKER_18]: license or a license later than that with no review is something I'd have a difficult time supporting this evening.

674
00:56:58,701 --> 00:56:59,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

675
00:57:00,065 --> 00:57:02,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, with any other cons consular marks.

676
00:57:02,846 --> 00:57:03,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

677
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:12,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to hear from Mr. Sandoval just to, uh, regarding his business and, uh, if he would have a problem with closing at one.

678
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:14,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Sandoval.

679
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:16,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't have any problems.

680
00:57:17,189 --> 00:57:19,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, at this point, um, it's fine.

681
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever you think, whatever you guys think is appropriate.

682
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:24,111
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do it that way.

683
00:57:24,651 --> 00:57:24,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

684
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:27,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'd be, you'd be okay with the one, the 1am closing.

685
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:29,812
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm okay.

686
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:32,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Marks.

687
00:57:33,179 --> 00:57:41,505
[SPEAKER_15]: So based on Mr. Sandoval, based on what Councilor Knight and Councilor Caraviello mentioned, I would too support the one o'clock closing.

688
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:44,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, Councilor Marks.

689
00:57:44,908 --> 00:57:45,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Sandoval.

690
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:49,471
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll now recognize Councilor Bears.

691
00:57:49,531 --> 00:57:50,532
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

692
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:56,256
[SPEAKER_19]: I think something open later is good for Medford in terms of 1 a.m.

693
00:57:56,356 --> 00:57:56,756
[SPEAKER_19]: or 2 a.m.

694
00:57:59,722 --> 00:58:03,964
[SPEAKER_19]: If the majority of the council supports 1 a.m., I think that's, I'm happy to vote for that.

695
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:16,329
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also just wanna say that I know this is a really hard time and I hope for you and all of our businesses in Medford the best and we'll make it through this.

696
00:58:16,389 --> 00:58:23,111
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also hope that in a few months we'll be able to come down and have a party together and support you after this is all over.

697
00:58:23,392 --> 00:58:23,992
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you.

698
00:58:24,492 --> 00:58:24,952

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Kluge.

811

[SPEAKER_15]: Will the street be closed off for any particular reason?

812
01:07:52,921 --> 01:07:55,181
[SPEAKER_15]: And how long, roughly, will this construction take?

813
01:07:56,862 --> 01:08:01,404
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it should not be closed off, because the work will be done just on the sidewalk.

814
01:08:01,464 --> 01:08:05,245
[SPEAKER_08]: The road itself will not be disturbed.

815
01:08:05,645 --> 01:08:08,406
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be just a sidewalk, and it'll be just one day, even half a day.

816
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:12,147
[SPEAKER_15]: And what type of sidewalk currently exists there?

817
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it asphalt or cement?

818
01:08:15,335 --> 01:08:17,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I, to be honest, I'm not sure.

819
01:08:18,198 --> 01:08:28,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the actual, the contractor, I think the, um, Rico, I think he is the actual going to repair it itself.

820
01:08:29,548 --> 01:08:31,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause we're not going to repair it because it's customer own.

821
01:08:32,431 --> 01:08:39,157
[SPEAKER_08]: So we, as a public utility, we have to petition the city.

822
01:08:40,578 --> 01:08:40,678
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

823
01:08:41,854 --> 01:08:45,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, and the pole itself is located on Middlesex Ave?

824
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:46,375
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

825
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:48,856
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, it's on the sidewalk.

826
01:08:49,336 --> 01:08:51,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and does that require state approval?

827
01:08:52,717 --> 01:09:00,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, there's nothing, the road will, the road, excuse me, the pole will not change secondary siphon service.

828
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:02,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

829
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:04,441

834
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:18,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a way of just confirming receipt of this?

835
01:09:18,701 --> 01:09:20,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I just know sometimes we have issues with notification.

836
01:09:22,624 --> 01:09:26,127
[SPEAKER_08]: We send all the, we donate any petition.

837
01:09:26,627 --> 01:09:36,475
[SPEAKER_08]: We send all the abutters to the city of town and they send a letter to the customers, whether it's gonna be a week or two weeks.

838
01:09:37,615 --> 01:09:39,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure, is it certified?

839
01:09:39,496 --> 01:09:42,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all right.

916
01:16:07,793 --> 01:16:08,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in favor?

917
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Cameron, if you could please have your name and address for the record.

918
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:23,071
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

919
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:24,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, City Council.

920
01:16:24,492 --> 01:16:30,613
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Dan Cameron with National Grid with offices at 170 Medford Street in Malden.

921
01:16:32,794 --> 01:16:33,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

922
01:16:34,494 --> 01:16:46,098
[SPEAKER_12]: As most of you probably are aware, Tufts University is constructing a building adjacent to their athletic center and in between there and the

923
01:16:47,618 --> 01:16:51,060
[SPEAKER_12]: the railroad tracks right on College Ave in the vicinity.

924
01:16:51,121 --> 01:16:54,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're using an address of 177 College Ave.

925
01:16:55,123 --> 01:16:58,066
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have a gas line that comes across the tracks.

926
01:16:59,066 --> 01:17:10,414
[SPEAKER_12]: And when it comes across the tracks for about the first, after it gets on to the College Ave side from Boston Ave, for about 160, 170 feet, it actually is on Tufts University property.

927
01:17:16,005 --> 01:17:18,367
[SPEAKER_12]: and then it cuts back into College Ave.

928
01:17:19,187 --> 01:17:29,155
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, with the design of this project that Tufts is constructing, they are gonna be doing quite a bit of work between the building and the sidewalk.

929
01:17:29,596 --> 01:17:37,682
[SPEAKER_12]: And they have asked us, and because of some grading changes, it's really necessary that we move this gas line entirely out into the street.

930
01:17:38,823 --> 01:17:42,345
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have a consultant that designed this forest.

931
01:17:42,946 --> 01:17:45,308
[SPEAKER_12]: We've submitted it and we've met with the

932
01:17:46,463 --> 01:17:51,305
[SPEAKER_12]: a city engineer and his staff a couple of times, and we've worked out all the details.

933
01:17:52,486 --> 01:18:02,050
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the other permit that we're going to need, which is reflected in the requirements, is a permit from the MWRA, and we're waiting to hear back from them.

934
01:18:02,831 --> 01:18:04,151
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the extent of the work.

935
01:18:04,712 --> 01:18:10,294
[SPEAKER_12]: This evening, I do have Ruthie Bennett with us tonight, and she can answer.

936
01:18:10,414 --> 01:18:12,595
[SPEAKER_12]: She's the project manager from Tush University.

937
01:18:13,096 --> 01:18:15,817
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there's any specific questions about the project and so forth,

938
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:19,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll bring her in to answer those questions.

939
01:18:19,935 --> 01:18:20,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

940
01:18:20,215 --> 01:18:21,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Cameron.

941
01:18:21,136 --> 01:18:21,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

942
01:18:23,577 --> 01:18:23,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

943
01:18:23,877 --> 01:18:25,498
[SPEAKER_06]: Cuddy, did you want to speak on this?

944
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:27,359
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

945
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:29,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

946
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else, anyone else like to speak that is in favor of the petition?

947
01:18:33,182 --> 01:18:42,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

948
01:18:43,341 --> 01:18:44,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, clerk Artemis.

949
01:18:44,342 --> 01:18:45,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone in favor?

950
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:46,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Any emails of anyone in favor?

951
01:18:51,846 --> 01:18:52,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, there are none.

952
01:18:52,747 --> 01:18:54,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

953
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

954
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:01,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in opposition of the petition?

955
01:19:01,892 --> 01:19:04,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone in opposition of the petition that would like to speak?

956
01:19:13,887 --> 01:19:16,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, any emails of anyone in opposition?

957
01:19:16,849 --> 01:19:17,909
[SPEAKER_14]: There are none, Mr. President.

958
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:19,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Hurtubise.

959
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:22,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

960
01:19:22,612 --> 01:19:27,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions from the councilors with regard to this project?

961
01:19:28,695 --> 01:19:29,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

962
01:19:30,576 --> 01:19:31,497
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

963
01:19:32,337 --> 01:19:34,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Roughly, how long will this project take?

964
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,522
[SPEAKER_12]: Council, we're estimating that it'll probably take anywhere from

965
01:19:42,371 --> 01:19:44,032
[SPEAKER_12]: a week to two weeks to complete.

966
01:19:45,713 --> 01:19:48,756
[SPEAKER_15]: And will the primary work be done during the day?

967
01:19:50,617 --> 01:19:51,297
[SPEAKER_12]: We're open.

968
01:19:52,919 --> 01:20:12,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of what we are going to do is, because the two projects, both the Green Line extension and the Tufts University project, as they move along, we're going to sit down after we get the, when we go through the road opening permit process with engineering, we're going to sit down with the police department.

969
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:17,044
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're open to if they would like us to work at night, we will.

970
01:20:18,285 --> 01:20:27,769
[SPEAKER_12]: If the MWRA permit comes through fairly soon, we all know this would be a good time to get this work done, especially with the university not in session right now.

971
01:20:27,829 --> 01:20:30,190
[SPEAKER_12]: But we're open to working at night if that's required.

972
01:20:32,851 --> 01:20:45,718
[SPEAKER_15]: As you may or may not know, Dan, there's been an issue with construction along the Green Line extension and trains that are going through at night at two, three in the morning have to sound their horn when they go through a construction area.

973
01:20:47,379 --> 01:20:49,941
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's been causing a lot of problems in the Salt Method area.

974
01:20:50,321 --> 01:20:58,285
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think this will have any impact, but I didn't know if the work that's being done there will affect the trains that are going through.

975
01:20:59,786 --> 01:21:01,287
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it won't.

976
01:21:02,283 --> 01:21:03,224
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that, in fact.

977
01:21:03,284 --> 01:21:06,005
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, there was no permitting that we had to get.

978
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:12,389
[SPEAKER_12]: We're working with everyone involved there, but there are no railroad permits that we had to obtain for this project.

979
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:13,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

980
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:16,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

981
01:21:18,252 --> 01:21:18,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Morell.

982
01:21:22,134 --> 01:21:22,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

983
01:21:23,074 --> 01:21:29,198
[SPEAKER_05]: So with the asphalt replacement, would that be curb-to-curb repaving in this instance, or would it be like patchwork?

984
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:35,214
[SPEAKER_05]: you may be opening up in a way that would only necessitate that, but just for clarity.

985
01:21:36,895 --> 01:21:49,705
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, when a road is less than five years old, we're required to do it from curb to curb, but we'll be working that out with Tufts because in fact, Ruthie Bennett, maybe I can bring her in to answer that question.

986
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:59,493
[SPEAKER_12]: They're doing a lot of work in front of that building and they may be, I know that the sidewalk in front of that building is going to be completely redone and it may be extending

987
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:05,099
[SPEAKER_12]: to have the whole road paved from crib to crib, I'm not sure.

988
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:07,559
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe we could ask her.

989
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:12,761
[SPEAKER_12]: But right now, we're working under the guidelines provided by the city engineer.

990
01:22:13,661 --> 01:22:13,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

991
01:22:14,722 --> 01:22:14,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

992
01:22:15,002 --> 01:22:15,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

993
01:22:15,062 --> 01:22:16,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Bennett, would you like to comment?

994
01:22:16,903 --> 01:22:19,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, hi, this is Ruthie Bennett with Tufts University.

995
01:22:20,444 --> 01:22:20,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?

996
01:22:21,525 --> 01:22:21,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

997
01:22:22,045 --> 01:22:22,845
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

998
01:22:23,265 --> 01:22:32,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So the part of the road that's going and the sidewalk that's going to be affected by the gas line relocation is part of the GLX right turn lane.

999
01:22:32,809 --> 01:22:38,291
[SPEAKER_03]: So that whole area of road will be redone long after this gas line relocation happens.

1000
01:22:38,471 --> 01:22:44,254
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's scheduled for the end of 2020, the whole road and sidewalk being redone.

1001
01:22:45,472 --> 01:22:46,652
[SPEAKER_03]: National Grid won't be doing it now.

1002
01:22:46,672 --> 01:22:49,993
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll happen with the GLX and the Tufts project much later in the year.

[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1115
01:27:33,762 --> 01:27:34,243
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President,

1116
01:27:35,462 --> 01:27:40,684
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm still getting calls from our residents as to the status of this project.

1117
01:27:40,744 --> 01:27:46,227
[SPEAKER_25]: And quite frankly, I don't have an updated status of this.

1118
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:49,748
[SPEAKER_25]: And I don't know how many houses are going there.

1119
01:27:49,768 --> 01:27:56,231
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think any of us really actually know what's going on there and what the status of this.

1120
01:28:00,436 --> 01:28:20,273
[SPEAKER_25]: make a motion that we have the either the the city engineer or the the Building Commissioner report back to us The status of this project in and the actual scope of the project because I it's changed multiple times And I say I I think there's a little bit of work going on there now but

1121
01:28:20,957 --> 01:28:23,278
[SPEAKER_25]: I only see two holes and there's two holes in the ground.

1122
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,078
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know what's happening up on the top.

1123
01:28:25,658 --> 01:28:29,419
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know the fire chief had some issues in the past with this.

1124
01:28:29,459 --> 01:28:33,660
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know if they've been resolved along with some drainage issues that are going on up there.

1125
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:46,843
[SPEAKER_25]: So at this point, if we can get a report from the city engineer and the building commissioner as far as the scope of the project and the status of the project and any other information that's pertinent to this.

1126
01:28:49,523 --> 01:28:50,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1127
01:28:51,105 --> 01:28:51,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell.

1128
01:28:52,386 --> 01:28:53,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1129
01:28:53,546 --> 01:29:00,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been in touch over the past few months with both the building commissioner and the acting city solicitor to try to get an update on this.

1130
01:29:00,752 --> 01:29:08,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And the most recent update I have from the city solicitor is the developer is actually in land court with a complaint against the city for this.

1131
01:29:08,577 --> 01:29:15,002
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's been continued to at least May, likely further out because of the COVID-19 public health crisis.

1132
01:29:16,755 --> 01:29:30,947
[SPEAKER_05]: not really a ton of answers, but I think this may be a reason it's kind of hard to get answers on this right now, is there's ongoing legal proceedings that will really only get probably slowed down at this point, just because of what we're dealing with these days.

1133
01:29:33,569 --> 01:29:34,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1134
01:29:35,591 --> 01:29:36,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the Councilors?

1135
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:38,013
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President?

1136
01:29:38,954 --> 01:29:39,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

1137
01:29:40,982 --> 01:29:50,349
[SPEAKER_25]: I've driven by there, and I see there is some work going on over the last couple of weeks with some digging over there.

1138
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:55,233
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, that's really all I've seen for some time.

1139
01:29:55,913 --> 01:30:09,843
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think we do—I think we ought to do a report on this just to see where it's going and the actual status of it, and if Councilor Morelle has said it's delinquent, what the status of it is over there also.

1140
01:30:10,595 --> 01:30:11,315
[SPEAKER_25]: from the solicitor.

1141
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:13,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1142
01:30:14,537 --> 01:30:16,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the councillors?

1143
01:30:26,224 --> 01:30:27,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1144
01:30:28,005 --> 01:30:30,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, any questions from email?

1145
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:33,407
[SPEAKER_14]: There are no questions on this topic in email.

1146
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:35,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Clerk Hurtubise.

1147
01:30:36,569 --> 01:30:37,790

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1232
01:34:22,513 --> 01:34:27,317
[SPEAKER_19]: what this resolution would do would be to ban face surveillance in Medford.

1233
01:34:27,397 --> 01:34:33,662
[SPEAKER_19]: However, similar to the last resolution, we filed this ordinance prior to the stay at home orders and the cancellation of our meeting.

1234
01:34:33,682 --> 01:34:35,303
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's why it's appearing on this agenda.

1235
01:34:36,724 --> 01:34:38,885
[SPEAKER_19]: There's many people who have expressed their support for it.

1236
01:34:39,366 --> 01:34:45,170
[SPEAKER_19]: But there's also a lot of people in city departments and employees who have a lot on their plate with the emergency response right now.

1237
01:34:45,210 --> 01:34:46,051
[SPEAKER_19]: And we don't want to

1238
01:34:46,662 --> 01:34:47,963
[SPEAKER_19]: have this discussion without them.

1239
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:58,268
[SPEAKER_19]: So I move that we would refer this item to the Public Safety Subcommittee for discussion with the police and other city departments after the COVID-19 emergency is lifted.

1240
01:34:59,289 --> 01:35:00,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1241
01:35:00,509 --> 01:35:02,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell, you are the co-sponsor.

1242
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:03,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to make any comments?

1243
01:35:04,832 --> 01:35:05,532
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just, yeah.

1244
01:35:06,092 --> 01:35:07,453
[SPEAKER_06]: I echo Councilor Bears.

1245
01:35:08,213 --> 01:35:08,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1246
01:35:08,974 --> 01:35:09,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1247
01:35:09,434 --> 01:35:14,597
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Bears to send this to the Public Safety Subcommittee,

1248
01:35:16,781 --> 01:35:28,867
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caraviello wanted to speak on it, and then Councilor- That was going to be my suggestion, Mr. President, to Senator Rubenstein during these times until the chief and everybody would have a better chance to actually discuss this.

1249
01:35:30,247 --> 01:35:32,328
[SPEAKER_25]: So I support that second.

1250
01:35:34,449 --> 01:35:34,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1251
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:45,295
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, if I may really quick, I did have the opportunity to talk to the chief of police earlier today, and he said he wanted to be part of this

1252
01:35:47,027 --> 01:35:48,467
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, part of this discussion.

1253
01:35:48,587 --> 01:36:00,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, uh, council beers when you bring it into, uh, if this goes to the, uh, subcommittee of public safety, um, you know, he would like to be part of that, but, um, he unfortunately couldn't be at the meeting tonight.

1254
01:36:00,571 --> 01:36:07,133
[SPEAKER_06]: It could not log into the meeting tonight as you can probably figure he's working, uh, some, uh, a lot of hours these days.

1255
01:36:07,173 --> 01:36:12,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Him and his, uh, um, you know, in every one of the method, public method, uh, police department in all of our, uh,

1256
01:36:13,595 --> 01:36:17,616
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say thank you to all of the public safety employees who are all working pretty much around the clock.

1257
01:36:17,816 --> 01:36:20,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to pass that on to you.

1258
01:36:21,357 --> 01:36:22,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilman Knight, you had a comment.

1259
01:36:23,037 --> 01:36:28,358
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may add really quick, I just got a message on my computer that said my Internet connection is unstable.

1260
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:33,739
[SPEAKER_06]: If I come out, Councilman Caraviello will move forward with everything if I get knocked out.

1261
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:35,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello, if you

1262
01:36:42,972 --> 01:36:47,736
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, yes, I'd just also like to ask that a representative from the district attorney's office be invited to the committee meeting.

1263
01:36:49,137 --> 01:36:50,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,102

01:39:35,443 --> 01:39:38,025
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's just been really good to see.

1300
01:39:39,347 --> 01:39:42,470
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the major issues we're facing is housing and housing stability.

1301
01:39:42,850 --> 01:39:46,614
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that people from every city department have been working on this.

1302
01:39:46,874 --> 01:39:50,657
[SPEAKER_19]: And I hope you know that we can support that work.

1303
01:39:51,999 --> 01:39:53,420
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, there's been a lot of moving pieces.

1304
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:56,363
[SPEAKER_19]: So I am going to propose significant amendments in a second.

1305
01:39:56,523 --> 01:39:57,444
[SPEAKER_19]: But before I do that,

1306
01:39:58,126 --> 01:40:09,455
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to remind everyone that regardless of what we do on this resolution or on the following resolution, which would be about city action, that tomorrow is April 1st.

1307
01:40:10,015 --> 01:40:20,783
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you're writing about this or you're watching or you're planning to talk about this with folks, if your rent's due on April 1st, your rent is due on April 1st tomorrow, no matter what we do tonight, we don't have the power to address that.

1308
01:40:21,344 --> 01:40:24,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Unless you have come to an arrangement with your landlord, that's where we are.

1309
01:40:25,727 --> 01:40:27,248
[SPEAKER_19]: But I also think that

1310
01:40:27,652 --> 01:40:31,054
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, I went to school for economics.

1311
01:40:31,074 --> 01:40:33,275
[SPEAKER_19]: I actually was an economist for the Department of Labor.

1312
01:40:33,795 --> 01:40:38,797
[SPEAKER_19]: And I just, looking at these, this is gonna be really bad.

1313
01:40:39,317 --> 01:40:41,178
[SPEAKER_19]: We have no idea what this is gonna look like.

1314
01:40:41,798 --> 01:40:46,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Having millions of people file for unemployment in one week is absolutely unprecedented.

1315
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:50,642
[SPEAKER_19]: And we truly don't know how long this emergency is going to last either.

1316
01:40:51,182 --> 01:40:54,224
[SPEAKER_19]: So what this resolution would do, and there are amendments in a second,

1317
01:40:55,266 --> 01:40:58,889
[SPEAKER_19]: ask for a coordinated statewide action on the housing crisis.

1318
01:40:59,549 --> 01:41:01,150
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what this resolution is about.

1319
01:41:02,752 --> 01:41:05,494
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a typo that includes the city of Medford in this resolution.

1320
01:41:05,514 --> 01:41:06,594
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not supposed to be there.

1321
01:41:06,635 --> 01:41:08,856
[SPEAKER_19]: This is just supposed to be about the state.

1322
01:41:09,757 --> 01:41:18,383
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm now going to send an email to the clerk and to my fellow Councilors with amended language.

1323
01:41:18,663 --> 01:41:24,588
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I will also read the amendment, Mr. President, if that seems like the right approach.

1324
01:41:25,665 --> 01:41:29,507
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so you want to amend the main resolution that you offered, correct?

1325
01:41:29,827 --> 01:41:30,688
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, correct.

1326
01:41:31,028 --> 01:41:32,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you please read the amendments?

1327
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:33,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1328
01:41:33,509 --> 01:41:37,972
[SPEAKER_19]: So the first amendment is in the second paragraph, striking the words and the city of Medford.

1329
01:41:41,313 --> 01:41:49,618
[SPEAKER_19]: So just requesting that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts use available authority and adding after the word foreclosures, including both residential and commercial properties.

1330
01:41:51,991 --> 01:41:53,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Then my amendment would add a third paragraph.

1331
01:41:54,792 --> 01:42:11,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ensure that any housing stability legislation protects nonprofit housing providers focused on lower income tenants from any loss of revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic or any legislation passed regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

1332
01:42:12,939 --> 01:42:14,280
[SPEAKER_19]: Adds a paragraph after that.

1333
01:42:15,013 --> 01:42:28,055
[SPEAKER_19]: be it further resolved that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts significantly increase the contribution to the COVID-19 rental assistance for families in transition, or RAFT, to reflect the scope of the economic crisis caused by COVID-19.

1334
01:42:28,835 --> 01:42:34,256
[SPEAKER_19]: This can be done using funds from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund and recent federal stimulus legislation.

1335
01:42:35,296 --> 01:42:36,237
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are the amendments.

1336
01:42:36,977 --> 01:42:40,177
[SPEAKER_19]: I have forwarded them to the councilors and to the clerk.

1337
01:42:41,197 --> 01:42:42,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1338
01:42:45,515 --> 01:42:48,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any councilors that would like to speak on this motion?

1339
01:42:48,296 --> 01:42:51,397
[SPEAKER_06]: And at this point in time, I'll recognize Councilor Knight, then Councilor Morell.

1340
01:42:52,438 --> 01:42:56,219
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, it would be nice to get a copy of House Docket Number 4935.

1341
01:42:56,260 --> 01:43:01,602
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be important for us before we take a vote to have an opportunity to read what the actual state legislation does say.

1342
01:43:02,282 --> 01:43:04,523
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't find a copy of that included in our package this week.

1343
01:43:05,407 --> 01:43:22,970
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, based upon the fact that we don't have a copy of that, and we've just amended the legislation, I'd ask that maybe we table this matter until a date certain so that we have an opportunity to review it and properly vet it, or in the alternative, refer it to the Housing or the Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee for further review, Mr. Perkins, and proper vetting.

1344
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:26,591
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making that in the form of a motion, Councilor?

1345
01:43:26,711 --> 01:43:27,031
[SPEAKER_06]: I am.

1346
01:43:27,051 --> 01:43:28,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1347
01:43:29,291 --> 01:43:34,532
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, do you want to forward this to the Wizard Housing?

1348
01:43:35,312 --> 01:43:38,675
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to get a copy of the House docket number 4935, number one.

1349
01:43:38,695 --> 01:43:45,601
[SPEAKER_18]: Number two, Mr. President, I'd like to refer it to either the Housing Subcommittee or the Committee on Intergovernmental Relations.

1350
01:43:46,422 --> 01:43:57,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Probably the best bet would be the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations based upon the fact that we're really focusing on state legislation, state law here, and less about what we can do in the city of Medford about amendments and the like.

1351
01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:00,193
[SPEAKER_18]: My suggestion, I'd offer that.

1352
01:44:04,222 --> 01:44:05,783
[SPEAKER_06]: on the motion of COTS all night.

1353
01:44:06,903 --> 01:44:07,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a second to that?

1354
01:44:08,844 --> 01:44:09,484
[SPEAKER_25]: Second, Mr. President.

1355
01:44:09,784 --> 01:44:10,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Second by Councilor Caraviello.

1356
01:44:11,825 --> 01:44:13,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Peers.

1357
01:44:15,966 --> 01:44:19,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I would be happy to, if necessary, table it to next week.

1358
01:44:20,208 --> 01:44:26,670
[SPEAKER_19]: What House Docket 4935 does is provide a statewide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures.

1359
01:44:27,730 --> 01:44:31,812
[SPEAKER_19]: I do not think we should refer this to a subcommittee as this is an emergency matter and it requires urgent action.

1360
01:44:33,532 --> 01:44:34,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Councilor Bears.

1361
01:44:34,873 --> 01:44:36,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor.

1362
01:44:36,053 --> 01:44:40,836
[SPEAKER_18]: The paper that's before us is asking actually the state legislature to take an urgent action.

1363
01:44:41,436 --> 01:44:43,057
[SPEAKER_18]: So the amount before us is an emergency.

1364
01:44:43,097 --> 01:44:45,878
[SPEAKER_18]: The amount before the state legislature is an emergency.

1365
01:44:45,898 --> 01:44:46,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Correct.

1366
01:44:46,318 --> 01:44:51,021
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we don't participate now, we will not have the ability to ask the legislature to take that action.

1367
01:44:52,602 --> 01:44:53,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor, you're cutting out.

1368
01:44:53,842 --> 01:44:54,463
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you please?

1369
01:45:05,564 --> 01:45:09,007
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't feel comfortable voting on something that I haven't had the opportunity.

1370
01:45:10,008 --> 01:45:13,272
[SPEAKER_06]: You're cutting in and out.

1371
01:45:13,292 --> 01:45:14,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you try starting again?

1372
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:17,816
[SPEAKER_27]: Better?

1373
01:45:17,836 --> 01:45:22,781
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a little bit better.

1374
01:45:28,706 --> 01:45:34,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, without a copy of the legislation here before us, I think it would be irresponsible of us to vote on it without properly vetting it.

1375
01:45:35,430 --> 01:45:37,591
[SPEAKER_06]: So would you be okay tabling for one week?

1376
01:45:39,111 --> 01:45:45,394
[SPEAKER_06]: If Council appears to get us the language, we can review it and take some action next week?

1377
01:45:45,415 --> 01:45:50,377
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion is the motion, Mr. President, referred to a subcommittee meeting into government or affairs alike.

1378
01:45:51,318 --> 01:45:55,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so that motion is offered by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1379
01:45:55,782 --> 01:45:58,124
[SPEAKER_06]: There were a couple of Councilors that wanted to speak further on this.

1380
01:45:58,444 --> 01:46:00,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell, I believe you're next.

1381
01:46:01,327 --> 01:46:02,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. President.

1382
01:46:02,628 --> 01:46:19,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to further amend the original paper just so that after the line about immediate moratorium on rent, mortgage payments, evictions, and foreclosures, I know Councilor Bears inserted residential commercial properties, and then just insert the phrase

1383
01:46:20,036 --> 01:46:28,779
[SPEAKER_05]: it makes sense, it's kind of a long sentence now, just those people, to clarify them, so those people impacted directly by the COVID-19 pandemic.

1384
01:46:28,819 --> 01:46:38,301
[SPEAKER_05]: So for reasons that it's not just like a blanket, so people impacted by that are those we would be focused on.

1385
01:46:38,321 --> 01:46:42,082
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you Councilor Morell.

1386
01:46:43,203 --> 01:46:43,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scacchioli.

1387
01:46:45,587 --> 01:47:08,154
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, can we amend this, if we can, to also add a piece that would, while this pandemic is ongoing and the fears of the unknown and people interacting in a negative way, I think putting a moratorium on all real estate and property owners are showing the properties.

1388
01:47:08,694 --> 01:47:10,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, Mr. President, I think that's important.

1389
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:14,911
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information.

1390
01:47:14,931 --> 01:47:21,254
[SPEAKER_19]: I do have that in the local resolution for Medford in 293.

1391
01:47:23,316 --> 01:47:24,716
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a different resolution.

1392
01:47:24,776 --> 01:47:25,997
[SPEAKER_06]: So I yield to that.

1393
01:47:26,097 --> 01:47:26,898
[SPEAKER_06]: So that resolution.

1394
01:47:26,958 --> 01:47:27,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1395
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:30,080
[SPEAKER_06]: So you would drive the, the amendment.

1396
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:31,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1397
01:47:32,081 --> 01:47:32,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Consular.

1398
01:47:32,741 --> 01:47:35,803
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe consular marks is next and then consular night.

1399
01:47:38,005 --> 01:47:39,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1400
01:47:39,846 --> 01:47:51,531
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw recently in one of the governor's speeches that he stated that the housing court, Massachusetts Housing Court, would not be considering any evictions or foreclosures.

1401
01:47:52,632 --> 01:48:00,795
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know the exact time frame that he gave, but he did say that they weren't going to entertain that subject at this particular point.

1402
01:48:01,236 --> 01:48:05,457
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that involves a large measure of what Councilor Bears is talking about.

1403
01:48:05,638 --> 01:48:06,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information.

1404
01:48:07,298 --> 01:48:22,722
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what he said was with the closing of the courts It's a 60 to 90 day process when the courts are open now that the courts are closed that that The clock doesn't start ticking till that happens.

1405
01:48:22,762 --> 01:48:24,983
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what I also read.

1406
01:48:25,303 --> 01:48:33,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you a point of information There have been some some measures taken they're not

1407
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:35,000
[SPEAKER_19]: They're not uniform.

1408
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:43,002
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, the point of the legislation is to clarify the various emergency executive orders and make it clear This is the policy everywhere in the state.

1409
01:48:43,302 --> 01:48:57,386
[SPEAKER_19]: Um because Basically the courts are closed so things can't move but that doesn't mean um that processes couldn't be initiated or There's some holes in the executive orders that the legislation is designed to clean up.

1410
01:48:57,746 --> 01:48:58,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Um so

1411
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:02,041
[SPEAKER_19]: That that's that's just the intent of the legislation.

1412
01:49:02,061 --> 01:49:05,924
[SPEAKER_19]: I've also just forwarded everyone a copy of the legislation Thank you.

1413
01:49:05,944 --> 01:49:11,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you council council appearance for doing that Council night, I believe you had additional comments

1414
01:49:18,103 --> 01:49:25,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Mr. President, just that this bill hasn't been only assigned a docket number at this point in time, and until it gets assigned to a committee and the like, we're not going to know who to send this to anyway.

1415
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:29,092
[SPEAKER_18]: If we want to send it to the committee chair to get it moving, we're going to send it to a committee chair to get moving.

1416
01:49:29,112 --> 01:49:31,094
[SPEAKER_18]: But what I see here, it's just a docket number.

1417
01:49:31,134 --> 01:49:32,715
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not even a bill that's been voted on yet.

1418
01:49:33,276 --> 01:49:41,262
[SPEAKER_18]: But with that being said, I do believe that the governor's office or the mayor's office had spoken about real estate showings as well.

1419
01:49:41,303 --> 01:49:44,245
[SPEAKER_18]: So I did want to talk about that a little bit in conflict with Scarpelli's point.

1420
01:49:44,848 --> 01:49:49,470
[SPEAKER_18]: But either way, Mr. President, the motion's on the table, it's been seconded, I move for the vote.

1421
01:49:49,531 --> 01:49:50,491
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1422
01:49:50,811 --> 01:50:09,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, that the resolution with the amendments of Councilor Bears, Councilor Morell, Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by... Did someone second this to be moved?

1423
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:11,362
[SPEAKER_25]: I did, I already did, Mr. President.

1424
01:50:11,382 --> 01:50:13,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Vice President Cavillo, that this go to the

1425
01:50:15,156 --> 01:50:17,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Was the Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee?

1426
01:50:17,678 --> 01:50:17,899
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1427
01:50:18,559 --> 01:50:18,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1428
01:50:18,859 --> 01:50:19,620
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion.

1429
01:50:21,142 --> 01:50:22,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, did you receive any emails?

1430
01:50:23,064 --> 01:50:23,364
[SPEAKER_14]: I did.

1431
01:50:23,404 --> 01:50:24,065
[SPEAKER_14]: I received two.

1432
01:50:24,565 --> 01:50:24,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1433
01:50:24,805 --> 01:50:25,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you please read the emails?

1434
01:50:26,127 --> 01:50:26,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1435
01:50:27,977 --> 01:50:29,678
[SPEAKER_14]: The first one is from Marie Izzo.

1436
01:50:30,378 --> 01:50:32,159
[SPEAKER_14]: She says, my name is Marie Izzo.

1437
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:35,201
[SPEAKER_14]: I live at 29 Pilgrim Road, Medford, Massachusetts.

1438
01:50:35,861 --> 01:50:38,403
[SPEAKER_14]: I support the eviction and foreclosure moratorium.

1439
01:50:39,243 --> 01:50:45,226
[SPEAKER_14]: This pandemic has created an urgent need that requires immediate local action on tenant protections as well as landlord protections.

1440
01:50:46,087 --> 01:50:49,188
[SPEAKER_14]: The longer businesses are shut down and shelter in place orders are in effect.

1441
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:51,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Our only choice is to help our unemployed residents.

1442
01:50:52,050 --> 01:50:54,491
[SPEAKER_14]: Homelessness is simply not an option at this time.

1443
01:50:54,651 --> 01:50:55,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Marie Izzo.

1444
01:50:57,424 --> 01:51:02,928
[SPEAKER_14]: The second one is from Jennifer Sullivan from 63 Marston Street.

1445
01:51:03,749 --> 01:51:13,516
[SPEAKER_14]: She says, hello, I would like to register my support of a moratorium on rent, mortgage payment, and eviction and foreclosures for indefinite amount of time until the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

1446
01:51:13,696 --> 01:51:14,677
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Jennifer Sullivan.

1447
01:51:17,539 --> 01:51:18,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, clerk Herbies.

1448
01:51:20,361 --> 01:51:22,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone else that would like to comment on this?

1449
01:51:29,112 --> 01:51:29,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1450
01:51:30,353 --> 01:51:31,334
[SPEAKER_13]: I see a hand up.

1451
01:51:31,494 --> 01:51:31,834
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1452
01:51:31,854 --> 01:51:32,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you already.

1453
01:51:32,395 --> 01:51:33,035
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

1454
01:51:33,055 --> 01:51:39,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Matt, could you please give us your name and address for the record?

1455
01:51:39,881 --> 01:51:40,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.

1456
01:51:40,722 --> 01:51:42,563
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matt Hughes.

1457
01:51:42,844 --> 01:51:45,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 76 Boston Ave in Medford.

1458
01:51:46,707 --> 01:51:47,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Hughes.

1459
01:51:49,160 --> 01:51:52,462
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, and happy Trans Day of Visibility also for everyone.

1460
01:51:53,723 --> 01:52:13,135
[SPEAKER_01]: As a non-binary person, I also want to let folks know about the ways in which this may be the need to pay rent in this time when many, many people have been cut off from their sources of income, including many people in the queer community.

1461
01:52:14,937 --> 01:52:34,602
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an unprecedented time, and proceeding forward with eviction proceedings in this context would be incredibly detrimental to many, many people in my personal life, many people who I live with directly, and

1462
01:52:36,970 --> 01:52:42,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see people like myself recovering from this.

1463
01:52:43,432 --> 01:52:46,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, I urge you to take urgent action on this.

1464
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:50,074
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have time to put this through subcommittee.

1465
01:52:50,714 --> 01:52:53,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcommittees meet very, very rarely.

1466
01:52:55,275 --> 01:52:57,956
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need everyone to take action on this now.

1467
01:52:59,297 --> 01:53:09,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards Councilor Knight's point that this hasn't been assigned the docket number, I also understand the degree to which things move very slowly in the state house.

1468
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:24,810
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree that that's something to remember in this context, but I also want everyone to keep in mind how unprecedented this context is and how much we really need to stand up for everyone around us.

1469
01:53:25,671 --> 01:53:25,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1470
01:53:26,512 --> 01:53:27,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1471
01:53:31,395 --> 01:53:31,515
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

1472
01:53:31,575 --> 01:53:33,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Catalo, name and address to the record, please.

1473
01:53:34,377 --> 01:53:37,899
[SPEAKER_24]: Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1474
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:39,940
[SPEAKER_24]: First of all, I will state I am a tenant.

1475
01:53:40,361 --> 01:53:48,146
[SPEAKER_24]: However, I am going to ask you not to put any stricter, put anything out there that the governor hasn't already done.

1476
01:53:48,166 --> 01:53:54,610
[SPEAKER_24]: I think Governor Baker has been very responsive to the people of Massachusetts, and I think for each city to go about

1477
01:53:55,093 --> 01:53:59,014
[SPEAKER_24]: making different rules, we're going to have a bigger problem.

1478
01:53:59,094 --> 01:54:06,176
[SPEAKER_24]: In regards to telling people that they don't have to pay rent, not every mortgage is underwritten by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

1479
01:54:06,556 --> 01:54:10,697
[SPEAKER_24]: And right now, those are the only people that can call and get a stay on their mortgage.

1480
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:16,219
[SPEAKER_24]: And what's happening is people are being told at the end of those three months that they have to pay the whole thing in full.

1481
01:54:16,659 --> 01:54:19,380
[SPEAKER_24]: So if people don't pay their rent, the mortgages can't get paid.

1482
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:24,061
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that the stimulus package in itself is going to be aid to everybody.

1483
01:54:25,542 --> 01:54:29,563
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'd really rather you didn't do any stricter restrictions than what the governor has already done.

1484
01:54:29,983 --> 01:54:39,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Today, he turned around and actually made real estate, residential, and commercial services as deemed essentials, which does give me the right to go open up my office again.

1485
01:54:39,707 --> 01:54:42,388
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to do it because I don't feel like we need to.

1486
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:43,448
[SPEAKER_24]: We can work remotely.

1487
01:54:43,468 --> 01:54:46,509
[SPEAKER_24]: And we are working with precautions

1488
01:54:47,149 --> 01:54:50,410
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't think that we need any stricter guidelines than that either.

1489
01:54:50,430 --> 01:54:52,771
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1490
01:54:53,471 --> 01:54:55,932
[SPEAKER_19]: Point of information, Mr. President, I just, and thank you, Kelly.

1491
01:54:56,212 --> 01:55:00,373
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to be really clear that this resolution, the city would not be adding any restrictions.

1492
01:55:01,093 --> 01:55:03,954
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a resolution asking the state house to take action.

1493
01:55:04,634 --> 01:55:07,795
[SPEAKER_19]: So this would not create a separate rule here in Medford around these issues.

1494
01:55:08,656 --> 01:55:11,917
[SPEAKER_19]: It would ask the state legislature to create a statewide policy.

1495
01:55:11,977 --> 01:55:13,497
[SPEAKER_19]: So the state house and state Senate.

1496
01:55:13,517 --> 01:55:16,398
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just want to be very clear that even if this passes,

1497
01:55:16,951 --> 01:55:18,133
[SPEAKER_19]: We do not have different rules here.

1498
01:55:18,213 --> 01:55:20,597
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to pay your rent tomorrow if it's due tomorrow.

1499
01:55:20,717 --> 01:55:26,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I just I really want to avoid any lack of clarity on that just because it could be a problem.

1500
01:55:26,205 --> 01:55:30,992
[SPEAKER_19]: As you say, Kelly, we need to make sure that until until there are changes that are statewide and clear.

1501
01:55:32,490 --> 01:55:35,653
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want people thinking they have something that they don't have.

1502
01:55:36,333 --> 01:55:39,656
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, I just want to add that the resolution includes mortgages as well.

1503
01:55:39,756 --> 01:55:45,320
[SPEAKER_19]: So statewide around both mortgages and rent, the intention is to help everybody.

1504
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:46,981
[SPEAKER_19]: I think everybody's struggling right now.

1505
01:55:47,142 --> 01:55:52,366
[SPEAKER_19]: And as you just said, the federal guidelines are only protecting the FHA loans and not all of the people who don't have those.

1506
01:55:52,446 --> 01:55:53,767
[SPEAKER_19]: So I hear you.

1507
01:55:54,267 --> 01:55:55,228
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what this is about.

1508
01:55:55,308 --> 01:56:01,353
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's definitely not about Medford doing anything on its own separate from the rules around

1509
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,661
[SPEAKER_19]: the statewide rules around rent and mortgage.

1510
01:56:05,081 --> 01:56:06,661
[SPEAKER_19]: That's not what this resolution would do.

1511
01:56:06,681 --> 01:56:10,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1512
01:56:12,323 --> 01:56:13,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1513
01:56:13,183 --> 01:56:15,164
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Jess Farrell.

1514
01:56:15,564 --> 01:56:17,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1515
01:56:23,526 --> 01:56:24,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, hey, sorry.

1516
01:56:24,426 --> 01:56:25,887
[SPEAKER_22]: I unmuted myself.

1517
01:56:26,187 --> 01:56:26,947
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm Jess Farrell.

1518
01:56:27,287 --> 01:56:30,188
[SPEAKER_22]: My address is 29 Martin Street and Medford.

1519
01:56:30,764 --> 01:56:38,089
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and I support the the legislation that's in the state house right now, and I think that we should, uh, support it as well as a city.

1520
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:44,154
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it helps for municipalities to, uh, sign on and support of this type of legislation.

1521
01:56:44,174 --> 01:56:57,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, and I think, uh, you know, I just don't think that the federal government is going to do what we really are going to need on a more local level in Massachusetts and then even at the municipal level too.

1522
01:56:57,704 --> 01:56:59,145
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think it's really important that we.

1523
01:57:00,404 --> 01:57:03,186
[SPEAKER_22]: the measures in place that are in this bill.

1524
01:57:03,506 --> 01:57:11,894
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would really appreciate the council voting to support this today and not send it to committee.

1525
01:57:12,014 --> 01:57:17,459
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree with others who have stated that this is an emergency issue and that we don't have time to send it to committee.

1526
01:57:17,639 --> 01:57:17,899
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1527
01:57:27,493 --> 01:57:28,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, please.

1528
01:57:29,234 --> 01:57:29,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi there.

1529
01:57:30,215 --> 01:57:34,117
[SPEAKER_00]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1530
01:57:34,917 --> 01:57:46,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say that everybody who rents an apartment in Medford is paying a lot of rent for the purpose of having such a great location that provides access to everything that's great around Boston.

1531
01:57:46,944 --> 01:57:48,085
[SPEAKER_00]: the T, etc.

1532
01:57:48,386 --> 01:57:49,407
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things are closed.

1533
01:57:49,447 --> 01:57:56,395
[SPEAKER_00]: We're told not to ride the T. Perhaps we paid a lot of money in rent in order to avoid a commute to work and that's not happening, etc.

1534
01:57:56,755 --> 01:58:00,579
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's impacted by this in terms of what they're getting for their rent.

1535
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:06,946
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, people don't have the option of

1536
01:58:08,848 --> 01:58:15,712
[SPEAKER_00]: signing up to live someplace here in Medford without signing on to a 12-month contract to access a place to live.

1537
01:58:15,932 --> 01:58:20,155
[SPEAKER_00]: They're locked into that high contract rent no matter what happens in the real world.

1538
01:58:20,655 --> 01:58:22,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's basically no choice but to do that.

1539
01:58:23,036 --> 01:58:24,977
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really get month to month or something.

1540
01:58:24,997 --> 01:58:26,238
[SPEAKER_00]: So

1541
01:58:29,832 --> 01:58:36,656
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that needs to be considered, that basically you don't get to know in advance what the world's going to look like.

1542
01:58:37,336 --> 01:58:39,618
[SPEAKER_00]: The landlord chose to buy a slice of earth.

1543
01:58:40,298 --> 01:58:45,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the earth goes to hell in a handbasket, maybe that's the risk they're taking as a landlord.

1544
01:58:45,901 --> 01:58:46,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

1545
01:58:47,883 --> 01:58:48,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1546
01:58:54,286 --> 01:58:55,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex Lussenhoff.

1547
01:58:59,820 --> 01:59:08,827
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to support what Jess Farrell and Matt Hughes said before and just impress upon the council the emergency nature of this legislation.

1548
01:59:08,847 --> 01:59:18,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand it's not asking Medford in particular to enact any particular ordinance, but the more the state house hears from communities around the state, the better.

1549
01:59:18,954 --> 01:59:24,538
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be hearing from all of our communities that this is a true emergency and that any

1550
01:59:25,310 --> 01:59:35,392
[SPEAKER_04]: any action that is within the state's authority should be taken to protect both renters and homeowners in this time.

1551
01:59:35,952 --> 01:59:36,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1552
01:59:37,992 --> 01:59:38,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1553
01:59:44,373 --> 01:59:45,314
[SPEAKER_20]: John Costas.

1554
01:59:46,074 --> 01:59:49,694
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, John Costas, 56 Haynes Street, Medford.

1555
01:59:51,235 --> 01:59:52,655
[SPEAKER_20]: This time I'm not scratching my nose.

1556
01:59:54,599 --> 02:00:01,884
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I'd like to just, I think what Kelly was talking about, that there's a lot of good landlords and a lot of bad landlords.

1557
02:00:02,904 --> 02:00:09,608
[SPEAKER_20]: My concern is on the better landlords that will let their tenants slide because they understand the situation.

1558
02:00:10,949 --> 02:00:18,213
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there any way, I don't know how it could work, that the city can give the landlords a break on their taxes, on their property tax?

1559
02:00:19,351 --> 02:00:39,747
[SPEAKER_20]: either move their taxes down, so they don't have to pay it immediately until the rents are made up, or maybe just decrease the amount of tax under the circumstances, and give the landlords, because I'm afraid the landlords are going to get a bum rap here, because they have expenses, and as it was already said, they have mortgages, and they get property tax to pay.

1560
02:00:40,468 --> 02:00:44,471
[SPEAKER_20]: And if they're not getting the money rents in, well, they're not going to pay their expenses either.

1561
02:00:44,531 --> 02:00:51,415
[SPEAKER_20]: So if there's a way of helping them out by a property tax, maybe that will be some assistance.

1562
02:00:52,256 --> 02:00:53,577
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, father, thank you.

1563
02:00:54,438 --> 02:00:54,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1564
02:00:55,458 --> 02:00:57,139
[SPEAKER_19]: Quick point of information, Mr. President.

1565
02:00:57,279 --> 02:00:59,201
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I don't disagree with you at all, John.

1566
02:00:59,221 --> 02:01:06,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, Mr. President, I had a point of information.

1567
02:01:06,886 --> 02:01:07,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1568
02:01:07,086 --> 02:01:07,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

1569
02:01:07,687 --> 02:01:07,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1570
02:01:07,947 --> 02:01:08,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

1571
02:01:10,462 --> 02:01:12,643
[SPEAKER_19]: just John, I don't disagree with you at all.

1572
02:01:12,763 --> 02:01:17,806
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think can we talk about that when we talk about 20-293, which is about what the city can do.

1573
02:01:17,946 --> 02:01:21,047
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't want to conflate those two things because I think it's really important.

1574
02:01:21,087 --> 02:01:25,169
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, nothing in this that we're putting up right now is on the city.

1575
02:01:25,329 --> 02:01:27,190
[SPEAKER_19]: It's about us asking the state to take action.

1576
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:30,652
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I think when that paper comes up, I don't disagree with you at all, John.

1577
02:01:31,545 --> 02:01:41,117
[SPEAKER_19]: I just don't want to, I don't want anyone watching or anyone writing or anyone who talks about this to, to confuse the two and give people an understanding that's incorrect about what the city has done tonight.

1578
02:01:41,938 --> 02:01:42,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, agreed.

1579
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:43,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1580
02:01:44,321 --> 02:01:44,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1581
02:01:44,901 --> 02:01:45,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, John.

1582
02:01:46,003 --> 02:01:46,303
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you.

1583
02:01:53,449 --> 02:01:55,552
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Council bass are bringing this point forward.

1584
02:01:56,654 --> 02:02:07,349
[SPEAKER_09]: He's, you know, I think the best interest looking out for all our constituents, but I do tend to side with constant night with this and maybe not.

1585
02:02:09,432 --> 02:02:10,373
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, a subcommittee.

1586
02:02:10,393 --> 02:02:13,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there are so many questions as we're hearing right now.

1587
02:02:13,777 --> 02:02:20,464
[SPEAKER_09]: There are people for it, people against it, but there are still some questions, Adam, that I think that have to be addressed.

1588
02:02:20,504 --> 02:02:26,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that, you know, as I'm sitting here and getting texts from landlords and homeowners saying,

1589
02:02:26,720 --> 02:02:30,966
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, George, I own a home, so I still have expenses.

1590
02:02:30,986 --> 02:02:43,582
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know we're not doing anything right now, and we're telling people to pay taxes now, but you're asking us as a council to forward an opinion to the state that we would support something that some of our constituents

1591
02:02:44,343 --> 02:03:02,212
[SPEAKER_09]: have just sent messages saying that they're very frightened and they're, you know, they're now in a level of stress that, you know, that I can understand that Matt and Alex and other people who just put forward that we understand that, you know, so I, you know, so I

1592
02:03:03,192 --> 02:03:20,725
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe not a subcommittee meeting or maybe calling for a subcommittee meeting where it's even before this next Tuesday's meeting so we can move forward with this so there's a better understanding with both the legislation that we're sending you having us read and the

1593
02:03:21,546 --> 02:03:25,770
[SPEAKER_09]: the impact that we can calm people down to say, you know, this is what we're looking for.

1594
02:03:25,790 --> 02:03:38,862
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that your intention by saying you're still paying your rent tomorrow, but we're still asking this committee, this council to support something that is now putting our homeowners that do have a mortgage in fear.

1595
02:03:39,283 --> 02:03:42,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that, you know, there's enough questions here, everyone, that

1596
02:03:43,126 --> 02:03:45,627
[SPEAKER_09]: that we shouldn't jump on a vote right now.

1597
02:03:46,287 --> 02:03:47,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I do agree with that.

1598
02:03:47,248 --> 02:03:51,089
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I don't agree with, you know, holding it off to a subcommittee.

1599
02:03:51,129 --> 02:03:59,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think that maybe years past our subcommittees have been like this, but we're working pretty quick when we call for subcommittees when we have issues like this.

1600
02:03:59,592 --> 02:04:00,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is time sensitive.

1601
02:04:00,892 --> 02:04:01,473
[SPEAKER_09]: We can see that.

1602
02:04:01,513 --> 02:04:01,753
[SPEAKER_09]: This is

1603
02:04:03,274 --> 02:04:07,877
[SPEAKER_09]: We've never been in this pandemic before, this issue.

1604
02:04:07,917 --> 02:04:15,462
[SPEAKER_09]: So I agree with all of us that we need to move forward with this at haste, but at the same time, there's still some questions that we need to vet out before I will vote on this.

1605
02:04:15,502 --> 02:04:17,363
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to share that.

1606
02:04:17,383 --> 02:04:19,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1607
02:04:19,785 --> 02:04:21,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

1608
02:04:22,427 --> 02:04:23,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Bears.

1609
02:04:24,589 --> 02:04:27,351
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to add, again, this would be mortgage payments as well.

1610
02:04:27,451 --> 02:04:29,552
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is to try to help homeowners as well.

1611
02:04:29,993 --> 02:04:32,294
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're watching, this is to try to help all of us.

1612
02:04:32,754 --> 02:04:35,436
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone in every situation is facing a housing crisis.

1613
02:04:35,836 --> 02:04:38,718
[SPEAKER_19]: Should have had my parents come on and talk about their mortgage.

1614
02:04:40,279 --> 02:04:42,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1615
02:04:43,141 --> 02:04:43,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1616
02:04:43,601 --> 02:04:45,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Ingber.

1617
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:58,641
[SPEAKER_26]: I was just going to make the point that Councilor Bears made, which is that this is not a threat to landlords.

1618
02:04:58,721 --> 02:05:02,242
[SPEAKER_26]: This protects landlords, homeowners, and tenants.

1619
02:05:02,842 --> 02:05:09,464
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a piece of statewide legislation to prevent both evictions and foreclosures.

1620
02:05:11,184 --> 02:05:15,525
[SPEAKER_26]: So it's really to help everybody and to stabilize people in their housing.

1621
02:05:16,581 --> 02:05:17,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1622
02:05:17,822 --> 02:05:18,602
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information.

1623
02:05:19,283 --> 02:05:21,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1624
02:05:21,804 --> 02:05:23,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, that's what I'm saying.

1625
02:05:23,305 --> 02:05:27,908
[SPEAKER_09]: This is such a fluid issue that people are concerned both ways.

1626
02:05:27,968 --> 02:05:37,534
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is something that, you know, that we vote on it right now because it's that, it's, you know, tonight, you know, there are constituents that want to hear this through.

1627
02:05:37,674 --> 02:05:43,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and they want to be part of that subcommittee or that next meeting that we can move forward on.

1628
02:05:43,958 --> 02:05:45,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1629
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:50,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Marks.

1630
02:05:51,656 --> 02:05:52,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1631
02:05:53,598 --> 02:05:55,760
[SPEAKER_15]: I think time is of the essence with this issue.

1632
02:05:56,521 --> 02:06:05,711
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would highly recommend that we use our bully pulpit as this meeting to alert residents to call their state delegation.

1633
02:06:06,568 --> 02:06:19,359
[SPEAKER_15]: To be quite honest with you, I think it's important that when a rep receives, I used to work for a state rep, when you receive 800 phone calls rather than a letter from the Medford City Council, that goes a long way.

1634
02:06:19,699 --> 02:06:29,107
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would urge anyone that's tuning in right now, anyone that's watching, if you haven't picked up the phone, if you haven't sent your state rep an email, let them know where you stand on the issue.

1635
02:06:29,607 --> 02:06:33,868
[SPEAKER_15]: That's, you know, because time is of the essence and it's important that we move forward.

1636
02:06:34,469 --> 02:06:44,692
[SPEAKER_15]: And I agree with my colleagues, you know, I think this is an important issue, but I also think it has to be properly vetted before we give it a stamp of approval, Mr. President.

1637
02:06:45,472 --> 02:06:47,793
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I have some issues with, you know,

1638
02:06:49,208 --> 02:07:09,893
[SPEAKER_15]: If Councilor Bears came out and said house docket four nine three five like we do on many other things that City Council supports that You know that may be a different issue, but they came out with other items that I'm in that particular docket I assume the amendments that council beers offered with things that weren't part of that house docket and

1639
02:07:10,362 --> 02:07:15,223
[SPEAKER_15]: So that adds a whole other layer of complexity on something that's already a complex issue.

1640
02:07:15,904 --> 02:07:19,064
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it takes it too far to be quite honest with you.

1641
02:07:19,805 --> 02:07:26,146
[SPEAKER_15]: I probably would support just voting for House Dock at 4935, saying that we approve that.

1642
02:07:26,486 --> 02:07:28,547
[SPEAKER_15]: But now you add all these other amendments into it.

1643
02:07:28,947 --> 02:07:30,027
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a whole other issue.

1644
02:07:30,047 --> 02:07:31,348
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that merits discussion.

1645
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1646
02:07:34,128 --> 02:07:36,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears, did you have a comment on that?

1647
02:07:36,838 --> 02:07:38,660
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, just um, I hear you on that.

1648
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:45,187
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, the way that the process has been working is this legislation is out there and then Also speaker de leo and president spilk.

1649
02:07:45,207 --> 02:07:56,439
[SPEAKER_19]: I've said we're going to do something Um, it may or may not just be the legislation Uh, so that's why there's other elements included in there to try to influence the full scope of debate and discussion That's going on around the issue.

1650
02:07:56,459 --> 02:07:59,262
[SPEAKER_19]: I would be happy to strike everything except

1651
02:07:59,805 --> 02:08:13,629
[SPEAKER_19]: the supporting H4935 and for tabling that portion or amending it to remove that and refiling that for another meeting so that we can at least get on the record supporting H4935, which I think is very important.

1652
02:08:20,691 --> 02:08:21,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that a motion, Mr. President?

1653
02:08:21,771 --> 02:08:23,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be amendable to that, Mr. President.

1654
02:08:24,869 --> 02:08:27,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's already a motion on the floor.

1655
02:08:27,031 --> 02:08:31,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So Consul and I would have to pull back his motion if he wants to, but.

1656
02:08:31,995 --> 02:08:35,518
[SPEAKER_18]: I made a motion to refer the paper to a subcommittee, Mr. President.

1657
02:08:35,538 --> 02:08:46,006
[SPEAKER_18]: He's made a motion to further amend the paper for a fifth time, striking all the amendments that he's already made and just bringing it right down to the first sentence of his agenda from the first sentence of the resolution, from what I understand.

1658
02:08:47,827 --> 02:08:48,388
[SPEAKER_19]: I would do that.

1659
02:08:49,425 --> 02:08:52,166
[SPEAKER_19]: Did you do it, or was that a motion, or was that just?

1660
02:08:52,346 --> 02:08:56,327
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't make that motion until, since your motion's already on the floor, but I would make that motion.

1661
02:08:57,047 --> 02:08:58,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Why not?

1662
02:08:59,008 --> 02:09:00,168
[SPEAKER_15]: You can make multiple motions.

1663
02:09:01,168 --> 02:09:02,629
[SPEAKER_19]: Then I move to amend to that effect.

1664
02:09:03,409 --> 02:09:05,830
[SPEAKER_19]: So you'd be stretching the second, third paragraph in all amendments?

1665
02:09:06,570 --> 02:09:06,790
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1666
02:09:07,330 --> 02:09:08,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd support that right now.

1667
02:09:09,571 --> 02:09:13,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Councilor Bears, I just want to make sure we're all clear on this.

1668
02:09:13,372 --> 02:09:18,153
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears, what would be your motion, your updated motion, I guess?

1669
02:09:19,475 --> 02:09:34,622
[SPEAKER_19]: move to amend the language to remove paragraph two and three and to remove all of my amendments made prior to this, and also to remove Councilor Morell's amendment because it's no longer, that text is no longer.

1670
02:09:34,802 --> 02:09:35,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1671
02:09:35,182 --> 02:09:42,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Newton.

1672
02:09:42,285 --> 02:09:48,648
[SPEAKER_18]: I certainly have no problem with the gentleman striking the language and moving

1673
02:09:50,221 --> 02:09:53,243
[SPEAKER_18]: I would have a problem with him removing the amendment that was made by a fellow councilor.

1674
02:09:53,764 --> 02:09:58,207
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm sure that you would like an opportunity to discuss that opportunity right now.

1675
02:09:58,587 --> 02:09:59,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Morell.

1676
02:10:00,649 --> 02:10:07,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm fine with that amendment because the amendment is to sentences that would no longer exist as it is amended by Councilor Baer.

1677
02:10:07,875 --> 02:10:09,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is fine by me.

1678
02:10:10,517 --> 02:10:10,977
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1679
02:10:11,257 --> 02:10:16,401
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now, the matter that's before the council would be be a resolve the Medford City Council expressive support file stock and I'm before the 4935.

1680
02:10:18,937 --> 02:10:23,080
[SPEAKER_18]: an act for providing a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures during the COVID-19 emergency?

1681
02:10:24,161 --> 02:10:24,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1682
02:10:25,963 --> 02:10:26,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd support that.

1683
02:10:27,104 --> 02:10:39,674
[SPEAKER_17]: And then do we want, be it further resolved, the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislation Delegation, as well as to the chairs and vice chairs of the Joint Committee on Housing, speaking to Leo and Senate President Spelker?

1684
02:10:39,914 --> 02:10:41,115
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think we can include that.

1685
02:10:41,475 --> 02:10:44,678
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also happy removing it if the clerk would take action to the same effect.

1686
02:10:47,196 --> 02:10:52,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm amenable to the resolution regardless, as long as it's passed.

1687
02:10:53,239 --> 02:11:03,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I'm amenable to the amendments that have been made to the resolution and I would withdraw my motion to refer the paper to Intergovernmental Affairs and replace that motion with a motion for approval.

1688
02:11:05,123 --> 02:11:14,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so Councilor Knight has pulled back his resolution.

1689
02:11:17,307 --> 02:11:21,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears has amended the main resolution.

1690
02:11:21,628 --> 02:11:23,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I correct?

1691
02:11:23,789 --> 02:11:25,389
[SPEAKER_06]: And Clerk Herbies, you have all that?

1692
02:11:26,309 --> 02:11:30,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the resolution has been amended to include basically the first paragraph.

1693
02:11:31,410 --> 02:11:40,512
[SPEAKER_14]: And rather than including the last paragraph, there's just a request that I send the resolution to the people named in the last paragraph, which I will do anyway.

1694
02:11:41,032 --> 02:11:42,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, perfect.

1695
02:11:42,633 --> 02:11:44,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Councilor Bears,

1696
02:11:46,177 --> 02:11:47,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

1697
02:11:48,237 --> 02:11:48,717
[SPEAKER_28]: As amended.

1698
02:11:49,258 --> 02:11:49,778
[SPEAKER_06]: As amended.

1699
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:51,898
[SPEAKER_28]: By Councilor Bears.

1700
02:11:52,218 --> 02:11:52,998
[SPEAKER_06]: By Councilor Bears.

1701
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:55,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1702
02:11:57,519 --> 02:11:58,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1703
02:11:59,139 --> 02:11:59,439
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1704
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:01,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Caraviello.

1705
02:12:02,220 --> 02:12:02,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1706
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:03,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1707
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:04,380
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1708
02:12:05,121 --> 02:12:05,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1709
02:12:06,681 --> 02:12:06,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1710
02:12:07,701 --> 02:12:08,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1711
02:12:08,941 --> 02:12:09,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1712
02:12:10,241 --> 02:12:11,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1713
02:12:11,302 --> 02:12:11,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1714
02:12:12,222 --> 02:12:12,922
[SPEAKER_14]: President Falco.

1715
02:12:14,068 --> 02:12:16,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1716
02:12:16,669 --> 02:12:20,831
[SPEAKER_06]: 2-0-291 offered by Councilor Knight.

1717
02:12:21,491 --> 02:12:29,015
[SPEAKER_18]: We have resolved that the Board of Health examine the use of- The sponsor of the resolution withdraws the bill that's been addressed by Governor Baker's executive order.

1718
02:12:29,535 --> 02:12:29,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1719
02:12:31,896 --> 02:12:32,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1720
02:12:32,817 --> 02:12:33,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight has withdrawn 2-0-291.

1721
02:12:42,225 --> 02:12:44,665
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-292, offered by Councilor Knight.

1722
02:12:44,906 --> 02:12:59,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the city administration contract with a professional industrial sanitation expert to disinfect all public buildings in order to protect essential employees from topical exposure to the coronavirus.

1723
02:13:00,468 --> 02:13:01,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1724
02:13:02,408 --> 02:13:03,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1725
02:13:04,429 --> 02:13:11,290
[SPEAKER_18]: As we're all aware, many of our public employees still come to work to provide the essential and core services that are necessary in our community.

1726
02:13:11,937 --> 02:13:18,980
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, however, um, there are employees in city hall, for example, or in our school departments, for example, that are reporting to every worker into these buildings.

1727
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:21,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, but these buildings have not yet been professionally sanitized.

1728
02:13:22,481 --> 02:13:30,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I do know that there are professional sanitizing teams that have been out in the community, um, that have done our fire stations, our police stations and our police cruisers.

1729
02:13:31,024 --> 02:13:38,847
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and I'm hoping that we can extend this program to include our other public buildings where employees are currently stationed, even on skeleton cruiser during public employee, uh, public.

1730
02:13:39,353 --> 02:13:45,675
[SPEAKER_18]: lockdowns where they're reporting to work and there are topical services that have seen exposure before this lockdown has taken place.

1731
02:13:45,695 --> 02:13:54,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I think it's important that we take every step that's possibly feasible for us to protect the workers here in our community that are providing and delivering these essential services.

1732
02:13:54,698 --> 02:14:07,482
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in asking that all public buildings where employees are currently working be professionally sanitized so the employees working there can receive peace of mind and also the highest degree of safety possible during this time.

1733
02:14:08,585 --> 02:14:09,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

1734
02:14:09,846 --> 02:14:12,088
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to recognize Councilor Scarpelli in a minute.

1735
02:14:12,168 --> 02:14:22,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I did receive a message from the mayor saying that a private company disinfected almost all city buildings and vehicles free of charge.

1736
02:14:23,076 --> 02:14:26,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it doesn't sound like all, but it sounds like they may have done some.

1737
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:27,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just says almost.

1738
02:14:29,881 --> 02:14:32,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpella, you had a question next.

1739
02:14:32,202 --> 02:14:48,768
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can, to put an amendment, I know that both yourself, the mayor, and Councilor Knight did mention it, but I think that what we're seeing right now with the public safety officials and fire and police, I think that it's important that we look at right now their

1740
02:14:50,528 --> 02:14:56,132
[SPEAKER_09]: the automobiles and the apparatus that we're using on a daily basis.

1741
02:14:56,252 --> 02:15:11,461
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some communities right now are having their DPW trucks, the fire engines, police guides, being disinfected on a daily basis for the fact that if a fire truck goes to a call where there's a possible virus infection there,

1742
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:25,610
[SPEAKER_09]: As they're coming back in they're bringing that into their apparatus and I think that having um, we should ask if we can mend this to ask the administration to look at daily, um, um

1743
02:15:27,174 --> 02:15:46,326
[SPEAKER_09]: disinfectants to every automobile apparatus, both police and fire and DPW, that they are all done on a daily basis because they're on the front lines and they're working, you know, one person, one police officer is dealing with and then leaving and another police officer.

1744
02:15:46,727 --> 02:15:49,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember, it's staying on surfaces between four to six, even 10 days.

1745
02:15:50,449 --> 02:15:54,712
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's important that we protect our public safety officials and

1746
02:15:55,172 --> 02:15:57,714
[SPEAKER_09]: and employees that are dealing with that.

1747
02:15:57,734 --> 02:15:59,835
[SPEAKER_09]: So I appreciate Councilor Knight bringing this forward.

1748
02:15:59,855 --> 02:16:11,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, make the amendment that we add, and we ask the city administration to ask for all the vehicles and apparatus be disinfected on a daily basis.

1749
02:16:11,541 --> 02:16:12,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

1750
02:16:12,441 --> 02:16:13,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Bentley.

1751
02:16:13,802 --> 02:16:14,903
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

1752
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:16,951
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1753
02:16:17,051 --> 02:16:19,133
[SPEAKER_25]: I agree with my two Councilors.

1754
02:16:19,853 --> 02:16:34,825
[SPEAKER_25]: Our public safety officials, they're the frontline workers for everything and their safety is of the utmost importance, especially if you've heard from other fire departments and police departments that our workers have been going down with this.

1755
02:16:34,845 --> 02:16:43,973
[SPEAKER_25]: So keeping our cruisers, fire apparatus, safe during these times is a very important issue and I strongly support

1756
02:16:45,313 --> 02:16:47,234
[SPEAKER_25]: this happening in the city of Medford.

1757
02:16:48,854 --> 02:16:50,215
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1758
02:16:50,275 --> 02:16:51,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1759
02:16:52,476 --> 02:16:55,138
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Councilor Knight for putting this on.

1760
02:16:55,158 --> 02:16:58,840
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Mayor Lungo-Koehn has been working on

1761
02:16:59,854 --> 02:17:02,516
[SPEAKER_15]: sanitizing many of our public buildings.

1762
02:17:03,017 --> 02:17:11,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what Councilor Scarpelli mentioned about the vehicles is an excellent idea and one that needs to be added to the sanitation.

1763
02:17:11,623 --> 02:17:14,485
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli offering that.

1764
02:17:15,666 --> 02:17:16,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1765
02:17:18,568 --> 02:17:19,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1766
02:17:20,025 --> 02:17:21,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, thank you.

1767
02:17:21,086 --> 02:17:25,148
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm very amenable to the amendments that have been offered, and I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing it forward.

1768
02:17:25,549 --> 02:17:35,995
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd also like to further amend the paper and ask that the city administration consider deploying the Park Police to enforce the congregation ban that we're seeing in our public parks.

1769
02:17:36,055 --> 02:17:37,416
[SPEAKER_18]: I drove by Barry Park the other day.

1770
02:17:37,456 --> 02:17:39,377
[SPEAKER_18]: There were two full-quote basketball games going on.

1771
02:17:39,930 --> 02:17:46,671
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's very difficult to play basketball being socially distanced to six feet apart from 10 people on a court.

1772
02:17:46,731 --> 02:17:58,774
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think there is a need for a little bit more awareness and a little bit more enforcement of some of the implements, some of the tools that have been implemented to prevent the spread and flatten the curve.

1773
02:17:59,994 --> 02:18:01,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Councilor Knight.

1774
02:18:01,734 --> 02:18:05,135
[SPEAKER_06]: While we're on the topic, if you don't mind, from the chair,

1775
02:18:07,782 --> 02:18:10,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I usually don't offer amendments from the chair, I can't.

1776
02:18:11,123 --> 02:18:22,545
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not sure if anyone would like to offer an amendment just stating whether or not, just to find out what our supply is with regard to masks or PPE for our first responders.

1777
02:18:24,405 --> 02:18:26,786
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. McPherson would be happy to offer that amendment.

1778
02:18:27,826 --> 02:18:31,807
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd like to also thank Jason Law and Annie Law

1779
02:18:32,642 --> 02:18:39,993
[SPEAKER_18]: from the Malden Asian Community Center who came yesterday and actually donated 1,000 surgical masks to the police and fire department on that behalf.

1780
02:18:40,033 --> 02:18:41,275
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would be happy to offer that amendment.

1781
02:18:41,295 --> 02:18:47,604
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd also like to extend the gratitude to the laws for the work that they did in securing 1,000 surgical masks for our public.

1782
02:18:48,383 --> 02:18:51,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, and a big thank you goes out to them as well.

1783
02:18:52,206 --> 02:18:58,310
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to be very clear though, Mr. President, and I think it's important to point out that this just isn't about the police and the fire.

1784
02:18:58,330 --> 02:19:01,472
[SPEAKER_18]: Our front line is doing a great job keeping us safe.

1785
02:19:01,532 --> 02:19:06,295
[SPEAKER_18]: It's also about people in the city clerk's office that are coming to work every day in that building.

1786
02:19:06,335 --> 02:19:12,219
[SPEAKER_18]: It's about our school custodians that are showing up to the public school buildings every day and performing maintenance and cleaning work up there.

1787
02:19:12,559 --> 02:19:14,360
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to make sure those people are protected too.

1788
02:19:15,081 --> 02:19:16,822
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't want them to get lost in the shuffle.

1789
02:19:17,432 --> 02:19:19,053
[SPEAKER_18]: My first responders are doing a great job.

1790
02:19:19,113 --> 02:19:21,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Our public safety personnel are doing a great job.

1791
02:19:21,053 --> 02:19:24,154
[SPEAKER_18]: Our DPW is doing a great job during this trying time.

1792
02:19:29,316 --> 02:19:30,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam, we lost you.

1793
02:19:34,878 --> 02:19:35,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam?

1794
02:19:37,139 --> 02:19:37,439
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1795
02:19:38,039 --> 02:19:40,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears and then Councilor Morell.

1796
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:42,681
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1797
02:19:43,021 --> 02:19:45,782
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanted to add that, you know, this is really the time to do it.

1798
02:19:46,997 --> 02:19:56,701
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we've been doing a lot of cleaning and having PP for everybody, but the latest studies show that, you know, we haven't tested enough and we don't know everybody who has this.

1799
02:19:56,962 --> 02:20:07,366
[SPEAKER_19]: And we just need to be extra careful to protect everybody, especially now as a here in Massachusetts and across other states, you know, this month we will see a significant increase in cases.

1800
02:20:07,486 --> 02:20:09,067
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think that's very important.

1801
02:20:10,228 --> 02:20:10,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1802
02:20:10,528 --> 02:20:11,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

1803
02:20:11,248 --> 02:20:15,210
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Councilor Morell, Vice President Caraviello, Councilor Morell.

1804
02:20:16,268 --> 02:20:17,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1805
02:20:17,109 --> 02:20:21,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just want to thank you for suggesting that amendment regarding the PPEs.

1806
02:20:21,472 --> 02:20:31,621
[SPEAKER_05]: In my full-time role, I've actually been transitioned away from a lot of my normal duties to really help triage an effort to coordinate donations of PPEs to facilities in need.

1807
02:20:31,721 --> 02:20:39,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm seeing these emails come through every day of facilities that you would think or you would hope have the level of PPE they need, and they certainly do not.

1808
02:20:39,787 --> 02:20:43,931
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think having a better understanding of our levels in Medford

1809
02:20:44,492 --> 02:20:59,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there is a need for more and, you know, having those numbers so we can explore making sure we're not running out and that we're not asking our first responders and just anyone who needs this kind of personal protective equipment to do without.

1810
02:20:59,848 --> 02:21:00,429
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

1811
02:21:01,089 --> 02:21:02,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Councilor Morell.

1812
02:21:02,331 --> 02:21:03,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

1813
02:21:04,379 --> 02:21:05,460
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1814
02:21:05,780 --> 02:21:08,681
[SPEAKER_25]: During this time, I want to thank H.M.

1815
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:19,507
[SPEAKER_25]: Walker and Representative Donato for getting, for them donating hand sanitizer to both the police and fire departments when there's none around.

1816
02:21:19,527 --> 02:21:21,828
[SPEAKER_25]: So I want to make sure that we thank H.M.

1817
02:21:21,849 --> 02:21:28,992
[SPEAKER_25]: Walker and Representative Donato who got the donation for the police and fire departments during this week.

1818
02:21:29,873 --> 02:21:31,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1819
02:21:32,514 --> 02:21:33,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other comments from

1820
02:21:34,335 --> 02:21:34,735
[SPEAKER_06]: the council.

1821
02:21:36,516 --> 02:21:37,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anybody else like to comment on this?

1822
02:21:39,518 --> 02:21:41,859
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise, did you receive any emails on this issue?

1823
02:21:42,420 --> 02:21:44,121
[SPEAKER_14]: I have no emails on this issue, Mr. President.

1824
02:21:45,161 --> 02:21:46,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Clerk Hurtubise.

1825

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight?

1832
02:22:08,838 --> 02:22:09,078
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1833
02:22:09,979 --> 02:22:10,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

1834
02:22:11,501 --> 02:22:11,741

[SPEAKER_06]: 20-293 offered by Council of Beers.

1843
02:22:27,011 --> 02:22:51,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration enforce Governor Baker's order and prevent all brokers, landlords, and real estate agents from showing housing units in person with current occupants during the COVID-19 pandemic, and from entering or bringing other persons into a unit which is currently occupied for reasons unrelated to the health of the occupants

1844
02:22:52,666 --> 02:23:10,117
[SPEAKER_06]: be it further ordered that the city of Medford work directly with private landlords to cease all activities that require landlords, inspectors, or assessors to enter apartments for the duration of the crisis, to cease any threat or eviction or utility shutoffs and to freeze rent payments.

1845
02:23:10,877 --> 02:23:11,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

1846
02:23:13,099 --> 02:23:14,079
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1847
02:23:14,119 --> 02:23:17,181
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, this is a moving piece.

1848
02:23:17,761 --> 02:23:21,504
[SPEAKER_19]: The intention of this resolution is to address what the city can do to

1849
02:23:22,428 --> 02:23:26,330
[SPEAKER_19]: to get out as much as possible ahead of the impending housing and economic crisis.

1850
02:23:27,290 --> 02:23:30,892
[SPEAKER_19]: I've spoken to a lot of folks over the past several days since filing this resolution.

1851
02:23:31,012 --> 02:23:41,537
[SPEAKER_19]: I know that the city is already looking into and taking some steps to assist residents, whether they're homeowners or landlords or tenants, with information about housing stability.

1852
02:23:42,738 --> 02:23:48,761
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor, the Office of Community Development, members of city boards and commissions, and some other residents are working on this.

1853
02:23:49,806 --> 02:23:56,649
[SPEAKER_19]: And I also want to especially thank the mayor for the executive order signed today that acts on the issue of showing housing units.

1854
02:23:57,449 --> 02:24:00,510
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, I have amendments again here.

1855
02:24:00,910 --> 02:24:03,571
[SPEAKER_19]: I understand some of the difficulty.

1856
02:24:03,611 --> 02:24:09,253
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to again forward those amendments to my fellow Councilors and also read them.

1857
02:24:09,954 --> 02:24:12,715
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also forwarding them to the clerk.

1858
02:24:13,895 --> 02:24:18,457
[SPEAKER_19]: So the amendments would be, and again, I just want to implore everybody

1859
02:24:19,109 --> 02:24:22,892
[SPEAKER_19]: you, this is not stopping rent or mortgage payments for anybody in Medford.

1860
02:24:23,153 --> 02:24:29,138
[SPEAKER_19]: All people are going to have to keep to that existing payment schedule unless they've come to an agreement with their landlord or their mortgage lender.

1861
02:24:29,158 --> 02:24:32,321
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just, I want to say that again, um, very clearly.

1862
02:24:33,001 --> 02:24:44,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so, uh, the amendments would be, uh, in the first paragraph, striking everything in the first paragraph, uh, after the words city administration and, uh, changing that, adding in, uh,

1863
02:24:45,808 --> 02:25:00,132
[SPEAKER_19]: amendment basically changing the first paragraph to be ordered by the Medford City Council that the city administration amend the mayor's March 31st 2020 executive order regarding the showing of housing units to specify that unoccupied housing units can still be entered.

1864
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:02,352
[SPEAKER_19]: I had obviously some language around this.

1865
02:25:02,813 --> 02:25:04,313
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a little concerned I've heard from some

1866
02:25:05,097 --> 02:25:18,682
[SPEAKER_19]: folks in real estate, that it's important that the unoccupied units, if there's people looking for housing, if there's people who've been displaced from other situations, that we can make sure that unoccupied units can still be accessed and provided to folks.

1867
02:25:19,482 --> 02:25:24,444
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wanted to ask the city administration to amend, that that's the intention of that amendment.

1868
02:25:25,625 --> 02:25:31,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Secondly, in the second paragraph, so what this paragraph does is it's

1869
02:25:32,279 --> 02:25:36,543
[SPEAKER_19]: trying to say this is what the city can do to work with all of our residents.

1870
02:25:38,204 --> 02:25:45,030
[SPEAKER_19]: I would just strike the word apartments and add housing units with current occupants, which addresses that concern.

1871
02:25:45,070 --> 02:25:49,854
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would also strike and to freeze rent payments and add the following two phrases.

1872
02:25:50,635 --> 02:25:58,221
[SPEAKER_19]: To provide information about state and federal resources regarding mortgages and other available assistance to tenants and homeowners,

1873
02:25:59,677 --> 02:26:04,279
[SPEAKER_19]: and to work with tenants and landlords facing financial hardship to address rent payments.

1874
02:26:05,159 --> 02:26:20,265
[SPEAKER_19]: So changing that language to make it clear that the city is here to provide resources and information to residents, homeowners, and tenants alike, and try to provide as many resources possible to help people who are facing financial hardship.

1875
02:26:20,886 --> 02:26:22,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Finally, I spoke to some folks in OCD.

1876
02:26:22,826 --> 02:26:24,067
[SPEAKER_19]: I would add a third paragraph.

1877
02:26:24,602 --> 02:26:35,470
[SPEAKER_19]: be it further ordered that the city of Medford established a housing stability hotline that residents can call to receive information about federal, state, and city resources regarding housing stability.

1878
02:26:37,111 --> 02:26:38,112
[SPEAKER_19]: So those are my amendments.

1879
02:26:38,172 --> 02:26:41,875
[SPEAKER_19]: I've sent that amendment language to the clerk and my fellow Councilors.

1880
02:26:42,916 --> 02:26:44,097
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1881
02:26:44,657 --> 02:26:45,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello.

1882
02:26:46,759 --> 02:26:47,499
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1883
02:26:47,899 --> 02:26:51,182
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, I'm not aware of any order signed by the mayor today.

1884
02:26:53,252 --> 02:26:59,537
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't know what Councilor Bears is alluding to with his motion there.

1885
02:27:00,778 --> 02:27:02,600
[SPEAKER_25]: Unless I didn't get it, I don't know.

1886
02:27:02,640 --> 02:27:05,422
[SPEAKER_25]: Has anyone else received this order from the mayor?

1887
02:27:06,283 --> 02:27:12,308
[SPEAKER_06]: I received, and I didn't see it till late this afternoon, just before I committed the whole meeting.

1888
02:27:13,329 --> 02:27:14,990
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a declaration of emergency.

1889
02:27:15,310 --> 02:27:17,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this what you're referring to, Councilor Bears?

1890
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:21,662
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a letter, sorry a paper, give me one second.

1891
02:27:22,202 --> 02:27:25,584
[SPEAKER_19]: It is an executive order signed by the mayor it's effective noon tomorrow.

1892
02:27:27,045 --> 02:27:29,466
[SPEAKER_19]: Trying to find where it was sent.

1893
02:27:30,867 --> 02:27:38,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, there is a number it is emergency orders 331 20, that is the title of it if that's the document that you have in front of you.

1894
02:27:38,491 --> 02:27:40,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it says declaration of emergency on it.

1895
02:27:43,550 --> 02:27:45,290
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to open it and I have a white.

1896
02:27:45,591 --> 02:27:46,691
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I have as well.

1897
02:27:47,211 --> 02:27:50,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1898
02:27:51,672 --> 02:27:54,693
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it may have come in late this afternoon.

1899
02:27:54,733 --> 02:28:01,355
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I'm looking at my stuff right now and I don't see it on my email list.

1900
02:28:01,955 --> 02:28:02,235
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1901
02:28:03,075 --> 02:28:04,155
[SPEAKER_25]: So maybe I've missed it.

1902
02:28:04,235 --> 02:28:04,656
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

1903
02:28:04,756 --> 02:28:06,936
[SPEAKER_25]: And I haven't seen it.

1904
02:28:12,045 --> 02:28:12,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Clerk Hurtubise?

1905
02:28:13,125 --> 02:28:14,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I just resent it.

1906
02:28:14,486 --> 02:28:15,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, perfect.

1907
02:28:19,147 --> 02:28:23,068
[SPEAKER_25]: Councilor Caraviello, did you wanna, do you have any other questions on that or?

1908
02:28:23,788 --> 02:28:26,489
[SPEAKER_25]: No, again, I'm not comfortable voting on something I haven't seen.

1909
02:28:26,509 --> 02:28:27,509
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1910
02:28:27,649 --> 02:28:30,450
[SPEAKER_25]: And especially amending things that I know nothing of.

1911
02:28:30,990 --> 02:28:32,831
[SPEAKER_25]: I apologize that I didn't get it.

1912
02:28:35,011 --> 02:28:37,272
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, I still don't see it in my email list there.

1913
02:28:39,785 --> 02:28:45,027
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, there's a reason there's so many amendments here is that things have been moving really fast.

1914
02:28:45,047 --> 02:28:50,230
[SPEAKER_19]: And this afternoon an order came out from the mayor that changed some of the substance of this.

1915
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:59,633
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, again, like I say, I haven't seen it, Mr. President, and I would ask that we table this the next week till everyone gets to see this.

1916
02:29:00,474 --> 02:29:05,356
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I don't know, have my other councilors seen this letter?

1917
02:29:08,648 --> 02:29:09,748
[SPEAKER_15]: I have not seen it yet.

1918
02:29:09,768 --> 02:29:12,569
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't looked at my emails in quite some time because we've been in meetings.

1919
02:29:13,169 --> 02:29:13,429
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1920
02:29:14,529 --> 02:29:14,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1921
02:29:15,389 --> 02:29:18,110
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I saw something on method patch about it.

1922
02:29:19,450 --> 02:29:23,150
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but about the, the, a letter, but then I also heard Ms.

1923
02:29:23,170 --> 02:29:26,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Catalo talk about the governor's executive order, allowing them to work.

1924
02:29:26,931 --> 02:29:28,611
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm a little confused by this.

1925
02:29:28,751 --> 02:29:31,672
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I just took an opportunity to try to look up the governor's executive order.

1926
02:29:32,192 --> 02:29:38,193
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, I really wasn't too successful with my endeavors because my computer's up there running and I was trying to do it on my phone.

1927
02:29:39,143 --> 02:29:49,432
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think ultimately, Mr. President, this is why it's very important that we have a unified message coming from the administration when it comes to this stuff related to COVID-19 and the pandemic.

1928
02:29:50,513 --> 02:29:55,658
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that we can't be sending mixed signals and mixed information, and it has to come from one centralized source.

1929
02:29:56,319 --> 02:30:00,122
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think we might be getting a little bit ahead of ourselves here when it comes to some of this stuff.

1930
02:30:01,023 --> 02:30:03,365
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, Mr. President, I mean, I think all of us

1931
02:30:03,848 --> 02:30:09,373
[SPEAKER_18]: are very concerned about what's going to happen to people in terms of their living situation and their housing situation.

1932
02:30:09,953 --> 02:30:15,538
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're all well aware of the fact that the role of government is to provide services.

1933
02:30:15,778 --> 02:30:18,860
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is going to be a service that's necessary for the residents in our community.

1934
02:30:19,641 --> 02:30:23,504
[SPEAKER_18]: So I certainly have no problem setting up a housing stabilization telephone line.

1935
02:30:24,765 --> 02:30:28,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Do I think that that's something that we have a department for right now in the city?

1936
02:30:28,688 --> 02:30:29,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really.

1937
02:30:29,129 --> 02:30:30,890
[SPEAKER_18]: It'll probably have to go through the office

1938
02:30:34,193 --> 02:30:35,213
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam, we lost your volume.

1939
02:30:35,233 --> 02:30:39,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam.

1940
02:30:39,414 --> 02:30:46,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this better?

1941
02:30:47,455 --> 02:30:47,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1942
02:30:48,296 --> 02:30:49,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

1943
02:30:49,716 --> 02:30:52,436
[SPEAKER_18]: On my full screen, it goes unstable.

1944
02:30:55,857 --> 02:31:00,818
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think it's very important that we somewhat get a concise and

1945
02:31:02,746 --> 02:31:08,090
[SPEAKER_18]: and pointed message that's in line with the administration going forward when it comes to this coronavirus stuff.

1946
02:31:09,471 --> 02:31:11,972
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, I support Councilor Kavya.

1947
02:31:12,012 --> 02:31:15,855
[SPEAKER_18]: I hope he's uncomfortable with something once another week, and I'd certainly second that measure.

1948
02:31:16,375 --> 02:31:20,878
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think it's gonna be anything that's gonna cure the coronavirus in a week that the Medford City Council is gonna do.

1949
02:31:21,779 --> 02:31:23,760
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, the Council needs another week.

1950
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:25,341
[SPEAKER_18]: I certainly support his position.

1951
02:31:26,162 --> 02:31:30,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the motion on the floor is to table this resolution

1952
02:31:31,983 --> 02:31:34,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

1953
02:31:34,765 --> 02:31:43,330
[SPEAKER_19]: Given that the mayor's order has essentially put much of this, at least a piece of this, into effect today, I would be happy to table till next week.

1954
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:46,571
[SPEAKER_19]: I am working with Alicia Hunt and some other folks.

1955
02:31:46,611 --> 02:31:51,314
[SPEAKER_19]: I've talked about this with Alicia and folks in the Office of Community Development about the hotline, about how it could be staffed.

1956
02:31:51,394 --> 02:31:57,518
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm happy to work with them over the next week and talk about this next week if needed.

1957
02:31:59,159 --> 02:32:01,340
[SPEAKER_19]: The urgency of this was about showing units

1958
02:32:01,957 --> 02:32:05,100
[SPEAKER_19]: that have people in them and having other people coming into housing.

1959
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:13,769
[SPEAKER_19]: While, you know, people who are living there are living there and the effects that that could pose that's been addressed by the mayor's order.

1960
02:32:14,309 --> 02:32:14,930
[SPEAKER_19]: I do have

1961
02:32:16,199 --> 02:32:22,964
[SPEAKER_19]: some concerns that the order does not exempt unoccupied units, which could be an issue, but I think that can wait till next week.

1962
02:32:23,625 --> 02:32:26,707
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm okay holding that till next week.

1963
02:32:26,988 --> 02:32:29,790
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to stop here anyway, because the motion to table is undebatable.

1964
02:32:29,850 --> 02:32:38,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So the motion to table by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor... Clerk Urnabes, please call the roll.

1965
02:32:39,077 --> 02:32:39,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1966
02:32:41,279 --> 02:32:41,539
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1967
02:32:42,940 --> 02:32:43,841
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Caraviello.

1968
02:32:44,402 --> 02:32:44,602
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1969
02:32:45,434 --> 02:32:45,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

1970
02:32:46,295 --> 02:32:46,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1971
02:32:47,416 --> 02:32:47,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1972
02:32:49,037 --> 02:32:49,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1973
02:32:50,198 --> 02:32:50,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1974
02:32:51,399 --> 02:32:51,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1975
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:52,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1976
02:32:53,481 --> 02:32:53,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1977
02:32:54,282 --> 02:32:55,023
[SPEAKER_14]: President Falco.

1978
02:32:55,423 --> 02:32:55,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1979
02:32:55,723 --> 02:32:57,525
[SPEAKER_06]: 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1980
02:32:57,545 --> 02:32:59,727
[SPEAKER_06]: The resolution has been tabled.

1981
02:33:06,317 --> 02:33:08,938
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-294 offered by Councilor Bears.

1982
02:33:08,978 --> 02:33:18,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council formally express its deepest condolences to the family and friends of Larry Rasky for their tremendous loss.

1983
02:33:18,421 --> 02:33:27,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a suitably engrossed copy of this resolution to the family of Larry Rasky on behalf of the entire Medford City Council.

1984
02:33:28,825 --> 02:33:29,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears.

1985
02:33:31,286 --> 02:33:32,307
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1986
02:33:33,655 --> 02:33:35,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know how many people know Larry Rasky.

1987
02:33:36,276 --> 02:33:39,798
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been involved in Massachusetts politics for a very long time.

1988
02:33:39,818 --> 02:33:48,142
[SPEAKER_19]: I was lucky enough in 2012 and 2013 to intern at Rasky Behrlein, and that has helped me tremendously going forward.

1989
02:33:48,362 --> 02:33:54,225
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm also friends with Larry's son, Will, actually through some work that we've done together as well.

1990
02:33:54,945 --> 02:33:55,765
[SPEAKER_19]: Larry passed away.

1991
02:33:55,825 --> 02:33:59,267
[SPEAKER_19]: His family has released that he passed away of coronavirus complications.

1992
02:33:59,427 --> 02:34:00,748
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a very sad loss.

1993
02:34:01,878 --> 02:34:12,464
[SPEAKER_19]: for us here in Massachusetts, it really brings home to me, um, you know, having someone that I know as a friend to lose their parent to this, and also someone that I knew as having been an intern.

1994
02:34:12,504 --> 02:34:19,589
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that Larry means a lot to a lot of people, um, I believe to our, to our clerk and to, to others as well.

1995
02:34:19,989 --> 02:34:24,632
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and there've been a lot, a lot of outpouring and support of, uh, their family.

1996
02:34:24,672 --> 02:34:30,315
[SPEAKER_19]: And obviously the circumstances here really make this a very tough time to mourn, um, with the inability to,

1997
02:34:31,050 --> 02:34:35,754
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a lot of friends and family that are in the same situation.

1998
02:34:36,554 --> 02:34:42,619
[SPEAKER_19]: I just send my deepest condolences and I hope we can all send ours as well.

1999
02:34:57,748 --> 02:35:03,813
[SPEAKER_18]: a young boy, age 19, when I first started my foray into government work.

2000
02:35:03,993 --> 02:35:07,395
[SPEAKER_18]: And what a brilliant communications specialist Mr. Rasky was.

2001
02:35:07,415 --> 02:35:14,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Rasky Communications and Rasky Berlin were, you know, paramount when it came to consultants in the political business.

2002
02:35:15,561 --> 02:35:20,445
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, walking around the halls of the State House, Larry Rasky was always someone that everybody stopped and listened to.

2003
02:35:20,485 --> 02:35:21,506
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a wise...

2004
02:35:27,316 --> 02:35:28,357
[SPEAKER_13]: We just lost you again.

2005
02:35:28,377 --> 02:35:29,077
[SPEAKER_13]: We lost you again.

2006
02:35:31,098 --> 02:35:40,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Can't hear you.

2007
02:35:40,243 --> 02:35:42,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Adam, we still can't hear you.

2008
02:35:47,407 --> 02:35:47,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

2009
02:35:49,788 --> 02:35:50,169
[SPEAKER_13]: You bet.

2010
02:35:53,711 --> 02:35:56,072
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, looks like we may have

2011
02:35:56,485 --> 02:35:57,787
[SPEAKER_06]: temporary lost counsel all night.

2012
02:35:57,807 --> 02:36:06,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So at this point, I would ask that we all rise for a brief moment of silence for Larry Rasky and his family.

2013
02:36:06,702 --> 02:36:08,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Our thoughts and prayers are with them.

2014
02:36:08,205 --> 02:36:09,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Please rise.

2015
02:36:26,598 --> 02:36:38,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2016
02:36:39,125 --> 02:36:39,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2017
02:36:39,385 --> 02:36:40,986
[SPEAKER_06]: 20-295 offered by Councilor Morell.

2018
02:36:41,666 --> 02:36:54,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the city solicitor provide a draft ordinance establishing a permitting program to support regulation of donation collection bins in the City of Medford example framework for such

2019
02:36:55,706 --> 02:36:57,146
[SPEAKER_06]: in ordnance appears below.

2020
02:36:58,887 --> 02:36:59,407
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may.

2021
02:36:59,427 --> 02:37:00,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2022
02:37:01,507 --> 02:37:04,848
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you're going to say be a motion to waive the reading of the example framework.

2023
02:37:06,088 --> 02:37:11,730
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great but I also was going to mention a console copy hello had a resolution to 0 dash 045.

2024
02:37:11,770 --> 02:37:12,530
[SPEAKER_06]: He was on our agenda January 28.

2025
02:37:18,096 --> 02:37:28,846
[SPEAKER_06]: In that, Councilor Caraviello, feel free to comment if you want, but I think it was similar to this and it was sent to the city solicitor to create a draft ordinance.

2026
02:37:28,906 --> 02:37:29,466
[SPEAKER_25]: Am I correct?

2027
02:37:30,067 --> 02:37:31,148
[SPEAKER_25]: You are correct, Mr. President.

2028
02:37:31,228 --> 02:37:38,875
[SPEAKER_25]: And I did send her a language from two other cities that was provided to me by the owner of Planet Aid.

2029
02:37:40,086 --> 02:37:43,488
[SPEAKER_25]: where they work in a lot of cities.

2030
02:37:43,568 --> 02:37:50,672
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, I know at this time, we're a little bogged down with other things.

2031
02:37:50,712 --> 02:37:55,454
[SPEAKER_25]: So I don't know if the solicitor has gotten a chance to us, but she does have the language that I sent her.

2032
02:37:55,974 --> 02:37:59,376
[SPEAKER_25]: And I say, this is something we did a couple of months ago.

2033
02:37:59,396 --> 02:38:02,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2034
02:38:03,858 --> 02:38:05,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Member Earl, do you want to withdraw this or?

2035
02:38:07,210 --> 02:38:08,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, I'll withdraw.

2036
02:38:08,211 --> 02:38:10,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't find it in the, um, I was looking through the agendas.

2037
02:38:10,832 --> 02:38:12,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I sort of looked through the minutes with the agendas.

2038
02:38:12,493 --> 02:38:15,515
[SPEAKER_05]: This was an, uh, I think this was an amendment to actually add the permitting.

2039
02:38:15,595 --> 02:38:18,117
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, I couldn't find it in the agendas.

2040
02:38:18,257 --> 02:38:19,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I can withdraw this.

2041
02:38:20,158 --> 02:38:20,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, no problem.

2042
02:38:20,898 --> 02:38:31,445
[SPEAKER_15]: And if, if, you know, make a recommendation rather than withdraw, why don't we just send this paper to a company, the paper, the council vice president put forward already.

2043
02:38:33,206 --> 02:38:33,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2044
02:38:34,286 --> 02:38:34,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2045
02:38:34,566 --> 02:38:34,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do that.

2046
02:38:36,322 --> 02:38:46,190
[SPEAKER_05]: just the reason for, just to speak on it, the reason for this coming up is I'm sure everyone saw, or a lot of people saw the bins in the Aldi's parking lot.

2047
02:38:46,310 --> 02:38:49,793
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just an incredible amount of things dumped in front of them.

2048
02:38:49,813 --> 02:38:55,077
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the mayor, she acted on this very quickly and she was able to get people out to clean it up.

2049
02:38:55,098 --> 02:39:02,243
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, I understand that we are in strange times right now and things aren't moving as fast as they normally would.

2050
02:39:02,283 --> 02:39:04,305
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this is actually an issue of public health

2051
02:39:04,720 --> 02:39:11,185
[SPEAKER_05]: and we had to divert resources last week, city resources to go clean up this mess that shouldn't be there in the first place.

2052
02:39:11,205 --> 02:39:20,232
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think this is something that we do need to, whether it's following up the city solicitor and we'll send this along this framework as well to help guide that.

2053
02:39:20,272 --> 02:39:23,374
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it is something we do need to move on.

2054
02:39:25,015 --> 02:39:26,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Councilor Morell.

2055
02:39:27,917 --> 02:39:29,138
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President.

2056
02:39:29,178 --> 02:39:29,959
[SPEAKER_25]: Vice President Caraviello.

2057
02:39:31,051 --> 02:39:37,312
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, what's happening right now is, Joe, people are at home and everyone's starting to clean up their attics and their cellars.

2058
02:39:38,073 --> 02:39:41,933
[SPEAKER_25]: And no matter where you go, you're seeing these boxes overwhelmed.

2059
02:39:42,934 --> 02:39:47,835
[SPEAKER_25]: Again, as I say, just people have time on their hands now to do all the stuff they didn't do before.

2060
02:39:48,215 --> 02:39:50,355
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that's a big part of the reason.

2061
02:39:52,356 --> 02:39:56,937
[SPEAKER_25]: I've driven around to other areas, too, and I've seen the boxes overflowing no matter where you go.

2062
02:39:58,611 --> 02:40:02,612
[SPEAKER_25]: people just clean their attics and cellars out now because of the space they have.

2063
02:40:03,052 --> 02:40:03,833
[SPEAKER_25]: That's part of the problem.

2064
02:40:05,453 --> 02:40:06,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

2065
02:40:07,834 --> 02:40:11,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Would anybody else like to comment on this?

2066
02:40:11,535 --> 02:40:16,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Or may I ask the city clerk, do you have any emails that have come in from?

2067
02:40:16,116 --> 02:40:20,978
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any other emails on this topic.

2068
02:40:21,018 --> 02:40:21,378
[SPEAKER_14]: No, sir.

2069
02:40:21,758 --> 02:40:22,198
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2070
02:40:22,278 --> 02:40:22,938
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Bears.

2071
02:40:24,259 --> 02:40:24,759
[SPEAKER_19]: It's actually a

2072
02:40:25,206 --> 02:40:28,927
[SPEAKER_19]: A point of information through the chair to Councilor Marks, perhaps or Councilor Morell.

2073
02:40:28,987 --> 02:40:33,449
[SPEAKER_19]: Have those boxes also as a Fuzzway been removed in addition to the stuff being cleaned up or?

2074
02:40:36,570 --> 02:40:37,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Got it, thank you.

2075
02:40:38,851 --> 02:40:43,232
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, thank you.

2076
02:40:44,453 --> 02:40:49,594
[SPEAKER_25]: I was told that they were there without permission also of the landlord of the property.

2077
02:40:49,994 --> 02:40:50,635
[SPEAKER_06]: That's even worse.

2078
02:40:52,715 --> 02:40:54,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

2079
02:40:55,004 --> 02:41:09,891
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Marks, to forward this resolution to the city solicitor to accompany the previous resolution 20-045.

2080
02:41:09,931 --> 02:41:10,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Please call the roll.

2081
02:41:11,032 --> 02:41:13,853

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_14]: President Falco?

2094
02:41:34,669 --> 02:41:34,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2095
02:41:35,129 --> 02:41:37,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2096
02:41:39,613 --> 02:41:45,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Communications from the Mayor, 20-296 to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council.

2097
02:41:51,276 --> 02:42:01,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves a special budgetary transfer from the DPW highway overtime account

2098
02:42:02,258 --> 02:42:08,800
[SPEAKER_06]: 010-421-5130-1104 to DPW Highway Vehicles Account 010-421-5850 in the amount of $102,538.00 to serve as the 28% grant match to purchase a trash truck and two dump trucks.

2099
02:42:08,820 --> 02:42:10,300
[SPEAKER_06]: The DPW received a grant from

2100
02:42:30,193 --> 02:42:34,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass DEP totaling $360,000 for these purchases.

2101
02:42:37,397 --> 02:42:43,381
[SPEAKER_06]: City Public Works Commissioner Brian Kearns is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

2102
02:42:43,461 --> 02:42:46,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely, Rear Admiral Mungo Kern, Mayor.

2103
02:42:48,384 --> 02:42:49,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk Hurtubise.

2104
02:42:49,665 --> 02:42:55,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, Mr. Kerns is actually in my office, so I'm going to step away from my desk and let him sit in front of my, let him sit in my chair.

2105
02:42:56,369 --> 02:42:56,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2106
02:42:57,250 --> 02:42:59,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the councilors have any questions for

2107
02:43:03,578 --> 02:43:07,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, let's wait for Mr. Kearns to get into position here.

2108
02:43:08,322 --> 02:43:12,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, members of the Council.

2109
02:43:13,346 --> 02:43:13,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

2110
02:43:15,568 --> 02:43:20,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight was saying hello.

2111
02:43:22,990 --> 02:43:33,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, Mr. President, you have in front of you a rare opportunity that came up through the efforts of Alicia Hunt in her office.

2112
02:43:34,239 --> 02:43:41,525
[SPEAKER_11]: The DEP had a grant program that was available for

2113
02:43:42,650 --> 02:43:48,856
[SPEAKER_11]: the turning over of what we call in our line of business, dirty diesels.

2114
02:43:50,337 --> 02:43:56,442
[SPEAKER_11]: The trucks have to meet a certain threshold in order to be eligible to be turned in.

2115
02:43:56,983 --> 02:44:02,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Fortunately enough, we had three trucks online that fit that criteria.

2116
02:44:03,428 --> 02:44:10,110
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a lot of paperwork, obviously, on our part that had to be submitted to justify and commit.

2117
02:44:10,971 --> 02:44:21,054
[SPEAKER_11]: And we were very successful on getting, well, for two of the trucks, it's 79.9% of the cost.

2118
02:44:21,114 --> 02:44:24,735
[SPEAKER_11]: The third truck, which is actually the packer,

2119
02:44:25,305 --> 02:44:27,047
[SPEAKER_11]: We got an actual 80% of it.

2120
02:44:27,207 --> 02:44:36,118
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to give you a quick snapshot of the cost of the vehicles themselves, all right?

2121
02:44:36,759 --> 02:44:42,806
[SPEAKER_11]: If you were to just go and buy them, all right?

2122
02:44:42,926 --> 02:44:43,747
[SPEAKER_11]: You're talking, okay.

2123
02:44:44,200 --> 02:44:53,704
[SPEAKER_11]: on the award grant was $126,000 for the Packer, $117,000 in change for the two dump trucks.

2124
02:44:54,484 --> 02:44:59,406
[SPEAKER_11]: The difference of money that the city would have to pay out would be $33,000 for two,

2125
02:45:02,748 --> 02:45:08,091
[SPEAKER_11]: and $34,000 in change for, again, the PAC, or for a total of $102,538.

2126
02:45:08,231 --> 02:45:16,457
[SPEAKER_11]: The reason it was identified to take out of the highway overtime account really is twofold.

2127
02:45:16,977 --> 02:45:31,286
[SPEAKER_11]: One, these are highway trucks assigned to the highway department, though other departments, okay, when they're in need of extra trucks, you know, do borrow them, we pull them around, but their primary responsibility is within the highway department.

2128
02:45:32,487 --> 02:45:47,078
[SPEAKER_11]: But as well as that, we have to have these trucks, the purchase order, built, shipped, and registered within a total of 18 months.

2129
02:45:47,278 --> 02:45:52,401
[SPEAKER_11]: Rule of thumb, it takes an average of a year to get one of these trucks built.

2130
02:45:55,821 --> 02:46:03,987
[SPEAKER_11]: they are specialized to a point, but the trucks, well, up to this point were in such demand, there's a long waiting list.

2131
02:46:04,648 --> 02:46:16,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, if we risk going over the 18 months, then the DEP has come right out and said, all right, that we would be risking losing the grant from them.

2132
02:46:18,458 --> 02:46:18,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2133
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:22,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Kearns.

2134
02:46:24,094 --> 02:46:27,316
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a number of questions from the council set up console and I think console appears.

2135
02:46:28,917 --> 02:46:33,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, so in this, what it looks like is we're getting 72%.

2136
02:46:33,820 --> 02:46:40,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

2137
02:46:42,026 --> 02:46:44,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor for two of the trucks, each 79.9%.

2138
02:46:47,368 --> 02:46:50,569
[SPEAKER_11]: and then the packer or the garbage truck is 80%.

2139
02:46:51,570 --> 02:46:52,930
[SPEAKER_18]: 80%, okay.

2140
02:46:52,990 --> 02:46:59,613
[SPEAKER_18]: So ultimately we're making an investment of up to about a quarter of the value of these vehicles and we're getting 75% return on this investment?

2141
02:47:00,894 --> 02:47:02,014
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly, Councilor.

2142
02:47:02,074 --> 02:47:08,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Keeping in mind the trucks that we'd be taking offline, all three of them are 2002s.

2143
02:47:08,437 --> 02:47:09,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

2144
02:47:10,898 --> 02:47:12,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, sounds like a good deal to me.

2145
02:47:12,458 --> 02:47:13,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Move for approval.

2146
02:47:13,659 --> 02:47:14,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2147
02:47:14,099 --> 02:47:15,860
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by...

2148
02:47:16,545 --> 02:47:17,226
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2149
02:47:17,687 --> 02:47:19,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Caraviello, Consular Affairs.

2150
02:47:21,074 --> 02:47:22,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Brian, I just had a quick question for you.

2151
02:47:22,657 --> 02:47:23,618
[SPEAKER_19]: This sounds like a great deal.

2152
02:47:23,659 --> 02:47:24,520
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm glad it's happening.

2153
02:47:25,877 --> 02:47:29,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Are these new vehicles more energy efficient?

2154
02:47:29,138 --> 02:47:30,859
[SPEAKER_19]: What you said, we're taking dirty diesel off.

2155
02:47:30,899 --> 02:47:33,879
[SPEAKER_19]: So what does this exactly do on the environmental side?

2156
02:47:34,660 --> 02:47:47,444
[SPEAKER_11]: What that is, Councilor, is the dirty diesels were not equipped with any kind of anti-pollution devices, just like the old smelly diesel buses that we used to experience at the NBA.

2157
02:47:47,484 --> 02:47:53,605
[SPEAKER_11]: These have anti-pollution devices that recycle the gases before they're admitted to the air.

2158
02:47:54,966 --> 02:47:55,246
[SPEAKER_19]: Got it.

2159
02:47:55,998 --> 02:47:56,418
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

2160
02:47:56,598 --> 02:48:02,602
[SPEAKER_19]: And it would be just to clarify again, so we'd be taking three current trucks off and adding these three new ones.

2161
02:48:02,982 --> 02:48:03,583
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

2162
02:48:03,943 --> 02:48:11,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be taking two 2002 dump trucks offline and one 2002 garbage truck.

2163
02:48:11,948 --> 02:48:14,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be taking that offline as well.

2164
02:48:14,749 --> 02:48:18,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what I have to do is I have to render these trucks

2165
02:48:19,433 --> 02:48:19,833
[SPEAKER_11]: useless.

2166
02:48:20,594 --> 02:48:33,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, I have to destroy them once the new trucks come in, and they want pictures that have actually destroyed the trucks so they're not resold on the market, okay, in some used truck dealership.

2167
02:48:35,108 --> 02:48:40,193
[SPEAKER_19]: Brian, when they're rendered useless, will we sell it for parts and scrap, or will there still be something there?

2168
02:48:41,506 --> 02:48:52,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, Councilor, the first thing I got to do is I have to have our mechanics, okay, drill four holes into the engine block, two on each side, all right, right off the bat.

2169
02:48:52,732 --> 02:48:57,175
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after that, all right, you know, cut the cab up or cut the frame of the truck or whatever.

2170
02:48:57,195 --> 02:49:01,897
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so it's basically scrap value at that point is what we would get.

2171
02:49:02,218 --> 02:49:06,840
[SPEAKER_11]: They just want to, you know, proof, you know, pictures proving that we did do that.

2172
02:49:08,761 --> 02:49:09,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Got it.

2173
02:49:09,061 --> 02:49:09,642
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

2174
02:49:09,662 --> 02:49:10,422
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

2175
02:49:10,850 --> 02:49:11,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

2176
02:49:12,150 --> 02:49:13,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from the council?

2177
02:49:16,812 --> 02:49:17,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2178
02:49:18,853 --> 02:49:24,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, actually, are there any other comments from anyone?

2179
02:49:24,395 --> 02:49:26,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any.

2180
02:49:27,096 --> 02:49:30,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight, Clerk Hurtubise, any emails?

2181
02:49:30,597 --> 02:49:31,897
[SPEAKER_14]: There are no emails, Mr. President.

2182
02:49:32,377 --> 02:49:34,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Clerk Hurtubise.

2183
02:49:34,798 --> 02:49:38,079
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caraviello.

[SPEAKER_06]: Records.

2205
02:50:21,735 --> 02:50:29,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Can someone make a, if someone wouldn't mind, make a motion to table the committee reports?

2206
02:50:30,002 --> 02:50:31,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, can I make a motion under suspension?

2207
02:50:31,643 --> 02:50:33,425
[SPEAKER_16]: I might make a motion to suspend the rules, Mr. President.

2208
02:50:34,586 --> 02:50:39,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I make a motion of council tonight to suspend the rules, seconded by... Second.

[SPEAKER_14]: All right, this is to suspend the rules.

2212
02:51:00,062 --> 02:51:00,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

2213
02:51:02,183 --> 02:51:02,543
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2214
02:51:03,704 --> 02:51:04,544

2219
02:51:10,007 --> 02:51:10,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2220
02:51:10,787 --> 02:51:11,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

2221
02:51:11,968 --> 02:51:12,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2222
02:51:13,068 --> 02:51:13,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2223
02:51:17,350 --> 02:51:18,051
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2224
02:51:20,732 --> 02:51:21,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, yes.

2225
02:51:24,914 --> 02:51:28,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, semi-affirmative zero in the negative, the rules are suspended.

2226
02:51:29,872 --> 02:51:30,392
[SPEAKER_16]: about the night.

2227
02:51:32,074 --> 02:51:37,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I do believe earlier this evening we had a subcommittee meeting for paper 20-042.

2228
02:51:39,119 --> 02:51:45,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and that actually is going to be coming up on a future agenda.

2229
02:51:45,844 --> 02:51:46,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

2230
02:51:46,444 --> 02:51:49,246
[SPEAKER_06]: We originally thought that it had to be passed by tomorrow.

2231
02:51:52,308 --> 02:51:52,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't hear you.

2232
02:51:55,470 --> 02:51:55,891
[SPEAKER_13]: He said,

2233
02:52:06,847 --> 02:52:16,191
[SPEAKER_16]: It's almost done.

2234
02:52:16,571 --> 02:52:17,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I can add clarity.

2235
02:52:17,892 --> 02:52:24,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So this just has to be, when I checked with DLS, this just has to be passed by the end of June for it to go into effect for FY21.

2236
02:52:25,796 --> 02:52:26,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have time to pass it.

2237
02:52:27,057 --> 02:52:31,360
[SPEAKER_05]: We obviously should move on it as soon as possible so we don't forget or lose it or whatever.

2238
02:52:32,040 --> 02:52:36,804
[SPEAKER_05]: But we way missed the deadline to pass this for FY20.

2239
02:52:36,824 --> 02:52:38,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That would have had to have been done last June.

2240
02:52:39,025 --> 02:52:40,806
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at FY21 for this.

2241
02:52:41,667 --> 02:52:43,608
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2242
02:52:43,648 --> 02:52:46,050
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I withdraw my motion to suspend the rules.

2243
02:52:46,791 --> 02:52:48,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2244
02:52:49,072 --> 02:52:49,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

2245
02:52:50,973 --> 02:52:56,158
[SPEAKER_06]: So clicker to bees, we're going to have the, uh, that will be on next week's agenda.

2246
02:52:56,939 --> 02:52:57,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2247
02:52:57,860 --> 02:53:03,466
[SPEAKER_06]: The, the item from committee, the whole tonight.

2248
02:53:04,707 --> 02:53:14,357
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're on the suspension, if I could just bring up, uh, we had a recent loss of, uh, a long time method resident, Sam Musto, uh, family man, father.

2249
02:53:15,207 --> 02:53:16,669
[SPEAKER_15]: just dedicated to this community.

2250
02:53:17,430 --> 02:53:25,398
[SPEAKER_15]: And he recently passed a long time labor in the community, and he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

2251
02:53:25,878 --> 02:53:26,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

2252
02:53:26,819 --> 02:53:27,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

2253
02:53:28,961 --> 02:53:33,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't we, at this point, why don't we all rise for a brief moment of silence.

2254
02:53:58,433 --> 02:53:59,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we have reports of committees.

2255
02:54:00,574 --> 02:54:04,855
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could please table all those till the next meeting.

2256
02:54:04,875 --> 02:54:10,858
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Caraviello to table 19-287, 20-081, 20-087.

2257
02:54:10,878 --> 02:54:13,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are all reports of committees on that motion to table.

2258
02:54:13,339 --> 02:54:14,799
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

2259
02:54:14,839 --> 02:54:16,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, clicker to be spoken on the roll.

2260
02:54:31,373 --> 02:54:31,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears?

2261
02:54:32,734 --> 02:54:33,014
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2262
02:54:34,035 --> 02:54:34,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Caraviello?

2263
02:54:35,576 --> 02:54:35,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2264
02:54:36,556 --> 02:54:37,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight?

2265
02:54:37,597 --> 02:54:37,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2266
02:54:38,578 --> 02:54:39,118
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

2267
02:54:39,979 --> 02:54:40,259
