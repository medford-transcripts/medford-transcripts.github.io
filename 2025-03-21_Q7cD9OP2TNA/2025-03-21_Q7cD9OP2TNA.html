    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=0.689s">The</a>  27th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6.213s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=10.355s">Councilor</a>  Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=21.683s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=22.783s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=23.684s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=24.945s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=25.725s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=26.546s">Vice</a>  President Lungo-Koehn? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=27.406s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=28.327s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=29.208s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=29.94s">Council</a>  Penta, President Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=32.402s">Present</a>  with seven present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=36.165s">Please</a>  rise to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=41.19s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=60.335s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions 15-644 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the City of Medford purchase the Aqua Hawk system and install it within the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=75.401s">The</a>  system would be applied to individual water meters as an individual meter leak detection system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=82.144s">This</a>  purchase and installation would relieve rate payers from having to pay substantial sums <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=88.577s">due</a>  to leaks they were unaware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=91.138s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the city council hold a meeting, committee meeting, to discuss a detection system to monitor leaks within our waterline infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=102.485s">Past</a>  leaks within our infrastructure have cost the rate payer a substantial amount of money, and we need to work to avoid this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=112.911s">Madam</a>  Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=116.092s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=117.862s">President</a>  Dello Russo, I put this on the agenda and it's probably actually long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=123.925s">I</a>  know that we've had people at the podium who've come up, who've had leaks in their homes, who've been upset and had to displace a large amount of money when a leak probably could have been prevented or they could have been notified of such a leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=139.611s">We</a>  field complaints all the time with regards to the water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=144.355s">rates</a>  and also, you know, people that have leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=147.677s">And</a>  recently I've got a couple complaints and it's unfortunate, but it's a city's policy that the Water and Sewer Commission cannot abate for leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=158.445s">I</a>  spoke to somebody on the Water and Sewer Commission and he blankly stated that at times it breaks his heart when he has a family or, you know, people who come in and cannot afford, they didn't know about the leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=171.582s">They</a>  get a $1,000 bill because of a leak, and they can't afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=175.485s">Now,</a>  we as a council years ago voted for the new meters, which we believed at the time would have a leak detection system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=182.909s">And</a>  if somebody was running a leak or ran a leak and had gone on vacation, they'd be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=189.294s">Somehow,</a>  we contacted and told that they have a leak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=193.356s">We</a>  don't currently have that in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=196.438s">I</a>  know the Water and Sewer Commission has discussed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=199.992s">with</a>  regards to residential homes, and there is something called the Aquahawk system, which can be used and it's placed on individual water meters within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=212.135s">I</a>  think for the price, it's less than $25,000 to install throughout our whole community, but that would save our individual rate payers that happen to have a leak here and there a large, large amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=229.925s">the</a>  pain that they go through, that some individual family would go through or is going through now, a great amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=240.571s">I</a>  actually, the commissioner, engineer from a surrounding community, I won't say it specifically, but the city engineer from a surrounding community, actually, this happened to her recently, and she's very educated on the subject, and it really got my mind <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=258.337s">You</a>  know, she really enlightened me to a number of things and that got me talking to Dominic Camara and the Water and Sewer Commission and this is something that needs to be really looked into and implemented within the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=274.394s">This</a>  is actually for individual residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=277.705s">Now,</a>  the larger system, it would obviously be more money, so we definitely need to sit down and have a committee meeting on it, be educated by the Water and Sewer Commission from what they know of it, the city engineer's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=292.869s">It</a>  would alleviate the problem with regards to the leaks we have in the miles of pipes we have throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=300.551s">I</a>  know it's not a sexy issue, but <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=303.352s">We</a>  had a leak a couple years ago, and one of those water lines was leaking a million gallons a day until we caught it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=310.434s">The</a>  MWRA had detection systems that were able to catch that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=315.255s">But</a>  if the city had something in place, we'd be able to catch these leaks within our own infrastructure much faster than we can catch them now, saving the taxpayer and the ratepayer a tremendous amount of money down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=330.416s">I</a>  think it's an important issue, and I think especially the residential portion of it is important, and it's something that should be implemented as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=340.639s">I'm</a>  not sure if the administration is in discussions with it, but I know the Water and Sewer Commission is, and I hope to send a paper and make it clear to our new mayor in January that this is something that needs to be implemented to alleviate repay his concerns and <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=358.758s">anybody</a>  who suffers from anything that so happens to be a leak within their home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=365.282s">It's</a>  definitely some of the stories I've been hearing and stories we've heard over the years through complaints and concerns, they are, they're heartbreaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=373.807s">And</a>  if somebody's used to a $200 a quarter and they get a bill for 1,000 plus or 700 or some of the stories, 800 that I've been hearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=386.437s">And</a>  that could be resolved with the simple Aquahawk system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=390.8s">I</a>  think it's something we need to implement.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=393.702s">Thank</a>  you very much for that important measure, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=396.704s">May</a>  I take this opportunity to point out that the unfortunate thing of all this is that the system we have in place now was sold to us with the point of having this capability built into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=412.315s">It's</a>  unfortunate we have to have this discussion now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=414.936s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=416.641s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=418.321s">And</a>  I'd like to commend Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=423.302s">I</a>  do believe it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=425.403s">When</a>  this program first went into inception, a gentleman by the name of Don Ouellette at the time said that we would have similar software to detect leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=434.984s">And</a>  also that unnamed city engineer from a surrounding community who brings a wealth of knowledge to our community as a resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=443.286s">I</a>  want to commend her and thank her as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=446.262s">With</a>  that being said, I support this wholeheartedly, and I think this is something that can't wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=451.546s">Because</a>  just over the past few weeks, I know two people, one in particular with a water bill that went up about $1,000 in the water bill because of a leak in the lawn sprinkler irrigation system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=464.677s">It</a>  just kept going, going, and going. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=466.198s">So</a>  I do support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=468.34s">And</a>  once again, I'd like to thank Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=473.984s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=476.468s">So</a>  on the motion for Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=480.529s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=482.83s">And</a>  I, and I too would like to thank Council Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=486.091s">Um,</a>  as was mentioned, um, this, uh, potential, um, system, uh, would be a cost savings, uh, for anyone that potentially has a leak in their home and something that I believe, uh, the city should be the watchdog, uh, alerting people, um, that, uh, there could be a potential issue within your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=506.346s">You</a>  know, we have people that go away for months on end to Florida or wherever else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=512.728s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate that if, God forbid, something happened internally in your house, that the city would be able to get a contact number and reach out and say, we see a spike in your water over this period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=525.27s">And</a>  I think that is only appropriate that we offer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=530.072s">It</a>  was also mentioned by Councilor Longo that, you know, we have the capability currently <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=536.777s">to</a>  install this, and we were sold the bill of goods back some years ago that the system we were putting in did have this software, and for whatever reason, it never came to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=548.844s">But</a>  currently right now, unaccounted for water, which every water and sewer rate payer pays for, is roughly 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=558.549s">So</a>  20% of our total water and sewer bill as a community is unaccounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=564.272s">Now</a>  part of that unaccounted for water <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=566.817s">is</a>  the city-owned municipal buildings and the school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=570.858s">And</a>  according to Dominic Camara, the chairman of the Water and Sewer Commission, he believes about 10% of the unaccounted for water is through city-owned buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=582.042s">So</a>  that means that roughly about 10% is water that we're actually losing through old pipes, through leaks that are being undetected, and we're talking millions of dollars over a course of <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=595.876s">several</a>  years that the rate payers are paying for water that we're not using. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=601.02s">And</a>  this is a small amount to pay to add that peace of mind for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=608.066s">So</a>  you get a phone call saying, hey, possibly you have a leak or possibly we noticed there's a spike. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=614.951s">The</a>  system, the way I understand it, will kick out exception reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=620.956s">So</a>  it'll monitor your property for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=624.446s">And</a>  then over time, it's going to tell, well, your water spikes Thursday night at a particular time, and you may know a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=631.529s">I</a>  do my laundry every Thursday night, so I know there's a spike, and I know that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=635.71s">Or</a>  it'll tell you, we've noticed throughout the course of the week that there's been a spike over last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=643.053s">And</a>  then you know there's possibly a leak somewhere within your home if nothing's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=648.294s">So</a>  I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=651.556s">This</a>  is long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=653.293s">And</a>  I believe, as a council, we should be sending a message to the Water and Sewer Commission, as well as the administration, that we need this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=662.695s">And</a>  anything that we can do to save the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=666.336s">Water</a>  and sewer someday will be higher than your property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=670.277s">Anything</a>  we can do to save the ratepayers some money, I think the city is obligated to do so, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=679.179s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=681.0s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=682.122s">The</a>  unfortunate part about talking about this here tonight, there is really no need to talk about it because we have about $7.5 million in our water and sewer surplus enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=693.085s">That's</a>  what the money is used for, whether it's this program here that's $25,000 or the program that was originally offered at approximately $100,000 would have identified, as Council Member Marx just alluded to, every single house on a particular day, a particular night, a particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=708.777s">the</a>  individual person who was having that water loss would be identified. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=712.62s">Now,</a>  unfortunately, we have these new water meters, as we all know, for those of you that live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=717.383s">And</a>  if you're renters and rate payers, you'll understand that when they say that they have a policy not to give any abatements to someone who has a leak, that just doesn't sound right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=729.051s">Because</a>  why should they not give an abatement to someone who's having a leak through no fault of their own? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=734.515s">But</a>  is it through no fault of their own? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=735.775s">It's</a>  probably the city's fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=736.916s">They</a>  knew this was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=738.535s">They</a>  saw it coming, and they didn't do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=741.496s">I</a>  went to two meetings this past spring with the Water and Soil Commission to address this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=746.737s">But</a>  it has to have the support of the administration to spend this money to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=750.698s">And</a>  again, I thank my council colleague, Councilor Alango-Curran, for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=755.7s">And</a>  hopefully the council votes seven to nothing for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=758.34s">But</a>  it's the city administration that has to grant this issue of going forward to have this detection program in sight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=764.882s">So</a>  hopefully all of you who voted for it and supported <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=768.878s">It</a>  also is a beneficial asset to not only this community, but just saving water, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=774.5s">Whether</a>  it's 20% or whatever the amount is that's unaccounted for, you're paying for it one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=779.302s">And</a>  it's not coming out of every single home. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=781.003s">It's</a>  not even coming out of the homes that have these leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=783.884s">And</a>  the city in and of itself has its own leak problem beside the water that the city uses for its particular purposes for which you, the taxpayer, are being charged. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=792.668s">So</a>  I would like to have, just to bump this up one more degree, and not only support it, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=798.627s">But</a>  have a meeting, call for a meeting, Mr. President, with the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners for the purposes of going forward with this and any other proposal that might be necessary to finally resolve this problem once and for all.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=812.556s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Lago-Kern, as amended by Councilors Camuso and Penta, we have one more.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=823.122s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much, and I will be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=825.684s">I</a>  know we have a packed house tonight this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=829.066s">Councilor</a>  Lungo, I appreciate you putting this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=831.688s">I</a>  certainly think it's a good idea in theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=835.031s">I'm</a>  wondering if there are any other type of systems other than the Aquahawks system that might be out there, whether or not this is the best system for us to utilize, whether or not this is the one that we're going to get the most bang for our buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=845.841s">I</a>  also do question the fact it was $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=848.063s">Is</a>  that the correct figure, $25,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=849.084s">Less</a>  than $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=849.384s">Less</a>  than $25,000 per individual household. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=855.488s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=855.988s">It</a>  would be per individual household.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=858.23s">Citywide.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=858.57s">Citywide,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=860.632s">That</a>  changes things a little bit for me then. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=863.474s">I'm</a>  doing the math and I'm saying it's going to be quite an expensive endeavor if it's $25,000 per household in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=870.84s">Mr.</a>  President, with that being said, I have no problem supporting the endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=876.524s">You</a>  know, $25,000 for infrastructure, it seems like a drop in the bucket to me, especially with the rewards that we'll receive on the other end of the investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=884.617s">I</a>  wholeheartedly support it and move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=886.558s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=887.399s">So</a>  on that motion, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=889.56s">Just</a>  to further amend it, if we're going to ask for a meeting with the Water and Sewer Commission, is that we also invite the city engineer who may have some input as to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=896.563s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=897.103s">And</a>  to answer Councilor Knight's questions, the Aquahawk is recommended by the Water and Sewer Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=905.768s">But</a>  we can research and see if there's any systems out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=908.789s">It's</a>  just they've already done some major research and know what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=913.167s">said</a>  this would cost less than $25,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=914.668s">So</a>  I think we just need to move forward and start our discussion with regards to the full infrastructure detection system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=923.576s">But</a>  with regards to the residences, I can't bear to have another resident call me with regards to asking me to help them with an abatement when I know they will never get an abatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=935.766s">And</a>  it's a really sad situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=938.668s">I</a>  don't want it to happen to another family. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=940.89s">So</a>  if we can move on that portion, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=942.641s">more</a>  quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=944.022s">And</a>  I agree, we should be taking the money out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=947.425s">That's</a>  what the money's there for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=948.586s">There</a>  are millions of dollars in that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=950.927s">So</a>  I believe less than $25,000 would go a huge way to alleviating the problem.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=959.654s">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=960.395s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=962.056s">Roll</a>  call, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=963.898s">Roll</a>  call has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=966.4s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1061.016s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1063.717s">I've</a>  got three or four complaints with regards to the time Republic Parking is taking to respond to a request for appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1072.079s">And</a>  the last gentleman that I had spoken to, I've been dealing with him back and forth, and he finally let me know that on the 89th day, he got a response that his parking appeal was being denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1088.266s">That's,</a>  there must be some sort of writing that they have to respond within three months, yet they, I believe they told the city they'd be responding much faster than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1099.134s">So</a>  I just, it leaves people wondering, second guessing, calling, I'm sure calling Republic Parking over and over again to ask, you know, what's going on with their appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1108.701s">I</a>  have another one that was from July 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1111.363s">This</a>  woman is appealing and she still has not got a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1115.746s">So</a>  that's two months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1117.506s">I</a>  know this is, when one other person called Republic Parking, they said the person who deals with appeals is the one that's actually doing the ticketing, so maybe they don't have enough time to do these appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1131.377s">So</a>  I just feel that Republic Parking is not, the lack of response is really not a great way to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1141.245s">Obviously,</a>  we have issues with the parking program, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1144.013s">as</a>  it stands with regards to everything, but this is just one additional thing that has caught my attention within the last few weeks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1152.18s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1154.081s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1156.283s">Did</a>  you mention that the person that gave out the ticket is also responsible for doing the appeals?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1161.868s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1162.328s">The</a>  gentleman who said he got his response within 89 days said he called the office and they told him maybe the delay is the fact that the person giving the <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1173.387s">Handing</a>  out the tickets is the one that's supposed to handle the appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1178.49s">I</a>  think with regards to this response time, I know it's still in City Hall with regards to Diane McLeod as the actual hearing officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1186.475s">But</a>  to even get a response, this woman from July 20th hasn't even got an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1191.438s">She</a>  appealed it on the 25th of July, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1194.3s">She's</a>  got nothing in the mail, nothing, no phone call, nobody telling her when her hearing will be, when she should appear at City Hall, nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1203.441s">And</a>  this other gentleman got it on day 89, one day short of three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1208.523s">So</a>  I'm assuming it's 89 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1210.423s">I</a>  think that's unreasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1211.444s">I</a>  think it's ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1212.424s">I</a>  think it's just obviously the parking program is leaving a bad taste in people's mouths. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1217.546s">But</a>  everything you hear, it's just making it worse and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1222.568s">So</a>  I would just ask that Republic Parking, whether they need to hire somebody else or revamp their system of the way they're <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1230.157s">dealing</a>  with things, this is one of the many issues that needs to be addressed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1234.359s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1235.6s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1236.66s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1238.301s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Longo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1241.342s">She</a>  was lucky to get through on the telephone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1243.323s">I</a>  had made several phone calls, and I got started with the voicemail boxes all full. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1248.126s">And</a>  after like three hours of trying to get through, I actually drove down there to see somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1252.948s">And</a>  he was told that they're kind of short-staffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1256.01s">And</a>  I said, well, it's not really our problem that you can't do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1259.047s">I</a>  agree, 30 days is more than enough time to do an appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1263.808s">And</a>  anything after that, they should throw the appeal out and give the people their money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1269.929s">If</a>  they don't want to hire more people to work, the people who get tickets shouldn't have to suffer. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1276.131s">So</a>  I said I'd make a motion that we send it on to them that maximum time for an appeal is 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1281.872s">And</a>  if you can't respond within 30 days, then the ticket gets thrown out.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1328.978s">Number</a>  of appeals filed in number of outstanding appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1331.941s">Yes,</a>  sir Yes, and then it might make sense based upon some of the information that's been shared with us this evening to get an organization an organizational chart Mr. President as well, so we know who's in charge of what and who's doing what I'm making sure that the count the clerk has that amendment down correctly your point of information Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1354.64s">It's</a>  a necktie <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1355.586s">I</a>  don't think we need that for what you're asking, because we've been asking for a monthly report that would include that for what you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1362.608s">We've</a>  only got one monthly report so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1365.788s">So</a>  if you don't mind, can we just up it to say we'd like to have an up-to-date report on everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1370.45s">Tickets,</a>  citations, amount received, appeals pending, tickets that have been waived, and tickets that have been given up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1377.751s">Because</a>  that's what basically the report gave us before. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1381.04s">So</a>  rather than extrapolate it out of one or two issues, why don't we just ask for the complete report that we should be getting that we've asked for?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1387.402s">We</a>  can ask for that as well, but I'd like to see it in this format as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1390.943s">I'd</a>  like to take a look and see how long it takes from start to finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1393.244s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1393.484s">So</a>  when Councilor has the floor, he can make that amendment.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1396.525s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1397.846s">I</a>  understand where you're coming from, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1399.066s">I</a>  certainly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1400.207s">However,</a>  I'd like to see this data and this information for some personal analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1404.448s">But</a>  with that being said, I rest my case, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1407.569s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper as noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1410.531s">I</a>  would move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1411.832s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn as amended by Councilors Caraviello and Councilors, Councilor Knight, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1420.12s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1420.58s">And</a>  once again, I want to thank Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1424.704s">Um,</a>  I do think it's, it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1426.786s">The</a>  timeframe, uh, as Councilor Knight alluded to, if you don't pay the ticket within 28 days, they start adding on fees and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1434.8s">To</a>  not have at least a hearing and go through the due process within a reasonable period of time, it definitely is a major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1444.39s">I</a>  do know that this week, several people I've talked to, and I actually have one, I'll bring it next week, but received their decisions via email. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1453.495s">They're</a>  actually emailing the decisions to people to be environmentally friendly, or probably to save money, I'm sure, where it's the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1460.64s">But</a>  people did get their adjudication notices this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1465.885s">Some</a>  people did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1466.525s">I'm</a>  not sure when the appeals actually were made, but be interested to look at that data as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1474.451s">I</a>  think it's probably a good time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1476.268s">maybe</a>  in the month of October sometime to have a committee of the whole and just go over the whole program where it's ten months into inception and where we're at prior to getting to the winter months, find out what the plan is going to be to make sure that everything is shoveled out in a prudent manner before the first snowstorm comes and hits and then we're running around trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1499.182s">So</a>  I would like to <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1501.535s">I'd</a>  like to ask that this be amended to have a committee of the whole meeting, uh, towards the middle of my middle of October, possibly, um, or anytime in October, next week, whatever, to, um, to just go over the whole parking program where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1515.562s">And</a>  we can actually dig into all the reports that council and night just requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1519.944s">So</a>  I do support the, uh, Councilor wholeheartedly as well as the amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1525.046s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1525.427s">So</a>  as amended by council, Camuso council care of yellow,</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1529.604s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Noah. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1530.104s">I</a>  was going to ask for the same report that Councilor Pinter asked for, a full report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1533.968s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1534.688s">Does</a>  Councilor Pinter wish to ask for that report as an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1537.531s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1538.432s">So</a>  on the, uh, a report requested during his point of information, uh, now is asked as an amendment to the main motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1548.66s">So,</a>  uh, on all of that, the motion of, uh, Councilor Lungo-Koehn as amended by several of the councilors,</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1557.026s">Councilor</a>  Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1558.307s">Yes,</a>  I was able to track that back through my emails, actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1562.409s">It</a>  was a violation that was issued MDC 5482. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1565.09s">It</a>  was issued on 8-15-2015 at 5-16 in the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1571.233s">So</a>  that was turned around within a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1573.674s">So</a>  there may be something going on with the specific ones in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1578.016s">But</a>  the notice that someone sent to me saying that the adjudication and stuff took place, that is the date that the violation was issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1586.182s">on</a>  the ticket in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1589.283s">So</a>  I'm starting to think maybe that's one person that's not doing their job possibly, but we have to investigate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1597.186s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1597.906s">We</a>  need that report and we certainly need that committee meeting.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1601.127s">So</a>  on the motion, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1603.728s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1604.728s">I</a>  thought Councilor Knight brought up a great idea regarding the staffing tree, because if you have staff that's responsible for giving out tickets, which in my opinion is a full-time position, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1616.423s">and</a>  then also responsible for sending out the hearing notices, which is also a full-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1622.107s">I'd</a>  like to see what the current staffing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1624.628s">I</a>  think that's a very worthy request and also see what the hierarchy is within this particular organization.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1633.034s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1633.774s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Marks, we now invite the members of the public who are patiently waiting to address the council regarding this particular motion, which is before us, we ask that you <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1645.761s">State</a>  your name and address for the record before you speak.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1649.703s">Welcome.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1650.843s">Hi,</a>  my name's Chris Capri. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1652.604s">I'm</a>  at 10 Salem Street, Chris Capri Salon. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1657.025s">Well,</a>  as you know, I'm here on the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1660.887s">You</a>  have to make some amendments on this parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1664.769s">They're</a>  not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1666.749s">I</a>  have more frustrated people coming in the salon and they were all anxious because they were afraid they're going to get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1674.479s">Now,</a>  one of the clients last Saturday, she got two tickets on her car. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1679.841s">I</a>  mean, how many tickets do you give for one car? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1683.963s">I</a>  don't understand it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1685.043s">No</a>  one understands the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1687.344s">They</a>  have no idea what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1689.585s">I</a>  see them outside fiddling and trying to get the meters to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1694.187s">One</a>  of my clients comes from puberty every week, and every week she has the same problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1699.609s">It</a>  won't take her money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1702.232s">I</a>  mean, there's got to be some adjustments made and who's going to make them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1706.395s">That's</a>  what I want to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1708.597s">People</a>  need more education on it because we don't know what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1712.66s">And</a>  two hours is not enough when you have a salon, especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1718.744s">Or</a>  even if you're going out to dinner, you got to worry about running out and moving, physically moving your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1725.069s">Why</a>  do we have to move our car? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1727.391s">Isn't</a>  everything about money? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1730.72s">What's</a>  the difference whose car is parked there so long as they're getting paid for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1735.263s">I</a>  don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1737.725s">What</a>  can we do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1740.687s">I</a>  mean, is there a way out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1746.491s">That's</a>  my question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1747.332s">Is</a>  there a way out of this?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1748.913s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1750.094s">Chris,</a>  you've been up before the Councilor a number of times on this very same issue, and I think we've had a lot of back and forth and discussion about what options are available to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1759.542s">have</a>  you gone to the traffic commission and all as we've suggested in the past and have brought up any of these concerns with the traffic commission is responsible for setting traffic policy here in medford no no because i really don't know who to talk to traffic commission will probably be a place to start i think we might have brought that up a couple of other times at other meetings um but i can certainly understand your frustration i think that you know in looking at <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1782.625s">how</a>  we're going to approach the META system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1784.906s">The</a>  program was rolled out bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1785.986s">There's</a>  no question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1787.227s">But</a>  the program definitely needs to be tweaked. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1789.227s">There's</a>  no question about that, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1790.928s">And</a>  we've had some successes in that regard. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1793.669s">My</a>  question is, I guess we have several resolutions right now that are pending before the Traffic Commission that we haven't gotten responses to, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1799.211s">So</a>  I'd like to ask that we remind the Traffic Commission that we have a couple of outstanding resolutions that need some responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1805.554s">I'd</a>  ask the city clerk to add that as part of the paper.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1809.867s">So</a>  on the main motion by Vice President Longo-Curran, further amended by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1815.31s">But</a>  I mean, the Traffic Commission sets the traffic policy in the City of Metro, not the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1818.852s">So,</a>  you know, the only way that we can effectuate change is by asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1823.154s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1823.414s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1824.754s">Jim</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1826.715s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1828.096s">Hi,</a>  Jim. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1828.456s">Good</a>  evening, everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1830.817s">And</a>  again, we have to talk about the parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1836.06s">This</a>  is very, very <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1838.602s">Very</a>  bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1839.362s">You</a>  know, business very awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1843.804s">You</a>  got to do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1846.685s">A</a>  lot of customers, they said, Jimmy, we go to Winchester, we go Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1852.206s">And</a>  again, I appreciate a lot of customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1854.307s">They</a>  walk, they don't come with the cars no more from places that are up Madison, Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1861.829s">Sometimes</a>  I feel bad because I've got two pitches to carry over to Madison Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1865.631s">I</a>  say, you want to give your right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1868.356s">So</a>  what am I going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1869.016s">I</a>  try to do business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1870.297s">I</a>  said, Jimmy, I can't park. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1873.679s">We</a>  lost the lands about 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1877.841s">Used</a>  to people read the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1879.922s">You</a>  know, they sit in for 20 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1882.743s">Not</a>  anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1884.024s">I</a>  forgot my phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1885.044s">I</a>  got pictures every day to see the whole part, you know, the front empty. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1895.129s">I</a>  can bring my phone to give a proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1897.91s">Every</a>  day, no cars at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1900.292s">I</a>  don't think the meter they makes about $10, $15 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1903.814s">I</a>  don't think what kind of money the city's going to make with these meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1908.077s">And</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1909.358s">I've</a>  got a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1910.139s">If</a>  you can put it, the old time meters, I don't think anybody with a quarter, I think, works better off. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1920.426s">The</a>  old meters? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1921.367s">The</a>  old meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1923.188s">These</a>  don't work at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1927.285s">A</a>  lot of complaints every day, every day, every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1933.187s">We</a>  got to take this serious because I think another six months, there are going to be any business in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1941.47s">There</a>  are going to be any cities and any business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1945.471s">And</a>  again, you know, the last quarter, I tried to make my taxes because I got a large bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1950.833s">You</a>  know, I own the building also besides the gyms, pizza. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1955.58s">And</a>  I was late to pay my tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1957.461s">They</a>  put $222. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1960.102s">I</a>  got to pay, you know, penalty interest because I'm late. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1965.625s">Sometimes</a>  my tenant, they bring the payment late. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1969.527s">I</a>  got a tenant, they don't pay me water for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1973.289s">What</a>  am I going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1974.91s">And</a>  I say, get out, and then I got to take forever to rent my spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1983.054s">It's</a>  very serious, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1985.965s">We</a>  got to do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1989.307s">It's</a>  no business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1991.868s">Mr.</a>  Pender.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1993.149s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1993.969s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1994.409s">Yes,</a>  Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1995.43s">Just</a>  to answer, I think they're looking for us for a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=1998.992s">And</a>  I think, just want to let you know, we've taken some serious votes with regards to the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2004.134s">It's</a>  gone to, like Councilor Knight said, to the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2007.676s">And</a>  we're trying to get the mayor to listen to us with regards to, we've talked about eliminating it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2014.392s">serious</a>  changes that need to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2015.953s">I</a>  know the traffic commission has made some changes, but we've requested 30 minutes free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2021.756s">We've</a>  asked them to discuss an hour of free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2025.058s">We've</a>  asked them to eliminate the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2027.139s">We're</a>  just waiting for a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2029.18s">Hopefully</a>  come January 1st, there's either some major tweaking or another system is put in place to create the turnover but not create this situation that we're in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2043.192s">complete.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2044.273s">It's</a>  no changes or half an hour, two hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2047.316s">They're</a>  not going to work for this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2050.92s">It's</a>  a lot of people in West Medford especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2055.225s">All</a>  local people, they come go to the bank, they come to me, they go next to Arthur's Bakery or the tailor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2063.553s">They</a>  don't have the people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2064.595s">They</a>  park all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2066.924s">They</a>  happens maybe in 15 years, two times. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2070.286s">I</a>  see a car for six, seven hours, and then I call the police and say, what's going on, seven hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2076.008s">And</a>  we don't have any problems.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2079.45s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2081.931s">Madam</a>  Vice President, you're all set?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2083.452s">Yes,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2084.232s">Councilor</a>  Camuso has the floor next.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2086.773s">I</a>  just wanted to let the residents know the city of Arlington put out a press release last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2093.356s">They're</a>  going parking kiosks and meters, the entire <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2097.032s">City,</a>  Massachusetts Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2098.873s">Right</a>  now they're in the parking lots and they're actually putting them out on Massachusetts Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2101.995s">They're</a>  rolling it out according to the city manager in Arlington. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2106.559s">So,</a>  just as a point of information.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2110.121s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2110.641s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2112.143s">This</a>  is the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2113.143s">This</a>  isn't Arlington, Belmont, Winchester, or any other town. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2115.725s">This</a>  is the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2117.326s">And</a>  I want to go back to February 3rd of this past year, February 3rd of 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2120.508s">Councilor</a>  Marks asked a very important question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2124.937s">Because</a>  one of the problems that we were having over here was that people would get out of their car, go to the kiosk, put their money in, and by the time they came back, they were getting a ticket because these bounty hunters were there ready to land on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2137.784s">Well,</a>  this past weekend, I observed two particular situations in the far end parking lot here in Nutford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2143.927s">And</a>  they were both two, one a woman with a child, another one was an elderly lady. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2148.69s">Both</a>  of them were coming out of wherever they were, respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2151.511s">They</a>  had their tickets in their hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2152.792s">They</a>  were walking toward their cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2154.702s">Those</a>  trucks were waiting right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2156.543s">One</a>  woman was within one minute of having that thing expired or she would have got a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2161.386s">And</a>  the other woman was two minutes, one minute and two minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2164.508s">And</a>  they were right there, ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2167.07s">Council</a>  Marks asked the traffic commission to give a 15 minute leeway before and after for someone who would park their car, just as just one of the issues to park their car to go to and from. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2179.177s">Now,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2179.798s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense at all, because these folks are out of town. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2182.58s">They</a>  don't even come from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2183.961s">They</a>  don't even come from Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2185.762s">They're</a>  only here for one thing, is to make money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2188.544s">And</a>  to me, it's anti-business, and it's anti-consumer for the citizens of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2192.927s">People</a>  keep saying, other cities and towns do this and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2196.51s">It's</a>  good to look and see what other cities and towns do, because you can probably land. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2200.633s">But</a>  Medford has to be unique unto itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2202.834s">It</a>  has to be its own person, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2205.776s">And</a>  if we've had it this way for a long period of time, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2208.593s">Maybe</a>  what we really need to do is to go back and look at the 2009 report for which this mayor commissioned and asked them to report back and for which this mayor did not heed their advice, which was very simple, to have a traffic enforcement plan with proper signage and enforcement and see where that took you on a very small scale, slowly but surely. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2229.17s">We</a>  went from A to Z overnight just like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2231.772s">And</a>  of course, it's in the dead of winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2234.033s">But</a>  forget the winter because it's come and gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2236.245s">You've</a>  had all your summer months, and now you're getting into the early fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2240.028s">It</a>  just isn't getting better. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2241.41s">They're</a>  just pounding away these people. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2243.652s">And</a>  when you think of a business such as this that makes tremendous, they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars, and they operate from 8 in the morning to 6 o'clock at night, and they're not open on Saturday, which is a legitimate business day in the business world of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2257.384s">And</a>  the folks in this community that have to have an appeal <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2259.799s">As</a>  Councilor Lungo just alluded to, they can't even go, because if they're working from Monday through Friday, their appeal process should be able to be taken care of on a Saturday, at least within a month's period of time at maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2271.563s">You</a>  do have options. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2272.703s">Your</a>  options can be a buyout. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2274.284s">Your</a>  options can be to change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2276.004s">But</a>  you can't even consider the idea of tweaking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2279.005s">Some</a>  people want to say, well, we're going to give it out to all our seniors for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2283.007s">Now,</a>  if I was Republican and I was looking at that comment, I'd say, wait a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2286.718s">It's</a>  bad enough you took my 7 to 7 away, you now brought me down 8 to 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2290.481s">That's</a>  12 hours a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2292.203s">That's</a>  48 hours a month you're taking away from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2294.445s">That's</a>  profit in my pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2296.026s">That's</a>  not what the contract says. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2297.947s">And</a>  even though the city solicitor says that the city of Medford has the right to change the time, and they also have the right to change the rates, I don't think that would fly in the contract because if you read the contract, it's quite specific as it relates to what you can and cannot do.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2314.794s">One</a>  week, we want to get out of the contract because it's broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2318.176s">This</a>  week, there's maybe recommendations to do stuff that was well within our right, like giving senior citizens passes where they're exempted. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2328.862s">Let's</a>  make up our mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2330.423s">Are</a>  we either going to follow the contract or do within our right of the contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2334.826s">I</a>  wholeheartedly support giving senior citizens free parking privileges in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2339.969s">These</a>  people no longer have children in the public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2342.723s">These</a>  children, the senior citizens of our community, have made Medford great the way it is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2349.027s">So</a>  to sit here and go against something that's positive and say that the company, the company, the company, I just feel that I think we have to do what's right by the residents and the city of Medford, not the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2361.814s">I'm</a>  not worried about the company.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2366.717s">I</a>  find it ironic a month before a major election that <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2371.788s">Candidates</a>  now want to give senior citizens free parking on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2376.572s">But</a>  a year and a half ago, when they created this program, there was never any mention about that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2381.595s">So</a>  I find that ironic now, all of a sudden, people want to give out free parking everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2386.379s">And</a>  if we want to give out free parking, why did the mayor litter our streets with kiosk? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2391.943s">So</a>  I'm not quite sure if that argument holds any credibility.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2399.935s">What</a>  we're talking about here is a system that's broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2403.277s">It</a>  doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2404.918s">We're</a>  talking about a system that has caused so much anxiety to business folks and to consumers and to our own residents here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2412.802s">And</a>  the fact of the matter is there was no public meetings on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2416.243s">There</a>  was no public hearings on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2418.404s">Last</a>  year in October, the city of Medford city council asked on three separate times through resolutions to have these types of meeting with the downtown business areas and to have the chamber included and to have the residents included. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2429.747s">And</a>  the mayor ignored all of those requests, only to sign the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2434.009s">And</a>  what you have is what you've got right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2436.15s">A</a>  complete debacle of an operation that has absolutely and serves no purpose here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2444.554s">Just</a>  think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2445.194s">I'll</a>  leave you with this last thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2446.815s">We're</a>  all talking about the problems, and we're going to sit down and have another meeting, another meeting, and another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2451.697s">This</a>  has been going on for well over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2453.839s">And</a>  because there was no transparency to this whole operation, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2457.223s">And</a>  because there was no communication back and forth, and because there was no thought process as it relates to what possibly could happen, what can't we do, what should we do, that in and of itself has got to tell you, you can't keep talking about changing a program knowing it doesn't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2473.886s">If</a>  it doesn't work, you do one of two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2476.566s">You</a>  get rid of it, and you start all over again, slowly but surely you have a sense of transparency, and that's the way it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2483.107s">So</a>  the people of this community who are paying for it understand what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2488.29s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2491.711s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2493.531s">Councilor</a>  Camuso talked about how Arlington is doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2496.252s">What</a>  they're doing is they have purchased meters that give you 15 minutes of free time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2500.913s">When</a>  you pull up to the spot, you hit the button, and you get 15 minutes of free time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2506.114s">And</a>  they're going with the meter heads in. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2509.115s">Again,</a>  maybe it's something that our city looks into going forward as part of the adjustment period.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2516.077s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2517.057s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2518.918s">Also,</a>  it's my understanding in talking to the mayor, meters are going to be starting to pop up, the regular old-fashioned meters that Medford Square had back in the 80s within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2532.71s">So</a>  there's going to be the regular standalone meters that Chris alluded to, where you just throw the quarter in, and those are going to be starting to get sprinkled around the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2544.339s">The</a>  elephant in the room here is twofold as far as I'm concerned with the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2548.564s">to</a>  just get out of this pocket, and it's going to cost us, as of today, $1.1 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2551.665s">$1.1</a>  million to get out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2553.086s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2559.969s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2561.95s">I'm</a>  glad that Councilor Camuso had a conversation with the mayor about now we're going to see meters throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2568.593s">Yet</a>  again, another item that the mayor never involved the business community, never involved this council, never had a public hearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2577.263s">And</a>  that's the reason why we're in the predicament we're in now, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2580.465s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may, um, the evening that the business owners were at our meeting, when this council voted seven to nothing to send out the, um, to negotiate with Republic parking, it was a seven to nothing vote of the Medford city council that evening and included in that was kiosks and meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2599.715s">clearly</a>  in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2600.595s">There</a>  was businesses throughout the community that came up that evening and made mention that they would like to have regular meters in front of their stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2607.458s">I</a>  know several in West Medford, several in Medford Square have approached the city, would be interested in having the quarter meters in front of their business because it's the type of business where you're just running in in one quarter and rather than going to the kiosk. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2620.763s">So</a>  with that being said, like I said a few minutes ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2625.112s">To</a>  get out of it and wipe this out totally, it's $1.1 million as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2630.794s">$300,000</a>  in estimated receipts.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2634.115s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Pantone. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2636.035s">That</a>  is absolutely not true, Mr. President, because the total cost of the program to put this in operation was less than a million dollars, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2642.717s">Number</a>  two, they've already taken over $440,000 in net profit from the last report that we got, and the city of Mifflin only got 32%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2649.439s">So</a>  if they got $442,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2652.197s">We</a>  got less than $200,000 out of that so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2655.418s">There</a>  are trade-offs in this particular contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2657.839s">There</a>  have been violations in this contract by both sides, by Republic as well as the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2663.001s">And</a>  the City of Medford has been equally negligent in not going forward either through the traffic commission or through resolutions of this council as it relates to the agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2671.584s">And</a>  lastly, and most importantly, all this Medford City Council ever did was to allow the mayor to go out and to negotiate with Republic <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2678.913s">up</a>  to a 10-year contract, but at the same time to come back to the council and show us if the city of Medford was going to do it and what the cost factor would be before anything was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2689.423s">The</a>  mayor never did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2690.384s">He</a>  went ahead and signed the contract <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2691.968s">without</a>  coming back to the Medford City Council and explaining both in detail.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2698.993s">Unfortunately,</a>  I think the council is confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2701.696s">There's</a>  $300,000 that was in our fiscal year budget that we're operating right now, estimated receipts from this parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2709.522s">So</a>  you take the $800,000 that's amortized for the actual equipment plus the $300,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2715.508s">that</a>  is in estimated receipts, minus a quarter of the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2719.429s">So</a>  rather than 1.1 million, it's probably around 1 million, say, to buy it outright right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2726.39s">To</a>  say that the city council did not support it, we supported it on two occasions, seven to nothing vote, seven to nothing vote, loud and clear, it has to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2735.372s">The</a>  mayor did have a thing with that, that it came back to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2739.833s">We</a>  met in this council office over here, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2743.119s">before</a>  the mayor signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2744.38s">I</a>  don't know the exact date, but we met in that council office. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2747.583s">Some</a>  of the people that are in the room this evening were at that meeting as well as a lot of other businesses throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2754.309s">The</a>  place was jammed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2755.651s">It</a>  was packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2756.211s">We</a>  were actually going to move the meeting into the council chamber, but we couldn't because there was another meeting going on in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2761.436s">So,</a>  uh, it was a seven to nothing vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2763.518s">It's</a>  seven to nothing vote.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2766.825s">point</a>  of information, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2769.326s">May</a>  20th of 2014, Council Resolution 14472 offered by, before the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2774.888s">Yes,</a>  the Medford City Council did agree to allow the Mayor to go forward, but also conditioned upon the fact that he would present himself back, present himself back with an in-house review as to what the cost would be on September 10th of 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2789.614s">We</a>  had a Committee of the Whole meeting over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2791.685s">And</a>  the reason why the Committee of the Whole meeting took place was, again, to explain that for which took place between May 20th up to September 14th, September 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2800.768s">At</a>  that meeting, there was 30 to 40 business people at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2804.149s">And</a>  there was a pushback by the mayor because he didn't expect those people to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2808.271s">On</a>  October 10th, approximately one month later, the mayor came back and signed the contract without getting a vote of approval by the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2817.094s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2817.514s">Those</a>  are the records of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2818.894s">Mr.</a>  Chair.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2819.234s">Mr.</a>  President, Councilor Cusack. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2821.678s">Like</a>  I said, the records of the Medford City Council don't lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2824.239s">It</a>  was a seven to nothing vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2825.759s">People</a>  can pretend they didn't vote for it, did vote for it, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2828.3s">I'm</a>  not gonna argue any more about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2829.581s">It</a>  was seven to zip. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2830.961s">Anyone</a>  can go down to the city clerk's office, see the minutes of that particular meeting in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2835.563s">It</a>  was seven to nothing vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2837.403s">It</a>  only needed five votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2839.804s">I</a>  believe it might have needed five or four. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2842.345s">I'm</a>  not really sure because it was for up to 10 year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2845.946s">Seven</a>  years up front, three years in the rear if the city decides to <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2851.794s">renegotiate</a>  up to three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2853.955s">So</a>  it was a seven to nothing vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2856.076s">And</a>  he mentioned the council resolution numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2858.198s">Anyone</a>  out there that's watching can go down to the city clerk's office and see the vote of the council was unanimous. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2863.721s">So,</a>  uh, that's a really, you can't, you can't beat the dead horse anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2868.644s">It</a>  was a seven to nothing vote of the Medford city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2871.445s">It</a>  was actually one of the few times that we're actually all unanimous behind this rail. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2876.988s">As</a>  we know, we often vote, um, our separate ways and, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2880.192s">That</a>  was one that everyone supported.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2882.834s">So</a>  we have a motion on the floor that has been amended several times and we're now going to hear from a couple more citizens who wish to speak on this and that we're going to put this to a vote, move on to the next agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2897.647s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2899.709s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2900.769s">My</a>  name is Michael Orgero. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2902.031s">I</a>  live on 18 Pembroke street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2904.427s">The</a>  first thing I want to address is a point that Councilor Knight brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2909.091s">Many</a>  business owners are not able to attend the Traffic Commission meeting because it's during the day, and they are running their businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2916.716s">I've</a>  had an informal poll. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2918.277s">I've</a>  had an opportunity to discuss the issue with a variety of different businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2922.421s">I</a>  have many on tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2924.942s">About</a>  80% of the businesses in Medford believe that the parking meters have hurt their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2931.407s">That's</a>  a fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2932.983s">About</a>  10% say it hasn't really hurt, hasn't really helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2936.546s">The</a>  10% that actually think it's helped their business would have preferred a system of just enforcing what we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2942.751s">So</a>  that's the first point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2944.092s">The</a>  hours of the traffic commission are not convenient for Jimmy's pizza. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2947.495s">He's</a>  making pizza.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2949.837s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2951.418s">If</a>  I was losing 35% of my business, like Mr. Spiracus mentioned, I'd make time to go to the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2956.603s">This</a>  is my livelihood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2957.443s">This</a>  is the way that we provide to put food at our table for our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2960.81s">If</a>  this is having this dramatic of an effect, you better believe I'm making the time to go down there and talk to the traffic commission or anybody else that's in charge of making these policy decisions that are going to affect my life in that fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2970.117s">So</a>  while the gentleman may feel as though the traffic commission structure and the times that they meet aren't necessarily convenient to him, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2977.395s">That's</a>  a mechanism of the traffic commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2979.256s">And</a>  I'm sure, I am sure that with a little outreach and a little communication with the traffic commission, they'll be willing to change that to maybe meet off hours, to maybe meet once a month, uh, late at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2988.579s">Um,</a>  but you gotta ask the question, Mr. President, right now they meet at two o'clock once a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2992.54s">I'm</a>  sure if we make the recommendation or we make a request, they will do that at a different, different times and different hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=2997.182s">But</a>  keep in mind, if I was losing 35% a month in my business, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3001.998s">I'd</a>  be the first one down at the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3003.719s">I</a>  think I'd be able to afford to close the doors if, in fact, my business was being affected 35% negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3009.103s">To</a>  go down there and to talk to them.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3015.668s">I</a>  rest my point, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3016.729s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3018.07s">Please</a>  don't interrupt.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3019.371s">With</a>  all due respect to the Councilor, the fact that 80% of the businesses in Medford are losing business should be his concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3026.652s">And</a>  he can make an easy recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3028.312s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3030.013s">An</a>  informal poll from a gentleman that walked around and knocked on doors isn't statistical analysis.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3034.754s">Point</a>  of information as well.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3036.334s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3038.535s">Based</a>  upon the reports that we got from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue as well, as recent as a couple of months ago, the sales and meals tax has jumped dramatically from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3051.177s">So</a>  unless the price of meals is double or whatever is going on, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3055.658s">That's</a>  actual statistical data from the Department of Revenue.</p>

    <p>[Michael Ruggiero]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3060.762s">Beyond</a>  these two points, in this perhaps squabbling environment, going to these traffic, listening to this conversation about traffic over and over again, I'm reminded about those cartoons with Wile E. Coyote. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3073.171s">where</a>  you have the coyote chasing roadrunner and the background keeps changing, but everyone really knows there's no movement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3080.133s">It's</a>  just the background keeps swinging around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3082.974s">Ultimately,</a>  this problem boils down to the way that we have written our charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3088.256s">We</a>  need to review our charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3090.777s">Currently,</a>  my team is circulating the petition to actually have the charter reviewed, so mysterious contracts cannot be signed in the middle of night without prior approval of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3100.82s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3111.25s">Please</a>  state your name and address for the record, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3113.511s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3114.491s">Hi,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3115.591s">I'm</a>  Jim Bilodeau, Guild Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3118.092s">I'd</a>  just like to say something about the parking field program.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3131.995s">I</a>  just want to say something about the field parking, Republic parking program from Tennessee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3139.392s">people</a>  getting tickets before operating hours and after operating hours, and on holidays, and also people with handicapped parking permits also getting tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3151.021s">Businesses</a>  is way down wherever the kiosks are, and sometimes using your charge card does not record correctly, and you get a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3162.309s">From</a>  the Republic, money thieves. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3165.391s">We</a>  need an in-house Medford fare parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3170.558s">Also,</a>  I would like, like noted in the Medford transcript newspaper on Thursday, July 23rd, McGovern's handpicked candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3181.561s">She</a>  stated that we have no right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3184.101s">Listen</a>  to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3184.661s">You're</a>  going to look at the paper and it's proof on the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3188.602s">She</a>  states, we have no right to be here in the city council meeting and talking about the field kiosk parking program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3196.88s">if</a>  you are not licensed to practice law in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3202.284s">It's</a>  in the paper, and she stated that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3204.706s">It's</a>  on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3206.047s">I</a>  just want to say that this is the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3210.07s">We</a>  have a constitutional right to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3212.992s">This</a>  is a democracy, and we have freedom of speech.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3217.216s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3218.216s">Thank</a>  you all.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3224.221s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chimney. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3225.77s">I</a>  want to disagree with Mr. Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3228.772s">I</a>  know for a long, long time, and said he was to school across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3235.378s">And</a>  revenues, I don't think they've gone up in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3240.461s">No,</a>  I don't believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3242.343s">And</a>  I'd like to see an increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3244.465s">I</a>  know fact, and I know I spoke about nine people, businessmen, in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3250.249s">The</a>  business was about 18 to 22 percent down this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3256.912s">And</a>  I have, you know, my son Costa, he's got a friend in Winchester, Arlington, Gooben, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3265.697s">The</a>  sales, they're going up 8, 9% in Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3267.278s">I</a>  drive last week 130. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3273.99s">It</a>  was like a bazaar in downtown Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3278.132s">People</a>  in and out of the stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3279.893s">I</a>  parked for 10 minutes, and I look around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3282.475s">And</a>  then I come back to West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3284.076s">It</a>  was dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3285.036s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3285.577s">Only</a>  I see three cars on the ice cream place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3288.458s">Nobody</a>  else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3290.419s">Nobody</a>  else. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3292.421s">No</a>  businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3294.402s">I</a>  go, Mr. Covington, to pick up vegetables, Roberto's place. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3299.325s">He</a>  says to me, Jimmy, how's business? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3301.286s">Three</a>  days ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3302.667s">I</a>  says, terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3303.813s">It's</a>  just — I don't know if I'm going to make it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3306.095s">You</a>  know, new owners bought it from, I don't know, a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3312.099s">It's</a>  just — it's scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3314.9s">Business</a>  very often. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3318.503s">And</a>  I don't think the revenue is going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3321.645s">And,</a>  again, you have to look very serious, because another year, I don't know, this city, what's going to happen.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3328.109s">The</a>  Press Jimmy, just so you know, the number I'm basing it off of is the revenue that <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3333.164s">The</a>  city of Medford gets back from the Department of Revenue based upon the sales of male's tax.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3338.527s">That's</a>  the number that went up significantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3340.067s">I'm</a>  going to get you the numbers.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3500.999s">I'm</a>  looking at the underlying petition here, and what the petitioner <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3505.22s">has</a>  written down versus what's shown up in the agenda are two very different items, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3511.923s">And</a>  I think that this is something that should be handled a little bit more sensitively than we are at this point in time, based upon what I'm seeing here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3521.688s">It's</a>  my understanding that in certain instances, if a person's reputation is on the line, that that individual does have the right to appear before the council, or they also have the option to meet with an executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3533.49s">to</a>  determine whether or not it's appropriate for the public forum, I think we might need to have an opinion from our city solicitor before we go any further, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3541.434s">It's</a>  very troubling what I'm reading here on the petition signed September 11th, 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3545.937s">A</a>  very delicate concern that we have about the way a certain individual that's a member of the Chevalier Commission is treating us at the Chevalier Theater just because we are not white people and we are from a different religion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3558.678s">I</a>  think that that alone, Mr. President, would warrant us to at least err on the side of caution and allow the city solicitor to give us an opinion as to whether or not this is an appropriate matter for executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3568.441s">We</a>  have a city employee who's been named by name in a derogatory fashion, and I feel as though if this goes any further, it may be damaging to his reputation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3576.843s">And</a>  I also feel as though he should have the right to at least get an opinion from council as to whether or not the appropriate forum to hear this would be here or an executive session, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3585.967s">So</a>  in light of that point of order, Councilor, do you have a motion for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3590.93s">My</a>  motion would be to lay the matter on the table until we can receive an opinion from the solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3594.752s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight to lay this matter on the table, pending a opinion from the city solicitor, a motion to table a matter is unavailable. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3606.938s">So</a>  this motion on the motion of Councilor Knight to table, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3612.603s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3614.283s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3615.764s">The</a>  matter is now tabled and the city council will seek recommendations from the city solicitor on how to proceed on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3628.887s">The</a>  mayor already read what delicate condition has been placed in the petition that could be regarded as a serious charge against someone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3638.509s">The</a>  mayor read that and he met with me and John Costas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3643.403s">We</a>  already had a meeting with the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3645.985s">The</a>  matter is tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3647.246s">We</a>  can no longer discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3654.011s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn to revert back to the regular order business.</p>

    <p>[Cindy Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3663.137s">Councilor</a>  Knights comments that this has not been issued with level of sensitivity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3668.421s">I</a>  was here two years ago.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3671.112s">We</a>  have this, I'm afraid this matter is tabled, so it's been placed on the table and the rules of the council would prohibit us from continuing this discussion as the matter is tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3682.679s">My</a>  sincerest apologies.</p>

    <p>[Cindy Watson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3687.362s">Well,</a>  it's a sad commentary on the way this is being handled because it's been two years now and sensitivity is really an ironic word for you to use, Adam, because</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3700.631s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3706.714s">My</a>  concern is nothing more than a city employee.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3708.935s">The</a>  motion has been tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3711.296s">The</a>  motion has been tabled. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3712.696s">That's</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3713.677s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Longo, turn to return to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3719.939s">All</a>  those in favor.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3720.96s">Mr.</a>  President, while we're in the suspension, I just have one announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3723.441s">Is</a>  that good? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3724.901s">Councilor</a>  Knight, by remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3727.253s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3729.395s">I</a>  just want to commend and congratulate Patrick Coughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3733.338s">He</a>  is a local resident here, and he just graduated from boot camp for the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3739.742s">Marines</a>  on September 4th in Parris Island in South Carolina. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3744.246s">And</a>  Patrick has made his mother and father very proud and has served this community very proud, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3753.353s">And</a>  I want to wish him well on all his future endeavors.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3828.366s">Mr.</a>  President, this resolution is brought forward because, as we all know, as you traverse through Medford Square and as of some point in time during this late summer, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3838.523s">We've</a>  seen construction taking place here in Renfrew Square as it relates to the Craddock Bridge or the refurbishing of the Craddock Bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3846.205s">Now,</a>  we know it's a 121-foot bridge, and we know that we've been told it's going to take approximately two and a half years to get itself refurbished. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3853.406s">The</a>  unfortunate part of the two and a half years is that this is not an everyday, six-day-a-week project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3858.547s">In</a>  any one given week, you may be working two days, three days, four days, for whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3863.668s">And</a>  unfortunately, in the contract, there's nothing that demands that they have to be there on a daily basis <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3868.536s">six</a>  days a week, working double time, as the contract said it would. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3872.297s">Number</a>  two, we see there is an ongoing traffic congestion and a traffic public safety problem with the buses that are now stopping on Main Street in downtown Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3883.761s">And</a>  since, in fact, there has to be some changes, because the sidewalks are going to be getting dug up, the street is going to have to be refurbished over there on the odd side of the street, something has to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3895.724s">And</a>  what's going to have to give is the public buses, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3898.699s">that</a>  traverse over there because there is no way that they can make a reasonable public safety stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3904.243s">My</a>  recommendation would be, since the city council is the only one that can move to change or recommend to change bus stops, is to put those buses all on Medford Square that would stop there, change the direction of River Street instead of coming down and have it go left so it takes you right back to Salem Street and then it goes around. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3921.548s">I've</a>  spoken with many senior citizens from 121 and 99. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3924.849s">There</a>  is no way that they want to walk down that new ring road, cross under the bridge, to go to the bus stop if it's going to be moved over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3932.69s">That</a>  walk, especially in the winter, especially if the inclement weather, snow or raining, it would just put them right out of business, physically, so to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3941.652s">So</a>  by putting those buses in Main Street, instead of coming and taking the ride on Main Street like they do, all they would do would be just going into Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3949.827s">They</a>  would be going to River Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3951.308s">You'd</a>  be opening up the parking spaces on the right-hand side, on the Dainty Donut side, and you would just probably add maybe another three to four minutes on a bus route, but so be it, because something's going to have to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3963.377s">So</a>  to make sure that everybody's on board with this so there's an understanding, Mr. President, I'm going to recommend that we have a committee of the whole so we have a sense of transparency and openness as it relates to not only this particular issue, to let's look at all the ideas that need to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3976.898s">That</a>  would be my recommendation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3978.499s">And</a>  that's what's speaking from business owners and from people who traverse those bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3982.382s">But</a>  again, this needs to be done sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3984.503s">So</a>  I'm going to ask you, Mr. President, within the next two weeks to call for a Committee of the Whole meeting and to also call someone from the Department of Transportation, also someone from the MBTA, as well as our own Office of Community Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3996.651s">And</a>  I welcome that, and it's important.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=3998.613s">But</a>  can I, just by way of reminder, point out to you that the biggest obstacle we had when we addressed this the last time <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4006.788s">was</a>  our friends from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, who we give an awful lot of money every year.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4013.714s">I</a>  think we're either the third or the fourth highest user within its system. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4017.857s">And</a>  this is one time, if you remember correctly, because I do, because I have my notes, the last time we had this meeting, there was one lady who allegedly stated that she was the only one that was in charge of reviewing these bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4028.286s">They</a>  don't make the decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4029.787s">The</a>  Medford City Council makes the decision on bus stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4033.05s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4035.825s">without</a>  being repetitious, and they won't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4037.927s">And</a>  the other sad part about this whole thing, it's already impacting businesses in the downtown Medford Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4043.732s">Now,</a>  we've been told that there was no mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4045.714s">Mitigation</a>  is not an available item. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4047.275s">And</a>  that's absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4049.076s">Because</a>  if this bridge is going to eventually put people out of business or put people to the point of going into bankruptcy, then, you know, there is a need to have that whole thought process take place, even though it's a state contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4061.867s">The</a>  state contract has subcontractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4063.939s">And</a>  the subcontractors have to be held liable, just like they were on the FAST 14 when they did the bridges a few years ago, the 14 bridges, 14 weeks in a row, and they put them up over a weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4075.385s">So,</a>  without going into that, and the other part I'd like to have, Mr. President, is have our city engineer report back to the council that since, in fact, they're building that portable bridge that's going to go over, they're pounding into the ground the structure to hold the <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4092.745s">the</a>  bridge and the arch of the bridge going across. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4095.407s">What</a>  impact, if anything, is that having on those buildings that abut not only the waterways, but the waterways in and of itself? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4103.612s">Don't</a>  forget, that bridge has been there for well in excess of 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4106.474s">It's</a>  built a solid granite, hasn't sunk an inch. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4109.516s">The</a>  only thing that's sunk an inch is the downtown Medford Square area. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4113.058s">So</a>  with that being said, building upon that granite, which the foundation is already there, yes, it's a cost savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4118.85s">But</a>  you've gone from $3 million up to almost $11.8 million to build a bridge that's 121 feet, and they're telling you it's taken two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4126.753s">So</a>  if it's taken two and a half years to build it, and they're not building it each and every day, six days a week, double-shift days, then that's the reason why it's taken two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4136.518s">Because</a>  these companies, subcontractors and major companies, basically are doing other jobs, and probably legitimately so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4147.538s">Because</a>  there's nothing in the contract that mandates that they do that job each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4152.839s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4155.86s">Call</a>  for that in two weeks, please.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4157.68s">On</a>  the motion as amended by Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4160.501s">And</a>  we also point out that part of the mitigation plan for construction was ongoing vibration monitoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4166.582s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4167.763s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4170.376s">I</a>  have to agree with my council colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4172.578s">The</a>  traffic is starting to get pretty rough down there, especially during the commuting hours, five o'clock early in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4182.145s">The</a>  fact of the matter is this is a state, Department of Transportation is overseeing this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4187.489s">I</a>  asked for the MBTA to come forward with a solution within the last three months or so, I believe it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4194.774s">We</a>  still have not heard back from them on that particular item. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4199.378s">But</a>  it's obvious that something has to be done because people shouldn't be expected to wait for a bus and be breathing in the debris, whether it's jackhammering and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4213.608s">So</a>  I think something has to be done, whether it be temporary or a more permanent solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4219.912s">But</a>  definitely something has to give on this particular situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4224.115s">So</a>  if we could have them in to discuss this, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4227.31s">Also</a>  to discuss some of the express buses that so many Medford residents in this community rely upon to get to work every day into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4237.564s">They're</a>  the subject right now of privatization. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4241.093s">with</a>  the MBTA, and I'd like to just get a status on where they're going and if the service is going to be as good, because quite honestly, I think the 326 and the 325 bus operated right now does a tremendous, brings tremendous value to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4258.898s">And</a>  it's on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4262.86s">It's</a>  packed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4263.9s">The</a>  express buses are packed every single morning going into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4267.748s">So</a>  I'd like to hear their plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4269.169s">Maybe</a>  I'll put that on at a later meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4272.331s">It's</a>  a separate issue because the bridge is more time consuming now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4277.235s">And</a>  I do support the councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4278.936s">So</a>  I'm going to withdraw that at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4281.618s">And</a>  I'm going to bring it forward in a later motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4285.761s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4286.281s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4287.842s">Councilor</a>  Camuso took the words right out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4289.984s">As</a>  someone who takes the 325 bus quite often, I feel it's the only bus I can take that's ever on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4294.747s">And</a>  from what I understand now, there are plans <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4297.614s">all</a>  to the personnel, privatize the route, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4301.978s">Although</a>  Councilor Camuso was gracious enough to withdraw his amendment, I feel as though if we're going to be bringing MassDOT down here and the MBTA down here, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4311.664s">that</a>  it's totally appropriate and, quite frankly, necessary that we find out what's going on with these buses as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4318.371s">And</a>  I'm not saying that just because I take it once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4320.633s">I'm</a>  saying that because when I sit there out my window, when I see people get on this bus, like my neighbor Chrissy and her two children that get on the bus every day, I have concerns about who's going to be operating these buses, where they're going to actually effectuate this cost savings, whether or not the service levels are still going to remain the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4336.163s">So,</a>  Councilor Camuso, I concur with your opinion that, you know, we definitely need to take a look at the express buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4342.809s">However,</a>  I do not concur with your opinion that we can do it later. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4346.072s">I</a>  think we need to do it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4347.713s">You</a>  know, this is a two-year construction project that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4350.896s">This</a>  privatization effort is going to be happening much sooner than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4353.618s">So,</a>  time is of the essence on both matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4357.081s">I</a>  commend Councilor Penta for bringing this issue forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4359.882s">I,</a>  too, have a number of concerns about the traffic flow patterns in Medford Square, where the bus stops are located. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4364.944s">And</a>  I think if we're really serious about revitalization of our downtowns, these are some things that we need to look at, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4370.886s">So</a>  thank you, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4372.346s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4374.007s">Mr.</a>  President, I move for approval as amended.</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4600.778s">And</a>  also with me tonight... Evan Tormey with XSS Hotels, 108 Jones Avenue in Fort Smith, New Hampshire, representing the hotel developer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4611.204s">So</a>  we are before the council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4614.387s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4617.49s">AC</a>  Hotels Marriott is working with Philadelphia Sign and they seek approval for two wall signs that have been denied by planning and zoning due to non-conformance to the city of Medford zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4628.078s">AC</a>  Hotels presented a comprehensive sign application package posing six wall signs on three facades of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4635.684s">Four</a>  of the signs were approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4637.571s">However,</a>  two signs, each on the north elevation, were denied due to non-performance, and the denials were attached in our application. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4645.158s">Sign</a>  A, in particular, exceeds the square footage allowed for primary sign, and sign D exceeds the number allowed for secondary signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4654.026s">Provided</a>  with our brief is an overview of all six signs, A through F, proposed, so the council will have a comprehensive view of the total sign package that we presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4664.39s">Mr.</a>  Tormey also has some nice large photo renderings that will give a better view of the proposed signage and the elevations, because our packets were pretty small. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4674.793s">AC</a>  Hotels feels that the building is in a unique situation due to all four sides of the hotel facing either a street or a parking lot, and that's why the number of signs were requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4687.636s">And</a>  there is a need for appropriate sized signage for visibility for fast-moving vehicles and the access roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4694.696s">Coupled</a>  with the fact that this is a new building with large, high facades, we feel the proposed signage is appropriate for the facades they are proposed on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4703.523s">The</a>  proposed signage is tastefully designed and will be properly installed and maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4708.687s">Approving</a>  the signage does not diminish from the intent of the bylaw, which allows for multiple wall signs, and will not pose any public safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4717.054s">By</a>  approving the additional two wall signs, AC Hotels feels that the new facility will be properly signed, ensuring safe arrival for guests to the hotel, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4724.939s">and</a>  therefore ensuring the hotel's success in Medford.</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4728.782s">So</a>  we do have a couple of renderings here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4732.366s">This</a>  perspective is from station landing looking to the southwest. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4736.469s">This</a>  is the main entrance of the hotel that you can see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4739.572s">So</a>  there is some signage proposed that's within the sign bylaw on the canopy. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4744.736s">The</a>  larger sign on the upper facade is one of the signs, sign A in question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4749.32s">The</a>  other sign in question is on the far side of this rendering. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4752.878s">That</a>  is facing north, visible to southbound traffic on 28. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4756.659s">I</a>  also have some renderings of other perspectives of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4763.321s">The</a>  other signs are located on the west elevation, as well as the south elevation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4767.963s">Again,</a>  visible from 28.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4775.745s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4776.334s">President</a>  Teller, so the two that have been denied, the A and the D, are both on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4780.835s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4781.195s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4781.655s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4781.975s">This</a>  large sign is here, and this sign on the right.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4785.696s">And</a>  give us, what is that about? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4787.817s">What</a>  is that facing now that's facing?</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4791.358s">So</a>  this is the site plan of the proposed hotel. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4794.419s">Here's</a>  President's Landing, the Fellsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4797.299s">So</a>  sign D is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4801.757s">kind</a>  of across from the Margaritas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4803.137s">Facing</a>  Margaritas. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4804.018s">Yes,</a>  and visible to southbound traffic on 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4808.099s">The</a>  larger sign at the entrance is located here more on station landing and it's kind of interior to the development facing the rest of the station landing development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4818.401s">Question?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4818.701s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4819.762s">Council</a>  Penta?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4821.042s">Any</a>  one of those signs, are either one of them interior lit? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4823.543s">Yes,</a>  this sign is internally illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4830.85s">So</a>  that's the only one that's going to be interior lit, that high one?</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4834.991s">As</a>  well as the canopy signage.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4839.992s">Then</a>  the question becomes on the big AC sign, does that have an 11 o'clock curfew? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4848.353s">Like</a>  across the street, let's say Kelly's Roast Beef. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4854.514s">I</a>  believe they have an 11 o'clock time and they change it to one on their time that the interior lit sign stays on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4865.648s">I</a>  think you just need to better check, because if we give you that, you're looking for that 24 hours a day to be lit?</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4871.111s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4871.651s">It</a>  is a 24 hour a day bill.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4872.832s">Because</a>  you're going to be right next to another company that I believe has a cutoff in its time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4877.774s">So</a>  I think before, I think you need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4881.336s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4883.937s">As</a>  a city, we're striving to bring in quality business and economic development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4887.739s">To</a>  tell a worldwide chain hotel that we can't have their sign lit up all the time, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4895.134s">There's</a>  no way I can support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4896.575s">If</a>  I supported that, it would be one of the worst votes I've ever taken as a member of the Medford City Council.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4900.738s">Mr.</a>  President, again, could you put that sign up again? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4904.521s">What</a>  are you facing?</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4905.902s">What's</a>  that big sign for? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4907.323s">What's</a>  number A facing? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4908.684s">This?</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4909.225s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4910.266s">I'm</a>  sorry, what was it? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4910.986s">What</a>  are you facing with that sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4912.167s">This</a>  is facing to the north, uh, 75 station landing, the apartment building, uh, the Boston sports club. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4918.152s">Uh,</a>  it faces also the parking garage.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4921.493s">Well,</a>  Mr. President, we need to be consistent if we're going to be consistent with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4924.74s">And</a>  I've got no problem with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4926.604s">It's</a>  just that, you know, there's a like business, you know, right next to you that I believe in one point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4933.054s">May</a>  I just point out at this— It's open, but I think the sign has to go off by 1 o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4937.915s">Councilor—</a>  Point of information, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4941.856s">Mr.</a>  President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4943.437s">I</a>  think this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4944.477s">Councilor</a>  Camuso, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4946.798s">Councilor</a>  Penta stated it's a like business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4949.779s">It's</a>  not a like business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4950.879s">One's</a>  a 24-hour lodging establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4952.899s">The</a>  other one is a roast beef joint. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4955.18s">It's</a>  not a like business.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4956.34s">The</a>  reason for the lighting restriction, if I remember correctly, for the roast beef joint, Kelly's, if you would, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4963.042s">was</a>  the fact that directly across from it was housing, and there was concern for those condominiums. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4968.885s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello had a point of information.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4971.106s">I</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4971.286s">I</a>  want to say the same thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4973.407s">It's</a>  a 24-hour business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4974.528s">So</a>  they operate every day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4981.011s">So</a>  I would think that they would need the illumination 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4985.234s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4985.774s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4986.114s">And</a>  again, this is a quality organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4989.736s">And</a>  I think we should appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=4992.732s">It's</a>  just a point of clarification as it relates to that you're facing a residential neighborhood, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5001.676s">There</a>  is a residential building to the north of the hotel.</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5003.737s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5004.418s">The</a>  business that we're talking about is likewise facing a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5008.259s">So</a>  all I'm saying is if you've already established a policy or a time, I've got no problem giving it to them 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5014.592s">But</a>  you're going to have to give the other people 24 hours.</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5019.134s">I</a>  believe the bylaw allows for the sign to be lit during the hours of operation, which would be different for a restaurant or a food service establishment, which is limited hours, whereas the hotel is open, as the Councilor has pointed out, 24 hours a day, with guests checking in at any time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5036.743s">Point</a>  of clarification for the petitioner, we can limit the hours that it's lit, and I see Councilors <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5044.211s">point,</a>  just because you're going to be facing apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5046.612s">So</a>  have you, have you, you know, any research on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5050.473s">We'll</a>  go in somebody's bedroom.</p>

    <p>[gKERczsOYPo_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5052.954s">We</a>  have not done any research in the apartment building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5055.215s">Uh,</a>  this has been presented a couple of times to residents, uh, open forums of that apartment building, 75 station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5062.637s">Um,</a>  and we, it was very well received. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5064.498s">We</a>  did not receive any concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5066.639s">Uh,</a>  we, these same renderings were shown at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5069.48s">There</a>  was no concern about the lighting, um, at those meetings.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5074.218s">I'll</a>  just put a six-month review on the lighting.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5077.741s">Councilor</a>  Knight has been patiently waiting.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5080.363s">Yeah,</a>  Mr. President, Councilor Lungo took the words right out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5084.927s">You</a>  know, these individuals are here petitioning us to approve a sign that's non-conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5089.871s">However,</a>  they'd like the sign to be governed under the actual ordinance that's in place for hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5094.575s">If</a>  they need to come back before us for a special permit, so be it at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5098.679s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5099.786s">in</a>  terms of holding up what they're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5101.909s">They're</a>  here under the governing ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5103.271s">They're</a>  asking us to approve a non-conforming sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5105.674s">The</a>  size of the sign is what they're asking for us to approve, not anything more or anything less. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5109.778s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't think it's... <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5112.288s">It's</a>  a bad idea now that we have a motion for a six-month review from the date of opening, I would like to say, that we can approve the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5120.794s">If</a>  we have problems with the illumination later on, we can review it in six months, and we can bring that issue to the neighbours, and I'm sure that the developer and the neighbours can work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5128.16s">I</a>  don't think they're coming to our community to invest millions and millions of dollars in here to make their neighbours upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5132.243s">So,</a>  you know, with that being said, I'd move for approval as amended by Councilor Longo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5136.746s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5137.407s">Councilor</a>  Camuso? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5138.287s">If</a>  I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5139.548s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5140.529s">I'm</a>  just a little bit... <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5142.359s">disturbed</a>  that the comments were made this evening regarding a hotel with the name Marriott on it that's looking to come in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5150.764s">We're</a>  trying to entice business into this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5154.066s">We</a>  have a hotel right out here that faces 400 units of senior housing developments right behind City Hall here that's illuminated 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5165.093s">Quite</a>  honestly, when the sign ordinance was written by members of the City Council over the last 30 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5171.504s">It's,</a>  I think, getting to the point where it's outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5175.747s">When</a>  a place like Meadow Glen Mall had to come before us a few years ago to have a sign that was basically comparable just to keep them in business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5184.251s">We</a>  got to have a vision moving this city forward, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5187.553s">And</a>  to say that a 24-hour hotel that we want to see come here, I mean, the hotel is going to generate <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5194.672s">taxes</a>  every single evening, every time a room is occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5197.894s">The</a>  hotel is going to generate economic development as far as people spending their money at Kelly's Roast Beef, at all the stations landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5207.799s">They're</a>  going to be using stuff over and Somerville is going to benefit by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5211.941s">Medford</a>  Square possibly will benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5213.902s">This</a>  is the vision we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5215.283s">We</a>  need vision to do Medford Square over and to sit here and to talk about not giving a 24-hour establishment, marry it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5223.807s">I</a>  mean, we're lucky that this didn't come up at the beginning of negotiations because a big company like Marriott may not even entertain coming here if they saw that we would even not entertain a sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5235.158s">And</a>  the sign is not overly bearing on the neighbourhood at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5239.401s">Quite</a>  honestly, there's more lighting coming off over here of the Hyatt right out back of our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5246.846s">In</a>  the interest of economic development and trying to move this city forward, I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5251.889s">And</a>  to be honest with you, I'm not going to support the six-month review, because I think it's done very tastefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5258.032s">I</a>  think it's a win-win for this community.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5261.693s">So...</a>  Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5266.896s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5268.937s">I,</a>  too, am very happy that the Marriott's coming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5271.919s">I</a>  think it's going to be a great addition to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5275.762s">I</a>  also have been on the council for 14 years, and I know that if there's people that aren't able to sleep due to the level of illumination or the time of illumination, we've heard from a number of residents who have had to come forward and voice their concerns and displeasure of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5293.168s">So</a>  I believe this is a great way to reintroduce the topic if need be in six months, whether that's just the level of illumination or <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5302.595s">you</a>  know, the hours of illumination. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5304.296s">It</a>  very well may be that nobody complains. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5306.677s">This</a>  is all well and good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5308.058s">It</a>  never comes before the council again. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5309.798s">And</a>  I assume that that is the way it's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5312.62s">But</a>  if there's a problem, this is the only way the council can possibly even alleviate it within six months.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5320.804s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5321.304s">The</a>  chair now recognizes the chairman of the subcommittee for business, economics, development, and science, Councilor Michael J. Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5332.668s">That's</a>  a tough act to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5336.351s">Mr.</a>  President, all the papers appear to be in order, and I agree with Councilor Longo, her statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5342.535s">We</a>  are the appeal process, and every member behind this council has the right to ask questions, whether they believe the signage is too large, whether they believe the illumination is too much, and those are the appropriate questions we should ask, and then we take a vote as a body. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5355.925s">So</a>  I'm not <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5359.378s">concerned</a>  about any particular questions, because that's what we're here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5362.2s">We're</a>  here to ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5363.961s">And</a>  I see no problem with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5366.182s">We</a>  welcome them into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5367.963s">I</a>  hope they do well and bring us plenty of tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5371.926s">And</a>  Mr. President, I, as chairman of the sign committee, would motion for approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5377.99s">Very</a>  good on that motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5380.671s">Motion</a>  to sever, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5382.632s">Motion</a>  to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5384.057s">The</a>  amendments, Councilor Camuso is not willing to support a certain portion of it, so it's going to be contrary. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5388.523s">I</a>  think we should sever the amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5389.664s">I'm</a>  sure he's in support of the hotel coming and getting the signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5392.929s">He's</a>  just not in support of the six-month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5394.911s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5395.352s">So</a>  motion to sever.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5395.993s">Motion</a>  to sever on the six-month review, Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5402.024s">Oh,</a>  I apologize.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5403.405s">I</a>  just want to wrap up by saying, you know, we're at a very unique juncture here in our community of either moving forward or moving backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5410.411s">We</a>  have a big development coming right across the city line. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5414.575s">It's</a>  going to be known as the Winn-Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5418.238s">We</a>  want to let businesses like the Marriott know that Medford wants them to come here and negotiate with us in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5426.078s">and</a>  potentially build something on Mystic Ave or wherever they find a parcel of land that may be good for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5434.9s">Because</a>  it has to be good for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5436.74s">But</a>  I just don't want to send the wrong message out there and have businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5441.381s">Because</a>  I've heard over the years, over the last 30 years in this community, people have been... People... I want to choose my words correctly and be fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5452.89s">We</a>  have heard that people feel uncomfortable sometimes when they come before some bodies here, particularly the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5460.293s">And</a>  I just think that in fairness for economic development views and where we're going with our neighboring community, I think we're at a juncture where we just have to show that we want to move the city forward, whether it be liquor licenses, whether it be hotel establishments, whether it be restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5481.118s">I</a>  just think we're at a great juncture to move the city forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5484.36s">And</a>  quite honestly, I just want to send the right message. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5487.061s">And</a>  that Councilor Knight took the words out of my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5489.102s">I</a>  do support the sign, naturally, but not the review at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5493.904s">It's</a>  done tastefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5495.085s">So</a>  if we could just sever it and then move on with the issue.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5498.226s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5498.767s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5499.847s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5500.948s">Mr.</a>  President, Councilor Coombs was correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5503.469s">Our</a>  sign order is over 20 years old now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5506.79s">Again,</a>  something that needs to be revisited. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5510.543s">These</a>  people, we're very happy to have them come into our committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5513.565s">They</a>  shouldn't have had to come up here tonight for a rejection when it should have been approved downstairs at the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5520.87s">Because</a>  again, our audience are old and some of them are antiquated. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5526.133s">We've</a>  changed our liquor laws several times to accommodate the new businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5531.617s">I</a>  talked about the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5534.319s">Our</a>  city is getting beat to death with competition from other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5538.54s">And</a>  we should be welcoming these businesses and they would open arms instead of having to come up here again and ask for a denial of a sign that should have been approved from day one.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5550.548s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5551.829s">Councilor</a>  Penter. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5553.81s">I</a>  appreciate the fact that you're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5555.251s">I</a>  support you, but I also understand <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5558.719s">that</a>  your development did not come here because of the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5561.4s">Your</a>  development came here because of Ted Tai and the business that he has there at Stations Landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5565.742s">You</a>  are the last part of the development of that whole development process over there, that six-story hotel, because when he came in here, it was gonna be in the beginning, but there wasn't a call for it economically. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5575.687s">This</a>  City of Medford needs to get out there as a unit, as a community, to look for businesses to come in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5581.19s">They</a>  haven't done it for a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5583.19s">This</a>  Medford City Council is equally to blame, equally to blame, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5586.77s">Because</a>  all we do sometimes is talk about it, and nothing's been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5589.571s">There's</a>  been no review of the sign ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5591.411s">There's</a>  been no review of the taxicab ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5593.411s">And</a>  we can go through all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5594.792s">So</a>  to get through all of that, you don't want to hear that, because that's not your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5598.693s">That's</a>  our problem over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5600.213s">So</a>  all I'm telling you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5601.373s">You</a>  understand that there are rules and regulations, and that's the reason why you got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5604.914s">And</a>  the reason why you're here, rather than going to the Board of Appeals, because it would cost you a hell of a lot of money to go to the Board of Appeals to appeal that, for which you're coming here before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5614.741s">That's</a>  the reason why the council put this in its sign ordinance many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5619.222s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5620.482s">And</a>  as a result of that, and I think you understand where we're going with all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5624.563s">So</a>  there's nothing wrong with a six month review. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5626.484s">As</a>  a matter of fact, it might make you a better and a stronger, have a relationship as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5631.645s">Cause</a>  when you can come back here, you can tell us all about the wonderful things you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5635.306s">You</a>  know, this city only operates with one and a half people, one and a half people out of an office of community development. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5640.947s">And</a>  I guarantee you never saw them once in your whole proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5643.848s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5644.617s">Because</a>  the reason we didn't say it, because they just don't have the manpower or the time or the wherewithal to come out there and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5651.101s">That's</a>  all going to change in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=5652.541s">There's</a>  going to be a new administration, and you're going to see a new life come into this community.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6156.889s">What</a>  is that specifically you're asking about?</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6159.15s">The</a>  audit that was to go into effect by the council about ten minutes ten months ago and also again about three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6167.554s">The</a>  audit of what? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6169.534s">What</a>  happens after that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6173.936s">If</a>  you could remind us of the streets that I remember you there was</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6179.628s">Well,</a>  one is the sidewalks, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6183.351s">But</a>  what happened now with the two requests that you put in, where does that request go to have an audit on the sidewalk or on the inspection?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6190.637s">It</a>  goes to the mayor's office.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6194.039s">So</a>  no news yet? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6195.821s">Nothing</a>  about the conditions or repairs or anything yet?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6200.765s">I</a>  think we get a response from the mayor, and he referred it to DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6206.049s">So</a>  ours is a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6207.958s">If</a>  it goes to the mayor, he refers it to DPW, and we haven't heard back since. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6211.921s">So</a>  we need to follow up, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6214.744s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6216.285s">Secondly,</a>  regarding bus routes, that was an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6220.468s">I</a>  also feel that they're getting worse than now, and now they're going to get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6224.191s">Because</a>  those rivets, if anyone did take the time to drive around to see them, they're from almost the donut shop all the way down to the CBS, across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6235.101s">You</a>  saw them, remember we were talking about them? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6237.102s">You</a>  step off the sidewalk, if it's an older people at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6240.383s">I</a>  helped a woman, she almost fell on her face. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6243.705s">They're</a>  like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6244.805s">Now</a>  they're in front of even Mr. Veneziano's business. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6248.567s">They're</a>  on the other side in front of Modern Pastry now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6251.308s">It's</a>  the weight and the heat, I believe, of the delivery trucks and the buses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6255.37s">And</a>  so someone suggested that night that you need to call the T. Did anyone call the T yet?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6260.412s">Mr.</a>  President, I think I put that on the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6264.482s">Two</a>  months ago, they had the team come down and look at the rolling hills there in Lippert Square, and we never got a response.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6274.824s">I</a>  think the nice thing about it is not that you want people to get hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6278.965s">The</a>  nice thing about addressing it is you can avoid some accidents that will save the city money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6283.546s">And</a>  not only that, it's coming winter again, and they're probably going to get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6287.006s">So</a>  I thank you very much, Mr. Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6289.627s">I</a>  wasn't coming here to criticize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6291.577s">I</a>  just wanted to get the status because I know you fellows are busy.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6295.404s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6296.406s">Some</a>  of them are five and six inches deep.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6298.688s">Oh,</a>  yeah, and now they're all along Salem Street, right going towards in front of the eyeglass shop, you know, Ricky Bazonga and the businessman down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6310.158s">I</a>  almost, I got out of the car just to say hello to him one day, and I went in one, and I said, Rick, this is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6316.323s">He</a>  said, tell me about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6317.224s">I</a>  have two people, and they don't see well when they come in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6320.026s">So</a>  I said, well, maybe I'll address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6321.528s">He</a>  said, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6322.809s">We</a>  can ask a motion to get the update as Councilor Marks <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6326.977s">As</a>  for. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6327.737s">So</a>  on the motion of Council Mark seconded by Councilor Musil.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6331.298s">And</a>  the tea has more money than we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6332.919s">So</a>  there you go.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6334.379s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6336.46s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6337.54s">We</a>  have a nice week.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6339.081s">Did</a>  you want to speak on this matter, ma'am?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6341.021s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6342.582s">The</a>  lighting is very, very bad over there at night when you're coming down, you can't see. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6348.164s">And</a>  someone's definitely going to get killed coming over all those bumps and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6352.965s">Like</a>  if someone's crossing, you won't be able to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6356.333s">It's</a>  very, very dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6357.394s">I</a>  don't know who drives under there at night.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6359.816s">Whereabouts</a>  are you talking?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6362.018s">At</a>  the bridge, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6362.739s">When</a>  you're coming off of Main Street to come into Medford Square?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6365.141s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6365.301s">Both</a>  areas going both ways.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6367.123s">Oh,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6368.043s">But</a>  more so on the coming into Medford Square, that side's more dark, coming under the bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6374.449s">It's</a>  dangerous.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6375.31s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6376.151s">Especially</a>  with the construction that's going on.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6377.892s">Send</a>  that to DPW, too.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6379.553s">You</a>  said that to the electrical department also? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6381.594s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Marksley, sent to the electrical department. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6384.616s">So</a>  on that motion, Councilor?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6385.777s">Mr.</a>  President, I do recall us taking a vote for $1.4 million for what was termed the Community Improvement Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6394.642s">And</a>  included in that Community Improvement Initiative was $300,000, I believe, for sidewalk and stump repair, as well as energy efficient lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6405.082s">change-outs</a>  down in Medford Square for brighter and more energy efficient lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6409.163s">Mr.</a>  President, if we can get an update on those two items.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6412.404s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Knight to include an update on the Community Improvement Initiative Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6418.686s">Councilor</a>  Camuso.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6419.746s">Just</a>  FYI, the sidewalks, massive sidewalk <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6426.405s">The</a>  plan that's been in the works is going to be taken off within the next two weeks or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6431.069s">They're</a>  waiting for that second bid to come in and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6433.191s">So</a>  if you notice, a lot of them are actually getting dug out right now by the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6437.134s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6437.735s">So</a>  you'll see them actively doing a lot of sidewalks over the next, until it gets cold out.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6444.761s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6446.783s">Ma'am,</a>  do you want to address the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6450.186s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6450.666s">So</a>  on the motion, <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6452.3s">As</a>  amended, as seconded. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6454.52s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6455.841s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6456.301s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6461.782s">Passes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6462.462s">Joanne</a>  Haney, 123 Placestead Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6464.262s">I</a>  just have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6466.063s">Verizon</a>  and Comcast are here in MedFed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6470.143s">We</a>  have a satellite dish. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6472.524s">Sometimes</a>  I like to watch what's going on in the city council, and we can't get it through satellite. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6479.098s">Is</a>  there any way that it can come into play? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6482.662s">Can</a>  I ask a question? <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6485.385s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6485.786s">Is</a>  there such a thing as a franchise agreement with the satellite provider?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6491.432s">I</a>  don't think there is, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6495.376s">You'd</a>  have to contact your satellite company, satellite provider, to ask if they have <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6500.77s">the</a>  capacity to connect with the local cable companies to provide you broadcast of the city meetings, I would imagine.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6513.697s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6515.838s">We</a>  have all the channels with satellite, but this is one that I can't get at all.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6522.342s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6523.683s">I</a>  have every cable channel you can imagine, and there's never anything on TV.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6529.97s">That's</a>  an exclusive contract we have with the cable provider. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6534.133s">And</a>  whether they allow the satellite to tap into that, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6539.238s">But</a>  I guess we can ask the question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6540.899s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6544.042s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6544.962s">Thanks,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6545.383s">Haney.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6546.103s">While</a>  we're on to suspension, offered by Councilor Caraviello, be resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Brooks PTO on winning the $20,000 contest <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6559.252s">At</a>  assembly row, councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6561.933s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6564.333s">As</a>  you saw in the paper last week, the Brooks Street GO won $20,000 from assembly row. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6573.516s">Amongst</a>  all the schools that went over there competed for the amount of points. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6579.097s">And</a>  our school was the winning school, and I want to commend them for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6585.787s">Tonight</a>  we approved three businesses, new businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6588.147s">Hopefully</a>  next year, two years down, we'll be able to have a contest similar to what Assembly Road does to invite other people to come into our city and spend some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6600.01s">And</a>  maybe we can award a prize. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6602.35s">Again,</a>  I want to congratulate the parents and the kids of the Brooks PTO.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6608.431s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6609.412s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello on the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6610.792s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6612.219s">for</a>  congratulations, Councilor Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6614.2s">On</a>  that particular motion, Rick, I think you forgot to say that they had to spend $200,000 in Somerville to get that $20,000 to come back to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6623.006s">So</a>  that's approximately $200,000 that could have been spent here in the city of Medford that didn't find its way here.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6628.83s">Hopefully</a>  when we get some new businesses here, we'll be more competitive with the other cities and we'll have our own contest someday. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6636.274s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q7cD9OP2TNA&t=6636.635s">On</a>  that motion, all those in favor?</p>
