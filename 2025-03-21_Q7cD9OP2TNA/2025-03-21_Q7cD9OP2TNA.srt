1
00:00:00,689 --> 00:00:05,132
[SPEAKER_15]: The 27th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:08,174
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:10,355 --> 00:00:21,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Camuso?

4
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:21,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

5
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:23,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caraviello?

6
00:00:23,684 --> 00:00:23,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

7
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:25,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

8
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:26,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

9
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:27,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

10
00:00:27,406 --> 00:00:27,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

11
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:28,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks?

12
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:29,548
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Penta, President Dello Russo.

14
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:35,285
[SPEAKER_15]: Present with seven present, none absent.

15
00:00:36,165 --> 00:00:38,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Please rise to salute the flag.

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:53,460
[SPEAKER_15]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

17
00:01:00,335 --> 00:01:14,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 15-644 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the City of Medford purchase the Aqua Hawk system and install it within the near future.

18
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:21,383
[SPEAKER_15]: The system would be applied to individual water meters as an individual meter leak detection system.

19
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:28,006
[SPEAKER_15]: This purchase and installation would relieve rate payers from having to pay substantial sums

20
00:01:28,577 --> 00:01:30,238
[SPEAKER_15]: due to leaks they were unaware of.

21
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:41,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it further resolved that the city council hold a meeting, committee meeting, to discuss a detection system to monitor leaks within our waterline infrastructure.

22
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:51,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Past leaks within our infrastructure have cost the rate payer a substantial amount of money, and we need to work to avoid this problem.

23
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,051
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President.

24
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:56,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

25
00:01:57,862 --> 00:02:03,765
[SPEAKER_11]: President Dello Russo, I put this on the agenda and it's probably actually long overdue.

26
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:18,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that we've had people at the podium who've come up, who've had leaks in their homes, who've been upset and had to displace a large amount of money when a leak probably could have been prevented or they could have been notified of such a leak.

27
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:23,713
[SPEAKER_11]: We field complaints all the time with regards to the water and sewer.

28
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:27,537
[SPEAKER_11]: rates and also, you know, people that have leaks.

29
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:36,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And recently I've got a couple complaints and it's unfortunate, but it's a city's policy that the Water and Sewer Commission cannot abate for leaks.

30
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:51,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I spoke to somebody on the Water and Sewer Commission and he blankly stated that at times it breaks his heart when he has a family or, you know, people who come in and cannot afford, they didn't know about the leak.

31
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:54,864
[SPEAKER_11]: They get a $1,000 bill because of a leak, and they can't afford it.

32
00:02:55,485 --> 00:03:02,829
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, we as a council years ago voted for the new meters, which we believed at the time would have a leak detection system.

33
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:08,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And if somebody was running a leak or ran a leak and had gone on vacation, they'd be notified.

34
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:12,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Somehow, we contacted and told that they have a leak.

35
00:03:13,356 --> 00:03:15,898
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't currently have that in place.

36
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:19,180
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the Water and Sewer Commission has discussed it.

37
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:32,115
[SPEAKER_11]: with regards to residential homes, and there is something called the Aquahawk system, which can be used and it's placed on individual water meters within the community.

38
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:47,519
[SPEAKER_11]: I think for the price, it's less than $25,000 to install throughout our whole community, but that would save our individual rate payers that happen to have a leak here and there a large, large amount of money.

39
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:59,871
[SPEAKER_11]: the pain that they go through, that some individual family would go through or is going through now, a great amount of money.

40
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:17,842
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually, the commissioner, engineer from a surrounding community, I won't say it specifically, but the city engineer from a surrounding community, actually, this happened to her recently, and she's very educated on the subject, and it really got my mind

41
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:32,912
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, she really enlightened me to a number of things and that got me talking to Dominic Camara and the Water and Sewer Commission and this is something that needs to be really looked into and implemented within the city of Medford.

42
00:04:34,394 --> 00:04:36,997
[SPEAKER_11]: This is actually for individual residences.

43
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:50,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, the larger system, it would obviously be more money, so we definitely need to sit down and have a committee meeting on it, be educated by the Water and Sewer Commission from what they know of it, the city engineer's office.

44
00:04:52,869 --> 00:05:00,491
[SPEAKER_11]: It would alleviate the problem with regards to the leaks we have in the miles of pipes we have throughout our city.

45
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,692
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's not a sexy issue, but

46
00:05:03,352 --> 00:05:10,194
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a leak a couple years ago, and one of those water lines was leaking a million gallons a day until we caught it.

47
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:14,755
[SPEAKER_11]: The MWRA had detection systems that were able to catch that.

48
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:29,538
[SPEAKER_11]: But if the city had something in place, we'd be able to catch these leaks within our own infrastructure much faster than we can catch them now, saving the taxpayer and the ratepayer a tremendous amount of money down the line.

49
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:40,159
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's an important issue, and I think especially the residential portion of it is important, and it's something that should be implemented as soon as possible.

50
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:57,245
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if the administration is in discussions with it, but I know the Water and Sewer Commission is, and I hope to send a paper and make it clear to our new mayor in January that this is something that needs to be implemented to alleviate repay his concerns and

51
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:04,902
[SPEAKER_11]: anybody who suffers from anything that so happens to be a leak within their home.

52
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:13,747
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely some of the stories I've been hearing and stories we've heard over the years through complaints and concerns, they are, they're heartbreaking.

53
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:20,332
[SPEAKER_11]: And if somebody's used to a $200 a quarter and they get a bill for 1,000 plus or 700 or some of the stories, 800 that I've been hearing,

54
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:30,320
[SPEAKER_11]: And that could be resolved with the simple Aquahawk system.

55
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's something we need to implement.

56
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:36,284
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for that important measure, Madam Vice President.

57
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:51,954
[SPEAKER_15]: May I take this opportunity to point out that the unfortunate thing of all this is that the system we have in place now was sold to us with the point of having this capability built into it.

58
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:54,456
[SPEAKER_15]: It's unfortunate we have to have this discussion now.

59
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:55,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

60
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:58,221
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

61
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:03,142
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'd like to commend Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.

62
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:05,342
[SPEAKER_18]: I do believe it's long overdue.

63
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:14,904
[SPEAKER_18]: When this program first went into inception, a gentleman by the name of Don Ouellette at the time said that we would have similar software to detect leaks.

64
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:21,825
[SPEAKER_18]: And also that unnamed city engineer from a surrounding community who brings a wealth of knowledge to our community as a resident.

65
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,626
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to commend her and thank her as well.

66
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:31,446
[SPEAKER_18]: With that being said, I support this wholeheartedly, and I think this is something that can't wait.

67
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:44,176
[SPEAKER_18]: Because just over the past few weeks, I know two people, one in particular with a water bill that went up about $1,000 in the water bill because of a leak in the lawn sprinkler irrigation system.

68
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,118
[SPEAKER_18]: It just kept going, going, and going.

69
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,300
[SPEAKER_18]: So I do support this wholeheartedly.

70
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,363
[SPEAKER_18]: And once again, I'd like to thank Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.

71
00:07:53,984 --> 00:07:55,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Camuso.

72
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,929
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion for Councilor Marks.

73
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:01,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

74
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, and I too would like to thank Council Lungo-Koehn.

75
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:25,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as was mentioned, um, this, uh, potential, um, system, uh, would be a cost savings, uh, for anyone that potentially has a leak in their home and something that I believe, uh, the city should be the watchdog, uh, alerting people, um, that, uh, there could be a potential issue within your home.

76
00:08:26,346 --> 00:08:31,987
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have people that go away for months on end to Florida or wherever else.

77
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:44,530
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's only appropriate that if, God forbid, something happened internally in your house, that the city would be able to get a contact number and reach out and say, we see a spike in your water over this period of time.

78
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,471
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that is only appropriate that we offer this.

79
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:56,013
[SPEAKER_05]: It was also mentioned by Councilor Longo that, you know, we have the capability currently

80
00:08:56,777 --> 00:09:08,303
[SPEAKER_05]: to install this, and we were sold the bill of goods back some years ago that the system we were putting in did have this software, and for whatever reason, it never came to fruition.

81
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:16,648
[SPEAKER_05]: But currently right now, unaccounted for water, which every water and sewer rate payer pays for, is roughly 20%.

82
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:23,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So 20% of our total water and sewer bill as a community is unaccounted for.

83
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Now part of that unaccounted for water

84
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,098
[SPEAKER_05]: is the city-owned municipal buildings and the school buildings.

85
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:41,542
[SPEAKER_05]: And according to Dominic Camara, the chairman of the Water and Sewer Commission, he believes about 10% of the unaccounted for water is through city-owned buildings.

86
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:55,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So that means that roughly about 10% is water that we're actually losing through old pipes, through leaks that are being undetected, and we're talking millions of dollars over a course of

87
00:09:55,876 --> 00:10:00,300
[SPEAKER_05]: several years that the rate payers are paying for water that we're not using.

88
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,645
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a small amount to pay to add that peace of mind for people.

89
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:14,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get a phone call saying, hey, possibly you have a leak or possibly we noticed there's a spike.

90
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:20,475
[SPEAKER_05]: The system, the way I understand it, will kick out exception reports.

91
00:10:20,956 --> 00:10:23,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll monitor your property for a period of time.

92
00:10:24,446 --> 00:10:30,788
[SPEAKER_05]: And then over time, it's going to tell, well, your water spikes Thursday night at a particular time, and you may know a reason.

93
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,310
[SPEAKER_05]: I do my laundry every Thursday night, so I know there's a spike, and I know that reason.

94
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:42,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it'll tell you, we've noticed throughout the course of the week that there's been a spike over last week.

95
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:48,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you know there's possibly a leak somewhere within your home if nothing's happening.

96
00:10:48,294 --> 00:10:51,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn on this.

97
00:10:51,556 --> 00:10:52,636
[SPEAKER_05]: This is long overdue.

98
00:10:53,293 --> 00:11:02,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe, as a council, we should be sending a message to the Water and Sewer Commission, as well as the administration, that we need this.

99
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:05,836
[SPEAKER_05]: And anything that we can do to save the ratepayers.

100
00:11:06,336 --> 00:11:09,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Water and sewer someday will be higher than your property tax.

101
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:17,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything we can do to save the ratepayers some money, I think the city is obligated to do so, Mr. President.

102
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Councilor.

103
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Penta.

104
00:11:22,122 --> 00:11:32,724
[SPEAKER_17]: The unfortunate part about talking about this here tonight, there is really no need to talk about it because we have about $7.5 million in our water and sewer surplus enterprise account.

105
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:47,088
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what the money is used for, whether it's this program here that's $25,000 or the program that was originally offered at approximately $100,000 would have identified, as Council Member Marx just alluded to, every single house on a particular day, a particular night, a particular time.

106
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:52,059
[SPEAKER_17]: the individual person who was having that water loss would be identified.

107
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,303
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, unfortunately, we have these new water meters, as we all know, for those of you that live in the city.

108
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:08,991
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're renters and rate payers, you'll understand that when they say that they have a policy not to give any abatements to someone who has a leak, that just doesn't sound right.

109
00:12:09,051 --> 00:12:14,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Because why should they not give an abatement to someone who's having a leak through no fault of their own?

110
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:15,755
[SPEAKER_17]: But is it through no fault of their own?

111
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:16,716
[SPEAKER_17]: It's probably the city's fault.

112
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,117
[SPEAKER_17]: They knew this was happening.

113
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:21,136
[SPEAKER_17]: They saw it coming, and they didn't do anything about it.

114
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:26,077
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to two meetings this past spring with the Water and Soil Commission to address this.

115
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:30,078
[SPEAKER_17]: But it has to have the support of the administration to spend this money to do it.

116
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:34,659
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, I thank my council colleague, Councilor Alango-Curran, for bringing this forward.

117
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully the council votes seven to nothing for it.

118
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:44,322
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's the city administration that has to grant this issue of going forward to have this detection program in sight.

119
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:47,603
[SPEAKER_17]: So hopefully all of you who voted for it and supported

120
00:12:48,878 --> 00:12:53,920
[SPEAKER_17]: It also is a beneficial asset to not only this community, but just saving water, too.

121
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether it's 20% or whatever the amount is that's unaccounted for, you're paying for it one way or the other.

122
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:00,943
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's not coming out of every single home.

123
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,744
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not even coming out of the homes that have these leaks.

124
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:12,228
[SPEAKER_17]: And the city in and of itself has its own leak problem beside the water that the city uses for its particular purposes for which you, the taxpayer, are being charged.

125
00:13:12,668 --> 00:13:18,010
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would like to have, just to bump this up one more degree, and not only support it,

126
00:13:18,627 --> 00:13:31,535
[SPEAKER_17]: But have a meeting, call for a meeting, Mr. President, with the Board of Water and Soil Commissioners for the purposes of going forward with this and any other proposal that might be necessary to finally resolve this problem once and for all.

127
00:13:32,556 --> 00:13:41,741
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Lago-Kern, as amended by Councilors Camuso and Penta, we have one more.

128
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:45,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I will be brief.

129
00:13:45,684 --> 00:13:47,885
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we have a packed house tonight this evening.

130
00:13:49,066 --> 00:13:51,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lungo, I appreciate you putting this resolution forward.

131
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:53,449
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly think it's a good idea in theory.

132
00:13:55,031 --> 00:14:05,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wondering if there are any other type of systems other than the Aquahawks system that might be out there, whether or not this is the best system for us to utilize, whether or not this is the one that we're going to get the most bang for our buck.

133
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:08,023
[SPEAKER_14]: I also do question the fact it was $25,000.

134
00:14:08,063 --> 00:14:08,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that the correct figure, $25,000?

135
00:14:09,084 --> 00:14:09,344
[SPEAKER_14]: Less than $25,000.

136
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:10,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Less than $25,000 per individual household.

137
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:15,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that correct?

138
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,210
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be per individual household.

139
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Citywide.

140
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Citywide, okay.

141
00:14:20,632 --> 00:14:22,994
[SPEAKER_14]: That changes things a little bit for me then.

142
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:28,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm doing the math and I'm saying it's going to be quite an expensive endeavor if it's $25,000 per household in the city.

143
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, with that being said, I have no problem supporting the endeavor.

144
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:43,370
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, $25,000 for infrastructure, it seems like a drop in the bucket to me, especially with the rewards that we'll receive on the other end of the investment.

145
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,158
[SPEAKER_14]: I wholeheartedly support it and move for approval.

146
00:14:46,558 --> 00:14:47,139
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

147
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,200
[SPEAKER_15]: So on that motion, Madam Vice President.

148
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:56,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to further amend it, if we're going to ask for a meeting with the Water and Sewer Commission, is that we also invite the city engineer who may have some input as to this.

149
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,083
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

150
00:14:57,103 --> 00:15:04,787
[SPEAKER_11]: And to answer Councilor Knight's questions, the Aquahawk is recommended by the Water and Sewer Commission.

151
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:08,429
[SPEAKER_11]: But we can research and see if there's any systems out there.

152
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:12,191
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just they've already done some major research and know what they want.

153
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,508
[SPEAKER_11]: said this would cost less than $25,000.

154
00:15:14,668 --> 00:15:23,195
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we just need to move forward and start our discussion with regards to the full infrastructure detection system.

155
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:35,706
[SPEAKER_11]: But with regards to the residences, I can't bear to have another resident call me with regards to asking me to help them with an abatement when I know they will never get an abatement.

156
00:15:35,766 --> 00:15:38,628
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a really sad situation.

157
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:40,610
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want it to happen to another family.

158
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we can move on that portion,

159
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,562
[SPEAKER_11]: more quickly.

160
00:15:44,022 --> 00:15:47,385
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree, we should be taking the money out of the Water and Sewer Enterprise account.

161
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:48,546
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the money's there for.

162
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:50,567
[SPEAKER_11]: There are millions of dollars in that account.

163
00:15:50,927 --> 00:15:58,794
[SPEAKER_11]: So I believe less than $25,000 would go a huge way to alleviating the problem.

164
00:15:59,654 --> 00:15:59,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

165
00:16:00,395 --> 00:16:02,036
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, all those in favor?

166
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call, Mr. President.

167
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:05,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call has been requested.

168
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

169
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:09,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Coonson?

170
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:10,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

171
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:12,118
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Gabriello?

172
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:12,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

173
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:13,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight?

174
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:13,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

175
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

176
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:16,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

177
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:17,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marx?

178
00:16:17,941 --> 00:16:18,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

179
00:16:18,722 --> 00:16:19,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Penta?

180
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:19,742
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

181
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:20,883
[SPEAKER_13]: President Dela Cruz?

182
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:21,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

183
00:16:21,983 --> 00:16:28,066
[SPEAKER_15]: On the vote of seven in the affirmative, none negative, the motion passes.

184
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:30,828
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-645, offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

185
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:37,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved, the City Council announces that the Granada Scary Walk Run will be held on Saturday, September 26, 2015,

186
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:41,271
[SPEAKER_15]: at the American Legion.

187
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:42,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President.

188
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

189
00:16:44,493 --> 00:16:51,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I know there's a number of things going on in the community every Saturday, every Sunday, but this is one that's been going on for many years.

190
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:55,217
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Granada Scary Walk Run.

191
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:56,437
[SPEAKER_11]: It starts at 10 o'clock.

192
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:57,858
[SPEAKER_11]: It's at the American Legion.

193
00:16:57,878 --> 00:17:06,461
[SPEAKER_11]: It goes to a great cause, and hopefully they always draw a great crowd, but hopefully they draw an excellent crowd on Saturday.

194
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:07,581
[SPEAKER_11]: It's supposed to be a beautiful day.

195
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:09,662
[SPEAKER_11]: So I wanted to specifically announce this.

196
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:13,742
[SPEAKER_11]: and hope that there's a great deal of attendance.

197
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:15,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

198
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:17,925
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn, all those in favour?

199
00:17:18,506 --> 00:17:19,126
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

200
00:17:19,426 --> 00:17:21,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

201
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:38,659
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-646, offered by Vice-President Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that Republic Parking respond to requests for appeals within a reasonable amount of time, such as less than 30 days, as the three-month waiting period that is taking place now is unreasonable.

202
00:17:38,719 --> 00:17:39,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice-President.

203
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:40,776
[SPEAKER_15]: The floor is yours.

204
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

205
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:51,379
[SPEAKER_11]: I've got three or four complaints with regards to the time Republic Parking is taking to respond to a request for appeal.

206
00:17:52,079 --> 00:18:07,724
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last gentleman that I had spoken to, I've been dealing with him back and forth, and he finally let me know that on the 89th day, he got a response that his parking appeal was being denied.

207
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:18,754
[SPEAKER_11]: That's, there must be some sort of writing that they have to respond within three months, yet they, I believe they told the city they'd be responding much faster than that.

208
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:28,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just, it leaves people wondering, second guessing, calling, I'm sure calling Republic Parking over and over again to ask, you know, what's going on with their appeal.

209
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:31,043
[SPEAKER_11]: I have another one that was from July 20th.

210
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:35,706
[SPEAKER_11]: This woman is appealing and she still has not got a response.

211
00:18:35,746 --> 00:18:36,667
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's two months.

212
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:50,877
[SPEAKER_11]: I know this is, when one other person called Republic Parking, they said the person who deals with appeals is the one that's actually doing the ticketing, so maybe they don't have enough time to do these appeals.

213
00:18:51,377 --> 00:19:00,885
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just feel that Republic Parking is not, the lack of response is really not a great way to do business.

214
00:19:01,245 --> 00:19:03,547
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, we have issues with the parking program,

215
00:19:04,013 --> 00:19:12,160
[SPEAKER_11]: as it stands with regards to everything, but this is just one additional thing that has caught my attention within the last few weeks.

216
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

217
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information.

218
00:19:16,283 --> 00:19:21,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you mention that the person that gave out the ticket is also responsible for doing the appeals?

219
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:22,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

220
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:32,677
[SPEAKER_11]: The gentleman who said he got his response within 89 days said he called the office and they told him maybe the delay is the fact that the person giving the

221
00:19:33,387 --> 00:19:35,869
[SPEAKER_11]: Handing out the tickets is the one that's supposed to handle the appeals.

222
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:46,115
[SPEAKER_11]: I think with regards to this response time, I know it's still in City Hall with regards to Diane McLeod as the actual hearing officer.

223
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:51,358
[SPEAKER_11]: But to even get a response, this woman from July 20th hasn't even got an answer.

224
00:19:51,438 --> 00:19:54,220
[SPEAKER_11]: She appealed it on the 25th of July, nothing.

225
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:03,125
[SPEAKER_11]: She's got nothing in the mail, nothing, no phone call, nobody telling her when her hearing will be, when she should appear at City Hall, nothing.

226
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:08,483
[SPEAKER_11]: And this other gentleman got it on day 89, one day short of three months.

227
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:09,823
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm assuming it's 89 days.

228
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:11,404
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's unreasonable.

229
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,344
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's ridiculous.

230
00:20:12,424 --> 00:20:17,146
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's just obviously the parking program is leaving a bad taste in people's mouths.

231
00:20:17,546 --> 00:20:21,807
[SPEAKER_11]: But everything you hear, it's just making it worse and worse.

232
00:20:22,568 --> 00:20:29,810
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just ask that Republic Parking, whether they need to hire somebody else or revamp their system of the way they're

233
00:20:30,157 --> 00:20:33,479
[SPEAKER_11]: dealing with things, this is one of the many issues that needs to be addressed.

234
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

235
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

236
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

237
00:20:38,301 --> 00:20:39,362
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with Councilor Longo.

238
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:42,783
[SPEAKER_06]: She was lucky to get through on the telephone.

239
00:20:43,323 --> 00:20:47,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I had made several phone calls, and I got started with the voicemail boxes all full.

240
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:52,908
[SPEAKER_06]: And after like three hours of trying to get through, I actually drove down there to see somebody.

241
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:55,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was told that they're kind of short-staffed.

242
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And I said, well, it's not really our problem that you can't do this.

243
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:03,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree, 30 days is more than enough time to do an appeal.

244
00:21:03,808 --> 00:21:08,589
[SPEAKER_06]: And anything after that, they should throw the appeal out and give the people their money back.

245
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:14,750
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't want to hire more people to work, the people who get tickets shouldn't have to suffer.

246
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:21,772
[SPEAKER_06]: So I said I'd make a motion that we send it on to them that maximum time for an appeal is 30 days.

247
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:26,013
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you can't respond within 30 days, then the ticket gets thrown out.

248
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:33,505
[SPEAKER_15]: So as amended, motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as amended by Councilor Caraviello.

249
00:21:33,545 --> 00:21:34,646
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

250
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:36,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

251
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:40,769
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly, too, would agree that a 30-day window is far too excessive.

252
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,431
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't pay your ticket within three weeks, they're hitting you with a fine.

253
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:46,853
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's good for the goose should be good for the gander, Mr. President.

254
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:52,577
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's important for this council to amend the paper this evening, and I'm going to make a motion to do such where we request

255
00:21:53,725 --> 00:21:59,887
[SPEAKER_14]: A report and statistical analysis of the appeals process from start to finish, how long it takes on average.

256
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:08,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd also like to see a number of appeals filed, as well as the number of outstanding appeals, Mr. President.

257
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:11,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Number of appeals filed in number of outstanding appeals.

258
00:22:11,941 --> 00:22:34,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, sir Yes, and then it might make sense based upon some of the information that's been shared with us this evening to get an organization an organizational chart Mr. President as well, so we know who's in charge of what and who's doing what I'm making sure that the count the clerk has that amendment down correctly your point of information Councilor Penta.

259
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,040
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a necktie

260
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:42,528
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think we need that for what you're asking, because we've been asking for a monthly report that would include that for what you have.

261
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:45,128
[SPEAKER_17]: We've only got one monthly report so far.

262
00:22:45,788 --> 00:22:50,390
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you don't mind, can we just up it to say we'd like to have an up-to-date report on everything.

263
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:57,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Tickets, citations, amount received, appeals pending, tickets that have been waived, and tickets that have been given up.

264
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Because that's what basically the report gave us before.

265
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,342
[SPEAKER_17]: So rather than extrapolate it out of one or two issues, why don't we just ask for the complete report that we should be getting that we've asked for?

266
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:10,923
[SPEAKER_14]: We can ask for that as well, but I'd like to see it in this format as well.

267
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:13,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to take a look and see how long it takes from start to finish.

268
00:23:13,244 --> 00:23:13,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

269
00:23:13,484 --> 00:23:15,925
[SPEAKER_14]: So when Councilor has the floor, he can make that amendment.

270
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:16,625
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

271
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,026
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand where you're coming from, Councilor.

272
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,147
[SPEAKER_14]: I certainly appreciate it.

273
00:23:20,207 --> 00:23:23,588
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I'd like to see this data and this information for some personal analysis.

274
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:27,549
[SPEAKER_14]: But with that being said, I rest my case, Mr. President.

275
00:23:27,569 --> 00:23:29,410
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to amend the paper as noted.

276
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:31,332
[SPEAKER_14]: I would move for approval.

277
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:39,699
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn as amended by Councilors Caraviello and Councilors, Councilor Knight, Councilor Camuso.

278
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,460
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

279
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,103
[SPEAKER_18]: And once again, I want to thank Councilwoman Lungo-Koehn for bringing this up.

280
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:46,745
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I do think it's, it's unacceptable.

281
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:53,952
[SPEAKER_18]: The timeframe, uh, as Councilor Knight alluded to, if you don't pay the ticket within 28 days, they start adding on fees and everything else.

282
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:03,449
[SPEAKER_18]: To not have at least a hearing and go through the due process within a reasonable period of time, it definitely is a major issue.

283
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:12,758
[SPEAKER_18]: I do know that this week, several people I've talked to, and I actually have one, I'll bring it next week, but received their decisions via email.

284
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:20,180
[SPEAKER_18]: They're actually emailing the decisions to people to be environmentally friendly, or probably to save money, I'm sure, where it's the company.

285
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,644
[SPEAKER_18]: But people did get their adjudication notices this week.

286
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:26,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Some people did.

287
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:33,831
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not sure when the appeals actually were made, but be interested to look at that data as well.

288
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:35,552
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's probably a good time.

289
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:58,462
[SPEAKER_18]: maybe in the month of October sometime to have a committee of the whole and just go over the whole program where it's ten months into inception and where we're at prior to getting to the winter months, find out what the plan is going to be to make sure that everything is shoveled out in a prudent manner before the first snowstorm comes and hits and then we're running around trying to figure that out.

290
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:00,263
[SPEAKER_18]: So I would like to

291
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:14,821
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to ask that this be amended to have a committee of the whole meeting, uh, towards the middle of my middle of October, possibly, um, or anytime in October, next week, whatever, to, um, to just go over the whole parking program where we're at.

292
00:25:15,562 --> 00:25:19,064
[SPEAKER_18]: And we can actually dig into all the reports that council and night just requested.

293
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:23,426
[SPEAKER_18]: So I do support the, uh, Councilor wholeheartedly as well as the amendments.

294
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:25,387
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

295
00:25:25,427 --> 00:25:28,068
[SPEAKER_18]: So as amended by council, Camuso council care of yellow,

296
00:25:29,604 --> 00:25:30,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Noah.

297
00:25:30,104 --> 00:25:33,447
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to ask for the same report that Councilor Pinter asked for, a full report.

298
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:34,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

299
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:37,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Does Councilor Pinter wish to ask for that report as an amendment?

300
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:37,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

301
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:47,900
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the, uh, a report requested during his point of information, uh, now is asked as an amendment to the main motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

302
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:56,347
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, on all of that, the motion of, uh, Councilor Lungo-Koehn as amended by several of the councilors,

303
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:57,986
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Camuso?

304
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:01,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I was able to track that back through my emails, actually.

305
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,870
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a violation that was issued MDC 5482.

306
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,753
[SPEAKER_18]: It was issued on 8-15-2015 at 5-16 in the evening.

307
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:13,334
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was turned around within a month.

308
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:16,756
[SPEAKER_18]: So there may be something going on with the specific ones in question.

309
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:25,580
[SPEAKER_18]: But the notice that someone sent to me saying that the adjudication and stuff took place, that is the date that the violation was issued.

310
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:28,863
[SPEAKER_18]: on the ticket in question.

311
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:36,485
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm starting to think maybe that's one person that's not doing their job possibly, but we have to investigate it.

312
00:26:37,186 --> 00:26:37,646
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

313
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:40,567
[SPEAKER_18]: We need that report and we certainly need that committee meeting.

314
00:26:41,127 --> 00:26:42,628
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion, Councilor Marks.

315
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:44,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

316
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:55,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Councilor Knight brought up a great idea regarding the staffing tree, because if you have staff that's responsible for giving out tickets, which in my opinion is a full-time position,

317
00:26:56,423 --> 00:27:01,066
[SPEAKER_05]: and then also responsible for sending out the hearing notices, which is also a full-time position.

318
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:04,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to see what the current staffing is.

319
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:12,614
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a very worthy request and also see what the hierarchy is within this particular organization.

320
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:13,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

321
00:27:13,774 --> 00:27:25,162
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Councilor Marks, we now invite the members of the public who are patiently waiting to address the council regarding this particular motion, which is before us, we ask that you

322
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:28,862
[SPEAKER_15]: State your name and address for the record before you speak.

323
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:30,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.

324
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:32,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name's Chris Capri.

325
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:35,945
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 10 Salem Street, Chris Capri Salon.

326
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:40,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you know, I'm here on the same issue.

327
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:44,148
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make some amendments on this parking meters.

328
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:45,529
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not working.

329
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:53,532
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more frustrated people coming in the salon and they were all anxious because they were afraid they're going to get a ticket.

330
00:27:54,479 --> 00:27:58,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the clients last Saturday, she got two tickets on her car.

331
00:27:59,841 --> 00:28:02,902
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many tickets do you give for one car?

332
00:28:03,963 --> 00:28:04,823
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand it.

333
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:06,264
[SPEAKER_00]: No one understands the rules.

334
00:28:07,344 --> 00:28:09,105
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea what they're doing.

335
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:13,346
[SPEAKER_00]: I see them outside fiddling and trying to get the meters to work.

336
00:28:14,187 --> 00:28:19,288
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my clients comes from puberty every week, and every week she has the same problem.

337
00:28:19,609 --> 00:28:20,509
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't take her money.

338
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:25,374
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's got to be some adjustments made and who's going to make them.

339
00:28:26,395 --> 00:28:27,236
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to know.

340
00:28:28,597 --> 00:28:31,799
[SPEAKER_00]: People need more education on it because we don't know what we're doing here.

341
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,364
[SPEAKER_00]: And two hours is not enough when you have a salon, especially.

342
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:44,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even if you're going out to dinner, you got to worry about running out and moving, physically moving your car.

343
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:46,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we have to move our car?

344
00:28:47,391 --> 00:28:48,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't everything about money?

345
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,822
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference whose car is parked there so long as they're getting paid for it?

346
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:55,744
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get it.

347
00:28:57,725 --> 00:28:58,546
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we do about it?

348
00:29:00,687 --> 00:29:02,168
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is there a way out of this?

349
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:07,272
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my question.

350
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:08,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way out of this?

351
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:09,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

352
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:18,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Chris, you've been up before the Councilor a number of times on this very same issue, and I think we've had a lot of back and forth and discussion about what options are available to you.

353
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:42,190
[SPEAKER_14]: have you gone to the traffic commission and all as we've suggested in the past and have brought up any of these concerns with the traffic commission is responsible for setting traffic policy here in medford no no because i really don't know who to talk to traffic commission will probably be a place to start i think we might have brought that up a couple of other times at other meetings um but i can certainly understand your frustration i think that you know in looking at

354
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:44,126
[SPEAKER_14]: how we're going to approach the META system.

355
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:45,946
[SPEAKER_14]: The program was rolled out bad.

356
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:47,007
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no question about that.

357
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:49,147
[SPEAKER_14]: But the program definitely needs to be tweaked.

358
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:50,608
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no question about that, too.

359
00:29:50,928 --> 00:29:52,569
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've had some successes in that regard.

360
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:59,171
[SPEAKER_14]: My question is, I guess we have several resolutions right now that are pending before the Traffic Commission that we haven't gotten responses to, Mr. President.

361
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:04,933
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to ask that we remind the Traffic Commission that we have a couple of outstanding resolutions that need some responses.

362
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:09,035
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd ask the city clerk to add that as part of the paper.

363
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:15,250
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the main motion by Vice President Longo-Curran, further amended by Councilor Knight.

364
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,831
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, the Traffic Commission sets the traffic policy in the City of Metro, not the City Council.

365
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:22,593
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, the only way that we can effectuate change is by asking.

366
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:23,394
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

367
00:30:23,414 --> 00:30:23,814
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

368
00:30:24,754 --> 00:30:25,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Jim is correct.

369
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:27,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Mr. President.

370
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jim.

371
00:30:28,456 --> 00:30:30,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everybody.

372
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:35,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, we have to talk about the parking meters.

373
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,401
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very, very

374
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:39,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Very bad.

375
00:30:39,362 --> 00:30:41,683
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, business very awful.

376
00:30:43,804 --> 00:30:45,244
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to do something about it.

377
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:50,346
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of customers, they said, Jimmy, we go to Winchester, we go Arlington.

378
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:53,967
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I appreciate a lot of customers.

379
00:30:54,307 --> 00:31:01,189
[SPEAKER_04]: They walk, they don't come with the cars no more from places that are up Madison, Boston Avenue.

380
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:05,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I feel bad because I've got two pitches to carry over to Madison Street.

381
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:06,731
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, you want to give your right?

382
00:31:08,356 --> 00:31:08,996
[SPEAKER_04]: So what am I going to do?

383
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:09,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to do business.

384
00:31:10,297 --> 00:31:12,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, Jimmy, I can't park.

385
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,119
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost the lands about 35%.

386
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:19,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Used to people read the paper.

387
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,582
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they sit in for 20 minutes.

388
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:23,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Not anymore.

389
00:31:24,024 --> 00:31:25,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot my phone.

390
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:30,247
[SPEAKER_04]: I got pictures every day to see the whole part, you know, the front empty.

391
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:37,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I can bring my phone to give a proof.

392
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day, no cars at all.

393
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:43,314
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the meter they makes about $10, $15 a day.

394
00:31:43,814 --> 00:31:46,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think what kind of money the city's going to make with these meters.

395
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:49,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know.

396
00:31:49,358 --> 00:31:50,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a suggestion.

397
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:58,144
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can put it, the old time meters, I don't think anybody with a quarter, I think, works better off.

398
00:32:00,426 --> 00:32:01,006
[SPEAKER_04]: The old meters?

399
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:02,007
[SPEAKER_04]: The old meters.

400
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,489
[SPEAKER_04]: These don't work at all.

401
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:10,386
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of complaints every day, every day, every day.

402
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:20,029
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to take this serious because I think another six months, there are going to be any business in this city.

403
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:24,131
[SPEAKER_04]: There are going to be any cities and any business.

404
00:32:25,471 --> 00:32:30,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, you know, the last quarter, I tried to make my taxes because I got a large bill.

405
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:34,734
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I own the building also besides the gyms, pizza.

406
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,141
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was late to pay my tax.

407
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:39,422
[SPEAKER_04]: They put $222.

408
00:32:40,102 --> 00:32:44,785
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to pay, you know, penalty interest because I'm late.

409
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes my tenant, they bring the payment late.

410
00:32:49,527 --> 00:32:51,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a tenant, they don't pay me water for three years.

411
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:53,869
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I going to do?

412
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,792
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, get out, and then I got to take forever to rent my spot.

413
00:33:03,054 --> 00:33:04,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very serious, you know.

414
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:08,066
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to do something about it.

415
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:11,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no business.

416
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:12,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Pender.

417
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:13,929
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President.

418
00:33:13,969 --> 00:33:14,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

419
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Madam Vice President.

420
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,952
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to answer, I think they're looking for us for a response.

421
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:24,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, just want to let you know, we've taken some serious votes with regards to the parking.

422
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:27,296
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gone to, like Councilor Knight said, to the traffic commission.

423
00:33:27,676 --> 00:33:33,499
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're trying to get the mayor to listen to us with regards to, we've talked about eliminating it.

424
00:33:34,392 --> 00:33:35,933
[SPEAKER_11]: serious changes that need to be made.

425
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:41,716
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the traffic commission has made some changes, but we've requested 30 minutes free parking.

426
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:45,018
[SPEAKER_11]: We've asked them to discuss an hour of free parking.

427
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:46,719
[SPEAKER_11]: We've asked them to eliminate the meters.

428
00:33:47,139 --> 00:33:49,160
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just waiting for a response.

429
00:33:49,180 --> 00:34:00,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully come January 1st, there's either some major tweaking or another system is put in place to create the turnover but not create this situation that we're in.

430
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:03,713
[SPEAKER_04]: complete.

431
00:34:04,273 --> 00:34:07,056
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no changes or half an hour, two hours.

432
00:34:07,316 --> 00:34:10,059
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to work for this city.

433
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of people in West Medford especially.

434
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:22,152
[SPEAKER_04]: All local people, they come go to the bank, they come to me, they go next to Arthur's Bakery or the tailor.

435
00:34:23,553 --> 00:34:24,555
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the people there.

436
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:25,435
[SPEAKER_04]: They park all day.

437
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:29,945
[SPEAKER_04]: They happens maybe in 15 years, two times.

438
00:34:30,286 --> 00:34:35,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a car for six, seven hours, and then I call the police and say, what's going on, seven hours.

439
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:37,509
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't have any problems.

440
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:41,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

441
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,272
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President, you're all set?

442
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:44,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you.

443
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:45,833
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso has the floor next.

444
00:34:46,773 --> 00:34:52,416
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to let the residents know the city of Arlington put out a press release last week.

445
00:34:53,356 --> 00:34:56,358
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going parking kiosks and meters, the entire

446
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:58,513
[SPEAKER_18]: City, Massachusetts Avenue.

447
00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:01,975
[SPEAKER_18]: Right now they're in the parking lots and they're actually putting them out on Massachusetts Avenue.

448
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:05,798
[SPEAKER_18]: They're rolling it out according to the city manager in Arlington.

449
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,401
[SPEAKER_18]: So, just as a point of information.

450
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:10,481
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

451
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta.

452
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,103
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the city of Medford.

453
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:15,685
[SPEAKER_17]: This isn't Arlington, Belmont, Winchester, or any other town.

454
00:35:15,725 --> 00:35:16,646
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the city of Medford.

455
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:20,308
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to go back to February 3rd of this past year, February 3rd of 2015.

456
00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:24,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks asked a very important question.

457
00:35:24,937 --> 00:35:37,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Because one of the problems that we were having over here was that people would get out of their car, go to the kiosk, put their money in, and by the time they came back, they were getting a ticket because these bounty hunters were there ready to land on you.

458
00:35:37,784 --> 00:35:43,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, this past weekend, I observed two particular situations in the far end parking lot here in Nutford Square.

459
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:48,070
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were both two, one a woman with a child, another one was an elderly lady.

460
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Both of them were coming out of wherever they were, respectively.

461
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:52,752
[SPEAKER_17]: They had their tickets in their hand.

462
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,173
[SPEAKER_17]: They were walking toward their cars.

463
00:35:54,702 --> 00:35:56,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Those trucks were waiting right there.

464
00:35:56,543 --> 00:36:01,026
[SPEAKER_17]: One woman was within one minute of having that thing expired or she would have got a ticket.

465
00:36:01,386 --> 00:36:04,188
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other woman was two minutes, one minute and two minutes.

466
00:36:04,508 --> 00:36:06,409
[SPEAKER_17]: And they were right there, ready to go.

467
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:18,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Council Marks asked the traffic commission to give a 15 minute leeway before and after for someone who would park their car, just as just one of the issues to park their car to go to and from.

468
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:19,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Now,

469
00:36:19,798 --> 00:36:22,560
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't make any sense at all, because these folks are out of town.

470
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,941
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't even come from the city of Medford.

471
00:36:23,961 --> 00:36:25,362
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't even come from Massachusetts.

472
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:27,704
[SPEAKER_17]: They're only here for one thing, is to make money.

473
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,867
[SPEAKER_17]: And to me, it's anti-business, and it's anti-consumer for the citizens of Medford.

474
00:36:32,927 --> 00:36:36,029
[SPEAKER_17]: People keep saying, other cities and towns do this and that.

475
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:40,092
[SPEAKER_17]: It's good to look and see what other cities and towns do, because you can probably land.

476
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,654
[SPEAKER_17]: But Medford has to be unique unto itself.

477
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:45,176
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be its own person, so to speak.

478
00:36:45,776 --> 00:36:48,058
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we've had it this way for a long period of time,

479
00:36:48,593 --> 00:37:09,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe what we really need to do is to go back and look at the 2009 report for which this mayor commissioned and asked them to report back and for which this mayor did not heed their advice, which was very simple, to have a traffic enforcement plan with proper signage and enforcement and see where that took you on a very small scale, slowly but surely.

480
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:11,411
[SPEAKER_17]: We went from A to Z overnight just like that.

481
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:13,473
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, it's in the dead of winter.

482
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:15,855
[SPEAKER_17]: But forget the winter because it's come and gone.

483
00:37:16,245 --> 00:37:18,967
[SPEAKER_17]: You've had all your summer months, and now you're getting into the early fall.

484
00:37:20,028 --> 00:37:21,069
[SPEAKER_17]: It just isn't getting better.

485
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,231
[SPEAKER_17]: They're just pounding away these people.

486
00:37:23,652 --> 00:37:37,004
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you think of a business such as this that makes tremendous, they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars, and they operate from 8 in the morning to 6 o'clock at night, and they're not open on Saturday, which is a legitimate business day in the business world of today.

487
00:37:37,384 --> 00:37:39,466
[SPEAKER_17]: And the folks in this community that have to have an appeal

488
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:50,843
[SPEAKER_17]: As Councilor Lungo just alluded to, they can't even go, because if they're working from Monday through Friday, their appeal process should be able to be taken care of on a Saturday, at least within a month's period of time at maximum.

489
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:52,623
[SPEAKER_17]: You do have options.

490
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:54,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Your options can be a buyout.

491
00:37:54,284 --> 00:37:55,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Your options can be to change it.

492
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:58,585
[SPEAKER_17]: But you can't even consider the idea of tweaking it.

493
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:02,387
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people want to say, well, we're going to give it out to all our seniors for nothing.

494
00:38:03,007 --> 00:38:06,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if I was Republican and I was looking at that comment, I'd say, wait a minute.

495
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:09,881
[SPEAKER_17]: It's bad enough you took my 7 to 7 away, you now brought me down 8 to 6.

496
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:11,622
[SPEAKER_17]: That's 12 hours a week.

497
00:38:12,203 --> 00:38:14,224
[SPEAKER_17]: That's 48 hours a month you're taking away from me.

498
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:15,766
[SPEAKER_17]: That's profit in my pocket.

499
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:17,407
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not what the contract says.

500
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:31,419
[SPEAKER_17]: And even though the city solicitor says that the city of Medford has the right to change the time, and they also have the right to change the rates, I don't think that would fly in the contract because if you read the contract, it's quite specific as it relates to what you can and cannot do.

501
00:38:34,794 --> 00:38:38,136
[SPEAKER_18]: One week, we want to get out of the contract because it's broken.

502
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:48,242
[SPEAKER_18]: This week, there's maybe recommendations to do stuff that was well within our right, like giving senior citizens passes where they're exempted.

503
00:38:48,862 --> 00:38:50,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's make up our mind.

504
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:54,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we either going to follow the contract or do within our right of the contract?

505
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:59,628
[SPEAKER_18]: I wholeheartedly support giving senior citizens free parking privileges in the city.

506
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:02,050
[SPEAKER_18]: These people no longer have children in the public schools.

507
00:39:02,723 --> 00:39:08,106
[SPEAKER_18]: These children, the senior citizens of our community, have made Medford great the way it is today.

508
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:21,594
[SPEAKER_18]: So to sit here and go against something that's positive and say that the company, the company, the company, I just feel that I think we have to do what's right by the residents and the city of Medford, not the company.

509
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:22,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not worried about the company.

510
00:39:26,717 --> 00:39:31,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it ironic a month before a major election that

511
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:36,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Candidates now want to give senior citizens free parking on the streets.

512
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:41,075
[SPEAKER_05]: But a year and a half ago, when they created this program, there was never any mention about that at all.

513
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:46,039
[SPEAKER_05]: So I find that ironic now, all of a sudden, people want to give out free parking everywhere.

514
00:39:46,379 --> 00:39:50,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we want to give out free parking, why did the mayor litter our streets with kiosk?

515
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:56,627
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not quite sure if that argument holds any credibility.

516
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:02,977
[SPEAKER_17]: What we're talking about here is a system that's broken.

517
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:04,017
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't work.

518
00:40:04,918 --> 00:40:12,221
[SPEAKER_17]: We're talking about a system that has caused so much anxiety to business folks and to consumers and to our own residents here in the city of Medford.

519
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:16,203
[SPEAKER_17]: And the fact of the matter is there was no public meetings on this.

520
00:40:16,243 --> 00:40:17,784
[SPEAKER_17]: There was no public hearings on this.

521
00:40:18,404 --> 00:40:29,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Last year in October, the city of Medford city council asked on three separate times through resolutions to have these types of meeting with the downtown business areas and to have the chamber included and to have the residents included.

522
00:40:29,747 --> 00:40:33,749
[SPEAKER_17]: And the mayor ignored all of those requests, only to sign the contract.

523
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:35,710
[SPEAKER_17]: And what you have is what you've got right now.

524
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:43,834
[SPEAKER_17]: A complete debacle of an operation that has absolutely and serves no purpose here in the city of Medford.

525
00:40:44,554 --> 00:40:45,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Just think about it.

526
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,255
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll leave you with this last thought.

527
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:51,277
[SPEAKER_17]: We're all talking about the problems, and we're going to sit down and have another meeting, another meeting, and another meeting.

528
00:40:51,697 --> 00:40:53,398
[SPEAKER_17]: This has been going on for well over a year.

529
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And because there was no transparency to this whole operation,

530
00:40:57,223 --> 00:41:13,826
[SPEAKER_17]: And because there was no communication back and forth, and because there was no thought process as it relates to what possibly could happen, what can't we do, what should we do, that in and of itself has got to tell you, you can't keep talking about changing a program knowing it doesn't work.

531
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:16,126
[SPEAKER_17]: If it doesn't work, you do one of two things.

532
00:41:16,566 --> 00:41:23,047
[SPEAKER_17]: You get rid of it, and you start all over again, slowly but surely you have a sense of transparency, and that's the way it should be.

533
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:26,928
[SPEAKER_17]: So the people of this community who are paying for it understand what's going on.

534
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:28,650
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

535
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:33,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

536
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:35,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso talked about how Arlington is doing this.

537
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:40,893
[SPEAKER_06]: What they're doing is they have purchased meters that give you 15 minutes of free time.

538
00:41:40,913 --> 00:41:46,074
[SPEAKER_06]: When you pull up to the spot, you hit the button, and you get 15 minutes of free time.

539
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:48,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're going with the meter heads in.

540
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:54,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, maybe it's something that our city looks into going forward as part of the adjustment period.

541
00:41:56,077 --> 00:41:56,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

542
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:57,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

543
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:11,609
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, it's my understanding in talking to the mayor, meters are going to be starting to pop up, the regular old-fashioned meters that Medford Square had back in the 80s within our community.

544
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:23,278
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's going to be the regular standalone meters that Chris alluded to, where you just throw the quarter in, and those are going to be starting to get sprinkled around the community.

545
00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:28,102
[SPEAKER_18]: The elephant in the room here is twofold as far as I'm concerned with the parking.

546
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:31,645
[SPEAKER_18]: to just get out of this pocket, and it's going to cost us, as of today, $1.1 million.

547
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:33,046
[SPEAKER_18]: $1.1 million to get out of it.

548
00:42:33,086 --> 00:42:34,787
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information, Mr. President.

549
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:41,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

550
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:47,772
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad that Councilor Camuso had a conversation with the mayor about now we're going to see meters throughout the community.

551
00:42:48,593 --> 00:42:56,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet again, another item that the mayor never involved the business community, never involved this council, never had a public hearing,

552
00:42:57,263 --> 00:43:00,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the reason why we're in the predicament we're in now, Mr. President.

553
00:43:00,465 --> 00:43:19,097
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, if I may, um, the evening that the business owners were at our meeting, when this council voted seven to nothing to send out the, um, to negotiate with Republic parking, it was a seven to nothing vote of the Medford city council that evening and included in that was kiosks and meters.

554
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:20,355
[SPEAKER_18]: clearly in there.

555
00:43:20,595 --> 00:43:27,058
[SPEAKER_18]: There was businesses throughout the community that came up that evening and made mention that they would like to have regular meters in front of their stores.

556
00:43:27,458 --> 00:43:40,243
[SPEAKER_18]: I know several in West Medford, several in Medford Square have approached the city, would be interested in having the quarter meters in front of their business because it's the type of business where you're just running in in one quarter and rather than going to the kiosk.

557
00:43:40,763 --> 00:43:44,705
[SPEAKER_18]: So with that being said, like I said a few minutes ago,

558
00:43:45,112 --> 00:43:50,454
[SPEAKER_18]: To get out of it and wipe this out totally, it's $1.1 million as of today.

559
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,294
[SPEAKER_18]: $300,000 in estimated receipts.

560
00:43:54,115 --> 00:43:55,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councilor Pantone.

561
00:43:56,035 --> 00:44:02,657
[SPEAKER_17]: That is absolutely not true, Mr. President, because the total cost of the program to put this in operation was less than a million dollars, number one.

562
00:44:02,717 --> 00:44:09,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, they've already taken over $440,000 in net profit from the last report that we got, and the city of Mifflin only got 32%.

563
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:09,839
[SPEAKER_17]: So if they got $442,000,

564
00:44:12,197 --> 00:44:15,138
[SPEAKER_17]: We got less than $200,000 out of that so far.

565
00:44:15,418 --> 00:44:17,559
[SPEAKER_17]: There are trade-offs in this particular contract.

566
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:22,761
[SPEAKER_17]: There have been violations in this contract by both sides, by Republic as well as the City of Medford.

567
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:31,284
[SPEAKER_17]: And the City of Medford has been equally negligent in not going forward either through the traffic commission or through resolutions of this council as it relates to the agreement.

568
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:38,267
[SPEAKER_17]: And lastly, and most importantly, all this Medford City Council ever did was to allow the mayor to go out and to negotiate with Republic

569
00:44:38,913 --> 00:44:48,622
[SPEAKER_17]: up to a 10-year contract, but at the same time to come back to the council and show us if the city of Medford was going to do it and what the cost factor would be before anything was done.

570
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:50,284
[SPEAKER_17]: The mayor never did that.

571
00:44:50,384 --> 00:44:51,745
[SPEAKER_17]: He went ahead and signed the contract

572
00:44:51,968 --> 00:44:57,432
[SPEAKER_17]: without coming back to the Medford City Council and explaining both in detail.

573
00:44:58,993 --> 00:45:01,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, I think the council is confused.

574
00:45:01,696 --> 00:45:09,261
[SPEAKER_18]: There's $300,000 that was in our fiscal year budget that we're operating right now, estimated receipts from this parking program.

575
00:45:09,522 --> 00:45:14,025
[SPEAKER_18]: So you take the $800,000 that's amortized for the actual equipment plus the $300,000

576
00:45:15,508 --> 00:45:19,169
[SPEAKER_18]: that is in estimated receipts, minus a quarter of the fiscal year.

577
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:26,250
[SPEAKER_18]: So rather than 1.1 million, it's probably around 1 million, say, to buy it outright right now.

578
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:34,992
[SPEAKER_18]: To say that the city council did not support it, we supported it on two occasions, seven to nothing vote, seven to nothing vote, loud and clear, it has to be that.

579
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:39,453
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor did have a thing with that, that it came back to the council.

580
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:42,134
[SPEAKER_18]: We met in this council office over here,

581
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:44,160
[SPEAKER_18]: before the mayor signed it.

582
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,043
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know the exact date, but we met in that council office.

583
00:45:47,583 --> 00:45:54,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Some of the people that are in the room this evening were at that meeting as well as a lot of other businesses throughout the community.

584
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:55,210
[SPEAKER_18]: The place was jammed.

585
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:56,171
[SPEAKER_18]: It was packed.

586
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:00,895
[SPEAKER_18]: We were actually going to move the meeting into the council chamber, but we couldn't because there was another meeting going on in here.

587
00:46:01,436 --> 00:46:03,478
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, it was a seven to nothing vote.

588
00:46:03,518 --> 00:46:05,760
[SPEAKER_18]: It's seven to nothing vote.

589
00:46:06,825 --> 00:46:09,306
[SPEAKER_17]: point of information, Councilor Penta.

590
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:14,408
[SPEAKER_17]: May 20th of 2014, Council Resolution 14472 offered by, before the City Council.

591
00:46:14,888 --> 00:46:29,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, the Medford City Council did agree to allow the Mayor to go forward, but also conditioned upon the fact that he would present himself back, present himself back with an in-house review as to what the cost would be on September 10th of 2014.

592
00:46:29,614 --> 00:46:31,275
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a Committee of the Whole meeting over there.

593
00:46:31,685 --> 00:46:40,368
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason why the Committee of the Whole meeting took place was, again, to explain that for which took place between May 20th up to September 14th, September 10th.

594
00:46:40,768 --> 00:46:43,929
[SPEAKER_17]: At that meeting, there was 30 to 40 business people at that meeting.

595
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:47,951
[SPEAKER_17]: And there was a pushback by the mayor because he didn't expect those people to be there.

596
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:56,874
[SPEAKER_17]: On October 10th, approximately one month later, the mayor came back and signed the contract without getting a vote of approval by the Medford City Council.

597
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:57,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

598
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:58,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are the records of this city.

599
00:46:58,894 --> 00:46:59,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Chair.

600
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:01,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, Councilor Cusack.

601
00:47:01,678 --> 00:47:04,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I said, the records of the Medford City Council don't lie.

602
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,419
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a seven to nothing vote.

603
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:08,280
[SPEAKER_18]: People can pretend they didn't vote for it, did vote for it, whatever.

604
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,501
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not gonna argue any more about it.

605
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:10,421
[SPEAKER_18]: It was seven to zip.

606
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:15,002
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone can go down to the city clerk's office, see the minutes of that particular meeting in question.

607
00:47:15,563 --> 00:47:16,703
[SPEAKER_18]: It was seven to nothing vote.

608
00:47:17,403 --> 00:47:18,784
[SPEAKER_18]: It only needed five votes.

609
00:47:19,804 --> 00:47:21,665
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it might have needed five or four.

610
00:47:22,345 --> 00:47:25,926
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not really sure because it was for up to 10 year contract.

611
00:47:25,946 --> 00:47:30,488
[SPEAKER_18]: Seven years up front, three years in the rear if the city decides to

612
00:47:31,794 --> 00:47:33,535
[SPEAKER_18]: renegotiate up to three years.

613
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:35,556
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was a seven to nothing vote.

614
00:47:36,076 --> 00:47:38,138
[SPEAKER_18]: And he mentioned the council resolution numbers.

615
00:47:38,198 --> 00:47:43,261
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyone out there that's watching can go down to the city clerk's office and see the vote of the council was unanimous.

616
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:48,424
[SPEAKER_18]: So, uh, that's a really, you can't, you can't beat the dead horse anymore.

617
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:50,725
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a seven to nothing vote of the Medford city council.

618
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:55,828
[SPEAKER_18]: It was actually one of the few times that we're actually all unanimous behind this rail.

619
00:47:56,988 --> 00:47:59,650
[SPEAKER_18]: As we know, we often vote, um, our separate ways and,

620
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:01,773
[SPEAKER_18]: That was one that everyone supported.

621
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:16,706
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a motion on the floor that has been amended several times and we're now going to hear from a couple more citizens who wish to speak on this and that we're going to put this to a vote, move on to the next agenda item.

622
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:19,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

623
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:20,069
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

624
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:21,910
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Michael Orgero.

625
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:23,672
[SPEAKER_19]: I live on 18 Pembroke street.

626
00:48:24,427 --> 00:48:28,410
[SPEAKER_19]: The first thing I want to address is a point that Councilor Knight brought up.

627
00:48:29,091 --> 00:48:35,936
[SPEAKER_19]: Many business owners are not able to attend the Traffic Commission meeting because it's during the day, and they are running their businesses.

628
00:48:36,716 --> 00:48:38,237
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had an informal poll.

629
00:48:38,277 --> 00:48:42,401
[SPEAKER_19]: I've had an opportunity to discuss the issue with a variety of different businesses.

630
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:44,242
[SPEAKER_19]: I have many on tape.

631
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:50,967
[SPEAKER_19]: About 80% of the businesses in Medford believe that the parking meters have hurt their business.

632
00:48:51,407 --> 00:48:51,928
[SPEAKER_19]: That's a fact.

633
00:48:52,983 --> 00:48:55,845
[SPEAKER_19]: About 10% say it hasn't really hurt, hasn't really helped.

634
00:48:56,546 --> 00:49:02,171
[SPEAKER_19]: The 10% that actually think it's helped their business would have preferred a system of just enforcing what we had.

635
00:49:02,751 --> 00:49:03,652
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's the first point.

636
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:07,415
[SPEAKER_19]: The hours of the traffic commission are not convenient for Jimmy's pizza.

637
00:49:07,495 --> 00:49:08,436
[SPEAKER_19]: He's making pizza.

638
00:49:09,837 --> 00:49:11,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

639
00:49:11,418 --> 00:49:16,263
[SPEAKER_14]: If I was losing 35% of my business, like Mr. Spiracus mentioned, I'd make time to go to the traffic commission.

640
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:17,423
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my livelihood.

641
00:49:17,443 --> 00:49:20,366
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the way that we provide to put food at our table for our families.

642
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:29,357
[SPEAKER_14]: If this is having this dramatic of an effect, you better believe I'm making the time to go down there and talk to the traffic commission or anybody else that's in charge of making these policy decisions that are going to affect my life in that fashion.

643
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:36,362
[SPEAKER_14]: So while the gentleman may feel as though the traffic commission structure and the times that they meet aren't necessarily convenient to him,

644
00:49:37,395 --> 00:49:38,916
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a mechanism of the traffic commission.

645
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:48,119
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure, I am sure that with a little outreach and a little communication with the traffic commission, they'll be willing to change that to maybe meet off hours, to maybe meet once a month, uh, late at night.

646
00:49:48,579 --> 00:49:52,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but you gotta ask the question, Mr. President, right now they meet at two o'clock once a month.

647
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,102
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure if we make the recommendation or we make a request, they will do that at a different, different times and different hours.

648
00:49:57,182 --> 00:49:59,903
[SPEAKER_14]: But keep in mind, if I was losing 35% a month in my business,

649
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,699
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be the first one down at the Traffic Commission.

650
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,683
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'd be able to afford to close the doors if, in fact, my business was being affected 35% negative.

651
00:50:09,103 --> 00:50:15,548
[SPEAKER_14]: To go down there and to talk to them.

652
00:50:15,668 --> 00:50:16,709
[SPEAKER_15]: I rest my point, Mr. President.

653
00:50:16,729 --> 00:50:17,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor.

654
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:18,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Please don't interrupt.

655
00:50:19,371 --> 00:50:25,996
[SPEAKER_19]: With all due respect to the Councilor, the fact that 80% of the businesses in Medford are losing business should be his concern.

656
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:28,292
[SPEAKER_19]: And he can make an easy recommendation.

657
00:50:28,312 --> 00:50:29,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

658
00:50:30,013 --> 00:50:33,894
[SPEAKER_14]: An informal poll from a gentleman that walked around and knocked on doors isn't statistical analysis.

659
00:50:34,754 --> 00:50:35,834
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information as well.

660
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:37,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

661
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:50,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Based upon the reports that we got from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue as well, as recent as a couple of months ago, the sales and meals tax has jumped dramatically from last year.

662
00:50:51,177 --> 00:50:54,438
[SPEAKER_18]: So unless the price of meals is double or whatever is going on,

663
00:50:55,658 --> 00:50:58,760
[SPEAKER_18]: That's actual statistical data from the Department of Revenue.

664
00:51:00,762 --> 00:51:12,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Beyond these two points, in this perhaps squabbling environment, going to these traffic, listening to this conversation about traffic over and over again, I'm reminded about those cartoons with Wile E. Coyote.

665
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:19,813
[SPEAKER_19]: where you have the coyote chasing roadrunner and the background keeps changing, but everyone really knows there's no movement.

666
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:22,094
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just the background keeps swinging around.

667
00:51:22,974 --> 00:51:27,596
[SPEAKER_19]: Ultimately, this problem boils down to the way that we have written our charter.

668
00:51:28,256 --> 00:51:30,256
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to review our charter.

669
00:51:30,777 --> 00:51:40,460
[SPEAKER_19]: Currently, my team is circulating the petition to actually have the charter reviewed, so mysterious contracts cannot be signed in the middle of night without prior approval of the city.

670
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

671
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record, sir.

672
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:54,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

673
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:55,431
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, everybody.

674
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:57,691
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm Jim Bilodeau, Guild Street, Medford.

675
00:51:58,092 --> 00:52:01,212
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd just like to say something about the parking field program.

676
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:18,256
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to say something about the field parking, Republic parking program from Tennessee.

677
00:52:19,392 --> 00:52:30,380
[SPEAKER_23]: people getting tickets before operating hours and after operating hours, and on holidays, and also people with handicapped parking permits also getting tickets.

678
00:52:31,021 --> 00:52:41,748
[SPEAKER_23]: Businesses is way down wherever the kiosks are, and sometimes using your charge card does not record correctly, and you get a ticket.

679
00:52:42,309 --> 00:52:44,390
[SPEAKER_23]: From the Republic, money thieves.

680
00:52:45,391 --> 00:52:49,134
[SPEAKER_23]: We need an in-house Medford fare parking program.

681
00:52:50,558 --> 00:53:01,180
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, I would like, like noted in the Medford transcript newspaper on Thursday, July 23rd, McGovern's handpicked candidate.

682
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:03,761
[SPEAKER_23]: She stated that we have no right.

683
00:53:04,101 --> 00:53:04,641
[SPEAKER_23]: Listen to this.

684
00:53:04,661 --> 00:53:08,522
[SPEAKER_23]: You're going to look at the paper and it's proof on the 23rd.

685
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:16,344
[SPEAKER_23]: She states, we have no right to be here in the city council meeting and talking about the field kiosk parking program.

686
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,744
[SPEAKER_23]: if you are not licensed to practice law in the state of Massachusetts.

687
00:53:22,284 --> 00:53:24,166
[SPEAKER_23]: It's in the paper, and she stated that.

688
00:53:24,706 --> 00:53:25,447
[SPEAKER_23]: It's on record.

689
00:53:26,047 --> 00:53:29,550
[SPEAKER_23]: I just want to say that this is the United States of America.

690
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:32,772
[SPEAKER_23]: We have a constitutional right to this.

691
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:36,475
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a democracy, and we have freedom of speech.

692
00:53:37,216 --> 00:53:37,596
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

693
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:38,817
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you all.

694
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Chimney.

695
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:48,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to disagree with Mr. Camuso.

696
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:54,257
[SPEAKER_04]: I know for a long, long time, and said he was to school across the street.

697
00:53:55,378 --> 00:53:59,140
[SPEAKER_04]: And revenues, I don't think they've gone up in this city.

698
00:54:00,461 --> 00:54:01,782
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't believe.

699
00:54:02,343 --> 00:54:04,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to see an increase.

700
00:54:04,465 --> 00:54:09,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I know fact, and I know I spoke about nine people, businessmen, in Medford.

701
00:54:10,249 --> 00:54:15,173
[SPEAKER_04]: The business was about 18 to 22 percent down this moment.

702
00:54:16,912 --> 00:54:25,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have, you know, my son Costa, he's got a friend in Winchester, Arlington, Gooben, okay?

703
00:54:25,697 --> 00:54:27,258
[SPEAKER_04]: The sales, they're going up 8, 9% in Winchester.

704
00:54:27,278 --> 00:54:28,239
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive last week 130.

705
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:37,492
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like a bazaar in downtown Winchester.

706
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:39,573
[SPEAKER_04]: People in and out of the stores.

707
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:41,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I parked for 10 minutes, and I look around.

708
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:44,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I come back to West Medford.

709
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:44,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It was dead.

710
00:54:45,036 --> 00:54:45,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.

711
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:48,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Only I see three cars on the ice cream place.

712
00:54:48,458 --> 00:54:49,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody else.

713
00:54:50,419 --> 00:54:51,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody else.

714
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:53,141
[SPEAKER_04]: No businesses.

715
00:54:54,402 --> 00:54:58,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I go, Mr. Covington, to pick up vegetables, Roberto's place.

716
00:54:59,325 --> 00:55:00,785
[SPEAKER_04]: He says to me, Jimmy, how's business?

717
00:55:01,286 --> 00:55:02,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Three days ago.

718
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:03,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I says, terrible.

719
00:55:03,813 --> 00:55:06,075
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just — I don't know if I'm going to make it.

720
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:11,358
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, new owners bought it from, I don't know, a couple of years ago.

721
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:13,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just — it's scary.

722
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Business very often.

723
00:55:18,503 --> 00:55:20,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think the revenue is going up.

724
00:55:21,645 --> 00:55:27,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And, again, you have to look very serious, because another year, I don't know, this city, what's going to happen.

725
00:55:28,109 --> 00:55:32,632
[SPEAKER_18]: The Press Jimmy, just so you know, the number I'm basing it off of is the revenue that

726
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:38,266
[SPEAKER_18]: The city of Medford gets back from the Department of Revenue based upon the sales of male's tax.

727
00:55:38,527 --> 00:55:39,887
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the number that went up significantly.

728
00:55:40,067 --> 00:55:40,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to get you the numbers.

729
00:55:40,888 --> 00:55:41,848
[SPEAKER_18]: I can bring, I got it.

730
00:55:42,148 --> 00:55:43,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe not your business, I'm talking citywide.

731
00:55:44,329 --> 00:55:45,690
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get you the numbers, I'll bring them in your store.

732
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you talking about Chrysler?

733
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:49,772
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, male's tax.

734
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:50,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

735
00:55:50,552 --> 00:55:51,333
[SPEAKER_04]: Volkswagen?

736
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:52,013
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll bring it in to you.

737
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:54,935
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about small businesses, you know?

738
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I will bring the numbers in to you, I will do that.

739
00:55:56,855 --> 00:55:57,716
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to see that.

740
00:55:57,776 --> 00:55:58,776
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get last year's and this year's.

741
00:55:58,796 --> 00:56:00,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can give you every week?

742
00:56:00,551 --> 00:56:02,693
[SPEAKER_18]: every month, state, for my business.

743
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:03,413
[SPEAKER_18]: I can print.

744
00:56:03,714 --> 00:56:04,994
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just talking citywide, Jimmy.

745
00:56:05,335 --> 00:56:05,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

746
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:08,037
[SPEAKER_18]: There might have been more restaurants that started.

747
00:56:09,258 --> 00:56:11,159
[SPEAKER_18]: Please state your name and address for the record, sir.

748
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:11,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

749
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Steven Figalski, 72 Butler Street, Malden.

750
00:56:15,222 --> 00:56:18,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently I work for the Department of Public Works.

751
00:56:19,205 --> 00:56:21,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Camuso may be right about the meal tax.

752
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:27,532
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, is there any kiosks at Station Landings where most of the restaurants are?

753
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:32,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

754
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:33,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

755
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:37,855
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Council Lungo-Koehn, all those in favour?

756
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:37,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

757
00:56:40,198 --> 00:56:40,778
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended?

758
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:40,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

759
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:42,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Several times.

760
00:56:42,781 --> 00:56:43,702
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

761
00:56:43,722 --> 00:56:45,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

762
00:56:59,185 --> 00:57:03,367
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for suspension of the rules by Vice President Lungo-Koehn, all those in favor?

763
00:57:03,947 --> 00:57:04,688
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

764
00:57:05,448 --> 00:57:06,949
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

765
00:57:07,229 --> 00:57:09,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to take 15-561 out of order.

766
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:18,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Petition by Louise Morales, 61 Shore Drive, Somerville, Mass., to address the council on the issues with Chevalier Theater.

767
00:57:19,755 --> 00:57:21,175
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the petitioner present?

768
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:23,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Louise Morales.

769
00:57:24,177 --> 00:57:26,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

770
00:57:26,198 --> 00:57:26,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

771
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:30,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Luis Morales, 61 Shore Drive, Somerville, Massachusetts.

772
00:57:36,138 --> 00:57:42,300
[SPEAKER_12]: I was here two years ago, I remember some of you, because I was kicked out of the Chevalier Theater.

773
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:55,763
[SPEAKER_12]: And as a product of coming here in front of you guys, I was called two days later to, they called me to let me know that they were gonna continue to rent me the theater.

774
00:57:57,567 --> 00:58:03,010
[SPEAKER_12]: The discussion at that time was that a church could not have a service at the Chevalier Theater.

775
00:58:04,831 --> 00:58:16,817
[SPEAKER_12]: But everything was going so-so for two years, even though I continued to be kind of harassed by John Costas almost every night.

776
00:58:18,138 --> 00:58:19,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information, Councilor Knight?

777
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:24,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking at the underlying petition here, and what the petitioner

778
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:29,522
[SPEAKER_14]: has written down versus what's shown up in the agenda are two very different items, Mr. President.

779
00:58:31,923 --> 00:58:41,187
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that this is something that should be handled a little bit more sensitively than we are at this point in time, based upon what I'm seeing here, Mr. President.

780
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:53,093
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my understanding that in certain instances, if a person's reputation is on the line, that that individual does have the right to appear before the council, or they also have the option to meet with an executive session.

781
00:58:53,490 --> 00:59:01,034
[SPEAKER_14]: to determine whether or not it's appropriate for the public forum, I think we might need to have an opinion from our city solicitor before we go any further, Mr. President.

782
00:59:01,434 --> 00:59:04,976
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very troubling what I'm reading here on the petition signed September 11th, 2015.

783
00:59:05,937 --> 00:59:17,943
[SPEAKER_14]: A very delicate concern that we have about the way a certain individual that's a member of the Chevalier Commission is treating us at the Chevalier Theater just because we are not white people and we are from a different religion.

784
00:59:18,678 --> 00:59:27,820
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that that alone, Mr. President, would warrant us to at least err on the side of caution and allow the city solicitor to give us an opinion as to whether or not this is an appropriate matter for executive session.

785
00:59:28,441 --> 00:59:36,363
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a city employee who's been named by name in a derogatory fashion, and I feel as though if this goes any further, it may be damaging to his reputation.

786
00:59:36,843 --> 00:59:45,125
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also feel as though he should have the right to at least get an opinion from council as to whether or not the appropriate forum to hear this would be here or an executive session, Mr. President.

787
00:59:45,967 --> 00:59:50,890
[SPEAKER_15]: So in light of that point of order, Councilor, do you have a motion for us?

788
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:54,051
[SPEAKER_15]: My motion would be to lay the matter on the table until we can receive an opinion from the solicitor.

789
00:59:54,752 --> 01:00:05,658
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to lay this matter on the table, pending a opinion from the city solicitor, a motion to table a matter is unavailable.

790
01:00:06,938 --> 01:00:11,401
[SPEAKER_15]: So this motion on the motion of Councilor Knight to table, all those in favor?

791
01:00:12,603 --> 01:00:13,343
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

792
01:00:14,283 --> 01:00:15,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

793
01:00:15,764 --> 01:00:28,487
[SPEAKER_15]: The matter is now tabled and the city council will seek recommendations from the city solicitor on how to proceed on this matter.

794
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:38,369
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor already read what delicate condition has been placed in the petition that could be regarded as a serious charge against someone.

795
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:42,310
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor read that and he met with me and John Costas.

796
01:00:43,403 --> 01:00:45,545
[SPEAKER_12]: We already had a meeting with the mayor.

797
01:00:45,985 --> 01:00:47,206
[SPEAKER_15]: The matter is tabled.

798
01:00:47,246 --> 01:00:48,567
[SPEAKER_15]: We can no longer discuss it.

799
01:00:54,011 --> 01:00:57,793
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn to revert back to the regular order business.

800
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:07,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knights comments that this has not been issued with level of sensitivity.

801
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:09,802
[SPEAKER_16]: I was here two years ago.

802
01:01:11,112 --> 01:01:21,859
[SPEAKER_15]: We have this, I'm afraid this matter is tabled, so it's been placed on the table and the rules of the council would prohibit us from continuing this discussion as the matter is tabled.

803
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,260
[SPEAKER_15]: My sincerest apologies.

804
01:01:27,362 --> 01:01:36,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, it's a sad commentary on the way this is being handled because it's been two years now and sensitivity is really an ironic word for you to use, Adam, because

805
01:01:40,631 --> 01:01:45,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if I may.

806
01:01:46,714 --> 01:01:48,915
[SPEAKER_14]: My concern is nothing more than a city employee.

807
01:01:48,935 --> 01:01:50,435
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion has been tabled.

808
01:01:51,296 --> 01:01:52,676
[SPEAKER_15]: The motion has been tabled.

809
01:01:52,696 --> 01:01:53,657
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all right.

810
01:01:53,677 --> 01:01:59,839
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Longo, turn to return to the regular order of business.

811
01:01:59,939 --> 01:02:00,940
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor.

812
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,421
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, while we're in the suspension, I just have one announcement.

813
01:02:03,441 --> 01:02:04,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that good?

814
01:02:04,901 --> 01:02:06,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, by remarks.

815
01:02:07,253 --> 01:02:08,895
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

816
01:02:09,395 --> 01:02:12,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to commend and congratulate Patrick Coughlin.

817
01:02:13,338 --> 01:02:19,702
[SPEAKER_05]: He is a local resident here, and he just graduated from boot camp for the U.S.

818
01:02:19,742 --> 01:02:23,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Marines on September 4th in Parris Island in South Carolina.

819
01:02:24,246 --> 01:02:32,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And Patrick has made his mother and father very proud and has served this community very proud, Mr. President.

820
01:02:33,353 --> 01:02:36,276
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to wish him well on all his future endeavors.

821
01:02:36,516 --> 01:02:37,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Semper fi, Mr. Coffey.

822
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:38,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

823
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,138
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

824
01:02:39,598 --> 01:02:42,841
[SPEAKER_15]: On motion of Councilor Marks for that, congratulations.

825
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:43,642
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

826
01:02:43,662 --> 01:02:44,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

827
01:02:44,342 --> 01:02:45,043
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

828
01:02:45,123 --> 01:02:46,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

829
01:02:46,284 --> 01:02:50,067
[SPEAKER_15]: On motion of Vice President Lagocurin to revert back to the order of regular order of business.

830
01:02:50,147 --> 01:02:50,908
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

831
01:02:50,928 --> 01:02:51,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

832
01:02:51,488 --> 01:02:52,249
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

833
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:54,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Carries.

834
01:02:54,591 --> 01:02:55,912
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-650 offered by Councilor Penta.

835
01:02:56,452 --> 01:03:02,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford Square bus stops being impacted by the refurbishing of the Craddock Bridge

836
01:03:02,565 --> 01:03:06,967
[SPEAKER_15]: be addressed as major traffic and safety problems are emanating.

837
01:03:08,948 --> 01:03:14,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Penta will catch our breath for one moment.

838
01:03:29,577 --> 01:03:32,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe my inflection on reading the motion was a little

839
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:43,344
[SPEAKER_15]: off, be it resolved that the Medford Square bus stops being impacted by the refurbishing of the Craddock Bridge be addressed as major traffic and safety problems are emanating.

840
01:03:43,704 --> 01:03:44,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

841
01:03:48,366 --> 01:03:57,869
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, this resolution is brought forward because, as we all know, as you traverse through Medford Square and as of some point in time during this late summer,

842
01:03:58,523 --> 01:04:05,484
[SPEAKER_17]: We've seen construction taking place here in Renfrew Square as it relates to the Craddock Bridge or the refurbishing of the Craddock Bridge.

843
01:04:06,205 --> 01:04:12,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we know it's a 121-foot bridge, and we know that we've been told it's going to take approximately two and a half years to get itself refurbished.

844
01:04:13,406 --> 01:04:18,027
[SPEAKER_17]: The unfortunate part of the two and a half years is that this is not an everyday, six-day-a-week project.

845
01:04:18,547 --> 01:04:23,208
[SPEAKER_17]: In any one given week, you may be working two days, three days, four days, for whatever it might be.

846
01:04:23,668 --> 01:04:28,069
[SPEAKER_17]: And unfortunately, in the contract, there's nothing that demands that they have to be there on a daily basis

847
01:04:28,536 --> 01:04:31,477
[SPEAKER_17]: six days a week, working double time, as the contract said it would.

848
01:04:32,297 --> 01:04:42,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, we see there is an ongoing traffic congestion and a traffic public safety problem with the buses that are now stopping on Main Street in downtown Medford Square.

849
01:04:43,761 --> 01:04:55,344
[SPEAKER_17]: And since, in fact, there has to be some changes, because the sidewalks are going to be getting dug up, the street is going to have to be refurbished over there on the odd side of the street, something has to give.

850
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:58,225
[SPEAKER_17]: And what's going to have to give is the public buses,

851
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:03,482
[SPEAKER_17]: that traverse over there because there is no way that they can make a reasonable public safety stop.

852
01:05:04,243 --> 01:05:20,955
[SPEAKER_17]: My recommendation would be, since the city council is the only one that can move to change or recommend to change bus stops, is to put those buses all on Medford Square that would stop there, change the direction of River Street instead of coming down and have it go left so it takes you right back to Salem Street and then it goes around.

853
01:05:21,548 --> 01:05:24,529
[SPEAKER_17]: I've spoken with many senior citizens from 121 and 99.

854
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:32,290
[SPEAKER_17]: There is no way that they want to walk down that new ring road, cross under the bridge, to go to the bus stop if it's going to be moved over there.

855
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:40,631
[SPEAKER_17]: That walk, especially in the winter, especially if the inclement weather, snow or raining, it would just put them right out of business, physically, so to speak.

856
01:05:41,652 --> 01:05:49,413
[SPEAKER_17]: So by putting those buses in Main Street, instead of coming and taking the ride on Main Street like they do, all they would do would be just going into Medford Square,

857
01:05:49,827 --> 01:05:51,288
[SPEAKER_17]: They would be going to River Street.

858
01:05:51,308 --> 01:06:02,757
[SPEAKER_17]: You'd be opening up the parking spaces on the right-hand side, on the Dainty Donut side, and you would just probably add maybe another three to four minutes on a bus route, but so be it, because something's going to have to give.

859
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:16,467
[SPEAKER_17]: So to make sure that everybody's on board with this so there's an understanding, Mr. President, I'm going to recommend that we have a committee of the whole so we have a sense of transparency and openness as it relates to not only this particular issue, to let's look at all the ideas that need to be discussed.

860
01:06:16,898 --> 01:06:18,479
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be my recommendation right now.

861
01:06:18,499 --> 01:06:21,841
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what's speaking from business owners and from people who traverse those bus stops.

862
01:06:22,382 --> 01:06:24,483
[SPEAKER_17]: But again, this needs to be done sooner than later.

863
01:06:24,503 --> 01:06:36,491
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm going to ask you, Mr. President, within the next two weeks to call for a Committee of the Whole meeting and to also call someone from the Department of Transportation, also someone from the MBTA, as well as our own Office of Community Development.

864
01:06:36,651 --> 01:06:38,573
[SPEAKER_17]: And I welcome that, and it's important.

865
01:06:38,613 --> 01:06:46,278
[SPEAKER_15]: But can I, just by way of reminder, point out to you that the biggest obstacle we had when we addressed this the last time

866
01:06:46,788 --> 01:06:53,674
[SPEAKER_15]: was our friends from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, who we give an awful lot of money every year.

867
01:06:53,714 --> 01:06:57,557
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we're either the third or the fourth highest user within its system.

868
01:06:57,857 --> 01:07:07,826
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is one time, if you remember correctly, because I do, because I have my notes, the last time we had this meeting, there was one lady who allegedly stated that she was the only one that was in charge of reviewing these bus stops.

869
01:07:08,286 --> 01:07:09,527
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't make the decision.

870
01:07:09,787 --> 01:07:12,610
[SPEAKER_17]: The Medford City Council makes the decision on bus stops.

871
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,931
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, Mr. President,

872
01:07:15,825 --> 01:07:17,406
[SPEAKER_17]: without being repetitious, and they won't be.

873
01:07:17,927 --> 01:07:23,251
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other sad part about this whole thing, it's already impacting businesses in the downtown Medford Square area.

874
01:07:23,732 --> 01:07:25,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we've been told that there was no mitigation.

875
01:07:25,714 --> 01:07:27,215
[SPEAKER_17]: Mitigation is not an available item.

876
01:07:27,275 --> 01:07:28,476
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's absolutely not true.

877
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:41,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Because if this bridge is going to eventually put people out of business or put people to the point of going into bankruptcy, then, you know, there is a need to have that whole thought process take place, even though it's a state contract.

878
01:07:41,867 --> 01:07:43,609
[SPEAKER_17]: The state contract has subcontractors.

879
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:54,885
[SPEAKER_17]: And the subcontractors have to be held liable, just like they were on the FAST 14 when they did the bridges a few years ago, the 14 bridges, 14 weeks in a row, and they put them up over a weekend.

880
01:07:55,385 --> 01:08:10,634
[SPEAKER_17]: So, without going into that, and the other part I'd like to have, Mr. President, is have our city engineer report back to the council that since, in fact, they're building that portable bridge that's going to go over, they're pounding into the ground the structure to hold the

881
01:08:12,745 --> 01:08:14,806
[SPEAKER_17]: the bridge and the arch of the bridge going across.

882
01:08:15,407 --> 01:08:23,232
[SPEAKER_17]: What impact, if anything, is that having on those buildings that abut not only the waterways, but the waterways in and of itself?

883
01:08:23,612 --> 01:08:26,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't forget, that bridge has been there for well in excess of 100 years.

884
01:08:26,474 --> 01:08:29,036
[SPEAKER_17]: It's built a solid granite, hasn't sunk an inch.

885
01:08:29,516 --> 01:08:32,298
[SPEAKER_17]: The only thing that's sunk an inch is the downtown Medford Square area.

886
01:08:33,058 --> 01:08:38,382
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, building upon that granite, which the foundation is already there, yes, it's a cost savings.

887
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:46,213
[SPEAKER_17]: But you've gone from $3 million up to almost $11.8 million to build a bridge that's 121 feet, and they're telling you it's taken two and a half years.

888
01:08:46,753 --> 01:08:56,457
[SPEAKER_17]: So if it's taken two and a half years to build it, and they're not building it each and every day, six days a week, double-shift days, then that's the reason why it's taken two and a half years.

889
01:08:56,518 --> 01:09:04,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Because these companies, subcontractors and major companies, basically are doing other jobs, and probably legitimately so.

890
01:09:07,538 --> 01:09:12,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Because there's nothing in the contract that mandates that they do that job each and every day.

891
01:09:12,839 --> 01:09:15,840
[SPEAKER_17]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd like to move the question.

892
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Call for that in two weeks, please.

893
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:20,081
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion as amended by Councilor Penta.

894
01:09:20,501 --> 01:09:26,262
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also point out that part of the mitigation plan for construction was ongoing vibration monitoring.

895
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:27,322
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

896
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:28,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

897
01:09:30,376 --> 01:09:32,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to agree with my council colleague.

898
01:09:32,578 --> 01:09:40,383
[SPEAKER_18]: The traffic is starting to get pretty rough down there, especially during the commuting hours, five o'clock early in the morning.

899
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:46,588
[SPEAKER_18]: The fact of the matter is this is a state, Department of Transportation is overseeing this project.

900
01:09:47,489 --> 01:09:53,433
[SPEAKER_18]: I asked for the MBTA to come forward with a solution within the last three months or so, I believe it was.

901
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:58,977
[SPEAKER_18]: We still have not heard back from them on that particular item.

902
01:09:59,378 --> 01:10:12,507
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's obvious that something has to be done because people shouldn't be expected to wait for a bus and be breathing in the debris, whether it's jackhammering and things of that nature.

903
01:10:13,608 --> 01:10:17,851
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think something has to be done, whether it be temporary or a more permanent solution.

904
01:10:19,912 --> 01:10:23,575
[SPEAKER_18]: But definitely something has to give on this particular situation.

905
01:10:24,115 --> 01:10:26,677
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could have them in to discuss this,

906
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:36,422
[SPEAKER_18]: Also to discuss some of the express buses that so many Medford residents in this community rely upon to get to work every day into Boston.

907
01:10:37,564 --> 01:10:40,348
[SPEAKER_18]: They're the subject right now of privatization.

908
01:10:41,093 --> 01:10:58,338
[SPEAKER_18]: with the MBTA, and I'd like to just get a status on where they're going and if the service is going to be as good, because quite honestly, I think the 326 and the 325 bus operated right now does a tremendous, brings tremendous value to our community.

909
01:10:58,898 --> 01:11:01,399
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's on time.

910
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:03,280
[SPEAKER_18]: It's packed.

911
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:07,321
[SPEAKER_18]: The express buses are packed every single morning going into Boston.

912
01:11:07,748 --> 01:11:09,129
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd like to hear their plans.

913
01:11:09,169 --> 01:11:11,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe I'll put that on at a later meeting.

914
01:11:12,331 --> 01:11:16,414
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a separate issue because the bridge is more time consuming now.

915
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:18,916
[SPEAKER_18]: And I do support the councillor.

916
01:11:18,936 --> 01:11:21,038
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm going to withdraw that at this time.

917
01:11:21,618 --> 01:11:25,241
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm going to bring it forward in a later motion.

918
01:11:25,761 --> 01:11:26,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

919
01:11:26,281 --> 01:11:27,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

920
01:11:27,842 --> 01:11:29,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso took the words right out of my mouth.

921
01:11:29,984 --> 01:11:34,607
[SPEAKER_14]: As someone who takes the 325 bus quite often, I feel it's the only bus I can take that's ever on time.

922
01:11:34,747 --> 01:11:36,629
[SPEAKER_14]: And from what I understand now, there are plans

923
01:11:37,614 --> 01:11:41,277
[SPEAKER_14]: all to the personnel, privatize the route, and what have you.

924
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:51,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Although Councilor Camuso was gracious enough to withdraw his amendment, I feel as though if we're going to be bringing MassDOT down here and the MBTA down here,

925
01:11:51,664 --> 01:11:58,050
[SPEAKER_14]: that it's totally appropriate and, quite frankly, necessary that we find out what's going on with these buses as well.

926
01:11:58,371 --> 01:12:00,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not saying that just because I take it once a week.

927
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:15,408
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm saying that because when I sit there out my window, when I see people get on this bus, like my neighbor Chrissy and her two children that get on the bus every day, I have concerns about who's going to be operating these buses, where they're going to actually effectuate this cost savings, whether or not the service levels are still going to remain the same.

928
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:21,988
[SPEAKER_14]: So, Councilor Camuso, I concur with your opinion that, you know, we definitely need to take a look at the express buses.

929
01:12:22,809 --> 01:12:26,052
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I do not concur with your opinion that we can do it later.

930
01:12:26,072 --> 01:12:27,233
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to do it now.

931
01:12:27,713 --> 01:12:30,555
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this is a two-year construction project that's going on.

932
01:12:30,896 --> 01:12:33,538
[SPEAKER_14]: This privatization effort is going to be happening much sooner than that.

933
01:12:33,618 --> 01:12:36,701
[SPEAKER_14]: So, time is of the essence on both matters.

934
01:12:37,081 --> 01:12:39,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I commend Councilor Penta for bringing this issue forward.

935
01:12:39,882 --> 01:12:44,424
[SPEAKER_14]: I, too, have a number of concerns about the traffic flow patterns in Medford Square, where the bus stops are located.

936
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:50,866
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think if we're really serious about revitalization of our downtowns, these are some things that we need to look at, Mr. President.

937
01:12:50,886 --> 01:12:52,326
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you, Councilor Camuso.

938
01:12:52,346 --> 01:12:53,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

939
01:12:54,007 --> 01:12:56,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I move for approval as amended.

940
01:12:57,388 --> 01:13:00,569
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion for approval as amended, all those in favor?

941
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:02,009
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

942
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:03,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

943
01:13:05,686 --> 01:13:07,807
[SPEAKER_15]: To accept that this is going to be another item on the agenda.

944
01:13:07,827 --> 01:13:09,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Our next item is 15652, 653, and there's one under suspension if we could indulge me.

945
01:13:09,669 --> 01:13:10,189
[SPEAKER_15]: 656, all condolences.

946
01:13:25,755 --> 01:13:31,718
[SPEAKER_15]: offered by Councilor Caraviello, so we're going to read through them and move them as one.

947
01:13:32,499 --> 01:13:41,064
[SPEAKER_15]: So on 15-652 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer condolences to the family of Martin Conserva.

948
01:13:41,664 --> 01:13:47,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Conserva was the owner of Broadway Piano on Main Street and was active in many community organizations.

949
01:13:47,827 --> 01:13:50,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Conserva served our country in the Korean War.

950
01:13:51,089 --> 01:13:52,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Caraviello,

951
01:13:53,184 --> 01:13:58,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer condolences to the family of Wallace Counts on his recent passing.

952
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:09,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Wally held many positions in the city of Medford, federal government, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, along with several positions with various community organizations.

953
01:14:10,372 --> 01:14:11,853
[SPEAKER_15]: He was a veteran of the Korean War.

954
01:14:12,233 --> 01:14:15,455
[SPEAKER_15]: His presence in our community will be sorely missed.

955
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:19,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I ask for tonight's meeting to be held in his honor.

956
01:14:19,817 --> 01:14:21,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Finally, offered by Councilor Caraviello,

957
01:14:22,068 --> 01:14:29,552
[SPEAKER_15]: it be resolved that Medford City Council offer condolences to the family of Bud Mulcahy on his recent passing.

958
01:14:30,752 --> 01:14:34,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Bud was a World War II veteran and served at the Battle of Iwo Jima.

959
01:14:35,054 --> 01:14:37,436
[SPEAKER_15]: His presence in our community will be missed.

960
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:41,237
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could all rise for, did you want to speak?

961
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:41,898
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

962
01:14:42,798 --> 01:14:44,439
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could, I'm sorry, I apologize, Councilor.

963
01:14:44,619 --> 01:14:47,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

964
01:14:47,781 --> 01:14:50,262
[SPEAKER_06]: All three of these men served our country.

965
01:14:51,231 --> 01:14:53,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Balcaia served in Iwo Jima.

966
01:14:54,054 --> 01:14:58,819
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, three more veterans of our community have passed away in the last couple of weeks.

967
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:02,243
[SPEAKER_15]: And all great citizens who committed themselves to our community.

968
01:15:11,815 --> 01:15:15,356
[SPEAKER_06]: If the meeting be held in memory of Mr. Counts this evening, I'd appreciate that.

969
01:15:15,376 --> 01:15:15,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

970
01:15:16,216 --> 01:15:22,677
[SPEAKER_15]: And recommended that this meeting be held in memory of Mr. Counts.

971
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:29,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

972
01:15:29,218 --> 01:15:39,060
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-647, petition for reversal of sign denial by Philadelphia sign agent Heather Hopkins Dutko for AC Hotels Marriott

973
01:15:40,353 --> 01:15:56,938
[SPEAKER_15]: 95 station landing method, OCD application, 2015-20A exceeds allowable square footage for primary signs, 2015-20D application exceeds number of allowed secondary signs.

974
01:15:58,758 --> 01:16:05,940
[SPEAKER_15]: This went to the chairman of the committee for

975
01:16:07,858 --> 01:16:08,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Signs.

976
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:10,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's got that?

977
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:11,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Penta.

978
01:16:12,922 --> 01:16:13,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Knight?

979
01:16:14,162 --> 01:16:15,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Signs or licensure?

980
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:16,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Signs.

981
01:16:16,764 --> 01:16:17,485
[SPEAKER_15]: Signs.

982
01:16:18,185 --> 01:16:19,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks has signs.

983
01:16:20,227 --> 01:16:25,130
[SPEAKER_15]: The petitioner's presence, please kindly share with us your name and address for the record.

984
01:16:31,553 --> 01:16:32,193
[SPEAKER_09]: That's better.

985
01:16:32,434 --> 01:16:32,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

986
01:16:33,374 --> 01:16:33,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

987
01:16:33,854 --> 01:16:34,955
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Heather Dudco.

988
01:16:35,175 --> 01:16:40,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm at 27 Old Meeting House Road in Auburn, Mass for the record, and I'm representing Philadelphia Sign.

989
01:16:40,778 --> 01:16:49,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And also with me tonight... Evan Tormey with XSS Hotels, 108 Jones Avenue in Fort Smith, New Hampshire, representing the hotel developer.

990
01:16:51,204 --> 01:16:52,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are before the council tonight.

991
01:16:54,387 --> 01:16:54,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

992
01:16:57,490 --> 01:17:07,257
[SPEAKER_07]: AC Hotels Marriott is working with Philadelphia Sign and they seek approval for two wall signs that have been denied by planning and zoning due to non-conformance to the city of Medford zoning ordinance.

993
01:17:08,078 --> 01:17:15,003
[SPEAKER_07]: AC Hotels presented a comprehensive sign application package posing six wall signs on three facades of the building.

994
01:17:15,684 --> 01:17:16,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Four of the signs were approved.

995
01:17:17,571 --> 01:17:24,217
[SPEAKER_07]: However, two signs, each on the north elevation, were denied due to non-performance, and the denials were attached in our application.

996
01:17:25,158 --> 01:17:32,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Sign A, in particular, exceeds the square footage allowed for primary sign, and sign D exceeds the number allowed for secondary signage.

997
01:17:34,026 --> 01:17:43,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Provided with our brief is an overview of all six signs, A through F, proposed, so the council will have a comprehensive view of the total sign package that we presented.

998
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:53,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Tormey also has some nice large photo renderings that will give a better view of the proposed signage and the elevations, because our packets were pretty small.

999
01:17:54,793 --> 01:18:06,816
[SPEAKER_07]: AC Hotels feels that the building is in a unique situation due to all four sides of the hotel facing either a street or a parking lot, and that's why the number of signs were requested.

1000
01:18:07,636 --> 01:18:13,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a need for appropriate sized signage for visibility for fast-moving vehicles and the access roads.

1001
01:18:14,696 --> 01:18:22,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Coupled with the fact that this is a new building with large, high facades, we feel the proposed signage is appropriate for the facades they are proposed on.

1002
01:18:23,523 --> 01:18:28,227
[SPEAKER_07]: The proposed signage is tastefully designed and will be properly installed and maintained.

1003
01:18:28,687 --> 01:18:36,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Approving the signage does not diminish from the intent of the bylaw, which allows for multiple wall signs, and will not pose any public safety issues.

1004
01:18:37,054 --> 01:18:44,320
[SPEAKER_07]: By approving the additional two wall signs, AC Hotels feels that the new facility will be properly signed, ensuring safe arrival for guests to the hotel,

1005
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:48,742
[SPEAKER_07]: and therefore ensuring the hotel's success in Medford.

1006
01:18:48,782 --> 01:18:52,305
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do have a couple of renderings here.

1007
01:18:52,366 --> 01:18:56,109
[SPEAKER_08]: This perspective is from station landing looking to the southwest.

1008
01:18:56,469 --> 01:18:58,911
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the main entrance of the hotel that you can see here.

1009
01:18:59,572 --> 01:19:04,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is some signage proposed that's within the sign bylaw on the canopy.

1010
01:19:04,736 --> 01:19:08,860
[SPEAKER_08]: The larger sign on the upper facade is one of the signs, sign A in question.

1011
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:12,463
[SPEAKER_08]: The other sign in question is on the far side of this rendering.

1012
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:16,239
[SPEAKER_08]: That is facing north, visible to southbound traffic on 28.

1013
01:19:16,659 --> 01:19:23,301
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have some renderings of other perspectives of the building.

1014
01:19:23,321 --> 01:19:27,302
[SPEAKER_08]: The other signs are located on the west elevation, as well as the south elevation.

1015
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:28,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, visible from 28.

1016
01:19:33,944 --> 01:19:34,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Vice President.

1017
01:19:35,745 --> 01:19:36,025
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1018
01:19:36,334 --> 01:19:40,735
[SPEAKER_11]: President Teller, so the two that have been denied, the A and the D, are both on that?

1019
01:19:40,835 --> 01:19:41,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

1020
01:19:41,195 --> 01:19:41,475
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

1021
01:19:41,655 --> 01:19:41,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1022
01:19:41,975 --> 01:19:45,076
[SPEAKER_07]: This large sign is here, and this sign on the right.

1023
01:19:45,696 --> 01:19:47,777
[SPEAKER_11]: And give us, what is that about?

1024
01:19:47,817 --> 01:19:49,777
[SPEAKER_11]: What is that facing now that's facing?

1025
01:19:51,358 --> 01:19:53,718
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the site plan of the proposed hotel.

1026
01:19:54,419 --> 01:19:57,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's President's Landing, the Fellsway.

1027
01:19:57,299 --> 01:19:58,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So sign D is here.

1028
01:20:01,757 --> 01:20:03,117
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of across from the Margaritas.

1029
01:20:03,137 --> 01:20:03,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Facing Margaritas.

1030
01:20:04,018 --> 01:20:07,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and visible to southbound traffic on 28th.

1031
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:17,201
[SPEAKER_08]: The larger sign at the entrance is located here more on station landing and it's kind of interior to the development facing the rest of the station landing development.

1032
01:20:18,401 --> 01:20:18,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Question?

1033
01:20:18,701 --> 01:20:19,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1034
01:20:19,762 --> 01:20:20,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Penta?

1035
01:20:21,042 --> 01:20:23,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Any one of those signs, are either one of them interior lit?

1036
01:20:23,543 --> 01:20:27,944
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, this sign is internally illuminated.

1037
01:20:28,084 --> 01:20:29,484
The other sign on the right here is non-illuminated.

1038
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:33,110
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the only one that's going to be interior lit, that high one?

1039
01:20:34,991 --> 01:20:36,971
[SPEAKER_08]: As well as the canopy signage.

1040
01:20:39,992 --> 01:20:47,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Then the question becomes on the big AC sign, does that have an 11 o'clock curfew?

1041
01:20:48,353 --> 01:20:54,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Like across the street, let's say Kelly's Roast Beef.

1042
01:20:54,514 --> 01:21:00,555
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe they have an 11 o'clock time and they change it to one on their time that the interior lit sign stays on.

1043
01:21:05,648 --> 01:21:10,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you just need to better check, because if we give you that, you're looking for that 24 hours a day to be lit?

1044
01:21:11,111 --> 01:21:11,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1045
01:21:11,651 --> 01:21:12,812
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a 24 hour a day bill.

1046
01:21:12,832 --> 01:21:17,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you're going to be right next to another company that I believe has a cutoff in its time.

1047
01:21:17,774 --> 01:21:21,316
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think before, I think you need to.

1048
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:23,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1049
01:21:23,937 --> 01:21:27,359
[SPEAKER_18]: As a city, we're striving to bring in quality business and economic development.

1050
01:21:27,739 --> 01:21:33,161
[SPEAKER_18]: To tell a worldwide chain hotel that we can't have their sign lit up all the time,

1051
01:21:35,134 --> 01:21:36,375
[SPEAKER_18]: There's no way I can support that.

1052
01:21:36,575 --> 01:21:40,338
[SPEAKER_18]: If I supported that, it would be one of the worst votes I've ever taken as a member of the Medford City Council.

1053
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:44,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, again, could you put that sign up again?

1054
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:45,142
[SPEAKER_17]: What are you facing?

1055
01:21:45,902 --> 01:21:47,303
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that big sign for?

1056
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:48,204
[SPEAKER_08]: What's number A facing?

1057
01:21:48,684 --> 01:21:48,905
[SPEAKER_08]: This?

1058
01:21:49,225 --> 01:21:49,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1059
01:21:50,266 --> 01:21:50,966
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, what was it?

1060
01:21:50,986 --> 01:21:52,147
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you facing with that sign?

1061
01:21:52,167 --> 01:21:57,851
[SPEAKER_08]: This is facing to the north, uh, 75 station landing, the apartment building, uh, the Boston sports club.

1062
01:21:58,152 --> 01:21:59,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it faces also the parking garage.

1063
01:22:01,493 --> 01:22:04,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Mr. President, we need to be consistent if we're going to be consistent with this.

1064
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,063
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've got no problem with it.

1065
01:22:06,604 --> 01:22:12,477
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that, you know, there's a like business, you know, right next to you that I believe in one point in time.

1066
01:22:13,054 --> 01:22:17,475
[SPEAKER_17]: May I just point out at this— It's open, but I think the sign has to go off by 1 o'clock.

1067
01:22:17,915 --> 01:22:21,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor— Point of information, Mr. President.

1068
01:22:21,856 --> 01:22:23,217
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, point of information.

1069
01:22:23,437 --> 01:22:24,237
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is important.

1070
01:22:24,477 --> 01:22:26,718
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Camuso, point of information.

1071
01:22:26,798 --> 01:22:29,178
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Penta stated it's a like business.

1072
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:30,799
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a like business.

1073
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,879
[SPEAKER_18]: One's a 24-hour lodging establishment.

1074
01:22:32,899 --> 01:22:34,240
[SPEAKER_18]: The other one is a roast beef joint.

1075
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:36,320
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not a like business.

1076
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:42,622
[SPEAKER_15]: The reason for the lighting restriction, if I remember correctly, for the roast beef joint, Kelly's, if you would,

1077
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:47,704
[SPEAKER_15]: was the fact that directly across from it was housing, and there was concern for those condominiums.

1078
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:51,086
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello had a point of information.

1079
01:22:51,106 --> 01:22:51,266
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.

1080
01:22:51,286 --> 01:22:53,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say the same thing, Mr. President.

1081
01:22:53,407 --> 01:22:54,108
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 24-hour business.

1082
01:22:54,528 --> 01:22:59,210
[SPEAKER_06]: So they operate every day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.

1083
01:23:01,011 --> 01:23:04,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would think that they would need the illumination 24 hours a day.

1084
01:23:05,234 --> 01:23:05,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

1085
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:06,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1086
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:08,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is a quality organization.

1087
01:23:09,736 --> 01:23:11,257
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we should appreciate it.

1088
01:23:12,732 --> 01:23:20,776
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a point of clarification as it relates to that you're facing a residential neighborhood, correct?

1089
01:23:21,676 --> 01:23:23,717
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a residential building to the north of the hotel.

1090
01:23:23,737 --> 01:23:24,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1091
01:23:24,418 --> 01:23:28,239
[SPEAKER_17]: The business that we're talking about is likewise facing a residential neighborhood.

1092
01:23:28,259 --> 01:23:33,662
[SPEAKER_17]: So all I'm saying is if you've already established a policy or a time, I've got no problem giving it to them 24 hours.

1093
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:38,374
[SPEAKER_17]: But you're going to have to give the other people 24 hours.

1094
01:23:39,134 --> 01:23:56,703
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the bylaw allows for the sign to be lit during the hours of operation, which would be different for a restaurant or a food service establishment, which is limited hours, whereas the hotel is open, as the Councilor has pointed out, 24 hours a day, with guests checking in at any time.

1095
01:23:56,743 --> 01:24:03,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Point of clarification for the petitioner, we can limit the hours that it's lit, and I see Councilors

1096
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:06,572
[SPEAKER_11]: point, just because you're going to be facing apartments.

1097
01:24:06,612 --> 01:24:10,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So have you, have you, you know, any research on that?

1098
01:24:10,473 --> 01:24:12,814
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go in somebody's bedroom.

1099
01:24:12,954 --> 01:24:15,055
[SPEAKER_08]: We have not done any research in the apartment building.

1100
01:24:15,215 --> 01:24:22,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, this has been presented a couple of times to residents, uh, open forums of that apartment building, 75 station landing.

1101
01:24:22,637 --> 01:24:24,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and we, it was very well received.

1102
01:24:24,498 --> 01:24:26,459
[SPEAKER_08]: We did not receive any concern.

1103
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:29,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we, these same renderings were shown at that meeting.

1104
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:32,921
[SPEAKER_08]: There was no concern about the lighting, um, at those meetings.

1105
01:24:34,218 --> 01:24:36,420
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll just put a six-month review on the lighting.

1106
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:40,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight has been patiently waiting.

1107
01:24:40,363 --> 01:24:44,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Mr. President, Councilor Lungo took the words right out of my mouth.

1108
01:24:44,927 --> 01:24:49,791
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, these individuals are here petitioning us to approve a sign that's non-conforming.

1109
01:24:49,871 --> 01:24:54,535
[SPEAKER_14]: However, they'd like the sign to be governed under the actual ordinance that's in place for hours of operation.

1110
01:24:54,575 --> 01:24:57,718
[SPEAKER_14]: If they need to come back before us for a special permit, so be it at that time.

1111
01:24:58,679 --> 01:24:59,019
[SPEAKER_14]: However,

1112
01:24:59,786 --> 01:25:01,368
[SPEAKER_14]: in terms of holding up what they're trying to do.

1113
01:25:01,909 --> 01:25:03,251
[SPEAKER_14]: They're here under the governing ordinance.

1114
01:25:03,271 --> 01:25:05,333
[SPEAKER_14]: They're asking us to approve a non-conforming sign.

1115
01:25:05,674 --> 01:25:08,957
[SPEAKER_14]: The size of the sign is what they're asking for us to approve, not anything more or anything less.

1116
01:25:09,778 --> 01:25:11,520
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I don't think it's...

1117
01:25:12,288 --> 01:25:20,734
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a bad idea now that we have a motion for a six-month review from the date of opening, I would like to say, that we can approve the sign.

1118
01:25:20,794 --> 01:25:27,860
[SPEAKER_14]: If we have problems with the illumination later on, we can review it in six months, and we can bring that issue to the neighbours, and I'm sure that the developer and the neighbours can work it out.

1119
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:32,203
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they're coming to our community to invest millions and millions of dollars in here to make their neighbours upset.

1120
01:25:32,243 --> 01:25:36,126
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, with that being said, I'd move for approval as amended by Councilor Longo.

1121
01:25:36,746 --> 01:25:37,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1122
01:25:37,407 --> 01:25:38,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Camuso?

1123
01:25:38,287 --> 01:25:39,088
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may.

1124
01:25:39,548 --> 01:25:40,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1125
01:25:40,529 --> 01:25:41,269
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just a little bit...

1126
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:50,444
[SPEAKER_18]: disturbed that the comments were made this evening regarding a hotel with the name Marriott on it that's looking to come in our community.

1127
01:25:50,764 --> 01:25:53,366
[SPEAKER_18]: We're trying to entice business into this community.

1128
01:25:54,066 --> 01:26:03,452
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a hotel right out here that faces 400 units of senior housing developments right behind City Hall here that's illuminated 24 hours.

1129
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:09,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Quite honestly, when the sign ordinance was written by members of the City Council over the last 30 years,

1130
01:26:11,504 --> 01:26:14,206
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, I think, getting to the point where it's outdated.

1131
01:26:15,747 --> 01:26:24,191
[SPEAKER_18]: When a place like Meadow Glen Mall had to come before us a few years ago to have a sign that was basically comparable just to keep them in business.

1132
01:26:24,251 --> 01:26:26,873
[SPEAKER_18]: We got to have a vision moving this city forward, Mr. President.

1133
01:26:27,553 --> 01:26:33,417
[SPEAKER_18]: And to say that a 24-hour hotel that we want to see come here, I mean, the hotel is going to generate

1134
01:26:34,672 --> 01:26:37,413
[SPEAKER_18]: taxes every single evening, every time a room is occupied.

1135
01:26:37,894 --> 01:26:47,439
[SPEAKER_18]: The hotel is going to generate economic development as far as people spending their money at Kelly's Roast Beef, at all the stations landing.

1136
01:26:47,799 --> 01:26:51,060
[SPEAKER_18]: They're going to be using stuff over and Somerville is going to benefit by it.

1137
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:53,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Medford Square possibly will benefit.

1138
01:26:53,902 --> 01:26:55,003
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the vision we need.

1139
01:26:55,283 --> 01:27:03,087
[SPEAKER_18]: We need vision to do Medford Square over and to sit here and to talk about not giving a 24-hour establishment, marry it.

1140
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:15,057
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we're lucky that this didn't come up at the beginning of negotiations because a big company like Marriott may not even entertain coming here if they saw that we would even not entertain a sign.

1141
01:27:15,158 --> 01:27:18,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And the sign is not overly bearing on the neighbourhood at all.

1142
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:25,287
[SPEAKER_18]: Quite honestly, there's more lighting coming off over here of the Hyatt right out back of our building.

1143
01:27:26,846 --> 01:27:31,568
[SPEAKER_18]: In the interest of economic development and trying to move this city forward, I support this wholeheartedly.

1144
01:27:31,889 --> 01:27:37,391
[SPEAKER_18]: And to be honest with you, I'm not going to support the six-month review, because I think it's done very tastefully.

1145
01:27:38,032 --> 01:27:41,013
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's a win-win for this community.

1146
01:27:41,693 --> 01:27:46,576
[SPEAKER_15]: So... Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1147
01:27:46,896 --> 01:27:48,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1148
01:27:48,937 --> 01:27:51,898
[SPEAKER_11]: I, too, am very happy that the Marriott's coming to Medford.

1149
01:27:51,919 --> 01:27:54,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's going to be a great addition to the community.

1150
01:27:55,762 --> 01:28:12,748
[SPEAKER_11]: I also have been on the council for 14 years, and I know that if there's people that aren't able to sleep due to the level of illumination or the time of illumination, we've heard from a number of residents who have had to come forward and voice their concerns and displeasure of it.

1151
01:28:13,168 --> 01:28:21,951
[SPEAKER_11]: So I believe this is a great way to reintroduce the topic if need be in six months, whether that's just the level of illumination or

1152
01:28:22,595 --> 01:28:24,276
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the hours of illumination.

1153
01:28:24,296 --> 01:28:26,637
[SPEAKER_11]: It very well may be that nobody complains.

1154
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:28,038
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all well and good.

1155
01:28:28,058 --> 01:28:29,658
[SPEAKER_11]: It never comes before the council again.

1156
01:28:29,798 --> 01:28:32,500
[SPEAKER_11]: And I assume that that is the way it's going to be.

1157
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:40,343
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there's a problem, this is the only way the council can possibly even alleviate it within six months.

1158
01:28:40,804 --> 01:28:41,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1159
01:28:41,304 --> 01:28:49,928
[SPEAKER_15]: The chair now recognizes the chairman of the subcommittee for business, economics, development, and science, Councilor Michael J. Marks.

1160
01:28:52,668 --> 01:28:53,829
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a tough act to follow.

1161
01:28:56,351 --> 01:29:01,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, all the papers appear to be in order, and I agree with Councilor Longo, her statement.

1162
01:29:02,535 --> 01:29:15,884
[SPEAKER_05]: We are the appeal process, and every member behind this council has the right to ask questions, whether they believe the signage is too large, whether they believe the illumination is too much, and those are the appropriate questions we should ask, and then we take a vote as a body.

1163
01:29:15,925 --> 01:29:17,125
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not

1164
01:29:19,378 --> 01:29:22,160
[SPEAKER_05]: concerned about any particular questions, because that's what we're here to do.

1165
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,301
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to ask questions.

1166
01:29:23,961 --> 01:29:25,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And I see no problem with this.

1167
01:29:26,182 --> 01:29:27,563
[SPEAKER_05]: We welcome them into the community.

1168
01:29:27,963 --> 01:29:30,725
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they do well and bring us plenty of tax revenue.

1169
01:29:31,926 --> 01:29:37,509
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mr. President, I, as chairman of the sign committee, would motion for approval.

1170
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:39,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good on that motion.

1171
01:29:40,671 --> 01:29:42,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to sever, Mr. President.

1172
01:29:42,632 --> 01:29:43,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to sever.

1173
01:29:44,057 --> 01:29:48,443
[SPEAKER_14]: The amendments, Councilor Camuso is not willing to support a certain portion of it, so it's going to be contrary.

1174
01:29:48,523 --> 01:29:49,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we should sever the amendments.

1175
01:29:49,664 --> 01:29:52,889
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure he's in support of the hotel coming and getting the signage.

1176
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:54,851
[SPEAKER_14]: He's just not in support of the six-month review.

1177
01:29:54,911 --> 01:29:55,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1178
01:29:55,352 --> 01:29:55,973
[SPEAKER_14]: So motion to sever.

1179
01:29:55,993 --> 01:29:58,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to sever on the six-month review, Councilor Camuso.

1180
01:30:02,024 --> 01:30:03,305
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I apologize.

1181
01:30:03,405 --> 01:30:09,691
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to wrap up by saying, you know, we're at a very unique juncture here in our community of either moving forward or moving backwards.

1182
01:30:10,411 --> 01:30:14,074
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a big development coming right across the city line.

1183
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,396
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be known as the Winn-Everett.

1184
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:25,584
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to let businesses like the Marriott know that Medford wants them to come here and negotiate with us in good faith.

1185
01:30:26,078 --> 01:30:34,660
[SPEAKER_18]: and potentially build something on Mystic Ave or wherever they find a parcel of land that may be good for the community.

1186
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it has to be good for the community.

1187
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:41,361
[SPEAKER_18]: But I just don't want to send the wrong message out there and have businesses.

1188
01:30:41,381 --> 01:30:51,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I've heard over the years, over the last 30 years in this community, people have been... People... I want to choose my words correctly and be fair.

1189
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:59,513
[SPEAKER_18]: We have heard that people feel uncomfortable sometimes when they come before some bodies here, particularly the Medford City Council.

1190
01:31:00,293 --> 01:31:18,821
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just think that in fairness for economic development views and where we're going with our neighboring community, I think we're at a juncture where we just have to show that we want to move the city forward, whether it be liquor licenses, whether it be hotel establishments, whether it be restaurants.

1191
01:31:21,118 --> 01:31:23,879
[SPEAKER_18]: I just think we're at a great juncture to move the city forward.

1192
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,701
[SPEAKER_18]: And quite honestly, I just want to send the right message.

1193
01:31:27,061 --> 01:31:28,922
[SPEAKER_18]: And that Councilor Knight took the words out of my mouth.

1194
01:31:29,102 --> 01:31:33,864
[SPEAKER_18]: I do support the sign, naturally, but not the review at this point.

1195
01:31:33,904 --> 01:31:34,765
[SPEAKER_18]: It's done tastefully.

1196
01:31:35,085 --> 01:31:37,386
[SPEAKER_18]: So if we could just sever it and then move on with the issue.

1197
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:38,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

1198
01:31:38,767 --> 01:31:39,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

1199
01:31:39,847 --> 01:31:40,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1200
01:31:40,948 --> 01:31:42,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, Councilor Coombs was correct.

1201
01:31:43,469 --> 01:31:45,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Our sign order is over 20 years old now.

1202
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:48,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, something that needs to be revisited.

1203
01:31:50,543 --> 01:31:53,205
[SPEAKER_06]: These people, we're very happy to have them come into our committee.

1204
01:31:53,565 --> 01:32:00,390
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't have had to come up here tonight for a rejection when it should have been approved downstairs at the building department.

1205
01:32:00,870 --> 01:32:05,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, our audience are old and some of them are antiquated.

1206
01:32:06,133 --> 01:32:09,796
[SPEAKER_06]: We've changed our liquor laws several times to accommodate the new businesses.

1207
01:32:11,617 --> 01:32:13,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I talked about the other night.

1208
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:17,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Our city is getting beat to death with competition from other communities.

1209
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:26,846
[SPEAKER_06]: And we should be welcoming these businesses and they would open arms instead of having to come up here again and ask for a denial of a sign that should have been approved from day one.

1210
01:32:30,548 --> 01:32:31,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor.

1211
01:32:31,829 --> 01:32:32,589
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Penter.

1212
01:32:33,810 --> 01:32:35,231
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate the fact that you're here.

1213
01:32:35,251 --> 01:32:38,013
[SPEAKER_17]: I support you, but I also understand

1214
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,380
[SPEAKER_17]: that your development did not come here because of the City of Medford.

1215
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:45,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Your development came here because of Ted Tai and the business that he has there at Stations Landing.

1216
01:32:45,742 --> 01:32:55,227
[SPEAKER_17]: You are the last part of the development of that whole development process over there, that six-story hotel, because when he came in here, it was gonna be in the beginning, but there wasn't a call for it economically.

1217
01:32:55,687 --> 01:33:01,170
[SPEAKER_17]: This City of Medford needs to get out there as a unit, as a community, to look for businesses to come in here.

1218
01:33:01,190 --> 01:33:02,670
[SPEAKER_17]: They haven't done it for a long period of time.

1219
01:33:03,190 --> 01:33:06,372
[SPEAKER_17]: This Medford City Council is equally to blame, equally to blame,

1220
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:09,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Because all we do sometimes is talk about it, and nothing's been done.

1221
01:33:09,571 --> 01:33:11,151
[SPEAKER_17]: There's been no review of the sign ordinances.

1222
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:13,351
[SPEAKER_17]: There's been no review of the taxicab ordinances.

1223
01:33:13,411 --> 01:33:14,312
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can go through all of that.

1224
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:18,353
[SPEAKER_17]: So to get through all of that, you don't want to hear that, because that's not your problem.

1225
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:19,853
[SPEAKER_17]: That's our problem over here.

1226
01:33:20,213 --> 01:33:21,333
[SPEAKER_17]: So all I'm telling you is this.

1227
01:33:21,373 --> 01:33:24,894
[SPEAKER_17]: You understand that there are rules and regulations, and that's the reason why you got here.

1228
01:33:24,914 --> 01:33:34,216
[SPEAKER_17]: And the reason why you're here, rather than going to the Board of Appeals, because it would cost you a hell of a lot of money to go to the Board of Appeals to appeal that, for which you're coming here before the council.

1229
01:33:34,741 --> 01:33:39,202
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the reason why the council put this in its sign ordinance many, many years ago.

1230
01:33:39,222 --> 01:33:39,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1231
01:33:40,482 --> 01:33:44,403
[SPEAKER_17]: And as a result of that, and I think you understand where we're going with all of this.

1232
01:33:44,563 --> 01:33:46,444
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's nothing wrong with a six month review.

1233
01:33:46,484 --> 01:33:51,605
[SPEAKER_17]: As a matter of fact, it might make you a better and a stronger, have a relationship as to what's going on.

1234
01:33:51,645 --> 01:33:54,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause when you can come back here, you can tell us all about the wonderful things you're doing.

1235
01:33:55,306 --> 01:34:00,587
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, this city only operates with one and a half people, one and a half people out of an office of community development.

1236
01:34:00,947 --> 01:34:03,228
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guarantee you never saw them once in your whole proposal.

1237
01:34:03,848 --> 01:34:04,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1238
01:34:04,617 --> 01:34:10,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the reason we didn't say it, because they just don't have the manpower or the time or the wherewithal to come out there and do it.

1239
01:34:11,101 --> 01:34:12,501
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all going to change in January.

1240
01:34:12,541 --> 01:34:15,983
[SPEAKER_17]: There's going to be a new administration, and you're going to see a new life come into this community.

1241
01:34:16,003 --> 01:34:17,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we do a lot of sign work in Medford.

1242
01:34:17,524 --> 01:34:17,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1243
01:34:18,164 --> 01:34:18,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1244
01:34:18,485 --> 01:34:19,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all very much.

1245
01:34:19,645 --> 01:34:25,448
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion for approval, and we ask, so we take the motion to sever first.

1246
01:34:26,389 --> 01:34:28,070
[SPEAKER_15]: We have the motion to sever before us.

1247
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:33,593
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion to sever the two amendments, sever the amendment

1248
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:36,442
[SPEAKER_15]: for a six-month review from the main motion.

01:40:42,519 --> 01:40:43,459
[SPEAKER_20]: Pending construction.

1378
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:43,980
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1379
01:40:44,660 --> 01:40:46,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Hopefully soon in the next month or so.

1380
01:40:47,303 --> 01:40:47,683
[SPEAKER_11]: November.

1381
01:40:47,703 --> 01:40:48,624
[SPEAKER_20]: Hopefully.

1382
01:40:48,764 --> 01:40:49,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, great.

1383
01:40:49,284 --> 01:40:49,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck.

1384
01:40:49,965 --> 01:40:50,365
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1385
01:40:50,385 --> 01:40:51,987
[SPEAKER_15]: So, on the motion approved by Councilor

1386
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:54,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Caraviello seconded by Vice President Laura Kern.

1387
01:40:54,921 --> 01:40:55,582
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1388
01:40:56,102 --> 01:40:56,683
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1389
01:40:57,124 --> 01:40:57,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1390
01:40:57,845 --> 01:40:58,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

1391
01:40:58,866 --> 01:40:59,186
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1392
01:40:59,687 --> 01:41:00,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1393
01:41:00,688 --> 01:41:02,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Communications from the Mayor, 15-628 was withdrawn.

1394
01:41:08,392 --> 01:41:10,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Citizen, would you like to speak?

1395
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:11,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, everyone.

1396
01:41:11,573 --> 01:41:13,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record, Sharon.

1397
01:41:14,074 --> 01:41:16,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Sharon Tiasso, 130 Circuit Road in Medford, Mass.

1398
01:41:17,715 --> 01:41:18,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, everyone.

1399
01:41:18,695 --> 01:41:19,696
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good to see you back.

1400
01:41:21,376 --> 01:41:26,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to speak on an issue, and then someone brought up bus routing again tonight.

1401
01:41:26,198 --> 01:41:29,719
[SPEAKER_10]: But I really think that both are equally important, and they're related.

1402
01:41:30,539 --> 01:41:35,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost a year ago, I came here, and you know the scenario about people falling, et cetera, on the sidewalks.

1403
01:41:36,021 --> 01:41:40,123
[SPEAKER_10]: At that time, Councilwoman Luongo had suggested an audit.

1404
01:41:40,824 --> 01:41:56,573
[SPEAKER_10]: About three months ago, I came forth again because I had heard about more incidents of falling on damaged or broken, weather-beaten, or sidewalks that just had rises in them.

1405
01:41:56,913 --> 01:41:58,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're all over the city now.

1406
01:41:58,193 --> 01:42:00,555
[SPEAKER_10]: There may be a few streets that haven't been harmed too much.

1407
01:42:01,215 --> 01:42:04,577
[SPEAKER_10]: But I was just wondering, and that night too, they also suggested

1408
01:42:04,937 --> 01:42:06,778
[SPEAKER_10]: that there be an inspection of the sidewalks.

1409
01:42:07,559 --> 01:42:08,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Has anything been done yet?

1410
01:42:10,401 --> 01:42:14,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that this is a really important issue, especially in the fall time.

1411
01:42:15,384 --> 01:42:24,250
[SPEAKER_10]: Kids are on scooters, they're on bikes, and I know it's going to be not an inexpensive proposition, but I can't believe that in 10 months

1412
01:42:25,047 --> 01:42:28,234
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know the system and the process, so maybe you could educate me.

1413
01:42:28,815 --> 01:42:31,381
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens if something is approved by the council?

1414
01:42:31,882 --> 01:42:34,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it just go somewhere and then it just disappears?

1415
01:42:36,189 --> 01:42:36,589
[SPEAKER_10]: happens.

1416
01:42:36,889 --> 01:42:38,970
[SPEAKER_15]: What is that specifically you're asking about?

1417
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:47,534
[SPEAKER_10]: The audit that was to go into effect by the council about ten minutes ten months ago and also again about three months ago.

1418
01:42:47,554 --> 01:42:49,294
[SPEAKER_10]: The audit of what?

1419
01:42:49,534 --> 01:42:50,715
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens after that.

1420
01:42:53,936 --> 01:42:57,318
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could remind us of the streets that I remember you there was

1421
01:42:59,628 --> 01:43:02,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, one is the sidewalks, right.

1422
01:43:03,351 --> 01:43:10,296
[SPEAKER_10]: But what happened now with the two requests that you put in, where does that request go to have an audit on the sidewalk or on the inspection?

1423
01:43:10,637 --> 01:43:13,359
[SPEAKER_15]: It goes to the mayor's office.

1424
01:43:14,039 --> 01:43:15,681
[SPEAKER_10]: So no news yet?

1425
01:43:15,821 --> 01:43:18,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing about the conditions or repairs or anything yet?

1426
01:43:20,765 --> 01:43:25,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we get a response from the mayor, and he referred it to DPW.

1427
01:43:26,049 --> 01:43:27,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So ours is a recommendation.

1428
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:31,701
[SPEAKER_05]: If it goes to the mayor, he refers it to DPW, and we haven't heard back since.

1429
01:43:31,921 --> 01:43:34,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to follow up, Mr. President.

1430
01:43:34,744 --> 01:43:35,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you very much.

1431
01:43:36,285 --> 01:43:39,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Secondly, regarding bus routes, that was an important issue.

1432
01:43:40,468 --> 01:43:43,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I also feel that they're getting worse than now, and now they're going to get worse.

1433
01:43:44,191 --> 01:43:54,360
[SPEAKER_10]: Because those rivets, if anyone did take the time to drive around to see them, they're from almost the donut shop all the way down to the CBS, across the street.

1434
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:56,842
[SPEAKER_10]: You saw them, remember we were talking about them?

1435
01:43:57,102 --> 01:43:59,683
[SPEAKER_10]: You step off the sidewalk, if it's an older people at night.

1436
01:44:00,383 --> 01:44:03,265
[SPEAKER_10]: I helped a woman, she almost fell on her face.

1437
01:44:03,705 --> 01:44:04,725
[SPEAKER_10]: They're like this.

1438
01:44:04,805 --> 01:44:08,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Now they're in front of even Mr. Veneziano's business.

1439
01:44:08,567 --> 01:44:10,908
[SPEAKER_10]: They're on the other side in front of Modern Pastry now.

1440
01:44:11,308 --> 01:44:14,849
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the weight and the heat, I believe, of the delivery trucks and the buses.

1441
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:19,951
[SPEAKER_10]: And so someone suggested that night that you need to call the T. Did anyone call the T yet?

1442
01:44:20,412 --> 01:44:23,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I think I put that on the council floor.

1443
01:44:24,482 --> 01:44:34,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Two months ago, they had the team come down and look at the rolling hills there in Lippert Square, and we never got a response.

1444
01:44:34,824 --> 01:44:38,565
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the nice thing about it is not that you want people to get hurt.

1445
01:44:38,965 --> 01:44:43,206
[SPEAKER_10]: The nice thing about addressing it is you can avoid some accidents that will save the city money.

1446
01:44:43,546 --> 01:44:46,966
[SPEAKER_10]: And not only that, it's coming winter again, and they're probably going to get worse.

1447
01:44:47,006 --> 01:44:49,247
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank you very much, Mr. Caraviello.

1448
01:44:49,627 --> 01:44:51,187
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't coming here to criticize.

1449
01:44:51,577 --> 01:44:54,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to get the status because I know you fellows are busy.

1450
01:44:55,404 --> 01:44:56,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with you.

1451
01:44:56,406 --> 01:44:58,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them are five and six inches deep.

1452
01:44:58,688 --> 01:45:09,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, and now they're all along Salem Street, right going towards in front of the eyeglass shop, you know, Ricky Bazonga and the businessman down there.

1453
01:45:10,158 --> 01:45:16,283
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost, I got out of the car just to say hello to him one day, and I went in one, and I said, Rick, this is terrible.

1454
01:45:16,323 --> 01:45:17,204
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, tell me about it.

1455
01:45:17,224 --> 01:45:19,486
[SPEAKER_10]: I have two people, and they don't see well when they come in here.

1456
01:45:20,026 --> 01:45:21,488
[SPEAKER_10]: So I said, well, maybe I'll address it.

1457
01:45:21,528 --> 01:45:22,629
[SPEAKER_10]: He said, thank you very much.

1458
01:45:22,809 --> 01:45:25,992
[SPEAKER_18]: We can ask a motion to get the update as Councilor Marks

1459
01:45:26,977 --> 01:45:27,337
[SPEAKER_18]: As for.

1460
01:45:27,737 --> 01:45:30,498
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the motion of Council Mark seconded by Councilor Musil.

1461
01:45:31,298 --> 01:45:32,779
[SPEAKER_10]: And the tea has more money than we do.

1462
01:45:32,919 --> 01:45:33,699
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

1463
01:45:34,379 --> 01:45:36,220
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Councilor Caraviello.

1464
01:45:36,460 --> 01:45:37,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1465
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,841
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a nice week.

1466
01:45:39,081 --> 01:45:40,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you want to speak on this matter, ma'am?

1467
01:45:41,021 --> 01:45:42,182
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1468
01:45:42,582 --> 01:45:47,704
[SPEAKER_21]: The lighting is very, very bad over there at night when you're coming down, you can't see.

1469
01:45:48,164 --> 01:45:52,585
[SPEAKER_21]: And someone's definitely going to get killed coming over all those bumps and everything.

1470
01:45:52,965 --> 01:45:55,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Like if someone's crossing, you won't be able to see them.

1471
01:45:56,333 --> 01:45:57,354
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very, very dark.

1472
01:45:57,394 --> 01:45:59,136
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know who drives under there at night.

1473
01:45:59,816 --> 01:46:01,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereabouts are you talking?

1474
01:46:02,018 --> 01:46:02,719
[SPEAKER_21]: At the bridge, right?

1475
01:46:02,739 --> 01:46:05,001
[SPEAKER_21]: When you're coming off of Main Street to come into Medford Square?

1476
01:46:05,141 --> 01:46:05,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1477
01:46:05,301 --> 01:46:06,682
[SPEAKER_21]: Both areas going both ways.

1478
01:46:07,123 --> 01:46:07,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

1479
01:46:08,043 --> 01:46:13,088
[SPEAKER_21]: But more so on the coming into Medford Square, that side's more dark, coming under the bridges.

1480
01:46:14,449 --> 01:46:15,110
[SPEAKER_21]: It's dangerous.

1481
01:46:15,310 --> 01:46:15,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

1482
01:46:16,151 --> 01:46:17,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Especially with the construction that's going on.

1483
01:46:17,892 --> 01:46:18,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Send that to DPW, too.

1484
01:46:19,553 --> 01:46:21,514
[SPEAKER_15]: You said that to the electrical department also?

1485
01:46:21,594 --> 01:46:24,136
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Councilor Marksley, sent to the electrical department.

1486
01:46:24,616 --> 01:46:25,757
[SPEAKER_15]: So on that motion, Councilor?

1487
01:46:25,777 --> 01:46:34,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I do recall us taking a vote for $1.4 million for what was termed the Community Improvement Initiative.

1488
01:46:34,642 --> 01:46:44,008
[SPEAKER_14]: And included in that Community Improvement Initiative was $300,000, I believe, for sidewalk and stump repair, as well as energy efficient lighting.

1489
01:46:45,082 --> 01:46:48,623
[SPEAKER_14]: change-outs down in Medford Square for brighter and more energy efficient lighting.

1490
01:46:49,163 --> 01:46:51,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if we can get an update on those two items.

1491
01:46:52,404 --> 01:46:58,606
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended by Councilor Knight to include an update on the Community Improvement Initiative Program.

1492
01:46:58,686 --> 01:46:59,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso.

1493
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:04,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Just FYI, the sidewalks, massive sidewalk

1494
01:47:06,405 --> 01:47:10,008
[SPEAKER_18]: The plan that's been in the works is going to be taken off within the next two weeks or so.

1495
01:47:11,069 --> 01:47:12,751
[SPEAKER_18]: They're waiting for that second bid to come in and everything.

1496
01:47:13,191 --> 01:47:16,754
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you notice, a lot of them are actually getting dug out right now by the DPW.

1497
01:47:17,134 --> 01:47:17,555
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1498
01:47:17,735 --> 01:47:23,980
[SPEAKER_18]: So you'll see them actively doing a lot of sidewalks over the next, until it gets cold out.

1499
01:47:24,761 --> 01:47:25,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1500
01:47:26,783 --> 01:47:28,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Ma'am, do you want to address the council?

1501
01:47:30,186 --> 01:47:30,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1502
01:47:30,666 --> 01:47:31,487
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion,

1503
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:34,220
[SPEAKER_15]: As amended, as seconded.

1504
01:47:34,520 --> 01:47:35,441
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1505
01:47:35,841 --> 01:47:36,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1506
01:47:36,301 --> 01:47:41,742
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1507
01:47:41,782 --> 01:47:42,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Passes.

1508
01:47:42,462 --> 01:47:44,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Joanne Haney, 123 Placestead Road.

1509
01:47:44,262 --> 01:47:45,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a question.

1510
01:47:46,063 --> 01:47:49,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Verizon and Comcast are here in MedFed.

1511
01:47:50,143 --> 01:47:51,764
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a satellite dish.

1512
01:47:52,524 --> 01:47:58,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I like to watch what's going on in the city council, and we can't get it through satellite.

1513
01:47:59,098 --> 01:48:02,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any way that it can come into play?

1514
01:48:02,662 --> 01:48:05,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask a question?

1515
01:48:05,385 --> 01:48:05,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1516
01:48:05,786 --> 01:48:11,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there such a thing as a franchise agreement with the satellite provider?

1517
01:48:11,432 --> 01:48:13,775
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think there is, no.

1518
01:48:15,376 --> 01:48:20,302
[SPEAKER_15]: You'd have to contact your satellite company, satellite provider, to ask if they have

1519
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:33,677
[SPEAKER_15]: the capacity to connect with the local cable companies to provide you broadcast of the city meetings, I would imagine.

1520
01:48:33,697 --> 01:48:35,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1521
01:48:35,838 --> 01:48:41,762
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the channels with satellite, but this is one that I can't get at all.

1522
01:48:42,342 --> 01:48:43,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, if I could.

1523
01:48:43,683 --> 01:48:47,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I have every cable channel you can imagine, and there's never anything on TV.

1524
01:48:49,970 --> 01:48:53,453
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an exclusive contract we have with the cable provider.

1525
01:48:54,133 --> 01:48:58,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And whether they allow the satellite to tap into that, I'm not sure.

1526
01:48:59,238 --> 01:49:00,519
[SPEAKER_05]: But I guess we can ask the question.

1527
01:49:00,899 --> 01:49:03,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1528
01:49:04,042 --> 01:49:04,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1529
01:49:04,962 --> 01:49:05,363
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Ms.

1530
01:49:05,383 --> 01:49:05,663
[SPEAKER_15]: Haney.

1531
01:49:06,103 --> 01:49:17,513
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're on to suspension, offered by Councilor Caraviello, be resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the Brooks PTO on winning the $20,000 contest

1532
01:49:19,252 --> 01:49:21,553
[SPEAKER_15]: At assembly row, councilor Caraviello.

1533
01:49:21,933 --> 01:49:23,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1534
01:49:24,333 --> 01:49:31,575
[SPEAKER_06]: As you saw in the paper last week, the Brooks Street GO won $20,000 from assembly row.

1535
01:49:33,516 --> 01:49:37,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Amongst all the schools that went over there competed for the amount of points.

1536
01:49:39,097 --> 01:49:44,019
[SPEAKER_06]: And our school was the winning school, and I want to commend them for that.

1537
01:49:45,787 --> 01:49:47,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight we approved three businesses, new businesses.

1538
01:49:48,147 --> 01:49:58,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully next year, two years down, we'll be able to have a contest similar to what Assembly Road does to invite other people to come into our city and spend some money.

1539
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:01,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we can award a prize.

1540
01:50:02,350 --> 01:50:06,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I want to congratulate the parents and the kids of the Brooks PTO.

1541
01:50:08,431 --> 01:50:08,971
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1542
01:50:09,412 --> 01:50:10,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello on the motion.

1543
01:50:10,792 --> 01:50:11,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

1544
01:50:12,219 --> 01:50:13,900
[SPEAKER_15]: for congratulations, Councilor Penta.

1545
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:22,546
[SPEAKER_17]: On that particular motion, Rick, I think you forgot to say that they had to spend $200,000 in Somerville to get that $20,000 to come back to the school.

1546
01:50:23,006 --> 01:50:28,810
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's approximately $200,000 that could have been spent here in the city of Medford that didn't find its way here.

1547
01:50:28,830 --> 01:50:35,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully when we get some new businesses here, we'll be more competitive with the other cities and we'll have our own contest someday.

1548
01:50:36,274 --> 01:50:36,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

1549
01:50:36,635 --> 01:50:38,056
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1550
01:50:38,696 --> 01:50:39,436
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1551
01:50:39,456 --> 01:50:40,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1552
01:50:43,297 --> 01:50:57,480
[SPEAKER_15]: 15-655 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved that the Medford City Council offer congratulations to Joe Sacco and Mike Pagliarulo on their recent induction into the National Italian Hall of Fame.

1553
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:58,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you again, Mr. President.

1554
01:50:58,740 --> 01:51:05,721
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've, uh, I've, I've known both of these, uh, their parents and them since high school, uh, and watched them play.

1555
01:51:05,781 --> 01:51:09,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, they're, uh, Medford high school graduates, both of them.

1556
01:51:10,235 --> 01:51:14,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Couldn't be more proud of our Italian friends in the community.

1557
01:51:15,237 --> 01:51:17,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And congratulations to them and their families.

1558
01:51:17,938 --> 01:51:18,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Well-deserved.

1559
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:20,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Both classy gentlemen, too.

1560
01:51:20,519 --> 01:51:21,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, very good.

1561
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:22,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations on that motion.

1562
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:23,261
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1563
01:51:23,801 --> 01:51:24,541
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1564
01:51:24,561 --> 01:51:25,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1565
01:51:25,302 --> 01:51:27,583
[SPEAKER_15]: Congratulations.

1566
01:51:27,843 --> 01:51:38,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council thank the DPW, and namely the Highway Department, for their prompt response to Resolution 15-611,

1567
01:51:40,498 --> 01:51:44,121
[SPEAKER_15]: regarding Winthrop Street at High Street and striping concerns.

1568
01:51:44,201 --> 01:51:44,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1569
01:51:45,602 --> 01:51:46,963
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1570
01:51:47,023 --> 01:51:56,110
[SPEAKER_14]: The resolution in question called for the DPW to re-stripe the crosswalk at Winthrop Street as well as repaint the three handicap parking spots that were right in front of 190 High Street.

1571
01:51:57,091 --> 01:51:59,272
[SPEAKER_14]: The resolution was put on the table on August 11th.

1572
01:51:59,372 --> 01:52:01,594
[SPEAKER_14]: By August 22nd, all the work was done.

1573
01:52:03,035 --> 01:52:05,637
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to that work, they also did some striping on Rural Ave.

1574
01:52:06,161 --> 01:52:13,003
[SPEAKER_14]: It came out pretty nice, looks pretty good, Mr. President, but I might want to thank the highway department in particular for their fast turnaround on this request.

1575
01:52:13,843 --> 01:52:14,183
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

1576
01:52:14,203 --> 01:52:16,884
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1577
01:52:16,904 --> 01:52:17,584
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1578
01:52:17,604 --> 01:52:18,764
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1579
01:52:19,344 --> 01:52:24,666
[SPEAKER_15]: And finally, last paper in the hand of the clerk, offered by Councilors Camuso and Garaviello.

1580
01:52:25,246 --> 01:52:34,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have a moment of silence and send its condolences to the family of John Jack Toomey, former city councilor who passed away recently.

1581
01:52:36,078 --> 01:52:38,158
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you would all please stand for a moment of silence.

1582
01:52:50,921 --> 01:52:51,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1583
01:52:52,981 --> 01:53:05,183
[SPEAKER_05]: It was about a month and a half ago, a resolution that we have a public hearing regarding the Eversource project that's going to be coming from Winchester down Winthrop Street to South Street down Mystic Ave.

1584
01:53:05,993 --> 01:53:16,661
[SPEAKER_05]: onto, I believe, the Revere and Chelsea area, but it's gonna disrupt many of our roadways that have already been dug up and cause congestion in our community.

1585
01:53:17,421 --> 01:53:21,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any movement on that Eversource hearing?

1586
01:53:25,287 --> 01:53:34,433
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could, it's a major project that, at the very least, residents I'm hearing from would like to have input, in particular, the direct abutters on Winthrop Street.

1587
01:53:34,877 --> 01:53:35,277
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1588
01:53:35,297 --> 01:53:47,202
[SPEAKER_15]: And we need to do it at a, maybe a meeting in an informal matter because, uh, there was a meeting here before, but I mean, clearly there's a, a deep concern that, uh, citizens didn't feel was adequately addressed on this matter.

1589
01:53:47,262 --> 01:54:01,649
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, uh, the clerk is continuing to work with that resource to bring that about and their public, uh, relations manager, um, uh, uh, Billy, um, uh, uh, Zamperelli, uh, is very good to work with.

1590
01:54:01,729 --> 01:54:02,409
[SPEAKER_15]: I've spoken to him.

1591
01:54:03,094 --> 01:54:05,275
[SPEAKER_15]: regarding this matter on several occasions.

1592
01:54:05,635 --> 01:54:06,415
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll pull it together.

1593
01:54:06,535 --> 01:54:06,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1594
01:54:07,055 --> 01:54:08,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much, Councilor.

1595
01:54:08,995 --> 01:54:19,078
[SPEAKER_15]: So the records, the tabled records of the July 21st, 2015 meeting were passed to Councilor Penta.

1596
01:54:19,558 --> 01:54:23,239
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor, do you have a recommendation on those records?

1597
01:54:23,919 --> 01:54:24,079
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1598
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:25,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Next week.

1599
01:54:26,199 --> 01:54:28,720
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer to table those until next week.

1600
01:54:29,345 --> 01:54:30,786
[SPEAKER_15]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1601
01:54:31,166 --> 01:54:31,686
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1602
01:54:31,966 --> 01:54:35,928
[SPEAKER_15]: Records of the August 11th, 2015 were passed to Councilor Camuso.

1603
01:54:36,368 --> 01:54:38,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Camuso, how did you find those records?

1604
01:54:40,170 --> 01:54:43,512
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso for approval, all those in favor?

1605
01:54:43,532 --> 01:54:44,772
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1606
01:54:44,892 --> 01:54:46,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

1607
01:54:47,753 --> 01:54:49,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Marks.

1608
01:54:50,255 --> 01:54:50,935
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?
