    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=494.485s">You</a>  want to turn your... You can hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=509.517s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=510.618s">Zach,</a>  now I know exactly how you feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=513.421s">So</a>  powerful.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=515.121s">Just</a>  swing the gavel down to the right, not the left.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=518.942s">I</a>  won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=519.322s">Well,</a>  good evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=521.383s">Thank</a>  you for joining us this evening for our subcommittee on education and cultural committee today, February 25th, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=528.484s">Will</a>  our clerk call the roll, please?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=537.086s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=537.726s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=538.626s">Councilor</a>  Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=540.127s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=540.287s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=540.887s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=543.193s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, his informant is gonna be a little bit late. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=546.754s">Mr.</a>  Chair, Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=547.935s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=548.255s">Okay,</a>  four present, one showing up soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=556.277s">Let's</a>  move forward if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=558.098s">So</a>  this is, we're here to discuss Resolution 25-027, Resolution to Discuss Recreation Department Programs for Youth with Disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=568.782s">Be</a>  it resolved that the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=570.573s">on</a>  education and culture schedule a meeting on February 25 at six o'clock city council chambers, the committee will discuss the needs of the recreation department for the upcoming budget season, and the committee will also discuss the recreational programs involving our disabled community if I can, if you can all allow me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=588.513s">I</a>  would like if my fellow Councilors, because the parents are the reason why we're here, I think that it would behoove us to have them speak and just share with us because part of this discussion is starting a new slate here at Medford with recreation, our leadership team, and looking into making sure that we have a partnership <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=611.485s">with</a>  our parents, the recreation department, and the city leadership to make sure that we can follow through for our wishes for our families, disabled families here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=625.112s">So</a>  would anybody like to kick it off? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=628.294s">Come</a>  on up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=631.796s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=632.576s">Name</a>  and... Nice to see you, my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=639.66s">We</a>  sure do.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=648.625s">You're</a>  up.</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=649.365s">I'm</a>  on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=649.866s">Oh,</a>  I'm on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=650.606s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=651.807s">So</a>  I kind of wanted to kind of give a little synopsis of the vision of it through parents' eyes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=659.29s">And</a>  I know that you have heard a lot of this, but I've been a parent now from toddler to elementary to middle to high school to transition program and forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=672.599s">So</a>  as far as, you know, I know the conversation was that Medford didn't really offer a lot of activities for our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=680.402s">A</a>  lot of our kids have to go out of town to be able to participate in activities, as my child did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=686.464s">And</a>  even with you, George, we went to Summerville, and it was an amazing program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=690.106s">And</a>  I'll never forget that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=691.826s">That</a>  was awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=694.187s">But</a>  I want to just I want to take a minute to be honest, when our kids currently participate in inclusive activities in Medford, it's intermittent best it's when the supports are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=705.861s">And</a>  it's often taking part in a peripheral manner kind of like a parallel position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=712.216s">So</a>  the full inclusivity would be our kids participating as all the other kids do because the necessary supports would just automatically be there in Medford, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=721.083s">And</a>  that's our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=722.644s">That's</a>  what we want and that's what we're working towards together as a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=727.648s">We're</a>  realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=729.53s">We</a>  know how hard it is to get sufficient staff and train them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=734.626s">and</a>  it doesn't make it any less important and it doesn't provide a reason for us to need to be grateful that Medford tried when the support staff or training isn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=746.46s">As</a>  an example, if a business is putting out a product, right, for a customer and that product or the way it's produced or the timing doesn't work, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=756.054s">The</a>  customer work for the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=758.636s">The</a>  business doesn't say, well, we tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=760.958s">They</a>  make the necessary changes to modify the product or its production so that it works for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=766.582s">In</a>  simpler words, when a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=777.671s">With</a>  all that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=780.208s">Our</a>  thought about placing the citywide inclusion specialist under med rec because the position needs to be housed somewhere is a little bit low key pigeonholing those services to mostly recreation, which is obviously like a really small part of the city experience and the small part of the city that would get to realize the improvements as opposed to citywide by definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=805.804s">And</a>  while not trying to sound ungrateful, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=809.379s">We</a>  as parents don't always wanna have to be grateful that there are programs for our kids in Medford, it should be a given. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=818.106s">My</a>  kid turns 21 in three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=822.009s">So</a>  I am now kind of past the med rec perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=827.093s">So</a>  a lot of the activities may not be of interest to him at this point and that's okay because a citywide inclusion specialist would make other aspects of the city more inclusive for people his age and older and for what they might like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=840.291s">The</a>  initial request was for an inclusion specialist for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=845.745s">to</a>  look at recreation, transportation, the library, the post office, restaurants, grocery stores, police and fire stations, hospitals, banks, art centers, places of worship, parks, pathways, ponds, voting centers, city council and school committee meetings, celebrations in Medford, Medford events, venues with live entertainment, local craft fairs, holiday celebrations, farmers markets, employment opportunities, just to name a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=873.873s">And</a>  basically every aspect of what makes a city a city, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=877.716s">We</a>  would ask that there be more options provided for where the inclusion specialist can be housed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=882.86s">As</a>  we know, MedRec is not the only department available. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=886.242s">And</a>  because our kids with disabilities grew up to be adults with disabilities, wouldn't it be great if they could navigate the city more easily because the inclusion specialist helped in all areas for all stages of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=897.57s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=898.771s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=900.678s">Patricia</a>  Cherry, I know we have had multiple conversations and I am so appreciative like you are just so enthusiastic and wanting to get out there and wanting to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=917.393s">And</a>  this is this is my first time working with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=920.175s">And</a>  I'm super excited about everything that you had spoken about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=924.898s">It's</a>  just that we're a little bit nervous because where you're trying to bring it back to is someplace that we didn't have great success at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=935.425s">And</a>  we did reach out, we did try. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=937.706s">I</a>  know there was staffing issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=939.428s">We</a>  would try to reach out and try to set something up and let's get something going and we can help here and we wanna do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=944.991s">And</a>  there was just no want or desire there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=948.325s">And</a>  we're just afraid that we fought this hard to get this position even spoken about, that we want to get it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=957.027s">We</a>  don't want it to be just another 3 to 4 PM on a Saturday program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=966.468s">It</a>  needs to be bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=967.769s">It</a>  needs to be citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=972.029s">So</a>  that's where we're at.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=974.43s">All</a>  right, thank you.</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=976.037s">Yeah,</a>  I want to stress that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=977.317s">Name</a>  and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=978.378s">Alexandra</a>  Lorig, station manager, 75. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=981.559s">I</a>  just did. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=984.26s">I</a>  just want to say that we are really looking and we really need a citywide position because our experience is that when we talk with people and ask, they really want to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=994.523s">And</a>  one example is the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=996.544s">We</a>  went and had discussions with the library administration and some of you joined us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1002.606s">I</a>  don't know if people know but based on those discussions and the fact that the library really wanted to help us, the special education in school, the school special education department went to the library, and they had <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1016.505s">A</a>  training, yes, on disability awareness. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1019.386s">And</a>  then the library now, if you are applying for their programs, there is actually automatically they're asking you, do you need accommodation, which is an amazing thing that happened because of this advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1030.612s">So</a>  what I'm trying to say is that this person needs to serve different spots in the city, not only the recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1038.216s">We</a>  need them at the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1039.356s">We</a>  need them in different <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1041.437s">places</a>  and we need all the people who want to help our community and organize things for us to have access to this person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1048.442s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1050.543s">And</a>  the last thing that I want to say, do I have to say my name again? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1053.304s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1053.625s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1054.425s">The</a>  last thing would be just, just a reminder that we have people with disabilities in this city from zero to 99. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1061.329s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1062.89s">That's</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1063.591s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1064.872s">So</a>  I, I, I think that I appreciate, um, I appreciate the discussions we've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1070.715s">Patricia,</a>  I appreciate what my fellow colleagues, I know that Councilor Callahan and Councilor Leming really took the leadership role with this and moving it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1080.885s">So,</a>  and then coming out that evening to bring this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1084.648s">Now,</a>  as I will speak as a City Councilor for the City of Medford, who is the chairperson that brought a full-time recreation department to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1095.056s">When</a>  we started that program under Mayor Burke at the time, we really wanted to focus that when we started, it was really a very thin program when it talked about staffing, funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1112.368s">It</a>  was really supposed to be a self-sustaining program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1114.79s">And</a>  as we move forward, we were supposed to have been growing with our community and enhancing programs like we're talking about tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1125.873s">We're</a>  in a position I think that where we met the city council and all of our council members felt that we felt strong so strong about this that looking at that position is very important in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1139.849s">But</a>  the, the recreation department is that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1145.505s">Like</a>  I said, we might not have been happy with how things have gone in the past, but I think that I can speak of what I've seen as a resident of Medford is that we've had some hurdles because of limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1159.651s">And</a>  this is why starting this meeting off right and saying, OK, having our programs, having a leader like Kevin, working with a parent organization that we can craft together, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1175.993s">work</a>  for zero to 99. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1177.894s">Because</a>  that's what the recreation department's for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1180.655s">The</a>  recreation department isn't about sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1182.775s">I</a>  know, unfortunately, it seems like it's been the Saturday three o'clock to four o'clock program, but I think tonight you'll hear some pretty exciting stories and plans that we have to move forward with, not just sports programs, but other programs that we're looking to enhance our programs for our families. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1199.281s">But</a>  being a city program, a city department, we're that conduit <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1205.327s">to</a>  the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1206.207s">We're</a>  the conduit to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1208.288s">We're</a>  going to bring all that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1209.649s">So</a>  at least that's how I feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1212.97s">I'll</a>  call on my colleagues, but if we can, I think you have something to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1219.492s">Sure,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1227.94s">Tanya</a>  Sullivan, 19 Brackett Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1230.703s">I</a>  would like to kind of get clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1234.366s">If</a>  that's the only place where this inclusion specialist can be housed, how will the funding filter and how will the time filter for different <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1249.134s">parts</a>  of the city, and not just recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1255.501s">Like</a>  I had said before, I want to make sure that we're talking well-rounded inclusion specialists. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1263.33s">Can</a>  people with disabilities get to this room, and can they understand what's being said, et cetera? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1270.257s">So</a>  just looking at all aspects, and I understand what you're saying, that that position needs to be housed somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1280.747s">What</a>  are the other options on where it can be housed?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1284.51s">Again,</a>  right now this is still a position that we have to petition to the mayor and go through the process, and hopefully that's going to be part of the discussion as we move forward where <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1297.036s">the</a>  mayor is the ultimate authority in the city deems to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1300.419s">So</a>  I think that's going to be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1302.101s">But</a>  I think tonight is really just have that discussion to get all that information out that then we can report back to the mayor and the council and we can move forward.</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1311.357s">I</a>  think, yeah, I think that's great, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1312.878s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1313.639s">We</a>  just want to know that there are options and who has the final say, and we just want to make sure that, you know, after years of, you know, being in an afterthought position, we want to make sure that we're doing this right and that we're guiding you guys as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1331.212s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1331.772s">In</a>  the right direction.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1332.513s">We</a>  appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1333.593s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1335.418s">And</a>  to add to that, we also wanna make sure that when this is done, there is accountability if it doesn't go right on where the parents have some, what happens a lot with us is we're told, okay, this is the program we can run, this is what we decided is best, and this is what, you don't know what's best.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1356.387s">So</a>  again, I'll say it again like we started, that's yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1360.009s">The</a>  hope is as we're here tonight, the hope is that we, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1364.928s">I'm</a>  a program developer for a city that gives me the opportunity to do a lot of great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1369.83s">But</a>  we know we can't, I don't make the decisions, because I don't know what different demographics need in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1376.673s">So</a>  this is where we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1378.014s">This</a>  is where the start, it's going to be the start, at least how I feel, is the start of something amazing where parents will work with the recreation department, the leadership team there, and whatever piece we do get, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1390.97s">and</a>  move that forward together because we can make, we're not, at least I, as a city councilor, I'm not going to do a program just to check a box. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1400.954s">That's</a>  not, that's not the way I do things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1403.175s">We're</a>  not checking boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1404.635s">That's</a>  why we're doing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1405.455s">That's</a>  why we're having this meeting.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1406.816s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1407.016s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1408.096s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1409.057s">So</a>  I know that Councilor Callahan, uh, and then Councilor</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1413.781s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1414.822s">So,</a>  I appreciate so much that you're here again, I was there at the library with you and I was with, you know, with one of your very first meetings with Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1423.549s">I,</a>  I really have heard from you guys very clearly that this is not about just rec programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1430.995s">I</a>  loved the way that you phrased it about it including restaurants and places of worship and meetings and events, live entertainment, holidays, employment, the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1440.719s">There's</a>  so many things that we could be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1444.2s">My</a>  volunteer team has found a volunteer who is a specialist in special ed, both in her work and in her education. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1452.803s">And</a>  what I'm hoping we can do is set up a meeting where <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1460.224s">the</a>  group and this volunteer and I can all meet together because I believe that she has volunteered to do 20 to 40 hours over the next few months, and budget season is coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1474.551s">So</a>  if she can pull on all these threads and find out and do the legwork that the mayor is gonna want to hear, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1483.375s">about</a>  what this is actually going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1487.66s">She</a>  can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1488.641s">She</a>  wants to volunteer to do that, then we'll be able to have something that is much more concrete for the mayor to approve of in budget season. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1497.751s">So</a>  this is where I think this volunteer is going to be really incredibly helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1503.157s">is</a>  to hear all of the ways, all of the ideas that you guys have and the ways that Medford could be like this, you know, the inclusion specialist that you want to be housed somewhere in the city, the ways that that person could bring these kinds of activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1520.555s">And</a>  that way, she can do the legwork <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1523.077s">to</a>  ensure that the mayor feels comfortable with funding this position and also where in the budget and where this person should be housed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1532.62s">I</a>  think having that volunteer do that legwork before budget season is the way that we're gonna be able to have this placed in the best place that you guys feel comfortable with it being funded in the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1548.525s">If</a>  you can.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1554.518s">Well,</a>  I think my suggestion has been that we meet with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1560.103s">Well,</a>  I would love to see her here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1563.085s">I</a>  don't know if she's coming tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1565.287s">I</a>  think we need to have like a deeper, like her hearing this meeting would be great, but having a deeper discussion where she can really dig in and ask tons of questions to you guys, that's going to be a lot deeper than this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1577.717s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1583.851s">But</a>  let's set up a meeting where I can be there, she can be there, we can make sure that we get this off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1588.873s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1590.373s">All</a>  set? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1591.454s">Yeah,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1591.894s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1592.574s">Council</a>  Beas.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1594.475s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1596.796s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think what we're talking about here is continuing an effort that has borne some fruit and needs to bear more fruit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1607.907s">I</a>  think ideally, right, we would have enough of a budget where you could have an inclusion specialist in all the relevant departments and someone to coordinate all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1615.89s">That's</a>  a system that I think everyone would support because you'd have the level of resources that, quite frankly, other communities have, neighboring communities, but those are also communities with more money in their city budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1629.694s">And</a>  I think sometimes when we have these conversations about <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1636.668s">addressing</a>  urgent needs and where the resources should be placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1641.89s">You</a>  know, I don't think anyone disagrees that the Recreation Department needs more staff and support. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1646.012s">I</a>  don't think anyone disagrees that we need a citywide approach and citywide staffing to address inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1650.694s">But</a>  I think the question is, what is the system that you build with the resources that you have now that is a foundation? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1659.978s">And</a>  then what <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1661.62s">How</a>  do you then grow that with more resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1664.581s">I</a>  don't have the answer to that question, but I think that that is the path, that's the way like I would like to think about and frame it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1678.808s">on</a>  the issue of inclusion, maybe starting with someone in the inclusion office or someone in the mayor's office that has that citywide scope. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1691.032s">If</a>  we're talking about, there's only one person that this budget's going to be able to support in addition to who we have now, that to me might be the approach because then you have someone who could work with recreation library <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1704.802s">liaise</a>  with the schools, work with other offices, and identify, okay, we really need this type of support staff in this department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1713.81s">This</a>  department maybe doesn't need a whole staff person, I can work with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1718.153s">And</a>  you can flesh out that person, their role would be to work across all of the departments of the city and work with the private businesses and the other agencies of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1732.661s">to</a>  maximize the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1734.562s">And</a>  I think that would be something that I would be interested in looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1738.045s">And</a>  that's not to say I don't think that the Recreation Department budget is too small, because I definitely do think it's too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1745.711s">If</a>  we can find a solution on both of those questions this year, or some step forward on both of those questions this year, I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1756.339s">But</a>  when we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1759.17s">Access</a>  to job opportunities for adults with disabilities access to economic opportunities in general, when we're talking about programming and resources that goes beyond the school department school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1774.367s">It</a>  just seems to me that someone who could bring together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1777.572s">all</a>  of the different parts of the city who could be working with the economic development director and the recreation department and the school system and the library would be the staff person to start with, but.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1800.457s">You</a>  know, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1801.417s">Cause</a>  this is what we get a lot too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1803.397s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1803.697s">Well,</a>  I found this really great group and here's the link.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1806.658s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1807.741s">that</a>  we get that all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1809.362s">We</a>  don't want that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1810.803s">It</a>  doesn't need to, we already have an inclusion specialist that we got from the school committee that's going to be hired for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1816.748s">So</a>  it would be somebody in addition to work with them.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1819.55s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1819.93s">So</a>  we're talking about someone who's on the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1823.133s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1823.733s">Boots</a>  on the ground.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1824.594s">Boots</a>  on the ground who can be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1827.296s">But</a>  the concern then being if it's housed in one department, are they spending 90% of their time on that when maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1834.248s">Yeah,</a>  I'm not saying on purpose, just because of the inherent nature of the structure, right?</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1838.39s">Yes,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1839.231s">And</a>  so that's our concern, where that's been a pigeonhole. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1845.414s">Whether</a>  it's intentional or not, mostly not, if that person is housed there, that's where they're going to be, and that's where most of the focus is going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1855.7s">And</a>  if you're looking at the percentage of folks in the city that have disabilities, are you really <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1863.125s">helping</a>  everybody, or are you just helping kids be able to play peripherally?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1871.092s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1871.953s">If</a>  the supports aren't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1873.434s">And</a>  I'm not like, I know that what you're doing, George, because I have nothing but amazing things to say about the programs that you run. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1882.086s">We</a>  want to make sure it's not a managerial position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1884.348s">We</a>  want to make sure it's housed in a place that isn't pigeonholing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1890.472s">We</a>  want to make sure that we have a seat at the table so that we know when the funds filter down and when the timelines filter down. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1896.877s">Like,</a>  is time being spent in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1899.099s">Is</a>  time being spent in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1900.46s">Is</a>  time being spent in the parks? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1902.321s">You</a>  know, if they have an Easter egg hunt at Cornwall Stadium, can somebody in a wheelchair, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1908.732s">go</a>  hunt for Easter eggs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1909.733s">So</a>  just like, you know, there's so many different aspects that an inclusion specialist needs to address in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1918.257s">Let's</a>  be honest.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1920.358s">There's</a>  also, there's a lot of people in this city that, as she can tell you, because we took her and Matt on our journey with us, where they thought it was just gonna be, they told us, oh, just go to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1930.223s">I'm</a>  sure they can host this for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1931.604s">I</a>  said, okay, come with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1933.204s">We</a>  got to the library and they figured out really quick that, oh, it's not that easy, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1938.711s">But</a>  all these places want to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1942.536s">But</a>  there's nobody to get all these places together to help.</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1945.58s">And</a>  there's nobody to guide them on how to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1950.406s">And</a>  so that's more of.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1952.41s">So</a>  why we want to be an inclusion specialist at the med for rec. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1955.652s">Okay,</a>  well, they also going to be able to go over to the library and spend some time over there and help them figure out some of their programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1962.577s">Would</a>  they also be able to go down to talk to the inclusion specialist that's going to be hired next year at the public school and say, okay, how can we coordinate some of that type of</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1972.963s">are</a>  they going to be able to go to Temple and see if there needs to be somebody doing sign language? <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1977.605s">I</a>  mean, there's just, it's vast. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1980.067s">And</a>  when you're a parent of it, it's all you think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1982.688s">We</a>  have resources up the wazoo, but resources don't do a lot of them for anything.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1989.071s">This</a>  is why we're here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1991.852s">And</a>  I wonder, to that point, we have the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1996.855s">And</a>  I think the purpose of that office is <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=1999.846s">to</a>  be across the city, right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2002.269s">It</a>  is to be across the city and she's wonderful with resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2005.974s">She's</a>  wonderful with resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2007.376s">She</a>  sends me a lot of resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2009.019s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2009.359s">And</a>  I'm wondering if that's the next step. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2011.262s">I'm</a>  putting it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2012.163s">I'm</a>  not saying make the <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2014.834s">None</a>  of us, we will all work together to get someone else to make a decision.</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2019.677s">I</a>  think as long as we have a seat at the table and helping to decide or see where the inclusion specialist ends up being housed, that's what's important to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2032.643s">And</a>  only because, you know, we've, this is not our first rodeo.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2039.327s">Yeah,</a>  no, I get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2041.908s">And</a>  the reason I bring up that office though is that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2044.538s">You</a>  have a manager of the office who has access to a lot of resources, but not a lot of ability to implement on the ground because the staff isn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2050.642s">But</a>  you also don't have, if it sounds like a concern, I don't want to put words in your mouth, of wanting this person to be able to go across different programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2061.809s">And</a>  I bet REC could use a full-time person 100% of the time for inclusion specialists, but the issue being if we only have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2070.635s">It</a>  doesn't hit all those other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2072.076s">So</a>  that's why I just throw out that idea, because it is kind of, in a sense, I think the office is intended to be that office that can go across.</p>

    <p>[ZOridbGJ9hA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2079.438s">I</a>  think that's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2081.339s">And</a>  this is kind of the back and forth that we want to have, the conversation that we want to have, because there are other places to house that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2090.282s">And</a>  I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2092.793s">That's</a>  a great thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2094.555s">Now</a>  we have the DEI department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZG6Mf3yqBkQ&t=2096.497s">So,</a>  you know, let's let's think outside the box, even more.</p>
