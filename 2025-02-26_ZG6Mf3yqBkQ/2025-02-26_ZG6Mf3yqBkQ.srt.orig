1
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:29,197
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to turn your... You can hear me?

2
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:30,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

3
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:32,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Zach, now I know exactly how you feel.

4
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:34,341
[SPEAKER_09]: So powerful.

5
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Just swing the gavel down to the right, not the left.

6
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:39,202
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't.

7
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good evening, everyone.

8
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:48,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for joining us this evening for our subcommittee on education and cultural committee today, February 25th, 2025.

9
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Will our clerk call the roll, please?

10
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:57,686
[SPEAKER_08]: President Bares.

11
00:08:57,726 --> 00:08:58,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Present.

12
00:08:58,626 --> 00:08:59,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

13
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:00,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Present.

14
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:00,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

15
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:01,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Present.

16
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:06,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Seng, his informant is gonna be a little bit late.

17
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chair, Scott Kelly.

18
00:09:07,935 --> 00:09:08,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

19
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:14,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, four present, one showing up soon.

20
00:09:16,277 --> 00:09:17,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's move forward if we can.

21
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:27,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is, we're here to discuss Resolution 25-027, Resolution to Discuss Recreation Department Programs for Youth with Disabilities.

22
00:09:28,782 --> 00:09:29,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the committee

23
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:47,993
[SPEAKER_09]: on education and culture schedule a meeting on February 25 at six o'clock city council chambers, the committee will discuss the needs of the recreation department for the upcoming budget season, and the committee will also discuss the recreational programs involving our disabled community if I can, if you can all allow me.

24
00:09:48,513 --> 00:10:10,666
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like if my fellow counselors, because the parents are the reason why we're here, I think that it would behoove us to have them speak and just share with us because part of this discussion is starting a new slate here at Medford with recreation, our leadership team, and looking into making sure that we have a partnership

25
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:25,072
[SPEAKER_09]: with our parents, the recreation department, and the city leadership to make sure that we can follow through for our wishes for our families, disabled families here in Medford.

26
00:10:25,112 --> 00:10:27,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So would anybody like to kick it off?

27
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:28,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on up.

28
00:10:31,796 --> 00:10:31,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.

29
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:37,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and... Nice to see you, my friend.

30
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,160
[SPEAKER_09]: We sure do.

31
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:49,345
[SPEAKER_07]: You're up.

32
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:49,726
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on.

33
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:50,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm on.

34
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:51,026
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

35
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:59,230
[SPEAKER_04]: So I kind of wanted to kind of give a little synopsis of the vision of it through parents' eyes.

36
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:10,996
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that you have heard a lot of this, but I've been a parent now from toddler to elementary to middle to high school to transition program and forward.

37
00:11:12,599 --> 00:11:20,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as, you know, I know the conversation was that Medford didn't really offer a lot of activities for our kids.

38
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:26,324
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of our kids have to go out of town to be able to participate in activities, as my child did.

39
00:11:26,464 --> 00:11:29,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And even with you, George, we went to Summerville, and it was an amazing program.

40
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,766
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll never forget that.

41
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:32,787
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.

42
00:11:34,187 --> 00:11:45,060
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to just I want to take a minute to be honest, when our kids currently participate in inclusive activities in Medford, it's intermittent best it's when the supports are available.

43
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:51,107
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's often taking part in a peripheral manner kind of like a parallel position.

44
00:11:52,216 --> 00:12:00,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So the full inclusivity would be our kids participating as all the other kids do because the necessary supports would just automatically be there in Medford, right?

45
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's our goal.

46
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:06,407
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we want and that's what we're working towards together as a team.

47
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:08,369
[SPEAKER_04]: We're realistic.

48
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,373
[SPEAKER_04]: We know how hard it is to get sufficient staff and train them.

49
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:24,518
[SPEAKER_04]: and it doesn't make it any less important and it doesn't provide a reason for us to need to be grateful that Medford tried when the support staff or training isn't there.

50
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:34,750
[SPEAKER_04]: As an example, if a business is putting out a product, right, for a customer and that product or the way it's produced or the timing doesn't work,

51
00:12:36,054 --> 00:12:38,596
[SPEAKER_04]: The customer work for the customer.

52
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,437
[SPEAKER_04]: The business doesn't say, well, we tried.

53
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,761
[SPEAKER_04]: They make the necessary changes to modify the product or its production so that it works for everyone.

54
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:52,246
[SPEAKER_04]: In simpler words, when a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower.

55
00:12:57,671 --> 00:12:58,711
[SPEAKER_04]: With all that being said,

56
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:24,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Our thought about placing the citywide inclusion specialist under med rec because the position needs to be housed somewhere is a little bit low key pigeonholing those services to mostly recreation, which is obviously like a really small part of the city experience and the small part of the city that would get to realize the improvements as opposed to citywide by definition.

57
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,725
[SPEAKER_04]: And while not trying to sound ungrateful,

58
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:34,863
[SPEAKER_04]: We as parents don't always wanna have to be grateful that there are programs for our kids in Medford, it should be a given.

59
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:41,148
[SPEAKER_04]: My kid turns 21 in three weeks.

60
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:46,732
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am now kind of past the med rec perspective.

61
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:58,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the activities may not be of interest to him at this point and that's okay because a citywide inclusion specialist would make other aspects of the city more inclusive for people his age and older and for what they might like to do.

62
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:04,057
[SPEAKER_04]: The initial request was for an inclusion specialist for the city.

63
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:32,040
[SPEAKER_04]: to look at recreation, transportation, the library, the post office, restaurants, grocery stores, police and fire stations, hospitals, banks, art centers, places of worship, parks, pathways, ponds, voting centers, city council and school committee meetings, celebrations in Medford, Medford events, venues with live entertainment, local craft fairs, holiday celebrations, farmers markets, employment opportunities, just to name a few.

64
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,755
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically every aspect of what makes a city a city, right?

65
00:14:37,716 --> 00:14:42,439
[SPEAKER_04]: We would ask that there be more options provided for where the inclusion specialist can be housed.

66
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,682
[SPEAKER_04]: As we know, MedRec is not the only department available.

67
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:56,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And because our kids with disabilities grew up to be adults with disabilities, wouldn't it be great if they could navigate the city more easily because the inclusion specialist helped in all areas for all stages of life.

68
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:57,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

69
00:14:58,771 --> 00:14:59,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

70
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:15,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Patricia Cherry, I know we have had multiple conversations and I am so appreciative like you are just so enthusiastic and wanting to get out there and wanting to help.

71
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:19,535
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is this is my first time working with you.

72
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:23,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm super excited about everything that you had spoken about.

73
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:34,044
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that we're a little bit nervous because where you're trying to bring it back to is someplace that we didn't have great success at.

74
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did reach out, we did try.

75
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:39,067
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was staffing issues.

76
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:44,491
[SPEAKER_03]: We would try to reach out and try to set something up and let's get something going and we can help here and we wanna do.

77
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:47,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was just no want or desire there.

78
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:56,547
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just afraid that we fought this hard to get this position even spoken about, that we want to get it right.

79
00:15:57,027 --> 00:16:03,788
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want it to be just another 3 to 4 PM on a Saturday program.

80
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:07,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be bigger.

81
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,809
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be citywide.

82
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:14,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where we're at.

83
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:14,970
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, thank you.

84
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I want to stress that.

85
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,298
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address.

86
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:20,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Alexandra Lorig, station manager, 75.

87
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,019
[SPEAKER_11]: I just did.

88
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:34,423
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say that we are really looking and we really need a citywide position because our experience is that when we talk with people and ask, they really want to help.

89
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,044
[SPEAKER_11]: And one example is the library.

90
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:40,585
[SPEAKER_11]: We went and had discussions with the library administration and some of you joined us.

91
00:16:42,606 --> 00:16:54,500
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if people know but based on those discussions and the fact that the library really wanted to help us, the special education in school, the school special education department went to the library, and they had

92
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:58,986
[SPEAKER_11]: A training, yes, on disability awareness.

93
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:09,812
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the library now, if you are applying for their programs, there is actually automatically they're asking you, do you need accommodation, which is an amazing thing that happened because of this advocacy.

94
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:18,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I'm trying to say is that this person needs to serve different spots in the city, not only the recreation.

95
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,296
[SPEAKER_11]: We need them at the library.

96
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,497
[SPEAKER_11]: We need them in different

97
00:17:21,437 --> 00:17:27,841
[SPEAKER_11]: places and we need all the people who want to help our community and organize things for us to have access to this person.

98
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:28,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

99
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:33,184
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last thing that I want to say, do I have to say my name again?

100
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:33,525
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

101
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:33,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

102
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:41,169
[SPEAKER_04]: The last thing would be just, just a reminder that we have people with disabilities in this city from zero to 99.

103
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:41,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

104
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,171
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

105
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:44,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

106
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:50,075
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, I, I think that I appreciate, um, I appreciate the discussions we've had.

107
00:17:50,715 --> 00:18:00,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Patricia, I appreciate what my fellow colleagues, I know that Councilor Callahan and Councilor Lemming really took the leadership role with this and moving it forward.

108
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:04,188
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and then coming out that evening to bring this forward.

109
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:13,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, as I will speak as a City Councilor for the City of Medford, who is the chairperson that brought a full-time recreation department to the City of Medford.

110
00:18:15,056 --> 00:18:31,688
[SPEAKER_09]: When we started that program under Mayor Burke at the time, we really wanted to focus that when we started, it was really a very thin program when it talked about staffing, funding.

111
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:34,390
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really supposed to be a self-sustaining program.

112
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:44,257
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we move forward, we were supposed to have been growing with our community and enhancing programs like we're talking about tonight.

113
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:58,887
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in a position I think that where we met the city council and all of our council members felt that we felt strong so strong about this that looking at that position is very important in our community.

114
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:03,693
[SPEAKER_09]: But the, the recreation department is that department.

115
00:19:05,505 --> 00:19:19,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, we might not have been happy with how things have gone in the past, but I think that I can speak of what I've seen as a resident of Medford is that we've had some hurdles because of limitations.

116
00:19:19,651 --> 00:19:34,217
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is why starting this meeting off right and saying, OK, having our programs, having a leader like Kevin, working with a parent organization that we can craft together, and then

117
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,754
[SPEAKER_09]: work for zero to 99.

118
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:40,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's what the recreation department's for.

119
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:42,735
[SPEAKER_09]: The recreation department isn't about sports.

120
00:19:42,775 --> 00:19:58,621
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, unfortunately, it seems like it's been the Saturday three o'clock to four o'clock program, but I think tonight you'll hear some pretty exciting stories and plans that we have to move forward with, not just sports programs, but other programs that we're looking to enhance our programs for our families.

121
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:04,723
[SPEAKER_09]: But being a city program, a city department, we're that conduit

122
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:06,127
[SPEAKER_09]: to the library.

123
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,628
[SPEAKER_09]: We're the conduit to the schools.

124
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:09,529
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to bring all that together.

125
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:12,610
[SPEAKER_09]: So at least that's how I feel.

126
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:19,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll call on my colleagues, but if we can, I think you have something to add.

127
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, yeah.

128
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Tanya Sullivan, 19 Brackett Street.

129
00:20:30,703 --> 00:20:33,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to kind of get clarification.

130
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:48,139
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's the only place where this inclusion specialist can be housed, how will the funding filter and how will the time filter for different

131
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:54,860
[SPEAKER_04]: parts of the city, and not just recreation.

132
00:20:55,501 --> 00:21:02,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I had said before, I want to make sure that we're talking well-rounded inclusion specialists.

133
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Can people with disabilities get to this room, and can they understand what's being said, et cetera?

134
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:19,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So just looking at all aspects, and I understand what you're saying, that that position needs to be housed somewhere.

135
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,749
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the other options on where it can be housed?

136
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:34,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, right now this is still a position that we have to petition to the mayor and go through the process, and hopefully that's going to be part of the discussion as we move forward where

137
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:40,319
[SPEAKER_09]: the mayor is the ultimate authority in the city deems to be.

138
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:42,081
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's going to be important.

139
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:50,750
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think tonight is really just have that discussion to get all that information out that then we can report back to the mayor and the council and we can move forward.

140
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:52,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, yeah, I think that's great, George.

141
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:53,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

142
00:21:53,639 --> 00:22:11,192
[SPEAKER_04]: We just want to know that there are options and who has the final say, and we just want to make sure that, you know, after years of, you know, being in an afterthought position, we want to make sure that we're doing this right and that we're guiding you guys as well.

143
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:11,752
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.

144
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:12,493
[SPEAKER_04]: In the right direction.

145
00:22:12,513 --> 00:22:13,573
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate that.

146
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:14,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thanks.

147
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:36,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And to add to that, we also wanna make sure that when this is done, there is accountability if it doesn't go right on where the parents have some, what happens a lot with us is we're told, okay, this is the program we can run, this is what we decided is best, and this is what, you don't know what's best.

148
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:39,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, I'll say it again like we started, that's yesterday.

149
00:22:40,009 --> 00:22:42,570
[SPEAKER_09]: The hope is as we're here tonight, the hope is that we,

150
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:49,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a program developer for a city that gives me the opportunity to do a lot of great things.

151
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:56,233
[SPEAKER_09]: But we know we can't, I don't make the decisions, because I don't know what different demographics need in our community.

152
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:57,994
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is where we are today.

153
00:22:58,014 --> 00:23:10,159
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where the start, it's going to be the start, at least how I feel, is the start of something amazing where parents will work with the recreation department, the leadership team there, and whatever piece we do get,

154
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:20,234
[SPEAKER_09]: and move that forward together because we can make, we're not, at least I, as a city councilor, I'm not going to do a program just to check a box.

155
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:23,055
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not, that's not the way I do things.

156
00:23:23,175 --> 00:23:24,075
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not checking boxes.

157
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:25,435
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we're doing this.

158
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:26,356
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we're having this meeting.

159
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:26,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

160
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:27,276
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

161
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:28,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

162
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:32,098
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that Councilor Callahan, uh, and then Councilor

163
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:34,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

164
00:23:34,822 --> 00:23:42,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I appreciate so much that you're here again, I was there at the library with you and I was with, you know, with one of your very first meetings with counselor lemming.

165
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:50,275
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I really have heard from you guys very clearly that this is not about just rec programs.

166
00:23:50,995 --> 00:24:00,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved the way that you phrased it about it including restaurants and places of worship and meetings and events, live entertainment, holidays, employment, the library.

167
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:03,280
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many things that we could be doing.

168
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:12,163
[SPEAKER_02]: My volunteer team has found a volunteer who is a specialist in special ed, both in her work and in her education.

169
00:24:12,803 --> 00:24:17,685
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm hoping we can do is set up a meeting where

170
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:34,051
[SPEAKER_02]: the group and this volunteer and I can all meet together because I believe that she has volunteered to do 20 to 40 hours over the next few months, and budget season is coming up.

171
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:42,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So if she can pull on all these threads and find out and do the legwork that the mayor is gonna want to hear,

172
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:47,440
[SPEAKER_02]: about what this is actually going to look like.

173
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,521
[SPEAKER_02]: She can do that.

174
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:57,731
[SPEAKER_02]: She wants to volunteer to do that, then we'll be able to have something that is much more concrete for the mayor to approve of in budget season.

175
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:02,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where I think this volunteer is going to be really incredibly helpful.

176
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:19,213
[SPEAKER_02]: is to hear all of the ways, all of the ideas that you guys have and the ways that Medford could be like this, you know, the inclusion specialist that you want to be housed somewhere in the city, the ways that that person could bring these kinds of activities.

177
00:25:20,555 --> 00:25:22,577
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way, she can do the legwork

178
00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:32,520
[SPEAKER_02]: to ensure that the mayor feels comfortable with funding this position and also where in the budget and where this person should be housed.

179
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:44,504
[SPEAKER_02]: I think having that volunteer do that legwork before budget season is the way that we're gonna be able to have this placed in the best place that you guys feel comfortable with it being funded in the city of Medford.

180
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:46,844
Yes.

181
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:48,945
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can.

182
00:25:54,518 --> 00:25:58,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think my suggestion has been that we meet with her.

183
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:03,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would love to see her here.

184
00:26:03,085 --> 00:26:04,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if she's coming tonight.

185
00:26:05,287 --> 00:26:15,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to have like a deeper, like her hearing this meeting would be great, but having a deeper discussion where she can really dig in and ask tons of questions to you guys, that's going to be a lot deeper than this meeting.

186
00:26:17,717 --> 00:26:17,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

187
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:27,993
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's set up a meeting where I can be there, she can be there, we can make sure that we get this off.

188
00:26:28,873 --> 00:26:29,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

189
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:30,954
[SPEAKER_09]: All set?

190
00:26:31,454 --> 00:26:31,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks.

191
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:32,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

192
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:33,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Beas.

193
00:26:34,475 --> 00:26:35,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

194
00:26:36,796 --> 00:26:43,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I think what we're talking about here is continuing an effort that has borne some fruit and needs to bear more fruit.

195
00:26:47,907 --> 00:26:55,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I think ideally, right, we would have enough of a budget where you could have an inclusion specialist in all the relevant departments and someone to coordinate all of them.

196
00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:07,734
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a system that I think everyone would support because you'd have the level of resources that, quite frankly, other communities have, neighboring communities, but those are also communities with more money in their city budgets.

197
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:14,776
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think sometimes when we have these conversations about

198
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:20,230
[SPEAKER_07]: addressing urgent needs and where the resources should be placed.

199
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,972
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't think anyone disagrees that the Recreation Department needs more staff and support.

200
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:30,674
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think anyone disagrees that we need a citywide approach and citywide staffing to address inclusion.

201
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:39,958
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the question is, what is the system that you build with the resources that you have now that is a foundation?

202
00:27:39,978 --> 00:27:40,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what

203
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,661
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you then grow that with more resources.

204
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:51,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have the answer to that question, but I think that that is the path, that's the way like I would like to think about and frame it.

205
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:10,312
[SPEAKER_07]: on the issue of inclusion, maybe starting with someone in the inclusion office or someone in the mayor's office that has that citywide scope.

206
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:23,817
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're talking about, there's only one person that this budget's going to be able to support in addition to who we have now, that to me might be the approach because then you have someone who could work with recreation library

207
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:33,349
[SPEAKER_07]: liaise with the schools, work with other offices, and identify, okay, we really need this type of support staff in this department.

208
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,392
[SPEAKER_07]: This department maybe doesn't need a whole staff person, I can work with them.

209
00:28:38,153 --> 00:28:50,123
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can flesh out that person, their role would be to work across all of the departments of the city and work with the private businesses and the other agencies of the city.

210
00:28:52,661 --> 00:28:54,462
[SPEAKER_07]: to maximize the impact.

211
00:28:54,562 --> 00:28:57,825
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that would be something that I would be interested in looking at.

212
00:28:58,045 --> 00:29:04,150
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not to say I don't think that the Recreation Department budget is too small, because I definitely do think it's too small.

213
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:14,337
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can find a solution on both of those questions this year, or some step forward on both of those questions this year, I think that's great.

214
00:29:16,339 --> 00:29:17,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we're talking about

215
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:32,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Access to job opportunities for adults with disabilities access to economic opportunities in general, when we're talking about programming and resources that goes beyond the school department school system.

216
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:36,509
[SPEAKER_07]: It just seems to me that someone who could bring together.

217
00:29:37,572 --> 00:29:48,854
[SPEAKER_07]: all of the different parts of the city who could be working with the economic development director and the recreation department and the school system and the library would be the staff person to start with, but.

218
00:30:00,457 --> 00:30:01,277
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, okay.

219
00:30:01,417 --> 00:30:02,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause this is what we get a lot too.

220
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:03,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

221
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:06,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I found this really great group and here's the link.

222
00:30:06,658 --> 00:30:06,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

223
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:09,182
[SPEAKER_03]: that we get that all the time.

224
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:10,503
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want that either.

225
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:16,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't need to, we already have an inclusion specialist that we got from the school committee that's going to be hired for next year.

226
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,070
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be somebody in addition to work with them.

227
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:19,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

228
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,113
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about someone who's on the ground.

229
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:23,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

230
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:24,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Boots on the ground.

231
00:30:24,594 --> 00:30:26,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Boots on the ground who can be moved.

232
00:30:27,296 --> 00:30:32,540
[SPEAKER_07]: But the concern then being if it's housed in one department, are they spending 90% of their time on that when maybe

233
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:38,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm not saying on purpose, just because of the inherent nature of the structure, right?

234
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes.

235
00:30:39,231 --> 00:30:44,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's our concern, where that's been a pigeonhole.

236
00:30:45,414 --> 00:30:55,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it's intentional or not, mostly not, if that person is housed there, that's where they're going to be, and that's where most of the focus is going to go.

237
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:02,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're looking at the percentage of folks in the city that have disabilities, are you really

238
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:10,171
[SPEAKER_04]: helping everybody, or are you just helping kids be able to play peripherally?

239
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:11,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

240
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,114
[SPEAKER_04]: If the supports aren't there.

241
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:20,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not like, I know that what you're doing, George, because I have nothing but amazing things to say about the programs that you run.

242
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:24,308
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure it's not a managerial position.

243
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:30,292
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure it's housed in a place that isn't pigeonholing it.

244
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:36,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure that we have a seat at the table so that we know when the funds filter down and when the timelines filter down.

245
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:39,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is time being spent in the community?

246
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Is time being spent in this?

247
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Is time being spent in the parks?

248
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:47,765
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if they have an Easter egg hunt at Cornwall Stadium, can somebody in a wheelchair, you know,

249
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:49,652
[SPEAKER_04]: go hunt for Easter eggs.

250
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:57,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like, you know, there's so many different aspects that an inclusion specialist needs to address in Medford.

251
00:31:58,257 --> 00:31:58,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be honest.

252
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:10,203
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also, there's a lot of people in this city that, as she can tell you, because we took her and Matt on our journey with us, where they thought it was just gonna be, they told us, oh, just go to the library.

253
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:11,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they can host this for you.

254
00:32:11,604 --> 00:32:12,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, okay, come with us.

255
00:32:13,204 --> 00:32:18,007
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to the library and they figured out really quick that, oh, it's not that easy, you know?

256
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:21,214
[SPEAKER_03]: But all these places want to help.

257
00:32:22,536 --> 00:32:25,420
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's nobody to get all these places together to help.

258
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's nobody to guide them on how to do that.

259
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's more of.

260
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,612
[SPEAKER_03]: So why we want to be an inclusion specialist at the med for rec.

261
00:32:35,652 --> 00:32:42,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, they also going to be able to go over to the library and spend some time over there and help them figure out some of their programs.

262
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:52,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Would they also be able to go down to talk to the inclusion specialist that's going to be hired next year at the public school and say, okay, how can we coordinate some of that type of

263
00:32:52,963 --> 00:32:57,045
[SPEAKER_04]: are they going to be able to go to Temple and see if there needs to be somebody doing sign language?

264
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:59,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's just, it's vast.

265
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:02,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're a parent of it, it's all you think about.

266
00:33:02,688 --> 00:33:09,051
[SPEAKER_04]: We have resources up the wazoo, but resources don't do a lot of them for anything.

267
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:11,212
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why we're here.

268
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:16,795
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wonder, to that point, we have the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion office.

269
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:18,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the purpose of that office is

270
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:21,749
[SPEAKER_07]: to be across the city, right.

271
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:25,894
[SPEAKER_03]: It is to be across the city and she's wonderful with resources.

272
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:27,356
[SPEAKER_03]: She's wonderful with resources.

273
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:28,798
[SPEAKER_03]: She sends me a lot of resources.

274
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:29,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

275
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,202
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm wondering if that's the next step.

276
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:32,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm putting it out there.

277
00:33:32,163 --> 00:33:32,904
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying make the

278
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:38,856
[SPEAKER_07]: None of us, we will all work together to get someone else to make a decision.

279
00:33:39,677 --> 00:33:52,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as long as we have a seat at the table and helping to decide or see where the inclusion specialist ends up being housed, that's what's important to us.

280
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:59,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And only because, you know, we've, this is not our first rodeo.

281
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:01,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I get it.

282
00:34:01,908 --> 00:34:03,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason I bring up that office though is that

283
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:10,202
[SPEAKER_07]: You have a manager of the office who has access to a lot of resources, but not a lot of ability to implement on the ground because the staff isn't there.

284
00:34:10,642 --> 00:34:21,189
[SPEAKER_07]: But you also don't have, if it sounds like a concern, I don't want to put words in your mouth, of wanting this person to be able to go across different programming.

285
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:29,234
[SPEAKER_07]: And I bet REC could use a full-time person 100% of the time for inclusion specialists, but the issue being if we only have one.

286
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,056
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't hit all those other things.

287
00:34:32,076 --> 00:34:39,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I just throw out that idea, because it is kind of, in a sense, I think the office is intended to be that office that can go across.

288
00:34:39,438 --> 00:34:40,719
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a great suggestion.

289
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:50,262
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is kind of the back and forth that we want to have, the conversation that we want to have, because there are other places to house that position.

290
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:51,103
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that

291
00:34:52,793 --> 00:34:54,515
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great thought.

292
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:56,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have the DEI department.

293
00:34:56,497 --> 00:34:59,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, let's let's think outside the box, even more.

294
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:09,190
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know for one of Frances's biggest things talking to us, budget season or otherwise is, I'd love to be doing all this other stuff, but I feel like all I can do is give people, point them in a direction.

295
00:35:09,451 --> 00:35:09,651
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

296
00:35:09,671 --> 00:35:14,176
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think too, right, we have also, you know, someone to loop in here would be

297
00:35:15,888 --> 00:35:21,653
[SPEAKER_07]: or to think about too is the community affairs director Lisa in the mayor's office.

298
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:27,599
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why if you get the right person that's as enthusiastic as us parents are, that person will tie all these people.

299
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:31,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be so easy, but it has to be the right person.

300
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:34,685
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be a person that is wanting to get all.

301
00:35:34,885 --> 00:35:40,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just thinking off the top of my head to your point about manage versus like ability to implement and put the boots on the ground.

302
00:35:41,552 --> 00:35:48,580
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you have the director of diversity, equity, inclusion of director of community affairs, they have that kind of they can do the management piece.

303
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, have this person be able to be not doing all that.

304
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:55,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's our only concern is that if it's just with.

305
00:35:57,929 --> 00:36:01,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that person going to be allowed to go out and do these things in the community?

306
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:02,812
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the concern we have.

307
00:36:02,832 --> 00:36:05,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to fall into the parameters of the position being held?

308
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:06,853
[SPEAKER_03]: You bring up great questions.

309
00:36:07,194 --> 00:36:11,476
[SPEAKER_03]: In that position, that person being told by their boss, oh no, you can't go do that.

310
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,376
[SPEAKER_03]: We need you here.

311
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,577
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the concern.

312
00:36:14,237 --> 00:36:15,137
[SPEAKER_09]: You're bringing up great questions.

313
00:36:15,157 --> 00:36:15,758
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we hear.

314
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:17,078
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the things we want to hear.

315
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:21,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And Adam takes great, great notes, and we're going to break it down.

316
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,960
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Adam.

317
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:25,102
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, to that point, I think structurally right,

318
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:32,059
[SPEAKER_07]: even if you're allowed, you could use the whole time just on one department, right?

319
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,460
[SPEAKER_04]: You could use the whole time on each one of those departments.

320
00:36:36,881 --> 00:36:41,822
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I know that we're starting with baby steps, so we kind of need to share the wealth.

321
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:46,144
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to get so awesome at recreation and everything else is not awesome.

322
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:46,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

323
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:48,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything else is not even close to awesome.

324
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:49,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

325
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:56,171
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to move the needle, but we want to move it for the city of Medford, not just for this age group.

326
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:56,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

327
00:36:57,373 --> 00:36:58,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I think we've seen across the board.

328
00:37:03,547 --> 00:37:05,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean so let everybody else talk.

329
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:19,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just I just want to make the point that I think across the board it's like we've seen places of success and then places where they've been letdowns right and I think that's the, if we're not spreading the system, I'm sure more letdowns than not right and I'll let you know how it goes in adulthood.

330
00:37:19,595 --> 00:37:20,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

331
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:21,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm there.

332
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:23,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean that our first meeting we were talking about.

333
00:37:24,162 --> 00:37:37,886
[SPEAKER_07]: jobs, you know, what does it mean for someone to be able to have, you know, not just a job, but a job with a pipe, a pipeline and a growth opportunity to be able to live in Medford for a long time.

334
00:37:37,906 --> 00:37:38,786
[SPEAKER_04]: All kinds of conversations.

335
00:37:38,806 --> 00:37:42,227
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to have job carving at like the police station for volunteer visit.

336
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:46,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's, I mean, there's so many, all right, there's endless ideas.

337
00:37:46,108 --> 00:37:47,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll let you go.

338
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:48,249
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

339
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:49,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

340
00:37:49,989 --> 00:37:50,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

341
00:37:50,629 --> 00:37:52,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

342
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

343
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just so glad we're having this discussion.

344
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:13,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a lot has already been said about the point that I was kind of the thread that I was going to pick up next, which is, you know, I feel like the parents and the advocates in this discussion have described very, very clearly what success looks like.

345
00:38:14,948 --> 00:38:19,951
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are really far way away from that because what you're talking about is a fully accessible community.

346
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:25,495
[SPEAKER_10]: The fun stuff, the programming for youth, and the boring stuff and the stuff you have to do and the stuff that everybody has to do.

347
00:38:27,776 --> 00:38:32,759
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the events, the job pipeline, meetings like this, as well as the festivals.

348
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,442
[SPEAKER_10]: And we know how far we are from being able to

349
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:52,767
[SPEAKER_10]: We know how far we are in terms of capacity and people who are able to in the scope of their work in the city be laser focused on making sure that we start filling every one of those many, many, many gaps where we're not thinking about accessibility in all of these spaces.

350
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:59,091
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like our discussion is going in the right place and that we're thinking about what solutions can we

351
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:12,412
[SPEAKER_10]: On board for families and youth and all people quickly like what solutions, can we work on this year and this budget cycle to start things getting better and I think it's so important to make sure that we're.

352
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:25,344
[SPEAKER_10]: when we're talking about a staff person or in how we're just framing this conversation overall to make sure that we don't lose sight of what you all know that real success looks like, because that has to be the yardstick.

353
00:39:25,384 --> 00:39:39,392
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the yardstick for that is there's somebody central to the city's organizational chart that is holding every department and every venue accountable, even private spaces accountable to feeling fully accessible,

354
00:39:41,072 --> 00:39:48,278
[SPEAKER_10]: that needs to be protected position and we need to build to a place where we can have somebody who's going to ensure that that's the case in all departments and all spaces.

355
00:39:48,318 --> 00:39:49,939
[SPEAKER_10]: There's liaison for public businesses.

356
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:53,101
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I agree with everything that's been said.

357
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:54,502
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we're thinking about this in the right way.

358
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:58,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we makes a lot of sense to be thinking about this in terms of short term.

359
00:39:58,485 --> 00:40:04,550
[SPEAKER_10]: What can we do this year and what has to happen this year to kind of start that larger snowball in motion?

360
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what position do we need to get into the organizational chart this year that

361
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,773
[SPEAKER_10]: in five years is going to be a team of three and five years after that is going to be a team of 10.

362
00:40:16,274 --> 00:40:30,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish that we, you know, obviously we would all like that in three months, we'd be achieving these goals because this is stuff that people deserve already and have deserved already and we know that that would be naive to say that that is possible because we have such a long way to go.

363
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:33,345
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do think that part of this process needs to be

364
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:47,473
[SPEAKER_10]: some role or some type of project that is around kind of like an instant a, uh, a master plan for accessibility in the city, and I'd love to see that, um, not rolled into the boots on the ground implementation role that you're speaking about, because that's different.

365
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:52,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but I think that that has to be a protected mission statement in one of these roles as well.

366
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:54,517
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

367
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:01,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

368
00:41:02,262 --> 00:41:04,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, if I can't, uh,

369
00:41:04,499 --> 00:41:07,920
[SPEAKER_09]: We call on Councilor Lemming, who's from Zoom.

370
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chair Scarpelli.

371
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:22,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand that I'm not a voting member of this committee, so I do appreciate being given the opportunity to speak.

372
00:41:23,003 --> 00:41:27,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also like to apologize to folks, because I'm not there in person.

373
00:41:27,324 --> 00:41:28,905
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a bit under the weather now.

374
00:41:30,197 --> 00:41:36,265
[SPEAKER_06]: don't want to infect anybody with whatever cold I have.

375
00:41:36,365 --> 00:41:48,000
[SPEAKER_06]: But so I just like to say first that to Tanya's point that, and I understand Patricia was present for a few of these, but a lot of the conversations about

376
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:53,401
[SPEAKER_06]: where this could be housed were had behind closed doors.

377
00:41:53,481 --> 00:42:08,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the first idea was the library, which did lead to the meeting with the folks at the library thinking that we could, like thinking we could request to have them budget for more positions there.

378
00:42:08,585 --> 00:42:12,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they recommended to look into Francis's office.

379
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:17,727
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe there was some conversation between the mayor

380
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:28,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Lisa Crowley, I believe, and Francis about where something about the best place something like this could be housed.

381
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:45,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And ultimately, I did speak to Lisa about this and she did recommend and she recommended she thought that the position in Medford rec made the most sense, which Kevin Bailey did seem to.

382
00:42:46,663 --> 00:43:14,431
[SPEAKER_06]: did did seem to concur with like just in terms of what was being talked about at the time that just kind of seemed kind of seemed like it made the most sense so a lot of the Reason for choosing that is like I'm not necessarily married to the idea of this position being in Medford rec but it was the idea that at some point you do have to make a choice and that there's going to be Different benefits and drawbacks to housing this position in any particular place

383
00:43:16,312 --> 00:43:33,376
[SPEAKER_06]: So if somebody does want to have those conversations with city staff again, and they come to a different conclusion that it's best housed in Francis's office, then that could be a better pressure point to have.

384
00:43:33,496 --> 00:43:37,397
[SPEAKER_06]: But the conversations I had did seem to indicate that adding

385
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:46,633
[SPEAKER_06]: a that adding one or two positions to Kevin's office would be sort of the most conducive to what they're trying to do.

386
00:43:46,653 --> 00:43:46,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I

387
00:43:48,818 --> 00:44:09,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that I can definitely understand where the caution of some of the parents are coming from because, you know, obviously when you've been doing advocacy for as long as y'all have and you've been burned by like, you know, previous counselors and previous city staff and like I could understand the skepticism.

388
00:44:11,467 --> 00:44:17,693
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think that the asks that we have for starting this do need to be clear.

389
00:44:18,594 --> 00:44:29,085
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is also something where I do defer to Councillor Scarpelli's expertise, because I mean, this is something where he is

390
00:44:30,206 --> 00:44:44,092
[SPEAKER_06]: uh a professional in this area like this is what he does for his day job like he does youth programming and he seems to be supportive of the idea of putting another position uh under medford rec to aid this um

391
00:44:45,652 --> 00:44:50,156
[SPEAKER_06]: As Councillor Collins was saying, this doesn't necessarily have to be where something like this ends.

392
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:54,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So it could just be imagined at the beginning.

393
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:02,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we're beginning something, we're not necessarily going to solve every single problem or address every single need at one time.

394
00:45:02,945 --> 00:45:10,811
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think that this is a good place to put it.

395
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:12,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But obviously, I'd like to have more

396
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,231
[SPEAKER_06]: back and forth.

397
00:45:15,854 --> 00:45:18,358
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't I welcome more back and forth on this.

398
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:20,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Council.

399
00:45:20,903 --> 00:45:23,868
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I know everyone needs to talk but I know that we have councils that I

400
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:30,485
[SPEAKER_09]: We only have about 15 minutes left, but I know that we wanted the director also to share some information.

401
00:45:30,505 --> 00:45:32,746
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have, if you have anything time.

402
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:40,788
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to make a point that when, when he was speaking, that he, what he had said was they decided that behind closed doors and we just want to seat at the table.

403
00:45:40,828 --> 00:45:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just reiterating.

404
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:43,288
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

405
00:45:43,788 --> 00:45:45,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Sang, you had your hand up.

406
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I think part of what I'll say will depend on what we hear from the directors.

407
00:45:52,102 --> 00:45:52,662
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hold that.

408
00:45:52,722 --> 00:45:58,145
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in general, I just came in in person, but I was on Zoom the whole time.

409
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:11,010
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like this master plan is really important to making sure that we have a position that doesn't only work in one department, but can work cross departmentally.

410
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:16,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps we look at job descriptions in that as well, making sure that we write

411
00:46:17,478 --> 00:46:22,881
[SPEAKER_01]: into the job description that this person will be collaborating with different departments.

412
00:46:23,422 --> 00:46:31,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's some level of city council involvement too in ensuring some mechanisms that make sure that we can have that.

413
00:46:31,947 --> 00:46:41,653
[SPEAKER_01]: I think another, you know, when we talk about a master plan too, I think it'd be helpful for us as councillors to look into different municipalities that might have programs that

414
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:59,826
[SPEAKER_01]: are more effective, that, you know, maybe they're not 100% what we're aspiring for, but programs that are closer to our end goal and to see how those municipalities got there in the first place, looking at, you know, what types of roles did they hire?

415
00:46:59,926 --> 00:47:00,907
[SPEAKER_01]: How did they structure it?

416
00:47:02,007 --> 00:47:05,370
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we acquire the resources and do that planning that we need to

417
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,811
[SPEAKER_01]: over many years to reach that destination.

418
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:11,852
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't claim to know that much.

419
00:47:14,574 --> 00:47:16,014
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't profess to know the answers.

420
00:47:16,174 --> 00:47:21,196
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really do want to let the director and let the advocates really speak to this.

421
00:47:22,137 --> 00:47:27,699
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so I know we have one more person before Kevin, but you have three minutes to name and address the record.

422
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:39,540
[SPEAKER_12]: First, I just wanted to clarify because what I want, I believe in here, I hear and believe in your vision.

423
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,202
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I'm totally on board.

424
00:47:42,203 --> 00:47:44,586
[SPEAKER_12]: But I hear you want if you can't address.

425
00:47:44,626 --> 00:47:44,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

426
00:47:46,748 --> 00:47:57,894
[SPEAKER_12]: What I hear from the families is that they want it to not be a manager position, but they want this person to be on the ground and helping with inclusion at the Easter egg hunt etc, but also doing like job development.

427
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:03,197
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd like some clarification because it sounds like this magic person who needs background and employment and rack and.

428
00:48:04,017 --> 00:48:05,179
[SPEAKER_12]: ADA and that.

429
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:10,024
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'd love some clarification on that vision because it sounds like there needs to be like seven people.

430
00:48:10,044 --> 00:48:11,305
[SPEAKER_12]: So who's the first person?

431
00:48:11,445 --> 00:48:11,946
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can.

432
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:12,587
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

433
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:15,229
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the skill set for the first person?

434
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:15,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

435
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:18,413
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a clarification from the parents.

436
00:48:21,353 --> 00:48:25,677
[SPEAKER_12]: But, but, but, but you're saying not okay if we can, if we can, you're saying not a manager.

437
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:28,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I'm, I'd like some clarification there.

438
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:36,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to know you kind of brought it up a little bit but how does this body envision the intersection with the Office of diversity because

439
00:48:36,848 --> 00:48:55,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Frances is the ADA coordinator, which is an entire job in itself and she's already doing three full time management jobs and she already has said she doesn't have time to do the enforcement, which could be the part of that job that is making sure that these meetings are more accessible to be working with businesses to make sure that they are actually following the ADA.

440
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,363
[SPEAKER_12]: which is the floor, it's not the thing we aspire to.

441
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:07,794
[SPEAKER_12]: But that also doesn't get an inclusion for people with intellectual disabilities, because the ADA doesn't really touch that at all.

442
00:49:08,475 --> 00:49:10,177
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I also...

443
00:49:15,043 --> 00:49:19,767
[SPEAKER_12]: just that employment is really different than running programs and is an entire skill set in itself.

444
00:49:20,487 --> 00:49:32,556
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I wanted to make sure that this body knows that there's something called the ADA self-assessment and the transition plan, which is kind of like gets at the master plan that you're talking about, but as a legal document that we haven't touched in decades.

445
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:41,902
[SPEAKER_12]: And Francis and I have talked about getting that out again, but that's again, more like compliance stuff, but we could do kind of a, we need to redo our transition plan as a community.

446
00:49:42,723 --> 00:49:51,833
[SPEAKER_12]: Which is the kind of the long term planning that kit was getting at, but also we need to think about like transition plan plus like what does that actually look like in an ideal situation, not just a compliance.

447
00:49:52,393 --> 00:49:52,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

448
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:54,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Kevin, if you can.

449
00:49:54,555 --> 00:50:00,101
[SPEAKER_09]: And before Kevin starts I think that this is this is good what we're doing is good, because I, from what I see.

450
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:02,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saying this is two positions.

451
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:11,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm seeing what we originally thought we're coming in for is really putting together programs for our disabled community through the recreation department.

452
00:50:11,782 --> 00:50:19,885
[SPEAKER_09]: But as Tanya started the program and looking at a totality of what we need, this is something that I, this is great to hear where we are.

453
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:26,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause they really think it's two different, two different positions because they think we need that person, but then we need that person with the boots on the ground.

454
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:29,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're gonna go to Kevin.

455
00:50:31,326 --> 00:50:33,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you mind just hitting the mic for this.

456
00:50:33,387 --> 00:50:34,647
[SPEAKER_07]: It echoes when that one's on.

457
00:50:35,367 --> 00:50:36,068
[SPEAKER_07]: You're good off great.

458
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:37,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just really quickly I wanted to know right.

459
00:50:38,389 --> 00:50:48,713
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like some ideas got thrown around within City Hall and based on the information available at the time, some folks made some suggestions about what might be best.

460
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:51,915
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think decisions were made but I also think it's important.

461
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:57,701
[SPEAKER_07]: that we make it clear that decisions weren't made because of how processes have gone in the past.

462
00:50:57,741 --> 00:50:59,002
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to put that out there.

463
00:51:00,144 --> 00:51:05,069
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate what you're saying about maybe it's looking like a couple positions.

464
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:09,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I really think, to everyone's point here, figuring out

465
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:24,415
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the process for developing exactly what we think is needed as this first initial step and then how that continues to grow and what the accountability system is for that like how are we going to continue to have that conversation, like my mind immediately went to.

466
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:42,708
[SPEAKER_07]: the discussion we've had tonight into job descriptions, and then to Shanine's point, reasonable job descriptions for people to do, and making sure that we do that in a way where we're going through the process so that everyone is included in the creation of those things.

467
00:51:43,488 --> 00:51:46,049
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I defer.

468
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for giving me time.

469
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:52,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Council President, I had that, as one of my closing comments is gonna be that maybe we need to start

470
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:54,130
[SPEAKER_09]: two groups.

471
00:51:54,810 --> 00:52:01,012
[SPEAKER_09]: One is a working group that we talk about the greater position and then the more parent group that's working recreation where we are today.

472
00:52:01,052 --> 00:52:03,213
[SPEAKER_09]: So Kev, I know that you've been waiting.

473
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:04,013
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.

474
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:05,073
[SPEAKER_09]: So go ahead.

475
00:52:05,653 --> 00:52:06,154
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you know what?

476
00:52:06,214 --> 00:52:09,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually, I just want to thank and appreciate the parents being here.

477
00:52:09,915 --> 00:52:15,976
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know we first talked about how we want to first start off, whether I should be talking first or should we listen to the parents first?

478
00:52:16,477 --> 00:52:21,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do appreciate that we had the parents first come up and talk because certainly

479
00:52:22,524 --> 00:52:31,215
[SPEAKER_13]: hearing what the parents are advocating for and what they would like to look for certainly helps out on what this position could potentially look like.

480
00:52:31,996 --> 00:52:39,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say and be honest with you, I'm coming here to talk as a recreation director, so I'm going to be talking more about recreation department and what we can do.

481
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:41,337
[SPEAKER_13]: and what we can help with.

482
00:52:42,217 --> 00:52:47,061
[SPEAKER_13]: We certainly have been doing adaptive and therapeutic programming as best we can.

483
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:51,103
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is limited, I certainly agree.

484
00:52:51,203 --> 00:52:54,025
[SPEAKER_13]: I think all the parents have very valid points.

485
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:58,688
[SPEAKER_13]: We are trying to run adaptive, we're trying to do inclusion services.

486
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:06,534
[SPEAKER_13]: And I certainly will say that there are successful stories to talk about, and there are other areas that we need to improve upon.

487
00:53:07,715 --> 00:53:14,780
[SPEAKER_13]: With that said, probably one of the largest things that I think people have probably heard in multiple discussions.

488
00:53:16,502 --> 00:53:25,649
[SPEAKER_13]: When we try to run our adaptive programs, we are trying to get multitude of volunteers, we get high school students we've worked with Tufts University, particularly with the athletics department to get.

489
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,742
[SPEAKER_13]: different athletes into the program.

490
00:53:29,982 --> 00:53:34,005
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's worked well, but it's a big challenge and it's very daunting.

491
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:40,049
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've really stayed very small to the parent's point that it is usually only once a week.

492
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,372
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is small and it's a lot of work to do.

493
00:53:45,253 --> 00:53:50,957
[SPEAKER_13]: The second part is getting a good number of participants into the program.

494
00:53:51,497 --> 00:53:52,238
[SPEAKER_13]: And it makes sense.

495
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:56,221
[SPEAKER_13]: And Shanine, I'm gonna have to give you credit because I know we've had a lot of discussions with this.

496
00:53:57,141 --> 00:54:10,271
[SPEAKER_13]: is that you have a small number of people that are gonna be able to, one, want to take this program or eligible to take the program, and two, to be available like on a Wednesday night at six o'clock and wanna take a soccer program.

497
00:54:10,932 --> 00:54:12,573
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a very small number.

498
00:54:12,733 --> 00:54:14,155
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's one of the things that we see.

499
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Usually we might get five, six people into a program.

500
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,761
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing I have heard from the parents, and Trish, I gotta give you credit, because I've heard this multiple times

501
00:54:24,272 --> 00:54:33,277
[SPEAKER_13]: different program managers is because we're trying to get a large number of students into that program, we do a very large age range.

502
00:54:33,377 --> 00:54:39,940
[SPEAKER_13]: And most of the time, it's ages 5 to, I want to say 14, correct me if I'm wrong, 18, to 18.

503
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,981
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a very, very large range.

504
00:54:42,661 --> 00:54:47,744
[SPEAKER_13]: But we do that to try to get at least a decent amount of children into the gym and make it full.

505
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:51,159
[SPEAKER_13]: We did listen to the parents and try to split it in half.

506
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,602
[SPEAKER_13]: And when we did split in half, we just didn't get enough numbers in each group.

507
00:54:55,222 --> 00:54:58,265
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually got no one in one age group and two and another so

508
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:00,951
[SPEAKER_13]: not enough people to actually run the program.

509
00:55:01,351 --> 00:55:04,193
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are the different challenges that we have.

510
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:12,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Scarapelli, I know you've talked to us a lot being the assistant director in Somerville and also working with Malden Recreation.

511
00:55:13,461 --> 00:55:16,183
[SPEAKER_13]: We have talked about this, we've talked about these challenges.

512
00:55:16,824 --> 00:55:25,251
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things that I did talk about in our beginning conversations that I've talked about in the past is the way Belmont does their programming.

513
00:55:25,573 --> 00:55:27,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Because Belmont's also a very small department.

514
00:55:28,374 --> 00:55:36,135
[SPEAKER_13]: And years ago, they did work with a, they worked with their neighboring town in Watertown and created the sport program.

515
00:55:37,235 --> 00:55:43,377
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit different, you know, it's mostly on Special Olympics, and they do some social activities.

516
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:46,937
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that's something that we can do as well to try to enhance.

517
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:50,738
[SPEAKER_13]: So really looking at where our challenges are and where we can move forward.

518
00:55:51,537 --> 00:56:03,247
[SPEAKER_13]: what I want to do, or what we're currently working at, is a tri-city group between Medford, Malden, and Somerville, so that we can run these programs as a rotation.

519
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:13,216
[SPEAKER_13]: And George, I know you said, Mr. Scarpelli, in the previous conversation, we did talk about it in a previous city council meeting, that

520
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:20,844
[SPEAKER_13]: It might be difficult to be able to run everything in Metfit, but if we can run it over in Somerville, we can run it in Malden.

521
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:26,166
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very close and nearby, so we can be able to get the numbers and stay local.

522
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:35,530
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mr. Scarpelli, myself, and the Malden Recreation Joe Levine have been having some of these discussions.

523
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:40,432
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually brought this up years ago as well, so it's nice to kind of bring these back up again.

524
00:56:41,112 --> 00:56:42,533
[SPEAKER_13]: And what we want to try to do

525
00:56:44,136 --> 00:56:45,918
[SPEAKER_13]: is first create a parent advisory group.

526
00:56:45,938 --> 00:56:59,290
[SPEAKER_13]: So the idea that we have is having one parent from each city, so Method, Malden, and Somerville have one parent, and have one dedicated employee, whether it's the director, the assistant director, or someone from each city department.

527
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:07,318
[SPEAKER_13]: So it would be a group of six to be able to start these conversations and talk about what type of programs they'd like to see in this tri-city program.

528
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:18,283
[SPEAKER_13]: hearing the last city council meeting and listening to the parents, it sounds like it's also not just doing sports, but having social activity.

529
00:57:19,183 --> 00:57:25,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone have heard me early on when I first started in the recreation department, that's one thing I kept saying is recreation is more than sports.

530
00:57:25,566 --> 00:57:36,550
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's sad to hear that it has a feeling like we just do sports because I'm actually a very big proponent in recreation that we don't do just sports, there's more to that.

531
00:57:37,772 --> 00:57:39,893
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I like to do more social events as well.

532
00:57:40,653 --> 00:57:43,474
[SPEAKER_13]: We are talking right now in Somerville.

533
00:57:43,515 --> 00:57:50,377
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Danny has the handouts if you want to get out and it's a draft of a team night and it would start over in Somerville.

534
00:57:51,438 --> 00:58:00,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Certainly, the other two cities will also send their staff and to help support that but we can do a rotation where in the spring, Somerville will do a social at their facility.

535
00:58:01,522 --> 00:58:02,562
[SPEAKER_13]: In the summer, it would be

536
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:08,953
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the same time, we'll also still continue with some of our sporting program.

537
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:12,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now we've been working with hoops without limits.

538
00:58:12,636 --> 00:58:13,817
[SPEAKER_13]: It's with Tufts University.

539
00:58:14,197 --> 00:58:15,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we have a pretty good partnership with them.

540
00:58:17,563 --> 00:58:26,088
[SPEAKER_13]: We're having difficulty trying to find space for them for the spring, but we are trying to now move that over to Malden so we can host Hoops Without Limit.

541
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,769
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a basketball program in the spring.

542
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:33,933
[SPEAKER_13]: In the summer, one of our more successful adaptive programs that we've had is swim lessons.

543
00:58:35,154 --> 00:58:38,116
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are going to try to continue that adaptive swim lesson at Tufts Pool.

544
00:58:38,616 --> 00:58:41,098
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in the fall, some of them will be doing one.

545
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:44,460
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll again, try this rotational thing where

546
00:58:45,342 --> 00:58:54,837
[SPEAKER_13]: There'll be one town doing a sport activity, one town doing a social aspect, and we'll try to cross market with each other and try to get that participation number up there.

547
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,954
[SPEAKER_13]: The other part that I do want to add is field trips.

548
00:59:00,815 --> 00:59:06,580
[SPEAKER_13]: We are very lucky as the city council knows from previous end of the season reports.

549
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Last year, we did accept a recreation bus.

550
00:59:10,803 --> 00:59:12,405
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've started to do field trips.

551
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:18,430
[SPEAKER_13]: So when we talk about social activities, that might also be another thing that we can work with of actually

552
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:21,900
[SPEAKER_13]: going places or going to restaurants and things like that.

553
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,563
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd love to listen more to the parents about what activities that might be included and that we can help out with.

554
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:35,387
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is our plan moving forward of doing this Tri-City thing.

555
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:44,852
[SPEAKER_13]: The biggest thing that I have some concern with is having the appropriate staff to be able to implement a lot of this stuff.

556
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:47,660
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a couple of things with this.

557
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:53,384
[SPEAKER_13]: The first thing I do want to mention, and Shanine, I have to thank Shanine right from the beginning when we first started out.

558
00:59:53,444 --> 00:59:57,046
[SPEAKER_13]: Shanine and I go back over 20 years, more than 20.

559
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:06,773
[SPEAKER_13]: People know that I, you know, most people know that I'm very big into aquatics and I work a lot at the state level with aquatic management.

560
01:00:07,153 --> 01:00:10,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Shanine does that as adaptive program and therapeutic recreation.

561
01:00:10,575 --> 01:00:14,378
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we started our friendship and our partnership over 20 years ago

562
01:00:15,369 --> 01:00:17,450
[SPEAKER_13]: working together on adaptive swim lessons.

563
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:29,013
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that said, one of the things that we first, when we were able to add another full-time position at that time, we're still very small, we're looking for a program manager.

564
01:00:29,533 --> 01:00:34,934
[SPEAKER_13]: In that job description as a program manager, part of their job is to run adaptive programming.

565
01:00:36,155 --> 01:00:41,216
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the preferred qualifications is to have their certified therapeutic recreation specialist.

566
01:00:41,986 --> 01:00:44,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I will say, that can be a challenge.

567
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:48,072
[SPEAKER_13]: We've done job postings for this position.

568
01:00:48,452 --> 01:00:49,974
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had a previous program manager.

569
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:51,715
[SPEAKER_13]: We just hired recently a new one.

570
01:00:52,796 --> 01:00:56,740
[SPEAKER_13]: And we don't get a lot of people with their CTRS certification.

571
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:04,888
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a small niche, and it does, there's not a lot of applicants out there, especially for the pay that we're looking for.

572
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:11,068
[SPEAKER_13]: With that said, we have been able to hire Krista DeVoe.

573
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:14,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say Krista DeVoe is out on maternity leave.

574
01:01:14,951 --> 01:01:18,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations Krista if you're actually tuning in and watching this.

575
01:01:19,434 --> 01:01:23,596
[SPEAKER_13]: So I will say, you know, we do have someone who is out right now.

576
01:01:25,088 --> 01:01:27,929
[SPEAKER_13]: they do have their master's degree in therapeutic recreation.

577
01:01:27,949 --> 01:01:29,610
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have talked to her.

578
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:40,714
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the reasons why we particularly chose this applicant was not only having their therapeutic degree, but also seeing the type of programs that they've done in Springfield.

579
01:01:40,894 --> 01:01:47,256
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can show this with the parents if you like afterwards, just a little bit of what she's done in Springfield, but

580
01:01:47,656 --> 01:01:49,257
[SPEAKER_13]: She's done therapeutic recreation.

581
01:01:49,297 --> 01:01:52,339
[SPEAKER_13]: She had her own club program and it was social aspects.

582
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:59,263
[SPEAKER_13]: It was taking, uh, not only children, but adults to go bowling, to go to Patriot's place and do certain activities.

583
01:01:59,644 --> 01:02:01,705
[SPEAKER_13]: There were different dances and things like that.

584
01:02:01,825 --> 01:02:16,014
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, I think we already have someone on our staff that has the capability of implementing some, not all, but some of the things that, um, I've heard in the previous city council meeting and tonight, um,

585
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:21,165
[SPEAKER_13]: But I need to make very clear that we did hire a program manager.

586
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:27,573
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a very small portion of time, up to 25% of their time can be devoted to this.

587
01:02:28,634 --> 01:02:36,303
[SPEAKER_13]: So, certainly getting some help and one of the things I want to make sure the counselors are aware that as our department grows, we are

588
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:45,545
[SPEAKER_13]: being asked to run multiple facilities between Hormel Stadium, the hockey rink, the Method Recreation Center, Tufts Pool, Wrights Pond.

589
01:02:46,045 --> 01:02:47,907
[SPEAKER_13]: We do a lot of the planning.

590
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:51,550
[SPEAKER_13]: We do different projects throughout all the different parks.

591
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:54,033
[SPEAKER_13]: We do all the scheduling for all the parks.

592
01:02:54,685 --> 01:02:58,688
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been more and more added to our list than just programs.

593
01:02:59,429 --> 01:03:05,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Just earlier today talking to someone, they thought that the bulk of my job was program management.

594
01:03:05,614 --> 01:03:15,922
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reality is I have to give that to our program manager because a lot of my position at this point has turned into facility management and scheduling of the parks and stuff.

595
01:03:16,503 --> 01:03:30,536
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we are looking at some help with the recreation department, I would propose a assistant to the program manager so the program manager can have more time, more dedicated to implement some of the things that they have done in Springfield.

596
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:32,758
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be my hope.

597
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:35,912
[SPEAKER_13]: I have mentioned to we don't have an office manager.

598
01:03:35,952 --> 01:03:37,972
[SPEAKER_13]: So someone calls or someone emails.

599
01:03:38,452 --> 01:03:46,935
[SPEAKER_13]: It's between Krista, our assistant director, Danny and I who are answering the phone, responding to emails and doing the day to day paying the bills and things like that.

600
01:03:47,015 --> 01:03:52,157
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think where the comment was made, you know, we need some more boots on the ground.

601
01:03:52,237 --> 01:03:53,257
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't need another manager.

602
01:03:53,857 --> 01:03:58,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Um II actually agree with that on the on the recreation department side is we don't need another manager.

603
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,883
[SPEAKER_13]: We need more people helping us out doing some of the tasks so that we can put more attention and focus.

604
01:04:03,903 --> 01:04:19,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and to to share with that, Kevin, I think that as a professional, when we started this process years ago to make method a full-time program, I think we dropped the ball like we've done with a lot of things in the last five and a half years but II

605
01:04:20,197 --> 01:04:26,319
[SPEAKER_09]: to give people an understanding what neighboring recreation departments have, I'll use ours.

606
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:27,980
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a director.

607
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,581
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the program developer.

608
01:04:31,561 --> 01:04:34,822
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a recreation manager.

609
01:04:35,763 --> 01:04:38,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we have eight program coordinators.

610
01:04:39,124 --> 01:04:40,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a marketing specialist.

611
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:42,505
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a financial director.

612
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:44,326
[SPEAKER_09]: We have administrative assistant.

613
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:46,367
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a facilities director.

614
01:04:47,123 --> 01:04:52,331
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also have a pool, an aquatics director and an assistant aquatics director.

615
01:04:53,428 --> 01:04:59,270
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're bringing in now, what we're looking now is to bring in a recreation therapeutic specialist.

616
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and that's the person that started helping us start this program.

617
01:05:02,611 --> 01:05:06,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can see the limitations and I think this is two separate issues.

618
01:05:07,073 --> 01:05:14,235
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what we have right now, really as what we discussed earlier, two very different and specific wants and needs.

619
01:05:14,855 --> 01:05:22,318
[SPEAKER_09]: One is really having that inclusion specialist that is overlooking the whole city where it's just not recreation, but everything.

620
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:28,503
[SPEAKER_09]: right, getting our families and our 0-99 involved in our community.

621
01:05:28,864 --> 01:05:44,618
[SPEAKER_09]: And then having that recreation person that's looking at recreation programming, partnering with the parents, not coming from what Kevin's going to say, or from what I'm going to say, or what Joe Levine will say in Malden, but really work with parents to say, these are the programs

622
01:05:45,098 --> 01:05:48,903
[SPEAKER_09]: that would could run out of recreation, that would be successful.

623
01:05:48,943 --> 01:05:57,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what you have in front of you is one of the programs that talking to parents and getting an idea as just a rough draft that we can kick to get it started.

624
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:02,040
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, yeah.

625
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you turn the mic on?

626
01:06:20,429 --> 01:06:28,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want people to see that this was three conversations, three phone conversations yourself.

627
01:06:29,178 --> 01:06:29,939
[SPEAKER_03]: You took the lead.

628
01:06:29,979 --> 01:06:31,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You grabbed two more people.

629
01:06:31,601 --> 01:06:32,361
[SPEAKER_03]: You got this done.

630
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:35,304
[SPEAKER_03]: This didn't cost any additional money through overrides.

631
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:37,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that came from- It can be done.

632
01:06:37,847 --> 01:06:38,588
[SPEAKER_03]: It was done in a month.

633
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:40,089
[SPEAKER_09]: And miss Sherry, this came from you.

634
01:06:40,209 --> 01:06:41,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So this came from the parents.

635
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:44,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's why when Kevin said we're going to start fresh is really do that.

636
01:06:44,853 --> 01:06:50,657
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think from this point going forward, the meetings, they're great writing down descriptions.

637
01:06:50,717 --> 01:06:51,198
[SPEAKER_03]: They're great.

638
01:06:51,418 --> 01:06:53,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you want a clear idea, but let's see action.

639
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:54,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

640
01:06:55,741 --> 01:06:56,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that, um,

641
01:06:57,411 --> 01:06:58,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I, we are coming close.

642
01:06:58,993 --> 01:07:02,435
[SPEAKER_09]: We do have, it looks like one person from the community who has a question.

643
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:14,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if I can just tie some things in and if any other councils want to just add that in, just really tie this day up and get some action step for the, as we move, move to tomorrow.

644
01:07:14,485 --> 01:07:15,106
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can.

645
01:07:15,947 --> 01:07:16,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Gaston, if we can.

646
01:07:17,308 --> 01:07:18,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, Chair Scarpelli.

647
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:20,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaston Fiore, 61 Stigney Road.

648
01:07:21,711 --> 01:07:23,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add,

649
01:07:24,097 --> 01:07:40,421
[SPEAKER_00]: that what I got out of this meeting, among a lot of things, is that I think it's key that the inclusion specialist and whoever else gets hired is as close as possible to the families of persons with disabilities.

650
01:07:40,521 --> 01:07:46,003
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's essential that that happens, so then the right programs can be developed.

651
01:07:46,503 --> 01:07:53,565
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just searching to see what's available already from the City of Medford, and I found the Commission for Persons with Disabilities,

652
01:07:54,232 --> 01:08:07,078
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just wondering what role this commission was playing, because for example, I'm at their webpage right now, and then it seems that the commission has eight members, but then five of them are vacant right now.

653
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:23,446
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think potentially this could be a great avenue that could serve sort of as, you know, for the families to sort of get involved and then work together with the inclusion specialists and whoever else gets hired

654
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:39,869
[SPEAKER_00]: for these projects to make sure that the programmes that get developed again are 100 per cent in agreement to what the people with disabilities and their families need.

655
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:50,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if someone could take a look at the Commission for Persons with Disabilities, I would like to know why there are so many vacant places, I think that would be useful.

656
01:08:51,027 --> 01:08:52,428
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was extremely informative.

657
01:08:52,448 --> 01:08:55,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everyone that has participated and for having organized it.

658
01:08:55,871 --> 01:08:56,611
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.

659
01:08:57,492 --> 01:08:58,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Gaston.

660
01:08:59,113 --> 01:08:59,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Council Bias.

661
01:08:59,834 --> 01:09:01,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Chair Scarpelli.

662
01:09:01,996 --> 01:09:03,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to everyone who's spoken tonight.

663
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:07,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, you know, we're talking about a lot of different things.

664
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:20,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think your point's incredibly well taken that a piece of the big piece of this is what's the accountability and the mobilization and activating existing resources and using them in a better way.

665
01:09:21,627 --> 01:09:33,897
[SPEAKER_07]: to the point, you know, once we've done as much of that as we can, or not necessarily in sequence, but in parallel, getting new resources to the table, and then making sure that everything's working in partnership.

666
01:09:34,098 --> 01:09:40,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, and I appreciate this programming that we're working on.

667
01:09:40,423 --> 01:09:45,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually really appreciate the regional approach, because I think it brings more resources to the table.

668
01:09:47,545 --> 01:09:51,411
[SPEAKER_07]: There's obviously upsides and downsides to that too that we could talk about for a long time.

669
01:09:53,114 --> 01:09:57,340
[SPEAKER_07]: But in general, how we move from here.

670
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:01,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Personally, I would make a motion that we keep this paper in committee.

671
01:10:02,243 --> 01:10:07,865
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually have an initial budget meeting committee of the whole next week and several more over the next couple of months.

672
01:10:08,045 --> 01:10:12,847
[SPEAKER_07]: And we keep this in committee so that we can bring it up during those budget meetings.

673
01:10:13,387 --> 01:10:20,169
[SPEAKER_07]: We could, you know, as folks who are working on this say, okay, folks are available this meeting, we can get it on the agenda, keep it on the agenda for that.

674
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:27,352
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would make that motion, but I also wanna leave the floor open to whatever other next steps folks think we need to move on.

675
01:10:28,112 --> 01:10:28,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

676
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:50,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do think that that's, that's a great motion, but if we can, if someone can make a motion that, that through this, through this subcommittee meeting that we have, we call on Kevin Bailey is the recreation director to work with our parents to start a parent working group for recreation programming.

677
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:54,997
[SPEAKER_09]: So we get that piece tied in so we can continue with that growth if we can.

678
01:10:56,537 --> 01:11:00,179
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we could, that piece, we can get that running right now.

679
01:11:01,339 --> 01:11:03,440
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can do that.

680
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:03,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

681
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:05,560
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the amendment?

682
01:11:06,361 --> 01:11:12,683
[SPEAKER_07]: The amendment is the recreation department establish a parent working group and for recreation programming.

683
01:11:12,863 --> 01:11:20,085
[SPEAKER_09]: With a parent organization to continue with programs for families with disabilities.

684
01:11:20,425 --> 01:11:20,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

685
01:11:21,126 --> 01:11:21,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

686
01:11:22,046 --> 01:11:24,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then I think there's this other piece.

687
01:11:24,547 --> 01:11:25,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how to word it.

688
01:11:25,896 --> 01:11:35,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think that if we, from what I've heard, right, I think that if we look at Councilor Callahan had a great point and volunteers are great, but in my experience,

689
01:11:36,638 --> 01:11:45,485
[SPEAKER_09]: volunteers aren't sustainable, but bringing that volunteer in as part of a working group with that volunteer, we have some great people in the audience.

690
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:54,113
[SPEAKER_09]: I won't call her name out because I know she's probably the smartest recreation mind dealing with this community.

691
01:11:54,253 --> 01:11:56,715
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's so important that we involve that person.

692
01:11:58,056 --> 01:11:58,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Kevin's good friend.

693
01:12:00,138 --> 01:12:16,212
[SPEAKER_09]: But we look at starting a working group with someone from the diversity team, the school department, the recreation department, our parent volunteers, our community volunteers, a city council member in community affairs and someone from the mayor's office.

694
01:12:16,252 --> 01:12:27,521
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that as we start the budget process, I think that's the team we need to bring together to express what you said, Tanya, when we first started is something bigger than I thought when you first came up.

695
01:12:28,637 --> 01:12:34,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Boy, that was a kick in the pants to say, okay, this is something bigger than just recreation programs and not making it to sports.

696
01:12:35,078 --> 01:12:54,002
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that our community needs for growth and development, not just through their birth, but as we know, my little friend who's now 21 is now moving on and is gonna need that support as well to grow and get involved.

697
01:12:54,062 --> 01:12:56,323
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's important.

698
01:12:56,343 --> 01:12:57,003
[SPEAKER_09]: So Kevin, sorry.

699
01:12:58,587 --> 01:12:58,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

700
01:12:59,147 --> 01:13:18,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Just one thing I just want to reiterate, just talking, our program manager who does the therapeutic recreation stuff, the people that, the person that we hired specifically to help with some of these programs and the development of them, she is just starting her maternity leave.

701
01:13:18,453 --> 01:13:19,873
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are down three people.

702
01:13:20,273 --> 01:13:22,674
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be down for three months, this position.

703
01:13:23,214 --> 01:13:25,815
[SPEAKER_13]: It is now Danny and I who are running the programs.

704
01:13:27,005 --> 01:13:29,728
[SPEAKER_13]: And we need to get ready for the pond and the pool, as you know.

705
01:13:29,788 --> 01:13:33,110
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't want to put lots of work stacked on me.

706
01:13:33,431 --> 01:13:44,640
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I would ask, and this is something that I can look a little more into, is we do have other people in the community that could help us out with this.

707
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:54,348
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will be asking the administration or asking for some help and seeing if I can bring someone in temporary so that we're not waiting three months until

708
01:13:54,935 --> 01:14:01,481
[SPEAKER_13]: our program as she comes out of maternity leave and to be honest with you when she comes back, we're in camp mode.

709
01:14:01,501 --> 01:14:06,486
[SPEAKER_13]: We got a couple of weeks of that camp start so I think already there's going to be a lot of work when she gets back.

710
01:14:06,926 --> 01:14:10,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to be able to get moving on this relatively quickly, but I also

711
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:15,164
[SPEAKER_13]: realize that I need help to be able to do this.

712
01:14:15,504 --> 01:14:26,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It could be a volunteer recreation assistant director in a neighboring community that lives in Medford that might volunteer his time to help with that process as well.

713
01:14:26,851 --> 01:14:33,876
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think maybe we have a sidebar at the end of the meeting and we just talk and get put something concrete together because I know you up there Kevin.

714
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:49,113
[SPEAKER_09]: What people don't understand, when your director, when your team has to spend 10 to 15 hours a week returning emails, returning phone calls, doing menial, you know, positions that really weren't meant for them.

715
01:14:49,173 --> 01:14:53,174
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know that, you know, Kevin's dealing with getting the pond and pool.

716
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:59,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, I have two people that are doing one pool right now and, you know,

717
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Granted, it's beneficial.

718
01:15:01,598 --> 01:15:02,798
[SPEAKER_13]: And I balance and get it ready.

719
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:04,379
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just managing it.

720
01:15:04,439 --> 01:15:04,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

721
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,020
[SPEAKER_09]: It's facilitating, right.

722
01:15:06,141 --> 01:15:09,723
[SPEAKER_09]: It's getting it, painting, whatever needs to be done, right?

723
01:15:10,163 --> 01:15:11,684
[SPEAKER_09]: All the safety protocols in place.

724
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:13,285
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we understand that.

725
01:15:13,325 --> 01:15:20,069
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope everybody understands that there has been so many limitations because it hasn't been funded correctly and staffed correctly.

726
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,891
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I've talked to parents to nauseam about that.

727
01:15:22,931 --> 01:15:26,153
[SPEAKER_09]: But as we're moving forward, I think that we have a path for programming.

728
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:35,758
[SPEAKER_09]: because of the Tri-City partnership that you can use different resources to really bring some great programming for our families.

729
01:15:35,818 --> 01:15:38,639
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that piece, I think that that's what we can talk about.

730
01:15:40,758 --> 01:15:57,862
[SPEAKER_09]: that's something we'll talk about the site because I know we're running out of time but I know that as we move forward that bigger picture like council bear said I think that's something that as we get into the budget season we really start talking as a greater picture to craft that that job description of really what we want that person to do that's going to

731
01:15:58,462 --> 01:16:10,878
[SPEAKER_07]: be that point person for every other department in the city that's working with recreation so yeah and i just want to make the point that that i think we should empower council i mean councillor callahan absolutely with that the parents have been working on it and the staff have been

732
01:16:11,788 --> 01:16:20,535
[SPEAKER_07]: working on it so far to keep can be to I think you know, however, however, you want to phrase it to convene that in a concrete way.

733
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:23,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't I don't want to call them out there, but you've done such great work.

734
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:26,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, school committee member all apply school committee member.

735
01:16:26,901 --> 01:16:30,464
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll get and then we have, you know, Council Kelly and Council lemon.

736
01:16:30,484 --> 01:16:33,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already been working with the parents with that bigger picture.

737
01:16:33,746 --> 01:16:38,871
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I think that'd be great that maybe if they could take that leadership and

738
01:16:39,811 --> 01:16:43,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Then work with that working group with that volunteer and getting everybody together.

739
01:16:44,034 --> 01:16:47,957
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that bringing it all together, especially a budget time when we all bring this to the table.

740
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:53,881
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all going to have some pretty interesting requests and ask and I'm not going to say no to you.

741
01:16:55,882 --> 01:16:56,442
[SPEAKER_09]: You're scamming.

742
01:16:57,743 --> 01:17:03,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, so does anybody else have any questions or

743
01:17:05,055 --> 01:17:06,715
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a motion on the tables.

[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't need a roll call.

[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions before we wrap up?

755

[SPEAKER_09]: I know that we do have a meeting that started 20 minutes ago, but- 12, 12.

756
01:17:28,625 --> 01:17:33,648
[SPEAKER_09]: 12 minutes ago, but I'll make sure that this happens in a separate evening where we have more time dedicated to this.

757
01:17:33,688 --> 01:17:35,710
[SPEAKER_09]: So again, thank you everybody for coming.

758
