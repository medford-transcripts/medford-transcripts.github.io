1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:00,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:07,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the April 4th, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

3
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:16,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first item on the agenda is to look at the minutes from our March 7th meeting.

4
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:18,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone have a chance to look at them over?

5
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:20,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

6
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:22,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

7
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:24,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything looks good.

8
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:25,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Move approval.

9
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:27,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second that.

10
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:28,285
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

11
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:30,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

12
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:30,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

13
00:00:31,187 --> 00:00:32,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

14
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:33,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So the minutes are accepted.

15
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:40,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just take care of Gene here before we get going.

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So our first item on the agenda is, well, after the minutes, is Articles 2 and 3.

18
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:56,332
[SPEAKER_02]: So did everyone have a chance to look over the draft?

19
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there were some questions on the draft.

20
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:07,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we just want to dive into our questions and comments on that section?

21
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:11,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know the first ones I noticed were about eligibility.

22
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you put it up on the screen so that we can?

23
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:16,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

24
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:16,979
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do that.

25
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:23,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Go through it because I know I'm the author of an awful lot of the comments, so my apologies.

26
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are, and I will make them bigger.

27
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:35,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

28
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:37,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that big enough?

29
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Should I make it a little bigger?

30
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:38,886
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bigger.

31
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:39,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

32
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:45,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So your first question was here under eligibility, right?

33
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

34
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Your first comments, whatever.

35
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:49,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

36
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:53,915
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and I had a lot of thoughts.

37
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:57,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a show more on there too.

38
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:59,558
[SPEAKER_08]: So here.

39
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move my rail over.

40
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, do you want to just open up?

41
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:10,435
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk about what you.

42
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:12,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

43
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:18,659
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, obviously, being a Medford resident and voter goes without saying.

44
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:23,822
[SPEAKER_08]: And we talked about this a little bit the last time.

45
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:28,585
[SPEAKER_08]: It's reflected in the minutes about felony convictions.

46
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:34,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And I put in there having a clean quarry.

47
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:56,877
[SPEAKER_08]: with no felonies at any time, or if we, for some reason, can't do that, then if somebody's been convicted of a felony at any point in their lifetime, that if they're going to run, then they need to be completely transparent about it on all of their campaign materials.

48
00:02:58,298 --> 00:02:59,459
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did notice,

49
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:06,581
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some of the backup in front of me.

50
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Bear with me here.

51
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:15,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Everett had something in their charter.

52
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:24,812
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes under the school committee prohibitions, but it can certainly apply to anybody and I would like it.

53
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:37,189
[SPEAKER_08]: When we talk about the school committee subcommittee, I'll bring it up there too, but they have in their charter a felony conviction.

54
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:50,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Any person who has been finally convicted of a state or federal felony shall not be eligible to petition for or serve in any elective or appointive office or position under the city.

55
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it goes on to say,

56
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:06,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Any school committee who has been finally convicted of a state or felony shall be deemed to have vacated said office and shall be disqualified from serving in any other elective or appointed office under the city.

57
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:12,588
[SPEAKER_08]: And this appeared to be an amendment to their charter in October of 2021.

58
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:22,653
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I found interesting was that it didn't, you know, the first part of it didn't specify, you know,

59
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,318
[SPEAKER_08]: that the felony had to be...

60
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:36,503
[SPEAKER_08]: If it happened while in office or something like that, any person who has been finally convicted of a state or felony or federal felony shall not be eligible to serve.

61
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:44,506
[SPEAKER_08]: So it didn't matter when the felony occurred, you're not eligible to serve according to their charter.

62
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I said, this is under the school committee prohibitions.

63
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:54,910
[SPEAKER_08]: But it certainly could be applicable for, I would make it applicable for any branch.

64
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,271
[SPEAKER_08]: or all three of our branches, quite frankly.

65
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,313
[SPEAKER_08]: When we jump over to the executive branch, I wrote the same thing.

66
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:06,975
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be one of my feelings.

67
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:12,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also of the mind and I know it's a pretty unpopular opinion.

68
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we focus on that one and then move on?

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,620
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

70
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably.

71
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:22,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just so we can get through them.

72
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Take them one at a time.

73
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:33,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, does anybody have comments about the... Okay, Jean.

74
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:43,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'd like to hear from the Collins Center how other cities other than Everett deal with this issue.

75
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:47,385
[SPEAKER_07]: But in general, I'm not in favor of that.

76
00:05:48,428 --> 00:06:01,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that people who've been through the criminal justice system can be good, if they've served their time, can be good city councilors, mayor.

77
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:18,792
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, if they had a drug addiction issue, overcame that, they may be able to relate to issues in the community better than someone who has not gone through that type of an issue.

78
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:39,439
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we know, or at least I know, and I can present data if people need it, that people of color are in the criminal justice system more than white people for very similar crimes in Massachusetts and nationally.

79
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:47,501
[SPEAKER_07]: So to me, it has a disproportionate impact on people of color and has been used in other places to keep people of color

80
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:51,043
[SPEAKER_07]: out of elected office.

81
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:56,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are my two concerns about that, but I'd love to hear from the Collins Center, you know, what other cities have done.

82
00:06:56,765 --> 00:07:01,888
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also like to, I'm sorry.

83
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:10,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let Anthony Wilson answer, and then Anthony, we'll hear your question, okay?

84
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony and Andrea, so Anthony Wilson, go ahead.

85
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,053
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if Marilyn can,

86
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:26,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, she's still on mute, but I'll just say, so there are provisions in charters around the state regarding felony convictions.

87
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:39,983
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of the language about felony conviction, if I understand correctly, this is a conversation about whether or not a person can be eligible for office, which I think you mentioned, Everett.

88
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:43,224
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority, sort of the vast majority of

89
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:59,354
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that felony convictions are discussed in charters across Massachusetts is in the context of a person being holding office and being, for lack of a better term, ejected from office because of a felony conviction during their tenure.

90
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:04,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Marilyn, I don't know if you have anything to add.

91
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:08,340
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's the most common provision.

92
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,542
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to relate to your serving

93
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:16,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it doesn't relate to your serving in office, but it has to occur while you're serving in office.

94
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

95
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony Andrea, you had a question or a comment.

96
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:23,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a comment.

97
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,207
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a comment on, you know,

98
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:48,459
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole issue of somebody who may have had a felony conviction in their past serving or being viewed by the city of Medford as being a citizen in full standing with all the rights and responsibilities and entitlements of the community.

99
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:55,060
[SPEAKER_05]: If we kind of take it upon ourselves to kind of eliminate

100
00:08:56,066 --> 00:09:05,329
[SPEAKER_05]: the opportunity of them ever being involved in government, we would be doing like a disservice to not only them, but to our whole community.

101
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:10,350
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I believe in rehabilitation and second chances.

102
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe in more than second.

103
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:16,092
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe in, and you know, everybody should always have a chance.

104
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:22,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they can prove to the community that they can serve and they can be elected,

105
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:44,126
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, with having a felony in their past or having any kind of transgression, if they can overcome that and have something to give our community, we would be foolish and wrong to deny them.

106
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,407
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's not only morally wrong, I think

107
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,076
[SPEAKER_05]: those types of provisions.

108
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:56,661
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know why the one was put in in Everett.

109
00:09:57,201 --> 00:10:04,692
[SPEAKER_05]: That was due to multiple infractions while in office by people elected and

110
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:12,918
[SPEAKER_05]: in school positions where they wanted to kind of send a message to the community.

111
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:25,484
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe we need to do that in Medford and I think it would be wise for us to stay very clear of any type of language that kind of portrays us in that light.

112
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:27,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

113
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:28,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.

114
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:35,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree with what Jean and Anthony have said.

115
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:43,763
[SPEAKER_06]: The only, you know, rehabilitation is, that's what the community is about.

116
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:51,366
[SPEAKER_06]: However, a conviction, a felony conviction during their term is a black eye on the city.

117
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would think we have to look at that a little bit harder.

118
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,609
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone is convicted of a felony,

119
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:09,933
[SPEAKER_06]: that the process of serving time and their sentence and all that stuff would hang over the city in every level, mayor, city council, and school committee.

120
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:22,859
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to look at the difference between having a history that you served your time and an active felony conviction during your time in office.

121
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:24,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

122
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

123
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:25,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Dean.

124
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:29,920
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to agree with Ron.

125
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:43,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's in article or section 10, because we've talked about it before, that if you have a conviction, felony conviction while in office, then that's different.

126
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:45,792
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that's covered in a different section.

127
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:46,673
[SPEAKER_07]: I would support that.

128
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,735
[SPEAKER_02]: A different section of the charter.

129
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:49,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

130
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:51,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like the last section.

131
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:53,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I add to that?

132
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:54,620
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

133
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:58,972
[SPEAKER_05]: In that regard, I agree with everyone.

134
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:02,033
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think it should be even a felony conviction.

135
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:15,639
[SPEAKER_05]: In some communities where, say, a mayor is accused of a crime and it hasn't been fully litigated and there hasn't been kind of a

136
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,621
[SPEAKER_05]: a resolution.

137
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:30,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that, you know, we as a community should have a mechanism to remove them from office, you know, and not to wait, even wait for a felony conviction.

138
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:37,239
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I know that happened in, and I believe somewhere on the South Shore where the mayor was convicted, was

139
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:52,449
[SPEAKER_05]: was charged with kind of getting, receiving like kickbacks from a marijuana kind of company and they were under indictment and the town was able to kind of get them out of office.

140
00:12:52,749 --> 00:13:00,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like right after an election or they would have to wait, you know, sometimes people don't come to trial for, you know, four or five

141
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,311
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 years, you know what I mean?

142
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:04,451
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

143
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:07,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we are looking at recall provisions, which I think would.

144
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:08,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Exactly.

145
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:10,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Address what you're talking about.

146
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:27,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I want to hear from Maury, but first I just wanted to quickly ask Anthony or Marilyn, what section of the charter, the provision for an elected official to be vacated if they are convicted of a felony while in office, where does that go in the charter?

147
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually in the general provision section.

148
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

149
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Maury.

150
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:39,863
[SPEAKER_02]: He's muted.

151
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Maury.

152
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:41,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

153
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:41,864
[SPEAKER_02]: You're muted.

154
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.

155
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:43,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

156
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:47,523
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with what everyone is saying here.

157
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:53,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand where Eunice is coming from with her proposal, with her critique of it.

158
00:13:54,488 --> 00:14:03,935
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one that believes everyone should have an opportunity to right a wrong, and if they've done whatever they can done, made up

159
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:11,225
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever they had to, whether it be time served or whatever the case is, everyone has a right to do it.

160
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:17,628
[SPEAKER_01]: My point was that if you're indicted during your tenure,

161
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:33,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard what Anthony just said, but if we take that role, we're saying you're guilty without, you know, before you've had your time to claim your innocence through a court of law.

162
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:40,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it's kind of like, it's a touchy feely type situation that I think it just has to play itself out.

163
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:47,567
[SPEAKER_01]: And if someone really is in trouble, they'll generally just, you know, resign from that position, hopefully.

164
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:57,436
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you were just saying, we need a vehicle for recall, and that would handle that.

165
00:14:58,517 --> 00:14:59,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Maury.

166
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't see any more hands right now.

167
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,745
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we want to

168
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,943
[SPEAKER_02]: wrap this part of this because we have a lot to move on to.

169
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:15,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any other comment?

170
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:20,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to try to make any motions on any of these points?

171
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:28,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to add the convicted felony during term somewhere?

172
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you want to move it?

173
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we could vote to put that in the charter and then just add it to the appropriate section later.

174
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:42,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's something that people want to look at tonight, we could.

175
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:48,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think that's in like section what, nine or 10?

176
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:49,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

177
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting a bit of it today.

178
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:58,924
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that there's a, I know there's a provision for, you know, while in office.

179
00:15:59,305 --> 00:15:59,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

180
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:02,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying you want to wait until we look at that section.

181
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:04,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

182
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that makes sense.

183
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

184
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,950
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I,

185
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:16,758
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I put, because I still believe in it, but, you know, I know that the other piece of being convicted.

186
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:24,990
[SPEAKER_08]: While in office lands elsewhere in the charter, so I think it makes sense to.

187
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:31,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, to me, it was, you know, sort of 1 in the same sort of 2 different things.

188
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:44,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, if we're going the direction, if it's the will of the group to go in the direction of convicted while in office, then that clearly goes elsewhere in the in the charter.

189
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:46,866
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so be wrong.

190
00:16:48,473 --> 00:17:02,568
[SPEAKER_06]: So just back to this point, I wasn't involved in the deliberations here, but I thought we talked about when you moved out of your ward, you were resigning from your ward councilor position.

191
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was discussed in the subcommittee.

192
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:23,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the decision was that it made sense for the person to, if they moved out of their ward and still resided in Medford, that they could finish out their term, which currently is a two-year term.

193
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be less than two years unless they moved the day after they were elected.

194
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,524
[SPEAKER_08]: or the day after they were sworn in.

195
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:33,165
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry?

196
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:50,777
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's a two-year term and somebody moves three months or even six months into their term, and now you're looking at 18 or 20 months while they're in a different ward than the one that they were elected from.

197
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:56,301
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's something that people want to

198
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:09,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we ask the call-in center because I thought it was common protocol that that's what happened when you left your ward, you resigned your position, but maybe the call-in center knows better.

199
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:10,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

200
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:16,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony or Marilyn, do you have any comments on that?

201
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go first if Maryland does.

202
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:41,539
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if there's a pattern or perhaps a trend, but there are, I would say, there are a variety of communities that do it the way that is articulated here, whereas if you have a ward system and you're still in the city and you move out of the ward, that you continue to be a counselor for that term.

203
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:46,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a group in that category.

204
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:56,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen an equal set of communities where if you leave the ward, you've effectively resigned from office.

205
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:06,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, and I'd love to get Marilyn's office, but I think it can be tricky in terms of one thing that happens,

206
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:15,844
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ground is it can be tricky in terms of, and it comes up usually in the context of eligibility, of proving where someone's residence is.

207
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:33,249
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get into a situation in which, you know, someone is claiming that someone has left the ward and wants the person to, you know, resign from office, then it's a tricky question of establishing, you know, where their domicile is.

208
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:37,310
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a tricky place to be.

209
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:41,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

210
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:44,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Marilyn, did you want to add to that?

211
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:54,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say that there is a slight trend to allow the counselor who was elected to complete the term to which elected.

212
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,281
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what charters in recent years have provided.

213
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:14,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with Anthony that that domicile is an issue, but sometimes you have to take into consideration why the person is moving.

214
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:23,564
[SPEAKER_09]: Often it's to care for an elderly relative, for example.

215
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

216
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:27,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

217
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:28,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury.

218
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:59,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe something like if we add a clause in there, but as long as they're living, continue to maintain living status within the city, that if they want to continue as a ward alderman for what they were elected to, they must maintain a district office, let's say, in that ward where they're obligated to hold monthly office hours and so forth so the people that elected them still have access to them.

219
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:05,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

220
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:09,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony or Marilyn, have you ever seen anything like that in a charter?

221
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:11,132
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

222
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:13,575
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it.

223
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:21,366
[SPEAKER_00]: I just say I'm not aware of too many communities where counselors have like district offices.

224
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:34,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only thing I point out is, and I know you're on your phone, Marilyn, so you can't see, but the language I'm looking at that's drafted looks fairly similar to other provisions like that.

225
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:37,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

226
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

227
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:48,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to decide on this issue one way or the other?

228
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:56,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should vote.

229
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:56,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Jean?

230
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:03,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess I'm thinking just how this, like if,

231
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:28,630
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a controversial move, say a counselor is moving not because they're caring for a sick relative, so it's like a temporary thing, but they've completely moved to a new residence and the ward is unhappy, would the recall be an option for them?

232
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:35,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we will have the recall provision as opposed to something in here where

233
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:44,254
[SPEAKER_07]: that temporary move would be treated the same as someone who's moving out permanently.

234
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:47,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

235
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:50,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron and then Eunice.

236
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:59,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for full context of this, is there a decision made on how we replace?

237
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:04,124
[SPEAKER_06]: I know probably the at-large

238
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,482
[SPEAKER_06]: counselors would be next up gets it?

239
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:13,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Or have we talked about, is it next up in wards as well?

240
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:18,714
[SPEAKER_02]: Later in this section, the vacancies provisions are addressed, so.

241
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:26,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just wondering how easy, because it makes a difference if we have to have an election every time this happens.

242
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree, Eunice just.

243
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,487
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, now that you say that certainly, you know.

244
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:42,075
[SPEAKER_08]: When it happens, having an election is a boatload of money, but going back to the point of, you know, if somebody moves.

245
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:50,119
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, across the city to care for, well, you know, caring for an elderly relative or whatever the case may be.

246
00:23:50,199 --> 00:24:09,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Or what about somebody who's, you know, maybe been house hunting for a while and, you know, three months or five months into their, you know, they get elected in Ward X and, you know, four or five, six months later, you know, they land their dream house, you know, in a ward across the city.

247
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:13,263
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, what does that say?

248
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:17,326
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they can continue in their original ward.

249
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:39,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, people have all sorts of reasons for moving, but, you know, just moving across the city and continuing to, into a ward that already has a representative because he or she was elected as such, and you're continuing then to,

250
00:24:41,320 --> 00:25:01,364
[SPEAKER_08]: represent the word that you just moved out of, um, you know, couldn't there be some animosity to toward, well, you know, you got elected in ward X and now you've moved over to ward Y, you know, you, you don't have as much of a vested interest in ward X anymore.

251
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:06,425
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that, you know,

252
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:10,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I'm just sort of conflicted here.

253
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:23,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like they should be replaced for somebody who has a vested interest and who's immersed in the world on a day-to-day basis.

254
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:34,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Once you move across the city and get involved in your orbit over there, maybe you're not as

255
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:39,925
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, invested in the original word is you were.

256
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:50,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, Anthony, it sounds like you have a comment and Danielle Danielle has a comment in the chat.

257
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:52,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to speak Danielle?

258
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:56,741
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

259
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:58,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe she can't because.

260
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:00,097
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's too loud where she is.

261
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:00,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

262
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:06,763
[SPEAKER_02]: So Danielle says, I think it matters how long they lived in that ward, in the ward that they were elected in before moving.

263
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:15,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another potential detail that we could look at.

264
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,913
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron and then Anthony.

265
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:27,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think, first of all, putting conditions on whether somebody, you know, health reasons, new house, is just too complicated.

266
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:30,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, I think it's only two years that we're talking about.

267
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:37,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, I'm thinking that if a person is elected in the ward, there's a trust factor in that ward.

268
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:42,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So people aren't going to feel like you're abandoning me because I'm at the other side of the same city.

269
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:45,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm ready to vote on this.

270
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:51,000
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we just really need to start, you know, we've got a huge task to do list.

271
00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:00,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And these kinds of things, I think, well, hopefully it doesn't happen that often, but to me, it's, you're still talking about good people being elected to the city council.

272
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:07,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And whether they are at large or not in the same ward they originally were elected is really a moot point.

273
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:12,227
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's hope that the elected officials are faithful to the entire community.

274
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:18,030
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for those reasons, I suggest we just approve this and move to our next.

275
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

276
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,832
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you want to make a motion, hold that thought.

277
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to hear from Frances because Frances has her hand up.

278
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:33,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, as you know, I can't vote one way or another, but I do want to give you another lens.

279
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:49,047
[SPEAKER_04]: The more conditions that you place on who can be elected, not only does it affect those from minority populations, please think about our persons with disabilities as well.

280
00:27:50,027 --> 00:28:00,075
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very difficult if you are a person with a disability that is a mobile disability that needs a barrier-free residence, right?

281
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:04,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people's disabilities worsen as they age.

282
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:11,824
[SPEAKER_04]: So there may be a need for you to move out of where you currently resided

283
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:16,489
[SPEAKER_04]: while she ran for office in the middle of your term.

284
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:24,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I wanted to give you that lens to work from as a way of guiding your conversation.

285
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:26,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Frances.

286
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:30,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Ron, did you want to make a motion?

287
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:38,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to move for approval of this that we're discussing on the board council eligibility.

288
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:48,676
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to keep the language about regarding ward counselors moving in the middle, during their term.

289
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:50,077
[SPEAKER_06]: As written in yellow.

290
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:53,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

291
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:58,241
[SPEAKER_05]: That states that they can, as long as they live in Medford, they're okay.

292
00:28:58,941 --> 00:28:59,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

293
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I second that motion.

294
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:01,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

295
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:02,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see.

296
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:09,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

297
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:14,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You're asking me a question or you're asking me?

298
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:14,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

299
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:15,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

300
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:16,845
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a roll call vote.

301
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:18,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

302
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:20,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.

303
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:21,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

304
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:23,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony.

305
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

306
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:26,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean.

307
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:27,912
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

308
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:28,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Maureen.

309
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:30,773
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

310
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:34,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Danielle.

311
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Danielle can vote in the chat.

312
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,281
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll watch the chat.

313
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:46,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't see everyone because I'm sharing screens, so sorry.

314
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:48,691
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure I get everybody.

315
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:53,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm voting yes.

316
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:55,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it, Nova.

317
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:56,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get Gene?

318
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got Gene.

319
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm watching the chat to see if Daniel spoke.

320
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:03,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

321
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:10,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's that question is been dealt with, we will keep that language.

322
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:16,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice, were there any other eligibility issues that you wanted to bring to the table?

323
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:21,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I certainly brought up several there and you know, I'll preface this by saying that

324
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:38,615
[SPEAKER_08]: None of these are going to be well received, but these are all things that I've heard within the community that I felt should be addressed in front of the charter committee in order to.

325
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:44,325
[SPEAKER_08]: give the community members that I've heard from a voice.

326
00:30:45,926 --> 00:31:00,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to another one that I wrote, minimum length of residency in Medford, and I came across something in a charter in Chicopee.

327
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:18,461
[SPEAKER_08]: No person shall be eligible to any of the offices of city government except superintendent of schools, city solicitor and city engineer, unless he is a citizen and has been a resident of the city for at least two years.

328
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:24,262
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the number that they chose.

329
00:31:24,402 --> 00:31:25,622
[SPEAKER_08]: We can choose another number.

330
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:26,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be,

331
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,195
[SPEAKER_08]: interested in increasing it.

332
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:57,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, hearing from members of the community where there are people who choose to run for office who don't know the community that well and come in and run without having any understanding of Medford, our history, our culture, our ways of doing things and so forth.

333
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,884
[SPEAKER_08]: and I think it's something that concerns the community.

334
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:05,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just ask where we're looking?

335
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:09,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this on, is it in this section?

336
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:11,147
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not in the draft we have.

337
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:16,148
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it would go under eligibility if it were.

338
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

339
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:22,674
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and we can move on to the others.

340
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:31,236
[SPEAKER_08]: These are, again, other things that I've heard from community members, minimum and maximum ages of candidates.

341
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:40,919
[SPEAKER_08]: There are elected officials who don't have a whole lot of life experience running our city and big budgets and so forth.

342
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask what those numbers are, Janice, instead of just saying minimum?

343
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:49,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have an idea of what the maximum and the minimum ages should be?

344
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:59,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Me personally, if it were up to me, I would say probably minimum age of 30, maximum age of maybe 65 or 70.

345
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:00,586
[SPEAKER_08]: I better run this year then.

346
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:06,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe.

347
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:08,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not that far off from it.

348
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:13,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I see you also have homeowner versus renter.

349
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:17,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Should a renter be eligible to serve on the city council?

350
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:31,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess what I would like to first do is ask the Collins Center if there are any laws that, you know, that would affect the ability to put these into the charter.

351
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:39,960
[SPEAKER_02]: That would you know that that maybe that certain that you can't prove you can't prohibit people from running for office.

352
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,281
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm wondering.

353
00:33:42,282 --> 00:33:47,006
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just taking trying to look up so off the top of my head it's a little bit tough but

354
00:33:48,966 --> 00:34:08,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think number one, we're not here to give you legal advice, so some of these you might write by a lawyer, but I'm sort of without, with the caveat that I'm not trying to give you legal advice, I don't believe it's permissible to make that distinction between renters and owners and other things of that nature.

355
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:10,842
[SPEAKER_00]: The age piece, I was sort of,

356
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,720
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give me, I'm sure to double check on the constitution.

357
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:22,145
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that all voters are eligible to run for public office.

358
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:23,106
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think that.

359
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,627
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

360
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:36,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so if they meet the age to vote in Massachusetts, they're all eligible to run for office, no matter what age, 18 to whenever.

361
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:41,397
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other piece about the time in,

362
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:51,162
[SPEAKER_00]: The community, I am aware of some cities that, some cities and towns that apply that for employees as well as to members of multi-member boards.

363
00:34:51,182 --> 00:34:56,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware and sort of, I sort of would defer to Maryland's experience.

364
00:34:56,805 --> 00:35:04,169
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of any communities that have those, I personally am not aware of, I can't think of any communities off the top of my head that had that provision for elected officials.

365
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's,

366
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'd be curious to hear from you, Marilyn, what you'd say to that.

367
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think we just go back.

368
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:20,634
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're eligible to vote, you have a domicile in the city, then you can be a candidate for office.

369
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:32,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the reference to Chicopee was to appointed positions, because the city solicitor and city engineer, they would all be appointed positions.

370
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:39,559
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't say appointed, perhaps when no person they are, they are, they are appointed to that.

371
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:40,820
[SPEAKER_08]: No, clearly they are.

372
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:45,003
[SPEAKER_08]: No person shall be eligible to any offices of city government.

373
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:49,867
[SPEAKER_08]: So I interpreted that to mean our elected offices as well.

374
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:54,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm where it lists where it lists certain offices.

375
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:56,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's limited to the offices that are listed.

376
00:35:57,526 --> 00:36:06,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I'm aware of Chicopee's charter and I don't believe that the elected positions have that sort of time in the city prohibition.

377
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:09,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

378
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:15,450
[SPEAKER_02]: And Francis pointed out in the chat that age is actually a protected category.

379
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:22,372
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think that some of these could open up legal questions that we don't have the answers to right now.

380
00:36:24,793 --> 00:36:25,593
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my thought.

381
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, as I said, you know, it's things I've heard within the community.

382
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:34,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt like it should be at least considered.

383
00:36:36,523 --> 00:36:39,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any other comments on this or thoughts?

384
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:48,360
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hear what Eunice is saying.

385
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,385
[SPEAKER_06]: However, you know, the voter is who we have to trust in all these situations.

386
00:36:53,425 --> 00:37:01,112
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, there could be a thousand scenarios where you will like the decision or not like the decision.

387
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:20,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's legalities on age for sure, but I would not vote for those changes, and I keep my faith in the voters even though sometimes I'm disappointed.

388
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:22,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

389
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:47,767
[SPEAKER_08]: can we move on Eunice or do you want do you have any other do you want to uh no as i said i i knew these wouldn't be well received but um you know i feel like i you know should be the voice of the community uh okay thank you um okay uh let's see then

390
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:57,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can just, maybe we could just take a quick vote, Melva, just to see if there's an issue here that we need to investigate, or is it just not?

391
00:37:58,094 --> 00:37:59,075
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to vote on?

392
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:02,958
[SPEAKER_06]: The five items that Eunice has brought up.

393
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:05,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

394
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you articulate the motion?

395
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:08,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

396
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:10,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you want to break them up?

397
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:12,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first one would be the age.

398
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we want to do that many votes.

399
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:24,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we have age, we have home ownership, we have two years at least.

400
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:28,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just paraphrasing what I'm reading here.

401
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:32,983
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Eunice may have better details than I do.

402
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:36,924
[SPEAKER_02]: We could potentially just...

403
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:54,443
[SPEAKER_02]: make motion, you know, vote on whether we want to pursue the eligibility, any of the eligibility issues that were just, you know, the list of eligibility, the length of residency, age for running, home ownership.

404
00:38:56,804 --> 00:39:00,104
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just vote on whether we wanted to look further at those.

405
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:01,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony.

406
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:32,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I would rather that we not, you know, kind of, even let that kind of get into our record as a vote, because I think it will not be well received by the vast majority of the community, and that to kind of, I don't even think we should kind of entertain, you know, those types of restrictions on our community, because,

407
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:42,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just point of information, I mean, if we start restricting people's opinions here, we're not setting a good example either, Anthony.

408
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:53,248
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that this kind of, if I could just finish, this kind of resolution that Eunice has, when we put it up to a vote, we'll know whether the committee agrees with it or not.

409
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:58,430
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I just don't think we should be not taking votes on things that a member brings up in these committees.

410
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:01,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Lori?

411
00:40:03,454 --> 00:40:05,756
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to kind of lean towards Anthony.

412
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:10,059
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just kind of conversation between the committee.

413
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:20,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it has to be brought to the floor for a vote myself, but whatever the committee wants to do on these questions is fine.

414
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:26,711
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, this is more or less discussion, just like we would in a subcommittee or something else like that.

415
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:31,495
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it should be voted on.

416
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:34,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Frances?

417
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:40,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to lend my lens again.

418
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:47,416
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are going to vote, understand that you are voting based on civil rights laws.

419
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:51,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Federal laws override everything else.

420
00:40:52,539 --> 00:41:01,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I would really urge that you seek guidance as to whether or not you can place parameters around age, because elected officials

421
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:09,729
[SPEAKER_04]: do are still considered employees of a specific type for the city, right?

422
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:17,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you start saying that you need to be a certain age, could pose a problem.

423
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:30,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't provide you with the legal guidance, but I would really urge you to, in trying to do the right thing, not create a situation where we are now

424
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:36,429
[SPEAKER_04]: out of compliance or we open up something that we cannot deal with.

425
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:38,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

426
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

427
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:47,314
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm okay with it not going to a vote, but I will say two things.

428
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:56,378
[SPEAKER_08]: First, that, as I said, I feel like I'm bringing something that the community has been asking about,

429
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:12,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can go back now with confidence and say to a community member who might say to me, well, you know, can't we put length of residency in the charter or can't we put, you know, renters are not allowed to serve in the charter.

430
00:42:13,628 --> 00:42:16,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I can go back and say.

431
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,452
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a fulsome discussion about it, and here's where we landed.

432
00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:30,675
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, my opinion on it notwithstanding, I can say with confidence that we dealt with the issue.

433
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:39,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that regardless of how people may feel about any

434
00:42:42,084 --> 00:43:00,060
[SPEAKER_08]: topic or consideration that any of us brings up that it's, you know, there's not an undertone of we shouldn't be entertaining that because I think anything that any of us bring to the table is important.

435
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:04,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Eunice.

436
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:06,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony Wilson, do you want to say something?

437
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:20,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just wanted to, I'm in no way trying to overcomplicate this or add to the complicated nature of the discussion, but I just want the body to be fully informed.

438
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:33,282
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just been sort of searching furiously while you're having the conversation and Worcester does have a one year residency requirement for its counselors and Boston has one as well.

439
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:36,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

440
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:38,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

441
00:43:39,498 --> 00:43:41,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron, is that you?

442
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:43,000
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Ron.

443
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,480
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of things.

444
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,283
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, I don't want to set a precedent for not allowing things to go onto the floor.

445
00:43:49,763 --> 00:44:04,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, since we're not going to vote on it, I want to be on the record as saying I am against age, home ownership, renters serving on the council, all the other issues.

446
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,231
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm totally against those limitations.

447
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to be on the record since we're not going to be able to vote.

448
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

449
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:19,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

450
00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:23,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we move on or are we okay with this eligibility section as it is?

451
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean has her hand up.

452
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:28,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

453
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:31,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's okay, Melba.

454
00:44:31,397 --> 00:44:34,540
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're moving on, I have a moving on from this question.

455
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:39,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, go ahead.

456
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:42,711
[SPEAKER_07]: This maybe will just be in the drafting.

457
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:46,653
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanna, a couple of things I noticed when I was reviewing it today.

458
00:44:47,593 --> 00:44:55,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Some places we say eight wards, then another place we say city council can determine the number of wards.

459
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're gonna get to that.

460
00:44:58,398 --> 00:44:59,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

461
00:45:00,438 --> 00:45:04,420
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also in the eligibility, it came up in the,

462
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:10,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it says, yeah, that's in the eligibility also.

463
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:16,766
[SPEAKER_07]: And then sometimes we have eight counselors, which I think we mean two-thirds.

464
00:45:16,826 --> 00:45:19,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, those are just little things I noticed that I think.

465
00:45:19,387 --> 00:45:22,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was, yeah, okay.

466
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:23,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, though.

467
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:23,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are good.

468
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:28,051
[SPEAKER_02]: There may very well be details that are a little off, so.

469
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:28,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

470
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:36,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully maybe you can note those and we can look at them later.

471
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:41,838
[SPEAKER_02]: The next section is powers and duties.

472
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:49,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute, was there a term as well?

473
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:58,269
[SPEAKER_08]: We answered one of the things about moving out of the city, but the other one I had a little need to clarify this and that's in

474
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:05,317
[SPEAKER_08]: section 22 eligibility attorney of section 10 dash question mark, question mark, question mark.

475
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:07,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's because we haven't done section 10 yet.

476
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:09,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good point.

477
00:46:09,498 --> 00:46:11,960
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the question marks are there.

478
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure we don't, you know, miss it later.

479
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:19,563
[SPEAKER_02]: But I and we were using language from other charters.

480
00:46:19,703 --> 00:46:25,706
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't I don't know.

481
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:26,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

482
00:46:27,983 --> 00:46:29,324
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll look at that too.

483
00:46:29,344 --> 00:46:33,088
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's probably definitely some cleaning up that will have to be done.

484
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Powers and duties.

485
00:46:37,772 --> 00:46:39,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have questions on this section?

486
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:43,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

487
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,939
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple of things.

488
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:54,986
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the way it seems to be written now is that the president and vice president

489
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:03,115
[SPEAKER_08]: are elected at the beginning of a term and serve the entire term.

490
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:17,031
[SPEAKER_08]: My question was, should they serve for two years, which is in essence a full term, or should they serve for one year and then relinquish those positions?

491
00:47:17,952 --> 00:47:19,292
[SPEAKER_08]: and somebody else gets a shot.

492
00:47:19,912 --> 00:47:42,218
[SPEAKER_08]: The second year, I know that we're talking over in the school committee subcommittee, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think a couple of my fellow committee members are here, that those positions are going to be one year only and they will rotate around.

493
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:47,539
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm wondering if the same should be done here.

494
00:47:50,585 --> 00:48:01,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea would be for the council to elect a president and vice president annually instead of?

495
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

496
00:48:03,017 --> 00:48:03,357
OK.

497
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:10,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Just annually, but someone could do it consecutively.

498
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we did in the school committee?

499
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:15,128
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

500
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:17,729
[SPEAKER_06]: No, right.

501
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the school committee does that already.

502
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,371
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, they're vice chairpersons.

503
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:28,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you talking about the positions rotating.

504
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:35,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a required rotation so that the same person can't.

505
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:38,635
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee side, they already have a chairperson.

506
00:48:39,155 --> 00:48:41,176
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not a chairmanship.

507
00:48:41,696 --> 00:48:43,076
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a vice president.

508
00:48:43,276 --> 00:48:44,017
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a vice chair.

509
00:48:44,437 --> 00:48:45,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And the secretary.

510
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:57,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, I'm just thinking, all I'm saying is, if a council president is doing the job and the councilors want that person to be there, they should not be forced to not pick that person.

511
00:48:58,575 --> 00:49:03,218
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say vote every year to give them options, but not limit their vote.

512
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:06,281
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the way I would like to see it.

513
00:49:08,332 --> 00:49:11,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree fully what Ron was saying.

514
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:13,834
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we want to do it annually, that's fine.

515
00:49:13,874 --> 00:49:24,997
[SPEAKER_01]: But all members annually have a right to be elected or reelected, depending on the consensus of who's running for those positions within that body.

516
00:49:25,017 --> 00:49:26,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

517
00:49:26,617 --> 00:49:27,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Anthony.

518
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,141
[SPEAKER_05]: What is it now?

519
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:36,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know sometimes that the chairpersons have changed midterm.

520
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:45,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember when John Falco decided to run for mayor and Rick Caravello became

521
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:47,094
[SPEAKER_05]: the chair?

522
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:49,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they relinquish the chair?

523
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:54,398
[SPEAKER_05]: How do they decide who's the chair now?

524
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:59,741
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on an annual basis.

525
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:02,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't they do it every two years after the election?

526
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:03,803
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually do it every year.

527
00:50:03,943 --> 00:50:04,964
[SPEAKER_02]: They do do it every year.

528
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:05,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

529
00:50:05,224 --> 00:50:07,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis, can you

530
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:13,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you unmute?

531
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:15,057
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I can unmute.

532
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:16,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you hear me, Melva?

533
00:50:16,158 --> 00:50:20,600
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to agree that I think that if they want, they can have a vote every year.

534
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,902
[SPEAKER_10]: But if someone is consecutive, I think that is the way it should be also.

535
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:26,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to state my agreement with that.

536
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm almost home.

537
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:27,884
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm on my phone.

538
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:31,125
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've been happy to listen in while I've been driving.

539
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:31,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

540
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:32,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

541
00:50:32,606 --> 00:50:32,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

542
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:33,286
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

543
00:50:33,686 --> 00:50:34,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

544
00:50:34,987 --> 00:50:35,407
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

545
00:50:35,507 --> 00:50:37,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now, let's see.

546
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:51,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just trying to find where it says the appointment.

547
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, here we go.

548
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:58,904
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now it says that they do it just after every, you know, after the election.

549
00:50:59,004 --> 00:51:01,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be two years instead of one.

550
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:09,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like there's some thoughts that maybe we should change it to annually.

551
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:20,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Melva, one of the things we talked about at the school committee and Ron and Eunice might back this up is that it may become too much of a workload for someone also.

552
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:24,491
[SPEAKER_10]: So annually, I think might be something that should be considered.

553
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:32,514
[SPEAKER_10]: And the person, like I said, like we've already, you know, I've agreed that with Ron and them, if they wanna continue and they voted, that's great.

554
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:39,877
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, the option to maybe step down from that position, maybe would be something that someone would be looking for.

555
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:41,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

556
00:51:43,831 --> 00:51:53,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony or Marilyn from the Collins Center, do you have any feedback on other communities that maybe do that or how well it might work or anything like that?

557
00:51:57,204 --> 00:52:02,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Operationally, I'm not aware of any issues.

558
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:03,350
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say

559
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:09,172
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I can see, the most communities are on the two-year cycle.

560
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,333
[SPEAKER_00]: It aligns with the election of a new council, the election of the council president.

561
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:15,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

562
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:17,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

563
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:24,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now, the draft we have has it working that way.

564
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:28,339
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's any appetite to change that?

565
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:34,342
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to move that it changes to annual, but

566
00:52:35,223 --> 00:52:37,905
[SPEAKER_06]: the president can run consecutive terms if elected.

567
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:40,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

568
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:44,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we probably don't- I'll second that.

569
00:52:46,312 --> 00:52:46,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

570
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:49,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll do a roll call vote.

571
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:51,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

572
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:52,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

573
00:52:53,598 --> 00:52:53,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.

574
00:52:54,658 --> 00:52:54,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

575
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury.

576
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:57,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

577
00:52:58,482 --> 00:52:58,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Jean.

578
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:02,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

579
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:04,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a strong feeling.

580
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:05,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

581
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:06,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

582
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:07,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis.

583
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:08,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

584
00:53:11,169 --> 00:53:13,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Danielle is here.

585
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,991
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to vote.

586
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:17,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony.

587
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:23,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to abstain because I don't know how the city council does it amongst themselves.

588
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:26,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they have their own kind of mechanism.

589
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:31,291
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to weigh in on it right now.

590
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:32,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm voting no.

591
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:36,753
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think I got everybody who's here.

592
00:53:38,154 --> 00:53:41,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle just put in the chat, she votes no.

593
00:53:41,456 --> 00:53:43,097
[SPEAKER_07]: She votes no.

594
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:53,242
[SPEAKER_02]: That's five yes, two no, one abstain, so the motion carries.

595
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:57,264
[SPEAKER_02]: We will change that language.

596
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:05,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, was there any other issue in this section that people wanted to raise?

597
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:10,382
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I just have one point on the first line of powers and duties.

598
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:18,946
[SPEAKER_06]: that the President sets the agenda, we also have the Article 8 that is looking at how we establish an override to that too.

599
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:24,530
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that conflicts with this writing or it complements it with the Article 8 information.

600
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:29,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you mean the free petition where they petition to get something?

601
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:30,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

602
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that would affect this.

603
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:33,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

604
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

605
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:45,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So Eunice or anybody else had, are there any other questions or issues that you want to raise now?

606
00:54:45,224 --> 00:55:04,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think, you know, when you talk about, you know, regulating proceedings and deciding questions of order and so forth, you know, one thing that I've noticed prior councils and this one now too, I guess, in terms of

607
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:29,709
[SPEAKER_08]: regulating, and I think we may have talked about this elsewhere, is not only regulating the proceedings from the standpoint of the community and keeping order, but also the behavior of the individuals behind the rail.

608
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:42,445
[SPEAKER_08]: and making sure that they're being respectful of the community members that are in front of them and of their colleagues.

609
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:54,096
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been occasions where some of the counselors have not behaved with respect to the residents, and I'm just

610
00:55:55,877 --> 00:56:07,983
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, and I'm wondering, you know, with help from the Collins Center, if there's any and I approached, you know, former President Morrell, I tried to approach Falco about it and couldn't get a hold of them.

611
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,144
[SPEAKER_08]: But if there was any way to.

612
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:22,275
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, deal with the behavior some of the behaviors and, you know, counselor morale had told me there's nothing in the charter that.

613
00:56:23,016 --> 00:56:28,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Allows me to do anything short of saying to, you know, their fellow counselor.

614
00:56:29,242 --> 00:56:34,088
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, could you please not do that anymore and if the behavior continues.

615
00:56:35,197 --> 00:56:40,180
[SPEAKER_08]: There's really nothing they can do because there's nothing in the charter that allows them to do anything.

616
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:59,113
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be, you know, one, one issue and the other one, you know, that's kind of a corollary to it is any sort of attendance issue with the counselors, you know, missing and inordinate amount of meetings.

617
00:56:59,173 --> 00:57:03,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that that has occurred in the past and, you know, I did find,

618
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:16,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Some backup to that, you know, with a couple of different, you know, Barnstable and Beverly both address the issue.

619
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:19,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't find anything regarding meeting control.

620
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:30,109
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if there's something that we can insert where the council president would have some sort of authority to

621
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:39,006
[SPEAKER_08]: do something more than say to their colleague, please don't do that anymore, which doesn't really carry any teeth at all.

622
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:45,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Anthony or Marilyn, do you have any thoughts?

623
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:49,957
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just curious before anything, what was it?

624
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:55,683
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't hear exactly what in Beverly or Barnstable they were addressing their charter.

625
00:57:56,463 --> 00:58:02,767
[SPEAKER_08]: They were addressing the absences issue.

626
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:18,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Barnstable, for example, in section 211, in the event a delegate of the assembly fails to attend regular meetings of the assembly committee meetings and fails to represent the town,

627
00:58:19,237 --> 00:58:24,640
[SPEAKER_08]: within which the delegate was elected for a significant period of time to be established by ordinance.

628
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:37,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Without filing a reasonable excuse with the clerk of the assembly, the assembly of delegates shall notify the board of selectmen in the town, and I think they do regional stuff down there, don't they?

629
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:42,250
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this the county legislature?

630
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,932
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure how Barnstable works in terms of that.

631
00:58:48,282 --> 00:58:50,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Possible does have a county charter.

632
00:58:50,283 --> 00:58:50,883
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that.

633
00:58:51,143 --> 00:58:51,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

634
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:59,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Beverly, it looks like because the words assembly and delegate aren't associated with local government.

635
00:58:59,728 --> 00:58:59,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And they.

636
00:59:05,856 --> 00:59:16,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Reading further, they seem to talk a little bit more about it also in Barnstable and then in Beverly as well with multiple members' bodies.

637
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:25,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't see why we couldn't put something in the charter that just because it hasn't been done before, why not?

638
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:33,917
[SPEAKER_08]: If a counselor is missing an excessive amount of meetings,

639
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:37,792
[SPEAKER_08]: are they really representing the people that elected them?

640
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:42,836
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you want to put in?

641
00:59:42,856 --> 00:59:44,578
[SPEAKER_02]: They're elected.

642
00:59:44,598 --> 00:59:45,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

643
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:49,462
[SPEAKER_02]: They're elected.

644
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:53,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and therein lies the problem.

645
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:57,229
[SPEAKER_06]: But Eunice, they can be recalled, which we're working on.

646
00:59:57,609 --> 00:59:57,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

647
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be the recourse, I think.

648
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:07,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as far as we're aware, no council has the authority to remove someone from office.

649
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:13,874
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be through the recall provision.

650
01:00:15,515 --> 01:00:20,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Which has, you know, huge thresholds, you know.

651
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:30,788
[SPEAKER_08]: But if a councilor, you know, this happened, you know, last term, a councilor missed, you know, in the course of, you know, a two-year period,

652
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:32,637
[SPEAKER_08]: 60 meetings.

653
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Somehow or another, that shouldn't be allowed to happen.

654
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:46,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that was a fluke, but it happened once, not to say that it won't happen again.

655
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:52,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Should the community really have to go through the ordeal of a recall to

656
01:00:56,333 --> 01:01:02,378
[SPEAKER_08]: remove somebody that's week after week after week, simply not showing up.

657
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:11,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only thing we can do about it is a recall that takes a hell of a lot of work.

658
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,450
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Maury, did you want to speak?

659
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, two things.

660
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:26,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear what Eunice is saying, and I understand the individual

661
01:01:29,735 --> 01:01:42,303
[SPEAKER_01]: items that she's talking about, but I don't believe the charter can be micromanaging every part of a description and so forth of job responsibility here.

662
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:54,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, you have a situation like Eunice is referring to, I think recall is the only way of handling it.

663
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,832
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to get back to the election of president and vice president.

664
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:06,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we handle how vice president, if vice president is going to be handled the same as president as far as the annual elections and so forth?

665
01:02:06,396 --> 01:02:07,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they grouped as one?

666
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we only said president.

667
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:11,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought we said both.

668
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:14,220
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm asking.

669
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I missed it.

670
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:18,082
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as it's both, fine.

671
01:02:18,422 --> 01:02:19,402
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I wrote down.

672
01:02:19,422 --> 01:02:20,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

673
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:21,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

674
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:22,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Gene.

675
01:02:25,114 --> 01:02:30,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to Eunice's point about not showing up.

676
01:02:31,317 --> 01:02:39,800
[SPEAKER_07]: We have had in the past councilors who chair subcommittees, and then the subcommittee doesn't meet for two years.

677
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:53,005
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't know if the council president shall appoint all members of all committees of the city council, whether that also means if

678
01:02:54,090 --> 01:03:06,556
[SPEAKER_07]: someone isn't calling a committee meeting for two years as chair, does that mean they could put a new person in charge of the committee or something?

679
01:03:07,076 --> 01:03:11,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's one thing you don't show up to general council meetings.

680
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:14,119
[SPEAKER_07]: If you still have quorum, you can still function.

681
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:21,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But if work is happening in the committee meetings and those committees never meet, that work isn't happening.

682
01:03:21,783 --> 01:03:22,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know if

683
01:03:24,132 --> 01:03:30,295
[SPEAKER_07]: That line there meant that they could also take away an appointment and appoint someone else as chair.

684
01:03:32,657 --> 01:03:33,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony or Marilyn?

685
01:03:36,258 --> 01:03:37,039
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I read.

686
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:48,125
[SPEAKER_02]: That the president could who appoints.

687
01:03:50,048 --> 01:03:57,158
[SPEAKER_02]: The council president who appoints members of all committees could also withdraw that appointment and appoint somebody else.

688
01:03:58,841 --> 01:03:59,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?

689
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:18,073
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my understanding in most communities where the president has the authority to, uh, the president, the president appoints all members to the committee, uh, you know, committees of the city council, including the chairs and inherently carries with that the authority to remove members, uh, or change the chair.

690
01:04:18,573 --> 01:04:21,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Marilyn, I don't know if you have a different opinion on that.

691
01:04:23,395 --> 01:04:26,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm just thinking, wouldn't that be addressed in council rules?

692
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:27,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

693
01:04:30,676 --> 01:04:39,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, so are you saying that this isn't even necessary in the charter where it says the council president shall appoint all members of all committees of the city council.

694
01:04:40,508 --> 01:04:43,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in the, to the extent.

695
01:04:44,803 --> 01:05:01,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Most chars, they have their language about the council's rules and so forth, is merely that the council will pick the day of organization, which I believe that this body has discussed, and will instruct that on the day of organization or at some time thereafter, the body will vote to accept its rules of order or how it will conduct business.

696
01:05:02,328 --> 01:05:05,928
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chars also spell out that you'll meet with a certain frequency.

697
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:24,239
[SPEAKER_00]: and it specifies officers, but it doesn't go into the sort of the gritty details of, you know, what the rules should be, the committees, you know, those powers are inherent in being an officer of the body.

698
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something that we should probably add.

699
01:05:33,265 --> 01:05:37,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a general statement about establishing the rules

700
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,143
[SPEAKER_09]: That makes sense.

701
01:05:40,243 --> 01:05:43,586
[SPEAKER_09]: That should be in, that's in article two.

702
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:47,570
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a standard provision that's always there about.

703
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:48,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.

704
01:05:48,632 --> 01:05:50,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think it's here, so we should.

705
01:05:54,097 --> 01:05:55,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, oh, maybe it's on, maybe it's here.

706
01:05:59,062 --> 01:06:00,424
[SPEAKER_09]: It usually says that they can.

707
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Did they set the date of the meeting by order?

708
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:04,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

709
01:06:04,952 --> 01:06:05,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

710
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:06,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we do have that.

711
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:06,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

712
01:06:07,073 --> 01:06:07,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

713
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:07,993
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

714
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:09,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's coming later.

715
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:26,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But so just before we move on to that, just looking at what you were talking about, Eunice, in terms of you raised two issues, addressing

716
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:31,502
[SPEAKER_02]: conduct during meetings and addressing absences.

717
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:40,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any further discussion we want to have on that or any action we want to try to take on that?

718
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:58,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to just say that I believe that these are elected city council members and they need to establish their own rules, their own processes, their own ways of policing themselves.

719
01:06:58,866 --> 01:07:02,648
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it needs to be part of the charter.

720
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:03,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they have to

721
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:14,021
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to figure out how to work together and how to set their own standards and requirements.

722
01:07:15,822 --> 01:07:23,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we should be delegating to city council how they do their job.

723
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's on them as elected officials.

724
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:33,606
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so can we move on to the next section?

725
01:07:33,626 --> 01:07:34,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any other?

726
01:07:34,786 --> 01:07:34,826
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

727
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:43,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there were any questions on this section, the prohibitions.

728
01:07:44,992 --> 01:07:47,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, maybe there was one.

729
01:07:48,854 --> 01:07:49,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I did find something.

730
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:51,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't remember where I saw it.

731
01:07:51,996 --> 01:07:55,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it might have been in the National Civic League.

732
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:06,201
[SPEAKER_08]: That I indicated in there and neither the city council or any of its members show in any manner.

733
01:08:06,842 --> 01:08:10,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Control or demand the appointment.

734
01:08:10,025 --> 01:08:13,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Or removal of any city administrative office or employee.

735
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:17,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Whom the city manager will be the mayor.

736
01:08:18,973 --> 01:08:21,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Or any subordinate is empowered to a point.

737
01:08:21,216 --> 01:08:23,137
[SPEAKER_08]: You know.

738
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:34,208
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just a little bit concerned about anything, you know, making sure that anything that's HR related would be done within executive session.

739
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:43,475
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you're talking about the section where it says interference with administration?

740
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:44,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

741
01:08:46,317 --> 01:08:46,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

742
01:08:47,238 --> 01:08:51,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are suggesting that we change that language?

743
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:03,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Spammers are out loud and clear tonight on the phone, aren't they?

744
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:11,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

745
01:09:11,621 --> 01:09:21,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wouldn't want to make sure that any sort of personnel issue would be dealt with.

746
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:38,600
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of... Well, I think the employee's right to privacy is a federal guaranteed law, so.

747
01:09:42,302 --> 01:09:42,842
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

748
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:54,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I just think you can't, and I've never seen it, and I don't think you ever will, you'll never see anybody talking about personnel issues because it's against the federal government.

749
01:09:55,729 --> 01:10:03,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I defer to Jean on that one, though.

750
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:04,836
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, Jean, sorry.

751
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:11,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it's complicated, but there's union,

752
01:10:13,886 --> 01:10:14,306
[SPEAKER_07]: issues.

753
01:10:14,407 --> 01:10:22,594
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's state and federal law that would potentially affect this.

754
01:10:22,654 --> 01:10:35,605
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that we decided not to give city council the power to weigh in on city administration officials.

755
01:10:36,806 --> 01:10:37,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Department heads.

756
01:10:37,847 --> 01:10:38,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

757
01:10:38,848 --> 01:10:39,329
[SPEAKER_07]: And so

758
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:53,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that we need that language that's proposed here because they cannot demand appointment or removal.

759
01:10:53,245 --> 01:10:55,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, you've got a point about that.

760
01:10:55,787 --> 01:10:56,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're right.

761
01:10:58,589 --> 01:11:07,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And the interference with administration covers the other part I think you were saying, where basically I read that as saying,

762
01:11:10,246 --> 01:11:31,861
[SPEAKER_07]: they can do inquiries and investigations of the operation of the city, but that they can't direct, like they can't fire or hire or order city officials to do something that's solely the purview of the mayor.

763
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:37,589
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds right.

764
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,930
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it says, too.

765
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:45,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Francis was saying, well, the city clerk is a city council employee.

766
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:52,715
[SPEAKER_07]: But I read this provision as the city clerk is managed by the president as an employee.

767
01:11:52,835 --> 01:11:55,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the supervisor of the city clerk.

768
01:11:56,216 --> 01:11:56,496
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

769
01:11:56,516 --> 01:12:02,278
[SPEAKER_04]: The city clerk reports to the city council through the president.

770
01:12:03,274 --> 01:12:14,746
[SPEAKER_04]: which is why when something is, you know, when we're doing something like in the clerk's office or the clerk is involved in something, a member of city council might be involved, right?

771
01:12:15,747 --> 01:12:23,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't mean that they don't take direction from the mayor, but that's the only position that reports to city council.

772
01:12:23,702 --> 01:12:24,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

773
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:33,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I read, but we'll get to that part, that the president has the ability to hire and fire that position.

774
01:12:33,688 --> 01:12:37,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like a joint city council position, is how I read.

775
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:44,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So that they don't need to go on executive session, but that's my reading of it.

776
01:12:44,354 --> 01:12:51,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if the Collins Center has how it happens in other cities.

777
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:57,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought they'd take a vote of the whole council to renew this.

778
01:12:58,022 --> 01:12:58,462
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

779
01:12:58,523 --> 01:13:00,324
[SPEAKER_07]: They do vote on the city clerk.

780
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:01,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you're right.

781
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,427
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, so maybe we should go to that section.

782
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:08,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we'll be getting to that shortly.

783
01:13:12,794 --> 01:13:18,619
[SPEAKER_02]: There were, well, the compensation language units that we, what we, if I,

784
01:13:21,353 --> 01:13:23,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to phrase it correctly.

785
01:13:23,074 --> 01:13:38,282
[SPEAKER_02]: What we voted on was to say that the city council would pass an ordinance to create a committee, an advisory committee about salaries.

786
01:13:38,342 --> 01:13:43,925
[SPEAKER_02]: The actual compensation would still have to be set by ordinance.

787
01:13:44,705 --> 01:13:48,047
[SPEAKER_02]: This committee would not be able to set salaries.

788
01:13:49,151 --> 01:13:57,257
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would go laid, that would go elsewhere in the charter, but I believe that it wouldn't negate the need for this.

789
01:13:58,137 --> 01:13:58,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

790
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:00,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that, does that make sense?

791
01:14:04,722 --> 01:14:08,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Where do we think that that part is going?

792
01:14:09,105 --> 01:14:12,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthony, Anthony and member Anthony Wilson, we had,

793
01:14:14,986 --> 01:14:27,881
[SPEAKER_02]: We had talked on email about it and then the committee had a meeting that you were not outvoted to recommend the formation of a committee by ordinance to review salaries.

794
01:14:31,085 --> 01:14:32,727
[SPEAKER_02]: What section of the charter would that go in?

795
01:14:34,497 --> 01:14:46,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the formation of the committee to review salaries for, so you're in the section now on compensation, so it could go here where you have language about the city council creating an ordinance.

796
01:14:46,602 --> 01:14:56,505
[SPEAKER_00]: I think off the top of my head, you're talking about just that the city create a committee to review all municipal salaries.

797
01:14:56,686 --> 01:15:02,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to pull that up, I thought I... No, it was just elected officials, not all municipal salaries.

798
01:15:03,269 --> 01:15:09,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I'm blanking on where it should go, but I thought I sent you, I believe I sent you something.

799
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You did, and I'm sorry, so I probably have that somewhere.

800
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:14,713
[SPEAKER_02]: I can look for now.

801
01:15:15,273 --> 01:15:21,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the vote, but this would be a committee that wouldn't actually set the salaries, right?

802
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:24,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The city council still does that.

803
01:15:25,216 --> 01:15:27,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct, the ordinance.

804
01:15:28,317 --> 01:15:29,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So we still need this.

805
01:15:29,877 --> 01:15:31,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

806
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:37,653
[SPEAKER_02]: That other language will just have to find the appropriate place for it.

807
01:15:37,973 --> 01:15:40,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew we had a big long discussion about it.

808
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:43,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

809
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:52,167
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the part now where we get into the meetings and the rules.

810
01:15:52,207 --> 01:15:55,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know if my commentary belonged.

811
01:15:56,543 --> 01:16:04,847
[SPEAKER_08]: here or some of the concerns that I had are more about public engagement and accessibility and so forth.

812
01:16:04,887 --> 01:16:12,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know if they belonged here or over in our public engagement section or what.

813
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:20,014
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that there's some rumblings of

814
01:16:21,914 --> 01:16:24,616
[SPEAKER_08]: concerns about public speaking and so forth.

815
01:16:24,736 --> 01:16:29,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't know where all of that stuff should go.

816
01:16:30,098 --> 01:16:33,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's not here.

817
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:42,425
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say all that stuff, you mean the comments you had about frequency of meetings and times of meetings, et cetera?

818
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

819
01:16:43,788 --> 01:16:58,719
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, you know, to me, you know, I don't know whether that belongs here where it talks about regular meetings or whether it goes over in what is it section eight that we're working on public engagement or what?

820
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:06,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it would be if it's about city council meetings, and when the council would meet, I think that it would go here.

821
01:17:09,549 --> 01:17:20,414
[SPEAKER_02]: This does already address meetings where it says regular meetings of the city council be held at a time and place, fixed by ordinance, etc.

822
01:17:20,815 --> 01:17:21,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

823
01:17:21,835 --> 01:17:36,282
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my feeling that if the city council is putting together an ordinance of when to hold a meeting, they are going to do that to their convenience.

824
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:43,304
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's not always at times convenient for the public.

825
01:17:44,404 --> 01:18:00,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford City Council up until a couple of years ago, and maybe not even that, used to meet weekly at seven o'clock on a Tuesday night for as long as I can remember and since the beginning of time.

826
01:18:03,943 --> 01:18:18,050
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, committee of the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings and so forth, always, always, always began at seven o'clock and the entire group would come together every Tuesday.

827
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:29,916
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, in the last, you know, year to 18 months or so, that has changed considerably where now they're meeting biweekly and they're inserting

828
01:18:31,298 --> 01:18:39,380
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they call them standing committees now, as opposed to subcommittees at six o'clock in the evening.

829
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:58,445
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, if they're going to put that in there, either, you know, by ordinance or by their preference or whatever, I feel like, you know, we should be going back to the seven o'clock because that was what the community expected and what

830
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:09,571
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, no time is perfect for everybody, but the seven o'clock time was what people were used to and what seemed to work best for the community.

831
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:22,520
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like if you allow them to put something in by ordinance, they're going to do it to their convenience, not the convenience of the public and the charter would, you know, supersede an ordinance.

832
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,601
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I put in,

833
01:19:27,903 --> 01:19:30,204
[SPEAKER_08]: the suggestions that I added.

834
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

835
01:19:32,585 --> 01:19:32,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Jean?

836
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:41,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand why you're doing this, Eunice, and I hear that there's a frustration.

837
01:19:42,008 --> 01:19:53,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think all of this is way too specific to be in a charter that's for 10 years and doesn't give the flexibility we need as a city to adapt to

838
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:57,941
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it's way too specific.

839
01:20:03,628 --> 01:20:04,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other thoughts?

840
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:20,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and just to, I understand what Eunice is saying too, and to Jean's point, you know, the path of this document is going right through the desks of the city council.

841
01:20:20,331 --> 01:20:27,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So you gotta realize that, you know, being this specifical, just realistically doesn't fly.

842
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:31,636
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to let them, we have to give them the ability to do their job.

843
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:37,479
[SPEAKER_06]: The recall is our only recourse to correct that.

844
01:20:40,806 --> 01:20:42,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

845
01:20:43,048 --> 01:20:43,689
[SPEAKER_10]: I was muted.

846
01:20:43,749 --> 01:20:45,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't get I couldn't know it.

847
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,151
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was doing this.

848
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:46,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

849
01:20:47,633 --> 01:20:54,720
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I understand that the frustration and I get all that but I'm of the mind also to that.

850
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:01,527
[SPEAKER_10]: These are councils and committees that with elected people on and they

851
01:21:02,845 --> 01:21:06,114
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they set their own agenda and their own rules.

852
01:21:06,334 --> 01:21:11,507
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that if we start tying this to this charter, I think they're overstepping.

853
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,521
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my humble opinion on it.

854
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:15,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know who said it.

855
01:21:16,641 --> 01:21:20,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I think these are professional people, the time and that.

856
01:21:20,822 --> 01:21:22,663
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, of course, I agree with you, Eunice.

857
01:21:22,723 --> 01:21:25,764
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be optimal to have it at a time that was best for the community.

858
01:21:26,264 --> 01:21:34,626
[SPEAKER_10]: But the other point is, too, is that these are people that have to meet and they have to set the time where they can also meet, too, within a certain set time frame.

859
01:21:35,546 --> 01:21:38,927
[SPEAKER_10]: As for rules governing their own assemblies and their own gatherings,

860
01:21:39,396 --> 01:21:40,377
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's theirs.

861
01:21:40,577 --> 01:21:50,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we really are getting into a territory where we're overstepping the parameters of what I see is our role in this.

862
01:21:51,704 --> 01:21:52,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Phyllis.

863
01:21:53,105 --> 01:21:53,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Maury.

864
01:21:54,926 --> 01:21:57,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I understand the frustration.

865
01:21:57,427 --> 01:22:02,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of those citizens of the community that's frustrated with the time going.

866
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:03,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's been...

867
01:22:05,177 --> 01:22:15,760
[SPEAKER_01]: weekly meetings from as long as I can remember, and to have meetings go on until 11, 30, 12, 1 o'clock in the morning, whenever they do it.

868
01:22:16,721 --> 01:22:29,144
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's on a regular basis, it seems, that it's kind of unfair to the public to hang around at a 7 o'clock meeting and not have stuff come onto the floor until 11 or 12 o'clock.

869
01:22:32,425 --> 01:22:41,908
[SPEAKER_01]: if they have people who are interested in things going on and they're waiting five and six hours, maybe they do have to have some restraints put on them.

870
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:58,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying here dictate fully, but to me, the way it's been manipulated these days that they're putting everything into two weeks, yet they want to get paid for a whole year.

871
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:06,349
[SPEAKER_01]: How come their salary isn't prorated for their meetings?

872
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:09,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying that they're only going to meet for two weeks?

873
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,510
[SPEAKER_01]: They meet every other week.

874
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:13,211
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they do.

875
01:23:13,591 --> 01:23:17,052
[SPEAKER_10]: You said they're going to meet for two weeks and want to get paid for the whole year.

876
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that's what I heard.

877
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:19,773
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get paid the whole year.

878
01:23:19,813 --> 01:23:24,754
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on a 52-week salary, but they're only meeting 26 times a year, if that.

879
01:23:28,065 --> 01:23:30,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even that because they only meet twice during the summer.

880
01:23:31,647 --> 01:23:32,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

881
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:35,889
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not in accounting committees.

882
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.

883
01:23:37,771 --> 01:23:48,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying there's a lot of frustration in the community with the different changes that this council has adopted over the last few years.

884
01:23:49,497 --> 01:23:55,881
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen the frustration with people with different agenda items that have come up that they're waiting,

885
01:23:56,381 --> 01:23:59,963
[SPEAKER_01]: to hear four or five, six hours into the meeting before anything comes up.

886
01:24:00,623 --> 01:24:03,084
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe it's- I agree, Mark.

887
01:24:03,144 --> 01:24:05,465
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to leave a meeting because it went on so long.

888
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:07,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's something that we should look like.

889
01:24:07,726 --> 01:24:22,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said earlier, we don't want to micromanage them, but also they have a responsibility to the community to treat the constituency with some kind of proper protocol.

890
01:24:23,654 --> 01:24:25,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I have to say about that.

891
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:37,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we, can I ask Anthony Wilson or Marilyn if what your thoughts are on this or there's.

892
01:24:39,662 --> 01:24:56,330
[SPEAKER_00]: would say generally communities don't there isn't a lot of specificity here some of what I can see on the screen really aligns with what is in most communities fixed by the you know fixed by ordinance fixed by council rules

893
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:06,647
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess in theory you could add more if you wanted to, but, you know, councils could go have long meetings for a number of reasons.

894
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:11,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Budgets usually can be long meetings, you know, that meeting where they have the budget.

895
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:19,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the ideal, there's the realities of governing.

896
01:25:19,277 --> 01:25:26,263
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess, you know, to say they can only have, if I understand the tenor of the conversation, to say they can only have two hour meetings or what have you,

897
01:25:29,308 --> 01:25:33,090
[SPEAKER_00]: you may not be setting it up to be really the most efficient document.

898
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:47,237
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of tend to, would tend to say like, you know, the council will create its rules and it will, you know, it should be required to meet regularly at a certain time that would be,

899
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,627
[SPEAKER_00]: the notice would be given to the public ahead of time.

900
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:55,529
[SPEAKER_00]: They can expect meetings, you know, twice a month, so on and so forth.

901
01:25:55,589 --> 01:26:06,315
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, there isn't a lot of specificity or regulation applied to parameters around those types of rules.

902
01:26:06,976 --> 01:26:13,579
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the suggestion of a meeting saying that the city council shall meet, well, weekly?

903
01:26:13,599 --> 01:26:15,760
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you'd have to give them a vacation.

904
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,421
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just say weekly, I guess.

905
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:21,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I mean, because I feel that's one of the things that I heard.

906
01:26:23,733 --> 01:26:31,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, they prior to, you know, 18 months or so ago, they met.

907
01:26:32,539 --> 01:26:40,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much weekly from probably the 2nd or 3rd week of September to the end of June.

908
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:43,524
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that they always took the.

909
01:26:44,244 --> 01:26:47,846
[SPEAKER_08]: The December holiday week off.

910
01:26:48,446 --> 01:26:48,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And.

911
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:53,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's the schedule they set.

912
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:54,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

913
01:26:55,152 --> 01:26:57,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and that's the schedule that had been in place.

914
01:26:58,013 --> 01:26:58,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

915
01:26:58,573 --> 01:26:59,714
[SPEAKER_08]: The beginning of time.

916
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:00,875
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was set.

917
01:27:01,095 --> 01:27:02,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know about that.

918
01:27:02,816 --> 01:27:05,757
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how long it's been set, but it's been set for a long time.

919
01:27:06,277 --> 01:27:08,579
[SPEAKER_08]: And Maury's been watching them a whole lot longer than that.

920
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:09,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

921
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess a long, long time.

922
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:20,705
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm asking Anthony and Marilyn is, is that a level of specificity that, you know, is,

923
01:27:22,475 --> 01:27:23,216
[SPEAKER_02]: to say weekly.

924
01:27:23,236 --> 01:27:24,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware.

925
01:27:27,739 --> 01:27:29,380
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it is too specific.

926
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:29,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

927
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:37,866
[SPEAKER_09]: And that section of charter gives the council the authority to make rules.

928
01:27:38,106 --> 01:27:48,573
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to say something to the extent that, you know, the council should keep in mind the convenience of the public when setting their schedule.

929
01:27:49,117 --> 01:27:54,341
[SPEAKER_09]: It, you know, begins to get the point across without a whole lot of verbiage.

930
01:27:56,743 --> 01:27:57,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

931
01:27:57,824 --> 01:27:58,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

932
01:28:00,386 --> 01:28:00,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

933
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,407
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've heard discussion on this.

934
01:28:05,109 --> 01:28:07,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the language is what it is.

935
01:28:08,312 --> 01:28:11,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Do people feel, do people want to make any other suggestions or?

936
01:28:16,604 --> 01:28:20,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Clearly there's no appetite for changing much of anything.

937
01:28:20,589 --> 01:28:33,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way things stand now, the council is going to do things the way in which they choose to.

938
01:28:33,823 --> 01:28:43,505
[SPEAKER_08]: which isn't necessarily in the best interest of the community and the frustration that's out there now, that Maury was alluding to.

939
01:28:45,565 --> 01:29:01,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what I was trying to do, and perhaps I can't put words in Maury's mouth, you can speak for yourself, Maury, but I was trying to put things in there that would reduce some of the simmering frustration that's in the community.

940
01:29:02,787 --> 01:29:06,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Evidently, that's not what the charter can do.

941
01:29:13,234 --> 01:29:21,319
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure of the mechanism that we can put in here regarding how to control their actions and what they're doing.

942
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:23,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any way that on

943
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:37,703
[SPEAKER_01]: their adoption of their rules and regulations requiring public meetings and so forth, that they're required to do a certain thing.

944
01:29:37,983 --> 01:29:55,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not quite sure how to say this, but I hear what Eunice is saying, and I hear throughout this city, day in, day out, regarding the way the city council is handling things at this present time for the city.

945
01:29:56,234 --> 01:30:03,659
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people aren't happy with the changes, that their voice isn't being heard any longer.

946
01:30:03,919 --> 01:30:23,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's certain things that I would think that we're not gonna get involved with, but I think on a regular basis of meetings that maybe they, I think their feet should be held to the fire a little bit more than what it's being, than presently constituted right now, the way they're operating.

947
01:30:24,793 --> 01:30:33,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all I mean is I don't know what the mechanism is or the wording or the languages to make them more accountable to the public.

948
01:30:35,061 --> 01:30:38,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anybody has any thoughts or anything like that.

949
01:30:39,164 --> 01:30:40,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I have my hand raised?

950
01:30:41,365 --> 01:30:41,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Anton.

951
01:30:43,507 --> 01:30:50,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just like to add, I appreciate everybody's comments around the city council and

952
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:57,136
[SPEAKER_05]: and the frustration that some members of our community feel.

953
01:30:59,697 --> 01:31:03,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we're expressing our own views.

954
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:06,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't speak for the whole community.

955
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:10,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen all the Facebook stuff.

956
01:31:11,084 --> 01:31:13,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I've sat in on the last couple of

957
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:20,907
[SPEAKER_05]: City Council meetings on Zoom, something I don't usually do, and they're out of the norm.

958
01:31:21,968 --> 01:31:32,559
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something going on right now, and I don't know how long it will last, but it will somehow resolve itself, even if it is through the next election.

959
01:31:33,357 --> 01:31:35,639
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, you know, things will change.

960
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:46,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's our responsibility as a, as a child review commission to, uh, to kind of police and try to control the city council.

961
01:31:46,289 --> 01:31:47,710
[SPEAKER_05]: They were elected by the people.

962
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:49,072
[SPEAKER_05]: They got the votes.

963
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:54,737
[SPEAKER_05]: They have, uh, they have a responsibility to the people that elected them.

964
01:31:55,437 --> 01:31:58,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, it's not our job to kind of

965
01:31:59,008 --> 01:32:03,294
[SPEAKER_05]: regulate their position.

966
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:13,607
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if they want to meet once a month, you know, if that's, you know, their decision and they have the votes to back it up.

967
01:32:15,149 --> 01:32:17,132
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the way it is.

968
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:32,897
[SPEAKER_05]: and for us to try to kind of reach, you know, that part of that government is way out of our purview, our ballpark.

969
01:32:34,798 --> 01:32:46,243
[SPEAKER_05]: We really just can, you know, and somehow if there's a way to kind of voice it in the charter that the city council shall kind of,

970
01:32:47,507 --> 01:33:00,973
[SPEAKER_05]: ask the public for, you know, you know, or, you know, seek recommendations on things, but we can't control them.

971
01:33:01,913 --> 01:33:02,894
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not our job.

972
01:33:03,234 --> 01:33:15,119
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now, there are some vocal people who have, you know, problems with the city council, maybe justly so, maybe not so justly so, you know, that's politics.

973
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:23,192
[SPEAKER_05]: We're, you know, we're not here to kind of help people decide their politics.

974
01:33:24,594 --> 01:33:25,996
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess that's all I want to say.

975
01:33:26,016 --> 01:33:26,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

976
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:30,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Anthony, Phyllis, and then Ron.

977
01:33:31,335 --> 01:33:38,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to ask, and this is a point of information for myself, people may already know this, to whom is the city council responsible to?

978
01:33:39,336 --> 01:33:43,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Like who actually, are they responsible to anyone?

979
01:33:44,777 --> 01:33:47,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there someone that oversees the city council?

980
01:33:48,598 --> 01:33:50,778
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, they're elected, so.

981
01:33:51,178 --> 01:33:52,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know they're elected.

982
01:33:54,799 --> 01:33:56,619
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the boss that I'm aware of.

983
01:33:57,739 --> 01:34:00,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you ask someone at the Collins Center if they have any information on that?

984
01:34:01,907 --> 01:34:07,010
[SPEAKER_09]: So that they're responsible to the voters.

985
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:07,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

986
01:34:08,091 --> 01:34:08,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that.

987
01:34:09,171 --> 01:34:09,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I get that.

988
01:34:10,172 --> 01:34:15,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is just something I know this has nothing to do with this, but this is just a point of clarification myself.

989
01:34:15,795 --> 01:34:21,418
[SPEAKER_10]: So once they're elected, the understanding is then that they can conduct themselves

990
01:34:25,113 --> 01:34:32,738
[SPEAKER_10]: what we hope in a manner befitting to the reason that they were elected because people voted for them who think that they're gonna do the best job for this position.

991
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:38,321
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's no accountability whatsoever.

992
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:43,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I understand where you're trying to go.

993
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:44,685
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't phrase it like that.

994
01:34:44,725 --> 01:34:48,987
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be accountable to the ballot ultimately every two years.

995
01:34:49,027 --> 01:34:50,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say that they're not accountable.

996
01:34:51,789 --> 01:34:53,230
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be through the electoral process.

997
01:34:53,878 --> 01:34:55,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, I understand that, Anthony.

998
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:01,904
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm saying in the meantime, in the two years, there's no sense of accountability.

999
01:35:01,945 --> 01:35:06,929
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the mayor couldn't say, OK, you've overstepped, or something like this couldn't happen.

1000
01:35:09,551 --> 01:35:09,811
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1001
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:14,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unless if we get a recall provision into the charter, then

1002
01:35:16,453 --> 01:35:22,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, honestly, I appreciate the couple of minutes here because I just needed to clear that up in my own head.

1003
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:25,416
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to make a point for the charter or against the charter.

1004
01:35:25,436 --> 01:35:26,557
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not my point here.

1005
01:35:27,117 --> 01:35:27,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1006
01:35:27,957 --> 01:35:36,020
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as they're, you know, acting within, you know, federal and state law, they can conduct themselves

1007
01:35:37,445 --> 01:35:40,649
[SPEAKER_08]: In any which way they want is my understanding.

1008
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:45,874
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they have for the past 50 years, this isn't new.

1009
01:35:46,194 --> 01:35:54,123
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had, you know, we've had people who've had issues with the city council as long as I can remember from when I was a child.

1010
01:35:54,696 --> 01:36:04,006
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's been outrage and a certain group hates this council or these councillors.

1011
01:36:04,367 --> 01:36:05,368
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't new.

1012
01:36:05,528 --> 01:36:08,492
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't something that we need to get involved in.

1013
01:36:08,652 --> 01:36:12,316
[SPEAKER_05]: It will ultimately resolve itself.

1014
01:36:12,756 --> 01:36:14,498
[SPEAKER_05]: The people who are

1015
01:36:16,787 --> 01:36:29,777
[SPEAKER_05]: are able to get elected or the people who are, you know, can get the votes, that can get the support, that has the backing of the people.

1016
01:36:30,358 --> 01:36:34,241
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, let the ballot decide.

1017
01:36:34,661 --> 01:36:41,707
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if, I'm sorry, I'll start rambling.

1018
01:36:41,887 --> 01:36:42,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I better shut up.

1019
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:43,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Anthony.

1020
01:36:44,189 --> 01:36:44,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.

1021
01:36:45,813 --> 01:36:47,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, a few points.

1022
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:56,122
[SPEAKER_06]: First to Eunice, if you mandated that this council meet every day, it doesn't make them a better council.

1023
01:36:56,703 --> 01:36:58,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's two different things.

1024
01:36:58,685 --> 01:37:04,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if they met once a month, they could be more effective than one that meets every day.

1025
01:37:05,189 --> 01:37:13,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we must hold on to the recall, because it's really the people's only way of really combating abuse.

1026
01:37:14,298 --> 01:37:23,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also, hopefully, before the meeting ends, I'm going to introduce what I think is a very important piece, which is public participation, which happens to be hitting the city.

1027
01:37:24,428 --> 01:37:25,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not asking to

1028
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:33,955
[SPEAKER_06]: mandate how the city council works, but we, the public, are also a branch of this government.

1029
01:37:34,396 --> 01:37:48,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm hoping that, you know, I know it wasn't on the agenda, but I'm hoping that we can establish some rules of either a subcommittee to get a real handle on the controversy going on with public participation.

1030
01:37:48,932 --> 01:37:51,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I think we have recall.

1031
01:37:51,493 --> 01:37:52,334
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with Anthony.

1032
01:37:52,374 --> 01:37:53,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have the vote.

1033
01:37:54,595 --> 01:38:01,879
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I'm just not, there's just, the micromanaging the situations is not necessarily gonna give you better government, I guess is my point.

1034
01:38:02,019 --> 01:38:15,867
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I do think the people need some power to not have to put up with four years of a mayor, two years of a city council, or two years of a school committee, if the people as a group are disappointed.

1035
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:18,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1036
01:38:19,506 --> 01:38:44,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've discussed this, and we can talk about finding ways to add language, something along the lines of what Marilyn suggested, but specific requirements maybe are not

1037
01:38:45,307 --> 01:38:45,927
[SPEAKER_02]: advisable.

1038
01:38:46,167 --> 01:38:49,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we, are we okay with this?

1039
01:38:49,208 --> 01:39:07,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we can decide to look at some sort of general language that we would, you know, that would sort of reflect the point of view that we would like the city council to take when they set their rules and their meeting times.

1040
01:39:09,935 --> 01:39:13,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But beyond, does any, is there anything else that we want to cover beyond that?

1041
01:39:15,926 --> 01:39:18,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that anything that we put in here is.

1042
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:31,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Necessarily going to have, you know, as mere suggestions or recommendations for how we want things to be conducted.

1043
01:39:31,836 --> 01:39:39,621
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the frustration that's boiling over in the city right now.

1044
01:39:40,462 --> 01:39:40,822
[SPEAKER_08]: With the.

1045
01:39:42,754 --> 01:39:57,138
[SPEAKER_08]: elected officials as currently constituted, if it stays that way, in the future, I don't think that there's anything that we can put in here that would be a mere suggestion or recommendation would have any sort of effect.

1046
01:39:58,418 --> 01:40:05,780
[SPEAKER_08]: We can put language in saying, you know, we recommend that you do things based on the convenience of the community.

1047
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:10,962
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's not an order, so they can

1048
01:40:12,316 --> 01:40:16,801
[SPEAKER_08]: take that whichever way they want, which is probably to say that they won't take it at all.

1049
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:29,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I would be more interested in pursuing what Ron is proposing, um, with some sort of a subcommittee or something.

1050
01:40:29,413 --> 01:40:36,020
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not quite sure what he has in mind that might have more of an effect on how we can

1051
01:40:38,126 --> 01:40:44,091
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can't put it in here, as it is, perhaps is a different place that we can do things.

1052
01:40:44,791 --> 01:40:46,312
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean a different place in the charter?

1053
01:40:47,293 --> 01:40:48,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not quite sure what Ron's proposing.

1054
01:40:48,854 --> 01:40:53,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd certainly like to hear him out in some fashion at the appropriate time.

1055
01:40:53,378 --> 01:40:54,819
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we want to get through this piece.

1056
01:40:55,359 --> 01:41:02,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, rules for public participation, I think would go under rules of procedure.

1057
01:41:02,284 --> 01:41:06,808
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we're sort of in that.

1058
01:41:07,396 --> 01:41:14,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Point right now, I mean, I brought up public participation, you know, to some extent, you know, in the.

1059
01:41:15,781 --> 01:41:21,945
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, blurb that I wrote on the side there, you know, with all meetings should be required to have a period for public.

1060
01:41:22,725 --> 01:41:27,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Comment within the 1st priority so that everybody has sufficient opportunity to speak.

1061
01:41:30,562 --> 01:41:37,546
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, which, so I mean, I, I think that there are some state laws surrounding that.

1062
01:41:37,606 --> 01:41:48,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe Marilyn and or Anthony Wilson can talk about that to a public participation and whether it's reflected in state law or.

1063
01:41:50,753 --> 01:41:53,534
[SPEAKER_00]: The open meeting law does provide provisions.

1064
01:41:53,895 --> 01:41:59,417
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not require public comment under the open meeting law if you read the law in the guide.

1065
01:42:00,538 --> 01:42:06,621
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you definitely could put some language in there.

1066
01:42:07,241 --> 01:42:12,163
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not impermissible to add language around public comment.

1067
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my only suggestion here is

1068
01:42:17,323 --> 01:42:20,947
[SPEAKER_00]: What I guess to be to be to be, I guess, somewhat careful because.

1069
01:42:23,145 --> 01:42:31,311
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the issue, it's an issue sort of that I've actually seen play out where something controversial has come on the agenda.

1070
01:42:34,213 --> 01:42:38,257
[SPEAKER_00]: The charter has, or at least the interpretation is that the charter requires public comment.

1071
01:42:39,417 --> 01:42:48,324
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can spend an entire meeting in public comment and not get to the urgent business that's to be voted on and then have to have,

1072
01:42:49,505 --> 01:43:13,145
[SPEAKER_00]: another meeting and then and then there'd be a sort of a tug and pull about how much public comment to allow at that next meeting um so i think it's something that should not prohibit from from regulating here in the charter um but to be sort of sort of mindful of the impact it could have on the efficiency of meetings okay thank you um when you say it's it's um

1073
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:20,802
[SPEAKER_02]: something that could be in the charter, can you maybe be a little more specific about what type of language would be expected or typical?

1074
01:43:28,265 --> 01:43:32,428
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not aware of any typical language around, particularly in this section.

1075
01:43:32,808 --> 01:43:43,455
[SPEAKER_00]: There is language in the, there's a citizens, I forget the exact section number it is, but there's a section about sort of citizen participation in the model charter that I believe that we sent you.

1076
01:43:43,775 --> 01:43:48,938
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a couple of different mechanisms, the referendum vote, the initiative petition.

1077
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:54,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I've recently seen some language around

1078
01:43:57,104 --> 01:44:12,632
[SPEAKER_00]: the population being able to request like a town hall meeting here's you know I don't know if this will you know how this will land but I think if you would put some language here about that when the council adopts its rules to to

1079
01:44:13,753 --> 01:44:40,672
[SPEAKER_00]: includes language for reasonable, a reasonable period for citizens to be heard at a given council meeting, thereby not sort of requiring a certain time period or certain, that allows the council flexibility and its rules to say, public comment shall be, you know, X amount of time long, commenters will have X time to speak, that way they can adjust, you know, if they have 100 speakers, two minutes per speaker versus they have 10, they might allow more time or less depending on the circumstances.

1080
01:44:43,365 --> 01:44:44,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1081
01:44:46,086 --> 01:44:46,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts?

1082
01:44:56,791 --> 01:44:57,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron.

1083
01:44:58,211 --> 01:44:59,132
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I'll speak again.

1084
01:45:00,372 --> 01:45:10,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, my point is that, you know, I think there needs to be a mechanism in our charter that defines what public participation is across the board.

1085
01:45:13,242 --> 01:45:16,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Five years ago, it was 10 minutes a person.

1086
01:45:16,463 --> 01:45:19,844
[SPEAKER_06]: Two years ago, it went to five, and on Tuesday, it went to three.

1087
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:31,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with what Anthony said about regulating and based on who's there and what's there, but I think a minimum of, actually, I don't, I'm not gonna say what my thoughts are.

1088
01:45:31,688 --> 01:45:39,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I like to keep it open, but I think I would like to see a subcommittee do the kind of research we've done on every other issue here.

1089
01:45:40,272 --> 01:45:42,253
[SPEAKER_06]: We know how to put a survey out in public.

1090
01:45:43,113 --> 01:45:44,074
[SPEAKER_06]: We know how to do that.

1091
01:45:45,134 --> 01:45:54,758
[SPEAKER_06]: To get some information and feedback because people are not happy with the ability to, I've experienced, I'm sure everybody else has experienced it.

1092
01:45:55,579 --> 01:46:00,841
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that my opinion is that this charter is the people's document.

1093
01:46:01,848 --> 01:46:04,869
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that the people represent a part of this government.

1094
01:46:05,469 --> 01:46:12,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there should be rules regulated because right now, as of Tuesday, we're at three minutes and 90 minutes total.

1095
01:46:14,351 --> 01:46:19,112
[SPEAKER_06]: In two years, when we vote again, we can go down to one minute and 60 seconds.

1096
01:46:19,233 --> 01:46:24,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm trying to figure out what the right number is to put it in the charter.

1097
01:46:24,234 --> 01:46:28,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not something that on a whim you can do because you don't like what the people are saying or

1098
01:46:29,475 --> 01:46:30,296
[SPEAKER_06]: for whatever reason.

1099
01:46:30,436 --> 01:46:44,761
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, I'm asking that we formulate a, it doesn't have to be a long, you know, we're talking about one issue, but a public participation subcommittee that will do the research to bring back that says, hey, the people like it this way.

1100
01:46:45,222 --> 01:46:47,062
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what people are saying to us.

1101
01:46:47,783 --> 01:46:50,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And I strongly feel like it should be part of our charter.

1102
01:46:53,323 --> 01:47:13,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree fully with what Ron's saying, and I want to bring it just a step further, and not just focus on public participation, because as Ron hit it right on the head, it's also the people's document on how the government is to be held.

1103
01:47:14,455 --> 01:47:20,458
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should maybe bring up a couple of these topics that we brought up tonight on frequency of meetings.

1104
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:31,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying, maybe Anthony misunderstood, I'm not saying that the meeting should only be two hours, which Anthony brought up.

1105
01:47:31,624 --> 01:47:37,227
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying that they shouldn't start a meeting at seven and have

1106
01:47:39,077 --> 01:47:44,062
[SPEAKER_01]: the public there and their gender items are not coming up until 11 or 11 30.

1107
01:47:45,804 --> 01:47:55,073
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go back, I think it was either four or six years ago when they brought up something and they tabled it and they took it off the table after all the

1108
01:47:56,755 --> 01:48:02,936
[SPEAKER_01]: all the citizens left at 11 30 at night and voted on it to pass it when everyone was down there against it.

1109
01:48:03,096 --> 01:48:22,700
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that maybe, and I think, and I'm going to agree with Ron, I think there's a few items here that maybe we should do in a subcommittee again, and relatively quick, because we're trying to move through this thing and not let this thing sit on the front of the month, but put together a subcommittee and let's hash this out.

1110
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:24,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh,

1111
01:48:25,347 --> 01:48:30,010
[SPEAKER_01]: bring some other suggestions maybe forward on rules and regulations.

1112
01:48:31,491 --> 01:48:41,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess my, I mean, we've, we've been talking in this meeting about sort of the general advisability of not getting specific in the charter.

1113
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:50,862
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I, what I'm hearing is, um, um, a sub, a subcommittee to sort of come up with recommendations for specific,

1114
01:48:52,252 --> 01:49:00,615
[SPEAKER_02]: rules about a time limit for public participation and, you know, number of meetings and things like that.

1115
01:49:00,655 --> 01:49:12,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to... No, I don't think it's so specific as much as it is that it should be protocol that the public has a right and they're not regulated as wants and they just went from two to three minutes.

1116
01:49:13,539 --> 01:49:16,720
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, no one should be up there for 20 minutes either.

1117
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:17,840
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just

1118
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:33,405
[SPEAKER_01]: but to put a guillotine over someone's head to say, okay, you got three minutes, and after three minutes, they turn your microphone off, I'm not entirely sure that that's proper protocol on how city government should be run.

1119
01:49:37,226 --> 01:49:37,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Gene.

1120
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:46,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm just going to say I think city council should have the,

1121
01:49:48,387 --> 01:49:55,432
[SPEAKER_07]: ability to run a reasonable meeting in the time frames they have.

1122
01:49:55,712 --> 01:49:58,274
[SPEAKER_07]: I totally support public participation.

1123
01:49:58,994 --> 01:50:11,043
[SPEAKER_07]: There's multiple ways of providing input to city council, including written testimony, speaking at a meeting, coming to subcommittee meetings.

1124
01:50:12,584 --> 01:50:17,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is some case law, and there's an ACLU opinion on this,

1125
01:50:19,408 --> 01:50:20,849
[SPEAKER_07]: that I looked up and found.

1126
01:50:20,869 --> 01:50:40,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there is some recognition that public needs to have the ability to participate in city council meetings, but also city council has the authority to place some limits on that so they can get like, I think what Anthony Wilson was saying is, so they can get the work done.

1127
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:46,173
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not exactly sure what the subcommittee would do or how it would address that.

1128
01:50:48,255 --> 01:50:51,297
[SPEAKER_07]: But if people are interested in that ACLU opinion, I can share it with them.

1129
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:53,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1130
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:54,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice.

1131
01:50:55,921 --> 01:51:08,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally agree with Ron and even more so with Maury, where I think we need to take things a step further as I continue to reiterate, if it's not in the charter, then

1132
01:51:11,059 --> 01:51:21,923
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, this council or perhaps future councils will do things that are at their will and convenience rather than that of the community.

1133
01:51:22,003 --> 01:51:25,345
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm volunteering to serve on that committee.

1134
01:51:26,365 --> 01:51:29,967
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, be the, I put it together.

1135
01:51:30,187 --> 01:51:35,989
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to get a little more clarity on, cause the different things have been suggested for this subcommittee.

1136
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:38,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1137
01:51:39,216 --> 01:51:44,539
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ron initially just suggested it to look into the issue of public participation.

1138
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:55,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I'm not, I mean, we have a lot we have, we have, we have a lot to do before we finish this.

1139
01:51:55,944 --> 01:51:59,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I'm not entirely convinced we would need a subcommittee.

1140
01:51:59,886 --> 01:52:02,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we could continue to discuss it further.

1141
01:52:02,467 --> 01:52:02,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But

1142
01:52:08,345 --> 01:52:12,627
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't personally see the need for a subcommittee.

1143
01:52:15,048 --> 01:52:15,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say something?

1144
01:52:16,489 --> 01:52:17,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Anthony.

1145
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:23,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand Ron and Eunice and Maury.

1146
01:52:23,272 --> 01:52:27,794
[SPEAKER_05]: You're hearing a lot from the community, and people are frustrated.

1147
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:35,417
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd just like you to understand one thing, that the people that you're hearing from,

1148
01:52:37,225 --> 01:52:43,148
[SPEAKER_05]: are a small, well, maybe they're not, they don't represent the entire city.

1149
01:52:43,628 --> 01:52:51,512
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we're looking at the charter, we have to look at it through the lens of the whole community.

1150
01:52:51,972 --> 01:53:03,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know some of the older, more conservative folks are very upset with the current city council, but that's just the way it is.

1151
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:06,700
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't,

1152
01:53:08,653 --> 01:53:14,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, we can't, we can't, we can't change that in the charter.

1153
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:23,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I just, you know, you know, the future is, is in front of us.

1154
01:53:23,546 --> 01:53:25,708
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we do things differently now.

1155
01:53:25,728 --> 01:53:33,175
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have people on zoom and meetings and people participate on zoom from the comfort of their home, you know, like,

1156
01:53:34,997 --> 01:53:43,982
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, people can email and communicate a lot of ways with their city councilors, and they do.

1157
01:53:44,582 --> 01:53:53,686
[SPEAKER_05]: They get a lot of calls and a lot of, you know, they interact with their constituents, and I don't know why we

1158
01:53:55,657 --> 01:54:03,700
[SPEAKER_05]: We, as a group, think that we can somehow, you know, kind of make those kind of changes.

1159
01:54:05,121 --> 01:54:05,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

1160
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:11,703
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not over the, you know, the city council.

1161
01:54:12,103 --> 01:54:13,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Chilis' question.

1162
01:54:13,464 --> 01:54:15,744
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they are the elected officials.

1163
01:54:16,065 --> 01:54:17,985
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to let them do their job.

1164
01:54:19,126 --> 01:54:19,586
[SPEAKER_05]: We have

1165
01:54:20,775 --> 01:54:25,677
[SPEAKER_05]: A charter isn't supposed to constrain them from governing.

1166
01:54:25,717 --> 01:54:31,499
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to just give them the framework.

1167
01:54:32,359 --> 01:54:38,421
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to go into those weeds, go ahead.

1168
01:54:39,501 --> 01:54:43,402
[SPEAKER_05]: I really believe nothing good can come of it.

1169
01:54:44,243 --> 01:54:45,283
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my opinion.

1170
01:54:46,163 --> 01:54:47,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you, Anthony.

1171
01:54:48,224 --> 01:54:50,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have Ron and Eunice that want to speak.

1172
01:54:50,326 --> 01:54:56,069
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four minutes left, and I want to have time to see if there's anyone from the public that wants to speak.

1173
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:03,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I know we didn't get through very much of our agenda, unfortunately, but I think we had productive discussion.

1174
01:55:03,034 --> 01:55:06,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron, do you want to quickly say what you were going to say?

1175
01:55:07,262 --> 01:55:19,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just quickly, I'm kind of surprised at Anthony's comments because that's all we've done here for 15 months is make decisions on ward representation and things that, you know, we try to listen to the people.

1176
01:55:19,785 --> 01:55:23,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't said how I want the participation to go.

1177
01:55:23,526 --> 01:55:32,228
[SPEAKER_06]: All I asked is that a subcommittee be formed to understand what the length of time each citizen should have based on the information we gather from other cities

1178
01:55:32,668 --> 01:55:33,948
[SPEAKER_06]: and from a quick survey.

1179
01:55:34,008 --> 01:55:43,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, when you say we are the advisory board, that's gonna advise the city council and the mayor and the citizens.

1180
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:47,431
[SPEAKER_06]: So to say that we don't have power, we do have power, we have power to advise.

1181
01:55:47,491 --> 01:55:55,173
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't appreciate that, you know, we shouldn't do these things because it may, you know, hurt the precious city council.

1182
01:55:55,393 --> 01:55:56,194
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my comment.

1183
01:55:56,634 --> 01:55:58,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1184
01:55:58,354 --> 01:56:00,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the opportunity to respond, Ron.

1185
01:56:00,394 --> 01:56:01,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1186
01:56:01,495 --> 01:56:02,415
[SPEAKER_05]: In all due respect,

1187
01:56:04,265 --> 01:56:09,908
[SPEAKER_05]: In all due respect, I find your response.

1188
01:56:15,650 --> 01:56:23,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I'm getting some interference, but what I said, I said because I want to see this.

1189
01:56:25,312 --> 01:56:47,997
[SPEAKER_05]: this charter study committee succeed in putting a charter together that can be taken seriously by the city council, that they will accept and forward to the mayor, that it can be something that can benefit our community, bring it forward, not try

1190
01:56:48,943 --> 01:56:50,064
[SPEAKER_05]: to regulate.

1191
01:56:50,124 --> 01:56:51,565
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not here to regulate.

1192
01:56:51,925 --> 01:56:54,007
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to make recommendations.

1193
01:56:54,487 --> 01:56:56,389
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not a regulatory board.

1194
01:56:56,409 --> 01:57:14,122
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we're getting off track if we think we have any type of power to change the behavior of elected officials through this

1195
01:57:15,147 --> 01:57:19,429
[SPEAKER_05]: through this board, this commission, whatever you want to call it.

1196
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:29,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Do what you feel that you need to do, but I'm telling you, you go into those weeds and we as a committee are not going to come out of it.

1197
01:57:31,134 --> 01:57:31,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1198
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:33,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thanks, Anthony.

1199
01:57:33,631 --> 01:57:35,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Eunice, 30 seconds.

1200
01:57:37,613 --> 01:57:42,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all put a ton of time into this effort for the past however many months.

1201
01:57:42,475 --> 01:57:44,496
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all served on multiple committees.

1202
01:57:45,316 --> 01:57:50,279
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you've got at least two, perhaps three, maybe a couple more,

1203
01:57:51,402 --> 01:58:01,285
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, members willing to put the work in and serve on a committee to further investigate this issue, I think it's a worthy endeavor.

1204
01:58:02,386 --> 01:58:02,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1205
01:58:02,846 --> 01:58:13,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just unclear on exactly what the investigation would entail, so I would like to, we'll put it on the agenda for the next meeting, and we'll continue to discuss that.

1206
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:13,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Phyllis?

1207
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:19,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can't unmute, sorry.

1208
01:58:20,272 --> 01:58:20,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

1209
01:58:21,277 --> 01:58:22,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now you can unmute, I think.

1210
01:58:25,993 --> 01:58:26,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.

1211
01:58:26,961 --> 01:58:31,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think, Melba and everyone, that this has been a long time.

1212
01:58:31,623 --> 01:58:39,467
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that if two people want to put some points together, I'm of the opinion myself that we cannot regulate time in those things.

1213
01:58:40,027 --> 01:58:43,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever that avenue wants to be done, that's fine.

1214
01:58:44,069 --> 01:58:47,990
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that we've got to stop talking about this and move on to something else.

1215
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:53,733
[SPEAKER_10]: If someone wants to make a presentation and put the points on the paper, then we'll do that that way.

1216
01:58:54,891 --> 01:58:55,332
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all.

1217
01:58:55,512 --> 01:58:56,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.

1218
01:58:57,314 --> 01:58:59,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put it on the agenda for the next meeting.

1219
01:58:59,236 --> 01:59:09,287
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the meantime, if any individual member wants to gather information that they think would be helpful to the discussion, that would be fine.

1220
01:59:11,229 --> 01:59:11,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1221
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:14,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see if any members of the public would like to speak.

1222
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:22,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so it's 830.

1223
01:59:23,598 --> 01:59:26,705
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have to end on time because I have something else at 830.

1224
01:59:26,766 --> 01:59:31,678
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, everybody.

1225
01:59:33,723 --> 01:59:35,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn.

1226
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:36,851
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor.

1227
01:59:37,673 --> 01:59:37,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

1228
01:59:38,175 --> 01:59:38,495
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1229
01:59:38,716 --> 01:59:38,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1230
01:59:39,037 --> 01:59:40,120
[SPEAKER_02]: See you in a couple weeks.
