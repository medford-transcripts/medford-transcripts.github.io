1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:00,551
Okay.

2
00:00:00,631 --> 00:00:07,715
Welcome to the April 4th, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

3
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:16,519
Our first item on the agenda is to look at the minutes from our March 7th meeting.

4
00:00:17,259 --> 00:00:18,860
Anyone have a chance to look at them over?

5
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:20,441
Yeah.

6
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:22,642
Okay.

7
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:24,683
Everything looks good.

8
00:00:24,703 --> 00:00:25,283
Move approval.

9
00:00:26,264 --> 00:00:27,024
I'll second that.

10
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:28,285
All in favor?

11
00:00:29,847 --> 00:00:30,047
Aye.

12
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:30,727
Aye.

13
00:00:31,187 --> 00:00:32,067
Okay, great.

14
00:00:32,087 --> 00:00:33,568
So the minutes are accepted.

15
00:00:33,588 --> 00:00:40,549
Let me just take care of Gene here before we get going.

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,070
Okay.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,352
So our first item on the agenda is, well, after the minutes, is Articles 2 and 3.

18
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:56,332
So did everyone have a chance to look over the draft?

19
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:58,933
I know there were some questions on the draft.

20
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:07,612
Do we just want to dive into our questions and comments on that section?

21
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:11,135
Because I know the first ones I noticed were about eligibility.

22
00:01:13,736 --> 00:01:15,698
Can you put it up on the screen so that we can?

23
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:16,018
Okay.

24
00:01:16,378 --> 00:01:16,979
We can do that.

25
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:23,503
Go through it because I know I'm the author of an awful lot of the comments, so my apologies.

26
00:01:26,065 --> 00:01:28,807
Here we are, and I will make them bigger.

27
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:35,024
Okay.

28
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:37,205
So is that big enough?

29
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:38,165
Should I make it a little bigger?

30
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:38,886
A little bigger.

31
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:39,826
Okay.

32
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:45,310
So your first question was here under eligibility, right?

33
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,131
Yeah.

34
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,792
Your first comments, whatever.

35
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:49,933
Right.

36
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:53,915
You know, and I had a lot of thoughts.

37
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:57,057
I think there's a show more on there too.

38
00:01:57,237 --> 00:01:59,558
So here.

39
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm going to move my rail over.

40
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,410
Okay, do you want to just open up?

41
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:10,435
So talk about what you.

42
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:12,236
Yeah.

43
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:18,659
I think, obviously, being a Medford resident and voter goes without saying.

44
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:23,822
And we talked about this a little bit the last time.

45
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:28,585
It's reflected in the minutes about felony convictions.

46
00:02:29,645 --> 00:02:34,628
And I put in there having a clean quarry.

47
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:56,877
with no felonies at any time, or if we, for some reason, can't do that, then if somebody's been convicted of a felony at any point in their lifetime, that if they're going to run, then they need to be completely transparent about it on all of their campaign materials.

48
00:02:58,298 --> 00:02:59,459
And I did notice,

49
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:06,581
I have some of the backup in front of me.

50
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,622
Bear with me here.

51
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:15,266
Everett had something in their charter.

52
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:24,812
It comes under the school committee prohibitions, but it can certainly apply to anybody and I would like it.

53
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:37,189
When we talk about the school committee subcommittee, I'll bring it up there too, but they have in their charter a felony conviction.

54
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:50,978
Any person who has been finally convicted of a state or federal felony shall not be eligible to petition for or serve in any elective or appointive office or position under the city.

55
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:53,039
Then it goes on to say,

56
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:06,386
Any school committee who has been finally convicted of a state or felony shall be deemed to have vacated said office and shall be disqualified from serving in any other elective or appointed office under the city.

57
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:12,588
And this appeared to be an amendment to their charter in October of 2021.

58
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:22,653
And what I found interesting was that it didn't, you know, the first part of it didn't specify, you know,

59
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,318
that the felony had to be...

60
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:36,503
If it happened while in office or something like that, any person who has been finally convicted of a state or felony or federal felony shall not be eligible to serve.

61
00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:44,506
So it didn't matter when the felony occurred, you're not eligible to serve according to their charter.

62
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,447
And as I said, this is under the school committee prohibitions.

63
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:54,910
But it certainly could be applicable for, I would make it applicable for any branch.

64
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,271
or all three of our branches, quite frankly.

65
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,313
When we jump over to the executive branch, I wrote the same thing.

66
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:06,975
That would be one of my feelings.

67
00:05:09,136 --> 00:05:12,218
I'm also of the mind and I know it's a pretty unpopular opinion.

68
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,879
Should we focus on that one and then move on?

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,620
What do you think?

70
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,100
Yeah, probably.

71
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:22,202
I mean, just so we can get through them.

72
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:23,423
Take them one at a time.

73
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:33,117
Okay, does anybody have comments about the... Okay, Jean.

74
00:05:34,077 --> 00:05:43,423
Well, I'd like to hear from the Collins Center how other cities other than Everett deal with this issue.

75
00:05:44,623 --> 00:05:47,385
But in general, I'm not in favor of that.

76
00:05:48,428 --> 00:06:01,099
I think that people who've been through the criminal justice system can be good, if they've served their time, can be good city councilors, mayor.

77
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:18,792
For example, if they had a drug addiction issue, overcame that, they may be able to relate to issues in the community better than someone who has not gone through that type of an issue.

78
00:06:19,914 --> 00:06:39,439
And then we know, or at least I know, and I can present data if people need it, that people of color are in the criminal justice system more than white people for very similar crimes in Massachusetts and nationally.

79
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:47,501
So to me, it has a disproportionate impact on people of color and has been used in other places to keep people of color

80
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:51,043
out of elected office.

81
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:56,745
So those are my two concerns about that, but I'd love to hear from the Collins Center, you know, what other cities have done.

82
00:06:56,765 --> 00:07:01,888
I'd also like to, I'm sorry.

83
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:10,111
Let's let Anthony Wilson answer, and then Anthony, we'll hear your question, okay?

84
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,332
Anthony and Andrea, so Anthony Wilson, go ahead.

85
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,053
And I don't know if Marilyn can,

86
00:07:18,056 --> 00:07:26,359
Oh, she's still on mute, but I'll just say, so there are provisions in charters around the state regarding felony convictions.

87
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:39,983
The majority of the language about felony conviction, if I understand correctly, this is a conversation about whether or not a person can be eligible for office, which I think you mentioned, Everett.

88
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:43,224
The majority, sort of the vast majority of

89
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:59,354
the way that felony convictions are discussed in charters across Massachusetts is in the context of a person being holding office and being, for lack of a better term, ejected from office because of a felony conviction during their tenure.

90
00:07:59,394 --> 00:08:04,077
Marilyn, I don't know if you have anything to add.

91
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:08,340
No, that's the most common provision.

92
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,542
It has to relate to your serving

93
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:16,481
Well, it doesn't relate to your serving in office, but it has to occur while you're serving in office.

94
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,643
Thank you.

95
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:22,064
Anthony Andrea, you had a question or a comment.

96
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:23,425
I just had a comment.

97
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,207
I just had a comment on, you know,

98
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:48,459
the whole issue of somebody who may have had a felony conviction in their past serving or being viewed by the city of Medford as being a citizen in full standing with all the rights and responsibilities and entitlements of the community.

99
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:55,060
If we kind of take it upon ourselves to kind of eliminate

100
00:08:56,066 --> 00:09:05,329
the opportunity of them ever being involved in government, we would be doing like a disservice to not only them, but to our whole community.

101
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:10,350
You know, I believe in rehabilitation and second chances.

102
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,911
I believe in more than second.

103
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:16,092
I believe in, and you know, everybody should always have a chance.

104
00:09:16,492 --> 00:09:22,974
And if they can prove to the community that they can serve and they can be elected,

105
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:44,126
you know, with having a felony in their past or having any kind of transgression, if they can overcome that and have something to give our community, we would be foolish and wrong to deny them.

106
00:09:45,607 --> 00:09:47,407
And I think it's not only morally wrong, I think

107
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,076
those types of provisions.

108
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:56,661
And I know why the one was put in in Everett.

109
00:09:57,201 --> 00:10:04,692
That was due to multiple infractions while in office by people elected and

110
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:12,918
in school positions where they wanted to kind of send a message to the community.

111
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:25,484
I don't believe we need to do that in Medford and I think it would be wise for us to stay very clear of any type of language that kind of portrays us in that light.

112
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:27,445
Thank you.

113
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:28,265
Ron.

114
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:35,039
Yeah, I agree with what Jean and Anthony have said.

115
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:43,763
The only, you know, rehabilitation is, that's what the community is about.

116
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:51,366
However, a conviction, a felony conviction during their term is a black eye on the city.

117
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:53,988
So I would think we have to look at that a little bit harder.

118
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,609
If someone is convicted of a felony,

119
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:09,933
that the process of serving time and their sentence and all that stuff would hang over the city in every level, mayor, city council, and school committee.

120
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:22,859
I think we need to look at the difference between having a history that you served your time and an active felony conviction during your time in office.

121
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:24,739
Okay.

122
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,300
Thank you.

123
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:25,780
Dean.

124
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:29,920
I just want to agree with Ron.

125
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:43,370
I think that's in article or section 10, because we've talked about it before, that if you have a conviction, felony conviction while in office, then that's different.

126
00:11:43,511 --> 00:11:45,792
And I know that's covered in a different section.

127
00:11:45,852 --> 00:11:46,673
I would support that.

128
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,735
A different section of the charter.

129
00:11:49,455 --> 00:11:49,696
Yes.

130
00:11:49,816 --> 00:11:51,677
I think it's like the last section.

131
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:53,899
Can I add to that?

132
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:54,620
OK.

133
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:58,972
In that regard, I agree with everyone.

134
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:02,033
And I don't think it should be even a felony conviction.

135
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:15,639
In some communities where, say, a mayor is accused of a crime and it hasn't been fully litigated and there hasn't been kind of a

136
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,621
a resolution.

137
00:12:17,661 --> 00:12:30,713
I believe that, you know, we as a community should have a mechanism to remove them from office, you know, and not to wait, even wait for a felony conviction.

138
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:37,239
You know, I know that happened in, and I believe somewhere on the South Shore where the mayor was convicted, was

139
00:12:38,538 --> 00:12:52,449
was charged with kind of getting, receiving like kickbacks from a marijuana kind of company and they were under indictment and the town was able to kind of get them out of office.

140
00:12:52,749 --> 00:13:00,735
And it was like right after an election or they would have to wait, you know, sometimes people don't come to trial for, you know, four or five

141
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,311
10 years, you know what I mean?

142
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:04,451
So.

143
00:13:04,571 --> 00:13:07,873
So, we are looking at recall provisions, which I think would.

144
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:08,713
Exactly.

145
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:10,074
Address what you're talking about.

146
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:27,201
So, I want to hear from Maury, but first I just wanted to quickly ask Anthony or Marilyn, what section of the charter, the provision for an elected official to be vacated if they are convicted of a felony while in office, where does that go in the charter?

147
00:13:29,002 --> 00:13:30,923
Usually in the general provision section.

148
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,459
Okay, thank you.

149
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,160
Um, Maury.

150
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:39,863
He's muted.

151
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,903
Oh, Maury.

152
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:41,344
I'm sorry.

153
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:41,864
You're muted.

154
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,441
Here we go.

155
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:43,841
Sorry.

156
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:47,523
I agree with what everyone is saying here.

157
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:53,888
I understand where Eunice is coming from with her proposal, with her critique of it.

158
00:13:54,488 --> 00:14:03,935
I'm one that believes everyone should have an opportunity to right a wrong, and if they've done whatever they can done, made up

159
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:11,225
But whatever they had to, whether it be time served or whatever the case is, everyone has a right to do it.

160
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:17,628
My point was that if you're indicted during your tenure,

161
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:33,518
And I heard what Anthony just said, but if we take that role, we're saying you're guilty without, you know, before you've had your time to claim your innocence through a court of law.

162
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:40,983
So I mean, it's kind of like, it's a touchy feely type situation that I think it just has to play itself out.

163
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:47,567
And if someone really is in trouble, they'll generally just, you know, resign from that position, hopefully.

164
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:57,436
And as you were just saying, we need a vehicle for recall, and that would handle that.

165
00:14:58,517 --> 00:14:59,218
Thank you, Maury.

166
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:03,101
Okay, I don't see any more hands right now.

167
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,745
How do we want to

168
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,943
wrap this part of this because we have a lot to move on to.

169
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:15,526
Does anybody have any other comment?

170
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:20,010
Do we want to try to make any motions on any of these points?

171
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:28,639
Are you going to add the convicted felony during term somewhere?

172
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:30,460
Or do you want to move it?

173
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,184
Well, we could vote to put that in the charter and then just add it to the appropriate section later.

174
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:42,967
So if that's something that people want to look at tonight, we could.

175
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:48,838
Well, I think that's in like section what, nine or 10?

176
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:49,479
Right.

177
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,561
Getting a bit of it today.

178
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:58,924
So I know that there's a, I know there's a provision for, you know, while in office.

179
00:15:59,305 --> 00:15:59,665
Okay.

180
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:02,386
So you're saying you want to wait until we look at that section.

181
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:04,027
Okay.

182
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:05,268
I think that makes sense.

183
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,509
Okay.

184
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:07,950
You know, I,

185
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:16,758
But what I put, because I still believe in it, but, you know, I know that the other piece of being convicted.

186
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:24,990
While in office lands elsewhere in the charter, so I think it makes sense to.

187
00:16:26,043 --> 00:16:31,549
Yeah, to me, it was, you know, sort of 1 in the same sort of 2 different things.

188
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:44,203
So, I mean, if we're going the direction, if it's the will of the group to go in the direction of convicted while in office, then that clearly goes elsewhere in the in the charter.

189
00:16:45,784 --> 00:16:46,866
You know, so be wrong.

190
00:16:48,473 --> 00:17:02,568
So just back to this point, I wasn't involved in the deliberations here, but I thought we talked about when you moved out of your ward, you were resigning from your ward councilor position.

191
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:06,672
Well, that was discussed in the subcommittee.

192
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:23,719
And I think the decision was that it made sense for the person to, if they moved out of their ward and still resided in Medford, that they could finish out their term, which currently is a two-year term.

193
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,242
So it would be less than two years unless they moved the day after they were elected.

194
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:32,524
or the day after they were sworn in.

195
00:17:32,544 --> 00:17:33,165
I'm sorry?

196
00:17:33,245 --> 00:17:50,777
If it's a two-year term and somebody moves three months or even six months into their term, and now you're looking at 18 or 20 months while they're in a different ward than the one that they were elected from.

197
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:56,301
If that's something that people want to

198
00:17:57,756 --> 00:18:09,482
Can we ask the call-in center because I thought it was common protocol that that's what happened when you left your ward, you resigned your position, but maybe the call-in center knows better.

199
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:10,203
Yeah.

200
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:16,326
Anthony or Marilyn, do you have any comments on that?

201
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,231
I'll go first if Maryland does.

202
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:41,539
So I'm not sure if there's a pattern or perhaps a trend, but there are, I would say, there are a variety of communities that do it the way that is articulated here, whereas if you have a ward system and you're still in the city and you move out of the ward, that you continue to be a counselor for that term.

203
00:18:45,201 --> 00:18:46,641
So there's a group in that category.

204
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:56,442
I've seen an equal set of communities where if you leave the ward, you've effectively resigned from office.

205
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:06,188
I think it's, and I'd love to get Marilyn's office, but I think it can be tricky in terms of one thing that happens,

206
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:15,844
on the ground is it can be tricky in terms of, and it comes up usually in the context of eligibility, of proving where someone's residence is.

207
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:33,249
So if you get into a situation in which, you know, someone is claiming that someone has left the ward and wants the person to, you know, resign from office, then it's a tricky question of establishing, you know, where their domicile is.

208
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:37,310
That can be a tricky place to be.

209
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:41,155
Thanks.

210
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:44,036
Marilyn, did you want to add to that?

211
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:54,599
I would say that there is a slight trend to allow the counselor who was elected to complete the term to which elected.

212
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,281
And that's what charters in recent years have provided.

213
00:20:06,707 --> 00:20:14,495
I agree with Anthony that that domicile is an issue, but sometimes you have to take into consideration why the person is moving.

214
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:23,564
Often it's to care for an elderly relative, for example.

215
00:20:25,726 --> 00:20:26,046
Okay.

216
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:27,368
Thank you.

217
00:20:28,128 --> 00:20:28,449
Maury.

218
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:59,273
Maybe something like if we add a clause in there, but as long as they're living, continue to maintain living status within the city, that if they want to continue as a ward alderman for what they were elected to, they must maintain a district office, let's say, in that ward where they're obligated to hold monthly office hours and so forth so the people that elected them still have access to them.

219
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:05,605
I don't know.

220
00:21:06,707 --> 00:21:09,650
Anthony or Marilyn, have you ever seen anything like that in a charter?

221
00:21:10,972 --> 00:21:11,132
No.

222
00:21:12,934 --> 00:21:13,575
You can't do it.

223
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:21,366
I just say I'm not aware of too many communities where counselors have like district offices.

224
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:34,936
I think the only thing I point out is, and I know you're on your phone, Marilyn, so you can't see, but the language I'm looking at that's drafted looks fairly similar to other provisions like that.

225
00:21:37,138 --> 00:21:37,458
Okay.

226
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,600
Okay.

227
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:48,787
Do we want to decide on this issue one way or the other?

228
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:56,213
I think we should vote.

229
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:56,594
Jean?

230
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:03,680
Well, I guess I'm thinking just how this, like if,

231
00:22:05,898 --> 00:22:28,630
If it's a controversial move, say a counselor is moving not because they're caring for a sick relative, so it's like a temporary thing, but they've completely moved to a new residence and the ward is unhappy, would the recall be an option for them?

232
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:35,154
Because we will have the recall provision as opposed to something in here where

233
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:44,254
that temporary move would be treated the same as someone who's moving out permanently.

234
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:47,756
Okay.

235
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:50,997
Ron and then Eunice.

236
00:22:52,098 --> 00:22:59,621
Just for full context of this, is there a decision made on how we replace?

237
00:23:00,742 --> 00:23:04,124
I know probably the at-large

238
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:07,482
counselors would be next up gets it?

239
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:13,168
Or have we talked about, is it next up in wards as well?

240
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:18,714
Later in this section, the vacancies provisions are addressed, so.

241
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:26,663
I'm just wondering how easy, because it makes a difference if we have to have an election every time this happens.

242
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,924
Yeah, I agree, Eunice just.

243
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:34,487
You know, now that you say that certainly, you know.

244
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:42,075
When it happens, having an election is a boatload of money, but going back to the point of, you know, if somebody moves.

245
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:50,119
you know, across the city to care for, well, you know, caring for an elderly relative or whatever the case may be.

246
00:23:50,199 --> 00:24:09,725
Or what about somebody who's, you know, maybe been house hunting for a while and, you know, three months or five months into their, you know, they get elected in Ward X and, you know, four or five, six months later, you know, they land their dream house, you know, in a ward across the city.

247
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:13,263
you know, what does that say?

248
00:24:13,283 --> 00:24:17,326
You know, they can continue in their original ward.

249
00:24:17,346 --> 00:24:39,183
I mean, people have all sorts of reasons for moving, but, you know, just moving across the city and continuing to, into a ward that already has a representative because he or she was elected as such, and you're continuing then to,

250
00:24:41,320 --> 00:25:01,364
represent the word that you just moved out of, um, you know, couldn't there be some animosity to toward, well, you know, you got elected in ward X and now you've moved over to ward Y, you know, you, you don't have as much of a vested interest in ward X anymore.

251
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:06,425
So I think that that, you know,

252
00:25:08,387 --> 00:25:10,609
I don't know, I'm just sort of conflicted here.

253
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:23,519
I feel like they should be replaced for somebody who has a vested interest and who's immersed in the world on a day-to-day basis.

254
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:34,989
Once you move across the city and get involved in your orbit over there, maybe you're not as

255
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:39,925
You know, invested in the original word is you were.

256
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:50,675
Okay, yeah, Anthony, it sounds like you have a comment and Danielle Danielle has a comment in the chat.

257
00:25:51,576 --> 00:25:52,837
Did you want to speak Danielle?

258
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:56,741
I don't know.

259
00:25:56,861 --> 00:25:58,022
Maybe she can't because.

260
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:00,097
So it's too loud where she is.

261
00:26:00,237 --> 00:26:00,578
Okay.

262
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:06,763
So Danielle says, I think it matters how long they lived in that ward, in the ward that they were elected in before moving.

263
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:15,170
So that's another potential detail that we could look at.

264
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,913
Ron and then Anthony.

265
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:27,195
Yeah, I think, first of all, putting conditions on whether somebody, you know, health reasons, new house, is just too complicated.

266
00:26:27,775 --> 00:26:30,459
Number two, I think it's only two years that we're talking about.

267
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:37,637
Number three, I'm thinking that if a person is elected in the ward, there's a trust factor in that ward.

268
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:42,638
So people aren't going to feel like you're abandoning me because I'm at the other side of the same city.

269
00:26:43,678 --> 00:26:45,238
So I'm ready to vote on this.

270
00:26:45,318 --> 00:26:51,000
I think we just really need to start, you know, we've got a huge task to do list.

271
00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:00,782
And these kinds of things, I think, well, hopefully it doesn't happen that often, but to me, it's, you're still talking about good people being elected to the city council.

272
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:07,145
And whether they are at large or not in the same ward they originally were elected is really a moot point.

273
00:27:07,165 --> 00:27:12,227
And let's hope that the elected officials are faithful to the entire community.

274
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:18,030
So, for those reasons, I suggest we just approve this and move to our next.

275
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,230
Okay.

276
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,832
So, if you want to make a motion, hold that thought.

277
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,694
And I just want to hear from Frances because Frances has her hand up.

278
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:33,835
Hi, as you know, I can't vote one way or another, but I do want to give you another lens.

279
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:49,047
The more conditions that you place on who can be elected, not only does it affect those from minority populations, please think about our persons with disabilities as well.

280
00:27:50,027 --> 00:28:00,075
It is very difficult if you are a person with a disability that is a mobile disability that needs a barrier-free residence, right?

281
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:04,898
And some people's disabilities worsen as they age.

282
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:11,824
So there may be a need for you to move out of where you currently resided

283
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:16,489
while she ran for office in the middle of your term.

284
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:24,454
So, you know, I wanted to give you that lens to work from as a way of guiding your conversation.

285
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:26,435
Thank you, Frances.

286
00:28:27,476 --> 00:28:30,098
Okay, Ron, did you want to make a motion?

287
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:38,123
I'd like to move for approval of this that we're discussing on the board council eligibility.

288
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:48,676
So you want to keep the language about regarding ward counselors moving in the middle, during their term.

289
00:28:49,176 --> 00:28:50,077
As written in yellow.

290
00:28:50,957 --> 00:28:53,018
Okay.

291
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:58,241
That states that they can, as long as they live in Medford, they're okay.

292
00:28:58,941 --> 00:28:59,161
Yes.

293
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,162
Okay, I second that motion.

294
00:29:01,182 --> 00:29:01,342
Okay.

295
00:29:01,402 --> 00:29:02,723
And let's see.

296
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:09,981
Eunice.

297
00:29:12,723 --> 00:29:14,264
You're asking me a question or you're asking me?

298
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:14,824
I'm sorry.

299
00:29:14,884 --> 00:29:15,244
I'm sorry.

300
00:29:15,264 --> 00:29:16,845
It's a roll call vote.

301
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:18,586
Yes.

302
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:20,828
Ron.

303
00:29:21,588 --> 00:29:21,888
Yes.

304
00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:23,829
Anthony.

305
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,210
Yes.

306
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:26,771
Jean.

307
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:27,912
Yes.

308
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:28,932
Maureen.

309
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:30,773
No.

310
00:29:33,975 --> 00:29:34,616
Danielle.

311
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:36,617
I don't know if Danielle can vote in the chat.

312
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,281
We'll watch the chat.

313
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:46,209
And I can't see everyone because I'm sharing screens, so sorry.

314
00:29:46,229 --> 00:29:48,691
I just want to make sure I get everybody.

315
00:29:52,254 --> 00:29:53,035
I'm voting yes.

316
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:55,818
I think that's it, Nova.

317
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:56,919
Did you get Gene?

318
00:29:56,959 --> 00:29:58,901
Yeah, I got Gene.

319
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:02,409
I'm watching the chat to see if Daniel spoke.

320
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:03,650
Okay, thank you.

321
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:10,897
Okay, so that's that question is been dealt with, we will keep that language.

322
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:16,322
Eunice, were there any other eligibility issues that you wanted to bring to the table?

323
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:21,546
I mean, I certainly brought up several there and you know, I'll preface this by saying that

324
00:30:24,504 --> 00:30:38,615
None of these are going to be well received, but these are all things that I've heard within the community that I felt should be addressed in front of the charter committee in order to.

325
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:44,325
give the community members that I've heard from a voice.

326
00:30:45,926 --> 00:31:00,691
Going to another one that I wrote, minimum length of residency in Medford, and I came across something in a charter in Chicopee.

327
00:31:02,517 --> 00:31:18,461
No person shall be eligible to any of the offices of city government except superintendent of schools, city solicitor and city engineer, unless he is a citizen and has been a resident of the city for at least two years.

328
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:24,262
That's the number that they chose.

329
00:31:24,402 --> 00:31:25,622
We can choose another number.

330
00:31:25,642 --> 00:31:26,263
I would be,

331
00:31:28,494 --> 00:31:30,195
interested in increasing it.

332
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:57,657
Again, hearing from members of the community where there are people who choose to run for office who don't know the community that well and come in and run without having any understanding of Medford, our history, our culture, our ways of doing things and so forth.

333
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,884
and I think it's something that concerns the community.

334
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:05,045
Can I just ask where we're looking?

335
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:09,146
Is this on, is it in this section?

336
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:11,147
No, it's not in the draft we have.

337
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:16,148
So, but it would go under eligibility if it were.

338
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:18,129
Okay.

339
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:22,674
So, and we can move on to the others.

340
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:31,236
These are, again, other things that I've heard from community members, minimum and maximum ages of candidates.

341
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:40,919
There are elected officials who don't have a whole lot of life experience running our city and big budgets and so forth.

342
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,061
Can I ask what those numbers are, Janice, instead of just saying minimum?

343
00:32:46,441 --> 00:32:49,142
Do you have an idea of what the maximum and the minimum ages should be?

344
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:59,706
Me personally, if it were up to me, I would say probably minimum age of 30, maximum age of maybe 65 or 70.

345
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:00,586
I better run this year then.

346
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:06,821
Maybe.

347
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:08,982
I'm not that far off from it.

348
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:13,465
So, and I see you also have homeowner versus renter.

349
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:17,147
Should a renter be eligible to serve on the city council?

350
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:31,314
And I guess what I would like to first do is ask the Collins Center if there are any laws that, you know, that would affect the ability to put these into the charter.

351
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:39,960
That would you know that that maybe that certain that you can't prove you can't prohibit people from running for office.

352
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:41,281
That's what I'm wondering.

353
00:33:42,282 --> 00:33:47,006
I was just taking trying to look up so off the top of my head it's a little bit tough but

354
00:33:48,966 --> 00:34:08,641
Well, I think number one, we're not here to give you legal advice, so some of these you might write by a lawyer, but I'm sort of without, with the caveat that I'm not trying to give you legal advice, I don't believe it's permissible to make that distinction between renters and owners and other things of that nature.

355
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:10,842
The age piece, I was sort of,

356
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,720
If you give me, I'm sure to double check on the constitution.

357
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:22,145
I believe that all voters are eligible to run for public office.

358
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:23,106
So I don't think that.

359
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,627
That's right.

360
00:34:25,387 --> 00:34:36,214
Yeah, so if they meet the age to vote in Massachusetts, they're all eligible to run for office, no matter what age, 18 to whenever.

361
00:34:37,735 --> 00:34:41,397
On the other piece about the time in,

362
00:34:42,738 --> 00:34:51,162
The community, I am aware of some cities that, some cities and towns that apply that for employees as well as to members of multi-member boards.

363
00:34:51,182 --> 00:34:56,465
I'm not aware and sort of, I sort of would defer to Maryland's experience.

364
00:34:56,805 --> 00:35:04,169
I'm not aware of any communities that have those, I personally am not aware of, I can't think of any communities off the top of my head that had that provision for elected officials.

365
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:05,649
I'm not sure if it's,

366
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,311
So I guess I'd be curious to hear from you, Marilyn, what you'd say to that.

367
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,232
Well, I think we just go back.

368
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:20,634
If you're eligible to vote, you have a domicile in the city, then you can be a candidate for office.

369
00:35:23,014 --> 00:35:32,557
I think that the reference to Chicopee was to appointed positions, because the city solicitor and city engineer, they would all be appointed positions.

370
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:39,559
It didn't say appointed, perhaps when no person they are, they are, they are appointed to that.

371
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:40,820
No, clearly they are.

372
00:35:41,821 --> 00:35:45,003
No person shall be eligible to any offices of city government.

373
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:49,867
So I interpreted that to mean our elected offices as well.

374
00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:54,411
I'm where it lists where it lists certain offices.

375
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:56,973
I think it's limited to the offices that are listed.

376
00:35:57,526 --> 00:36:06,468
Yeah, and I'm aware of Chicopee's charter and I don't believe that the elected positions have that sort of time in the city prohibition.

377
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:09,609
Okay, thank you.

378
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:15,450
And Francis pointed out in the chat that age is actually a protected category.

379
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:22,372
So I do think that some of these could open up legal questions that we don't have the answers to right now.

380
00:36:24,793 --> 00:36:25,593
That's just my thought.

381
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,535
Okay, well, as I said, you know, it's things I've heard within the community.

382
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:34,059
I felt like it should be at least considered.

383
00:36:36,523 --> 00:36:39,627
Does anybody have any other comments on this or thoughts?

384
00:36:46,518 --> 00:36:48,360
And I hear what Eunice is saying.

385
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,385
However, you know, the voter is who we have to trust in all these situations.

386
00:36:53,425 --> 00:37:01,112
So, you know, there could be a thousand scenarios where you will like the decision or not like the decision.

387
00:37:02,974 --> 00:37:20,641
I'm sure there's legalities on age for sure, but I would not vote for those changes, and I keep my faith in the voters even though sometimes I'm disappointed.

388
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:22,941
Okay.

389
00:37:26,274 --> 00:37:47,767
can we move on Eunice or do you want do you have any other do you want to uh no as i said i i knew these wouldn't be well received but um you know i feel like i you know should be the voice of the community uh okay thank you um okay uh let's see then

390
00:37:49,487 --> 00:37:57,514
So we can just, maybe we could just take a quick vote, Melva, just to see if there's an issue here that we need to investigate, or is it just not?

391
00:37:58,094 --> 00:37:59,075
What do you want to vote on?

392
00:38:00,156 --> 00:38:02,958
The five items that Eunice has brought up.

393
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:05,380
Okay.

394
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,782
Can you articulate the motion?

395
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:08,583
Okay.

396
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:10,885
Would you want to break them up?

397
00:38:11,445 --> 00:38:12,966
So the first one would be the age.

398
00:38:14,247 --> 00:38:15,649
I don't know if we want to do that many votes.

399
00:38:16,775 --> 00:38:24,439
Yeah, so we have age, we have home ownership, we have two years at least.

400
00:38:25,799 --> 00:38:28,861
I'm just paraphrasing what I'm reading here.

401
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:32,983
I mean, Eunice may have better details than I do.

402
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:36,924
We could potentially just...

403
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:54,443
make motion, you know, vote on whether we want to pursue the eligibility, any of the eligibility issues that were just, you know, the list of eligibility, the length of residency, age for running, home ownership.

404
00:38:56,804 --> 00:39:00,104
We can just vote on whether we wanted to look further at those.

405
00:39:00,124 --> 00:39:01,765
Anthony.

406
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:32,650
I would rather that we not, you know, kind of, even let that kind of get into our record as a vote, because I think it will not be well received by the vast majority of the community, and that to kind of, I don't even think we should kind of entertain, you know, those types of restrictions on our community, because,

407
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:42,604
Well, just point of information, I mean, if we start restricting people's opinions here, we're not setting a good example either, Anthony.

408
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:53,248
I'm hoping that this kind of, if I could just finish, this kind of resolution that Eunice has, when we put it up to a vote, we'll know whether the committee agrees with it or not.

409
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:58,430
I mean, I just don't think we should be not taking votes on things that a member brings up in these committees.

410
00:40:01,272 --> 00:40:01,872
Okay, Lori?

411
00:40:03,454 --> 00:40:05,756
I'm going to kind of lean towards Anthony.

412
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:10,059
This is just kind of conversation between the committee.

413
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:20,247
I don't think it has to be brought to the floor for a vote myself, but whatever the committee wants to do on these questions is fine.

414
00:40:20,287 --> 00:40:26,711
But to me, this is more or less discussion, just like we would in a subcommittee or something else like that.

415
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:31,495
I don't think it should be voted on.

416
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:34,910
Okay, Frances?

417
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:40,092
I just wanted to lend my lens again.

418
00:40:41,113 --> 00:40:47,416
If you are going to vote, understand that you are voting based on civil rights laws.

419
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:51,858
Federal laws override everything else.

420
00:40:52,539 --> 00:41:01,083
I would really urge that you seek guidance as to whether or not you can place parameters around age, because elected officials

421
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:09,729
do are still considered employees of a specific type for the city, right?

422
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:17,271
So if you start saying that you need to be a certain age, could pose a problem.

423
00:41:17,911 --> 00:41:30,415
I can't provide you with the legal guidance, but I would really urge you to, in trying to do the right thing, not create a situation where we are now

424
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:36,429
out of compliance or we open up something that we cannot deal with.

425
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:38,350
Thank you.

426
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,111
Eunice.

427
00:41:41,111 --> 00:41:47,314
I'm okay with it not going to a vote, but I will say two things.

428
00:41:49,375 --> 00:41:56,378
First, that, as I said, I feel like I'm bringing something that the community has been asking about,

429
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:12,807
And I can go back now with confidence and say to a community member who might say to me, well, you know, can't we put length of residency in the charter or can't we put, you know, renters are not allowed to serve in the charter.

430
00:42:13,628 --> 00:42:16,371
Now I can go back and say.

431
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,452
We had a fulsome discussion about it, and here's where we landed.

432
00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:30,675
You know, my opinion on it notwithstanding, I can say with confidence that we dealt with the issue.

433
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:39,938
I hope that regardless of how people may feel about any

434
00:42:42,084 --> 00:43:00,060
topic or consideration that any of us brings up that it's, you know, there's not an undertone of we shouldn't be entertaining that because I think anything that any of us bring to the table is important.

435
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:04,124
Thank you, Eunice.

436
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:06,406
Anthony Wilson, do you want to say something?

437
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:20,240
Yeah, I just wanted to, I'm in no way trying to overcomplicate this or add to the complicated nature of the discussion, but I just want the body to be fully informed.

438
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:33,282
So I've just been sort of searching furiously while you're having the conversation and Worcester does have a one year residency requirement for its counselors and Boston has one as well.

439
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:36,143
Okay, thank you.

440
00:43:38,399 --> 00:43:38,523
Um...

441
00:43:39,498 --> 00:43:41,739
Ron, is that you?

442
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:43,000
It is Ron.

443
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,480
A couple of things.

444
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:49,283
First of all, I don't want to set a precedent for not allowing things to go onto the floor.

445
00:43:49,763 --> 00:44:04,070
Secondly, since we're not going to vote on it, I want to be on the record as saying I am against age, home ownership, renters serving on the council, all the other issues.

446
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,231
I'm totally against those limitations.

447
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,752
So I just want to be on the record since we're not going to be able to vote.

448
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,121
Okay, thank you.

449
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:19,007
Okay.

450
00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:23,571
Can we move on or are we okay with this eligibility section as it is?

451
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,314
Jean has her hand up.

452
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:28,375
Oh, sorry.

453
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:31,137
Yeah, that's okay, Melba.

454
00:44:31,397 --> 00:44:34,540
If we're moving on, I have a moving on from this question.

455
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:39,610
Okay, go ahead.

456
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:42,711
This maybe will just be in the drafting.

457
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:46,653
I just wanna, a couple of things I noticed when I was reviewing it today.

458
00:44:47,593 --> 00:44:55,737
Some places we say eight wards, then another place we say city council can determine the number of wards.

459
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,057
Yeah, we're gonna get to that.

460
00:44:58,398 --> 00:44:59,778
Okay.

461
00:45:00,438 --> 00:45:04,420
It's also in the eligibility, it came up in the,

462
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:10,483
Yeah, it says, yeah, that's in the eligibility also.

463
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:16,766
And then sometimes we have eight counselors, which I think we mean two-thirds.

464
00:45:16,826 --> 00:45:19,107
Anyways, those are just little things I noticed that I think.

465
00:45:19,387 --> 00:45:22,468
Well, that was, yeah, okay.

466
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:23,169
Thank you, though.

467
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:23,749
Those are good.

468
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:28,051
There may very well be details that are a little off, so.

469
00:45:28,071 --> 00:45:28,651
Okay.

470
00:45:31,972 --> 00:45:36,095
So hopefully maybe you can note those and we can look at them later.

471
00:45:36,315 --> 00:45:41,838
The next section is powers and duties.

472
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:49,543
Wait a minute, was there a term as well?

473
00:45:50,043 --> 00:45:58,269
We answered one of the things about moving out of the city, but the other one I had a little need to clarify this and that's in

474
00:45:59,514 --> 00:46:05,317
section 22 eligibility attorney of section 10 dash question mark, question mark, question mark.

475
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:07,578
Yeah, that's because we haven't done section 10 yet.

476
00:46:08,218 --> 00:46:09,238
Okay, good point.

477
00:46:09,498 --> 00:46:11,960
That's why the question marks are there.

478
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,461
Make sure we don't, you know, miss it later.

479
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:19,563
But I and we were using language from other charters.

480
00:46:19,703 --> 00:46:25,706
So I don't I don't know.

481
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:26,366
Yeah.

482
00:46:27,983 --> 00:46:29,324
We'll look at that too.

483
00:46:29,344 --> 00:46:33,088
You know, there's probably definitely some cleaning up that will have to be done.

484
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,531
Powers and duties.

485
00:46:37,772 --> 00:46:39,613
Do we have questions on this section?

486
00:46:42,756 --> 00:46:43,757
Yeah.

487
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,939
A couple of things.

488
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:54,986
I think the way it seems to be written now is that the president and vice president

489
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:03,115
are elected at the beginning of a term and serve the entire term.

490
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:17,031
My question was, should they serve for two years, which is in essence a full term, or should they serve for one year and then relinquish those positions?

491
00:47:17,952 --> 00:47:19,292
and somebody else gets a shot.

492
00:47:19,912 --> 00:47:42,218
The second year, I know that we're talking over in the school committee subcommittee, and correct me if I'm wrong, I think a couple of my fellow committee members are here, that those positions are going to be one year only and they will rotate around.

493
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:47,539
So I'm wondering if the same should be done here.

494
00:47:50,585 --> 00:48:01,215
So the idea would be for the council to elect a president and vice president annually instead of?

495
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,216
Correct.

496
00:48:03,017 --> 00:48:03,357
OK.

497
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:10,183
Just annually, but someone could do it consecutively.

498
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:13,947
Is that what we did in the school committee?

499
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:15,128
No.

500
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:17,729
No, right.

501
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,230
I think the school committee does that already.

502
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,371
But remember, they're vice chairpersons.

503
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:28,192
I remember you talking about the positions rotating.

504
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:35,634
Having a required rotation so that the same person can't.

505
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:38,635
School committee side, they already have a chairperson.

506
00:48:39,155 --> 00:48:41,176
So it's not a chairmanship.

507
00:48:41,696 --> 00:48:43,076
It's a vice president.

508
00:48:43,276 --> 00:48:44,017
It's a vice chair.

509
00:48:44,437 --> 00:48:45,197
And the secretary.

510
00:48:45,764 --> 00:48:57,834
Right, I'm just thinking, all I'm saying is, if a council president is doing the job and the councilors want that person to be there, they should not be forced to not pick that person.

511
00:48:58,575 --> 00:49:03,218
So I would say vote every year to give them options, but not limit their vote.

512
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:06,281
That would be the way I would like to see it.

513
00:49:08,332 --> 00:49:11,353
I agree fully what Ron was saying.

514
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:13,834
I mean, if we want to do it annually, that's fine.

515
00:49:13,874 --> 00:49:24,997
But all members annually have a right to be elected or reelected, depending on the consensus of who's running for those positions within that body.

516
00:49:25,017 --> 00:49:26,597
Okay.

517
00:49:26,617 --> 00:49:27,538
Go ahead, Anthony.

518
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,141
What is it now?

519
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:36,588
Because I know sometimes that the chairpersons have changed midterm.

520
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:45,480
I remember when John Falco decided to run for mayor and Rick Caravello became

521
00:49:46,334 --> 00:49:47,094
the chair?

522
00:49:47,555 --> 00:49:49,896
Do they relinquish the chair?

523
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:54,398
How do they decide who's the chair now?

524
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:59,741
It's on an annual basis.

525
00:49:59,861 --> 00:50:02,442
Don't they do it every two years after the election?

526
00:50:02,522 --> 00:50:03,803
They actually do it every year.

527
00:50:03,943 --> 00:50:04,964
They do do it every year.

528
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:05,204
Okay.

529
00:50:05,224 --> 00:50:07,945
Phyllis, can you

530
00:50:12,556 --> 00:50:13,236
Can you unmute?

531
00:50:13,937 --> 00:50:15,057
Yes, I can unmute.

532
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:16,038
Can you hear me, Melva?

533
00:50:16,158 --> 00:50:20,600
I just wanted to agree that I think that if they want, they can have a vote every year.

534
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,902
But if someone is consecutive, I think that is the way it should be also.

535
00:50:24,462 --> 00:50:26,183
I just wanted to state my agreement with that.

536
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,023
I'm almost home.

537
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:27,884
I'm on my phone.

538
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:31,125
But I've been happy to listen in while I've been driving.

539
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:31,946
Great.

540
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:32,266
Thank you.

541
00:50:32,606 --> 00:50:32,886
Thank you.

542
00:50:32,906 --> 00:50:33,286
All right.

543
00:50:33,686 --> 00:50:34,227
Thank you.

544
00:50:34,987 --> 00:50:35,407
OK.

545
00:50:35,507 --> 00:50:37,608
So right now, let's see.

546
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:51,042
So I'm just trying to find where it says the appointment.

547
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,163
Oh, here we go.

548
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:58,904
So right now it says that they do it just after every, you know, after the election.

549
00:50:59,004 --> 00:51:01,285
So it would be two years instead of one.

550
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:09,187
And it sounds like there's some thoughts that maybe we should change it to annually.

551
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:20,169
Well, Melva, one of the things we talked about at the school committee and Ron and Eunice might back this up is that it may become too much of a workload for someone also.

552
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:24,491
So annually, I think might be something that should be considered.

553
00:51:25,331 --> 00:51:32,514
And the person, like I said, like we've already, you know, I've agreed that with Ron and them, if they wanna continue and they voted, that's great.

554
00:51:32,534 --> 00:51:39,877
But, you know, the option to maybe step down from that position, maybe would be something that someone would be looking for.

555
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:41,749
Okay.

556
00:51:43,831 --> 00:51:53,881
Anthony or Marilyn from the Collins Center, do you have any feedback on other communities that maybe do that or how well it might work or anything like that?

557
00:51:57,204 --> 00:52:02,809
Operationally, I'm not aware of any issues.

558
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:03,350
I would say

559
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:09,172
From what I can see, the most communities are on the two-year cycle.

560
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:13,333
It aligns with the election of a new council, the election of the council president.

561
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:15,374
Yeah.

562
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:17,915
Okay.

563
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:24,558
Well, right now, the draft we have has it working that way.

564
00:52:25,638 --> 00:52:28,339
And if there's any appetite to change that?

565
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:34,342
I'd like to move that it changes to annual, but

566
00:52:35,223 --> 00:52:37,905
the president can run consecutive terms if elected.

567
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:40,367
Okay.

568
00:52:40,507 --> 00:52:44,871
I think we probably don't- I'll second that.

569
00:52:46,312 --> 00:52:46,592
Okay.

570
00:52:46,672 --> 00:52:49,054
So I'll do a roll call vote.

571
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:51,836
Eunice.

572
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:52,096
Yes.

573
00:52:53,598 --> 00:52:53,998
Ron.

574
00:52:54,658 --> 00:52:54,959
Yes.

575
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,700
Maury.

576
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:57,461
Yes.

577
00:52:58,482 --> 00:52:58,802
Jean.

578
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:02,984
I don't know.

579
00:53:03,044 --> 00:53:04,205
I don't have a strong feeling.

580
00:53:05,686 --> 00:53:05,946
Sure.

581
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:06,406
Yes.

582
00:53:07,367 --> 00:53:07,787
Phyllis.

583
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:08,787
Yes.

584
00:53:11,169 --> 00:53:13,270
I don't know if Danielle is here.

585
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,991
She's going to vote.

586
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:17,552
Anthony.

587
00:53:19,033 --> 00:53:23,296
I'm going to abstain because I don't know how the city council does it amongst themselves.

588
00:53:23,756 --> 00:53:26,217
I think they have their own kind of mechanism.

589
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:31,291
I don't want to weigh in on it right now.

590
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:32,651
I'm voting no.

591
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:36,753
But I think I got everybody who's here.

592
00:53:38,154 --> 00:53:41,396
Danielle just put in the chat, she votes no.

593
00:53:41,456 --> 00:53:43,097
She votes no.

594
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:53,242
That's five yes, two no, one abstain, so the motion carries.

595
00:53:53,502 --> 00:53:57,264
We will change that language.

596
00:54:00,328 --> 00:54:05,856
Okay, was there any other issue in this section that people wanted to raise?

597
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:10,382
No, but I just have one point on the first line of powers and duties.

598
00:54:11,141 --> 00:54:18,946
that the President sets the agenda, we also have the Article 8 that is looking at how we establish an override to that too.

599
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:24,530
I don't know if that conflicts with this writing or it complements it with the Article 8 information.

600
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:29,414
Oh, you mean the free petition where they petition to get something?

601
00:54:30,014 --> 00:54:30,354
Right.

602
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,296
I don't think that would affect this.

603
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:33,917
Okay.

604
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,558
Got it.

605
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:45,184
So Eunice or anybody else had, are there any other questions or issues that you want to raise now?

606
00:54:45,224 --> 00:55:04,438
Yeah, I think, you know, when you talk about, you know, regulating proceedings and deciding questions of order and so forth, you know, one thing that I've noticed prior councils and this one now too, I guess, in terms of

607
00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:29,709
regulating, and I think we may have talked about this elsewhere, is not only regulating the proceedings from the standpoint of the community and keeping order, but also the behavior of the individuals behind the rail.

608
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:42,445
and making sure that they're being respectful of the community members that are in front of them and of their colleagues.

609
00:55:42,546 --> 00:55:54,096
There's been occasions where some of the counselors have not behaved with respect to the residents, and I'm just

610
00:55:55,877 --> 00:56:07,983
And, you know, and I'm wondering, you know, with help from the Collins Center, if there's any and I approached, you know, former President Morrell, I tried to approach Falco about it and couldn't get a hold of them.

611
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,144
But if there was any way to.

612
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:22,275
You know, deal with the behavior some of the behaviors and, you know, counselor morale had told me there's nothing in the charter that.

613
00:56:23,016 --> 00:56:28,522
Allows me to do anything short of saying to, you know, their fellow counselor.

614
00:56:29,242 --> 00:56:34,088
You know, could you please not do that anymore and if the behavior continues.

615
00:56:35,197 --> 00:56:40,180
There's really nothing they can do because there's nothing in the charter that allows them to do anything.

616
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:59,113
So that would be, you know, one, one issue and the other one, you know, that's kind of a corollary to it is any sort of attendance issue with the counselors, you know, missing and inordinate amount of meetings.

617
00:56:59,173 --> 00:57:03,917
And, you know, that that has occurred in the past and, you know, I did find,

618
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:16,445
Some backup to that, you know, with a couple of different, you know, Barnstable and Beverly both address the issue.

619
00:57:17,165 --> 00:57:19,426
I couldn't find anything regarding meeting control.

620
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:30,109
So I don't know if there's something that we can insert where the council president would have some sort of authority to

621
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:39,006
do something more than say to their colleague, please don't do that anymore, which doesn't really carry any teeth at all.

622
00:57:41,068 --> 00:57:45,112
Okay, Anthony or Marilyn, do you have any thoughts?

623
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:49,957
I was just curious before anything, what was it?

624
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:55,683
I didn't hear exactly what in Beverly or Barnstable they were addressing their charter.

625
00:57:56,463 --> 00:58:02,767
They were addressing the absences issue.

626
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:18,117
Barnstable, for example, in section 211, in the event a delegate of the assembly fails to attend regular meetings of the assembly committee meetings and fails to represent the town,

627
00:58:19,237 --> 00:58:24,640
within which the delegate was elected for a significant period of time to be established by ordinance.

628
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:37,247
Without filing a reasonable excuse with the clerk of the assembly, the assembly of delegates shall notify the board of selectmen in the town, and I think they do regional stuff down there, don't they?

629
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:42,250
Is this the county legislature?

630
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,932
I'm not sure how Barnstable works in terms of that.

631
00:58:48,282 --> 00:58:50,243
Possible does have a county charter.

632
00:58:50,283 --> 00:58:50,883
I know that.

633
00:58:51,143 --> 00:58:51,664
Okay.

634
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:59,568
Beverly, it looks like because the words assembly and delegate aren't associated with local government.

635
00:58:59,728 --> 00:58:59,888
And they.

636
00:59:05,856 --> 00:59:16,924
Reading further, they seem to talk a little bit more about it also in Barnstable and then in Beverly as well with multiple members' bodies.

637
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:25,751
But I don't see why we couldn't put something in the charter that just because it hasn't been done before, why not?

638
00:59:28,753 --> 00:59:33,917
If a counselor is missing an excessive amount of meetings,

639
00:59:35,049 --> 00:59:37,792
are they really representing the people that elected them?

640
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:42,836
What would you want to put in?

641
00:59:42,856 --> 00:59:44,578
They're elected.

642
00:59:44,598 --> 00:59:45,058
Yeah.

643
00:59:45,558 --> 00:59:49,462
They're elected.

644
00:59:49,482 --> 00:59:53,265
Yeah, and therein lies the problem.

645
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:57,229
But Eunice, they can be recalled, which we're working on.

646
00:59:57,609 --> 00:59:57,869
Yeah.

647
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:00,512
That would be the recourse, I think.

648
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:07,649
Yeah, as far as we're aware, no council has the authority to remove someone from office.

649
01:00:09,811 --> 01:00:13,874
It would be through the recall provision.

650
01:00:15,515 --> 01:00:20,780
Which has, you know, huge thresholds, you know.

651
01:00:22,181 --> 01:00:30,788
But if a councilor, you know, this happened, you know, last term, a councilor missed, you know, in the course of, you know, a two-year period,

652
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:32,637
60 meetings.

653
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,121
Somehow or another, that shouldn't be allowed to happen.

654
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:46,604
Maybe that was a fluke, but it happened once, not to say that it won't happen again.

655
01:00:48,325 --> 01:00:52,827
Should the community really have to go through the ordeal of a recall to

656
01:00:56,333 --> 01:01:02,378
remove somebody that's week after week after week, simply not showing up.

657
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:11,145
And the only thing we can do about it is a recall that takes a hell of a lot of work.

658
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,450
Hey, Maury, did you want to speak?

659
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,009
Yeah, two things.

660
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:26,664
I hear what Eunice is saying, and I understand the individual

661
01:01:29,735 --> 01:01:42,303
items that she's talking about, but I don't believe the charter can be micromanaging every part of a description and so forth of job responsibility here.

662
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:54,070
Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, you have a situation like Eunice is referring to, I think recall is the only way of handling it.

663
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,832
But I wanted to get back to the election of president and vice president.

664
01:01:58,252 --> 01:02:06,056
Do we handle how vice president, if vice president is going to be handled the same as president as far as the annual elections and so forth?

665
01:02:06,396 --> 01:02:07,437
Are they grouped as one?

666
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:09,317
I thought we only said president.

667
01:02:10,498 --> 01:02:11,679
I thought we said both.

668
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:14,220
That's why I'm asking.

669
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,240
Maybe I missed it.

670
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:18,082
But as long as it's both, fine.

671
01:02:18,422 --> 01:02:19,402
That's what I wrote down.

672
01:02:19,422 --> 01:02:20,243
Thank you.

673
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:21,203
Okay.

674
01:02:22,144 --> 01:02:22,444
Gene.

675
01:02:25,114 --> 01:02:30,196
I was going to Eunice's point about not showing up.

676
01:02:31,317 --> 01:02:39,800
We have had in the past councilors who chair subcommittees, and then the subcommittee doesn't meet for two years.

677
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:53,005
But I didn't know if the council president shall appoint all members of all committees of the city council, whether that also means if

678
01:02:54,090 --> 01:03:06,556
someone isn't calling a committee meeting for two years as chair, does that mean they could put a new person in charge of the committee or something?

679
01:03:07,076 --> 01:03:11,638
I think that's one thing you don't show up to general council meetings.

680
01:03:11,718 --> 01:03:14,119
If you still have quorum, you can still function.

681
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:21,502
But if work is happening in the committee meetings and those committees never meet, that work isn't happening.

682
01:03:21,783 --> 01:03:22,323
I didn't know if

683
01:03:24,132 --> 01:03:30,295
That line there meant that they could also take away an appointment and appoint someone else as chair.

684
01:03:32,657 --> 01:03:33,557
Anthony or Marilyn?

685
01:03:36,258 --> 01:03:37,039
That's how I read.

686
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:48,125
That the president could who appoints.

687
01:03:50,048 --> 01:03:57,158
The council president who appoints members of all committees could also withdraw that appointment and appoint somebody else.

688
01:03:58,841 --> 01:03:59,442
Is that true?

689
01:04:00,885 --> 01:04:18,073
That's my understanding in most communities where the president has the authority to, uh, the president, the president appoints all members to the committee, uh, you know, committees of the city council, including the chairs and inherently carries with that the authority to remove members, uh, or change the chair.

690
01:04:18,573 --> 01:04:21,114
Um, Marilyn, I don't know if you have a different opinion on that.

691
01:04:23,395 --> 01:04:26,317
Well, I'm just thinking, wouldn't that be addressed in council rules?

692
01:04:26,917 --> 01:04:27,057
Yeah.

693
01:04:30,676 --> 01:04:39,808
So, so, so are you saying that this isn't even necessary in the charter where it says the council president shall appoint all members of all committees of the city council.

694
01:04:40,508 --> 01:04:43,452
So, in the, to the extent.

695
01:04:44,803 --> 01:05:01,867
Most chars, they have their language about the council's rules and so forth, is merely that the council will pick the day of organization, which I believe that this body has discussed, and will instruct that on the day of organization or at some time thereafter, the body will vote to accept its rules of order or how it will conduct business.

696
01:05:02,328 --> 01:05:05,928
And the chars also spell out that you'll meet with a certain frequency.

697
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:24,239
and it specifies officers, but it doesn't go into the sort of the gritty details of, you know, what the rules should be, the committees, you know, those powers are inherent in being an officer of the body.

698
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,481
So that's something that we should probably add.

699
01:05:33,265 --> 01:05:37,148
Just a general statement about establishing the rules

700
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,143
That makes sense.

701
01:05:40,243 --> 01:05:43,586
That should be in, that's in article two.

702
01:05:43,807 --> 01:05:47,570
There's a standard provision that's always there about.

703
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:48,471
Yeah, yeah.

704
01:05:48,632 --> 01:05:50,654
And I don't think it's here, so we should.

705
01:05:54,097 --> 01:05:55,779
Maybe, oh, maybe it's on, maybe it's here.

706
01:05:59,062 --> 01:06:00,424
It usually says that they can.

707
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,271
Did they set the date of the meeting by order?

708
01:06:04,391 --> 01:06:04,632
Okay.

709
01:06:04,952 --> 01:06:05,132
Yeah.

710
01:06:05,292 --> 01:06:06,132
Yeah, we do have that.

711
01:06:06,312 --> 01:06:06,873
Okay.

712
01:06:07,073 --> 01:06:07,453
Okay.

713
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:07,993
Sorry.

714
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:09,674
Okay, so it's coming later.

715
01:06:09,754 --> 01:06:26,202
But so just before we move on to that, just looking at what you were talking about, Eunice, in terms of you raised two issues, addressing

716
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:31,502
conduct during meetings and addressing absences.

717
01:06:32,784 --> 01:06:40,153
Is there any further discussion we want to have on that or any action we want to try to take on that?

718
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:58,846
I'd like to just say that I believe that these are elected city council members and they need to establish their own rules, their own processes, their own ways of policing themselves.

719
01:06:58,866 --> 01:07:02,648
I don't think it needs to be part of the charter.

720
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:03,569
I mean, they have to

721
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:14,021
They have to figure out how to work together and how to set their own standards and requirements.

722
01:07:15,822 --> 01:07:23,289
I don't think we should be delegating to city council how they do their job.

723
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,192
I believe that's on them as elected officials.

724
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:33,606
OK, so can we move on to the next section?

725
01:07:33,626 --> 01:07:34,766
Do we have any other?

726
01:07:34,786 --> 01:07:34,826
OK.

727
01:07:39,569 --> 01:07:43,211
I don't think there were any questions on this section, the prohibitions.

728
01:07:44,992 --> 01:07:47,293
Although, maybe there was one.

729
01:07:48,854 --> 01:07:49,895
I did find something.

730
01:07:49,915 --> 01:07:51,956
I can't remember where I saw it.

731
01:07:51,996 --> 01:07:55,738
I think it might have been in the National Civic League.

732
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:06,201
That I indicated in there and neither the city council or any of its members show in any manner.

733
01:08:06,842 --> 01:08:10,005
Control or demand the appointment.

734
01:08:10,025 --> 01:08:13,468
Or removal of any city administrative office or employee.

735
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:17,172
Whom the city manager will be the mayor.

736
01:08:18,973 --> 01:08:21,196
Or any subordinate is empowered to a point.

737
01:08:21,216 --> 01:08:23,137
You know.

738
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:34,208
And I was just a little bit concerned about anything, you know, making sure that anything that's HR related would be done within executive session.

739
01:08:37,911 --> 01:08:43,475
So, you're talking about the section where it says interference with administration?

740
01:08:43,495 --> 01:08:44,075
Right.

741
01:08:46,317 --> 01:08:46,677
Okay.

742
01:08:47,238 --> 01:08:51,121
And you are suggesting that we change that language?

743
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:03,399
Spammers are out loud and clear tonight on the phone, aren't they?

744
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:11,601
Yeah.

745
01:09:11,621 --> 01:09:21,704
I just wouldn't want to make sure that any sort of personnel issue would be dealt with.

746
01:09:24,054 --> 01:09:38,600
in terms of... Well, I think the employee's right to privacy is a federal guaranteed law, so.

747
01:09:42,302 --> 01:09:42,842
That's fine.

748
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:54,989
I mean, I just think you can't, and I've never seen it, and I don't think you ever will, you'll never see anybody talking about personnel issues because it's against the federal government.

749
01:09:55,729 --> 01:10:03,055
I defer to Jean on that one, though.

750
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:04,836
Go ahead, Jean, sorry.

751
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:11,241
Well, I mean, it's complicated, but there's union,

752
01:10:13,886 --> 01:10:14,306
issues.

753
01:10:14,407 --> 01:10:22,594
And so there's state and federal law that would potentially affect this.

754
01:10:22,654 --> 01:10:35,605
But I think that we decided not to give city council the power to weigh in on city administration officials.

755
01:10:36,806 --> 01:10:37,527
Department heads.

756
01:10:37,847 --> 01:10:38,428
Yeah.

757
01:10:38,848 --> 01:10:39,329
And so

758
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:53,044
I don't know that we need that language that's proposed here because they cannot demand appointment or removal.

759
01:10:53,245 --> 01:10:55,686
Yeah, no, you've got a point about that.

760
01:10:55,787 --> 01:10:56,307
Yeah, you're right.

761
01:10:58,589 --> 01:11:07,756
And the interference with administration covers the other part I think you were saying, where basically I read that as saying,

762
01:11:10,246 --> 01:11:31,861
they can do inquiries and investigations of the operation of the city, but that they can't direct, like they can't fire or hire or order city officials to do something that's solely the purview of the mayor.

763
01:11:36,929 --> 01:11:37,589
That sounds right.

764
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:40,930
I think it says, too.

765
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:45,212
And then Francis was saying, well, the city clerk is a city council employee.

766
01:11:45,252 --> 01:11:52,715
But I read this provision as the city clerk is managed by the president as an employee.

767
01:11:52,835 --> 01:11:55,375
So that's the supervisor of the city clerk.

768
01:11:56,216 --> 01:11:56,496
Right.

769
01:11:56,516 --> 01:12:02,278
The city clerk reports to the city council through the president.

770
01:12:03,274 --> 01:12:14,746
which is why when something is, you know, when we're doing something like in the clerk's office or the clerk is involved in something, a member of city council might be involved, right?

771
01:12:15,747 --> 01:12:23,275
Doesn't mean that they don't take direction from the mayor, but that's the only position that reports to city council.

772
01:12:23,702 --> 01:12:24,022
Right.

773
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:33,628
And I think I read, but we'll get to that part, that the president has the ability to hire and fire that position.

774
01:12:33,688 --> 01:12:37,810
It's not like a joint city council position, is how I read.

775
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:44,294
So that they don't need to go on executive session, but that's my reading of it.

776
01:12:44,354 --> 01:12:51,158
I don't know if the Collins Center has how it happens in other cities.

777
01:12:51,917 --> 01:12:57,562
I just thought they'd take a vote of the whole council to renew this.

778
01:12:58,022 --> 01:12:58,462
That's true.

779
01:12:58,523 --> 01:13:00,324
They do vote on the city clerk.

780
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:01,245
Yes, you're right.

781
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,427
But, yeah, so maybe we should go to that section.

782
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:08,311
Okay, we'll be getting to that shortly.

783
01:13:12,794 --> 01:13:18,619
There were, well, the compensation language units that we, what we, if I,

784
01:13:21,353 --> 01:13:23,014
I'm going to phrase it correctly.

785
01:13:23,074 --> 01:13:38,282
What we voted on was to say that the city council would pass an ordinance to create a committee, an advisory committee about salaries.

786
01:13:38,342 --> 01:13:43,925
The actual compensation would still have to be set by ordinance.

787
01:13:44,705 --> 01:13:48,047
This committee would not be able to set salaries.

788
01:13:49,151 --> 01:13:57,257
So that would go laid, that would go elsewhere in the charter, but I believe that it wouldn't negate the need for this.

789
01:13:58,137 --> 01:13:58,718
Okay.

790
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:00,779
Does that, does that make sense?

791
01:14:04,722 --> 01:14:08,364
Where do we think that that part is going?

792
01:14:09,105 --> 01:14:12,748
Anthony, Anthony and member Anthony Wilson, we had,

793
01:14:14,986 --> 01:14:27,881
We had talked on email about it and then the committee had a meeting that you were not outvoted to recommend the formation of a committee by ordinance to review salaries.

794
01:14:31,085 --> 01:14:32,727
What section of the charter would that go in?

795
01:14:34,497 --> 01:14:46,582
Well, the formation of the committee to review salaries for, so you're in the section now on compensation, so it could go here where you have language about the city council creating an ordinance.

796
01:14:46,602 --> 01:14:56,505
I think off the top of my head, you're talking about just that the city create a committee to review all municipal salaries.

797
01:14:56,686 --> 01:15:02,808
I'll have to pull that up, I thought I... No, it was just elected officials, not all municipal salaries.

798
01:15:03,269 --> 01:15:09,251
Yeah, and I'm blanking on where it should go, but I thought I sent you, I believe I sent you something.

799
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:12,932
You did, and I'm sorry, so I probably have that somewhere.

800
01:15:12,952 --> 01:15:14,713
I can look for now.

801
01:15:15,273 --> 01:15:21,115
Yeah, but the vote, but this would be a committee that wouldn't actually set the salaries, right?

802
01:15:21,315 --> 01:15:24,056
The city council still does that.

803
01:15:25,216 --> 01:15:27,657
Correct, the ordinance.

804
01:15:28,317 --> 01:15:29,337
So we still need this.

805
01:15:29,877 --> 01:15:31,198
Okay.

806
01:15:33,869 --> 01:15:37,653
That other language will just have to find the appropriate place for it.

807
01:15:37,973 --> 01:15:40,495
I knew we had a big long discussion about it.

808
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:43,919
Yeah.

809
01:15:46,321 --> 01:15:52,167
This is the part now where we get into the meetings and the rules.

810
01:15:52,207 --> 01:15:55,270
I didn't know if my commentary belonged.

811
01:15:56,543 --> 01:16:04,847
here or some of the concerns that I had are more about public engagement and accessibility and so forth.

812
01:16:04,887 --> 01:16:12,390
I didn't know if they belonged here or over in our public engagement section or what.

813
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:20,014
And I know that there's some rumblings of

814
01:16:21,914 --> 01:16:24,616
concerns about public speaking and so forth.

815
01:16:24,736 --> 01:16:29,318
So I didn't know where all of that stuff should go.

816
01:16:30,098 --> 01:16:33,540
Maybe it's not here.

817
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:42,425
When you say all that stuff, you mean the comments you had about frequency of meetings and times of meetings, et cetera?

818
01:16:43,408 --> 01:16:43,668
Right.

819
01:16:43,788 --> 01:16:58,719
That's, you know, to me, you know, I don't know whether that belongs here where it talks about regular meetings or whether it goes over in what is it section eight that we're working on public engagement or what?

820
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:06,005
Um, it would be if it's about city council meetings, and when the council would meet, I think that it would go here.

821
01:17:09,549 --> 01:17:20,414
This does already address meetings where it says regular meetings of the city council be held at a time and place, fixed by ordinance, etc.

822
01:17:20,815 --> 01:17:21,795
Right.

823
01:17:21,835 --> 01:17:36,282
It's my feeling that if the city council is putting together an ordinance of when to hold a meeting, they are going to do that to their convenience.

824
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:43,304
and that's not always at times convenient for the public.

825
01:17:44,404 --> 01:18:00,572
Medford City Council up until a couple of years ago, and maybe not even that, used to meet weekly at seven o'clock on a Tuesday night for as long as I can remember and since the beginning of time.

826
01:18:03,943 --> 01:18:18,050
you know, committee of the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings and so forth, always, always, always began at seven o'clock and the entire group would come together every Tuesday.

827
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:29,916
And, you know, in the last, you know, year to 18 months or so, that has changed considerably where now they're meeting biweekly and they're inserting

828
01:18:31,298 --> 01:18:39,380
You know, they call them standing committees now, as opposed to subcommittees at six o'clock in the evening.

829
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:58,445
And, you know, if they're going to put that in there, either, you know, by ordinance or by their preference or whatever, I feel like, you know, we should be going back to the seven o'clock because that was what the community expected and what

830
01:18:59,665 --> 01:19:09,571
You know, no time is perfect for everybody, but the seven o'clock time was what people were used to and what seemed to work best for the community.

831
01:19:09,591 --> 01:19:22,520
And I feel like if you allow them to put something in by ordinance, they're going to do it to their convenience, not the convenience of the public and the charter would, you know, supersede an ordinance.

832
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,601
So that's why I put in,

833
01:19:27,903 --> 01:19:30,204
the suggestions that I added.

834
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:31,905
Okay.

835
01:19:32,585 --> 01:19:32,905
Jean?

836
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:41,988
I understand why you're doing this, Eunice, and I hear that there's a frustration.

837
01:19:42,008 --> 01:19:53,553
I just think all of this is way too specific to be in a charter that's for 10 years and doesn't give the flexibility we need as a city to adapt to

838
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:57,941
I just think it's way too specific.

839
01:20:03,628 --> 01:20:04,309
Any other thoughts?

840
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:20,271
Yeah, and just to, I understand what Eunice is saying too, and to Jean's point, you know, the path of this document is going right through the desks of the city council.

841
01:20:20,331 --> 01:20:27,154
So you gotta realize that, you know, being this specifical, just realistically doesn't fly.

842
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:31,636
You just have to let them, we have to give them the ability to do their job.

843
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:37,479
The recall is our only recourse to correct that.

844
01:20:40,806 --> 01:20:42,988
Thank you.

845
01:20:43,048 --> 01:20:43,689
I was muted.

846
01:20:43,749 --> 01:20:45,250
I couldn't get I couldn't know it.

847
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:46,151
So I was doing this.

848
01:20:46,171 --> 01:20:46,531
Sorry.

849
01:20:47,633 --> 01:20:54,720
You know, I understand that the frustration and I get all that but I'm of the mind also to that.

850
01:20:55,240 --> 01:21:01,527
These are councils and committees that with elected people on and they

851
01:21:02,845 --> 01:21:06,114
You know, they set their own agenda and their own rules.

852
01:21:06,334 --> 01:21:11,507
I think that if we start tying this to this charter, I think they're overstepping.

853
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,521
That's my humble opinion on it.

854
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:15,861
I don't know who said it.

855
01:21:16,641 --> 01:21:20,662
I think these are professional people, the time and that.

856
01:21:20,822 --> 01:21:22,663
And yes, of course, I agree with you, Eunice.

857
01:21:22,723 --> 01:21:25,764
It would be optimal to have it at a time that was best for the community.

858
01:21:26,264 --> 01:21:34,626
But the other point is, too, is that these are people that have to meet and they have to set the time where they can also meet, too, within a certain set time frame.

859
01:21:35,546 --> 01:21:38,927
As for rules governing their own assemblies and their own gatherings,

860
01:21:39,396 --> 01:21:40,377
I think that's theirs.

861
01:21:40,577 --> 01:21:50,243
I think we really are getting into a territory where we're overstepping the parameters of what I see is our role in this.

862
01:21:51,704 --> 01:21:52,444
Thank you, Phyllis.

863
01:21:53,105 --> 01:21:53,485
Maury.

864
01:21:54,926 --> 01:21:57,127
Yeah, I understand the frustration.

865
01:21:57,427 --> 01:22:02,371
I'm one of those citizens of the community that's frustrated with the time going.

866
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:03,511
I mean, it's been...

867
01:22:05,177 --> 01:22:15,760
weekly meetings from as long as I can remember, and to have meetings go on until 11, 30, 12, 1 o'clock in the morning, whenever they do it.

868
01:22:16,721 --> 01:22:29,144
And it's on a regular basis, it seems, that it's kind of unfair to the public to hang around at a 7 o'clock meeting and not have stuff come onto the floor until 11 or 12 o'clock.

869
01:22:32,425 --> 01:22:41,908
if they have people who are interested in things going on and they're waiting five and six hours, maybe they do have to have some restraints put on them.

870
01:22:43,668 --> 01:22:58,973
I'm not saying here dictate fully, but to me, the way it's been manipulated these days that they're putting everything into two weeks, yet they want to get paid for a whole year.

871
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:06,349
How come their salary isn't prorated for their meetings?

872
01:23:07,529 --> 01:23:09,670
Are you saying that they're only going to meet for two weeks?

873
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,510
They meet every other week.

874
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:13,211
That's what they do.

875
01:23:13,591 --> 01:23:17,052
You said they're going to meet for two weeks and want to get paid for the whole year.

876
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:18,032
I thought that's what I heard.

877
01:23:18,292 --> 01:23:19,773
They want to get paid the whole year.

878
01:23:19,813 --> 01:23:24,754
They're on a 52-week salary, but they're only meeting 26 times a year, if that.

879
01:23:28,065 --> 01:23:30,707
Not even that because they only meet twice during the summer.

880
01:23:31,647 --> 01:23:32,127
Exactly.

881
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:35,889
That's not in accounting committees.

882
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,510
I understand that.

883
01:23:37,771 --> 01:23:48,276
I'm just saying there's a lot of frustration in the community with the different changes that this council has adopted over the last few years.

884
01:23:49,497 --> 01:23:55,881
You've seen the frustration with people with different agenda items that have come up that they're waiting,

885
01:23:56,381 --> 01:23:59,963
to hear four or five, six hours into the meeting before anything comes up.

886
01:24:00,623 --> 01:24:03,084
And maybe it's- I agree, Mark.

887
01:24:03,144 --> 01:24:05,465
I had to leave a meeting because it went on so long.

888
01:24:05,545 --> 01:24:07,526
Maybe it's something that we should look like.

889
01:24:07,726 --> 01:24:22,934
And I said earlier, we don't want to micromanage them, but also they have a responsibility to the community to treat the constituency with some kind of proper protocol.

890
01:24:23,654 --> 01:24:25,115
And that's what I have to say about that.

891
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:37,215
Can we, can I ask Anthony Wilson or Marilyn if what your thoughts are on this or there's.

892
01:24:39,662 --> 01:24:56,330
would say generally communities don't there isn't a lot of specificity here some of what I can see on the screen really aligns with what is in most communities fixed by the you know fixed by ordinance fixed by council rules

893
01:24:59,001 --> 01:25:06,647
You know, I guess in theory you could add more if you wanted to, but, you know, councils could go have long meetings for a number of reasons.

894
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:11,711
Budgets usually can be long meetings, you know, that meeting where they have the budget.

895
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:19,017
So there's the ideal, there's the realities of governing.

896
01:25:19,277 --> 01:25:26,263
And so I guess, you know, to say they can only have, if I understand the tenor of the conversation, to say they can only have two hour meetings or what have you,

897
01:25:29,308 --> 01:25:33,090
you may not be setting it up to be really the most efficient document.

898
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:47,237
I sort of tend to, would tend to say like, you know, the council will create its rules and it will, you know, it should be required to meet regularly at a certain time that would be,

899
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:51,627
the notice would be given to the public ahead of time.

900
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:55,529
They can expect meetings, you know, twice a month, so on and so forth.

901
01:25:55,589 --> 01:26:06,315
But generally, there isn't a lot of specificity or regulation applied to parameters around those types of rules.

902
01:26:06,976 --> 01:26:13,579
What about the suggestion of a meeting saying that the city council shall meet, well, weekly?

903
01:26:13,599 --> 01:26:15,760
I mean, you'd have to give them a vacation.

904
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,421
You can't just say weekly, I guess.

905
01:26:18,964 --> 01:26:21,929
I don't, I mean, because I feel that's one of the things that I heard.

906
01:26:23,733 --> 01:26:31,066
Well, I mean, they prior to, you know, 18 months or so ago, they met.

907
01:26:32,539 --> 01:26:40,142
Pretty much weekly from probably the 2nd or 3rd week of September to the end of June.

908
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:43,524
And I think that they always took the.

909
01:26:44,244 --> 01:26:47,846
The December holiday week off.

910
01:26:48,446 --> 01:26:48,566
And.

911
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:53,951
Because that's the schedule they set.

912
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:54,792
Right.

913
01:26:55,152 --> 01:26:57,673
Well, and that's the schedule that had been in place.

914
01:26:58,013 --> 01:26:58,313
Right.

915
01:26:58,573 --> 01:26:59,714
The beginning of time.

916
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:00,875
But it was set.

917
01:27:01,095 --> 01:27:02,335
Well, I don't know about that.

918
01:27:02,816 --> 01:27:05,757
I don't know how long it's been set, but it's been set for a long time.

919
01:27:06,277 --> 01:27:08,579
And Maury's been watching them a whole lot longer than that.

920
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:09,939
Right.

921
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:12,100
So I guess a long, long time.

922
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:20,705
What I'm asking Anthony and Marilyn is, is that a level of specificity that, you know, is,

923
01:27:22,475 --> 01:27:23,216
to say weekly.

924
01:27:23,236 --> 01:27:24,977
I'm not aware.

925
01:27:27,739 --> 01:27:29,380
I think it is too specific.

926
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:29,760
Yeah.

927
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:37,866
And that section of charter gives the council the authority to make rules.

928
01:27:38,106 --> 01:27:48,573
If you want to say something to the extent that, you know, the council should keep in mind the convenience of the public when setting their schedule.

929
01:27:49,117 --> 01:27:54,341
It, you know, begins to get the point across without a whole lot of verbiage.

930
01:27:56,743 --> 01:27:57,103
Okay.

931
01:27:57,824 --> 01:27:58,264
Thank you.

932
01:28:00,386 --> 01:28:00,646
Okay.

933
01:28:00,666 --> 01:28:02,407
So we've heard discussion on this.

934
01:28:05,109 --> 01:28:07,251
Right now, the language is what it is.

935
01:28:08,312 --> 01:28:11,955
Do people feel, do people want to make any other suggestions or?

936
01:28:16,604 --> 01:28:20,168
Clearly there's no appetite for changing much of anything.

937
01:28:20,589 --> 01:28:33,145
And the way things stand now, the council is going to do things the way in which they choose to.

938
01:28:33,823 --> 01:28:43,505
which isn't necessarily in the best interest of the community and the frustration that's out there now, that Maury was alluding to.

939
01:28:45,565 --> 01:29:01,328
I think what I was trying to do, and perhaps I can't put words in Maury's mouth, you can speak for yourself, Maury, but I was trying to put things in there that would reduce some of the simmering frustration that's in the community.

940
01:29:02,787 --> 01:29:06,610
Evidently, that's not what the charter can do.

941
01:29:13,234 --> 01:29:21,319
I'm not sure of the mechanism that we can put in here regarding how to control their actions and what they're doing.

942
01:29:21,479 --> 01:29:23,020
Is there any way that on

943
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:37,703
their adoption of their rules and regulations requiring public meetings and so forth, that they're required to do a certain thing.

944
01:29:37,983 --> 01:29:55,148
And I'm not quite sure how to say this, but I hear what Eunice is saying, and I hear throughout this city, day in, day out, regarding the way the city council is handling things at this present time for the city.

945
01:29:56,234 --> 01:30:03,659
You know, people aren't happy with the changes, that their voice isn't being heard any longer.

946
01:30:03,919 --> 01:30:23,932
And, you know, there's certain things that I would think that we're not gonna get involved with, but I think on a regular basis of meetings that maybe they, I think their feet should be held to the fire a little bit more than what it's being, than presently constituted right now, the way they're operating.

947
01:30:24,793 --> 01:30:33,319
And that's all I mean is I don't know what the mechanism is or the wording or the languages to make them more accountable to the public.

948
01:30:35,061 --> 01:30:38,023
I don't know if anybody has any thoughts or anything like that.

949
01:30:39,164 --> 01:30:40,705
Can I have my hand raised?

950
01:30:41,365 --> 01:30:41,926
Go ahead, Anton.

951
01:30:43,507 --> 01:30:50,352
I'd just like to add, I appreciate everybody's comments around the city council and

952
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:57,136
and the frustration that some members of our community feel.

953
01:30:59,697 --> 01:31:03,319
Right now we're expressing our own views.

954
01:31:03,640 --> 01:31:06,141
I mean, I can't speak for the whole community.

955
01:31:07,722 --> 01:31:10,984
I've seen all the Facebook stuff.

956
01:31:11,084 --> 01:31:13,686
I've sat in on the last couple of

957
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:20,907
City Council meetings on Zoom, something I don't usually do, and they're out of the norm.

958
01:31:21,968 --> 01:31:32,559
There's something going on right now, and I don't know how long it will last, but it will somehow resolve itself, even if it is through the next election.

959
01:31:33,357 --> 01:31:35,639
uh, you know, things will change.

960
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:46,129
I don't think it's our responsibility as a, as a child review commission to, uh, to kind of police and try to control the city council.

961
01:31:46,289 --> 01:31:47,710
They were elected by the people.

962
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:49,072
They got the votes.

963
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:54,737
They have, uh, they have a responsibility to the people that elected them.

964
01:31:55,437 --> 01:31:58,200
And, uh, it's not our job to kind of

965
01:31:59,008 --> 01:32:03,294
regulate their position.

966
01:32:04,375 --> 01:32:13,607
You know, if they want to meet once a month, you know, if that's, you know, their decision and they have the votes to back it up.

967
01:32:15,149 --> 01:32:17,132
So that's the way it is.

968
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:32,897
and for us to try to kind of reach, you know, that part of that government is way out of our purview, our ballpark.

969
01:32:34,798 --> 01:32:46,243
We really just can, you know, and somehow if there's a way to kind of voice it in the charter that the city council shall kind of,

970
01:32:47,507 --> 01:33:00,973
ask the public for, you know, you know, or, you know, seek recommendations on things, but we can't control them.

971
01:33:01,913 --> 01:33:02,894
It's not our job.

972
01:33:03,234 --> 01:33:15,119
And right now, there are some vocal people who have, you know, problems with the city council, maybe justly so, maybe not so justly so, you know, that's politics.

973
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:23,192
We're, you know, we're not here to kind of help people decide their politics.

974
01:33:24,594 --> 01:33:25,996
And I guess that's all I want to say.

975
01:33:26,016 --> 01:33:26,898
Thank you.

976
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:30,363
Thank you, Anthony, Phyllis, and then Ron.

977
01:33:31,335 --> 01:33:38,716
I just wanted to ask, and this is a point of information for myself, people may already know this, to whom is the city council responsible to?

978
01:33:39,336 --> 01:33:43,917
Like who actually, are they responsible to anyone?

979
01:33:44,777 --> 01:33:47,238
Is there someone that oversees the city council?

980
01:33:48,598 --> 01:33:50,778
No, I mean, they're elected, so.

981
01:33:51,178 --> 01:33:52,499
Yes, I know they're elected.

982
01:33:54,799 --> 01:33:56,619
They don't have the boss that I'm aware of.

983
01:33:57,739 --> 01:34:00,660
Can you ask someone at the Collins Center if they have any information on that?

984
01:34:01,907 --> 01:34:07,010
So that they're responsible to the voters.

985
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:07,970
Right.

986
01:34:08,091 --> 01:34:08,971
I understand that.

987
01:34:09,171 --> 01:34:09,691
I get that.

988
01:34:10,172 --> 01:34:15,395
And this is just something I know this has nothing to do with this, but this is just a point of clarification myself.

989
01:34:15,795 --> 01:34:21,418
So once they're elected, the understanding is then that they can conduct themselves

990
01:34:25,113 --> 01:34:32,738
what we hope in a manner befitting to the reason that they were elected because people voted for them who think that they're gonna do the best job for this position.

991
01:34:34,439 --> 01:34:38,321
So there's no accountability whatsoever.

992
01:34:38,341 --> 01:34:43,404
I think I understand where you're trying to go.

993
01:34:43,424 --> 01:34:44,685
I wouldn't phrase it like that.

994
01:34:44,725 --> 01:34:48,987
They'd be accountable to the ballot ultimately every two years.

995
01:34:49,027 --> 01:34:50,989
So I wouldn't say that they're not accountable.

996
01:34:51,789 --> 01:34:53,230
It would be through the electoral process.

997
01:34:53,878 --> 01:34:55,299
Right, I understand that, Anthony.

998
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:01,904
But I'm saying in the meantime, in the two years, there's no sense of accountability.

999
01:35:01,945 --> 01:35:06,929
Like the mayor couldn't say, OK, you've overstepped, or something like this couldn't happen.

1000
01:35:09,551 --> 01:35:09,811
No.

1001
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:14,575
I mean, unless if we get a recall provision into the charter, then

1002
01:35:16,453 --> 01:35:22,235
Yeah, honestly, I appreciate the couple of minutes here because I just needed to clear that up in my own head.

1003
01:35:22,775 --> 01:35:25,416
I'm not going to make a point for the charter or against the charter.

1004
01:35:25,436 --> 01:35:26,557
That's not my point here.

1005
01:35:27,117 --> 01:35:27,837
Thank you.

1006
01:35:27,957 --> 01:35:36,020
As long as they're, you know, acting within, you know, federal and state law, they can conduct themselves

1007
01:35:37,445 --> 01:35:40,649
In any which way they want is my understanding.

1008
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:45,874
And if they have for the past 50 years, this isn't new.

1009
01:35:46,194 --> 01:35:54,123
We've had, you know, we've had people who've had issues with the city council as long as I can remember from when I was a child.

1010
01:35:54,696 --> 01:36:04,006
that there's been outrage and a certain group hates this council or these councillors.

1011
01:36:04,367 --> 01:36:05,368
This isn't new.

1012
01:36:05,528 --> 01:36:08,492
This isn't something that we need to get involved in.

1013
01:36:08,652 --> 01:36:12,316
It will ultimately resolve itself.

1014
01:36:12,756 --> 01:36:14,498
The people who are

1015
01:36:16,787 --> 01:36:29,777
are able to get elected or the people who are, you know, can get the votes, that can get the support, that has the backing of the people.

1016
01:36:30,358 --> 01:36:34,241
You know, let the ballot decide.

1017
01:36:34,661 --> 01:36:41,707
I mean, if, I'm sorry, I'll start rambling.

1018
01:36:41,887 --> 01:36:42,968
I better shut up.

1019
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:43,868
Thank you, Anthony.

1020
01:36:44,189 --> 01:36:44,429
Ron.

1021
01:36:45,813 --> 01:36:47,735
Yeah, a few points.

1022
01:36:48,375 --> 01:36:56,122
First to Eunice, if you mandated that this council meet every day, it doesn't make them a better council.

1023
01:36:56,703 --> 01:36:58,645
So there's two different things.

1024
01:36:58,685 --> 01:37:04,070
I mean, if they met once a month, they could be more effective than one that meets every day.

1025
01:37:05,189 --> 01:37:13,617
I think that we must hold on to the recall, because it's really the people's only way of really combating abuse.

1026
01:37:14,298 --> 01:37:23,567
I'm also, hopefully, before the meeting ends, I'm going to introduce what I think is a very important piece, which is public participation, which happens to be hitting the city.

1027
01:37:24,428 --> 01:37:25,529
I'm not asking to

1028
01:37:26,870 --> 01:37:33,955
mandate how the city council works, but we, the public, are also a branch of this government.

1029
01:37:34,396 --> 01:37:48,086
And so I'm hoping that, you know, I know it wasn't on the agenda, but I'm hoping that we can establish some rules of either a subcommittee to get a real handle on the controversy going on with public participation.

1030
01:37:48,932 --> 01:37:51,473
So, you know, I think we have recall.

1031
01:37:51,493 --> 01:37:52,334
I agree with Anthony.

1032
01:37:52,374 --> 01:37:53,374
I think we have the vote.

1033
01:37:54,595 --> 01:38:01,879
But, you know, I'm just not, there's just, the micromanaging the situations is not necessarily gonna give you better government, I guess is my point.

1034
01:38:02,019 --> 01:38:15,867
However, I do think the people need some power to not have to put up with four years of a mayor, two years of a city council, or two years of a school committee, if the people as a group are disappointed.

1035
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:18,825
Okay, thank you.

1036
01:38:19,506 --> 01:38:44,814
So we've discussed this, and we can talk about finding ways to add language, something along the lines of what Marilyn suggested, but specific requirements maybe are not

1037
01:38:45,307 --> 01:38:45,927
advisable.

1038
01:38:46,167 --> 01:38:49,088
So do we, are we okay with this?

1039
01:38:49,208 --> 01:39:07,694
And maybe we can decide to look at some sort of general language that we would, you know, that would sort of reflect the point of view that we would like the city council to take when they set their rules and their meeting times.

1040
01:39:09,935 --> 01:39:13,716
But beyond, does any, is there anything else that we want to cover beyond that?

1041
01:39:15,926 --> 01:39:18,127
I don't think that anything that we put in here is.

1042
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:31,816
Necessarily going to have, you know, as mere suggestions or recommendations for how we want things to be conducted.

1043
01:39:31,836 --> 01:39:39,621
In terms of the frustration that's boiling over in the city right now.

1044
01:39:40,462 --> 01:39:40,822
With the.

1045
01:39:42,754 --> 01:39:57,138
elected officials as currently constituted, if it stays that way, in the future, I don't think that there's anything that we can put in here that would be a mere suggestion or recommendation would have any sort of effect.

1046
01:39:58,418 --> 01:40:05,780
We can put language in saying, you know, we recommend that you do things based on the convenience of the community.

1047
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:10,962
You know, it's not an order, so they can

1048
01:40:12,316 --> 01:40:16,801
take that whichever way they want, which is probably to say that they won't take it at all.

1049
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:29,393
Um, I would be more interested in pursuing what Ron is proposing, um, with some sort of a subcommittee or something.

1050
01:40:29,413 --> 01:40:36,020
I'm not quite sure what he has in mind that might have more of an effect on how we can

1051
01:40:38,126 --> 01:40:44,091
If we can't put it in here, as it is, perhaps is a different place that we can do things.

1052
01:40:44,791 --> 01:40:46,312
You mean a different place in the charter?

1053
01:40:47,293 --> 01:40:48,834
I'm not quite sure what Ron's proposing.

1054
01:40:48,854 --> 01:40:53,318
So I'd certainly like to hear him out in some fashion at the appropriate time.

1055
01:40:53,378 --> 01:40:54,819
I know we want to get through this piece.

1056
01:40:55,359 --> 01:41:02,164
Well, I mean, rules for public participation, I think would go under rules of procedure.

1057
01:41:02,284 --> 01:41:06,808
So I think we're sort of in that.

1058
01:41:07,396 --> 01:41:14,360
Point right now, I mean, I brought up public participation, you know, to some extent, you know, in the.

1059
01:41:15,781 --> 01:41:21,945
You know, blurb that I wrote on the side there, you know, with all meetings should be required to have a period for public.

1060
01:41:22,725 --> 01:41:27,768
Comment within the 1st priority so that everybody has sufficient opportunity to speak.

1061
01:41:30,562 --> 01:41:37,546
You know, which, so I mean, I, I think that there are some state laws surrounding that.

1062
01:41:37,606 --> 01:41:48,052
So maybe Marilyn and or Anthony Wilson can talk about that to a public participation and whether it's reflected in state law or.

1063
01:41:50,753 --> 01:41:53,534
The open meeting law does provide provisions.

1064
01:41:53,895 --> 01:41:59,417
It does not require public comment under the open meeting law if you read the law in the guide.

1065
01:42:00,538 --> 01:42:06,621
So, you know, you definitely could put some language in there.

1066
01:42:07,241 --> 01:42:12,163
It's not impermissible to add language around public comment.

1067
01:42:13,044 --> 01:42:14,785
I guess my only suggestion here is

1068
01:42:17,323 --> 01:42:20,947
What I guess to be to be to be, I guess, somewhat careful because.

1069
01:42:23,145 --> 01:42:31,311
depending on the issue, it's an issue sort of that I've actually seen play out where something controversial has come on the agenda.

1070
01:42:34,213 --> 01:42:38,257
The charter has, or at least the interpretation is that the charter requires public comment.

1071
01:42:39,417 --> 01:42:48,324
And so you can spend an entire meeting in public comment and not get to the urgent business that's to be voted on and then have to have,

1072
01:42:49,505 --> 01:43:13,145
another meeting and then and then there'd be a sort of a tug and pull about how much public comment to allow at that next meeting um so i think it's something that should not prohibit from from regulating here in the charter um but to be sort of sort of mindful of the impact it could have on the efficiency of meetings okay thank you um when you say it's it's um

1073
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:20,802
something that could be in the charter, can you maybe be a little more specific about what type of language would be expected or typical?

1074
01:43:28,265 --> 01:43:32,428
I'm not aware of any typical language around, particularly in this section.

1075
01:43:32,808 --> 01:43:43,455
There is language in the, there's a citizens, I forget the exact section number it is, but there's a section about sort of citizen participation in the model charter that I believe that we sent you.

1076
01:43:43,775 --> 01:43:48,938
It's got a couple of different mechanisms, the referendum vote, the initiative petition.

1077
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:54,682
I've recently seen some language around

1078
01:43:57,104 --> 01:44:12,632
the population being able to request like a town hall meeting here's you know I don't know if this will you know how this will land but I think if you would put some language here about that when the council adopts its rules to to

1079
01:44:13,753 --> 01:44:40,672
includes language for reasonable, a reasonable period for citizens to be heard at a given council meeting, thereby not sort of requiring a certain time period or certain, that allows the council flexibility and its rules to say, public comment shall be, you know, X amount of time long, commenters will have X time to speak, that way they can adjust, you know, if they have 100 speakers, two minutes per speaker versus they have 10, they might allow more time or less depending on the circumstances.

1080
01:44:43,365 --> 01:44:44,986
Okay, thank you.

1081
01:44:46,086 --> 01:44:46,466
Thoughts?

1082
01:44:56,791 --> 01:44:57,051
Ron.

1083
01:44:58,211 --> 01:44:59,132
I guess I'll speak again.

1084
01:45:00,372 --> 01:45:10,757
Again, my point is that, you know, I think there needs to be a mechanism in our charter that defines what public participation is across the board.

1085
01:45:13,242 --> 01:45:16,003
Five years ago, it was 10 minutes a person.

1086
01:45:16,463 --> 01:45:19,844
Two years ago, it went to five, and on Tuesday, it went to three.

1087
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:31,628
I agree with what Anthony said about regulating and based on who's there and what's there, but I think a minimum of, actually, I don't, I'm not gonna say what my thoughts are.

1088
01:45:31,688 --> 01:45:39,371
I think I like to keep it open, but I think I would like to see a subcommittee do the kind of research we've done on every other issue here.

1089
01:45:40,272 --> 01:45:42,253
We know how to put a survey out in public.

1090
01:45:43,113 --> 01:45:44,074
We know how to do that.

1091
01:45:45,134 --> 01:45:54,758
To get some information and feedback because people are not happy with the ability to, I've experienced, I'm sure everybody else has experienced it.

1092
01:45:55,579 --> 01:46:00,841
I think that my opinion is that this charter is the people's document.

1093
01:46:01,848 --> 01:46:04,869
And I think that the people represent a part of this government.

1094
01:46:05,469 --> 01:46:12,491
And I think there should be rules regulated because right now, as of Tuesday, we're at three minutes and 90 minutes total.

1095
01:46:14,351 --> 01:46:19,112
In two years, when we vote again, we can go down to one minute and 60 seconds.

1096
01:46:19,233 --> 01:46:24,174
So I'm trying to figure out what the right number is to put it in the charter.

1097
01:46:24,234 --> 01:46:28,235
So it's not something that on a whim you can do because you don't like what the people are saying or

1098
01:46:29,475 --> 01:46:30,296
for whatever reason.

1099
01:46:30,436 --> 01:46:44,761
So that's, I'm asking that we formulate a, it doesn't have to be a long, you know, we're talking about one issue, but a public participation subcommittee that will do the research to bring back that says, hey, the people like it this way.

1100
01:46:45,222 --> 01:46:47,062
This is what people are saying to us.

1101
01:46:47,783 --> 01:46:50,984
And I strongly feel like it should be part of our charter.

1102
01:46:53,323 --> 01:47:13,335
I agree fully with what Ron's saying, and I want to bring it just a step further, and not just focus on public participation, because as Ron hit it right on the head, it's also the people's document on how the government is to be held.

1103
01:47:14,455 --> 01:47:20,458
I think we should maybe bring up a couple of these topics that we brought up tonight on frequency of meetings.

1104
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:31,004
I'm not saying, maybe Anthony misunderstood, I'm not saying that the meeting should only be two hours, which Anthony brought up.

1105
01:47:31,624 --> 01:47:37,227
I'm saying that they shouldn't start a meeting at seven and have

1106
01:47:39,077 --> 01:47:44,062
the public there and their gender items are not coming up until 11 or 11 30.

1107
01:47:45,804 --> 01:47:55,073
I can go back, I think it was either four or six years ago when they brought up something and they tabled it and they took it off the table after all the

1108
01:47:56,755 --> 01:48:02,936
all the citizens left at 11 30 at night and voted on it to pass it when everyone was down there against it.

1109
01:48:03,096 --> 01:48:22,700
So I think that maybe, and I think, and I'm going to agree with Ron, I think there's a few items here that maybe we should do in a subcommittee again, and relatively quick, because we're trying to move through this thing and not let this thing sit on the front of the month, but put together a subcommittee and let's hash this out.

1110
01:48:23,881 --> 01:48:24,201
And, uh,

1111
01:48:25,347 --> 01:48:30,010
bring some other suggestions maybe forward on rules and regulations.

1112
01:48:31,491 --> 01:48:41,456
So I guess my, I mean, we've, we've been talking in this meeting about sort of the general advisability of not getting specific in the charter.

1113
01:48:42,057 --> 01:48:50,862
So, and I, what I'm hearing is, um, um, a sub, a subcommittee to sort of come up with recommendations for specific,

1114
01:48:52,252 --> 01:49:00,615
rules about a time limit for public participation and, you know, number of meetings and things like that.

1115
01:49:00,655 --> 01:49:12,338
So I just want to... No, I don't think it's so specific as much as it is that it should be protocol that the public has a right and they're not regulated as wants and they just went from two to three minutes.

1116
01:49:13,539 --> 01:49:16,720
You know, no one should be up there for 20 minutes either.

1117
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:17,840
You know, just

1118
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:33,405
but to put a guillotine over someone's head to say, okay, you got three minutes, and after three minutes, they turn your microphone off, I'm not entirely sure that that's proper protocol on how city government should be run.

1119
01:49:37,226 --> 01:49:37,827
Gene.

1120
01:49:40,307 --> 01:49:46,630
I guess I'm just going to say I think city council should have the,

1121
01:49:48,387 --> 01:49:55,432
ability to run a reasonable meeting in the time frames they have.

1122
01:49:55,712 --> 01:49:58,274
I totally support public participation.

1123
01:49:58,994 --> 01:50:11,043
There's multiple ways of providing input to city council, including written testimony, speaking at a meeting, coming to subcommittee meetings.

1124
01:50:12,584 --> 01:50:17,107
And there is some case law, and there's an ACLU opinion on this,

1125
01:50:19,408 --> 01:50:20,849
that I looked up and found.

1126
01:50:20,869 --> 01:50:40,066
So I think there is some recognition that public needs to have the ability to participate in city council meetings, but also city council has the authority to place some limits on that so they can get like, I think what Anthony Wilson was saying is, so they can get the work done.

1127
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:46,173
So I'm not exactly sure what the subcommittee would do or how it would address that.

1128
01:50:48,255 --> 01:50:51,297
But if people are interested in that ACLU opinion, I can share it with them.

1129
01:50:53,199 --> 01:50:53,639
Thank you.

1130
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:54,460
Eunice.

1131
01:50:55,921 --> 01:51:08,892
Totally agree with Ron and even more so with Maury, where I think we need to take things a step further as I continue to reiterate, if it's not in the charter, then

1132
01:51:11,059 --> 01:51:21,923
you know, this council or perhaps future councils will do things that are at their will and convenience rather than that of the community.

1133
01:51:22,003 --> 01:51:25,345
So I'm volunteering to serve on that committee.

1134
01:51:26,365 --> 01:51:29,967
So, um, be the, I put it together.

1135
01:51:30,187 --> 01:51:35,989
So I just want to get a little more clarity on, cause the different things have been suggested for this subcommittee.

1136
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:38,270
Um,

1137
01:51:39,216 --> 01:51:44,539
So Ron initially just suggested it to look into the issue of public participation.

1138
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:55,924
And I guess I'm not, I mean, we have a lot we have, we have, we have a lot to do before we finish this.

1139
01:51:55,944 --> 01:51:59,866
And I guess I'm not entirely convinced we would need a subcommittee.

1140
01:51:59,886 --> 01:52:02,447
I mean, I think we could continue to discuss it further.

1141
01:52:02,467 --> 01:52:02,527
But

1142
01:52:08,345 --> 01:52:12,627
I don't personally see the need for a subcommittee.

1143
01:52:15,048 --> 01:52:15,989
Can I say something?

1144
01:52:16,489 --> 01:52:17,209
Yes, Anthony.

1145
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:23,212
I understand Ron and Eunice and Maury.

1146
01:52:23,272 --> 01:52:27,794
You're hearing a lot from the community, and people are frustrated.

1147
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:35,417
But I'd just like you to understand one thing, that the people that you're hearing from,

1148
01:52:37,225 --> 01:52:43,148
are a small, well, maybe they're not, they don't represent the entire city.

1149
01:52:43,628 --> 01:52:51,512
And when we're looking at the charter, we have to look at it through the lens of the whole community.

1150
01:52:51,972 --> 01:53:03,598
And I know some of the older, more conservative folks are very upset with the current city council, but that's just the way it is.

1151
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:06,700
We can't,

1152
01:53:08,653 --> 01:53:14,698
I'm sorry, we can't, we can't, we can't change that in the charter.

1153
01:53:16,900 --> 01:53:23,506
I just, I just, you know, you know, the future is, is in front of us.

1154
01:53:23,546 --> 01:53:25,708
You know, we do things differently now.

1155
01:53:25,728 --> 01:53:33,175
You know, we have people on zoom and meetings and people participate on zoom from the comfort of their home, you know, like,

1156
01:53:34,997 --> 01:53:43,982
And, you know, people can email and communicate a lot of ways with their city councilors, and they do.

1157
01:53:44,582 --> 01:53:53,686
They get a lot of calls and a lot of, you know, they interact with their constituents, and I don't know why we

1158
01:53:55,657 --> 01:54:03,700
We, as a group, think that we can somehow, you know, kind of make those kind of changes.

1159
01:54:05,121 --> 01:54:05,461
Why?

1160
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:11,703
We're not over the, you know, the city council.

1161
01:54:12,103 --> 01:54:13,384
I like Chilis' question.

1162
01:54:13,464 --> 01:54:15,744
I mean, they are the elected officials.

1163
01:54:16,065 --> 01:54:17,985
We have to let them do their job.

1164
01:54:19,126 --> 01:54:19,586
We have

1165
01:54:20,775 --> 01:54:25,677
A charter isn't supposed to constrain them from governing.

1166
01:54:25,717 --> 01:54:31,499
It's supposed to just give them the framework.

1167
01:54:32,359 --> 01:54:38,421
And if you want to go into those weeds, go ahead.

1168
01:54:39,501 --> 01:54:43,402
I really believe nothing good can come of it.

1169
01:54:44,243 --> 01:54:45,283
That's just my opinion.

1170
01:54:46,163 --> 01:54:47,604
Okay, thank you, Anthony.

1171
01:54:48,224 --> 01:54:50,206
I know we have Ron and Eunice that want to speak.

1172
01:54:50,326 --> 01:54:56,069
We have four minutes left, and I want to have time to see if there's anyone from the public that wants to speak.

1173
01:54:57,290 --> 01:55:03,014
So, and I know we didn't get through very much of our agenda, unfortunately, but I think we had productive discussion.

1174
01:55:03,034 --> 01:55:06,716
Ron, do you want to quickly say what you were going to say?

1175
01:55:07,262 --> 01:55:19,105
Yeah, just quickly, I'm kind of surprised at Anthony's comments because that's all we've done here for 15 months is make decisions on ward representation and things that, you know, we try to listen to the people.

1176
01:55:19,785 --> 01:55:23,406
I haven't said how I want the participation to go.

1177
01:55:23,526 --> 01:55:32,228
All I asked is that a subcommittee be formed to understand what the length of time each citizen should have based on the information we gather from other cities

1178
01:55:32,668 --> 01:55:33,948
and from a quick survey.

1179
01:55:34,008 --> 01:55:43,230
So, you know, when you say we are the advisory board, that's gonna advise the city council and the mayor and the citizens.

1180
01:55:43,311 --> 01:55:47,431
So to say that we don't have power, we do have power, we have power to advise.

1181
01:55:47,491 --> 01:55:55,173
So I don't appreciate that, you know, we shouldn't do these things because it may, you know, hurt the precious city council.

1182
01:55:55,393 --> 01:55:56,194
That's my comment.

1183
01:55:56,634 --> 01:55:58,034
Okay, thank you.

1184
01:55:58,354 --> 01:56:00,274
I like the opportunity to respond, Ron.

1185
01:56:00,394 --> 01:56:01,335
Okay.

1186
01:56:01,495 --> 01:56:02,415
In all due respect,

1187
01:56:04,265 --> 01:56:09,908
In all due respect, I find your response.

1188
01:56:15,650 --> 01:56:23,494
I'm sorry, I'm getting some interference, but what I said, I said because I want to see this.

1189
01:56:25,312 --> 01:56:47,997
this charter study committee succeed in putting a charter together that can be taken seriously by the city council, that they will accept and forward to the mayor, that it can be something that can benefit our community, bring it forward, not try

1190
01:56:48,943 --> 01:56:50,064
to regulate.

1191
01:56:50,124 --> 01:56:51,565
We're not here to regulate.

1192
01:56:51,925 --> 01:56:54,007
We're here to make recommendations.

1193
01:56:54,487 --> 01:56:56,389
We're not a regulatory board.

1194
01:56:56,409 --> 01:57:14,122
I think that we're getting off track if we think we have any type of power to change the behavior of elected officials through this

1195
01:57:15,147 --> 01:57:19,429
through this board, this commission, whatever you want to call it.

1196
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:29,953
Do what you feel that you need to do, but I'm telling you, you go into those weeds and we as a committee are not going to come out of it.

1197
01:57:31,134 --> 01:57:31,514
Thank you.

1198
01:57:32,170 --> 01:57:33,171
Okay, thanks, Anthony.

1199
01:57:33,631 --> 01:57:35,972
Eunice, 30 seconds.

1200
01:57:37,613 --> 01:57:42,375
We've all put a ton of time into this effort for the past however many months.

1201
01:57:42,475 --> 01:57:44,496
We've all served on multiple committees.

1202
01:57:45,316 --> 01:57:50,279
I think if you've got at least two, perhaps three, maybe a couple more,

1203
01:57:51,402 --> 01:58:01,285
you know, members willing to put the work in and serve on a committee to further investigate this issue, I think it's a worthy endeavor.

1204
01:58:02,386 --> 01:58:02,726
Okay.

1205
01:58:02,846 --> 01:58:13,310
I'm just unclear on exactly what the investigation would entail, so I would like to, we'll put it on the agenda for the next meeting, and we'll continue to discuss that.

1206
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:13,970
Phyllis?

1207
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:19,432
Oh, you can't unmute, sorry.

1208
01:58:20,272 --> 01:58:20,432
Here.

1209
01:58:21,277 --> 01:58:22,923
Okay, now you can unmute, I think.

1210
01:58:25,993 --> 01:58:26,213
Nope.

1211
01:58:26,961 --> 01:58:31,603
I just think, Melba and everyone, that this has been a long time.

1212
01:58:31,623 --> 01:58:39,467
I think that if two people want to put some points together, I'm of the opinion myself that we cannot regulate time in those things.

1213
01:58:40,027 --> 01:58:43,689
Whatever that avenue wants to be done, that's fine.

1214
01:58:44,069 --> 01:58:47,990
But I think that we've got to stop talking about this and move on to something else.

1215
01:58:48,050 --> 01:58:53,733
If someone wants to make a presentation and put the points on the paper, then we'll do that that way.

1216
01:58:54,891 --> 01:58:55,332
That's all.

1217
01:58:55,512 --> 01:58:56,393
I agree with that.

1218
01:58:57,314 --> 01:58:59,156
We'll put it on the agenda for the next meeting.

1219
01:58:59,236 --> 01:59:09,287
And in the meantime, if any individual member wants to gather information that they think would be helpful to the discussion, that would be fine.

1220
01:59:11,229 --> 01:59:11,569
Okay.

1221
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:14,673
I would like to see if any members of the public would like to speak.

1222
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:22,575
Okay, so it's 830.

1223
01:59:23,598 --> 01:59:26,705
And I have to end on time because I have something else at 830.

1224
01:59:26,766 --> 01:59:31,678
So thank you, everybody.

1225
01:59:33,723 --> 01:59:35,708
Motion to adjourn.

1226
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:36,851
All in favor.

1227
01:59:37,673 --> 01:59:37,794
Aye.

1228
01:59:38,175 --> 01:59:38,495
All right.

1229
01:59:38,716 --> 01:59:38,997
Thanks.

1230
01:59:39,037 --> 01:59:40,120
See you in a couple weeks.
