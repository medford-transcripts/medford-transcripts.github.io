[SPEAKER_06]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
[SPEAKER_06]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,433
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thank you all so much for joining me today.

10
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:51,515
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't mind just starting by introducing yourselves with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:55,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start.

12
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:57,797
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Steve Schnapp.

13
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:01,878
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Medford Square, near Medford Square.

14
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:04,859
[SPEAKER_00]: I live with my lifelong partner.

15
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,280
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm retired.

16
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:10,357
[SPEAKER_00]: originally from the Bronx, New York.

17
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,699
[SPEAKER_00]: I use he, him as my pronouns.

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,364
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say a little bit about myself so folks might know where I'm coming from.

19
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:29,448
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born into a secular Jewish family in the Bronx, working class.

20
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,611
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents were, we now call progressives.

21
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:43,694
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mom was instrumental in giving me a Hebrew name when I was born.

22
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:52,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in 1946, just after World War II ended, and she thought it important that I have the Hebrew name Shalom.

23
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:59,970
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Steve, Steven, but Shalom was my Hebrew name because it means peace.

24
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And she really thought that was important.

25
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:10,938
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say more about that as this conversation continues.

26
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:13,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Steve.

27
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:19,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I go next?

28
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:21,046
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

29
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:24,689
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Munir Germanus.

30
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,070
[SPEAKER_04]: He, him pronouns.

31
00:02:29,288 --> 00:02:33,611
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk a little bit about my background.

32
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:52,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been an elder at the Clarendon Hill Presbyterian Church in Sarnoval, where I served on this ruling session for approximately 30 years, although now I'm not an active member anymore of the church for many years.

33
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:58,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I was convinced to become a born-again Christian in my youth.

34
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:09,150
[SPEAKER_04]: growing up in Lebanon, but now occasionally refer to myself as a born-again pagan, especially after reading the book The Pagan Christ by Tom Harper.

35
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:21,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I was also a member of the Medford Human Rights Commission and served as chair for a few years, and I'm currently a board member of the Center for Arabic Culture.

36
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:28,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm also a member of the Mass Peace Action, Jewish Voice for Peace, and two

37
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:33,272
[SPEAKER_04]: local Medford groups, Safe Medford, and Medford People Power.

38
00:03:34,293 --> 00:03:41,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I was born in Jerusalem, Palestine in 1944, prior to the creation of the state of Israel.

39
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:54,508
[SPEAKER_04]: By training, I'm a physicist with a PhD in physics from Duft University, and I'm a naturalized US citizen who's been living in Medford for the past 40 years.

40
00:03:55,729 --> 00:03:57,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk later more about

41
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:04,296
[SPEAKER_04]: the situation, the country where I was born, and the region.

42
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:05,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

43
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:06,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

44
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:10,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am Barry Ingber.

45
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in North Medford.

46
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,940
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm he.

47
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:28,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I identify as a long-term peace and social justice activist, and this connects to my identification as a Jew, which is

48
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:33,409
[SPEAKER_03]: a group with a very long history of suffering, bigotry, and violence.

49
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:43,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also a practicing Jew, and I belong to a Jewish congregation, and I practice many of the traditional religious rituals.

50
00:04:45,473 --> 00:04:58,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also a member of Safe Medford, Medford People Power, Jewish Voice for Peace, and I'll leave it there.

51
00:04:58,927 --> 00:04:59,227
[SPEAKER_03]: for now.

52
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:01,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

53
00:05:01,429 --> 00:05:07,895
[SPEAKER_06]: And so today, I think we're hoping to have a little bit of a dialogue about the war in Gaza and its repercussions in Medford.

54
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:17,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we get into that, I wonder, you know, you all mentioned a little bit about your identities, if there's any part of your identity that you're sort of hoping to elevate for for today's conversation.

55
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:27,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mentioned my secular Jewish upbringing.

56
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,601
[SPEAKER_00]: That certainly has influenced me dramatically.

57
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:36,986
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent my life as a community organizer, community educator.

58
00:05:38,948 --> 00:05:42,672
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom used the Hebrew term tzedek, justice.

59
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:55,598
[SPEAKER_00]: telling me that it was one of the few words repeated in the Bible, the five books of Moses, because it was so important, that notion.

60
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,600
[SPEAKER_00]: I identify as a Jew.

61
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I also identify as a New Yorker, a Bronxite.

62
00:06:03,682 --> 00:06:08,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I identify as a husband, a grandfather, a father.

63
00:06:09,985 --> 00:06:12,986
[SPEAKER_00]: and as an activist now that I'm retired.

64
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:18,388
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all contributes to who I am, I think.

65
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:24,990
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's intersectional in a way, my identities.

66
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say that I identify as both

67
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:52,883
[SPEAKER_04]: a Lebanese and Palestinian American person, because most of my life, when I was younger, until I graduated from college, I spent in Lebanon.

68
00:06:53,824 --> 00:06:56,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And since then, I've been mostly living in the US.

69
00:06:58,107 --> 00:07:07,775
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was born into a Christian family, but participated in church activities.

70
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:22,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a younger person, and when I came, when I immigrated into this country, or when I first came here to graduate school, I was not part of any church activities.

71
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:35,041
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, when the graduate student advisor at Tufts asked me about my religious background,

72
00:07:37,755 --> 00:07:48,699
[SPEAKER_04]: used the term evangelical, that was a literal translation from Arabic, not knowing what evangelical meant.

73
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And her reaction was, oh, and I didn't quite understand it at that time.

74
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:58,383
[SPEAKER_04]: But now I am fully aware of what it implies and whatnot.

75
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,624
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll say more about that later.

76
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:22,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just throw in that Steve's reference to Tzedek in the Tanakh, in the five books of Moses, is that the full phrase is Tzedek, Tzedek tirdof, justice, justice shall you pursue.

77
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:28,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And the name of my congregation is Dorshed Tzedek, Pursuers of Justice.

78
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:31,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you all for that.

79
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:40,217
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's clear that you have been part of a social justice-focused, activist-focused community and communities for a long time.

80
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:47,141
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we're going to talk more about what's happening today in Gaza.

81
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:53,645
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm wondering if you might say just a word or two about what's kept you in this.

82
00:08:53,706 --> 00:08:57,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like it's been a long time, a lot of hard work that you've put into it.

83
00:08:57,988 --> 00:08:58,789
[SPEAKER_06]: What keeps you going?

84
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start this time.

85
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:09,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that unlike many Jews that I know, I have no connection to Israel.

86
00:09:09,846 --> 00:09:10,846
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't speak Hebrew.

87
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't speak Arabic.

88
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: I identify more with the Pale of Settlement in Eastern Europe.

89
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:27,535
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where my ancestors came from, far further back than I'm able to trace.

90
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:31,363
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no particular interest in the Middle East.

91
00:09:31,463 --> 00:09:47,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lot more interested in, have historically been more active in issues in Latin America, which I speak some Spanish and I've been there in various countries in Latin America and know more about the history there.

92
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:55,963
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of what happens in Israel and Palestine is done in my name as a Jew.

93
00:09:57,657 --> 00:10:00,859
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funded with U.S.

94
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:01,539
[SPEAKER_03]: resources.

95
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:09,803
[SPEAKER_03]: And as an American Jew, I don't feel like I have a choice but to be active in this issue.

96
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to be.

97
00:10:14,385 --> 00:10:16,986
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go next, again, add a few more words.

98
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:26,190
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, I've been active in Palestine-Israel issues

99
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:31,774
[SPEAKER_04]: for probably around 40 years.

100
00:10:34,114 --> 00:10:37,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been many times a frustrating experience.

101
00:10:39,115 --> 00:10:55,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I mentioned, I don't identify as a Palestinian or a Lebanese, and even though I grew up in that region, but I consider those labels, so to speak, to be artificial.

102
00:10:56,508 --> 00:11:20,500
[SPEAKER_04]: because it is something that the colonial powers of the UK and France, who pretty much divided the region as they felt they wanted to, just to control the people, and they created many times artificial borders between these places.

103
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,522
[SPEAKER_04]: And so even though historically there's been Palestine, historically there was Mount Lebanon,

104
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:32,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Historically, there's been Syria, but most of that region was actually called Greater Syria for many years.

105
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:40,047
[SPEAKER_04]: But I keep on going because I feel like I don't have a choice.

106
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:42,868
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.

107
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:48,150
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are two things that keep me going.

108
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,050
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep me going.

109
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you framed it right.

110
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,632
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the three of us have been at it for a long time.

111
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,527
[SPEAKER_00]: I am luckier than Munir.

112
00:11:59,268 --> 00:12:10,537
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, as I mentioned, I grew up in a very supportive family that encouraged me to be progressive and to be active.

113
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:15,201
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew up at a time when there were large movements happening.

114
00:12:15,942 --> 00:12:18,264
[SPEAKER_00]: The civil rights movement was big.

115
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:22,487
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was in college when the Vietnam War

116
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,914
[SPEAKER_00]: grew dramatically and the draft began.

117
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:31,560
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave up my deferment, my student deferment, and was drafted.

118
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:36,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been actually doing some draft counseling.

119
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:42,139
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew the ins and outs, how to make a decision whether to go into the army and try and organize.

120
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I was against the war.

121
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Or go to Canada or something like that.

122
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:51,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And I applied for a conscientious objector status.

123
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:53,342
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a delaying tactic.

124
00:12:54,743 --> 00:13:00,544
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was able, through some hard work and support of a lot of folks, actually get that status.

125
00:13:01,164 --> 00:13:03,265
[SPEAKER_00]: I was denied once, then they approved it.

126
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:06,872
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did two years of alternate duty in a children's hospital.

127
00:13:09,613 --> 00:13:16,194
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Vietnam was an atrocious war that lasted for many, many years.

128
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:22,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And it convinced me of that simple slogan that war is not the answer.

129
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:30,757
[SPEAKER_00]: That it doesn't achieve many objectives other than making a very, very few people very, very wealthy and powerful.

130
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:37,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the victims in war are civilian, one way or another.

131
00:13:38,314 --> 00:13:41,897
[SPEAKER_00]: They pay the price, women and children pay the price.

132
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:54,404
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sad and difficult to 50 years, 60 years later, at a time in my life when I'm retired to see

133
00:14:01,353 --> 00:14:13,455
[SPEAKER_00]: this nation's, my nation's resources being poured into conflicts around the world and the latest one in Gaza that has the greatest impact on civilians.

134
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:19,076
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to keep going, and that's a really good question.

135
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:23,677
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two things that keep me going are my children and grandchildren.

136
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three grandchildren.

137
00:14:25,017 --> 00:14:27,718
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a world that they're going to have to live in.

138
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:28,538
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be gone.

139
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,040
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll live here.

140
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:52,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's awful to think that that world will be one where war and violence is the accepted response to difficulties, to problems, first response often, and massive violence in this case.

141
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:57,100
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that keeps me going is folks like yourself, young people,

142
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:01,151
[SPEAKER_00]: who didn't have the kind of background necessarily that I did.

143
00:15:01,992 --> 00:15:06,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to become involved in stuff and well-supported when I got arrested and all sorts of things like that.

144
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:23,082
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see many young folks who are doing things like establishing podcasts and encouraging dialogue and doing many, many, many things that I guess I did or tried to do when I was that age.

145
00:15:23,823 --> 00:15:34,772
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing that there is a cohort of people who also think a better world is possible, that keeps me going.

146
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:37,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, guys.

147
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think we are going to talk a little bit of a summary of what's going on.

148
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we do that, I know, Munir, I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what it was like to live in this region when you were growing up.

149
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,126
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'll do that.

150
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:56,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give a little historical background as well, as brief as possible.

151
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:04,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important to remember that Muslims, Christians, Jews, Druze, and other religious minorities

152
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:22,739
[SPEAKER_04]: lived in harmony in what is known as the Middle East and in Palestine for many centuries prior to the British and French colonization of that region, except when instigated by the colonizing powers in the typical divide and conquer fashion.

153
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,584
[SPEAKER_04]: The situation in Palestine started to change dramatically near the beginning of the 20th century.

154
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:51,219
[SPEAKER_04]: mainly as a result of the discrimination against Jewish citizens in various countries in Europe, which eventually led to the horrific events of the Holocaust and the subsequent migration of European or some European Jews to Palestine, which at that time was a British colony.

155
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,363
[SPEAKER_04]: This ended in the forced expulsion of around 750,000 indigenous Palestinians

156
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:06,799
[SPEAKER_04]: when the British mandate ended and the state of Israel was created in 1948.

157
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:21,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I, myself, and my family are survivors of this ethnic cleansing of most of the indigenous Palestinian population because we were not of the right ethnicity.

158
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:24,351
[SPEAKER_04]: My family was Christian.

159
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:28,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, when my ancestors converted to Christianity,

160
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:34,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost our rights to our home and land according to Israeli law.

161
00:17:35,607 --> 00:17:57,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have a copy of the land where my father built our house, along with photos of the house in West Jerusalem that is occupied by a Jewish guy, a Jewish Israeli, I should say, that as this was obtained by a Jewish friend of ours from the Israeli Registry of Deeds a few years ago.

162
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:22,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, other historical landmarks in this conflict, and I'll just be very brief here, I'll touch upon the dates, was the 1967 war that ended with Israel occupying all of historic Palestine, because initially when Israel was created in 1948, it was created on a significant portion of Palestine, but not all of it.

163
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:36,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So the 67 war expanded Israeli control into the West Bank and into East Jerusalem that previously had been under Jordanian control.

164
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:47,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Israel also occupied the Syrian Golan Heights as well as the Gaza Strip that was under Egyptian rule.

165
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:50,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Israel eventually withdrew from Gaza in 2005

166
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:59,170
[SPEAKER_04]: At least they withdrew their forces and whatever settlements were there.

167
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:06,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Settlements is a pretty mild name for what actually happens.

168
00:19:06,598 --> 00:19:09,362
[SPEAKER_04]: These are really like colonial enclaves.

169
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:30,208
[SPEAKER_04]: But Israel maintained a total land, air, and sea blockade of Gaza since that time, and Gaza has been appropriately referred to as an open-air prison, because nothing goes in and out unless Israel says so.

170
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:40,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip are inhabited by Palestinians who are pushed out of historic Palestine, so they are refugees from their own land.

171
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:54,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And then after 1967, armed Israeli settlers started to expand into the West Bank, protected by the Israeli armed forces, and now they control the vast majority of the West Bank.

172
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:09,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So the West Bank and Gaza were under the limited rule of the Palestine Authority, but the residents of Gaza chose Hamas to be their elected leaders in 2007.

173
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:24,131
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're interested in just one book that speaks very well to this conflict, it's by an Israeli historian, Ilan Pape.

174
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:27,054
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine.

175
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:34,616
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't want to read a book, you can listen to a recent interview with Professor Pape on Democracy Now.

176
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:43,279
[SPEAKER_04]: It's titled Israeli Historian, Ilan Pape on Gaza War, Hostages, and the Context Behind the Current Violence.

177
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:54,022
[SPEAKER_04]: So that pretty much sums up my historical background, so to speak.

178
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Muneer.

179
00:20:56,678 --> 00:21:10,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I think while you're speaking, I'm both appreciating the capacity for a multi-ethnic secular nation and also thinking about our own hope around maybe just standing in solidarity against oppression of all kinds.

180
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:15,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking about Steve's words on Vietnam and some sort of high-level parallels.

181
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:19,443
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe, Steve, if I could lean on you to share

182
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:29,329
[SPEAKER_02]: A summary, brief summary, that's probably an extremely difficult question to ask, but about what's happening in this moment?

183
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:32,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

184
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:33,912
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what I know.

185
00:21:35,954 --> 00:21:42,359
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the Gaza Health Ministry is reporting that deaths are over 18,000 in Gaza.

186
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:45,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 18,000 people have been killed since October 7th.

187
00:21:52,326 --> 00:21:53,747
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 7,000 children.

188
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:59,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high percentage of Gazans are young, under the age of 19.

189
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:03,332
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the people who are suffering.

190
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:18,319
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a brief clip a couple of days ago on a news station, an interview with an Israeli tank commander who was in South Gaza.

191
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:25,727
[SPEAKER_00]: and who said that he was in his tank and they were in their operation.

192
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:27,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pause for a minute.

193
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:34,829
[SPEAKER_00]: He was saying that their goal is to knock down every building in the particular city they were in.

194
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:37,169
[SPEAKER_00]: That was their objective.

195
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:38,430
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the tanks were there for.

196
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:53,258
[SPEAKER_00]: according to reliable sources, 80 percent of the buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or severely hampered.

197
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:54,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighty percent.

198
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:58,000
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a million and a half people who are homeless.

199
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's a correct number.

200
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:07,764
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a humanitarian emergency of great proportions.

201
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:10,065
[SPEAKER_00]: These are incredible numbers.

202
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:19,941
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gaza Strip, the area where people have been forced into, is about the size of Delaware.

203
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:21,282
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how small it is.

204
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:25,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And more ordinance has been dropped on them.

205
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:37,294
[SPEAKER_00]: The number I looked it up is 25,000 tons of bombs, half of which are the so-called dumb bombs.

206
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:40,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure there is really a smart bomb.

207
00:23:41,692 --> 00:23:51,135
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't distinguish between civilians and armed soldiers or combatants.

208
00:23:52,893 --> 00:23:54,154
[SPEAKER_00]: the so-called smart bombs.

209
00:23:55,575 --> 00:23:59,777
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just be a little bit better targeted.

210
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:10,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I also know about the current situation is the vast majority of the weapons that the Israeli Defense Forces are using are made in America.

211
00:24:11,745 --> 00:24:19,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly their so-called smart bombs all come from the United States.

212
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,692
[SPEAKER_00]: It is us who are providing this ordinance.

213
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:22,692
[SPEAKER_00]: here.

214
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:35,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, and I think most people know, that 1,200 Israelis were killed approximately on October 7th in a horrendous attack by Hamas.

215
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:38,702
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, over 18,000

216
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:46,399
[SPEAKER_00]: Palestinians, Gazans have died, and quite a number in the settlements.

217
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:53,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a high number like that, but there are increasing numbers of Palestinians in the settlements who are being targeted.

218
00:24:56,847 --> 00:25:11,138
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a situation that when put in context of what has been happening, as Munir described, how the Israelis control Gaza,

219
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:17,808
[SPEAKER_00]: refusing to allow supplies.

220
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,791
[SPEAKER_00]: This is before October 7th.

221
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:30,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Refusing to allow adequate medical supplies and other kinds of humanitarian aid to enter Gaza.

222
00:25:30,301 --> 00:25:33,865
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast numbers of people were unemployed.

223
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:44,734
[SPEAKER_00]: think 60% is the number I saw, unemployment in Gaza before this present conflict began.

224
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:46,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were hurting.

225
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:56,702
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a humanitarian crisis happening before this bombing, and now, since the devastation is

226
00:25:57,995 --> 00:25:59,076
[SPEAKER_00]: just hard to describe.

227
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:08,086
[SPEAKER_00]: A resource that folks may want to look at, there was a statement issued by Oxfam America on, I believe it was December 2nd.

228
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:11,890
[SPEAKER_00]: It was written by Abby Maxman.

229
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:21,055
[SPEAKER_00]: who's the CEO, also a Winchester resident.

230
00:26:23,976 --> 00:26:34,240
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very powerful statement, brief, and to the point, looking at this crisis from a humanitarian point of view.

231
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,461
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nonpartisan organization.

232
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:43,464
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not taking sides, except on part of people who are being destroyed.

233
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:46,225
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the mission of their organization.

234
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:52,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And she writes as a Jew and as a lifelong humanitarian and the head of Oxfam.

235
00:26:53,048 --> 00:27:09,456
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, and she's describing what she sees from that perspective and calling for a ceasefire and then paying attention to the needs of the civilians in that area.

236
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:11,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Well worth reading, very moving.

237
00:27:14,944 --> 00:27:15,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

238
00:27:15,485 --> 00:27:25,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I think another piece that's on my mind in terms of this moment is sort of precedent setting and what kind of a complete disregard for international law.

239
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:31,343
[SPEAKER_02]: This moment might inform moving forward or sort of lack thereof, maybe.

240
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:42,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I should add, your words just reminded me of one point I think people should be aware of.

241
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:59,522
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a recent Security Council discussion at the United Nations of this issue, where the members wanted to call for a ceasefire, a humanitarian ceasefire, and it was vetoed by the US.

242
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:26,988
[SPEAKER_00]: And Munir might know, or maybe Barry might know, the number of resolutions trying to address the asymmetrical situation in that area for, I don't know, 40 or 50 years with resolutions that in the General Assembly are approved by vast majorities, and in the Security Council, always vetoed by the United States.

243
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:52,734
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm embarrassed as a member of this country to know that my government has been instrumental in committing the kinds of support necessary to make this horrific, it's not a conclusion, but outcome of past policies.

244
00:28:53,955 --> 00:28:56,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see how it could get much worse than it is right now.

245
00:28:59,728 --> 00:29:00,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Steve.

246
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:08,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, too, you know, I think, Barry, in your introduction, you talked about just this, you know, the Jewish people and this historic oppression of Jews.

247
00:29:08,751 --> 00:29:17,994
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think one word that we're hearing a lot around what's happening in Gaza is, and the reactions to it, is antisemitism.

248
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:23,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wonder if, like, you could share how that's, you know, being brought up in this context.

249
00:29:24,733 --> 00:29:35,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we sure are hearing that a lot in our communities and especially around what's happening on university campuses.

250
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:46,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a little bit telling that we're not hearing a whole lot in the mainstream media about Islamophobia or anti-Arab or anti-Palestinian hate, even though

251
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:57,899
[SPEAKER_03]: there's actually been more violence against those groups in recent weeks than there have been against Jews, but there's probably been more rhetoric against Jews.

252
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Antisemitism is real in this country.

253
00:30:04,146 --> 00:30:07,090
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was almost two years ago, I was

254
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:13,246
[SPEAKER_03]: on a podcast here and talking about that specifically.

255
00:30:13,406 --> 00:30:20,209
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real, it's endemic, it exists implicitly as well as explicitly just like racism does.

256
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:22,410
[SPEAKER_03]: It's baked into our culture.

257
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:33,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And as real as it is, it doesn't mean that every accusation of antisemitism is necessarily valid.

258
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:37,017
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I think what's happening now is where

259
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:50,336
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing antisemitism used as a deflection away from looking at the horrors that are being inflicted on Gaza by Israel and the United States.

260
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:58,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reality of antisemitism is being weaponized

261
00:30:58,743 --> 00:31:06,629
[SPEAKER_03]: in support of Israel and in support of this war and against criticism of Israel and the war.

262
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:23,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And it leads to absurdities like the recent House of Representatives hearing on anti-Semitism on college campuses where you have a group of anti-Semitic Christian nationalist Republicans

263
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:29,580
[SPEAKER_03]: all of a sudden, defending the rights of Jews.

264
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:36,045
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so you have Elise Stefanik, who is a proponent of replacement theory, leading the hearing.

265
00:31:36,846 --> 00:31:50,517
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have, you know, with the support of Marjorie Taylor Greene, who blamed the fires in the Pacific Northwest a couple of years ago, not on climate change, but on Jewish space lasers.

266
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:58,463
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, these are the people who are standing up and calling out anti-Semitism on university campuses.

267
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:05,045
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening is language is being abused all over the place.

268
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:11,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Intifada, which just means uprising, can be peaceful.

269
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:14,007
[SPEAKER_03]: The Arab Spring was an intifada.

270
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:26,518
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but it's being reinterpreted by Elise Stefanik to mean genocide of Jews.

271
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:35,583
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what she accused the university presidents of not standing up to the use of the word intifada.

272
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:42,067
[SPEAKER_03]: You see river to the sea, which is an ambiguous term.

273
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,709
[SPEAKER_03]: By some people, it means

274
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,773
[SPEAKER_03]: getting rid of the Jews from the river to the sea.

275
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:52,595
[SPEAKER_03]: But from the beginning, what it meant was everybody should be free from the river to the sea.

276
00:32:52,996 --> 00:32:54,016
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all inclusive.

277
00:32:54,456 --> 00:33:08,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, Likud, the founding member, the founding document of Likud, which is the ruling party in Israel, calls for Israeli Jewish sovereignty from the river to the sea.

278
00:33:09,802 --> 00:33:10,462
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.

279
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:37,615
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so there's all of this abusive language, but especially what I'm seeing is that criticism of Israel and Israeli policies and anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are all equated, all conflated as if they're the same thing, and they are all

280
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,523
[SPEAKER_03]: different things.

281
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:48,873
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many Zionists who are critical of the Israeli government and Israeli policies, and even of the war.

282
00:33:50,414 --> 00:33:58,202
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many Jews, including rabbis, who are anti-Zionist, and anti-Zionist itself can be

283
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:04,780
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what a Zionist means, there's many, many different types of Zionism and definitions of Zionism.

284
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could take a whole podcast to kind of parse out.

285
00:34:11,303 --> 00:34:19,487
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point being that I am a Jew, I work with rabbis on this, and

286
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:24,876
[SPEAKER_03]: I consider myself anti-Zionist, and so do many rabbis.

287
00:34:25,636 --> 00:34:26,917
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not anti-Semites.

288
00:34:27,557 --> 00:34:46,064
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really dangerous for Jews to claim that Jewish identity is bound up with the Israeli state, because what that means, if that's true,

289
00:34:47,464 --> 00:35:03,608
[SPEAKER_03]: If all Jews, in order to really be a Jew, have to support Israel, and if Israel is acting immorally, as it is right now, that means that we all, all of us Jews, are legitimate targets.

290
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:05,929
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wrong.

291
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:14,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really, really a dangerous position to take.

292
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:27,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Jews are not all responsible for what's going on in Gaza, just as Palestinians are not responsible for the attacks of Hamas in southern Israel.

293
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:37,811
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to be recognizing everyone's humanity in this conflict and outside of this conflict.

294
00:35:39,613 --> 00:35:41,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say, though, that

295
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:46,591
[SPEAKER_03]: some of my thinking is changing on this.

296
00:35:47,852 --> 00:36:02,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Until a couple of weeks ago, I basically regarded all of the accusations of antisemitism as being deliberate lies and acts of demagoguery.

297
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:08,145
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm now just kind of seeing, talking, especially with

298
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:21,100
[SPEAKER_03]: older Jews, Jews of my generation and Steve's who were born soon after the Holocaust and many of whom have attachments to Israel.

299
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:34,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just seeing that these expressions are, while wrong, they're sincere expressions of fear coming out of trauma.

300
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:48,138
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to recognize that as well, that we just need to be really careful with each other.

301
00:36:50,500 --> 00:37:07,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have seen some callousness among my colleagues in support of Palestinian rights towards the attacks by Hamas, regarding the attacks by Hamas.

302
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:14,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And that callousness is not okay.

303
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,933
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, attacks on civilians is not okay.

304
00:37:16,994 --> 00:37:18,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Killing children is not okay.

305
00:37:18,774 --> 00:37:19,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Rape is not okay.

306
00:37:19,794 --> 00:37:21,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Bombing hospitals is not okay.

307
00:37:21,814 --> 00:37:23,435
[SPEAKER_03]: None of this is okay.

308
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:33,197
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to support human rights for everybody, and we need to support peace for everybody.

309
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:42,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a perfect segue in the name of supporting peace for everybody.

310
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:53,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Do folks have thoughts on what we here in Medford, our community of Medfordites, can be doing, reading, thinking about, sharing?

311
00:37:53,827 --> 00:37:59,091
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some tangible items that we can be pursuing in community?

312
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:04,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just mention a few things.

313
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:13,139
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned earlier, I have been active in Palestine-Israel advocacy for most of my adult life.

314
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:21,586
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm obviously very concerned about the current military conflict in Gaza and Israel.

315
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:32,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I don't have any relatives living now in Israel or Palestine, several members of my son-in-law's extended family were killed

316
00:38:32,742 --> 00:38:43,811
[SPEAKER_04]: by an Israeli airstrike on a historic church in southern Gaza, where they were sheltering away from their home in the northern section of Gaza.

317
00:38:43,911 --> 00:38:49,315
[SPEAKER_04]: This trip, as I mentioned, as somebody had mentioned before, it's like about twice the size of Washington, D.C.

318
00:38:50,456 --> 00:38:54,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I'm currently working with several groups on a resolution

319
00:38:55,048 --> 00:39:22,147
[SPEAKER_04]: that would immediately stop the bombing, release all hostages and prisoners, and end the total air, land, and sea blockade on Gaza that prevents food, water, and essential materials from reaching the civilian population of Gaza, and prevents starvation, which is actually starting to happen, disease, and homelessness for millions of innocent Palestinians who are trapped there.

320
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:52,845
[SPEAKER_04]: There, I am working with some other folks on, you know, we've been, almost many of us, I know Steve and Mary and certainly members of my family, have been on almost daily calls to our politicians, like our local representative, Clark,

321
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:22,696
[SPEAKER_04]: and who, I might add, knows very well the history and the background of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but her, I think, love of power and the fact that she's scared that AIPAC might start attacking her,

322
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:31,994
[SPEAKER_04]: She just refuses to issue any half-decent statement about the conflict.

323
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:38,698
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also doing some work, doing the same thing of advocacy for our two senators.

324
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:51,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I think Elizabeth Warren has been a little more forthcoming in trying to support the peace initiative.

325
00:40:51,526 --> 00:40:52,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Senator Markey,

326
00:40:53,617 --> 00:41:01,580
[SPEAKER_04]: as he's done for most of his career, either in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, again, refuses to budge.

327
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:18,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I've been with many groups over the years to his offices, he just, again, is a, you know, to my way of thinking, under total control of what might call the Israel lobby and afraid to speak out for peace.

328
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Other efforts now we're trying to

329
00:41:23,421 --> 00:41:40,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there are several human rights commissions in the greater Boston area that have issued statements asking for the end of the bombing and for condemning the violence on both sides.

330
00:41:40,654 --> 00:41:47,799
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to get Medford to do so, so far unsuccessfully, but we're gonna keep at it.

331
00:41:50,236 --> 00:42:04,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I can add some resources if people want to learn more, and maybe you all can post it on the website once this goes live.

332
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:18,538
[SPEAKER_03]: A person who I really enjoy reading in general, he writes and speaks especially on Israel and Palestine, but also on

333
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:25,801
[SPEAKER_03]: on both domestic and international issues is Peter Beinart.

334
00:42:27,162 --> 00:42:31,104
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a weekly Substack newsletter.

335
00:42:31,204 --> 00:42:35,727
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a commentator on MSNBC, his writing appears in various places.

336
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:44,552
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's both a brilliant and a wonderful human being.

337
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:54,508
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a recent podcast from Naomi Klein that was also brilliant and very helpful.

338
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:57,991
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd recommend that anybody who has time take a look at that.

339
00:43:00,713 --> 00:43:06,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Ali Abou Ahwad is the head of a group called Taghir, which is a

340
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:18,179
[SPEAKER_03]: a Palestinian group committed to nonviolence and a just resolution of the situation.

341
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:34,104
[SPEAKER_03]: also appears in webinars and speaking tours, as does Jonathan Kuttab, an internationally renowned human rights lawyer.

342
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,405
[SPEAKER_03]: He is a Christian Palestinian.

343
00:43:36,485 --> 00:43:37,885
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives in California.

344
00:43:38,846 --> 00:43:45,388
[SPEAKER_03]: He works with a group called Foundation for Middle East Peace, which is affiliated with Nonviolence International.

345
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:49,269
[SPEAKER_03]: These are groups that are worth looking at.

346
00:43:51,835 --> 00:44:09,746
[SPEAKER_03]: two groups and there's more working in Palestine, Israel to try to achieve peace and who are struggling through this time because it's so fraught there, are the groups standing together and combatants for peace.

347
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:11,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And

348
00:44:13,977 --> 00:44:25,683
[SPEAKER_03]: And a couple of news sources to look at are Jewish Currents, one of the chief editors there is Peter Beinart and 972mag.com.

349
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:51,297
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I would add will probably be too late for the podcast, but I think it's important for people to know that Medford's Interfaith Group is hosting a prayer and conversation session

350
00:44:53,998 --> 00:45:04,141
[SPEAKER_00]: It will include meditation and time to grieve and things of that nature on Tuesday, December 19th, 7 p.m.

351
00:45:06,821 --> 00:45:08,682
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine it will be recorded.

352
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:09,622
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know for sure.

353
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:18,942
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be nice to know the outcomes of that.

354
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:27,650
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks should check out social media and other sources to find out how that went and if there'll be follow-ups to that.

355
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:38,180
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least it's an attempt by several faith communities in Medford to begin talking about this.

356
00:45:39,441 --> 00:45:40,642
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage that.

357
00:45:41,766 --> 00:45:42,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all.

358
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:47,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we started this conversation framing it as a dialogue about what's happening in Gaza.

359
00:45:47,210 --> 00:46:04,003
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that there was a bit of alignment in the conversation and just to sort of stress the importance of a continued dialogue, even across like belief systems and dialogue when maybe there isn't agreement around the topic.

360
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,406
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you all so much for your time today.

361
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:09,568
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, I really enjoyed our dialogue together.

362
00:46:10,228 --> 00:46:13,129
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, Shelly, for your thoughtful questions.

363
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thank you, everybody.

364
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:17,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate this.

365
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you both for organizing this.

366
00:46:19,793 --> 00:46:20,213
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

367
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:21,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you very much.

368
00:46:21,853 --> 00:46:23,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for inviting us.

369
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, same for me.

370
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:27,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate the work you do.

371
00:46:37,473 --> 00:46:39,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.

372
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:44,580
[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford Bites podcast is produced and moderated by Danielle Balacca and Shelly Keshaman.

373
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Music is made by Hendrik Giedonis.

374
00:46:47,743 --> 00:46:49,844
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd love to hear what you think about the podcast.

377
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, what's the name of the podcast?

378
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Never Bites.

379
00:47:09,587 --> 00:47:11,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Never Bites.

380
00:47:11,257 --> 00:47:11,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.
