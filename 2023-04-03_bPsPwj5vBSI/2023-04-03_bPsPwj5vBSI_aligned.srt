19

President, six present, one absent, if we all may rise to salute the flag.

23
00:02:03,726 --> 00:02:13,494
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

24
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:20,440
Everybody's received a packet this evening, along with our packet we received on Friday.

25
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:26,825
Budget update, I'm gonna turn it over to Madam Superintendent, Dr. Edward Vincent, to begin.

26
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:48,490
Good evening.

27
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:57,694
At this evening, I'm going to bring before the committee the second budget presentation.

28
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:05,118
I'm going to request that Dr. Cushing please screen share for us.

29
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,534
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

30
00:03:22,794 --> 00:03:44,311
As we've said before throughout last year and this year, as we enter the budget season, it's a time for us to really

31
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:55,596
look hard at what our priorities are in terms of how the school will function, the district as a whole, and how we will be able to meet the needs of all of our students.

32
00:03:56,577 --> 00:04:00,541
And so as we go into this budget update that I'm going to share with you,

33
00:04:01,943 --> 00:04:03,284
There's a lot of information.

34
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:21,516
And as I prepare and share this information with you, I want you to be aware that there will be a point where you're going to realize that we have to look at making decisions in terms of what

35
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:25,026
our highest priorities are going to be for this fiscal year.

36
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:43,225
So I'm going to start right now, but I am asking you to be open-minded, hear what our current situation is right now, and then for us to think together collaboratively on what next steps could end up looking like.

37
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:59,498
So as I started at our last presentation, I had shared with you where our budget ended for this current fiscal year, fiscal year 23.

38
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,642
We had a budget 68.9, which was our operating budget.

39
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:09,365
Dr. Cushing?

40
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:28,315
The following slide shows our approximate percentages by function of how the budget was divided up in between all of the different key areas.

41
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:30,157
Next slide.

42
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,084
This slide that you're looking at is showing us

43
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:47,922
FY, what our current FY23 budget approximate spending is.

44
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:57,087
And the following slide is gonna show you, even though it says 24, there's a slight difference.

45
00:05:57,927 --> 00:06:03,830
And I'm going to unpack this information for you, because we do have some increases.

46
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,610
So normally,

47
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:12,713
Our personnel expenses are about 85, 86% of the budget.

48
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:26,298
And with the increased costs, what we're going to be, what it's going to feel like this year is that it's closer to 89% is going to be allocated toward

49
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,864
personnel costs.

50
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:39,512
So I want to kind of put that out there because we do have some increases.

51
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:46,361
So here on this particular slide, you see that we have the scales that are moving.

52
00:06:46,921 --> 00:07:03,648
And we are going to try with this budget cycle to maintain the balance, to continue the services that we're offering to our students, and where appropriate or based on priorities or needs, make the necessary adjustments there.

53
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,251
Next slide, please.

54
00:07:18,797 --> 00:07:24,409
So in FY23, our estimated budget was as follows.

55
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,616
This was our ESSER funding.

56
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:48,851
And this is what I presented to you last month on expenditures that we spent for engagement specialists, school nurses, behavioral specialists, reading specialists, EL newcomer teacher, and contractual stipends.

57
00:07:51,433 --> 00:07:54,695
Coming off of our ESSER funding totaled 1.6 million.

58
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:59,098
HEAL for Literacy, our literacy programming,

59
00:08:00,464 --> 00:08:27,225
responsive classroom, Camp Mustang, again, we had funds dependent, transportation, we set aside 150,000, our emergency connectivity fund for technology, and then we had some miscellaneous items of additional counseling programs, our rebus professional development, which was for our administrators,

60
00:08:27,885 --> 00:08:44,078
and talking points, which is an online subscription, which allows us to communicate very frequently with all of our parent groups, our entire community, but it also translates for the members of the community that do not speak English.

61
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,040
Next slide.

62
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:56,007
So our FY 24 budget drivers are going to be-

63
00:08:58,561 --> 00:09:03,122
Member Graham, do you want us to hold all our questions till the end or do you wanna take questions as you go?

64
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:05,663
Dr. Vincent, totally up to you.

65
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:09,084
You wanna complete the slideshow and then questions after or?

66
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,825
I was gonna try, but Member Graham.

67
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:12,385
No, it's totally fine.

68
00:09:12,405 --> 00:09:13,105
I don't care either way.

69
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:13,926
I just wanted to know.

70
00:09:13,946 --> 00:09:24,889
Yeah, if I could go through the slides and if there's really something that I'm saying that isn't clear, cause I repeat some key factors again a little later in the slide deck.

71
00:09:25,429 --> 00:09:26,950
So my hope is that,

72
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,651
some of your questions that might be forming.

73
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:45,938
I may be able to answer some of them later in the slide deck, but I am trying to at least give an overview of like what it is that we're facing during this fiscal year, upcoming fiscal year.

74
00:09:47,619 --> 00:09:53,182
So for our FY 24 budget drivers, the arrows going up

75
00:09:54,787 --> 00:10:00,170
our growing student needs, rising costs and expenses.

76
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:04,013
In particular, we have our new CBAs as well.

77
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:17,220
And using our one-time funds, which is the ESSER money, which I had shared, we have that final $3 million for this year, but this is the final year.

78
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,743
Dr. Cushing?

79
00:10:28,157 --> 00:10:28,757
Dr. Cushing?

80
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:30,758
Thank you.

81
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:43,806
On this slide, it's showing you a side-by-side comparison for some of our estimated budget costs moving forward.

82
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:48,628
And again, the previous slide.

83
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:53,831
Can you go back one please?

84
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:56,893
Thank you.

85
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:02,405
So as this is the final year of our funding.

86
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:14,008
We have to really really think about some of the investments that we've made, and that after this year, after school year 2324.

87
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,371
the monies are not gonna be there.

88
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:24,815
So that's an additional $3 million that we have to really just think about.

89
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:37,764
And so I wanna say that so that as I show you where we're trying to make some adjustments, it's something that we're gonna really need to think about.

90
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,066
And so in this FY24 column,

91
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:52,920
Again, these are estimated what we're expected to be paying in the following school year.

92
00:11:54,545 --> 00:12:10,676
So in some areas, there's a slight increase, and in other areas, there may be a slight decrease based on the total number of personnel that we're talking about.

93
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:16,079
So where engagement specialists are concerned, we're seeing a slight decrease.

94
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:24,025
The additional school nurse that we have, which is a floater, that's to be determined.

95
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,910
For behavioral specialists, we're expecting a slight increase of 130,000.

96
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:44,786
As of right now, we're still trying to fine tune it, but we may need to make one additional increase of a reading specialist, which would be 200,000.

97
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:52,282
For an ELL newcomer teacher, again, that's to be determined.

98
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:55,282
That number could fluctuate a little bit, a slight increase.

99
00:12:56,603 --> 00:13:10,645
And for the obligated contractual stipends for next payment, we're anticipating 750,000 that is set aside for those payments to be made.

100
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:13,266
Hill for Literacy,

101
00:13:15,655 --> 00:13:27,122
Again, estimated we have an additional year of professional development with them and responsive classrooms slash restorative justice, professional learning opportunities.

102
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:33,365
We are estimating a slight increase, potentially of $100,000.

103
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:33,626
Next slide.

104
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:55,829
Again, for FY24, our counseling programs, we're expecting to stay in the same vicinity of about 80,000.

105
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:00,929
For our Rebus professional development, that is to be determined.

106
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:14,152
We're expecting that number to decrease slightly because we want to transition, continue working with Dr. Rebus, but in a slightly different capacity.

107
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:31,486
talking points in some of our other subscriptions where we're in the process of looking at all of the user, what's the percentage of actual usage because we, we, we activated, a lot of subscriptions.

108
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:39,411
And not all of them during the time of the pandemic, they were used more frequently but now that we're back in person.

109
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:50,658
There isn't as great a need for all of the subscriptions and if there's a way even to take some of those monies and apply it elsewhere where it's actually being used.

110
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53,560
We are looking at that very very closely.

111
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:05,791
our emergency connectivity fund where that's to be determined for our MBTA pass program, where we are currently paying 15,000 a month.

112
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:08,594
Again, that would be for the committee to decide.

113
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:11,517
So we left that as a to be determined.

114
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:18,984
And for summer programming, we have that as to be determined for this summer and next summer.

115
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:26,545
Dr. Cushing, next slide, please.

116
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,373
Thank you.

117
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:35,481
So as we look at our employment agreements that we had thus far, FY22 was 2.5%, $960,000.

118
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,884
Nearly one million was paid retroactively from FY22 funds.

119
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:41,385
For FY23, our current fiscal year, 2.5% increase.

120
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,384
$1 million was paid from additional funding that was incorporated into our FY 23 budget.

121
00:16:04,444 --> 00:16:05,484
We anticipated a 2% increase.

122
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:08,346
So, we ended up.

123
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:20,339
It's a nominal increase, a nominal savings, I should say.

124
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:29,541
FY24 budget, it's a 2.5% increase plus 1% on the 100th day of school.

125
00:16:30,341 --> 00:16:38,624
And so that is a 1.1 million fixed cost increase based on our FY23 increase.

126
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:46,806
And that number of the 1.1 million represents our teachers only, does not represent the remaining CBAs.

127
00:16:47,346 --> 00:16:47,406
you

128
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:50,361
So what does that mean?

129
00:16:50,381 --> 00:17:05,767
The reason that the base salary increases were such a frequent topic of discussion during our budget cycles is because as you incorporate the increase into the base, the base increases.

130
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:18,152
And so if I were to go back to that earlier slide where I said how it's going to feel, we have a larger base that we have to take into consideration.

131
00:17:18,952 --> 00:17:26,560
So we're talking about essentially a $3 million increase in our base operating budget.

132
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,167
Dr. Cushing.

133
00:17:38,371 --> 00:17:41,534
So our FY 24 budgetary priorities.

134
00:17:44,508 --> 00:18:04,197
We talked about strategic staffing investments focused on our most vulnerable learners from literacy interventionists, social workers, adjustment counselors, expanded school day staff, theater teacher, and due to increasing

135
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,683
increased enrollment on our CTE side of the house.

136
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:14,907
We have to think about more students attending CTE.

137
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:23,833
It may be shifting staff from the comprehensive high school, but I do want to just put that on everyone's radar.

138
00:18:25,154 --> 00:18:39,252
That due to the increased interest in CTE programming, we will need to think about shifting resources to meet the needs to meet the demand of our students that are there.

139
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:54,623
For professional development and training, again, restorative practices, curriculum training, we're in the process of getting ready to select a brand new literacy program at the elementary levels, at the elementary math.

140
00:18:55,783 --> 00:19:02,748
We will be entering our second year of additional professional development with the new programming.

141
00:19:03,248 --> 00:19:10,153
So we do need to keep that in mind for district-wide professional development and building-based professional development.

142
00:19:11,834 --> 00:19:14,777
Summer programming, which is grant dependent.

143
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:20,001
We offered literacy, math, fine arts, and cell programming.

144
00:19:21,302 --> 00:19:30,789
And looking into seeing if it's the opportunity to add a traditional array of additional summer programming options.

145
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:34,272
And so that is a need that we know we have.

146
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:52,059
And then under a miscellaneous requirement, based on the new CBA, we need to work with outside scheduling consultants to merge the two schedules between the high school and the vocational school.

147
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:58,304
where the high school is on a six day cycle and the vocational school is on a five day cycle.

148
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:15,439
And so by having that alignment between the two schedules, it will allow for even greater flexibility between a vocational programming and a comprehensive side of the house.

149
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:20,223
So really trying to give our students the greatest high school experience possible.

150
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:24,328
and that needs to happen with schedules that talk to one another.

151
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,554
Dr. Cushing, thank you.

152
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,878
So some of our fixed cost increases.

153
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:43,733
And I will, coming up shortly in the slide, I will show you some of this information in a different format.

154
00:20:45,134 --> 00:20:55,644
So some of our fixed cost drivers, I mentioned at my last presentation, the FY24 special education increases, which are significant, a 14% increase.

155
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:15,287
projected to amount to potentially $1,000,000 or over $1,000,000 FY 24 contractual increases amount to 3.3 million in increases to personnel expenses alone.

156
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:31,419
And again, as I said, a significant portion of the increases that took place in FY 22 and 23 were already incorporated into our last budgets because we were anticipating the negotiations.

157
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:43,326
But still, with what's happening right now with FY 23 and 24, the increases have exceeded what was originally budgeted as a

158
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:47,209
holding amount.

159
00:21:48,190 --> 00:22:05,300
So we have used as much flexibility as possible, but now we're really in an area where we have to really be cautious and strategic in terms of what we're going to prioritize as a district.

160
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:10,183
are increases to FY 24 vendors.

161
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:15,887
Those numbers are still slightly to be determined, but the numbers are going up and not down.

162
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:34,272
And we still have the remaining three teams to negotiations that are remaining representing administrators, custodians, our security monitors and food service workers.

163
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:39,493
So there are four more CBAs that need to be completed this year.

164
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:45,134
And those numbers will be added to what's being presented right now.

165
00:22:46,735 --> 00:22:58,162
So at our last presentation, I talked about our strategic priorities, which are essentially our strategic plan, it's ACES priority one.

166
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:18,288
Implementing curricular assessment and instructional strategies, anything related to academics and achievement priority to which is collaboration but building culture, also through community engagement priority three equity, how can we equitably support.

167
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:30,498
All of our most vulnerable learners, those are students that need additional social, emotional learning supports, academic supports, and meeting the physical needs of our students.

168
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:41,547
And priority for our school infrastructure and looking at student supports and providing a safe, supportive learning environment.

169
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:52,071
So we will continue to look at the work that we do through a multi-tiered system of support.

170
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:56,673
Tier one supports meeting the needs of all of our students.

171
00:23:57,473 --> 00:24:06,716
Tier two supports, again, providing scaffolded supports in tier three for our students that need the most greatest support.

172
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:10,898
So keeping students at the center of our decision-making

173
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:33,101
providing data to support student-centered learning, providing educators with necessary and needed professional development, especially as we're bringing on brand new curriculum, brand new programs, instructional programs, partnering with our community and building new partnerships to support our students.

174
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:40,554
Working with families and caregivers to support and work collaboratively with the district.

175
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:52,464
Always keeping the focus of preparing our students for college or career and really making sure that their high school experience prepares them for college or career.

176
00:24:54,466 --> 00:25:01,898
and to continue to thrive in supporting and making all of our students feel like there was a strong sense of belonging.

177
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:10,070
So those are things that we're going to continue to do and keep front and center as we look at our budget this year.

178
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:18,209
Dr. Cushing, I think this was a repeat slide.

179
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:20,032
We can move forward.

180
00:25:22,656 --> 00:25:23,718
There's a slide before that.

181
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,499
Thank you.

182
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:28,526
So again, areas of concern.

183
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:35,529
We may have to look at staffing or potential downsizing.

184
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,014
Moving forward, our special education costs.

185
00:25:42,755 --> 00:25:48,619
The increase is considerable, although we know there will be some additional grant funding.

186
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,385
but those numbers may fluctuate with respect to the budgetary impact.

187
00:25:55,566 --> 00:25:57,889
That is, it's kind of an unknown number.

188
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:01,612
If changes need to happen, we need to meet the needs of our students.

189
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,076
What are the impacts going to be on our students?

190
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:11,903
And again, as a district, as an administrative team working collaboratively with the committee,

191
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:15,364
We want to assess our genuine needs.

192
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:18,786
We're going to advocate for additional investment.

193
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:27,189
And three, we do want to plan for contingencies to ensure that we will be able to function fully.

194
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,292
So this is another way to look at our anticipated increases.

195
00:26:36,792 --> 00:26:40,337
The out-of-district tuition increases of 14%.

196
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:46,785
We're currently at 3.7 million, approximately there right now.

197
00:26:47,787 --> 00:26:53,254
And for FY24, we're expecting it to be in the vicinity of 4.2 million.

198
00:26:56,385 --> 00:27:07,235
for our transportation and van students, van transportation for students that are traveling for, that need specialized transportation.

199
00:27:07,255 --> 00:27:10,938
We're currently at 1.5 million for FY23.

200
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:21,304
And for FY 24, we're expecting it to fall in the vicinity of $2.2 million.

201
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:25,426
So that is another increase for transportation.

202
00:27:27,427 --> 00:27:31,589
Transportation for the school bus, our yellow school bus transportation.

203
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,310
We are currently at 1.2 million.

204
00:27:36,831 --> 00:27:55,337
And we are looking at other contracts and looking at our existing contract and trying to see if we're expecting to possibly be, expecting approximately another $500,000 increase if possible.

205
00:27:55,357 --> 00:27:57,398
And this is looking at other options.

206
00:27:58,758 --> 00:28:04,160
So we're anticipating 1.25 million in transportation, school bus,

207
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:07,572
Dr. Cushing.

208
00:28:09,514 --> 00:28:15,040
In addition for our utilities, gas and electric, we were approximately at 1.85 million this year for FY23.

209
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,062
We're expecting it to increase to close to $2 million for FY24.

210
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:30,789
And our cleaning contract in FY 22 was 400,000 and FY 23, it increased to 445,000.

211
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:33,971
And so for FY 24, we are expecting an additional increase.

212
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:35,732
And so if it's in keeping with what happened,

213
00:28:48,682 --> 00:28:57,153
to FY 22 to 23, it could be anywhere from 45 to 50,000 based on anticipated increases.

214
00:28:58,114 --> 00:29:03,161
So again, those are some of our anticipated increases for FY 24.

215
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:15,213
Again, the next slide here shows that we have $3 million remaining on our ESSER budget.

216
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:24,962
The good news is we did pursue a grant from DESE, and you will be hearing about that, that estimated $600,000 we were awarded.

217
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:31,848
200,000 in grant funding.

218
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:36,131
So that number will now shift to 400,000 so that is a $200,000 savings, pursuing 300,000 but it's.

219
00:29:44,907 --> 00:29:46,288
Oh, it's at 600,000.

220
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:48,110
Okay, thank you, Ms.

221
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:48,931
Galuzzi for that.

222
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,873
So we're still at 600,000.

223
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:56,298
We did receive something, but we'll report out at that at another point in time.

224
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:03,805
Balance of elementary math program, that's coming from our operating budget, but the balance was 250,000.

225
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:21,533
Again, I mentioned earlier about the restorative justice bystander intervention and responsive classroom trainings, approximately 100,000 and 90, approximately 90,000 for Hill for Literacy.

226
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:27,155
So some key determinations and milestones, Dr. Cushing.

227
00:30:32,626 --> 00:30:47,374
We're going to be thinking seriously about transportation, summer planning, the governor's budget proposal pending, and our additional upcoming committee of the whole meetings.

228
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:55,278
And our last slide just shows where we are.

229
00:30:58,368 --> 00:31:16,400
in the process right now of starting to have our first of many budget meetings to kind of talk about where we are and what our priorities need to be as a district.

230
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:23,304
Since we have two weeks back to back for this week, the intention was really to

231
00:31:24,986 --> 00:31:34,778
Let you know some of the anticipated increases that we're looking at for FY 24, and for next week's budget cow.

232
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:42,768
We will be sharing more of the data from the budget survey that did come in.

233
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:51,016
And we're looking at that and bucketing the information to kind of look at what were the things that kind of rose to the surface.

234
00:31:52,358 --> 00:31:55,901
But I wanted to at least give you that information.

235
00:31:56,202 --> 00:32:00,466
And I am open, ready for questions from the committee.

236
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,012
Member Rousseau?

237
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:07,150
Thank you, Mayor.

238
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:15,214
I wish we had page numbers, because I'm going to reference slides and realize that I can't tell you what page it's on just now.

239
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:18,416
But this one, you don't have to really go to it.

240
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:19,837
Thank you for the presentation.

241
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:29,222
I'm pretty sure there's one slide that everybody's interested in, but I'll cover my lower priority stuff first.

242
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:35,065
Are we reducing the engagement specialists because we have not hired enough, or are we getting rid of some?

243
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:37,468
I'm assuming we're not suddenly paying them less.

244
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:50,384
So right now we do not have the full cadre of five and so we were holding steady at where we were based on

245
00:32:53,712 --> 00:33:09,296
based on what we were seeing with a lot of the unanticipated costs that, you know, as we just were looking at all of the different increases that we know are fixed increases.

246
00:33:09,956 --> 00:33:14,737
So we're looking at our expenses have gone up.

247
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:20,118
and our personnel salaries have gone up.

248
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:22,859
So it's both areas going up.

249
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:31,182
And, you know, Dr. Cushing, I don't know if you could go back to that second slide.

250
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,003
No, not the second slide.

251
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:36,844
It's slide five.

252
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:56,352
where it's kind of how we would be feeling about that, just to say, if you go to four first and then five, we're going up on both sides.

253
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,613
The base is getting bigger.

254
00:33:59,235 --> 00:34:01,157
and we're going up on two sides.

255
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:11,267
And if we're trying to juggle those two sets of numbers, both numbers are going up, the other and salaries.

256
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:12,829
Thank you.

257
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:20,156
I guess I, so this is a presentation of, this feels like this is a presentation of our,

258
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,980
approved budget allocation versus our budget request.

259
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:37,783
I mean, last year and the year before and time is wonky, but we specify what we wanted and needed to operate the district.

260
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:49,386
And then we figure out how to squeeze all that down into the number we got from the city, but you're squeezing ahead of time, which means that when we go and ask the city council,

261
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:54,072
I know that we have not hired a fifth engagement specialist.

262
00:34:55,554 --> 00:35:05,209
But I would like to see, you know, based on the person who's in charge of that, and obviously, and you all like is five even enough was the right number seven.

263
00:35:06,655 --> 00:35:16,863
And sure, hiring is hard, but if the right number is four, then this makes no difference to me going from five to four, especially since we have four, it makes sense.

264
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:24,889
If the right number to support our kids who are trying to recover from the pandemic is seven, well, we should be putting seven down here.

265
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:31,514
So we know when we ask the city council, whatever the number is, if we say we need $77 million and we get a smaller number,

266
00:35:35,782 --> 00:35:39,668
in the mayor's budget, well, that's the way it's supposed to work.

267
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:49,024
But going in already with chopping, and if you're telling me we don't need five engagement specialists,

268
00:35:49,653 --> 00:35:58,461
and the kids are fine, and their specific role for them is enough, then I'm gonna believe you, because I obviously can't know that.

269
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:05,307
But you've just described this as a way to save money, and it seems like that's the step.

270
00:36:06,228 --> 00:36:12,354
In our last slide, that's one, two, three, four, five, six,

271
00:36:13,697 --> 00:36:17,559
That's like step six and step seven, except we're only in step two.

272
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:31,008
So, I mean, I see that the reading specialist went up, I'm assuming we didn't double somebody's salary, so that's great news, but that's not a money saving situation.

273
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:35,451
So this slide is sort of a mixture of attempts to save money

274
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:44,637
which I have no problem with saving money, but I don't know, like in the very first line there, is five, four, what's the right number?

275
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:47,458
Because the kids aren't okay.

276
00:36:48,638 --> 00:36:50,238
Lots of them are, but not all of them are.

277
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:58,421
And to be cutting at this early phase just seems backwards.

278
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:14,557
I'll just go through one more of my questions before we let some of my colleagues speak I have other questions but I'm in the budgetary priorities expand expanded school day staff is that just another way of saying after school.

279
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:15,698
Yes, thank you.

280
00:37:15,758 --> 00:37:21,284
It's around trying to do this around care workers and

281
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:34,473
I guess I'm surprised by that number because I pretty sure we've never budgeted anything for after school other than the director, and that the rest is just covered in the revolving account.

282
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,816
So this to me seems to suggest that we're going to use our

283
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:43,252
allocation that we get from the city and actually spend some of that on afterschool?

284
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:44,433
Is that correct?

285
00:37:44,753 --> 00:37:48,897
We are using our revolving accounts as well.

286
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,084
This was really just, it's a key priority because the afterschool programming

287
00:37:56,724 --> 00:38:01,106
is definitely an area where we're trying to beef up staff.

288
00:38:01,466 --> 00:38:02,827
And so one of the ways.

289
00:38:03,768 --> 00:38:12,052
It's not for a lack of trying, we have been trying, like, every way possible to recruit additional staff to support our programming.

290
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:13,753
And so with

291
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:32,055
the creation of this new position, we would hope to have staff that would be working part of the day during the instructional day, and then helping to cover with the after school programming, so they would be built in.

292
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,178
They would be staff that are part of.

293
00:38:36,679 --> 00:38:49,372
So, essentially they would be like surround care, and instead of doing a traditional school day they could do like after school maybe like 11 or 11 to six or 12 to six.

294
00:38:49,813 --> 00:38:53,857
We're trying to so that wouldn't that would in fact.

295
00:38:54,998 --> 00:39:01,966
mean we'd have like a double head count in some of the buildings or throughout the district but also helping to meet an after school need.

296
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:08,032
So it's it's it's trying to be creative it's it's something that we've talked about before.

297
00:39:08,653 --> 00:39:11,135
And so, we would definitely be.

298
00:39:13,457 --> 00:39:18,339
using revolving accounts to the extent possible to help support that as well.

299
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:30,444
But it is something that we wanted to have as a need so that we were at least beefing up or trying to beef up and have additional staffing to support our afterschool programming.

300
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:31,084
Thank you.

301
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:34,746
I certainly didn't have any problem with exactly what you just described.

302
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:42,269
I just want to make sure we don't get into any kind of slippery situation around

303
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:45,196
our operating budget and what it covers.

304
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:49,419
Cause it covers K to 12 and the school day.

305
00:39:49,439 --> 00:40:00,826
And then if we want to start pulling other stuff in, you know, like then that expands our scope of what our budget is supposed to cover.

306
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:05,750
And if that happens, I think it's an important, I mean, this is perhaps in one FTE.

307
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:12,634
So this is not the scenario, but like if Medford rec just suddenly became part of the public school system, our budget would go up

308
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:16,270
whatever the Medford rec budget is, presumably.

309
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:34,779
So I just want to be careful when we're expanding our scope because then it makes year over year analyses of how much of the public school spending, those kinds of things really hold a lot of weight, especially if you're doing an override and you're like, suddenly it looks like you grew this huge amount and somehow you still can't make it work.

310
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:39,161
So I just want us to be really careful about what in after school stuff

311
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:48,245
ends up being part of the operating budget, the number we approve, because that number stick, I mean, I personally look at over 20 years of our budgets.

312
00:40:49,586 --> 00:40:58,230
And there's surely been that exact situation somewhere along the way, where there was a big jump, but it wasn't because anything changed.

313
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,771
We just, you know, our scope changed.

314
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:04,072
So I just think we have to be really careful about that.

315
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:04,613
Thank you.

316
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:18,742
Member Graham, can you tell me what the total ESSER grant is?

317
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:27,008
What's the complete ESSER number that we've been granted from the feds?

318
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,891
All three combined, yeah.

319
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,727
I'll get that in a moment, what the total for all three was.

320
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:38,927
I don't have that number.

321
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:43,010
I know going into FY 24, we have 3 million left.

322
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,572
So I'll just be on the lookout for that.

323
00:41:47,152 --> 00:41:56,837
Okay, and then I think what I would like to see somehow is a picture that says like, here's all the money that we have, whatever the number is.

324
00:41:56,977 --> 00:41:58,418
I think it's 7.2 or 6.7, something like that, right?

325
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:02,827
And then like, what did we spend in FY22?

326
00:42:03,047 --> 00:42:03,988
What did we spend in FY23?

327
00:42:04,048 --> 00:42:07,049
What do we plan to spend in FY24?

328
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:13,932
So that we can see like, how did we get to the place where there's $3 million left in FY24?

329
00:42:15,593 --> 00:42:24,257
Because like, if I count up what's on the FY23 page, if there was a total on the page, it would be 2.7, I believe.

330
00:42:25,278 --> 00:42:27,439
And if there was a total on the FY22,

331
00:42:28,749 --> 00:42:35,497
four number, it would be 1.5, I think, based on what I tried to calculate.

332
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:47,070
And so I guess I'm just trying to understand like one of the things that we had to do last year was pay for things that were operating budget, clearly operating budget oriented with ESSER.

333
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:47,150
And

334
00:42:49,728 --> 00:43:16,876
want to know like where does that fit into the equation of like how we're ticking down our ESSER funds because we should spend all of it but more importantly if we have to make plans for that money to come back into the operating budget we need to know and I don't feel like I know what those what those things are that we have put in ESSER that are not one time that are recurring that either we're gonna have to make a choice about or find money to pay for

335
00:43:17,934 --> 00:43:42,175
So, when I think about Essar like in my mind, there's a picture that shows how the money has been spent over time and where there are things that if we wish to continue them because it's reasonable to think that you would that we are going to have to find a way to pay for and that doesn't have to be this year but I think we need to know that this year so that we can think carefully about what else we spend this

336
00:43:46,432 --> 00:43:48,074
that money is no longer available to us.

337
00:43:48,254 --> 00:43:54,600
And I know it's just one year away, one year from now, we'll be having that conversation, but I want to make sure we know what it is.

338
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:03,629
But I don't think that means, to Member Rousseau's point, that just because we have vacancies in a position that we don't need them.

339
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:07,513
So I do echo his comments about wanting to make sure

340
00:44:08,186 --> 00:44:23,729
that our initial budget request is actually the request that outlines what we need to promote teaching and learning in our district and not the doomsday scenario or the like contingency scenario.

341
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:31,231
Like I totally understand hard decisions and we will have to make them at some point in time, but I want the budget to be, what do the students need?

342
00:44:32,262 --> 00:44:35,324
And I don't think that means we cannot cut things right now.

343
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:49,435
I think if there are things that we are paying for that students aren't using or that they don't need, we should be proactively demonstrating to the community that we care about that and we are looking for those ways to eliminate spend.

344
00:44:49,475 --> 00:44:51,517
So if there are subscriptions out there,

345
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,937
that we're not paying for, for example, that we're paying for and the utilization is really low.

346
00:44:56,037 --> 00:44:58,983
I think the first question should be, why is the utilization low?

347
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:01,788
Like, why did we use it in COVID and all of a sudden we don't need to use it anymore?

348
00:45:02,229 --> 00:45:02,569
Is that

349
00:45:03,598 --> 00:45:10,560
because we've reverted back to some older method of how we communicate information to kids.

350
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,261
And is that what's right for kids or is that just what's comfortable in the classroom?

351
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:14,941
I'm not sure.

352
00:45:16,761 --> 00:45:30,565
But if the answer really is like, this is not a resource that we need as a district, I think we should definitely in this phase of the budget, like remove those things because I want, I do want us to demonstrate to the community that we,

353
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:37,288
Like we all know that there is no open checkbook right like so if there are things like that, where we know that.

354
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:52,804
We should be like reducing those things I want us to do that I don't want to play a game, where we say we need everything, and then we really can like cut things out like I just don't think that helps the Community or anybody in the process, so if there are things where.

355
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,531
We have staff that legitimately we do not need to promote teaching and learning.

356
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:01,272
We should be like looking at reflecting that in our, in our request.

357
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,793
Like we should not be waiting to do that until the very last minute.

358
00:46:04,893 --> 00:46:11,275
But I, I, we have done a lot of work on this committee for the last four years to really tell the community what we need.

359
00:46:12,075 --> 00:46:14,196
And we should not stop doing that.

360
00:46:14,356 --> 00:46:19,417
Even if we think we're going to have to say we had to make hard decisions and these things have to come out.

361
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:40,536
We can't stop telling the community like what the public schools need because we will be doing ourselves like a bigger picture disservice that I think this committee has worked really hard to sort of combat against in terms of the You know what the average voter thinks about how we spend our money and that we're doing it responsibly so

362
00:46:41,192 --> 00:46:44,694
I would like to see a clear, crisper picture of ESSER.

363
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:52,920
And particularly, these are things, if you want to continue these things, we have to find operating budget for them next year.

364
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,502
It would be really helpful to know that right now.

365
00:46:58,344 --> 00:47:00,025
So those are my ESSER questions.

366
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:04,408
And I think- Member Graham, I have a total ESSER funding was 8.35 million.

367
00:47:04,428 --> 00:47:04,608
8.35, okay.

368
00:47:09,992 --> 00:47:16,914
It sounds like there's a million and a half dollars not earmarked out of the three remaining.

369
00:47:17,254 --> 00:47:17,734
Is that right?

370
00:47:18,014 --> 00:47:28,878
And you can, just to be clear on that point, member Graham, and I think Dr. Edward Vincent, you mentioned that this is the last year we can use it, but I think it bleeds into the first quarter of fiscal year 25.

371
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:39,781
So, so I don't know how much the district plans on holding ESSER because we will need it for portion of it, especially when you have so many positions and you're going to have a fiscal cliff, there's going to be some sort of

372
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:42,826
portion that is going to be held for fiscal year twenty-five.

373
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:47,749
That's where how we're negotiating it on the city side too.

374
00:47:47,789 --> 00:47:53,771
You'll be able to use some revenue replacement, fiscal year twenty-four, the full year, and part of fiscal year twenty-five.

375
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,794
So, that might be different on the ESSER side but we should definitely take that into account.

376
00:47:59,014 --> 00:48:00,655
Yeah.

377
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:05,537
So, I think on the and I will just ask my last ESSER question and then

378
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,779
I do have some other questions, but I'm happy to let somebody else ask questions.

379
00:48:10,819 --> 00:48:17,584
It sounds like what I counted here was about 1.5 on the FY 24 side out of three.

380
00:48:17,865 --> 00:48:19,766
So there's still a million and a half dollars.

381
00:48:20,026 --> 00:48:28,093
So if some portion of that needs to be held for FY 25, I think we want to know what that is now so that we can make sure that if there is

382
00:48:29,045 --> 00:48:43,608
cushion there, just like we did last year, like the next presentation you give us can clearly outline like, these are things that belong in the operating budget, but like, if necessary, we could use ESSER to do these things in the short term.

383
00:48:43,708 --> 00:48:56,191
So I thought what we did last time worked really well to say like, this stuff is like critical path, we must do it, like we start with the top line fixed costs, then this is critical path, we must do these things, we have to have this stuff, it costs this.

384
00:48:56,707 --> 00:49:01,573
And then there's like another category of like, we need to have these things, but we could use ESSA for them for now.

385
00:49:01,973 --> 00:49:08,942
Versus like, these are the things that are really high priority and like, they could be either bucket, but these are, you know, sort of decisions you're gonna have to make.

386
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:12,746
And then we were able to say, we want category A, B and D.

387
00:49:13,772 --> 00:49:15,233
to be part of our ask.

388
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:20,416
So I think that was a really effective way for people to understand all those variables.

389
00:49:21,196 --> 00:49:27,419
And those variables came from the survey, the buckets of what people ended up prioritizing.

390
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,660
Yes, yeah.

391
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,722
So I think that would be really helpful.

392
00:49:32,362 --> 00:49:36,765
And then there's one page where there is an asterisk that says,

393
00:49:38,103 --> 00:49:41,986
reflects preliminary information as subject to change after the results of the budget surveys.

394
00:49:42,026 --> 00:49:47,371
Does that mean this list does not integrate what we all put in our budget surveys?

395
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:49,032
Yeah, it does not.

396
00:49:51,914 --> 00:49:56,898
So that'll be a much more developed list and categorized.

397
00:49:57,299 --> 00:49:57,559
Yes.

398
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:58,720
Got it.

399
00:49:59,881 --> 00:50:01,542
I do have some more questions, but I'm happy to let somebody else.

400
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:04,385
Member McLaughlin, I think you had your hand up.

401
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,886
Then Member Russo.

402
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:08,795
Yes, then member Graham.

403
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:15,007
Yeah, sorry.

404
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:16,490
Thank you.

405
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:18,354
Thank you for the presentation.

406
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:19,556
Thank you for the visuals.

407
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,037
I think they're

408
00:50:20,356 --> 00:50:22,297
It's always good to have those, so I appreciate them.

409
00:50:23,377 --> 00:50:33,681
And I guess I just wanted to ask if we can back it up a little bit in particular for folks who are watching or will be watching the budget meetings.

410
00:50:33,922 --> 00:50:44,406
And I don't know if now is the time or if you wanna do this at the next budget meeting, but I'd sort of like to give like a broad understanding to the community of sort of,

411
00:50:45,186 --> 00:51:05,579
what has happened the past three years, and to member Graham's point a little bit about the spending down, but also, you know, we started here, we had these ESSER funds, they were used because of this, you know, this is where we're at, you know, this is going to stop at this point, and we may very well be in a decision where we have to figure out what to do with that.

412
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:10,022
And so sort of like a primer, if we will, if we could for like an intro to

413
00:51:10,629 --> 00:51:13,630
to school committee budget, I think would be really helpful.

414
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:32,095
Just again, maybe for the next meeting, since I don't think it was prepared for this meeting, but I think for people who are watching, who don't really understand, and I think we, who are maybe more familiar with the budget are talking about a lot of things that people probably are not following and in particular with ESSER funding among other things.

415
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:35,316
So I would ask if we could potentially have that.

416
00:51:36,697 --> 00:51:36,897
Yes.

417
00:51:37,257 --> 00:51:38,177
Thank you, superintendent.

418
00:51:38,957 --> 00:51:39,678
for the next meeting.

419
00:51:39,818 --> 00:51:41,060
I think that would be really helpful.

420
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:52,232
And then I wanted to ask you about also the stages in the back, the last page for the budget process and tentative timeline.

421
00:51:53,012 --> 00:51:59,920
In that explanation, if you wouldn't mind sharing what the expectation would be for the April 3rd, 10th, and May 1 meeting.

422
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:00,581
For example,

423
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:15,168
you know, April 3rd meeting, we're going to go over, you know, a broad introduction to, you know, what we're hoping, what, you know, give an outline of what's been spent, how it's been spent and what we think, you know, maybe issues moving forward.

424
00:52:15,188 --> 00:52:19,790
So it's sort of a broad picture and then what folks can maybe expect for the 10th and the 1st.

425
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,191
And again, I know this timeline is sort of tentative here.

426
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:26,473
And then I wanted to ask you, didn't we have, or don't we have to have

427
00:52:27,685 --> 00:52:31,960
a public meeting to and I know these meetings are public, but don't we have to have a meeting specifically

428
00:52:33,174 --> 00:52:37,417
Yes, the public hearing based on how our budget cows go.

429
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:52,907
If the committee chooses to go further or if you feel we get to a good point, it would either be the late May or early June meeting would be the publicly posted budget hearing.

430
00:52:53,107 --> 00:52:55,649
And that needs to be posted two weeks in advance.

431
00:52:58,431 --> 00:52:58,831
Thank you.

432
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:00,372
Can we include that in the timeline?

433
00:53:00,984 --> 00:53:05,767
please, just so folks know when they see that, if they're looking for that, I think that's super helpful, thank you.

434
00:53:06,847 --> 00:53:11,370
And then I wanted to ask you just two more questions if I could.

435
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:19,034
One is in the pie chart that is on page one, if you can explain for folks the student services at the 5.25%.

436
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:20,255
The student, which- Sorry, pie chart.

437
00:53:27,891 --> 00:53:34,074
Actually, it's FY23 budget numbers, the approximations where you had the 5.25 student services.

438
00:53:34,234 --> 00:53:38,875
So that's inclusive of athletics.

439
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,416
It's actually a more global term.

440
00:53:41,516 --> 00:53:42,077
It's inclusive of

441
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:58,599
Any services that are related to students, including athletics, and that's like 55% it's separate from the special education, which is a 25%.

442
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,101
And I can ask for some of the.

443
00:54:05,528 --> 00:54:14,370
the breakdown of the 5.25, I can get the full, I can get the full breakout and give you that listing for next week's presentation as well.

444
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:14,850
Thank you.

445
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:17,310
I'm just looking for wherever there might be some ambiguity.

446
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:22,011
I think the other things sort of speak for themselves, but that maybe doesn't for other folks.

447
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:23,332
So I appreciate that.

448
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:29,873
And then the sort of the last, okay, my last question for now was the,

449
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:36,631
the budgetary priorities, so the summer programming.

450
00:54:37,131 --> 00:54:44,317
And again, I know they're grant dependent, and I'm just wanting to ensure that we're, you know, and I'm sure we are because I know

451
00:54:45,480 --> 00:55:02,725
the central admin and sort of the way you folks are working, but I just want to ensure as we're planning that, that we're planning inclusivity and equity around the programming for the summer so that we're thinking about all of the student population, especially the most vulnerable affected by the pandemic.

452
00:55:02,745 --> 00:55:08,227
So just that's sort of more statement than a question, if that's okay.

453
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:08,647
Thank you.

454
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:09,687
Thank you.

455
00:55:14,249 --> 00:55:16,791
Member Russo, and then I actually have question two.

456
00:55:18,092 --> 00:55:18,632
Thank you, Mayor.

457
00:55:20,553 --> 00:55:25,176
I signed the warrants, but I just realized I don't think I've ever signed a warrant for water.

458
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:26,838
Do we not pay for our water?

459
00:55:26,858 --> 00:55:28,559
Does the municipality just provide it for free?

460
00:55:29,439 --> 00:55:29,860
Wonderful.

461
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,341
That's nice that I have one bill.

462
00:55:32,942 --> 00:55:39,086
And my other question was on the slide, two slides before, the areas of concern.

463
00:55:40,027 --> 00:55:46,450
I appreciate the use of the color there because these items definitely caused some alarms.

464
00:55:47,290 --> 00:56:04,377
I mean, obviously it's too soon to really talk about staffing downsizing, but in the advocate for investment, I guess I'm wondering who's advocating and with whom?

465
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:05,597
With whom?

466
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:06,058
Whom?

467
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:06,618
Yeah.

468
00:56:07,717 --> 00:56:23,667
I've never really got that stuff straight on the who and whom's, but I mean, I think it's important to advocate for investment, but I think this whole committee's part of our job is to advocate for investment and the communities and sort of everybody's responsibility.

469
00:56:23,687 --> 00:56:27,629
So I'm just wondering what is meant by that in this context?

470
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:32,212
And if I might just suggest, is it just

471
00:56:34,403 --> 00:56:38,324
try to talk to the mayor, get more money in that in that in the mayor's budget.

472
00:56:38,364 --> 00:56:39,185
Is that what that means?

473
00:56:40,445 --> 00:56:52,410
Because I don't see the the administration going and I mean, spending your time talking to your state, our state legislators, like, I just don't know what that means.

474
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,171
Just through this process.

475
00:56:58,985 --> 00:57:02,027
Again, to really look at what our needs are.

476
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:11,994
I know that I presented some of the big surprises that we weren't expecting for this year, unexpected changes or unanticipated costs.

477
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:19,580
And so I think just saying that we really do want to advocate for investment in the school system.

478
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:34,171
looking at the needs of the district, looking at the needs of all of our students, and planning for contingencies, because there are so many unexpected contingencies and things that happen within the district.

479
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:45,280
So that was just, I think it was just there to let you know that these are the areas that we're gonna try to continue to represent for the district.

480
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:45,820
Thank you.

481
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,163
Thank you, Member Russo.

482
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,621
Member Hayes.

483
00:57:53,783 --> 00:58:00,028
I was just wondering, I'm looking at the FY23 ESSER estimated budget.

484
00:58:00,388 --> 00:58:07,034
Did we hire, I thought we had hired additional adjustment counselors using ESSER, but I don't see them on here.

485
00:58:07,114 --> 00:58:10,457
So maybe I'm thinking of the behavioral specialists.

486
00:58:11,137 --> 00:58:15,200
I do see the behavioral specialists that are listed here.

487
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:26,423
I cannot say if their title was an adjustment counselor, but I can find out specifically, was it behaviorist only?

488
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:30,164
Was there behavioral specialists?

489
00:58:31,224 --> 00:58:38,247
But I think it might've been that and not an adjustment counselor, but I can follow up to find out regarding that one.

490
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:39,027
Thank you.

491
00:58:40,028 --> 00:58:41,168
And I see Ms.

492
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:45,369
Bowen shaking her head, affirming that it was behavioral specialists.

493
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,970
Behavioral specialists, thank you.

494
00:58:47,466 --> 00:58:50,128
I'm gonna let member Graham speak again, and then I have a question.

495
00:58:51,869 --> 00:59:04,419
On the page that talks about fixed cost increases, if I am reading this right, I think I have a question about the second bullet, which talks about contractual increases.

496
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:11,925
So in one place I saw a million dollars, and in here I see $3.3 million.

497
00:59:12,866 --> 00:59:14,667
Just point of information, I'm sorry, where are you?

498
00:59:15,513 --> 00:59:18,554
Um on the fixed cost increases slide looks like this.

499
00:59:19,834 --> 00:59:20,134
Hold on.

500
00:59:20,154 --> 00:59:22,134
Let me put my with like the pictures on the bottom.

501
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:22,615
Oh yeah.

502
00:59:22,635 --> 00:59:22,875
Okay.

503
00:59:22,915 --> 00:59:23,275
Thank you.

504
00:59:23,295 --> 00:59:23,455
Yep.

505
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:27,476
The happy kids.

506
00:59:29,076 --> 00:59:36,437
Is it is the increase over FY twenty-three 1 million dollars or 3.3 million dollars?

507
00:59:41,939 --> 00:59:43,659
For FY twenty

508
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:55,221
Are you asking specifically on the special education increase, which is 1 million and then contractual increases amounting to 3.3 million?

509
00:59:58,203 --> 01:00:01,765
I'm not sure, you're asking, is it a $1 million increase?

510
01:00:01,925 --> 01:00:09,430
So yeah, the personnel piece, I know special ed will go up a million and it says vendors will go up 100,000.

511
01:00:10,271 --> 01:00:12,052
But what I'm trying to understand is,

512
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:21,554
The personnel increase, is it $1 million over FY23, or is it $3.3 million over FY23?

513
01:00:22,094 --> 01:00:24,254
And when I say FY23, I mean the number on the front, 68, 994, 776.

514
01:00:25,114 --> 01:00:29,135
It's at least 3 million, which it says on the page prior to.

515
01:00:29,155 --> 01:00:39,237
It says 3 million and then 3.3, and that's because we haven't adjusted our last two budgets based on what we agreed in the contract.

516
01:00:39,986 --> 01:00:59,638
For FY24, we would need, in order to work with all of the changes and the adjustments, it would need to be in that three million for the contractual increases, I think, for all of them.

517
01:01:01,939 --> 01:01:02,820
Okay.

518
01:01:08,163 --> 01:01:13,965
And it was just confirmed it's 3.3 million, but 3.3 million is is 4.7% increase over the 68 994.

519
01:01:14,085 --> 01:01:17,065
If the contractual increases just 2.5%.

520
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:18,606
How, how does the increase.

521
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:30,549
2.5, 2.5, this year's 2.9.

522
01:01:31,069 --> 01:01:36,374
But 68,994 included an increase, right?

523
01:01:36,414 --> 01:01:38,015
So there's already increase in that number.

524
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:42,219
I guess I'm just trying to figure out, what's the real add over 68,994,776?

525
01:01:42,259 --> 01:01:44,821
Probably 4%, because the 2.5%, which was the COLA amount, that's not including steps and lanes.

526
01:01:57,429 --> 01:02:10,079
So it was like on the base, like it's, so it ends up, even though it's a 2.5% increase, it ends up feeling like it's closer to a 4% increase.

527
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:12,421
Okay, so 3.3 is the real number.

528
01:02:12,581 --> 01:02:15,503
Is the real number, and I just got that number confirmed.

529
01:02:17,031 --> 01:02:20,593
Okay, so that'd be 2.9, 0.5, 0.5 plus steps and lanes.

530
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:30,197
I don't know if that's the right number, but- The 3.3 million takes into account steps, lanes, as well as all of the other unions in addition to the MTA.

531
01:02:30,557 --> 01:02:41,042
That's where the 3.3 million- Yeah, I just think my point is all of those budgets assume some amount of increase and paid out, the money paid out of those budgets.

532
01:02:41,102 --> 01:02:41,902
I'm trying to understand

533
01:02:43,772 --> 01:02:53,154
Are we like taking the whole, are we absorbing like more than just like the increments over one from one budget to the next or not?

534
01:02:53,634 --> 01:03:01,696
That's I guess what I'm trying to understand because I mean, as it stands, if I add those things up, I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding correctly.

535
01:03:01,836 --> 01:03:04,336
Our fixed costs are going up 6% this budget.

536
01:03:10,247 --> 01:03:21,769
If I add all those numbers together and divide by 68, 99, blah, blah, blah, the fixed costs alone go up 6%.

537
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:23,249
If that's right, it's fine.

538
01:03:23,609 --> 01:03:24,110
It's fine.

539
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:32,211
That's a huge number because we haven't talked about anything else besides exactly how things are today.

540
01:03:34,551 --> 01:03:37,312
But I don't want that number to float around if it's not correct.

541
01:03:38,775 --> 01:03:41,738
So maybe we can just double check these numbers, make sure.

542
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:46,484
And that'll be something that I'll be able to definitely have for next week's presentation.

543
01:03:46,504 --> 01:03:47,785
Okay.

544
01:03:48,526 --> 01:03:49,146
Appreciate that.

545
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,470
My question revolves around the cleaning contract.

546
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:54,432
And I just want to be clear.

547
01:03:54,452 --> 01:03:58,537
It seems like we have the custodians doing the work in all of our schools.

548
01:03:59,443 --> 01:04:03,505
and there's only one or two schools that use this cleaning contract?

549
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:20,033
The McGlynn complex and the high school complex, which have the most usage, community usage, events happening, those are the two complexes that are used almost 24 seven, it feels that way.

550
01:04:20,734 --> 01:04:25,796
And so those are the two buildings that have the most usage.

551
01:04:25,936 --> 01:04:28,478
So in the evenings, we have the contract cleaners,

552
01:04:29,238 --> 01:04:38,603
that come in and do that second shift just due to the volume, the sheer volume of activities that take place.

553
01:04:39,383 --> 01:04:46,247
And the McGlynn Complex, essentially it's two schools in one, so you're talking about nearly 1,000 students.

554
01:04:47,067 --> 01:04:53,671
And the high school has 1,300 students, so it gets just the most usage, the most,

555
01:04:55,888 --> 01:04:57,349
the most rentals, etc.

556
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:59,511
The same amount of custodians in each school?

557
01:05:00,812 --> 01:05:01,673
During the day shifts?

558
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:12,161
I want to say yes, but I can get a specific number on I think there are more custodians assigned to the high school just due to the high school being as large as it is.

559
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:21,629
It's so just I guess, a thought or maybe an update we could get next week or the week after is will we be increasing based on the

560
01:05:22,264 --> 01:05:32,711
percentage increase, will we be increasing any user fees for outside agencies that use our schools to account for some of this increase in cleaning costs?

561
01:05:33,752 --> 01:05:41,037
Maybe break down of what user fees we're bringing in now, so we know that that's being covered.

562
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,841
On this topic, Member Graham and Member McLaughlin.

563
01:05:47,774 --> 01:05:55,618
can I just make a suggestion that we like totally separate the revolving accounts because all of that goes into revolving accounts.

564
01:05:56,263 --> 01:06:08,627
And I think to the point of afterschool, like none of that belongs in the conversation about 68, 996, bloody, bloody, blah, because I think it muddies the water about like what's in there and what isn't.

565
01:06:09,247 --> 01:06:23,191
I think if we can get all of this work done by May 15th, we'll have some breathing room and we could actually have the conversation around revolving accounts that I feel like we've wanted to have for a really long time and we've just never been able to have because it's always like a crunch on the budget.

566
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:25,952
But I think to your point, like if we're,

567
01:06:26,523 --> 01:06:36,128
we're going to incur additional costs like the the user fees need to go up if we're letting people use the building because the cost of letting them do that has gone up.

568
01:06:36,248 --> 01:06:41,391
So, I think and I would just like some transparency overall into our revolving accounts.

569
01:06:42,191 --> 01:06:45,733
It's like sort of broad statement and I know there's like fifteen of them.

570
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:49,976
So, it's like some more important than others but community schools,

571
01:06:51,810 --> 01:07:00,293
And it's a big one where after school, which I actually feel like we know more about than any of the rest, but there's a couple of really big ones.

572
01:07:00,354 --> 01:07:01,174
There's a pool.

573
01:07:01,314 --> 01:07:03,415
I think there's a pool one that's separate from community schools.

574
01:07:03,535 --> 01:07:08,077
I don't, whatever the big ones are, I would like to know, like, how does money flow in?

575
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:09,737
How does money flow out?

576
01:07:10,498 --> 01:07:13,999
And like, what, what is contributing to all of that?

577
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:18,961
Because we should be rate setting for all of those things, which

578
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,061
we should have the time to do if we're able to finish our budget request by May 15th.

579
01:07:24,781 --> 01:07:26,662
Member McLaughlin, then member Kratz.

580
01:07:28,062 --> 01:07:28,382
Thank you.

581
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:32,143
And just a quick question for the budget concerns.

582
01:07:33,164 --> 01:07:44,787
For the 14% increase in out of district tuition, is that because the schools have increased their tuition or is that because we have an increased number of students going out of district or is it both?

583
01:07:45,347 --> 01:07:45,787
The governor.

584
01:07:47,935 --> 01:07:51,956
Yes, that's Governor Baker signed that before he left.

585
01:07:53,056 --> 01:08:02,138
Yeah, so that's an increase based on the state and what they're doing is they want to raise their cost of living and also offer bonuses to keep staff members on board.

586
01:08:02,218 --> 01:08:07,839
So that was the increase across the board for all other district placements, except for the collaboratives.

587
01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:09,979
Okay, thank you.

588
01:08:11,759 --> 01:08:13,760
So it's not an increased number of students?

589
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:14,100
No.

590
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:14,880
Okay, thank you.

591
01:08:15,748 --> 01:08:24,230
And I'll be doing a presentation next meeting regarding out-of-district programming and our current numbers and placements for you next week.

592
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:27,470
Member Gretz.

593
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,031
Yes, thank you for the presentation.

594
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:35,912
Yep, so I was looking at the, it would be the slide for the FY budgetary priorities draft.

595
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,413
And I just had a question.

596
01:08:38,753 --> 01:08:44,134
So where there's the need and it lists out the individual needs, I'm wondering,

597
01:08:45,552 --> 01:08:50,733
Does, do the figures tie back to the slide above?

598
01:08:51,093 --> 01:09:02,916
Like, I guess I'm wondering, like, so if I'm looking at the need for, like, theater teachers, CTE expansion, how much money, you know, would we need to fill those positions?

599
01:09:03,336 --> 01:09:05,437
Or, like, these are the priorities.

600
01:09:06,717 --> 01:09:11,378
So, like, just thinking about estimates, are we gonna see that at some point?

601
01:09:11,518 --> 01:09:13,579
Or is it here, and I'm just, like, not sure where it is.

602
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:25,028
So the specific costs under draft, budgetary priorities, the draft, we have not provided official numbers.

603
01:09:25,508 --> 01:09:37,193
This was just, yes, we talked about the literacy interventionists, the reading specialists under ESSER funding, but, you know,

604
01:09:38,673 --> 01:09:45,915
additional social workers and adjustment counselors, the extended school day before and after school staff.

605
01:09:46,876 --> 01:10:02,080
We have not broken out official numbers, like how many total FTEs do we want, eight FTEs, like two at each program or whatever the number would end up being.

606
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,761
So we haven't given specific breakouts.

607
01:10:05,841 --> 01:10:10,383
It's just some of the pieces that we know we really would hope or like to see.

608
01:10:10,403 --> 01:10:31,231
So it was just kind of the restorative justice, the high school scheduling, which we talked about, and the broad array of summer offerings that we had offered last summer that we would like to continue to offer during the summer for our community.

609
01:10:33,322 --> 01:10:33,602
Thanks.

610
01:10:33,642 --> 01:10:35,123
And I just had one follow-up question.

611
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:40,585
So I'm wondering, you know, cause I know it's going to happen probably in the future.

612
01:10:41,345 --> 01:11:02,113
So like when we hear from the other departments, like the high school and the vocational school and the music program, the directors, like, will they have, you know, the budget priorities, like sometimes like I'm thinking ahead too much, but like we do get, you know, in another screen, probably in the future, just like, you know,

613
01:11:02,574 --> 01:11:09,258
their priorities and, you know, the need versus like critical, almost what Ms.

614
01:11:09,338 --> 01:11:17,582
Graham said, that was helpful having it identified, but I, I, I'm sorry, not critical, but like the category.

615
01:11:17,922 --> 01:11:18,183
Yes.

616
01:11:18,623 --> 01:11:28,248
Labeling it that way so that, you know, we can see in the cost associated with the labeling, like whether it's critical versus the category ABC and what the

617
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:33,414
So this doesn't include, yeah, this will be coming in the next meeting.

618
01:11:33,474 --> 01:11:39,281
So this doesn't include the priorities or what was listed in the budget surveys.

619
01:11:40,642 --> 01:11:41,784
This doesn't include that at all.

620
01:11:41,904 --> 01:11:43,466
All right, thanks.

621
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:45,468
Okay, so coming up in the future, thank you.

622
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:00,667
Thank you for the presentation, Dr. Edwin-Vincent.

623
01:12:00,847 --> 01:12:03,549
I think we have, I don't know if we want to put it in a form of a motion.

624
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,510
The questions are, I think you've written everything down.

625
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,032
So it's up to the committee.

626
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:12,914
I think Dr. Edwin-Vincent wrote everything down as we set it, but okay.

627
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:16,296
Is there any more questions from the floor?

628
01:12:19,758 --> 01:12:23,940
Motion adjourned by Member Graham, seconded by Member Kratz.

629
01:12:25,061 --> 01:12:25,761
All those in favor?

630
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:28,766
All those opposed, we have a 10 minute break.
