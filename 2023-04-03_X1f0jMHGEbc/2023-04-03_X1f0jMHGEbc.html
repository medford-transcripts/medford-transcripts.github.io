and it's a great cause and a great time to enjoy a fun event with your family. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=814.086s">Lastly,</a>  but also equally important in closing, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=819.611s">Passover</a>  is starting this week, beginning at sundown on Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=826.272s">Easter</a>  will follow on Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=828.573s">I</a>  would like to take this time to wish all of our families a joyful and blessed holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=837.035s">As</a>  a final reminder, there was no school this Friday, April 7th, in observance of Good Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=844.636s">Wishing</a>  you all a happy holiday season. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=847.157s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=849.582s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edwardson. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=853.265s">We</a>  have presentation on the Medford Public Schools website and mobile app. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=857.147s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=857.347s">Diane</a>  Caldwell, associate superintendent, Lisa Miller, programming and web development teacher in recognition of the following students for outstanding efforts on our Medford Public Schools website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=870.396s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=870.556s">Caldwell,</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=873.658s">The</a>  little person with the voice, if you touch, oh, there it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=876.881s">Mic's</a>  on.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=877.841s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=882.341s">So</a>  thank you, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, members of the school committee, Superintendent Dr. Maurice Vincent, for having us here to provide you with what we think is a new, improved Medford Public Schools website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=898.51s">I'm</a>  going to start by doing some introductions and acknowledging the amazing people, students, staff, administrators, who helped make this website possible for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=912.662s">And</a>  then the students will come up and say a few words, and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=916.343s">Miller</a>  will also do a presentation, a demonstration of the website's special features. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=923.005s">So</a>  first I wanted to talk to you about Molly Layden, who is our Director of Library, Media, and Technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=930.387s">Molly</a>  was so instrumental in doing the research for us and trying to find a company that met Medford Public Schools' needs, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=940.816s">talking</a>  to the directors in the content areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=946.08s">Medford</a>  vocational teacher of programming and web development, Lisa Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=949.782s">I</a>  have to say that her technology expertise is second to none. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=956.187s">And</a>  if she wasn't with us, we wouldn't be standing in front of you today. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=961.751s">So</a>  thank you to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=962.632s">Miller.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=969.332s">George</a>  Tufas is with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=971.053s">George,</a>  give us a wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=973.115s">So</a>  some of you from City Hall might already know George because he's doing his internship here at Medford City Hall, and he actually helped launch Final Sight here, but he helped us first because we started with him a little bit ago, a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=990.108s">Kevin</a>  Gusmeo, Kevin, wave for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=993.459s">Kevin</a>  is the team leader, the team manager in Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=997.943s">Miller's</a>  classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=999.665s">And</a>  he's sort of employed a couple of other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1002.507s">And</a>  when pages come in to be edited or added or deleted, whatever it happens to be, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1009.234s">Miller</a>  will say, Kevin, will you take care of this for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1011.496s">So</a>  Kevin, thank you for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1016.052s">Daniel</a>  Skeppel is not with us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1018.153s">Daniel</a>  is currently a freshman at the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1023.877s">So</a>  Kevin, if you're watching, hello, and I'd like to acknowledge the work that you did on the website as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1031.082s">Tenzing</a>  Lobden isn't here with us tonight, but I would like to acknowledge his work with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1037.106s">But</a>  Babav Sani is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1039.528s">Babav,</a>  give us a wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1042.219s">And</a>  he's worked hard on the website this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1047.282s">I'd</a>  also like to just go down and I hope you can bear with me as I acknowledge other people, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1054.266s">Obviously</a>  the school committee, we would not be able to have done all of our work without your cooperation and your collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1061.97s">So</a>  thank you so much for what you've done for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1064.878s">the</a>  administrators, starting with central administration with Dr. Vincent, but I don't know how many meetings I've had with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1072.899s">Galussi,</a>  Dr. Cushing, and Joan Bowen herself will tell you, I was in her office numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1078.901s">It</a>  was so important for me to make sure, especially for special education and pupil services, that what we put up on the website was correct information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1088.802s">So</a>  I'd like to thank you for your help with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1093.543s">We</a>  have a posting team in Medford now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1096.164s">Each</a>  one of our schools has a posting person that takes care of the calendar for the school, as well as the school news. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1105.948s">So</a>  I'd like to thank Jen Conte at the Brooks Elementary School, Allison Guilmette at the Missituk Elementary, Liza Goldman at the Roberts Elementary, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1117.493s">Courtney</a>  Bell does work for us at both the McGlynn Elementary and the McGlynn Middle School, Azita Poli-Bacon at the Andrews Middle School, Rebecca McGinnis and Maria Dorsey at Medford High School, Medford Vocational and the Curtis Tufts School. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1134.481s">So</a>  a big thank you to those teachers who have been working with us this past year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1141.451s">I'm</a>  not sure if you know Kat Darnell. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1143.173s">She</a>  has worked to do the videos of each of the principals and the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1150.519s">So</a>  I'd like to thank Kat Darnell. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1152.881s">Our</a>  CCSR students are everywhere, as you well know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1156.324s">So</a>  they did a lot of photos for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1158.959s">Mr.</a>  Hesser and his class, I have a special place in my heart for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1162.881s">We</a>  took the vocational bus or van out, and we went to each and every one of the schools, took photos, we used drones, which was really kind of fun, of the teachers, the administrators, so that we had updated pictures as well as of the inside and the outsides of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1185.1s">Mr.</a>  Spagnola, once we had all our photos taken, Mr. Spagnola and Mr. John Spagnola and the classroom of students then took those pictures and cropped them and sent them off to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1197.331s">Miller</a>  and her students to get onto our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1201.775s">And</a>  I'll just say it one more time, this couldn't have been done without the assistance of Molly Layden and Lisa Miller. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1208.721s">So</a>  again, thank you so much for what you have done for us.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1214.98s">So</a>  I'm going to begin at the beginning.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1218.882s">Our</a>  goal, after we looked at the website, was to improve communication with our families, with students, staff, and the community by creating an informative, accessible, easy to navigate, and appealing website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1237.025s">We</a>  began the conversation around fall of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1241.146s">I</a>  actually have to acknowledge Dave Murphy because I worked very closely with him and we would meet often to make sure we were on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1252.11s">We</a>  looked at our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1254.031s">We</a>  knew that it needed edits, updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1256.932s">There</a>  were broken links. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1258.672s">We</a>  needed to streamline. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1259.953s">We</a>  looked at our resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1262.154s">We</a>  needed navigation improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1264.494s">It</a>  had to be user-friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1266.593s">more</a>  appealing staff directory changes and, you know, oftentimes I would look at the staff directory if I could find it on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1275.357s">And</a>  there were people who were retired resigned and some who had passed away, and yet still were on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1283.247s">We</a>  needed to update our policies that you've been working on, current events information, delete obsolete information, get better images. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1293.795s">But</a>  one thing I think that Lisa, Molly and I agreed upon is we wanted more of our students' pictures, photos on the website because it is all about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1305.645s">So</a>  we were happy to get lots of photos. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1308.407s">So</a>  that's where it began. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1311.547s">We</a>  started our research. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1313.669s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1313.909s">Layden</a>  was tasked to do this research. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1316.652s">So</a>  on her technology listserv, she had discussions with her tech directors about reliability, accessibility, tech support. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1329.303s">And</a>  so we came up with four different companies, edLeo, Educational Network, Catapult, and Finalsight. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1338.871s">So</a>  our focus was to look at the designs that these four companies had. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1344.214s">Maintenance</a>  was really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1345.675s">As</a>  you well know that some of the maintenance wasn't happening with our old website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1350.157s">We</a>  wanted to keep it up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1352.698s">Accessibility</a>  was extremely important, whether it was for our EL families or for our special education families. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1361.663s">We</a>  looked at news features, the payment system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1365.525s">We</a>  wanted to make sure that we had a consistent payment system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1369.249s">And</a>  right now we are using one, so I'm happy that we have BlueSnap on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1375.357s">Social</a>  media feeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1377.38s">So</a>  we looked at having two for the district and then two for each and every school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1384.449s">Cloud</a>  storage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1386.277s">forms</a>  integration, content management, and a mobile app, which I'm happy to say, we have our mobile app up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1395.32s">So</a>  you can go to your app store and for parents, they can, if you're looking just to go to the Roberts Elementary or the Andrews Middle School, you can put that on your mobile app now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1406.484s">After</a>  all of our research and discussions and Zooms and conversations with these companies, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1412.841s">Final</a>  Sight was the company that could deliver everything we were looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1418.724s">So</a>  when we decided on Final Sight, we then went to the different districts to see what they looked like, North Andover, Hockington, Norton, and Brockton. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1429.49s">And</a>  we decided that we would take the best from each of them and incorporate them into Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1439.229s">So</a>  one of my favorite days was when we did the theme selection. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1443.472s">George,</a>  Kevin, and Daniel were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1446.734s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1447.075s">Miller</a>  said to the students, well, you need to present to central administration and to the principals what your favorite theme is from final site. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1457.902s">Not</a>  a problem for these young men. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1460.164s">They</a>  got together and they chose what was good for them, what they liked. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1465.595s">And</a>  they just get up, and I think there was a secret, I don't know if it, what did we use for a, not secret ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1474.659s">Was</a>  it Survey Monkey or something? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1480.181s">Google</a>  Forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1481.462s">So</a>  each of our administrators chose what they thought the best theme for Metro Public Schools was, and that's how we came up with what we have today. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1493.566s">We</a>  were then, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1495.322s">tasked</a>  with creating district and school sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1499.163s">This</a>  wasn't easy because we were trying to take the information that we knew was important from our current site and then add information to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1510.445s">I</a>  was working with the superintendent and the assistant superintendents on a regular basis and with all the principals to discuss what they wanted their school site to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1522.747s">So</a>  my thanks obviously go to <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1525.103s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1525.323s">Galusi,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1526.083s">Bowen,</a>  and Dr. Cushing once again for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1530.224s">One</a>  thing we didn't know when we started this project, or at least I'll speak for myself, one thing I didn't know was that we had eight additional websites within Medford Public Schools, and I was really surprised by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1543.748s">One</a>  of them is an amazing website created by a student, the CCSR website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1548.47s">If</a>  you take a look at that, one of our kids did that from a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1552.651s">That</a>  is still up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1554.409s">Our</a>  athletics website is still up and running and we decided that that would be in our phase two because it was too much to put in for this current year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1565.674s">But</a>  the counseling had a website, the Metro Family Network, the speech and language, a lot of different websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1571.356s">So</a>  we were able to fold in those websites for the most part into the new Metro Public Schools website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1579.46s">One</a>  of the interesting things last summer with <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1582.103s">especially</a>  George and Kevin was, we were working throughout the summer, and George goes to Greece every summer with his family who are here, so thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1591.638s">So</a>  we gave George work to do, but we didn't expect him to do a lot, it was his vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1597.463s">But</a>  he would email, text, let us know, okay, I'm done with that, what else do you need me to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1603.407s">And</a>  this was during his vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1605.649s">And</a>  Kevin went to, was it Acapulco or Mexico, and then he went to Florida. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1611.414s">And</a>  in the middle of his vacation, he would email Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1614.316s">Miller</a>  and myself and say, I'm done with this project, what's next? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1618.119s">So</a>  the boys, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1620.228s">have</a>  gone above and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1621.969s">And</a>  for me, this is so amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1624.23s">So</a>  thanks so much, guys, for doing what you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1629.133s">We</a>  still have ongoing work on the staff directory that needs to be updated four times a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1636.958s">We</a>  need to edit our content areas, which we're constantly doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1642.889s">creating</a>  easy to find school committee agendas, archived information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1648.211s">I</a>  don't know about you, but anytime I tried to find out what was going on in the school committee, it took me probably five to eight minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1656.013s">And</a>  now it doesn't anymore because you have your own tab. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1659.675s">You</a>  just click on it and it says agenda and we get right to the minutes after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1664.876s">So</a>  I'm happy that at least I can get continued, even though I'm not really here, I've retired, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1670.748s">I</a>  can, I still watch school committee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1673.371s">So,</a>  and our consistent payment system to me was really important as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1678.737s">So,</a>  I thank you for your time for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1681.159s">And</a>  now I'd like to take a moment to introduce Kevin, who's going to begin with accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1688.727s">Come</a>  on up, Kevin.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1696.24s">Before</a>  I start, I just wanted to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1698.961s">Miller,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1700.261s">Codwell,</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1700.902s">Layden</a>  for their opportunity that they gave me to work on this website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1705.083s">So</a>  I'm Kevin. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1706.623s">I'm</a>  a senior in the programming and web development shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1709.604s">I'm</a>  also the student manager of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1713.626s">To</a>  me, the most important aspect of this website has been accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1717.907s">And</a>  it's something that we have prioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1721.229s">So</a>  this school district is a very diverse school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1724.572s">And</a>  with that respectfully, there's a lot of languages being spoken by students, faculty, and parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1731.618s">So</a>  it was of utmost importance to us that we make the website multilingual. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1736.122s">And</a>  that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1737.383s">And</a>  we do that through WEGLOC, which is a translation service built into our website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1742.267s">It's</a>  very easy to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1743.288s">You</a>  just click on the language that you want to be translated and the page gets translated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1749.075s">I</a>  also wanted to mention too that our website is screen reader friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1753.479s">Every</a>  link has a title, every image has an alt text, and we pull text out of images so that they can be screen read and translated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1762.687s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1769.994s">I've</a>  been neglected to mention he's going to the UMass Lowell in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1774.077s">Thank</a>  you, Kevin. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1776.633s">Vavav,</a>  can you come up, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1778.194s">Vavav</a>  was interested in communication.</p>

    <p>[Saini]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1782.756s">Hello,</a>  my name is Vavav Saini, and I also want to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1786.718s">Caldwell</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1787.319s">Miller</a>  for giving me the opportunity to work on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1789.98s">I'm</a>  a senior at the program web development shop in Bedford High School, and what I learned and love about the website work is communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1796.844s">I</a>  think I learned how to email more professionally, communicate with people in person online, and how to convey messages in various types of posts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1805.612s">I</a>  think communication is a very valuable skills because you can really change the outcome of new posts comes out or just talking to someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1812.414s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1817.916s">And</a>  Baboff is off to the University of Mass in Boston, correct?</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1823.137s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1823.677s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1824.638s">George,</a>  come on up.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1830.316s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1830.916s">Before</a>  I start, I want to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1832.537s">Miller</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1832.938s">Caldwell</a>  for the opportunity they gave me to work on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1835.639s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1836.019s">I'm</a>  George Tufas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1836.68s">If</a>  you didn't know already, I worked at Medford City Hall as a website intern. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1841.203s">And</a>  me and the mayor's office team successfully launched, redesigned, and published the website for Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1848.067s">My</a>  favorite part of working at Medford Public Schools website was going down with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1852.95s">Caldwell</a>  to different departments and basically sitting with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1859.4s">going</a>  through their part of the page as part of their site and seeing if information needed to go away or we have to put more new information in. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1867.047s">It</a>  was basically a one-on-one and it made the process more easier, more friendlier for the department head. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1874.615s">Thank</a>  you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1875.396s">And</a>  once again, thank you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1876.236s">Caldwell</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1877.337s">Miller.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1883.24s">George</a>  is off to UMass, Lowell next year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1887.683s">I</a>  think they underplay who they really are because when work comes into Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1892.146s">Miller,</a>  because that's where it comes, she just gives it to the students and they know what to do at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1899.791s">And</a>  I know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1900.311s">Miller</a>  is working on hopefully continuing this process in the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1905.155s">All</a>  right, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1906.175s">Miller,</a>  would you please come up and do a demonstration?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1919.229s">mind.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1919.389s">That</a>  was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1920.329s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1921.57s">So</a>  I would like to first thank Miss Caldwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1924.931s">I'm</a>  sure that building a website was not her retirement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1929.812s">And</a>  she has stepped up and gone way beyond all, you know, I don't know, we had high expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1936.855s">So</a>  not, you know, but <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1938.394s">I</a>  think she's done a phenomenal job, and it's been really a pleasure working with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1942.817s">And</a>  it's, it's been fun to see you grow as a website developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1950.403s">I'd</a>  also like to just say thank you to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1954.126s">I</a>  also think that they <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1957.088s">are</a>  rather humble. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1958.128s">They</a>  have done a phenomenal job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1960.949s">They</a>  are some of the most professional web developers I've worked with at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1965.09s">I</a>  have complete confidence in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1968.091s">When</a>  something comes in, I'll say, oh, just send an email to so-and-so. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1972.312s">And</a>  they've really just stepped up to the task. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1976.434s">They</a>  take their responsibilities extremely seriously and address things like the accessibility issues, making sure that all the images have <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1986.118s">alt</a>  text and that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1987.719s">So</a>  I have really been impressed and I'm a very proud teacher of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=1992.361s">So</a>  with that, I'd like to just go ahead and highlight a couple of the features of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2000.044s">I'm</a>  hoping that most people here have already seen the website, but it is structured differently than websites that we've had in the past in the sense that there is the district site and then each school has its own <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2013.904s">site</a>  that can be accessed through the top navigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2017.788s">The</a>  design of the website is such that each school has its own website and the district has a website, but it's all a similar design so that there's a consistency across the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2029.998s">So</a>  you feel like you haven't really left the site, but each school has its own photos. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2035.823s">The</a>  homepage has the slideshow. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2038.629s">The</a>  quick links, these would be the same for all but things for like school meals, everybody checks the school meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2043.864s">That's</a>  one of our, our big sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2048.464s">We</a>  have a video of the principals and then the news and the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2056.248s">It's</a>  been really great having people at the schools, posting news, updating the school calendars, having these up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2065.273s">And</a>  I'm hoping that it's been a service to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2072.136s">One</a>  of the things that I think is really important about the website, as Caldwell mentioned this, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2077.284s">The</a>  staff directory, we do have a staff directory that the staff information is stored in a database. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2083.09s">We</a>  can come here under the about go to staff directory. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2089.316s">This</a>  would be the entire staff directory that can be filtered based on school or department name, but that same information we use to <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2099.847s">Actually,</a>  this would just be the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2101.167s">If</a>  it was on the district, it would be the entire district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2103.848s">The</a>  schools have theirs, as well as each department or the nursing staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2109.19s">And</a>  it all is pulled from the same database. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2111.351s">So</a>  we're really hoping that we don't have that obsolete information where some random name gets left or part of the site gets updated, but another part doesn't, because we're working off a common database for the directories. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2127.458s">It</a>  has you know all of the academics and departments and stuff one of the things so that I wanted to, I'm not going to go through all of the website but there's a couple things I wanted to highlight, because I find. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2138.413s">One</a>  of the things I've really enjoyed seeing is that the website get used more and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2142.275s">And</a>  so we've had ideas come in from the community of staff at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2147.798s">And</a>  so I just want to go to the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2150.9s">And</a>  so one of the things that I think is great is Suzanne Fee has come up with the idea of having art galleries at each of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2159.284s">And</a>  so we now have <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2163.544s">And</a>  we were able to accommodate this, the students implemented this, then trained Ms., you know, gave a, did some professional development for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2170.148s">P</a>  about how to actually add all the images. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2172.69s">So</a>  each gallery, each school has a gallery. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2176.332s">If</a>  we were to go to the high school, there are different collections that can be viewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2183.036s">If</a>  we wanted to look at the most recent one. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2186.172s">So</a>  this is an idea that I think is wonderful because people have seen the website and have said, ah, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2192.736s">And</a>  people are using it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2194.237s">What</a>  could I do to add to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2196.859s">And</a>  so this would be, I think, a great example of that happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2202.502s">We</a>  also have a nursing blog now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2204.423s">So</a>  the nursing staff approached us and said, could we do something, have a monthly nursing blog? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2215.222s">And</a>  so now we have, come down here.</p>

    <p>[Miller]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2218.084s">Is</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2225.248s">There's</a>  an emergency out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2236.174s">Where</a>  do we put the nursing blog? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2237.535s">Is</a>  it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2237.835s">I</a>  thought it was under health services, but I know Kevin will know. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2243.331s">Is</a>  it student life, or do you know where the nursing blog went?</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2249.975s">Yeah,</a>  so I thought it was under, yeah.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2260.641s">Anyway,</a>  the idea is really that people are seeing the website and thinking about what can be added to it, and I've been really inspired by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2271.667s">I</a>  think we're going to go ahead and go. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2274.968s">Thanks,</a>  Kevin. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2275.609s">I'm</a>  going to go back to the slide presentation, because there's a little bit of information I wanted to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2283.892s">Some</a>  of the things like scholarships, we've been working with guidance, and they've said, you know, like, well, we could put the scholarship information there or community service information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2292.216s">So</a>  we use the boards to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2295.177s">students</a>  are doing that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2296.958s">And</a>  then I just wanted to show you the Google Analytics from the website usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2304.523s">The</a>  one on the upper right is for the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2308.366s">You</a>  can see it's fairly flat, flat, flat until about August when we launched. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2313.249s">And</a>  that's when you kind of get the <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2315.851s">as</a>  George says, the heartbeat going up and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2319.855s">It</a>  is used a lot more during weekdays and weekends, so that's kind of where the up and down comes from. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2325.541s">You</a>  can see that there's been 114,000 visitors to the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2332.984s">in</a>  the last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2335.145s">If</a>  you look at the lower one, I don't know if you can see it with the captions over it, but that is a 10-day period. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2342.23s">Typically</a>  on a given school day, slightly over 1,000 people a day visit the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2348.154s">It's</a>  lower than that, usually around 500 on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2354.398s">The</a>  most visited pages are the homepage, school brains, the printable school calendar, breakfast and lunch menu, staff portal, and staff directory. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2363.328s">are</a>  currently most visited pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2368.365s">And</a>  then as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2369.786s">Caldwell</a>  said, the very newest thing that just happened is the mobile app is now available. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2375.528s">It's</a>  done through final site as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2378.429s">It</a>  is an app that pulls data from the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2383.33s">So</a>  when we post news, it automatically gets pulled into the app. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2387.152s">When</a>  we post events on the calendar, it automatically gets pulled into the app. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2393.014s">There's</a>  also links to the website for things like, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2396.895s">the</a>  lunch menu and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2399.476s">It</a>  is just available, I think last Thursday was the first day, it is available both in the Play Store and the App Store. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2407.618s">There</a>  might be some quirks to it still, it's new and there's a couple things we need to work on with Final Sight, but it is available for download right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2417.293s">One</a>  of the things that's really nice is you're able to filter by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2420.335s">So</a>  if you have a student at the Missittuck and the high school, you'll just get them, you can filter it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2425.077s">So</a>  you just get the information from the Missittuck and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2429.82s">So</a>  that's been very exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2432.821s">And</a>  then there's all the thank yous. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2435.162s">And</a>  I think Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2435.743s">Caldwell</a>  has already done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2437.484s">So</a>  I would like to thank you for listening and a wonderful website team here.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2452.128s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2453.248s">Actually,</a>  Member Ruseau was first, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2455.709s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[yB-9Wmg_zjs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2456.61s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2456.95s">This</a>  is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2458.79s">As</a>  soon as it was available, I was all over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2461.591s">I'm</a>  very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2462.472s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2463.152s">I'm</a>  curious, what are the big outstanding challenges? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2471.275s">In</a>  particular, I'm wondering about how we implemented search. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2476.56s">You</a>  know, is it just all Google? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2478.781s">And</a>  is it connected to everything properly? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2481.103s">Because</a>  I know that Google sells a lot of stuff and nothing's cheap from Google.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2485.886s">So</a>  we are using a final site search.</p>

    <p>[yB-9Wmg_zjs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2488.368s">So</a>  like, if I, if somebody creates a Google Doc, and it's just automatically available through final site search, how do... So if you had a link in a post that was to a Google Doc, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2505.319s">Yeah,</a>  I'm just thinking about, for instance, the example of the school committee agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2511.201s">Google</a>  Docs are used to create the agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2514.282s">Do</a>  they all have to be published and uploaded into the cloud for final site to even know they exist?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2520.104s">So</a>  I think that we're posting everything as PDFs right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2522.785s">So</a>  the agendas are PDFs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2524.126s">So</a>  those aren't really searchable.</p>

    <p>[yB-9Wmg_zjs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2528.087s">That</a>  was my question, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2528.987s">Is</a>  it not searchable?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2530.248s">So</a>  the agendas are not really searchable, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2533.988s">PDFs</a>  are sort of going through a transition time right now where there are some PDF formats that are a little bit more searchable than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2541.11s">But</a>  in general, we don't think of them as searchable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2544.73s">So</a>  the agendas would not be, but if it was deemed something important, we could tag them with certain categories or tags if there was like certain things we wanted that we then would be able to search for through the final site search on the website.</p>

    <p>[yB-9Wmg_zjs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2561.112s">It's</a>  a lot of work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2562.432s">Well,</a>  I mean, it's, somebody would have to tell, we wouldn't probably do it ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2566.473s">Somebody</a>  would have to say, oh, this should be tagged.</p>

    <p>[yB-9Wmg_zjs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2568.333s">But</a>  like all of tonight's many PDFs won't be, like if you went to the search, you won't find anything that's in there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2578.035s">You</a>  wouldn't find the content. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2579.455s">Like</a>  if you were looking for, if there, you know, if the word banana was in one of the documents and you search for banana, you wouldn't find that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2588.417s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[yB-9Wmg_zjs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2588.917s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2589.397s">Did</a>  you want to?</p>

    <p>[yB-9Wmg_zjs_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2590.899s">Um,</a>  I, I don't actually know what I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2594.561s">I</a>  think that, you know, you know, there's obviously a hazard of connecting a search tool directly up to all of our Google accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2603.105s">That</a>  could be <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2604.67s">you</a>  know, you're trying to draft something and somebody can just search and read the next school committee agenda before you've even published it or something.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2611.916s">But</a>  um, yeah, so I think that that's not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2615.699s">I</a>  mean, the other thing in this is separate than from the school committee stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2619.662s">If</a>  we're getting information for news posts, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2624.586s">If</a>  there's information like the date and the time and the location that's embedded in a PDF or a JPEG image, the students will usually pull that information out, display the image, have that important text underneath it so that it can be translated using our translation tools, screen read for somebody who's using a screen reader, and it's searchable then using the search tool on the website.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2655.862s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2658.886s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2660.227s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2661.188s">This</a>  looks really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2662.37s">I</a>  love the clean design. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2664.312s">It's</a>  really, and I'm super excited about the accessibility and the all text and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2669.238s">So</a>  thank you guys very much for <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2671.089s">being</a>  so conscientious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2673.59s">And</a>  I guess I'm wondering, does that, so to member Ruseau's point about the PDFs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2680.214s">So</a>  if the agendas are not in a searchable PDF format, are they not able to be translated?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2688.158s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2688.779s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2689.559s">So</a>  then we might want to think about that just in terms of translation access, because it's actually one of the things we were talking about at a previous meeting about having our materials translated. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2698.684s">So</a>  I don't know what that involves, but <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2701.574s">it's</a>  just something to consider because it is something that we've been talking about in terms of, and so is that the same for policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2707.66s">So</a>  the policy handbook, is that a PDF as well, or is that searchable?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2713.806s">I</a>  am not sure about that, I'd have to check.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2715.588s">Okay,</a>  if we could, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2717.109s">Because</a>  same thing, I think if people want to know what policy is on something, if they could search for it, that's great, and or have it translated is fantastic.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2726.365s">Yeah,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2727.306s">And</a>  I would love to see going forward there being more of a district wide strategy about documents, being able to be translated, being able to be screen read. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2737.272s">Yeah,</a>  have a consistent format that we would like to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2740.173s">So</a>  I would love to work with anybody who would like to do that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2742.735s">Okay,</a>  so then. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2744.316s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2745.016s">So</a>  it's really about thinking about how to be consistent with the format.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2747.958s">Yeah,</a>  it sounds like okay, and and having that format be one that we can use for screen readers and translation.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2754.904s">Oh,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2755.464s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2755.704s">Maybe</a>  that's something we can talk about is in terms of policy, um, around that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2759.486s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2760.086s">And</a>  then, um, I wanted to ask, so since all of these fantastic students are going on to, uh, their next careers and thankfully with the website that they can show for the work that they've been doing on their, uh, resume, which is excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2775.192s">Uh,</a>  I'm wondering about sustainability and the plan for the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2779.353s">I</a>  know that you said that there's a phase, additional phases. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2782.586s">that</a>  you're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2783.407s">So</a>  if you guys wouldn't mind sharing a little bit about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2786.468s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2786.648s">So</a>  I think, I mean, part of this will be depend on the director of communications and how that role plays out. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2794.172s">I</a>  am currently trying to recruit some students, train them this year, have them be involved in training, providing guidance to some younger students who will then take over at least the student website team aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2808.159s">I</a>  think that we need to work on, you know, will the, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2812.671s">Schools</a>  continue to be able to have people in them that can post news and update their calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2819.096s">So</a>  that would be something that hopefully we can move, you know, can continue next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2825.04s">There</a>  are bigger tasks, things like, do we want to use the final site module for athletics? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2831.545s">That's</a>  a separate module. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2832.706s">There'd</a>  be separate costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2834.767s">Currently,</a>  we have not really fully incorporated athletics into the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2838.11s">So</a>  that would be something that we could consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2841.694s">but</a>  there is cost and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2845.175s">Somebody</a>  has to do it, there's a cost to final site.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2848.816s">Thank</a>  you for mentioning that because that made me wonder also, I wanted to just ask about the pay portal. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2855.078s">So</a>  does that, what does that pay portal work for? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2857.278s">So</a>  would that work for, for example, like the summer fun camp when people are signing up for summer fun? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2861.74s">Yeah,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2862.48s">So</a>  we currently, I think that they're just starting to use it for some of the MBTA passes through the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2868.721s">They</a>  used it for- <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2871.388s">Athletics</a>  has been used.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2872.509s">Oh,</a>  athletics is using. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2873.49s">Oh,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2873.79s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2874.13s">So</a>  that's, that is that aspect of athletics is, is happening.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2878.273s">Community</a>  schools.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2881.375s">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2881.816s">The</a>  AP exams were paid for through the pay portal and summer school.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2888.881s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2893.925s">Will</a>  community schools be added? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2895.206s">Do</a>  we know for the pay portal?</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2896.407s">We</a>  can look into that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2897.387s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2897.648s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2898.408s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2899.329s">Excellent</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2900.109s">You</a>  guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2900.51s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[kZGTRaqmFyM_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2903.217s">Member</a>  Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2904.358s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2904.779s">Yeah,</a>  I think there's a lot of places where if we are going to adopt a pay portal like presuming that it has all the appropriate safeguards in place that we should be looking at all the places where we ask families to send money. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2921.533s">like</a>  lost library books, cash flows in to the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2927.838s">And</a>  I think it has to go to city hall to come back to be able to buy and replace the book. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2932.803s">So</a>  I'm hoping that if we can really get to a single pay portal for everything that has to do with our schools, it would, it would be a really glorious day for everybody, I think, because I think parents just are like, where do you want me to go? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2948.596s">What</a>  do you want me to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2949.889s">It</a>  would be nice if all of that stuff was in one place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2953.772s">So,</a>  and I think on the topic of athletics that was that was a list on my list of questions for you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2960.258s">I</a>  would like to see athletics be pulled into the mainstream of this website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2965.646s">I</a>  think athletics is a critical part of what we do at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2970.068s">And</a>  lots of people want to know about our athletics teams, not just our athletics teams, by the way, all the teams that we have, all of our extracurriculars, but it's really sort of hard to find them right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2982.895s">And</a>  the track team was here a few weeks ago and in going back and forth, the coach has done a really wonderful job maintaining his own website <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=2992.574s">for</a>  the track team, which is great, but that is a ton of work on him that is over and above all of his other coaching responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3001.178s">So</a>  I'd like to see there be a better mechanism for the athletics teams and any of the teams that have a lot of activity to be able to tell the community what they're all about on a website that could be something that meets their needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3014.124s">So</a>  I do think that is worth looking into, not just for athletics, but for athletics in any of the clubs like the ethics team <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3022.219s">and</a>  all the others. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3024.4s">And</a>  then I guess my final question is whether you have found and decommissioned all of the other versions of the website, because every now and then I go searching for something, and I land somewhere that's quite old. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3038.085s">So</a>  I'm just curious, how can we shut them down in a permanent way so that there's only one place to go?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3045.747s">So</a>  as you've noticed, they are not decommissioned completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3048.779s">They</a>  are redirected to our website, but some of those deep buried documents still show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3057.243s">And</a>  so I think that that, you know, there's been a while where we've been a little bit hesitant, especially early on, because we weren't sure if there were still documents there that we needed access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3067.368s">I</a>  think probably the time has come that we should be permissioned.</p>

    <p>[kZGTRaqmFyM_SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3070.726s">Every</a>  now and then, I land on an old website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3072.466s">I'm</a>  like, how did I get here? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3075.647s">I</a>  didn't think I was looking for anything that obscure but I think to my colleague's point, the last thing I'll say is we get a lot of questions about how to find school committee documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3084.588s">So,</a>  I will put a resolution on the agenda for us to think about at a future meeting in terms of how we can be better connected to the work that you all are doing and start to address some of the feedback that we get about how to find our documents, where to go, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3101.518s">you</a>  know, and sort of all of those, that sort of realm of questions that we get from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3106.64s">So</a>  I will do that for a future meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3108.16s">That'd</a>  be great.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3109.181s">We</a>  would love to work with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3110.661s">We</a>  tried to take the content from the old site, organize it the best we could, but it's a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3116.123s">I</a>  think that it would be great to work with you and to be able to move it even farther forward.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3121.245s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3121.565s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3122.626s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3124.383s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3125.084s">Yes,</a>  thank you very much and thank you to the students for all your help and it's it's really it's a it's dramatic improvement from the other website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3133.555s">So</a>  I downloaded the app last night and <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3136.5s">I'm</a>  very lazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3137.621s">I</a>  don't like to turn my computer on. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3138.801s">I</a>  always want to use an app. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3139.802s">So</a>  I was really happy to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3141.963s">And</a>  I just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3144.525s">Will</a>  we be able to see all the same information on the app? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3148.147s">I</a>  know you're still in the process of building it and getting it ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3151.989s">So</a>  at one point, will you have to, can you use the app for everything or will you have to still go on the website onto a computer? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3160.835s">Will</a>  they have the same exact information, the app and the actual computer or desktop?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3166.257s">So</a>  the app will only have access to the staff directory, the news, the events, and links to special sites that we've highlighted, like school grades, lunch menu. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3179.949s">The</a>  website, though, is responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3182.57s">And</a>  so if you were to go into your web browser on your phone, you would have access to the full website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3188.292s">And</a>  so it's not going to pull in all of the hundreds of pages that are on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3193.514s">It</a>  just highlights those things that are sort of changing, like I said, events and calendar stuff and lunch menus. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3198.815s">But</a>  one of the things that we've tried very hard to do is make sure that the website is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3207.018s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3207.518s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3208.259s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3210.984s">Thank</a>  you, thank you for your hard work.</p>

    <p>[Caldwell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3213.746s">At</a>  some point, Mayor, we'd like to get a photo of the school committee without their masks on, because what I have, what we have is you with your mask, so we could do that tonight if you would like.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3227.893s">With</a>  the gentleman that helps with the website, I think there'll be a great picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3231.656s">Oh,</a>  Mia's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3232.756s">Oh,</a>  Mia's not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3234.117s">Yeah,</a>  we'll do that anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3235.918s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3237.019s">Gotcha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3237.359s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3241.158s">just</a>  going to do it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3242.138s">So</a>  thank you gentlemen for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3244.88s">I'm</a>  going to turn it over to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3246.62s">We</a>  have citations for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3248.761s">There's</a>  a way to say thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3251.182s">Yes,</a>  so we are really, really excited and I want to recognize you officially. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3257.565s">First,</a>  your two members of the team that are in absentia, Daniel Skeppel and <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3269.286s">Tenzing</a>  lobbed in so we know that they can't be with us today but we still wanted to recognize them officially. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3276.735s">And</a>  we have certificates. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3279.739s">So</a>  the first certificate that I will read certificate of recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3284.525s">This</a>  certificate is proudly presented for your extraordinary contributions to our district website. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3291.128s">Kevin</a>  Guzmayo, we are celebrating you because you did more, did it better and always exceeded our expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3300.011s">And</a>  so it's signed by the school committee and myself, the superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3305.493s">We</a>  wanna thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3308.434s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3308.674s">Caldwell,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3309.955s">Layden</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3311.075s">Miller</a>  as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3312.876s">So</a>  you'll each get a certificate. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3315.619s">Kevin</a>  Guzmayo, George Tufas, and Babar Sani. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3321.165s">Please</a>  come forward.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3449.622s">Next</a>  up we have recommendation to approve submission of Massachusetts School Building Authority, MSBA core program statement of interest, SOI application. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3459.834s">Dr.</a>  Marice Edouard-Vincent, superintendent.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3464.319s">Good</a>  evening again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3468.197s">As</a>  you know, last year we went through a very intensive process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3474.042s">And</a>  unfortunately at the end of that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3477.845s">We</a>  weren't able to advance to the next phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3484.029s">The</a>  time has come, and we are reapplying as a district to MSBA the Massachusetts school building authority for the core program and we are resubmitting our statement of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3496.462s">And</a>  so I come before this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3499.365s">As</a>  an official requirement to ask you to support our statement of interest to the MSBA core program. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3507.852s">And</a>  I attach the additional communication that we also shared with the Medford City Council, and I am expected to go before their body next week on Tuesday, April 11 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3522.582s">and</a>  the deadline for resubmission to MSBA is next week as well on April 14th.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3573.508s">I</a>  also would just like to invite any of the members who would like to come join me next week when I present the MSBA to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3583.932s">If</a>  your schedule permits, you're more than welcome to be part of that official request because we need a vote from the city council as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3592.035s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3592.895s">Thanks,</a>  and I hope that, I'm sure that will go very smoothly <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3596.343s">MSBA</a>  likes to see that the whole city government is supportive of this and excited to move forward and ready and willing to ask our residents to support this endeavor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3606.549s">So</a>  I'm sure that will go wonderfully. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3610.09s">Roll</a>  call vote, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3645.916s">Yes,</a>  good afternoon, or good evening, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3649.459s">So</a>  this presentation right now is to just share that we are at a crossroads where we have three principalships available or open at the same exact time. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3662.149s">And</a>  so we have the Roberts Elementary School, we have the Andrews Middle School, and we have Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3671.696s">So</a>  we have posted all three jobs and the application process is open for all of the schools until Friday, April, or until April 5th, excuse me, Wednesday, April 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3692.449s">We</a>  had families or members of the community, parents and caregivers sign up, and every single school community has an interviewing team that has been selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3705.503s">And</a>  we have three members of this body, which have also stood up to the plate to say that they will support <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3713.41s">the</a>  principal searches. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3714.851s">We</a>  have member Graham who will be supporting and part of the high school team. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3719.312s">We</a>  have member Hays who will be supporting and part of the elementary school team at the Roberts and we have member McLaughlin who will be supporting the Andrews Middle School team. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3730.636s">So</a>  I wanna thank all three of you in advance for your sacrifice of time and your support of this critically important work that we're going to undertake. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3742.7s">I</a>  also want to just share the aggressive timetable that we're going to be working with, where this week again. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3753.806s">We</a>  have no school on Friday, the applications window will close this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3760.069s">Next</a>  week, during phase one, the interviewing teams that were selected, which include parents, teachers, administrators, school committee members, and we have central office members of the team that are supporting each search. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3777.565s">So</a>  at the Roberts Elementary School, we have Assistant Superintendent, Suzanne Galussi and Principal Kathy Kaye supporting that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3787.031s">At</a>  the Andrews Middle School, we have our Director of Student Services, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3794.336s">Joan</a>  Bowen and Principal Nick Tucci, spearheading that search. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3799.239s">And</a>  at the high school, we have Dr. Peter Cushing and Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3804.682s">the</a>  administrators from the central office team that will be spearheading the high school search. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3812.747s">During</a>  phase one again, as I said, applications the window will close on April, April 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3819.951s">And</a>  during the week of April 10, the week prior to vacation, during phase one, the interviewing teams will be screening and looking at resumes and selecting the candidates for first rounds interviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3840.017s">During</a>  the week of April 17th, we have April vacation break, so school will not be in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3847.142s">Immediately</a>  following break, the week of April 24th at the high school level, the finalists that were recommended by the interviewing teams, each interviewing team will put forward three candidates that they feel are viable candidates to lead the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3870.477s">And</a>  based on those three candidates, when it moves to phase two, the superintendent will be involved at that point. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3877.424s">And</a>  these are three candidates that they can feel are viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3882.008s">And</a>  we will move into phase two and conduct finalist interviews based on the final candidates that were presented from the interviewing team. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3893.938s">It's</a>  critically important during phase one that all people who are selected to be part of the interviewing teams that confidentiality is truly maintained, because some of the candidates, the majority of them will most likely be. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3910.846s">sitting</a>  principals in current districts, and so if they do not move forward to the next phase, then we would not be publicizing that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3925.394s">Also,</a>  sometimes when the information is made public, sometimes it can backfire too early. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3934.819s">And</a>  so, you know, your respective team leads will definitely fill in each interviewing team about the importance of maintaining confidentiality. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3946.305s">So</a>  that's critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3948.426s">The</a>  week of <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3951.247s">April</a>  24 for the high school search team, we will be conducting finalist interviews during that week, with the hope of announcing who the new high school principal will be during the week of May 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3970.47s">Simultaneously</a>  during the week of May 1st, I will be conducting finalist interviews for the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3979.416s">So</a>  there's like an overlap that is taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=3982.898s">And</a>  again, based on those finalist interviews and moving forward from that week of May 1st, the hope is to announce the middle school principal the week of May 8th, the following week. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4000.891s">At</a>  the same time, the week of May 8th, I will be conducting the elementary school interviews for the next elementary school leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4010.572s">And</a>  so the week of May 15th, the hope is to announce the new elementary school principal the week of May 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4020.497s">So</a>  prior to Memorial Day weekend, we would like to have all of the new principals assigned and that information made public. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4034.684s">and</a>  look forward to transitioning with new leaders on July 1, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4041.085s">We're</a>  trying to do a very aggressive timetable because we do know that there are multiple searches happening in neighboring communities, and if we find someone that's really viable and good, a good match for Medford, we don't want to delay that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4062.13s">The</a>  other piece that I just wanted to share with the community and the team, that as the interviewing teams were selected, we really tried to make sure that we were truly inclusive of all of our populations, making sure that we had English learner representation and students with disabilities representation, whether it was students or parents representing the diverse population. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4087.831s">that</a>  we have if it's the vocational at the high school to make sure that we have CTE representation, as well as the comprehensive side. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4096.582s">So</a>  we did take that into consideration at every single level, so that we're hearing from different stakeholders, different voices in different perspectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4108.395s">And</a>  I want to thank all of those who volunteered in advance for being part of this critically important process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4119.04s">And</a>  for those that might not have been selected to be part of the official team, we are going to be creating other opportunities to continue to gather feedback and input from our communities, all three communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4135.106s">So</a>  I just wanted to give the committee that overview and we do have some beautiful programs or flyers which describe each school community and describe the population and just key facts about the different schools and that we are <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4159.377s">tapping</a>  into other resources and partnering with community partners to be able to get the strongest amount of candidates who are interested and would be a good match for Medford to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4174.787s">So</a>  I look forward to, it's a very intense process, but I look forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4179.43s">And</a>  I thank again, the committee for your support during these three principal searches that are gonna be taking place very soon.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4188.636s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4189.097s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent and you don't have to tell us names or anything but do we have a candidate resumes coming in.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4197.355s">Yes,</a>  we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4198.456s">We</a>  have a good amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4200.417s">The</a>  hope is that each, during phase one, they will be able to come down with at least five candidates that they feel we're having good interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4212.826s">And</a>  I've spoken with many colleagues to let them know that we are looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4218.49s">So</a>  I think people will be able to make some good choices.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4223.134s">Wonderful,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4224.374s">And</a>  thank you to all that are serving on those committees to help us bring in three great principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4230.935s">We</a>  do not have any presentations of the public or continued business. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4234.676s">We</a>  do have a reports requested, which is presentation of data for the before and after school program. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4241.337s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4242.057s">Megan</a>  Fidler-Carey, Director of Family and Community Engagement requested by myself to be presented tonight from the March 20th, 2023 meeting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4252.56s">Yes,</a>  and miss for the carry is online. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4254.923s">So,</a>  Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4257.006s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4257.366s">She's</a>  a co host now. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4258.508s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4259.169s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[CrEp94TD4IM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4261.472s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4262.253s">Well,</a>  thank you for letting me chime in by zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4270.678s">Um,</a>  so you had asked in my presentation last at the last meeting, it was more of an update about sort of the state of the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4279.646s">And</a>  then I had proposed some changes to the tuition rate and the pay rates for the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4288.493s">And</a>  then the questions that came back after that were, you know how wanting to make sure that our <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4295.899s">Families</a>  that maybe couldn't afford an increase in tuition were taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4300.361s">So</a>  we wanted a more comprehensive report on the financial assistance plan that we have that we've been doing this year and what and to make sure it would still be viable next year with the increases that we've proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4313.268s">So</a>  you all should have received a report from me. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4315.849s">I</a>  understand that there was a two-page written report, but then there were supporting documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4321.731s">And</a>  I realized this morning that the supporting documents hadn't gone out, but hopefully those have been mailed to you since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4327.854s">Did</a>  you get those?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4330.785s">Yes,</a>  we have received the completed packet, the updated packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4334.586s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[CrEp94TD4IM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4335.346s">Oh,</a>  terrific. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4335.946s">Good.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4336.346s">OK,</a>  so you'll note in the packet, hopefully you had a chance to go through it, that this year we instituted the new financial assistance plan using the self income, the self the income self reporting grid that the the office at City Hall uses for the Community Development Block Grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4357.31s">which</a>  is what their determination for low income for Medford residents is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4361.252s">So</a>  we realized it made sense to keep consistent if there were low income determinations in one body of the municipality, we should keep it consistent through the schools too. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4369.837s">So</a>  we use the same grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4372.31s">And</a>  based on where, you know, once families send us supporting documents for their paycheck stubs and their tax documents, depending where they fall on that grid, they're eligible for 20, 40, or 60% off of the full price of the tuition. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4388.853s">So</a>  we had 27 students take advantage of that option this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4398.444s">And</a>  we also had seven students who were legacied in from the voucher program from the year before. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4405.166s">So</a>  I'll take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4406.826s">You'll</a>  recall about a year ago, we presented to school committee and requested doing away with the voucher system, meaning not renewing our contract with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4416.489s">to</a>  accept vouchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4418.21s">And</a>  the reason we did that was because not enough of our families were taking advantage of the voucher program. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4423.673s">In</a>  fact, we only had 12 last year and we only have seven that are still carried over to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4430.876s">And</a>  it was a very cumbersome process to be eligible to accept those vouchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4435.318s">So</a>  for the very few families that were taking advantage of it and for how cumbersome it was, it wasn't worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4441.141s">Plus</a>  the fact that it meant that a lot of families <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4443.962s">who</a>  didn't necessarily qualify for voucher for whatever reason, had no means of getting financial assistance because we were only allowed to charge as much as voucher reimbursed us for. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4456.369s">So</a>  it made financial sense to be able to help out more families by not accepting vouchers. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4462.453s">And</a>  it was a lot less of a burden for us to go through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4468.456s">But</a>  we decided to legacy in the families who had already been getting vouchers and honor their parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4473.799s">It's</a>  called the parent copay. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4475.72s">That's</a>  what it's called on their voucher system. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4480.382s">So</a>  whatever rate they were quoted by the state, we honored that. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4483.263s">So</a>  regardless of where they fell in that 20, 40 or 60 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4488.516s">So</a>  the 26 students receiving the discounted tuition and the seven voucher rate students represents about 10% of our total registered students in the before and after school programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4503.322s">So</a>  when we went through the process of making sure that this would be viable, making sure that raising our pay rates and raising the tuition rates as much as we <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4513.379s">suggested</a>  that if we still gave all of those discounts, we'd still be viable. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4519.022s">And</a>  if you look at the packet, we've proven that it definitely is. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4522.565s">We</a>  will end up in the black. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4525.126s">So</a>  the way that I went about doing this was I just took the most conservative, I worked, first of all, I worked with Michelle Kingdon in the finance office, and I worked with Suzanne Galusi, the assistant superintendent of academics. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4536.853s">And</a>  we worked on this together sort of untangling <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4540.362s">the</a>  different scenarios different ways to look at it and took the most conservative approach we could think of, which was this. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4547.049s">i'm</a>  uncomfortable with that only 10% of our families are taking advantage of our financial assistance, because I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4556.576s">Either</a>  there are more families who are eligible who don't realize they're eligible or see some sort of stigma for applying for it, or there are families that didn't sign up for before and after school in the first place because they didn't know that we had financial assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4571.479s">So</a>  I see that as a challenge and a goal for myself for the rest of this year and for the summer to do a better job of educating and informing our families so that they know that this is an option for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4584.102s">So</a>  with that said, I'm hoping, I mean, my very, very aggressive goal is to get to 25% of eligible families or eligible students. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4593.509s">So</a>  the conservative way that we looked at these numbers was to suggest that 25% are <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4600.567s">Let's</a>  say we get $0 for 25%, which is not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4604.292s">That's</a>  not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4605.494s">But</a>  that was the way that we could look at the numbers, the dollar numbers, the most conservatively to make sure that we would end up in the black. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4611.822s">So</a>  if you have your report in front of you and you look at page two, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4618.797s">You'll</a>  see all the costs as I listed them on the slide, on slide number 10 at the last school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4624.979s">And</a>  those are the new personnel costs with the increases that I suggested, and our costs for supplies, administrative personnel, the wraparound professionals that we talked about last year and at the last meeting, and our office of community program manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4641.986s">So</a>  with all of those costs, <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4644.167s">and</a>  with the conservative income of full price only for 75% of our eligible seats, we still come out in the black. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4656.035s">So</a>  I'm comfortable with the pay rate increases that we've proposed, and I'm comfortable with the tuition pay rate that we've proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4663.8s">I</a>  think it is enough to cover our costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4669.973s">and</a>  be able to offer financial assistance to even more students than we currently are. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4677.479s">So</a>  I'll take a breath and see if we have any questions from there.</p>

    <p>[CrEp94TD4IM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4705.741s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4706.041s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4706.402s">So</a>  you'll see the letter that I sent out to families, the body of that letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4711.949s">So</a>  that should be the third page in your packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4718.376s">And</a>  this was the amended packet that we sent today. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4721.279s">Okay,</a>  so the body of that letter that I sent in July, I sent that to all families through talking points as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4729.629s">And</a>  it said, the body of that letter, and it said, for more information, please contact the office, which some families did. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4737.352s">I</a>  love talking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4738.693s">And</a>  I, so I immediately, once we got talking points and our enrollment was set, I set up, you can set up different groups at each of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4746.919s">So</a>  I have a group for before school, a group for after school, and that's how I communicate kind of emergency snow information. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4752.642s">That's</a>  how I communicate when, you know, if there's anything coming up that they need to know about.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4759.727s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4760.208s">May</a>  I follow up? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4762.454s">Yeah,</a>  thank you, that's super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4764.495s">And</a>  then I just wanted to ask on the page two for the wraparound professionals, I know that we did talk about this a little bit last week as well, but I just wanted to double check on the inclusivity for students with disabilities and with significant disabilities for the before school and after school program with the budget line item for the wraparound paraprofessionals, is that permitting more opportunity for students with disabilities to be attending these programs?</p>

    <p>[CrEp94TD4IM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4791.207s">Yes,</a>  I believe it could, especially if the qualified paras are the ones applying for that wraparound role. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4799.977s">So</a>  again, the wraparound professionals are in that shifted schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4804.382s">They're</a>  from 11 to 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4806.304s">So</a>  if that works for them, which I anticipate that that will be <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4811.371s">very</a>  beneficial for a lot of people because like me, if they don't have their early mornings free, then it might be a better fit for them to have an 11 to five job than a school hours job. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4821.958s">So</a>  I'm anticipating some paras. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4823.859s">So</a>  especially if we're lucky or convincing to find paras that meet the need that are qualified, then we can certainly open it up in that way.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4836.468s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4836.888s">And</a>  then just as a follow-up, I guess what I'm asking too is that <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4840.1s">It's</a>  not opening it up to students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4842.521s">I</a>  mean, students with disabilities have access to the programming regardless, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4847.102s">So</a>  we are just finding the staffing to ensure that they have access.</p>

    <p>[CrEp94TD4IM_SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4851.423s">Correct,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/X1f0jMHGEbc&t=4852.903s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
