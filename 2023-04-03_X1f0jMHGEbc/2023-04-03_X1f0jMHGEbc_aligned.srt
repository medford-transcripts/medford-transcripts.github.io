Is there a motion on the floor?

20
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:52,167
Motion to approve.

21
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:55,069
I remember McLaughlin, seconded by member Rousseau.

22
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,470

23

Thank you.

29
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:23,849
Yes, we met on the 27th and we were looking at, our two goals were to choose a evaluation template and to start looking at some instructions to go with the template.

30
00:01:24,529 --> 00:01:29,732
We first looked at the DESI's version of a template

31
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:33,357
And then we also talked about whether to create our own template.

32
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:38,340
Ultimately, we did decide to go with the DESI version this year.

33
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:47,464
There was some discussion about some pages being overwhelming or there being a lot of information and maybe needing to highlight certain pieces of information.

34
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:57,869
So we are going to go back and add that into the DESI template, highlighting the specific indicators that we are using this year.

35
00:01:58,887 --> 00:02:07,789
and we will be meeting again on April 21st, 24th, sorry, to finish that up and to finish up the instructions for members.

36
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:09,649
Great, thank you.

00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,157

April is World Autism Awareness Month, and yesterday was Autism Awareness Day.

65
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:51,542
I am proud that the Medford Public Schools, in collaboration with our Medford Police Department, have formed a partnership with the Doug Flutie Jr.

66
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:57,126
Foundation, which helps families affected by autism to live their lives to the fullest.

67
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:02,630
The autism message boards are an important part of our elementary school playgrounds.

68
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,310
One is already posted at the Roberts Elementary School.

69
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:12,033
An additional one will be placed at the McGlynn Elementary School as well.

70
00:04:12,893 --> 00:04:18,796
Let us light up our school community blue to support autism awareness and acceptance.

71
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,912
I also have some great news to share.

72
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:35,355
I'm so pleased to report that the Mustang ethics team placed third in the nation in the national ethics championship held in North Carolina this past weekend.

73
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:43,136
They have worked so hard this year and under the direction of Mr. Esner, we are very proud of their accomplishments.

74
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:49,238
And I just wanna say a large congratulations to our ethics team and thanking this committee for sending them

75
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:52,879
to North Carolina, so I'll give them a round of applause.

76
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:53,819
Congratulations.

77
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:14,643
Additionally, on Saturday, our undefeated Mustang Winter Color Guard team competed at Salem High School in the championship finals and won their highest score of the season, a 96.59.

78
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:18,564
Their performance was choreographed to music

79
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:25,813
The guards used flags, sabers, rifles, along with dance that wowed the crowds.

80
00:05:26,314 --> 00:05:29,198
Congratulations to our winter color guard team.

Congratulations to them as well.

84
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,241
I also just wanna share a little news with CCSR.

85
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:55,729
At the Andrews Middle School, Miss North CCSR Group began a pilot program working with EGOL, a Somerville-based company that supplies feminine products on a roll to try.

86
00:05:55,749 --> 00:06:02,272
The CCSR students will take the data to monitor usage and create a spreadsheet of the findings.

87
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:06,115
Maintenance will soon install the units in the girls' bathrooms.

88
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:16,166
In a month or so, CCSR hopes to present their data to the school committee and see if it is something the district may want to implement at all schools.

89
00:06:17,528 --> 00:06:25,978
Also, our third edition of Coloring Chords from the Fine Arts and Music Department is now available on our website.

90
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,000
Please go and check that out.

91
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,223
And a special thank you to Ms.

92
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:37,829
Suzanne Fee and Haley Rallo, our coordinator of both Fine Arts and Performing Arts.

93
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:50,580
When Mary Briana's egg hunt had to be moved indoors on Saturday due to the rainy weather, our JV softball team jumped in to help.

94
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:56,725
They assisted the Easter bunny to decorate City Hall and helped him to hide eggs.

95
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:03,209
They took photos of all of our students with the bunny, gave out cotton candy, and helped with the cleanup.

96
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,374
I want to say a special thanks to Coach Brenna and the team for volunteering to help our community.

97
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,921
Sorry to interrupt.

98
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:21,066
Not only did they come volunteer, the softball girls with the bunny, but they were the bunny.

99
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,388
Oh, they were the bunny.

100
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:24,729
So that's even better.

101
00:07:25,429 --> 00:07:29,432
Well, thank you to our wonderful students, community service and giving back.

102
00:07:30,172 --> 00:07:33,354
So I truly, truly am just proud and very,

00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,362
excited about the wonderful things that our Mustangs are doing.

104
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:48,228
I wanted to share with the community that this past Friday, we had a fabulous Women's History Month celebration at the high school.

105
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:56,554
And I just want to recognize all of the phenomenal women who came to present to our students.

106
00:07:57,214 --> 00:08:06,939
The auditorium was filled limited seating, but it was a wonderful presentation in celebration of women's history month.

107
00:08:08,436 --> 00:08:19,704
And this diverse group of women were from all different occupations, they encouraged our students to never doubt their dreams and urge them to seek a career that will bring them joy.

108
00:08:19,724 --> 00:08:25,207
The theme of the event was, if you can see her, you can be her.

109
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:28,630

A number of our students were in the cast and I heard them practicing.

135
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,700

00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:37,301
Mic's on.

166
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:38,121
Thank you.

167
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:57,130
So thank you, Mayor Langel-Kern, members of the school committee, Superintendent Dr. Maurice Vincent, for having us here to provide you with what we think is a new, improved Medford Public Schools website.

168
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:10,297
I'm going to start by doing some introductions and acknowledging the amazing people, students, staff, administrators, who helped make this website possible for us.

169
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,323
And then the students will come up and say a few words, and Ms.

170
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:21,825
Miller will also do a presentation, a demonstration of the website's special features.

171
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:29,487
So first I wanted to talk to you about Molly Layden, who is our Director of Library, Media, and Technology.

172
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:40,070
Molly was so instrumental in doing the research for us and trying to find a company that met Medford Public Schools' needs, as well as

173
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,379
talking to the directors in the content areas.

174
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,762
Medford vocational teacher of programming and web development, Lisa Miller.

175
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:55,827
I have to say that her technology expertise is second to none.

176
00:15:56,187 --> 00:16:01,671
And if she wasn't with us, we wouldn't be standing in front of you today.

177
00:16:01,751 --> 00:16:02,572
So thank you to Ms.

178
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:02,872
Miller.

179
00:16:09,332 --> 00:16:11,033
George Tufas is with us tonight.

180
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,034
George, give us a wave.

181
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:28,667
So some of you from City Hall might already know George because he's doing his internship here at Medford City Hall, and he actually helped launch Final Sight here, but he helped us first because we started with him a little bit ago, a few years ago.

182
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:31,950
Kevin Gusmeo, Kevin, wave for us.

183
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,903
Kevin is the team leader, the team manager in Ms.

184
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:39,004
Miller's classroom.

185
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,287
And he's sort of employed a couple of other students.

186
00:16:42,507 --> 00:16:49,193
And when pages come in to be edited or added or deleted, whatever it happens to be, Ms.

187
00:16:49,234 --> 00:16:51,476
Miller will say, Kevin, will you take care of this for us?

188
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:53,417
So Kevin, thank you for your work.

189
00:16:56,052 --> 00:16:58,093
Daniel Skeppel is not with us tonight.

190
00:16:58,153 --> 00:17:03,837
Daniel is currently a freshman at the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth.

191
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:10,022
So Kevin, if you're watching, hello, and I'd like to acknowledge the work that you did on the website as well.

192
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:16,226
Tenzing Lobden isn't here with us tonight, but I would like to acknowledge his work with us.

193
00:17:17,106 --> 00:17:19,508
But Babav Sani is here.

194
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:20,789
Babav, give us a wave.

195
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:25,781
And he's worked hard on the website this past year.

196
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:32,925
I'd also like to just go down and I hope you can bear with me as I acknowledge other people, please.

197
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:41,930
Obviously the school committee, we would not be able to have done all of our work without your cooperation and your collaboration.

198
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,831
So thank you so much for what you've done for us.

199
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:52,879
the administrators, starting with central administration with Dr. Vincent, but I don't know how many meetings I've had with Ms.

200
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:58,280
Galussi, Dr. Cushing, and Joan Bowen herself will tell you, I was in her office numerous times.

201
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:08,322
It was so important for me to make sure, especially for special education and pupil services, that what we put up on the website was correct information.

202
00:18:08,802 --> 00:18:11,703
So I'd like to thank you for your help with that.

203
00:18:13,543 --> 00:18:15,584
We have a posting team in Medford now.

204
00:18:16,164 --> 00:18:25,848
Each one of our schools has a posting person that takes care of the calendar for the school, as well as the school news.

205
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:36,813
So I'd like to thank Jen Conte at the Brooks Elementary School, Allison Guilmette at the Missituck Elementary, Liza Goldman at the Roberts Elementary,

206
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:54,421
Courtney Bell does work for us at both the McGlynn Elementary and the McGlynn Middle School, Azita Poli-Bacon at the Andrews Middle School, Rebecca McGinnis and Maria Dorsey at Medford High School, Medford Vocational and the Curtis Tufts School.

207
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:59,563
So a big thank you to those teachers who have been working with us this past year.

208
00:19:01,451 --> 00:19:02,972
I'm not sure if you know Kat Darnell.

209
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:09,718
She has worked to do the videos of each of the principals and the superintendent.

210
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,220
So I'd like to thank Kat Darnell.

211
00:19:12,881 --> 00:19:15,843
Our CCSR students are everywhere, as you well know.

212
00:19:16,324 --> 00:19:18,085
So they did a lot of photos for us.

213
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,280
Mr. Hesser and his class, I have a special place in my heart for them.

214
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:43,969
We took the vocational bus or van out, and we went to each and every one of the schools, took photos, we used drones, which was really kind of fun, of the teachers, the administrators, so that we had updated pictures as well as of the inside and the outsides of the schools.

215
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:57,311
Mr. Spagnola, once we had all our photos taken, Mr. Spagnola and Mr. John Spagnola and the classroom of students then took those pictures and cropped them and sent them off to Ms.

216
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:00,654
Miller and her students to get onto our website.

217
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:08,701
And I'll just say it one more time, this couldn't have been done without the assistance of Molly Layden and Lisa Miller.

218
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:11,364
So again, thank you so much for what you have done for us.

219
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,001
So I'm going to begin at the beginning.

220
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:35,970
Our goal, after we looked at the website, was to improve communication with our families, with students, staff, and the community by creating an informative, accessible, easy to navigate, and appealing website.

221
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:40,126
We began the conversation around fall of 2021.

222
00:20:41,146 --> 00:20:50,310
I actually have to acknowledge Dave Murphy because I worked very closely with him and we would meet often to make sure we were on the right track.

223
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,171
We looked at our website.

224
00:20:54,031 --> 00:20:56,732
We knew that it needed edits, updates.

225
00:20:56,932 --> 00:20:58,072
There were broken links.

226
00:20:58,672 --> 00:20:59,873
We needed to streamline.

227
00:20:59,953 --> 00:21:01,393
We looked at our resources.

228
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:03,894
We needed navigation improvements.

229
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:05,815
It had to be user-friendly.

230
00:21:06,593 --> 00:21:14,837
more appealing staff directory changes and, you know, oftentimes I would look at the staff directory if I could find it on the website.

231
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:21,601
And there were people who were retired resigned and some who had passed away, and yet still were on the website.

232
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:33,715
We needed to update our policies that you've been working on, current events information, delete obsolete information, get better images.

233
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:44,884
But one thing I think that Lisa, Molly and I agreed upon is we wanted more of our students' pictures, photos on the website because it is all about them.

234
00:21:45,645 --> 00:21:48,027
So we were happy to get lots of photos.

235
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,488
So that's where it began.

236
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:52,748
We started our research.

237
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:53,849
Ms.

238
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:56,011
Layden was tasked to do this research.

239
00:21:56,652 --> 00:22:08,342
So on her technology listserv, she had discussions with her tech directors about reliability, accessibility, tech support.

240
00:22:09,303 --> 00:22:16,990
And so we came up with four different companies, edLeo, Educational Network, Catapult, and Finalsight.

241
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:23,153
So our focus was to look at the designs that these four companies had.

242
00:22:24,214 --> 00:22:25,635
Maintenance was really important.

243
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:30,117
As you well know that some of the maintenance wasn't happening with our old website.

244
00:22:30,157 --> 00:22:31,658
We wanted to keep it up to date.

245
00:22:32,698 --> 00:22:40,383
Accessibility was extremely important, whether it was for our EL families or for our special education families.

246
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:45,465
We looked at news features, the payment system.

247
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:48,407
We wanted to make sure that we had a consistent payment system.

248
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:54,216
And right now we are using one, so I'm happy that we have BlueSnap on board.

249
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:56,619
Social media feeds.

250
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:03,368
So we looked at having two for the district and then two for each and every school.

251
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:05,390
Cloud storage.

252
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:14,700
forms integration, content management, and a mobile app, which I'm happy to say, we have our mobile app up and running.

253
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:24,684
So you can go to your app store and for parents, they can, if you're looking just to go to the Roberts Elementary or the Andrews Middle School, you can put that on your mobile app now.

254
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:31,626
After all of our research and discussions and Zooms and conversations with these companies,

255
00:23:32,841 --> 00:23:37,403
Final Sight was the company that could deliver everything we were looking for.

256
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:48,449
So when we decided on Final Sight, we then went to the different districts to see what they looked like, North Andover, Hockington, Norton, and Brockton.

257
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:57,934
And we decided that we would take the best from each of them and incorporate them into Medford Public Schools.

258
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,251
So one of my favorite days was when we did the theme selection.

259
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:06,174
George, Kevin, and Daniel were there.

260
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:07,055
And Ms.

261
00:24:07,075 --> 00:24:17,382
Miller said to the students, well, you need to present to central administration and to the principals what your favorite theme is from final site.

262
00:24:17,902 --> 00:24:19,403
Not a problem for these young men.

263
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:24,247
They got together and they chose what was good for them, what they liked.

264
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:33,198
And they just get up, and I think there was a secret, I don't know if it, what did we use for a, not secret ballot.

265
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:36,299
Was it Survey Monkey or something?

266
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:40,901
Google Forms.

267
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:51,866
So each of our administrators chose what they thought the best theme for Metro Public Schools was, and that's how we came up with what we have today.

268
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:54,207
We were then,

269
00:24:55,322 --> 00:24:58,763
tasked with creating district and school sites.

270
00:24:59,163 --> 00:25:09,084
This wasn't easy because we were trying to take the information that we knew was important from our current site and then add information to that.

271
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:22,147
I was working with the superintendent and the assistant superintendents on a regular basis and with all the principals to discuss what they wanted their school site to look like.

272
00:25:22,747 --> 00:25:24,127
So my thanks obviously go to

273
00:25:25,103 --> 00:25:25,303
Ms.

274
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,043
Galluzzi, Ms.

275
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,484
Bowen, and Dr. Cushing once again for that.

276
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:42,028
One thing we didn't know when we started this project, or at least I'll speak for myself, one thing I didn't know was that we had eight additional websites within Medford Public Schools, and I was really surprised by that.

277
00:25:43,748 --> 00:25:48,450
One of them is an amazing website created by a student, the CCSR website.

278
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,810
If you take a look at that, one of our kids did that from a few years ago.

279
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:53,711
That is still up and running.

280
00:25:54,409 --> 00:26:04,674
Our athletics website is still up and running and we decided that that would be in our phase two because it was too much to put in for this current year.

281
00:26:05,674 --> 00:26:11,336
But the counseling had a website, the Metro Family Network, the speech and language, a lot of different websites.

282
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:17,139
So we were able to fold in those websites for the most part into the new Metro Public Schools website.

283
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,301
One of the interesting things last summer with

284
00:26:22,103 --> 00:26:30,642
especially George and Kevin was, we were working throughout the summer, and George goes to Greece every summer with his family who are here, so thank you for being here.

285
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:37,022
So we gave George work to do, but we didn't expect him to do a lot, it was his vacation.

286
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:43,047
But he would email, text, let us know, okay, I'm done with that, what else do you need me to do?

287
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:44,929
And this was during his vacation.

288
00:26:45,649 --> 00:26:50,813
And Kevin went to, was it Acapulco or Mexico, and then he went to Florida.

289
00:26:51,414 --> 00:26:54,276
And in the middle of his vacation, he would email Ms.

290
00:26:54,316 --> 00:26:57,499
Miller and myself and say, I'm done with this project, what's next?

291
00:26:58,119 --> 00:26:58,900
So the boys,

292
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:01,809
have gone above and beyond.

293
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:04,210
And for me, this is so amazing.

294
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,152
So thanks so much, guys, for doing what you do.

295
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:15,457
We still have ongoing work on the staff directory that needs to be updated four times a year.

296
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:21,481
We need to edit our content areas, which we're constantly doing now.

297
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:27,331
creating easy to find school committee agendas, archived information.

298
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:35,413
I don't know about you, but anytime I tried to find out what was going on in the school committee, it took me probably five to eight minutes.

299
00:27:36,013 --> 00:27:39,094
And now it doesn't anymore because you have your own tab.

300
00:27:39,675 --> 00:27:44,776
You just click on it and it says agenda and we get right to the minutes after that.

301
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:50,338
So I'm happy that at least I can get continued, even though I'm not really here, I've retired,

302
00:27:50,748 --> 00:27:52,550
I can, I still watch school committee meetings.

303
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:57,776
So, and our consistent payment system to me was really important as well.

304
00:27:58,737 --> 00:28:01,139
So, I thank you for your time for me.

305
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:08,687
And now I'd like to take a moment to introduce Kevin, who's going to begin with accessibility.

306
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:09,368
Come on up, Kevin.

307
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,941
Before I start, I just wanted to thank Ms.

308
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,241
Miller, Ms.

309
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:20,862
Codwell, and Ms.

310
00:28:20,902 --> 00:28:23,622
Layden for their opportunity that they gave me to work on this website.

311
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:26,183
So I'm Kevin.

312
00:28:26,623 --> 00:28:29,084
I'm a senior in the programming and web development shop.

313
00:28:29,604 --> 00:28:31,905
I'm also the student manager of the website.

314
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:36,947
To me, the most important aspect of this website has been accessibility.

315
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:39,448
And it's something that we have prioritized.

316
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:44,272
So this school district is a very diverse school district.

317
00:28:44,572 --> 00:28:50,978
And with that respectfully, there's a lot of languages being spoken by students, faculty, and parents.

318
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:55,121
So it was of utmost importance to us that we make the website multilingual.

319
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:56,763
And that's what we did.

320
00:28:57,383 --> 00:29:01,667
And we do that through WEGLOC, which is a translation service built into our website.

321
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:03,208
It's very easy to use.

322
00:29:03,288 --> 00:29:07,372
You just click on the language that you want to be translated and the page gets translated.

323
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:12,999
I also wanted to mention too that our website is screen reader friendly.

324
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:22,067
Every link has a title, every image has an alt text, and we pull text out of images so that they can be screen read and translated.

325
00:29:22,687 --> 00:29:23,608
Thank you for your time.

326
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:33,977
I've been neglected to mention he's going to the UMass Lowell in the fall.

327
00:29:34,077 --> 00:29:34,698
Thank you, Kevin.

328
00:29:36,633 --> 00:29:37,894
Vavav, can you come up, please?

329
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,895
Vavav was interested in communication.

330
00:29:42,756 --> 00:29:46,698
Hello, my name is Vavav Saini, and I also want to thank Ms.

331
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:47,259
Caldwell and Ms.

332
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,260
Miller for giving me the opportunity to work on their website.

333
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,704
I'm a senior at the program web development shop in Bedford High School, and what I learned and love about the website work is communication.

334
00:29:56,844 --> 00:30:05,088
I think I learned how to email more professionally, communicate with people in person online, and how to convey messages in various types of posts.

335
00:30:05,612 --> 00:30:11,714
I think communication is a very valuable skills because you can really change the outcome of new posts comes out or just talking to someone.

336
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:13,074
Thank you for your time.

337
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:22,997
And Baboff is off to the University of Mass in Boston, correct?

338
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:23,457
Yes.

339
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:23,898
Good.

340
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:25,418
George, come on up.

341
00:30:30,316 --> 00:30:30,556
Hello.

342
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:32,517
Before I start, I want to thank Ms.

343
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:32,918
Miller and Ms.

344
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:35,079
Caldwell for the opportunity they gave me to work on the website.

345
00:30:35,639 --> 00:30:35,859
Hello.

346
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:36,660
I'm George Tufas.

347
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,442
If you didn't know already, I worked at Medford City Hall as a website intern.

348
00:30:41,203 --> 00:30:47,286
And me and the mayor's office team successfully launched, redesigned, and published the website for Medford City Hall.

349
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:52,930
My favorite part of working at Medford Public Schools website was going down with Ms.

350
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,072
Caldwell to different departments and basically sitting with them.

351
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:07,027
going through their part of the page as part of their site and seeing if information needed to go away or we have to put more new information in.

352
00:31:07,047 --> 00:31:13,854
It was basically a one-on-one and it made the process more easier, more friendlier for the department head.

353
00:31:14,615 --> 00:31:15,275
Thank you for your time.

354
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:16,216
And once again, thank you, Ms.

355
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:17,317
Caldwell and Ms.

356
00:31:17,337 --> 00:31:17,558
Miller.

357
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,462
George is off to UMass, Lowell next year as well.

358
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:32,106
I think they underplay who they really are because when work comes into Ms.

359
00:31:32,146 --> 00:31:39,311
Miller, because that's where it comes, she just gives it to the students and they know what to do at this point.

360
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:40,271
And I know Ms.

361
00:31:40,311 --> 00:31:45,135
Miller is working on hopefully continuing this process in the following.

362
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,155
All right, Ms.

363
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:48,537
Miller, would you please come up and do a demonstration?

364
00:31:59,229 --> 00:31:59,369
mind.

365
00:31:59,389 --> 00:31:59,949
That was great.

366
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:00,669
Thank you.

367
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:04,571
So I would like to first thank Miss Caldwell.

368
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:08,072
I'm sure that building a website was not her retirement plan.

369
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:16,835
And she has stepped up and gone way beyond all, you know, I don't know, we had high expectations.

370
00:32:16,855 --> 00:32:17,915
So not, you know, but

371
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:22,377
I think she's done a phenomenal job, and it's been really a pleasure working with her.

372
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:29,802
And it's, it's been fun to see you grow as a website developer.

373
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:33,485
I'd also like to just say thank you to the students.

374
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:35,106
I also think that they

375
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,048
are rather humble.

376
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:40,569
They have done a phenomenal job.

377
00:32:40,949 --> 00:32:44,950
They are some of the most professional web developers I've worked with at this point.

378
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,871
I have complete confidence in them.

379
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,692
When something comes in, I'll say, oh, just send an email to so-and-so.

380
00:32:52,312 --> 00:32:55,673
And they've really just stepped up to the task.

381
00:32:56,434 --> 00:33:05,116
They take their responsibilities extremely seriously and address things like the accessibility issues, making sure that all the images have

382
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,679
alt text and that sort of thing.

383
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:12,241
So I have really been impressed and I'm a very proud teacher of them.

384
00:33:12,361 --> 00:33:18,763
So with that, I'd like to just go ahead and highlight a couple of the features of the website.

385
00:33:20,044 --> 00:33:32,849
I'm hoping that most people here have already seen the website, but it is structured differently than websites that we've had in the past in the sense that there is the district site and then each school has its own

386
00:33:33,904 --> 00:33:37,287
site that can be accessed through the top navigation.

387
00:33:37,788 --> 00:33:49,958
The design of the website is such that each school has its own website and the district has a website, but it's all a similar design so that there's a consistency across the site.

388
00:33:49,998 --> 00:33:54,842
So you feel like you haven't really left the site, but each school has its own photos.

389
00:33:55,823 --> 00:33:58,145
The homepage has the slideshow.

390
00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:03,342
The quick links, these would be the same for all but things for like school meals, everybody checks the school meals.

391
00:34:03,864 --> 00:34:05,709
That's one of our, our big sites.

392
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:15,888
We have a video of the principals and then the news and the calendar.

393
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:23,592
It's been really great having people at the schools, posting news, updating the school calendars, having these up to date.

394
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:29,455
And I'm hoping that it's been a service to the community.

395
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:36,099
One of the things that I think is really important about the website, as Caldwell mentioned this,

396
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:42,309
The staff directory, we do have a staff directory that the staff information is stored in a database.

397
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,954
We can come here under the about go to staff directory.

398
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:58,144
This would be the entire staff directory that can be filtered based on school or department name, but that same information we use to

399
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,147
Actually, this would just be the high school.

400
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,548
If it was on the district, it would be the entire district.

401
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:08,830
The schools have theirs, as well as each department or the nursing staff.

402
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,331
And it all is pulled from the same database.

403
00:35:11,351 --> 00:35:24,635
So we're really hoping that we don't have that obsolete information where some random name gets left or part of the site gets updated, but another part doesn't, because we're working off a common database for the directories.

404
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:37,087
It has you know all of the academics and departments and stuff one of the things so that I wanted to, I'm not going to go through all of the website but there's a couple things I wanted to highlight, because I find.

405
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:42,115
One of the things I've really enjoyed seeing is that the website get used more and more.

406
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:47,678
And so we've had ideas come in from the community of staff at the schools.

407
00:35:47,798 --> 00:35:50,079
And so I just want to go to the district.

408
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:58,764
And so one of the things that I think is great is Suzanne Fee has come up with the idea of having art galleries at each of the schools.

409
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:00,605
And so we now have

410
00:36:03,544 --> 00:36:10,088
And we were able to accommodate this, the students implemented this, then trained Ms., you know, gave a, did some professional development for Ms.

411
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:12,269
P about how to actually add all the images.

412
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,771
So each gallery, each school has a gallery.

413
00:36:16,332 --> 00:36:22,015
If we were to go to the high school, there are different collections that can be viewed.

414
00:36:23,036 --> 00:36:24,817
If we wanted to look at the most recent one.

415
00:36:26,172 --> 00:36:32,436
So this is an idea that I think is wonderful because people have seen the website and have said, ah, that's great.

416
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:33,637
And people are using it.

417
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:36,378
What could I do to add to that?

418
00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:42,282
And so this would be, I think, a great example of that happening.

419
00:36:42,502 --> 00:36:44,323
We also have a nursing blog now.

420
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:54,809
So the nursing staff approached us and said, could we do something, have a monthly nursing blog?

421
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:58,064
And so now we have, come down here.

422
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:05,228
Is it?

423
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:06,669
There's an emergency out there.

424
00:37:16,174 --> 00:37:17,255
Where do we put the nursing blog?

425
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:17,755
Is it?

426
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:22,578
I thought it was under health services, but I know Kevin will know.

427
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:28,614
Is it student life, or do you know where the nursing blog went?

428
00:37:29,975 --> 00:37:38,020
Yeah, so I thought it was under, yeah.

429
00:37:40,641 --> 00:37:49,486
Anyway, the idea is really that people are seeing the website and thinking about what can be added to it, and I've been really inspired by that.

430
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,448
I think we're going to go ahead and go.

431
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:55,589
Thanks, Kevin.

432
00:37:55,609 --> 00:38:03,532
I'm going to go back to the slide presentation, because there's a little bit of information I wanted to share.

433
00:38:03,892 --> 00:38:12,196
Some of the things like scholarships, we've been working with guidance, and they've said, you know, like, well, we could put the scholarship information there or community service information.

434
00:38:12,216 --> 00:38:13,937
So we use the boards to do that.

435
00:38:15,177 --> 00:38:16,318
students are doing that as well.

436
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:22,662
And then I just wanted to show you the Google Analytics from the website usage.

437
00:38:24,523 --> 00:38:27,385
The one on the upper right is for the last year.

438
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:32,869
You can see it's fairly flat, flat, flat until about August when we launched.

439
00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:35,171
And that's when you kind of get the

440
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:39,074
as George says, the heartbeat going up and down.

441
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:45,521
It is used a lot more during weekdays and weekends, so that's kind of where the up and down comes from.

442
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:49,064
You can see that there's been 114,000 visitors to the website.

443
00:38:52,984 --> 00:38:53,705
in the last year.

444
00:38:55,145 --> 00:39:01,510
If you look at the lower one, I don't know if you can see it with the captions over it, but that is a 10-day period.

445
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:07,334
Typically on a given school day, slightly over 1,000 people a day visit the website.

446
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:13,818
It's lower than that, usually around 500 on the weekends.

447
00:39:14,398 --> 00:39:22,184
The most visited pages are the homepage, school brains, the printable school calendar, breakfast and lunch menu, staff portal, and staff directory.

448
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:24,959
are currently most visited pages.

449
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:29,766
And then as Ms.

450
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:35,428
Caldwell said, the very newest thing that just happened is the mobile app is now available.

451
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:37,388
It's done through final site as well.

452
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:43,290
It is an app that pulls data from the website.

453
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,112
So when we post news, it automatically gets pulled into the app.

454
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:52,594
When we post events on the calendar, it automatically gets pulled into the app.

455
00:39:53,014 --> 00:39:55,695
There's also links to the website for things like,

456
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,976
the lunch menu and stuff.

457
00:39:59,476 --> 00:40:06,678
It is just available, I think last Thursday was the first day, it is available both in the Play Store and the App Store.

458
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:15,721
There might be some quirks to it still, it's new and there's a couple things we need to work on with Final Sight, but it is available for download right now.

459
00:40:17,293 --> 00:40:20,095
One of the things that's really nice is you're able to filter by school.

460
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:25,057
So if you have a student at the Missittuck and the high school, you'll just get them, you can filter it.

461
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:29,019
So you just get the information from the Missittuck and the high school.

462
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,601
So that's been very exciting.

463
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:35,082
And then there's all the thank yous.

464
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:35,703
And I think Ms.

465
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:36,823
Caldwell has already done that.

466
00:40:37,484 --> 00:40:43,847
So I would like to thank you for listening and a wonderful website team here.

467
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:52,808
Member McLaughlin?

468
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,529
Actually, Member Rousseau was first, if you don't mind.

469
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:56,349
Member Rousseau?

470
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:56,930
Thank you.

471
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,090
This is great.

472
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,571
As soon as it was available, I was all over it.

473
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:02,432
I'm very happy.

474
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:02,892
Thank you.

475
00:41:03,152 --> 00:41:11,095
I'm curious, what are the big outstanding challenges?

476
00:41:11,275 --> 00:41:14,916
In particular, I'm wondering about how we implemented search.

477
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,201
You know, is it just all Google?

478
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:21,083
And is it connected to everything properly?

479
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:25,386
Because I know that Google sells a lot of stuff and nothing's cheap from Google.

480
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,688
So we are using a final site search.

481
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:44,260
So like, if I, if somebody creates a Google Doc, and it's just automatically available through final site search, how do... So if you had a link in a post that was to a Google Doc,

482
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:50,321
Yeah, I'm just thinking about, for instance, the example of the school committee agendas.

483
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:53,342
Google Docs are used to create the agendas.

484
00:41:54,282 --> 00:41:59,724
Do they all have to be published and uploaded into the cloud for final site to even know they exist?

485
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:02,745
So I think that we're posting everything as PDFs right now.

486
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:04,106
So the agendas are PDFs.

487
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:06,486
So those aren't really searchable.

488
00:42:08,087 --> 00:42:08,967
That was my question, really.

489
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:09,768
Is it not searchable?

490
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:13,069
So the agendas are not really searchable, I think.

491
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:20,089
PDFs are sort of going through a transition time right now where there are some PDF formats that are a little bit more searchable than others.

492
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,830
But in general, we don't think of them as searchable.

493
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:40,614
So the agendas would not be, but if it was deemed something important, we could tag them with certain categories or tags if there was like certain things we wanted that we then would be able to search for through the final site search on the website.

494
00:42:41,112 --> 00:42:41,752
It's a lot of work.

495
00:42:42,432 --> 00:42:46,173
Well, I mean, it's, somebody would have to tell, we wouldn't probably do it ourselves.

496
00:42:46,473 --> 00:42:48,293
Somebody would have to say, oh, this should be tagged.

497
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:58,015
But like all of tonight's many PDFs won't be, like if you went to the search, you won't find anything that's in there.

498
00:42:58,035 --> 00:42:59,415
You wouldn't find the content.

499
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:08,337
Like if you were looking for, if there, you know, if the word banana was in one of the documents and you search for banana, you wouldn't find that document.

500
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:08,657
Great.

501
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:09,237
Thank you.

502
00:43:09,397 --> 00:43:09,977
Did you want to?

503
00:43:10,899 --> 00:43:13,440
Um, I, I don't actually know what I want.

504
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:22,005
I think that, you know, you know, there's obviously a hazard of connecting a search tool directly up to all of our Google accounts.

505
00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:23,926
That could be

506
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:31,796
you know, you're trying to draft something and somebody can just search and read the next school committee agenda before you've even published it or something.

507
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:35,679
But um, yeah, so I think that that's not going to happen.

508
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,582
I mean, the other thing in this is separate than from the school committee stuff.

509
00:43:39,662 --> 00:43:42,645
If we're getting information for news posts,

510
00:43:44,586 --> 00:44:14,238
If there's information like the date and the time and the location that's embedded in a PDF or a JPEG image, the students will usually pull that information out, display the image, have that important text underneath it so that it can be translated using our translation tools, screen read for somebody who's using a screen reader, and it's searchable then using the search tool on the website.

511
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:16,182
Thank you.

512
00:44:18,886 --> 00:44:19,607
Member McLaughlin.

513
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:20,588
Thank you.

514
00:44:21,188 --> 00:44:22,230
This looks really great.

515
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,212
I love the clean design.

516
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:29,218
It's really, and I'm super excited about the accessibility and the all text and all that.

517
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:30,540
So thank you guys very much for

518
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:32,710
being so conscientious about that.

519
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:39,954
And I guess I'm wondering, does that, so to member Russo's point about the PDFs.

520
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:47,398
So if the agendas are not in a searchable PDF format, are they not able to be translated?

521
00:44:48,158 --> 00:44:48,538
That's right.

522
00:44:48,779 --> 00:44:48,979
Yeah.

523
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:58,624
So then we might want to think about that just in terms of translation access, because it's actually one of the things we were talking about at a previous meeting about having our materials translated.

524
00:44:58,684 --> 00:45:00,645
So I don't know what that involves, but

525
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:07,560
it's just something to consider because it is something that we've been talking about in terms of, and so is that the same for policy?

526
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:12,905
So the policy handbook, is that a PDF as well, or is that searchable?

527
00:45:13,806 --> 00:45:15,408
I am not sure about that, I'd have to check.

528
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,089
Okay, if we could, that would be great.

529
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:25,918
Because same thing, I think if people want to know what policy is on something, if they could search for it, that's great, and or have it translated is fantastic.

530
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:27,286
Yeah, I agree.

531
00:45:27,306 --> 00:45:37,072
And I would love to see going forward there being more of a district wide strategy about documents, being able to be translated, being able to be screen read.

532
00:45:37,272 --> 00:45:40,153
Yeah, have a consistent format that we would like to use.

533
00:45:40,173 --> 00:45:42,495
So I would love to work with anybody who would like to do that.

534
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:43,756
Okay, so then.

535
00:45:44,316 --> 00:45:44,996
Okay, thank you.

536
00:45:45,016 --> 00:45:47,638
So it's really about thinking about how to be consistent with the format.

537
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:54,402
Yeah, it sounds like okay, and and having that format be one that we can use for screen readers and translation.

538
00:45:54,904 --> 00:45:55,304
Oh, good.

539
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:55,664
All right.

540
00:45:55,704 --> 00:45:59,466
Maybe that's something we can talk about is in terms of policy, um, around that.

541
00:45:59,486 --> 00:46:00,066
So thank you.

542
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:14,631
And then, um, I wanted to ask, so since all of these fantastic students are going on to, uh, their next careers and thankfully with the website that they can show for the work that they've been doing on their, uh, resume, which is excellent.

543
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:19,313
Uh, I'm wondering about sustainability and the plan for the future.

544
00:46:19,353 --> 00:46:21,774
I know that you said that there's a phase, additional phases.

545
00:46:22,586 --> 00:46:23,306
that you're working on.

546
00:46:23,407 --> 00:46:25,928
So if you guys wouldn't mind sharing a little bit about that.

547
00:46:26,468 --> 00:46:26,588
Yeah.

548
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:32,951
So I think, I mean, part of this will be depend on the director of communications and how that role plays out.

549
00:46:34,172 --> 00:46:47,819
I am currently trying to recruit some students, train them this year, have them be involved in training, providing guidance to some younger students who will then take over at least the student website team aspect.

550
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:50,861
I think that we need to work on, you know, will the,

551
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:57,795
Schools continue to be able to have people in them that can post news and update their calendars.

552
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:04,500
So that would be something that hopefully we can move, you know, can continue next year.

553
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,364
There are bigger tasks, things like, do we want to use the final site module for athletics?

554
00:47:11,545 --> 00:47:12,686
That's a separate module.

555
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:14,027
There'd be separate costs.

556
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:18,070
Currently, we have not really fully incorporated athletics into the website.

557
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,872
So that would be something that we could consider.

558
00:47:21,694 --> 00:47:24,855
but there is cost and time.

559
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,996
Somebody has to do it, there's a cost to final site.

560
00:47:28,816 --> 00:47:34,618
Thank you for mentioning that because that made me wonder also, I wanted to just ask about the pay portal.

561
00:47:35,078 --> 00:47:37,258
So does that, what does that pay portal work for?

562
00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:41,720
So would that work for, for example, like the summer fun camp when people are signing up for summer fun?

563
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,340
Yeah, great.

564
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,421
So we currently, I think that they're just starting to use it for some of the MBTA passes through the high school.

565
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,922
They used it for-

566
00:47:51,388 --> 00:47:52,429
Athletics has been used.

567
00:47:52,509 --> 00:47:53,430
Oh, athletics is using.

568
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:53,770
Oh, good.

569
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:53,970
Yeah.

570
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,113
So that's, that is that aspect of athletics is, is happening.

571
00:47:58,273 --> 00:47:59,034
Community schools.

572
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:01,716
Not yet.

573
00:48:01,816 --> 00:48:08,020
The AP exams were paid for through the pay portal and summer school.

574
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:13,484
Okay.

575
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,166
Will community schools be added?

576
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:16,247
Do we know for the pay portal?

577
00:48:16,407 --> 00:48:17,187
We can look into that.

578
00:48:17,387 --> 00:48:17,568
Yeah.

579
00:48:17,648 --> 00:48:18,048
Thank you.

580
00:48:18,408 --> 00:48:18,788
Excellent.

581
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:19,949
Excellent job.

582
00:48:20,109 --> 00:48:20,470
You guys.

583
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:20,830
Thank you.

584
00:48:23,217 --> 00:48:23,698
Member Graham.

585
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:24,759
Thank you.

586
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:40,579
Yeah, I think there's a lot of places where if we are going to adopt a pay portal like presuming that it has all the appropriate safeguards in place that we should be looking at all the places where we ask families to send money.

587
00:48:41,533 --> 00:48:46,798
like lost library books, cash flows in to the library.

588
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:52,763
And I think it has to go to city hall to come back to be able to buy and replace the book.

589
00:48:52,803 --> 00:49:08,576
So I'm hoping that if we can really get to a single pay portal for everything that has to do with our schools, it would, it would be a really glorious day for everybody, I think, because I think parents just are like, where do you want me to go?

590
00:49:08,596 --> 00:49:09,277
What do you want me to do?

591
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:12,171
It would be nice if all of that stuff was in one place.

592
00:49:13,772 --> 00:49:19,457
So, and I think on the topic of athletics that was that was a list on my list of questions for you all.

593
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:24,281
I would like to see athletics be pulled into the mainstream of this website.

594
00:49:25,646 --> 00:49:29,548
I think athletics is a critical part of what we do at Medford Public Schools.

595
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:42,795
And lots of people want to know about our athletics teams, not just our athletics teams, by the way, all the teams that we have, all of our extracurriculars, but it's really sort of hard to find them right now.

596
00:49:42,895 --> 00:49:51,660
And the track team was here a few weeks ago and in going back and forth, the coach has done a really wonderful job maintaining his own website

597
00:49:52,574 --> 00:50:00,658
for the track team, which is great, but that is a ton of work on him that is over and above all of his other coaching responsibilities.

598
00:50:01,178 --> 00:50:14,044
So I'd like to see there be a better mechanism for the athletics teams and any of the teams that have a lot of activity to be able to tell the community what they're all about on a website that could be something that meets their needs.

599
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:21,387
So I do think that is worth looking into, not just for athletics, but for athletics in any of the clubs like the ethics team

600
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:22,899
and all the others.

601
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:37,484
And then I guess my final question is whether you have found and decommissioned all of the other versions of the website, because every now and then I go searching for something, and I land somewhere that's quite old.

602
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:45,327
So I'm just curious, how can we shut them down in a permanent way so that there's only one place to go?

603
00:50:45,747 --> 00:50:48,068
So as you've noticed, they are not decommissioned completely.

604
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:55,742
They are redirected to our website, but some of those deep buried documents still show up.

605
00:50:57,243 --> 00:51:07,028
And so I think that that, you know, there's been a while where we've been a little bit hesitant, especially early on, because we weren't sure if there were still documents there that we needed access to.

606
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:09,769
I think probably the time has come that we should be permissioned.

607
00:51:10,726 --> 00:51:12,446
Every now and then, I land on an old website.

608
00:51:12,466 --> 00:51:13,607
I'm like, how did I get here?

609
00:51:15,647 --> 00:51:24,488
I didn't think I was looking for anything that obscure but I think to my colleague's point, the last thing I'll say is we get a lot of questions about how to find school committee documents.

610
00:51:24,588 --> 00:51:39,111
So, I will put a resolution on the agenda for us to think about at a future meeting in terms of how we can be better connected to the work that you all are doing and start to address some of the feedback that we get about how to find our documents, where to go,

611
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:46,600
you know, and sort of all of those, that sort of realm of questions that we get from the community.

612
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,140
So I will do that for a future meeting.

613
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:48,920
That'd be great.

614
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:50,541
We would love to work with you.

615
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:55,843
We tried to take the content from the old site, organize it the best we could, but it's a lot.

616
00:51:56,123 --> 00:52:00,765
I think that it would be great to work with you and to be able to move it even farther forward.

617
00:52:01,245 --> 00:52:01,525
Perfect.

618
00:52:01,565 --> 00:52:01,906
Thank you.

619
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:02,966
Thank you.

620
00:52:04,383 --> 00:52:04,804
Member Kretz?

621
00:52:05,084 --> 00:52:13,495
Yes, thank you very much and thank you to the students for all your help and it's it's really it's a it's dramatic improvement from the other website.

622
00:52:13,555 --> 00:52:15,918
So I downloaded the app last night and

623
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,601
I'm very lazy.

624
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:18,781
I don't like to turn my computer on.

625
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:19,742
I always want to use an app.

626
00:52:19,802 --> 00:52:21,423
So I was really happy to see that.

627
00:52:21,963 --> 00:52:23,364
And I just had one question.

628
00:52:24,525 --> 00:52:28,067
Will we be able to see all the same information on the app?

629
00:52:28,147 --> 00:52:31,469
I know you're still in the process of building it and getting it ready.

630
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:40,455
So at one point, will you have to, can you use the app for everything or will you have to still go on the website onto a computer?

631
00:52:40,835 --> 00:52:45,818
Will they have the same exact information, the app and the actual computer or desktop?

632
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:59,137
So the app will only have access to the staff directory, the news, the events, and links to special sites that we've highlighted, like school grades, lunch menu.

633
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:02,410
The website, though, is responsive.

634
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:07,832
And so if you were to go into your web browser on your phone, you would have access to the full website.

635
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:12,733
And so it's not going to pull in all of the hundreds of pages that are on the website.

636
00:53:13,514 --> 00:53:18,395
It just highlights those things that are sort of changing, like I said, events and calendar stuff and lunch menus.

637
00:53:18,815 --> 00:53:26,198
But one of the things that we've tried very hard to do is make sure that the website is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.

638
00:53:27,018 --> 00:53:27,478
Thank you.

639
00:53:27,518 --> 00:53:28,199
Thank you very much.

640
00:53:28,259 --> 00:53:28,519
Thank you.

641
00:53:30,984 --> 00:53:33,565
Thank you, thank you for your hard work.

642
00:53:33,746 --> 00:53:47,553
At some point, Mayor, we'd like to get a photo of the school committee without their masks on, because what I have, what we have is you with your mask, so we could do that tonight if you would like.

643
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:51,175
With the gentleman that helps with the website, I think there'll be a great picture.

644
00:53:51,656 --> 00:53:52,536
Oh, Mia's not here.

645
00:53:52,756 --> 00:53:53,637
Oh, Mia's not here.

646
00:53:54,117 --> 00:53:54,957
Yeah, we'll do that anyway.

647
00:53:55,918 --> 00:53:56,118
Yes.

648
00:53:57,019 --> 00:53:57,339
Gotcha.

649
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,439
Okay.

650
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:01,798
just going to do it now.

651
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:04,760
So thank you gentlemen for all your hard work.

652
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,600
I'm going to turn it over to the superintendent.

653
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,741
We have citations for you.

654
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:10,622
There's a way to say thank you.

655
00:54:11,182 --> 00:54:16,484
Yes, so we are really, really excited and I want to recognize you officially.

656
00:54:17,565 --> 00:54:22,967
First, your two members of the team that are in absentia, Daniel Skeppel and

657
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:35,854
Tenzing lobbed in so we know that they can't be with us today but we still wanted to recognize them officially.

658
00:54:36,735 --> 00:54:38,778
And we have certificates.

659
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:43,664
So the first certificate that I will read certificate of recognition.

660
00:54:44,525 --> 00:54:50,627
This certificate is proudly presented for your extraordinary contributions to our district website.

661
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:59,371
Kevin Guzmayo, we are celebrating you because you did more, did it better and always exceeded our expectations.

662
00:55:00,011 --> 00:55:05,453
And so it's signed by the school committee and myself, the superintendent of schools.

663
00:55:05,493 --> 00:55:06,814
We wanna thank you so much.

664
00:55:08,434 --> 00:55:08,634
Ms.

665
00:55:08,674 --> 00:55:09,915
Caldwell, Ms.

666
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:11,015
Layden and Ms.

667
00:55:11,075 --> 00:55:12,196
Miller as well.

668
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,078
So you'll each get a certificate.

669
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:20,664
Kevin Guzmayo, George Tufas, and Babar Sani.

670
00:55:21,165 --> 00:55:22,046
Please come forward.

671
00:55:51,343 --> 00:55:51,946
Thank you very much, Mark.

672
00:56:32,475 --> 00:56:34,778
It's not really the time.

673
00:57:05,558 --> 00:57:06,959
All set.

674
00:57:29,622 --> 00:57:38,953
Next up we have recommendation to approve submission of Massachusetts School Building Authority, MSBA core program statement of interest, SOI application.

675
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:41,776
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent.

676
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,060
Good evening again.

677
00:57:48,197 --> 00:57:53,461
As you know, last year we went through a very intensive process.

678
00:57:54,042 --> 00:57:56,263
And unfortunately at the end of that process.

679
00:57:57,845 --> 00:58:00,547
We weren't able to advance to the next phase.

680
00:58:04,029 --> 00:58:15,562
The time has come, and we are reapplying as a district to MSBA the Massachusetts school building authority for the core program and we are resubmitting our statement of interest.

681
00:58:16,462 --> 00:58:18,304
And so I come before this body.

682
00:58:19,365 --> 00:58:26,951
As an official requirement to ask you to support our statement of interest to the MSBA core program.

683
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:40,141
And I attach the additional communication that we also shared with the Medford City Council, and I am expected to go before their body next week on Tuesday, April 11 2023.

684
00:58:42,582 --> 00:58:49,845
and the deadline for resubmission to MSBA is next week as well on April 14th.

685
00:58:51,306 --> 00:58:52,046
Motion to approve.

686
00:58:52,786 --> 00:58:53,887
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

687
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:59,949
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Cresson-Hayes.

688
00:59:00,689 --> 00:59:01,890
Roll call, please.

689
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:22,403
Before the roll call, I just want to let everyone know I've been to the State House four times over the last 30 or so days to meet with each president, one of the Senate, one of the House, and both speakers to have in my job, each mayor had a little job.

690
00:59:22,443 --> 00:59:26,265
Mine was for MSBA funding and Chapter 70, so local aid.

691
00:59:27,406 --> 00:59:32,408
So I'm trying on my end, so let's just, yeah, pray on this one.

692
00:59:33,508 --> 00:59:43,052
I also would just like to invite any of the members who would like to come join me next week when I present the MSBA to the council.

693
00:59:43,932 --> 00:59:51,374
If your schedule permits, you're more than welcome to be part of that official request because we need a vote from the city council as well.

694
00:59:52,035 --> 00:59:52,395
Thank you.

695
00:59:52,895 --> 00:59:55,156
Thanks, and I hope that, I'm sure that will go very smoothly

696
00:59:56,343 --> 01:00:06,529
MSBA likes to see that the whole city government is supportive of this and excited to move forward and ready and willing to ask our residents to support this endeavor.

697
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:08,370
So I'm sure that will go wonderfully.

698
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:11,051
Roll call vote, please.

699
01:00:12,132 --> 01:00:16,234
Thank you, Mayor, for your work and Superintendent as well.

700
01:00:16,374 --> 01:00:21,276
I know it feels like we keep trying, but we will keep trying.

701
01:00:21,537 --> 01:00:22,097
Member Graham?

702
01:00:22,517 --> 01:00:22,777
Yes.

703
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:23,998
Member Hayes?

704
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:25,694
Member Kretz?

705
01:00:25,834 --> 01:00:26,054
Yes.

706
01:00:26,835 --> 01:00:27,555
Member McLaughlin?

707
01:00:27,855 --> 01:00:28,095
Yes.

708
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:30,296
Member McStone, absent.

709
01:00:30,536 --> 01:00:31,536
Member Russo, yes.

710
01:00:31,676 --> 01:00:32,436
Mayor Lungo-Kern?

711
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:34,797
Yes, 16 affirmative, one absent.

712
01:00:35,077 --> 01:00:35,917
Motion is approved.

713
01:00:37,138 --> 01:00:42,019
Next up, we have the report on the three Medford Public School principal searches and timetables.

714
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,880
Dr. Edward Vincent again, our superintendent.

715
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:48,978
Yes, good afternoon, or good evening, I should say.

716
01:00:49,459 --> 01:01:01,528
So this presentation right now is to just share that we are at a crossroads where we have three principalships available or open at the same exact time.

717
01:01:02,149 --> 01:01:10,735
And so we have the Roberts Elementary School, we have the Andrews Middle School, and we have Medford High School.

718
01:01:11,696 --> 01:01:29,410
So we have posted all three jobs and the application process is open for all of the schools until Friday, April, or until April 5th, excuse me, Wednesday, April 5th.

719
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:45,483
We had families or members of the community, parents and caregivers sign up, and every single school community has an interviewing team that has been selected.

720
01:01:45,503 --> 01:01:52,430
And we have three members of this body, which have also stood up to the plate to say that they will support

721
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,451
the principal searches.

722
01:01:54,851 --> 01:01:58,512
We have member Graham who will be supporting and part of the high school team.

723
01:01:59,312 --> 01:02:10,576
We have member Hayes who will be supporting and part of the elementary school team at the Roberts and we have member McLaughlin who will be supporting the Andrews Middle School team.

724
01:02:10,636 --> 01:02:21,740
So I wanna thank all three of you in advance for your sacrifice of time and your support of this critically important work that we're going to undertake.

725
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:31,985
I also want to just share the aggressive timetable that we're going to be working with, where this week again.

726
01:02:33,806 --> 01:02:39,069
We have no school on Friday, the applications window will close this week.

727
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:56,765
Next week, during phase one, the interviewing teams that were selected, which include parents, teachers, administrators, school committee members, and we have central office members of the team that are supporting each search.

728
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:06,131
So at the Roberts Elementary School, we have Assistant Superintendent, Suzanne Galussi and Principal Kathy Kaye supporting that process.

729
01:03:07,031 --> 01:03:14,316
At the Andrews Middle School, we have our Director of Student Services, Ms.

730
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:18,779
Joan Bowen and Principal Nick Tucci, spearheading that search.

731
01:03:19,239 --> 01:03:23,622
And at the high school, we have Dr. Peter Cushing and Dr. Bernadette Riccardelli,

732
01:03:24,682 --> 01:03:30,526
the administrators from the central office team that will be spearheading the high school search.

733
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:38,631
During phase one again, as I said, applications the window will close on April, April 5.

734
01:03:39,951 --> 01:03:58,224
And during the week of April 10, the week prior to vacation, during phase one, the interviewing teams will be screening and looking at resumes and selecting the candidates for first rounds interviews.

735
01:04:00,017 --> 01:04:06,241
During the week of April 17th, we have April vacation break, so school will not be in session.

736
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:29,637
Immediately following break, the week of April 24th at the high school level, the finalists that were recommended by the interviewing teams, each interviewing team will put forward three candidates that they feel are viable candidates to lead the school.

737
01:04:30,477 --> 01:04:36,703
And based on those three candidates, when it moves to phase two, the superintendent will be involved at that point.

738
01:04:37,424 --> 01:04:41,407
And these are three candidates that they can feel are viable.

739
01:04:42,008 --> 01:04:53,238
And we will move into phase two and conduct finalist interviews based on the final candidates that were presented from the interviewing team.

740
01:04:53,938 --> 01:05:09,006
It's critically important during phase one that all people who are selected to be part of the interviewing teams that confidentiality is truly maintained, because some of the candidates, the majority of them will most likely be.

741
01:05:10,846 --> 01:05:24,434
sitting principals in current districts, and so if they do not move forward to the next phase, then we would not be publicizing that information.

742
01:05:25,394 --> 01:05:32,918
Also, sometimes when the information is made public, sometimes it can backfire too early.

743
01:05:34,819 --> 01:05:44,704
And so, you know, your respective team leads will definitely fill in each interviewing team about the importance of maintaining confidentiality.

744
01:05:46,305 --> 01:05:47,625
So that's critically important.

745
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:49,606
The week of

746
01:05:51,247 --> 01:06:08,144
April 24 for the high school search team, we will be conducting finalist interviews during that week, with the hope of announcing who the new high school principal will be during the week of May 1.

747
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:18,916
Simultaneously during the week of May 1st, I will be conducting finalist interviews for the Andrews Middle School.

748
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:21,738
So there's like an overlap that is taking place.

749
01:06:22,898 --> 01:06:39,650
And again, based on those finalist interviews and moving forward from that week of May 1st, the hope is to announce the middle school principal the week of May 8th, the following week.

750
01:06:40,891 --> 01:06:48,788
At the same time, the week of May 8th, I will be conducting the elementary school interviews for the next elementary school leader.

751
01:06:50,572 --> 01:06:59,997
And so the week of May 15th, the hope is to announce the new elementary school principal the week of May 15th.

752
01:07:00,497 --> 01:07:13,744
So prior to Memorial Day weekend, we would like to have all of the new principals assigned and that information made public.

753
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:20,345
and look forward to transitioning with new leaders on July 1, 2023.

754
01:07:21,085 --> 01:07:40,629
We're trying to do a very aggressive timetable because we do know that there are multiple searches happening in neighboring communities, and if we find someone that's really viable and good, a good match for Medford, we don't want to delay that process.

755
01:07:42,130 --> 01:08:07,151
The other piece that I just wanted to share with the community and the team, that as the interviewing teams were selected, we really tried to make sure that we were truly inclusive of all of our populations, making sure that we had English learner representation and students with disabilities representation, whether it was students or parents representing the diverse population.

756
01:08:07,831 --> 01:08:16,001
that we have if it's the vocational at the high school to make sure that we have CTE representation, as well as the comprehensive side.

757
01:08:16,582 --> 01:08:27,575
So we did take that into consideration at every single level, so that we're hearing from different stakeholders, different voices in different perspectives.

758
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:38,119
And I want to thank all of those who volunteered in advance for being part of this critically important process.

759
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:54,366
And for those that might not have been selected to be part of the official team, we are going to be creating other opportunities to continue to gather feedback and input from our communities, all three communities.

760
01:08:55,106 --> 01:09:18,076
So I just wanted to give the committee that overview and we do have some beautiful programs or flyers which describe each school community and describe the population and just key facts about the different schools and that we are

761
01:09:19,377 --> 01:09:34,167
tapping into other resources and partnering with community partners to be able to get the strongest amount of candidates who are interested and would be a good match for Medford to apply.

762
01:09:34,787 --> 01:09:38,830
So I look forward to, it's a very intense process, but I look forward to it.

763
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:47,976
And I thank again, the committee for your support during these three principal searches that are gonna be taking place very soon.

764
01:09:48,636 --> 01:09:48,877
Thank you.

765
01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:56,307
Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent and you don't have to tell us names or anything but do we have a candidate resumes coming in.

766
01:09:57,355 --> 01:09:57,975
Yes, we do.

767
01:09:58,456 --> 01:10:00,057
We have a good amount.

768
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:12,726
The hope is that each, during phase one, they will be able to come down with at least five candidates that they feel we're having good interest.

769
01:10:12,826 --> 01:10:18,390
And I've spoken with many colleagues to let them know that we are looking.

770
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:22,573
So I think people will be able to make some good choices.

771
01:10:23,134 --> 01:10:23,974
Wonderful, thank you.

772
01:10:24,374 --> 01:10:29,415
And thank you to all that are serving on those committees to help us bring in three great principals.

773
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:34,536
We do not have any presentations of the public or continued business.

774
01:10:34,676 --> 01:10:40,857
We do have a reports requested, which is presentation of data for the before and after school program.

775
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:41,577
Ms.

776
01:10:42,057 --> 01:10:50,719
Megan Fidler Carey, Director of Family and Community Engagement requested by myself to be presented tonight from the March 20th, 2023 meeting.

777
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,603
Yes, and miss for the carry is online.

778
01:10:54,923 --> 01:10:56,205
So, Dr. Cushing.

779
01:10:57,006 --> 01:10:57,346
Thank you.

780
01:10:57,366 --> 01:10:58,307
She's a co host now.

781
01:10:58,508 --> 01:10:58,848
Perfect.

782
01:10:59,169 --> 01:10:59,549
Thank you.

783
01:11:01,472 --> 01:11:02,232
Hello.

784
01:11:02,253 --> 01:11:07,820
Well, thank you for letting me chime in by zoom.

785
01:11:10,678 --> 01:11:19,626
Um, so you had asked in my presentation last at the last meeting, it was more of an update about sort of the state of the program.

786
01:11:19,646 --> 01:11:27,712
And then I had proposed some changes to the tuition rate and the pay rates for the staff.

787
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:34,618
And then the questions that came back after that were, you know how wanting to make sure that our

788
01:11:35,899 --> 01:11:40,261
Families that maybe couldn't afford an increase in tuition were taken care of.

789
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:52,608
So we wanted a more comprehensive report on the financial assistance plan that we have that we've been doing this year and what and to make sure it would still be viable next year with the increases that we've proposed.

790
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:55,829
So you all should have received a report from me.

791
01:11:55,849 --> 01:12:01,611
I understand that there was a two-page written report, but then there were supporting documents.

792
01:12:01,731 --> 01:12:07,794
And I realized this morning that the supporting documents hadn't gone out, but hopefully those have been mailed to you since then.

793
01:12:07,854 --> 01:12:08,574
Did you get those?

794
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:14,506
Yes, we have received the completed packet, the updated packet.

795
01:12:14,586 --> 01:12:14,926
Thank you.

796
01:12:15,346 --> 01:12:15,806
Oh, terrific.

797
01:12:15,946 --> 01:12:16,106
Good.

798
01:12:16,346 --> 01:12:36,830
OK, so you'll note in the packet, hopefully you had a chance to go through it, that this year we instituted the new financial assistance plan using the self income, the self the income self reporting grid that the the office at City Hall uses for the Community Development Block Grant.

799
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:40,732
which is what their determination for low income for Medford residents is.

800
01:12:41,252 --> 01:12:49,777
So we realized it made sense to keep consistent if there were low income determinations in one body of the municipality, we should keep it consistent through the schools too.

801
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:50,958
So we use the same grid.

802
01:12:52,310 --> 01:13:07,553
And based on where, you know, once families send us supporting documents for their paycheck stubs and their tax documents, depending where they fall on that grid, they're eligible for 20, 40, or 60% off of the full price of the tuition.

803
01:13:08,853 --> 01:13:16,215
So we had 27 students take advantage of that option this year.

804
01:13:18,444 --> 01:13:24,486
And we also had seven students who were legacied in from the voucher program from the year before.

805
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:26,286
So I'll take a step back.

806
01:13:26,826 --> 01:13:36,029
You'll recall about a year ago, we presented to school committee and requested doing away with the voucher system, meaning not renewing our contract with the state.

807
01:13:36,489 --> 01:13:37,690
to accept vouchers.

808
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:43,612
And the reason we did that was because not enough of our families were taking advantage of the voucher program.

809
01:13:43,673 --> 01:13:50,015
In fact, we only had 12 last year and we only have seven that are still carried over to this year.

810
01:13:50,876 --> 01:13:54,858
And it was a very cumbersome process to be eligible to accept those vouchers.

811
01:13:55,318 --> 01:14:00,721
So for the very few families that were taking advantage of it and for how cumbersome it was, it wasn't worth it.

812
01:14:01,141 --> 01:14:03,602
Plus the fact that it meant that a lot of families

813
01:14:03,962 --> 01:14:15,769
who didn't necessarily qualify for voucher for whatever reason, had no means of getting financial assistance because we were only allowed to charge as much as voucher reimbursed us for.

814
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:22,092
So it made financial sense to be able to help out more families by not accepting vouchers.

815
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:27,936
And it was a lot less of a burden for us to go through that process.

816
01:14:28,456 --> 01:14:33,599
But we decided to legacy in the families who had already been getting vouchers and honor their parents.

817
01:14:33,799 --> 01:14:35,600
It's called the parent copay.

818
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:38,221
That's what it's called on their voucher system.

819
01:14:40,382 --> 01:14:42,983
So whatever rate they were quoted by the state, we honored that.

820
01:14:43,263 --> 01:14:45,884
So regardless of where they fell in that 20, 40 or 60 percent.

821
01:14:48,516 --> 01:15:01,241
So the 26 students receiving the discounted tuition and the seven voucher rate students represents about 10% of our total registered students in the before and after school programs.

822
01:15:03,322 --> 01:15:12,465
So when we went through the process of making sure that this would be viable, making sure that raising our pay rates and raising the tuition rates as much as we

823
01:15:13,379 --> 01:15:18,442
suggested that if we still gave all of those discounts, we'd still be viable.

824
01:15:19,022 --> 01:15:22,465
And if you look at the packet, we've proven that it definitely is.

825
01:15:22,565 --> 01:15:24,446
We will end up in the black.

826
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:35,933
So the way that I went about doing this was I just took the most conservative, I worked, first of all, I worked with Michelle Kingdon in the finance office, and I worked with Suzanne Galluzzi, the assistant superintendent of academics.

827
01:15:36,853 --> 01:15:39,655
And we worked on this together sort of untangling

828
01:15:40,362 --> 01:15:47,029
the different scenarios different ways to look at it and took the most conservative approach we could think of, which was this.

829
01:15:47,049 --> 01:15:54,817
i'm uncomfortable with that only 10% of our families are taking advantage of our financial assistance, because I think.

830
01:15:56,576 --> 01:16:11,039
Either there are more families who are eligible who don't realize they're eligible or see some sort of stigma for applying for it, or there are families that didn't sign up for before and after school in the first place because they didn't know that we had financial assistance.

831
01:16:11,479 --> 01:16:23,342
So I see that as a challenge and a goal for myself for the rest of this year and for the summer to do a better job of educating and informing our families so that they know that this is an option for them.

832
01:16:24,102 --> 01:16:32,688
So with that said, I'm hoping, I mean, my very, very aggressive goal is to get to 25% of eligible families or eligible students.

833
01:16:33,509 --> 01:16:37,772
So the conservative way that we looked at these numbers was to suggest that 25% are

834
01:16:40,567 --> 01:16:44,252
Let's say we get $0 for 25%, which is not going to happen.

835
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:45,153
That's not possible.

836
01:16:45,494 --> 01:16:51,182
But that was the way that we could look at the numbers, the dollar numbers, the most conservatively to make sure that we would end up in the black.

837
01:16:51,822 --> 01:16:55,648
So if you have your report in front of you and you look at page two,

838
01:16:58,797 --> 01:17:04,959
You'll see all the costs as I listed them on the slide, on slide number 10 at the last school committee.

839
01:17:04,979 --> 01:17:21,306
And those are the new personnel costs with the increases that I suggested, and our costs for supplies, administrative personnel, the wraparound professionals that we talked about last year and at the last meeting, and our office of community program manager.

840
01:17:21,986 --> 01:17:23,487
So with all of those costs,

841
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:32,713
and with the conservative income of full price only for 75% of our eligible seats, we still come out in the black.

842
01:17:36,035 --> 01:17:43,780
So I'm comfortable with the pay rate increases that we've proposed, and I'm comfortable with the tuition pay rate that we've proposed.

843
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,761
I think it is enough to cover our costs.

844
01:17:49,973 --> 01:17:54,517
and be able to offer financial assistance to even more students than we currently are.

845
01:17:57,479 --> 01:18:01,702
So I'll take a breath and see if we have any questions from there.

846
01:18:05,265 --> 01:18:06,065
Member McLaughlin.

847
01:18:07,206 --> 01:18:07,586
Thank you.

848
01:18:08,567 --> 01:18:10,709
Thank you for the presentation, Ms.

849
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:11,289
Fidler-Carey.

850
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:15,852
I just wanted to ask, especially around the percentage of

851
01:18:17,810 --> 01:18:23,377
folks who are taking advantage of the discounted tuition, what have you, is any of this material translated?

852
01:18:25,741 --> 01:18:25,981
Yes.

853
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:26,161
Yes.

854
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:31,929
So you'll see the letter that I sent out to families, the body of that letter.

855
01:18:31,949 --> 01:18:35,614
So that should be the third page in your packet.

856
01:18:38,376 --> 01:18:41,259
And this was the amended packet that we sent today.

857
01:18:41,279 --> 01:18:48,448
Okay, so the body of that letter that I sent in July, I sent that to all families through talking points as well.

858
01:18:49,629 --> 01:18:55,816
And it said, the body of that letter, and it said, for more information, please contact the office, which some families did.

859
01:18:57,352 --> 01:18:58,473
I love talking points.

860
01:18:58,693 --> 01:19:06,678
And I, so I immediately, once we got talking points and our enrollment was set, I set up, you can set up different groups at each of the schools.

861
01:19:06,919 --> 01:19:12,602
So I have a group for before school, a group for after school, and that's how I communicate kind of emergency snow information.

862
01:19:12,642 --> 01:19:18,006
That's how I communicate when, you know, if there's anything coming up that they need to know about.

863
01:19:19,727 --> 01:19:20,188
Thank you, Mayor.

864
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:20,808
May I follow up?

865
01:19:22,454 --> 01:19:23,915
Yeah, thank you, that's super helpful.

866
01:19:24,495 --> 01:19:50,427
And then I just wanted to ask on the page two for the wraparound professionals, I know that we did talk about this a little bit last week as well, but I just wanted to double check on the inclusivity for students with disabilities and with significant disabilities for the before school and after school program with the budget line item for the wraparound paraprofessionals, is that permitting more opportunity for students with disabilities to be attending these programs?

867
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:59,696
Yes, I believe it could, especially if the qualified paras are the ones applying for that wraparound role.

868
01:19:59,977 --> 01:20:04,362
So again, the wraparound professionals are in that shifted schedule.

869
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:05,743
They're from 11 to 5.

870
01:20:06,304 --> 01:20:10,408
So if that works for them, which I anticipate that that will be

871
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:21,918
very beneficial for a lot of people because like me, if they don't have their early mornings free, then it might be a better fit for them to have an 11 to five job than a school hours job.

872
01:20:21,958 --> 01:20:23,519
So I'm anticipating some paras.

873
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:34,106
So especially if we're lucky or convincing to find paras that meet the need that are qualified, then we can certainly open it up in that way.

874
01:20:36,468 --> 01:20:36,808
Thank you.

875
01:20:36,888 --> 01:20:39,730
And then just as a follow-up, I guess what I'm asking too is that

876
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,481
It's not opening it up to students with disabilities.

877
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:47,002
I mean, students with disabilities have access to the programming regardless, right?

878
01:20:47,102 --> 01:20:50,823
So we are just finding the staffing to ensure that they have access.

879
01:20:51,423 --> 01:20:52,183
Correct, yes.

880
01:20:52,903 --> 01:20:53,263
Thank you.

881
01:20:56,404 --> 01:20:56,884
Member Graham.

882
01:20:57,824 --> 01:21:02,625
I'd like to make a motion to approve the staff increases and the tuition rate increases.

883
01:21:03,946 --> 01:21:06,686
Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

884
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:07,767
All those in favor?

885
01:21:09,312 --> 01:21:14,193
All those opposed, motion passes six in the affirmative, one absent.

886
01:21:16,494 --> 01:21:17,014
Thank you, Ms.

887
01:21:17,494 --> 01:21:18,114
Fidelicari.

888
01:21:19,214 --> 01:21:19,574
Thank you.

889
01:21:20,114 --> 01:21:20,655
Thank you very much.

890
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:21,615
I very much appreciate it.

891
01:21:26,136 --> 01:21:29,276
Number 10, we have two, three condolences.

892
01:21:30,517 --> 01:21:35,498
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Sally C.

893
01:21:36,246 --> 01:21:47,929
Tardif, mother of Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School, Special Education, ETL, Amy Delano, and former assistant director of the Medford Voc Tech High School, Jill Sawyer.

894
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:58,753
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Selena Trafford, mother of Kim Clinton, coordinator of special education, Andrews Middle School, and Medford High School.

895
01:22:00,333 --> 01:22:03,694
And the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Gail

896
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:09,661
Paulson Back Miller, mother of Ivy Nelson, special education teacher at Medford High School.

897
01:22:09,681 --> 01:22:11,462
If we all may rise for a moment of silence.

898
01:22:26,966 --> 01:22:29,687
Our next regularly scheduled meeting is

899
01:22:31,354 --> 01:22:37,781
here at the Alden Memorial Chambers, Bedford City Hall, and via Zoom next Monday, April 10th at 6 p.m.

900
01:22:37,882 --> 01:22:43,468
We also have a budget meeting that same night, April 10th at 4.30 p.m.

901
01:22:43,528 --> 01:22:44,309
to 6 p.m.

902
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:51,537
Otherwise, have a wonderful weekend, rest of the week, and motion to adjourn by member
